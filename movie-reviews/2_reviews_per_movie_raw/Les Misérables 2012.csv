"CalRhys","Null","77","99","26 September 2014"," A Well-Executed And Powerful Musical
","A well-executed and powerful musical from Tom Hooper, 'Les Misérables' stood alongside 'Skyfall' as Britain's two main entries at the 2013 Academy Awards and left with 3 Oscars. Featuring some bravura performances from an all-star cast including Anne Hathaway (Oscar winner), Hugh Jackman (Oscar nominated), Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Set against the sweeping backdrop of 19th-century France, 'Les Mis' tells an enthralling and emotional story of passion, love and redemption, accompanied by some stunning cinematography, uplifting musical numbers and flawless direction. While it does drag on at parts, 'Les Mis' is generally an impeccably crafted musical to be enjoyed by all."

","I went to an awards screening of Les Miserables and left the cinema speechless. Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography, costumes, art design and editing are nothing short of genius.<br/><br/>Hooper's idea to have the actors sing live really brings a deeper emotion to the film not seen in other movie musicals. Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as Fantine - the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments, and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.<br/><br/>Also, a great supporting turn from newcomer Samantha Barks as the heartbroken Eponine (look out for her waist - it's absolutely tiny!), who is sure to be shot into stardom. Eddie Redmayne, Russell Crowe and Aaron Tveit are also good, and there's some great comedy relief from Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>It will leave you laughing, crying, and feeling inspired. A great watch, sure to win some major awards this year! 10/10!"

","This film is amazing. Absolutely incredible. I don't understand what people are saying about pacing issues, I thought it flowed beautifully. The changes made worked very well. And I didn't think there was any weak link in the cast. I honestly loved Russell as Javert. He wasn't traditional by any means, but what he did worked. <br/><br/>The cgi was not the best, but it kind of created this fantastical other world while still being realistic and grounded. <br/><br/>So many of the acting choices were brilliant and subtle. For example Jackman ever so slightly altered his voice with his characters aging, which I thought was brilliant. <br/><br/>There is no negative thing to say about this movie. However, I do see why a critic may not like it. It's not a critic movie. There isn't a lot of impressive violence, crazy camera shots, etc. the things critics seem to love. It's more grounded in the performances and the story, which it tells extremely well. <br/><br/>The only thing I can point out (because I saw it with my boyfriend who knows nothing about the story) there are two or three slightly confusing plots for those who aren't familiar with Les Mis. But they are either explained later on or not important enough to dwell on. <br/><br/>Anyways, that's my rant. Needless to say I will be seeing it many many times and cannot wait for the DVD so I can own it and watch it even more."
"tinulthin","9","206","307","22 December 2012"," Les Misérables
","The guiding ethic of any film adaptation of a legendary source must be: ""Change as little as possible."" Those in charge of Les Miz knew precisely what they were working with. A few songs are shortened, a handful of lines altered, and a few scenarios condensed or adapted to their original literary form, but the whole remains gloriously and satisfyingly intact.<br/><br/>The Work Song is set to the image of a hundred convicts battling a stormy sea to pull a listing ship into dry dock—and only here does the film's live-recording ethic fall short, as the music and voices lack the power to match the imagery, seemingly washed out by the sea noise, where the live musical would normally captivate from the first note.<br/><br/>Neither of them theatrical belters, Jackman and Crowe's performances feel subdued in the opening scene. But the film finds its gravitas the instant Colm Wilkinson appears as the Bishop of Digne, and from that instant, the next two and a half hours are nothing less than the repeated sliding of the viewer's soul up and down a finely-honed blade.<br/><br/>The ability to take close-ups gives the film an intimacy that is unattainable on a Broadway stage, and power numbers are sometimes reduced to a chilling whisper. Anne Hathaway destroys herself to bring Fantine to life, and her incredible, personal pain washes in waves from the screen. The tooth removal, normally excised from the musical, is even back from the book—though modified in location. Confrontation is then viscerally set as a full-on close-quarters sword fight.<br/><br/>Film also allows a depth of scale that challenges the stage. The transition to At the End of the Day is a grim and powerful scramble through the slums of Paris, shaking the screen with the palpable rage of a nation. Look Down is another tour de force, while Do You Hear the People Sing emerges from a quiet, elegiac call to arms that organically overtakes General Lamarque's funeral procession.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks' Éponine lights up in her every interaction with Marius, and shots of her in the background of A Heart Full of Love are soul-rending. But she suffers just enough tiny cuts that A Little Fall of Rain is not quite as arresting as it should be, and the constant close-ups amputate the power of a scene that should captivate not only through its intimacy, but through the inactivity that washes across the entirety of a once-violent stage.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe's soft-voiced Javert takes some getting used to, and while it works more often than one might expect, he sometimes seems to be singing with a sock in his mouth—most notably during One Day More, where he seems to have been mixed in at a different volume level from the rest of the cast. Yet the cinematography of Stars is simple yet stunning, and Javert's Suicide suffers nothing in this interpretation.<br/><br/>M. Thénardier endures a few cuts (most notably the truncation of Dog Eats Dog), but Sacha Baron Cohen steals enough asides and chews enough scenery that his part hardly feels reduced.<br/><br/>The background has been filled in with elements from the novel, and those who have read Hugo's epic will appreciate nods to Fauchelevent and the Petit-Picpus convent, Gavroche's elephant-home, Marius' grandfather, and the tavern behind the barricade. There is even a quick cut to Gavroche when Éponine is shot, winking at their normally undisclosed sibling relationship.<br/><br/>Even the finale remains perfectly and satisfyingly intact. The only challenge with a film that so precisely parallels its stage inspiration is resisting the necessity to deliver a standing ovation once the final note has been sung. If only they had found a way to incorporate a curtain call."
"rogerdarlington","Null","324","501","8 December 2012"," Even if you don't like musicals, you really should see this one
","As a massive film fan, my tastes are very wide-ranging, but I do have a problem with musicals. Nevertheless I was happy to take the opportunity of a private viewing of ""Les Misérables"" at the London office of distributors Universal - the day after the London première and a month before the UK release - because of the outstanding success of the original stage show (a run of 27 years with a total audience of over 60 million) and the surprising and impressive cast list (Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne). <br/><br/>The showing was introduced by producer Eric Fellner of Working Title who underlined the commercial challenge of making a film in which all the dialogue is sung and the themes are so political and praised director Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"") for his insistence that every take was sung live.<br/><br/>The two main characters are presented in the opening seconds of a sweeping introductory sequence: the police inspector Javert (Crowe) and the prisoner 24601 Jean Valjean (Jackman) in post-revolutionary France. There follows over two and half hours with barely a spoken word which will not appeal to all cinema-goers, but the production is a triumph with Cameron Mackintosh's musical opened up by dramatic shooting on Pinewood's brand new Richard Attenborough stage and some historic English locations. <br/><br/>If Crowe and especially Jackman are excellent, Hathaway - who lost 25 pounds and most of her hair for the role - is outstanding as the destitute Fantine and Cohen and Carter almost steal the show as the comical Thénardier innkeepers.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how long it will take for ""Les Misérables"" to recoup its investment cash- wise, but it's going to win award after award and rightly so."
"Eric-Low","10","274","435","17 December 2012"," Magnificent Live-Production Captured On Film!
","What an innovative film!<br/><br/>Contrary to one of the reviews which canned everything about the movie from the plot to the actors' singing voices to camera angles (by someone who, to me, is obviously not familiar with the live theater productions of this musical nor it appears the he has ever been to any), I find this movie version is a a state-of-the-art capture of one the world's great musicals for the cinema screens!<br/><br/>The live singing is superb, showing the fragility (and flaws) of every performer ... and that's what a live-performance is all about! This movie captured a live theater production on screen for all cinema goers who never had the chance to enjoy a live theater production!<br/><br/>Kudos to everyone involved! A must-see for all! And a must-buy for those who wish to have a copy of this masterpiece for a keepsake!"
"jamieblaurie","10","243","390","26 December 2012"," I Cried in the Parking Lot
","As a huge fan of the musical, I have religiously followed this film through its production from behind-the-scenes to trailers to sneak-peaks. And let me tell you, Les Mis did not disappoint! From the very beginning and the first swells of the orchestra's music, I was hooked. And through the whole 2.5 hour movie, I was riveted.<br/><br/>Singing: Everybody was great! Russell Crowe was not PHENOMENAL, but was excellent in ""Stars"" and ""Javert's Soliloquy"". Hugh Jackman, too, had his weak moments...but really wowed during ""Who am I?"" and ""Bring Him Home"". Anne Hathaway gave the best vocal performance, followed closely by Samantha Barks.<br/><br/>Acting: A fantastic performance from the whole ensemble. Again, Anne Hathaway blew everybody else out of the water. Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were also excellent in terms of emotional delivery. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen were the much needed (and absolutely hilarious) comedic relief. <br/><br/>Production: One of the best period films I've seen. The costuming, makeup, hair and set design were impeccable. I really liked how people weren't made to be ""pretty"" as Hollywood often does; thankfully, the actors' teeth were not left movie-star white.<br/><br/>Overall, one of the best movies I've seen. I cried at least 10 times through the whole film, and the finale completely RUINED me. I was sobbing a full 15 minutes after the movie ended, walking through the theatre and out to the car.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for everyone!"
"Danusha_Goska","8","132","214","25 December 2012"," Why We Pay to Watch Others Suffer
","Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath? <br/><br/>If you can watch this film without crying, I don't want to know you. The woman behind me was on the edge of her seat, not just because I smell good. The audience at the 10:40 a.m. matinée – the theater was packed – applauded at the end, and was very slow to leave the theater, even as the closing credits rolled. <br/><br/>Typical of big, fat, nineteenth-century novels, there are numerous implausible coincidences that drive the plot. These coincidences took me out of the movie, but that was a good thing. The human suffering on screen was overwhelming: suicide, enslavement, exploitation of living humans' body parts, prostitution, disease, spite, malice, child abuse, starvation, sadism, a dying man escaping through very graphic sewerage. I did have to repeat to myself, ""This is only a movie"" even as tears streamed down my cheeks. <br/><br/>Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children. He slaves for twenty years. He hauls a massive, capsized sailing ship. The scene does look like obviously fake CGI, but that doesn't make it any less gut wrenching. The workers sing, ""You'll always be a slave. You are standing in your grave."" They are the men we see in Sebastiao Salgado photographs of Third World laborers. They are Ilya Repin's ""Barge Haulers on the Volga."" Valjean's nemesis is the crazily obsessive policeman, Javert. They spar throughout the film, as Valjean's fate rises and falls and rises and falls and rises  you get the idea. <br/><br/>A story this big, this broad, and this implausible requires one hundred percent commitment from the performers. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is superb. He believes. He emotes. He is as big as the story itself. Jackman is the heart and soul of ""Les Miserables."" I loved him. Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen – they all had me convinced. Russell Crowe was a surprising disappointment. He's a brilliant actor and I kept waiting for him to bring some fire, some ice, some power, some insight to Javert, the obsessive and punitive policeman who mercilessly hounds Jean Valjean. I wanted a memorable moment that would make me feel that Crowe's performance brought Javert to intimate life for me. That moment did not arrive. <br/><br/>I wondered while watching this movie whether it will be embraced by the political left or the political right. It is a deeply and unashamedly Christian film. A Catholic priest, emulating Jesus, is the catalyst. Valjean spends the rest of the film working to live up to the priest's Biblical example. ""Les Miserable"" is leftist in that it depicts the poor rising up, but then the poor fail their own putative saviors, and allow them to be massacred, alone. Javert, representing law and order, is a monster. The film's brief glimpse of heaven is like some limousine liberal's fantasy. <br/><br/>I think ""Les Miserables"" is as popular as it is for the same reason that Cinderella is so popular. When ""Les Miserable"" was a stage play, tickets were a very expensive and difficult to acquire luxury. It is ironic that a play about the wretched of the earth would be such a luxury entertainment. Why do we enjoy watching people much poorer and more desperate than we will ever be? Why do we pay for the privilege? Because we all see ourselves in Cinderella, in Jean Valjean, no matter how lucky we are. I'll certainly never stand in cold sea water with iron shackles around my wrists and neck, overseen by a cold sadist like Javert. But, along with millions of others, I saw my own struggles in Valjean, and thanked God that I didn't have it as bad as he. If Jean Valjean can go on, I can, too! <br/><br/>I wish the songs had been a tad better. There are a couple of good ones, ""I dreamed a dream"" and ""Do you hear the people sing?"" All the actors sing very well. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman sing especially well."
"ungsuok","5","92","146","25 December 2012"," I really wanted to like this...
","As a huge fan of the musical, I have been waiting with anticipation for this movie release. I just got back from the Christmas eve 10pm showing of this movie, and I must say that I am somewhat disappointed. There were some positives, but I feel it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>First the positives. There are some very strong performances here.<br/><br/><ul><li>Anne Hathaway's performance has already drawn critical acclaim, so I won't dwell on it, except to say that the acclaim is well deserved.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hugh Jackman's voice tone and interpretation of Jean Valjean is quite different from anyone before, and I found myself drawn deeply to this Jean Valjean, sympathizing with his every emotion. I thought he did a great job of switching between a rough gravelly tone to a more clean ringing falsetto depending on the emotions of the character. I do have a complaint about directorial cues on one of Jean Valjean's key numbers, but more on that below.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Eddie Redmayne as Marius gives a great performance. For the stage productions, Marius has always been one of my least favorite characters, always lacking depth with what I perceived as just immature blind infatuation for Cosette as his only emotion. In this movie, Eddie really captured each moment: his love for Cosette in the moonlight garden scene, his determination and drive for revolution, his remorse and anguish during ""Empty chairs at empty tables"" (a real tour-de-force performance). I thought he was wonderful.</li></ul><br/><br/>Also, the set/locations/scenery/costumes/make up really allow the audience to immerse into the story. I think this point is one of the greatest benefits a movie setting has over a stage production, and this movie delivers on this front. From the beautiful country settings, to the grime and grit of poverty in Montreuil and Paris, there is a strong sense of realism that you can't get in stage production (they did overdo it slightly in the sewer scene).<br/><br/>Now on to the negatives.<br/><br/>I have seen a few reviews complaining about the slow pace of the film. I thought the opposite. It felt kinda rushed. I know the stage production is 3 hours long, but I wish they hadn't sacrificed the story and proper delivery to save on run time for the movie. Some of the scene transitions are rather abrupt and leaves a sense of this being an ensemble of songs, rather than one flowing story. I'm not a purist in that I will complaint about every single change from the stage production, but some of the cuts and omissions really hurt the flow of the story and leaves some key characters and relationships woefully under-developed. Having said that, I do think one addition was brilliant: the scene with Jean Valjean singing to a sleeping Cosette in the carriage as they leave the Thenardier's inn. It really gives a great insight into the change that Jean Valjean goes through and the bond that he forms with Cosette.<br/><br/>Enjolras seems shuffled as a minor character, which is too bad as Aaron Tveit played the part with great passion when given the chance. Even though fleeting, Enjolras, Grantaire, and even Gavroche share some moments in the stage production that allows us to bond with these characters. I felt the movie marginalized each as their own without developing a bond between them.<br/><br/>Eponine also seemed to be under-developed. I can't quite place it. The individual performances were very strong, but ""On my own"" and ""A little fall of rain"" didn't quite have the same emotional impact that I thought it would. I think it was due to the lack of insight into the dynamic between Marius and Eponine. There was a lot of Eponine watching Marius fall in love with Cosette from a distance, but only one instance that I can remember of Marius unknowingly hurting Eponine during their interaction. I can think of 3 or 4 such occurrences in the stage production and really sympathizing with Eponine each time it happened. Again, subtle differences, but it really detracted from the overall story for me.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't care for Hugh Jackman's rendition of, and Tom Hooper's direction of ""Bring him home"". In the stage production, this song is very subdued with Jean Valjean singing in beautiful high falsetto while watching over a sleeping Marius. There is a beauty to its simpleness, and it is almost like a glimpse into Valjean's mind as he silently sends a prayer up to God. This movie's interpretations is much more... dynamic. Hugh Jackman delivers with a stronger force as Valjean nervously walks around the 2nd story of a building looking down on a sleeping Marius at the barricade. Certainly a very different interpretation, and it didn't work for me.<br/><br/>One last bit of negative was the casting of Russell Crowe as Javert. I am a fan of Russell Crowe, and while he is a great fit for the look and persona of Javert, I just did not feel he fit the vocal demands of the character. It prevented me from empathizing with Javert, my favorite character from the stage production.<br/><br/>With as much anticipation as I had going in, I'm afraid it was a bit of a disappointment. I really wanted to like this, but came away thinking of what could have been. Certainly a must see for all fans of the musical, but it is a shame that this movie will be the sole judgement of Les Mis for millions of viewers who may never have a chance to see the stage production."
"DoctorNordo","10","146","247","25 December 2012"," The definitive Les Miserables movie experience!
","As someone who has been burned by every single Hollywood adaptation of Les Miserables, let me categorically state that this time it was done right! Everything from the acting to the music to the sets was borderline perfect. The only thing that could possibly be considered a negative was something that was absolutely unavoidable. That is, when you are taking a novel as voluminous as Les Miserables and condensing it into a feature length movie, some things will be cut or rushed. This is no exception. The movie moves at breakneck speed. Anyone who is fond of the Broadway musical will no doubt not be bothered by it, but people new to the story or those who have only read the novel might be put off by it.<br/><br/>As far as the acting and music is concerned, I can find very little to fault. Russel Crowe was the weakest of the lot as I just didn't find his voice to be up to the task of singing some of Javert's songs (Stars immediately springs to mind). Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Samantha Barks were all especially good. The intense emotions their characters experience throughout the story are perfectly performed.<br/><br/>This naturally leads to a critique of the music. Anyone familiar with the Broadway show will undoubtedly find themselves joyously mouthing along to the familiar lyrics and might be surprised at a couple of brand new songs written specifically for the movie. Just as in the show, the music is brilliant and meshes wonderfully with the story.<br/><br/>One of the biggest treats, however, were the sets and special effects. The beauty and squalor of 19th century Paris was showcased magnificently and it really allowed you to become engrossed in story.<br/><br/>This is a movie that both fans of the novel as well as fans of the musical can both fall in love with, since even though there are some deviations from the novel this is still the closest a film version has ever come to being completely faithful to the book. Additionally, this movie is a perfect chance for those who have never read the book or haven't heard of or had a chance to see the Broadway show. I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. My only warning is to limit your fluid intake, since at 2.5+ hours your chance of encountering an overflowing bladder is a very real danger."
"ManchesterMatthew","1","565","1015","12 January 2013"," Les Pàinful
","I went to see this film as a complete Les Mis virgin, having no idea as to the storyline, and having never seen any previous production nor having read the novel.<br/><br/>But I enjoy musicals (both in the theatre and film versions) and I went with an open mind, and looking forward to seeing something a little different from the norm. Sadly, within the first few minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake, and this has become one of my most hated films of all time.<br/><br/>Indeed, I always rate films but rarely review them, but I just had to get this off my chest. Particularly because so many reviews seem to be gushing about its brilliance, and although I'm fully prepared to admit that my views are in the minority, I think it's important to air them if only in the interest of balance and representation.<br/><br/>It didn't take long to realise that every single word of the dialogue was to be 'sung'. I say 'sung' rather than sung, because it wasn't what I could really refer to as singing. Just because one woooooord of any given liiiiiine is extended like thiiiiiis, does not, in my mind, make it 'singing'. In fact, if it weren't for the extended words in nearly every sentence, the film would likely have been at least thirty minutes shorter.<br/><br/>The lack of spoken dialogue really detracted from many of the scenes. When even the most mundane of sentences has to be delivered in such a way, it becomes grating. I wouldn't have been at all surprised for someone to bellow out ""pass the saaaaaalt"". It was just awful. <br/><br/>And the repetition! I understand that chords and themes repeat throughout musicals, often linking similarities between scenes and concepts and characters. It isn't that I don't understand that. But this was too much. It was as though the same tones and flow were repeated every four lines. Every. Four. Lines. With the third or fourth wooooooords extended. Every. Single Time.<br/><br/>I'm getting wound up reliving the moment and I've waited till the following morning before doing this review in case my opinion mellowed. <br/><br/>It hasn't.<br/><br/>And the duration of the film only served to make it worse. Occasionally the film would announce via on-screen text that it was now ""8 years later"", or whatever. And I felt as though I'd been there for that entire time. In fact, it felt like longer.<br/><br/>It became one of those films which leaves you feeling physically drained from the effort of battling through it. It was that bad. It felt like I've undergone a test of endurance and although I got through it, it wasn't without mental scarring!<br/><br/>Beyond the monotony, repetition and delivery, there was the story, which (perhaps as I had no prior knowledge of the source) was nonsensical. People falling in love within a single glance, which then goes on to motivate someone else to endure warfare to carry the person, half-dead? Chasing someone for what, 17 years, because of breaking parole for a loaf of bread, which itself warranted a previous 19 years of suffering? Only to then throw yourself to your death?<br/><br/>Am I meant to believe these characters? Am I meant to care about them?<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway's deterioration from factory worker to cropped and toothless prostitute was compacted into all of 42 seconds, so when it came to her performance of I Dreamed A Dream (which was a rare highlight in the film) its impact was stunted because why should we care about this woman? She's only just been introduced to us and we know nothing about her (presumably because everyoooooone is too busy singing like thiiiiiiiis instead of actually making us caaaaaaare).<br/><br/>Yet apparently Hugh Jackman cares so much about her that he then devotes his entire life to her child? It was mentioned at the very beginning that he has a sister and a nephew of his own, why not take care of them? Or were they dead (as he went to a cross in the ground after being paroled) but if that's the case it wasn't explained well.<br/><br/>A film should be able to stand on its own two feet and not require its audience to have read the book or seen the musical. The Harry Potter books far exceed the movies, yet people can enjoy the movies on their own merit. Not so with Les Mis.<br/><br/>And the casting was bizarre as well. I don't understand why the casting was given to Hollywood actors instead of singers. Borat? Really?? And accents were flying all over the place. Early in the film, when Hugh Jackman is in the church, he suddenly sounds as though he's stepped off the first boat from Ireland, and half of the cast of jumped straight out of a Mary Poppins chalk drawing!<br/><br/>I can't find a single redeeming feature to mention about this film. Miscast. Rubbish sets (most of it looking like obvious CGI). Repetitive 'singing'. No spoken dialogue. Nonsensical plot. Ridiculous pacing. No character development or involvement. <br/><br/>Beyond doubt one of the worst films I have ever watched, and I would sooner have my teeth extracted by a French street urchin than ever have to endure this horror again."

He lives a fugitive life, complicated by his pledge to help raise the daughter of an unfortunate woman.<br/><br/>""Les Miserables"" is a wonderful film. Right from the start, it captures every viewer's hearts. It makes three hours seem like ten minutes. It is so touching and so poignant that everyone in the cinema cried like a baby. Throughout the film, the sound of tissue packets opening and closing was a permanent addition to the soundtrack. For me, I just let my t shirt be drenched in tears, as if i have had a strenuous workout. I thought the Anna Hathaway soliloquy was already with the ticket price, but masterpiece scenes like that keep on coming. I was dehydrated from all the water I lost from tears by the end of the film.<br/><br/>It's amazing how the film can take us through every emotions there is. From the relentless struggle for existence, the the uplifting revolutionary spirit, the fatherly love and the encompassing integrity of Jean.

"maestro-20","9","130","224","15 December 2012"," A superb film version of the beloved musical
","If you don't like musicals or are not a fan of the through-sung style, skip this movie. I will only irritate you (much like bombastic action films torture me).<br/><br/>But if you're a fan of Les Miserables or musicals in general, then you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>Many people have criticized Tom Hooper's direction. For me, I just think these people have no idea what Hooper is doing, and do not realize the effects of his work (with the help of Danny Cohen's marvelous cinematography). The Dutch angles work very well, especially during the Lovely Ladies sequences -- Hooper skillfully created a surrealistic, nightmarish Paris for Fantine (and the audience), making us feel queasy and uncomfortable and horrified, in some ways, for Fantine. We have to realize that this is not a videotaped version of the stage play or concert. This is a movie. Hooper said that he wanted to create an extreme/heightened realism that is on the verge of being surrealistic. I for one applaud his choice and I think it works beautifully for the movie.<br/><br/>Same with the close-ups. They created the kind of intimacy you won't get on stage, and also provided the opportunities for the actors to do their work. The result is amazingly personal, intense. Obviously it works better for some actors than others (that's why we're thinking of giving Anne Hathaway the Oscar, not Amanda Seyfried), but over all, it's a great cinematic choice -- together with live recording... it's emotionally powerful.<br/><br/>I do have some gripes: certain hand-held camera shots could have been avoided or stabilized -- there is really no need for them. The barricade scenes can be somewhat chaotic and rushed. Unfortunately Hooper has to work in the confine of the musical structure, and the story is already almost 3 hours long. Also, they had to cut or shorten some songs to fit the time frame - to those who have seen the show 30 times, it could be unsettling.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent. Hugh Jackman carries most of the movie with dignity and amazing versatility. He may not be the best singer in the world to play Valjean, but he IS Valjean on screen -- his voice is characterized to fit Valjean perfectly. His ""What Have I Done"" is a revelation of what his song-and-dance man who is best known for Wolverine can do.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway deserves all the accolades she is getting. Her ""I Dream a Dream"" will become the de facto performance for those who will play Fantine in the future.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is a surprise -- I know the actor can act, but I had no idea that he could sing so well. And that he could sing and act at the same time with such grace and charm. It's not an easy thing to accomplish.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit have done Les Miserables on stage before, and they are excellent in the film. Many stage actors can't transition to the screen, but these two have succeeded (with a lot hard work, no doubt).<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried is one of the weakest links in the movie. She is, of course, lovely as the adult Cosette (Isabelle Allen is excellent as young Cosette), even though the part is underwritten (in the film or on stage). Her singing voice is okay, but not as strong as expected, and I find her performance somewhat one dimensional. But she and Redmayne have great chemistry together, and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe also is the weak link. He is a good actor and I think he does his best with this role. But his rock-opera voice is jarringly different from the rest and he just stands out like a sore thumb. However, in the course of the movie he grew on me. In his final scenes I can see the great acting (it's all in the eyes, people!). So while I can't say he's the best Javert ever, I'll give him a pass.<br/><br/>The supporting cast and background actors are all excellent.<br/><br/>The production is rich and wonderful with great sets, great cinematography, great costumes. <br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. I haven't seen one single film this year that is ""perfect."" I don't think that exists. At the end of the day (pun intended), Les Miserables is all about the music, the characters, and the emotions, and this film delivers. I expect many award nominations for this film."

","As a fan of the musical, I had not to be disappointed with this adaptation and I wasn't! I had the opportunity of watching it at the premiere in Leicester Square in London, with all the huge actors, the director, musical creator's, etc. <br/><br/>It was really exciting, the actors sing better than I expected, and all the photography added to the musical perfectly complete it for an unforgettable experience. <br/><br/>I can't tell anything bad. Anne Hathaway is very good, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen or Hugh Jackman. The musical is fantastic. The movie: terrific!"
"ibrankovic80","1","189","342","4 February 2013"," Les Insufferables
","I am quite frankly flabbergasted at the amount of positive reviews by viewers and professional critics given to this movie. I do not remember the last time that an audio-visual experience inflicted me with so much pain, both mentally and physically. I think my theatre seat still has indentations from me clutching the chair frantically throughout the movie. I felt like the Clockwork Orange protagonist when he's tied down to a chair and fed those nauseating stimuli (the main difference being that he got to listen to some quality music in the process). It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot of hubris in my time.<br/><br/>The review by MouthyMatthew summarises it the best. Over the top. Chords and themes excruciatingly repetitive (How possibly wouldn't they be? I mean, every line in a 159 minute movie has been ""sung"", down to the most banal mundane statement you can imagine.). The movie successfully drains your life energy as it progresses, since you have to employ a supernatural effort to stick with the characters' lines. <br/><br/>What would be a series of seemingly important storyline details ends up receiving a very cursory treatment. For instance, Fantine's tragic life trajectory. Furthermore, why on earth would they hire Hollywood bigshots with a singing talent of a sexually frustrated walrus to play these parts?? And the accents, oh, for the love of god. What the hell? Overall impression: laughably sappy (yet unconvincing) and above all insufferable.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, I think people should not see this movie if they have not been exposed to the story earlier, by reading the book or seeing a good musical production of it. I truly hate that this will be my first impression of both the story and the characters, the one that I will always be stuck with."
"The-Sarkologist","8","12","17","20 January 2013"," I want to go to London and see this live on stage!
","This is the first time that I have actually seen this story and to put it bluntly, it simply blew my mind, right to the point that as I am writing this I am listening to the songs on You-Tube. The one thing that unfortunately drags this particular movie down (and pretty much everything else about this film is absolutely spectacular) is Sacha Baron Cohen. Every scene in which he was in was painful (and maybe that is still a hangover from Borat) and as far as I am concerned, he completely butchered 'Master of the House' (though it was redeemed with 'oohh Santa!', if you have seen the film you will know what I mean).<br/><br/>Basically the story is about grace and how one man responds to grace. Many times I have heard pastors use this story to describe grace (and they namely refer to the scene where the bishop responds to Valjean's theft of the silverware with the statement that it was gift, and the only problem was that he left too early because he forgot to take the candle sticks). If it be only that scene that made this story stand out then that would be enough, but it goes much further because the whole theme of the story is about how Valjean responds to this act of grace in that he completely turns his life around and becomes a well respected citizen.<br/><br/>Still, believe it or not, there is even more. This story is almost Shakespearian in scope in that there are at least three or four plots intermeshed into the story (with the main plot being the redemption of Valjean). For instance, we have a love story, a story of self sacrifice, an exploration of the life of the peasant in early 19th century France, a failed revolution, and of course, the dogged pursuit of Valjean by his nemesis Javert.<br/><br/>I remember making a comment about Cohen on a facebook entry and a friend of mine responded by making a snide comment about Russell Crowe singing, and maybe that tarnished the film a bit, but after seeing it, I don't think Crowe did a bad job at all, and if fact I think he took up the challenge and succeeded with flying colours. In fact, by the end of the movie I had no problem with Russell Crowe playing a major role at all. As for Hugh 'Wolverine show us your claws' Jackman, well, we all know that he can sing and that he has starred in musicals previously, and as the main character, he was absolutely superb."

","I confess that I got surprised in the first 15 minutes of the movie, when at no time did the actors stop singing for ""normal lines"", I had never seen a movie with that format.<br/><br/>So I say that the feature film is surprisingly good, even if it seems strange at first.<br/><br/>In at least three moments in the story I really was prone to crying (Anne Hathaway simply destroys her role, even though she appears a little bit lightly) and this is something that does not happen often when I watch movies.<br/><br/>The plot brings a sad story that at the same time criticizes ancient times of humanity, but can also be understood as a parallel with the world today.<br/><br/>The actors are all incredibly good in their roles, both in acting and singing. Maybe my only problem with the film is its duration, in several moments I stopped to look at how much time was left to finish, not enough to be annoying, but if I had a half hour more it could be more easily accessible."

","Going into Les Miserables I was a huge fan of the long running stage show. Going in I didn't know what to expect? From the opening shot of the French flag under water. The camera shoots from the water to the ear popping sound of the orchestra. The convicts are pulling ships into the shore. It truly is amazing effects and the sound is overwhelming. The story of Les Mis is about Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) prisoner 24601 as he is given his yellow ticket of leave by the Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) , he becomes a better man and becomes a Mayor. When Fantine (Anne Hathaway) is dying and her daughter is in need of a carer, Valjean says he'll raise the child. Our movie is set around these characters. Hugh Jackman- Superb as our lead with a great voice as well.Oscar worthy performances Anne Hathaway- A certain winner for best supporting actress, she brought me to tears. Russell Crowe- his acting is splendid. His singing not so much but the more I hear his voice the more I begin to like! Eddie Raymane- he's the big surprise for me. He ails every note as our young boy searching for love. Amanda Seyfried- though she wasn't in much her voice was mouth droppingly beautiful. Cohen and Bonham Carter- hilarious! Nothing else to say. Samantha Barks- she has the best voice and has amazing talent for someone unknown to the film world. For people to know... Les Miserables is 100% singing s you've been warned. Yes some might not like it and some will love it! For me I loved it. It was a tear jerking, heart racing at times picture with amazing sets. Brilliant Acting also! Anne Hathaway is the high point of the movie. It starts high, then goes amazing to dull and boring to comic relief to romance to gut wrenching action! Les Miserables it's self for me...it's one of the years best!"
"aharmas","2","89","169","12 January 2013"," Les Horribles
","I went into this film with high hopes since the cast has some very talented actors, and then I remember it was a musical, and most of these people can't sing. ""Phantom of the Opera"" had a similar problem with its lead performer; however the leading lady was superb, and the direction quite spectacular, and it didn't hurt that the songs were good. That's not the case with this big, horrible mess.<br/><br/>In addition to being one of the most boring movies ever made, there is very little to like beside some sets and costumes, and the fact that Hugh Jackman can hold a note for almost a minute. Other than that, Hathaway overacts, Crowe looks disturbed most of the film and appears to be missing something. I can't even find words to describe the emotions I discovered with Helena and Sasha. They finally met their match. For years, these two have survived a few cinematic bombs, but this movie is the equivalent of the Black Plague... Very little is left standing.<br/><br/>With a camera that seems to be on some type of epileptic seizure, a very truncated story line, and one of the most incredibly unappealing and forgettable song scores of the last hundred years, it's hard to enjoy something that calls itself a musical, but doesn't quite have anything remotely close to a melody. For more than two hours, one hears something akin to the scratching of nails on a blackboard, and why does everyone wear so much rouge? A few years ago the director gathered some of the best British and Australian talent and won a Best Picture Oscar with a very weak film. This type the trick doesn't work because the material and the direction are outstandingly weak.<br/><br/>If the musical genre doesn't suffer a painful death after this, nothing will be able to kill it. If Jackman's character got 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread, I can't even imagine what a judge would give the producers and directors for creating this tuneless torture. Fantine was lucky to meet her maker in the first 20 minutes... We had to endure 2.5 hours of this horrible experience."
"sylogician","2","94","180","22 December 2012"," Umm... How did THAT happen?
","Among the worst directed big budget features in recent years, Les Miserables suffers from so many problems it's hard to choose where to begin.<br/><br/>I suppose the most annoying item is the hand-held camera shoved up the actors' noses. This unfortunate choice simultaneously throws every performance into melodramatic overdrive while also insuring the audience a nauseatingly claustrophobic roller coaster ride inches from the casts' lens-distorted features.<br/><br/>Next up would have to be the uneven performances within the musical numbers. This is not a critique of the actors or their singing, but of the director's choice to not guide them toward performances scaled for the shots. There's a difference between belting out a musical show-tune to the back row or coming in on a close up to capture the moment which requires a quieter more internal thought. And if you're going to play those moments very wide or very close, hone the performance to suit the choice. Too often the performance is out of sync with the shot.<br/><br/>Next, focus. In today's world of monitors, DITs and playback, there is no excuse for so much of this film to be out of focus. I don't care if your depth of field is two millimeters. Go back and get it right or pump some more light on the subject and find a depth of field and lens your AC is comfortable with.<br/><br/>Then there are creative choices like playing Lovely Ladies strictly for the ugliness of the nineteenth century gutter it's set in and Master of the House with so little energy that not even SB Cohen can elevate it.<br/><br/>I am not sure what film all those ten star reviews on this IMDb page are for. I can only hope that they were written by people who loved the musical and lived in hope that the film would live up to its legacy, but haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>As for me, I have seen it and am bitterly disappointed."

Sorry for the money.<br/><br/>I do not know if my expectations are too high (being myself a musician) but I sort of think that what a musical is all about is singing. Acting is important, costumes can be nice and it does not hurt if the takes are nice too. However, hence the word MUSICal, it's all about music, and Les Miserables are simply miserable in this respect. The main two actors (Jackman and Craw) are undoubtedly very good actors but have no idea how to sing; They are incapable of singing a straight note and it is obvious that they never had any real lessons except probably at acting school (as usual with these cases a month's coaching before the shooting is not enough - all professional e.g. Broadway singers who suffer for years are not stupid, they do it for a reason). Had they not been famous, everyone would laugh.<br/><br/>Whoever does not believe me simply please buy the CD with some proper cast (for instance Michael Ball or Anthony Warlow).<br/><br/>If one can tolerate the insufferable singing, I admit that the rest is excellent. The acting is superb, the takes breathtaking, the costumes and sets fantastic, and the emotions overwhelming. If....<br/><br/>I take away five stars for the awful music and give full credit to the rest. However, music is in my opinion half the job, and in this case half a job very badly done."
"zeekwunlau","9","3","3","8 April 2020"," People should be kind
","This movie is the happiest thing I have seen this year.
All those places have its ugly side, which we despise; at the same time, it also has its outstanding side, which we respect.
It is love and redemption.
The summaries of all the commandments are love, and those who love others will have the law complete, and love can cover up many sins.
In the two and a half hours of epic epic, I shed tears heartily, God's injustice to Jean Valjean's youth, and Jean Valjean's confession to God. Fantin degenerates step by step under the pressure of life, and the explosion of Anne's acting makes me cry without restriction. How tragic the world is, the kindness that is crushed on the streets of society can't breathe, and it can barely be supported, but only the love for the loved one in the heart.
The injustice of fate, in this huge epic, only hope to sigh the savior and hero.
However, redemption itself will redeem each other, God redeems the priest, the priest redeems Valjean, Valjean redeems Fantine, Cosette, Marius, and even his righteous enemy, Javert.
Jean Valjean, with a kind heart, finally redeemed himself. Although his inner conscience will make people haggard, it will still make you permanently radiate humanitarian charm and make people admire.
The love in it also impressed me. The dialogue in the rain really came from three people. The heroic sacrifice in the rain is the one who ca n't wait for death to find company. Any love falls in love at first sight.
Poor and fragile in front of me, but this time it was right.
Too many occasions cater to the characteristics of musicals. I have been enjoying it for a long time, and I am hungry and thirsty.
I love every character in this movie, even if there are dirty liars, all this is epic."

Listening to Wolverine, whom I like, sing for three hours was painful. Sorry, but Hugh Jackman was terribly miscast. Anne Hathaway was decent, but she cannot sing either. The ONLY really good performance in this movie was the child, who by the way comes from the London Stage production of Oliver. It showed. He could sing. He had talent. Otherwise this was an assembly of basically TV actors and a couple rock star types. The real tragedy of this movie is that the people who could have done it justice, those with musical stage capability, never got the chance to make the kind of money Hugh Jackman, et. al pulled down for this.<br/><br/>The other terrible thing was the closeups. A few would have been artistically interesting.

These are supposed to be real people with real issues (somewhat extreme but nevertheless). While it was difficult at times to understand Russell Crowe I commend him for taking on a role that he has not been trained for. Hugh Jackman was outstanding which makes sense given that he has performed on Broadway in the past. Anne Hathaway destroyed me in the final scene! She was brilliant, heart-retching and devastating all at once! While I don't know if someone who is too dense to understand what opera is will enjoy this movie; I think it's wonderfully done in all aspects.

I could not say enough good things about this production. The performers were excellent, the sets and effects were great and the direction kept things moving. If this were on the stage Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream' would have stopped the show... I wanted to stand a cheer.

No wonder the entire thing was shot in a series of nauseating close-ups. I like Hugh Jackman but If this is the performance of a lifetime he may need a couple more lifetimes to make up for it. He suffered from frame one to the dismal end and so did the audience. Worse was Russell Crowe who managed to look constipated for the entire film. And newsflash: He can't sing! Anne Hathaway can sing but she can't act. Why did they bother hiring Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen? They did nothing but mug in ugly costumes and wigs. Maybe the director thought it was a remake of Sweeney Todd? Three perfumers stood out: Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Samantha Barks as Eponine and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. Poor Amanda Seyfried.

","This movie is an excellent attempt to capture Les Mis on film which mostly succeeds.<br/><br/>I've read many of the reviews posted on this site and firstly would like to clear up a few inaccuracies. We Americans are so insular, aren't we? We think it's a Hollywood movie based on a Broadway show set during the French Revolution. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Actually, it's a British production made in London based on the hit West End show (which later transferred to 42 countries - one of which was the USA). It's not even set during the French Revolution! European history isn't our thing, right? The storming of the Bastille, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette etc...that was the French Revolution and it happened in 1789....the rebellion/ uprising scenes in the movie are set during protests in the 1830s.<br/><br/>A reviewer bemoaned the fact that most people on screen sing/ speak in English/ cockney accents. Errrr....that's the way many of the locals in London talk. Someone else suggested they should have French accents. Oh puhleeeease.....where's the realism if everyone has phony accents that sound like Inspector Clouseau?! Street urchins using their genuine London accents sounds much more realistic.<br/><br/>OK, now for my review proper.<br/><br/>I loved the movie. Having seen the London stage production 3 times and listened to the CD hundreds of times I had high expectations. Anne Hathaway as Fantine steals the show - I Dreamed a Dream is one of the greatest tear-jerkers ever written, and she does it justice. WOW! Speechless. Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe....all great. Crowe's Javert is most convincing, and his singing isn't nearly as bad as I had expected after reviewing some critical reviews. Sets, costumes, sound, direction...all top notch. <br/><br/>The big disappointment is Sacha Saron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thennadiers....they just didn't tick the right boxes for me. Master of the House is a bit flat. <br/><br/>The overall movie experience is an emotional roller-coaster - if you don't shed a tear at the end you must have a heart of stone."
"Counthaku","8","10","15","25 December 2012"," Solid overall, with some hard-hitting sequences
","Having never seen the stage version of Les Miserables and having read limited reviews of the film, I honestly didn't know what to expect from Tom Hooper's Les Miserables. After experiencing the film earlier today, I can say it was a tremendous experience.<br/><br/>I felt the first thirty minutes or so were the strongest of the entire film, plunging us into the despair and conflicts of various characters with adroit narrative thrust so that not a moment feels wasted or redundant. Two of the three (in my opinion) gut-wrenching musical numbers come in this section- Anne Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" (which, if I recall correctly, was filmed largely in a single take) and Hugh Jackman's ""Who Am I?"". I can only speculate but, compared to the stage version, being able to take in every facial nuance in the film version seems to make the moments of crescendo and soaring strings pack so much more of an emotional punch. Both Hathaway and Jackman also deliver top-notch performances, and it's hard to imagine anyone else fitting the role of Valjean as well as Jackman. <br/><br/>Thematically, the film also shines in this section. Here we are introduced to the major theme of forgiveness for the first time, through Fantine we tap into maternal bonds as well as disillusionment, and Valjean's struggles explore the conflict between not only public and private selves but also reconciling our own personal interests with what is morally correct.<br/><br/>It seemed curious to me that the bleakest moments of the film (at least for me) came at the beginning, which made it impossible for the film to regain that same sense of gravitas as the story progressed. While the remainder of the film was certainly entertaining, it felt both less emotionally involving and less taut than the beginning.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen provided some much appreciated comic relief, but their antics seemed oddly out of place in this film at times, and often left me feeling as though I were watching Sweeney Todd again. Russell Crowe, while certainly no vocal powerhouse, did a fine job as Javert, although I found his final number to be oddly anti-climactic. The younger actors gave fine performances as well, with Samantha Barks demonstrating the most potential and Eddie Redmayne surprisingly delivering the final gut-wrenching number, ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" The thematic exploration of the rise and fall of idealism makes this sequence especially poignant.<br/><br/>Artistically, Les Miserables is a feast. The production design is top-notch, with meticulously crafted sets and props. Makeup and costumes are definitely noteworthy as well. Many of the shots of Paris have an artificially beautiful aesthetic to them, and every crane shot adds a sense of beauty and scope to the piece. Editorially, the film makes takes advantage of cuts to characters in different locations or concurrent events which would not have been possible in the stage version of Les Mis.<br/><br/>One minor complaint from a filmmaking perspective was cinematographer Danny Cohen's method of framing characters. Conventional cinematography typically frames actors so that their faces are demarcating either the left or right third of the screen, with the camera positioned so that their subjects are turned towards the remaining two thirds of the screen. In Les Miserables (though thankfully not to the same extent as in The King's Speech), a few times the characters are positioned so that they are facing the other direction- the edge of the screen. Though I imagine the filmmakers were attempting to add visual flourish to the film, I found this technique oddly jarring, drawing me out of the film and making me conscious I was watching a movie.<br/><br/>The film does regain some levity in its rousing finale, which ties the film together in plot, theme, and song. Despite the minor issues I had with the film, I found it to be a hard-hitting and rousing work of art. I could probably sum it up best by noting that this is the first movie I've been to where even old men were wiping their teary eyes by the time the credits rolled."

However I don't do Lloyd-Webber. And now I don't do Schonberg/Boublil either.<br/><br/>This film is truly, hideously awful.<br/><br/>French TV is awash with programmes where earnest looking pseuds sit round a table for hour after endless hour, discussing the most arcane subject matter while an audience of bored people watch on, trying to look as if they are enjoying themselves. Well this film has that quality in spades. It drones on and on and on and on and on....relentlessly. I came out physically drained.<br/><br/>Its interesting to note that many of the good reviews this has received are from Les Mis nutjobs, who stalk the production like emotional hobbits. Ignore them, they are lying through their teeth. <br/><br/>""I cried all the way through""...""I cried in the car park""...are these the thoughts of a balanced grown-up I ask you? <br/><br/>I would say, though, that I suspect it makes an OK stage show. I've seen excerpts and it gets by, just. But there are probably only two OK tunes in the whole piece; the rest are the stage equivalent of a whistling milkman...that is to say, tuneless and unidentifiable.<br/><br/>Watching Crowe sing in this is worse than cringe-inducing; his voice is just awful. Jackman is far far worse. The girls get by vocally - just.<br/><br/>And thats the sad thing, because its a talented cast and the acting element of it is actually extremely good. Had it been a film of Victor Hugo's book it would have been absolutely outstanding..........but they tried to sing and it all went down the toilet. I firmly believe that, had they used proper singers instead of these am-dram luvvies, it might have stood a chance. It is, after all, supposed to be a musical, not a film with actors trying and failing to carry a tune (although I use that term in the loosest sense here).<br/><br/>You should go and see it, even if only to share my pain, but take a book to read because at nearly three hours, its two hours too long IMNVHO."

The sets are vast but simplistic, relating to the stage play.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman played a blinding role, as did Anne Hathaway and Amanda Siegfried. Russell Crowe played a great 'baddie' but his signing wasn't really the highlight of his role.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were both excellent for the roles they played of the innkeeper and his wife, the lightness in the darkness of the film, very funny.<br/><br/>Without giving away and spoilers, its difficult to describe how truly emotionally charged the film is, but as soon as the haunting music and chilling lyrics start, you do get a rush of pure sadness in places. So moving.<br/><br/>You know a film is good when the cinema audience give a round of applause at the end, and they did.<br/><br/>A must see film, at the cinema, for the pure spectacle and sound track."
"gardoma","5","44","85","26 December 2012"," Beautiful Musical Turned into a Boring TV Special
","As I was a kid growing up in Italy, I remember when the national TV channels broadcast classical operas. Even as a kid, I could understand the efforts of the directors who had to work with what they had---editing in real time live stage actors. Obviously, movie directors do not have the limitation--- they can edit, dub, sync, use CGI, and move their cameras at will, in harmony or in counterpoint to the music. So, I was utterly disappointed when I saw that Tom Hooper did not achieve anything better than the old-timey Italian TV directors could do with staged opera.<br/><br/>That is even more surprising because Hooper is working on Les Miserables---the longest-running, most beloved musical of all time. Les Mis contains some of the most beautiful, moving, and powerful pieces of music ever written. And its music is layered on one of the best and richest novel plots. <br/><br/>With such a rich material available, Tom Hopper makes the odd decision in concentrating all of his efforts in beautifully rich scenarios and CGI reconstructions of Paris (one of which is bizarrely out of perspective), and filming every single solo as a more-or-less single shot of the close-up of the singer. With Anne Hathaway's performance, it kind of works, but it fails with everybody else. In fact, I found that this choice creates two kinds of problems. First, it creates an uncanny contrast between the intensity of the performance (strengthened by the close-ups) and the fact that, well, the characters are SINGING, even when dying. Somehow, forcing the intensity of the acting breaks the spell instead of strengthening it. <br/><br/>Second, and most importantly, there is an unresolved tension between the music and the immobility of the camera. the music drives the feelings, and invites motion and changes. You want the camera to roll and open spaces, and, instead, you find yourself still staring at Hugh Jackman's wrinkles. One might say that this is some kind of ascetic directorial decision, but no---when the characters are not singing Tom Hooper abuses impossible camera work that zooms in and out at impossible distances, from the detail of a face to bird's eye views of Paris. So the reason for the poor filming of singing actors must lay somewhere else. Maybe the root of these problems is Hooper's much celebrated choice of having the actors sing in real-time. But, again, why was decision made in the first place? Since it causes problems in the final result, I see no point in recording the actors while singing live--- if not for bragging about it later on.<br/><br/>So, in summary, the movie was disappointing. And good performances (or even great performances) cannot save a weak directorial work that fails to shape the richness of the story and the music. If the director was someone like the energetic Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge! and Ballroom), we could have had a real movie, if not a masterpiece. Instead, we got an expensive TV Christmas special."
"lenamariapersson91","Null","21","37","25 December 2012"," If you don't compare it to the theatre production, you will fall in love with this movie!!
","Yes, I love the musical, yes I was singing along to the entire movie in my head and yes it is different from the west end/Broadway show but that by no means takes away from the brilliance of this movie. <br/><br/>I don't understand all these negative reviews about it not being the same as the theatre version, obviously its not the same, this is a movie not a theatre production. Complaints about the singing? What is there to complain about!? Every actor made you believe the heartbreak, poverty, grief, jealousy that they were feeling. I was drawn in to every note that came out of their mouths whether it was bellowed out or whispered. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is phenomenal, if he does not win an Oscar I will be gutted for him. His acting exceeds him in his portrayal of Jean Valjean. His final scene with Anne Hathaway blew me away and I could not stop sobbing. Every moment was believable. I loved how he changed his voice according to his character's aging. Jackman is amazing in all his films but Les Miserables is his best to date easily. <br/><br/>There has been a lot of hype about Anne Hathaway's Fantine and she did not disappoint. Her 'I dreamed a dream' had the whole audience sobbing, including myself. <br/><br/>Apart from the obvious candidates of Jackman and Hathaway I thought the true stars who have been under-rated and were spectacular are Eddie Redmayne as Marius and Aaron Tveit as Enjolras. Ramin Karimloo's Enjolras in the 25th anniversary for me was unbeatable but Tveit's performance topped it. Black and Red was just wow, Redmayne and Tveit made a wonderful duo and I was weeping at Enjolra's death which brings me onto Redmayne's performance. I thought he nailed this role, he was the Marius that I had in my head and I can't even begin to explain how i felt when he sang 'Empty Chairs and Empty Tables' the tears just weren't stopping, he was amazing! His interaction with Samantha Barks was brilliant and he was just the perfect gentleman during her death scene. I think a lot of us girls have been Eponine at some point in our lives and Barks portrayed that heartbreak wonderfully. <br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were brilliant as the Thenardiers and all the horrible comments about Russel Crowe are unjustifiable. He was a great Javert. Yes his voice may not match that of those who have played the part before him but he made up for it in his acting. 'Stars' was beautiful and his suicide was heartbreaking. <br/><br/>I can honestly not critisise a single thing about this movie. Cast, editing, singing, make-up, costumes just everything was brilliant. The movie has had a lot of hype but as a theatre and film lover I can honestly say you will not be disappointed. As long as you don't make the mistake of comparing it to the west end/Broadway productions too much you will fall in love with this movie as much as I did! ENJOY!"

","I watched this movie three nights ago and I'm generally never a big fan of musicals however considering reading many positive reviews about this movie, I decided to give it a try and was hoping that it could change my perspective. It unfortunately was very disappointing and after almost three hours of singing, I had enough. These songs were done by actors who clearly did not have any experience and training in singing. Even simple dialogues were in songs which were very irritating considering the fact that the writer had obviously aimed for a 100% musical without any normal dialogue. It seems like a cheaply made movie consisting mostly of only a few stages which is repeated throughout the whole movie. The first scene was very eye-catching which seemed to have been designed to prevent further disappointment. Even though the theatre had assigned the largest screen to this movie but it never really helped to drive my enthusiasm. The settings were always too dark and depressing. I do not recommend this movie to anyone."
"ginoc009","8","16","27","25 December 2012"," Terrific!
","I read a lot of reviews so I expected Les Miserables to fall short of expectations, but I really enjoyed the film version. Better yet, it captured my imagination where I wanted to read more on the making of it, casting choices, etc. A lot of critics are harping on the close ups, but why else would one adapt a theatrical production into a movie unless you wanted to utilize the advantages of cinema? No, it doesn't dwell on sweeping vistas, but vistas are there as throwaways. Probably because they're CGI and look fake anyway, Mr. Hooper chose not to dwell on them. What I appreciated was the intimacy of the songs and the emotional honesty in their delivery.<br/><br/>Another critique I read was the film revels in ugliness. Um. You mean like the novel? It's increasingly irritating to read film criticism from people who have neither interest or experience with the subject matter. As a filmed musical version of Les Miserables, it's amazingly good. I slogged through the book back in the day, right after I bought the London Cast Soundtrack of the play and grim, harsh reality is what Victor Hugo was going for. (That, and endless explorations on what it is to rebel.) To the film's credit, Fantine doesn't get her two front teeth pulled out. That would've been hard to take, watching her sing ""I Dreamed a Dream"" with gaps in her grill.<br/><br/>Overall, I agreed with Director Tom Hooper's choices. I always thought a film version of ""I Dreamed A Dream"" would have flashbacks of a sunny country side and any other images about idyllic love, instead Mr. Hooper stays close on Anne Hathaway's beautiful, heartfelt rendition of the song and it nearly moved me to tears. I read a number of reviews criticizing Russell Crowe's singing and while he may not be Pavarotti, he did what any actor has to do if they don't have the voice of an angel: He sells the songs. Of all the Javerts I've seen captured on film, (Anthony Perkins, Geoffrey Rush, Mr. Crowe) I believed his the most. (Geoffrey Rush seemed like he should just take Valjean out for a beer.) Javert is a strange character. You have to believe that he's so obsessed with Justice and the law that he'll take his own life when his meaning of it unravels. Russell Crowe does all the work in his eyes not in his voice. I thought he was amazingly good. And I appreciated Tom Hooper's choice of having Javert flirting with death while he sings Stars, foreshadowing the way he will meet his demise.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman did solid work as Jean Valjean, but he unfortunately, fell short on ""Bring Him Home,"" which of course is Valjean's and (possibly the play's) showstopper, he got a little pitchy and cracky and didn't bring the tears. For that reason I give the film 8 instead of 10 stars.<br/><br/>But aside from that, it's a stirring, rousing, clap-at-the-end-of nearly-every scene Film musical."

","Epic, limb-numbing musical-infused version could possibly be the biggest turkey I've seen this side of Christmas (it opened here on Boxing day so the analogy is relevant). <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman seems like a tremendous stage actor, full of the exuberance and intensity needed for that medium, but for film, he's consistently over-wrought (in my opinion). Often his portrayal fails to convince me, his expression becomes 'comfortable' looking, failing to exude that sense of despondency that Jean Valjean experiences throughout his life, the subject of the ruthless tyrant Javert's (Crowe) relentless pursuit and character assassination.<br/><br/>Big Russ actually seems restrained, almost pensive in some respects and I was glad to see the make-up crew didn't give him a Bonaparte hair-do; Helena Bonham-Carter's, on the other hand, has the look of an electrified troll doll - not to take away from her talents as a thespian, but the look was truly maniacal.<br/><br/>I reserve my most ardent criticism for Anne Hathaway. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" suited her style, whereas she doesn't seem ""mature"" enough for this role, she always looks adolescent, her porcelain skin defying the rigours of her character's desperate predicament.<br/><br/>If perchance you're a fan of the epic film-musical set to battle hymns, then this version of ""Les Mis"" might pique your interest once more. For me, I'm content to stick with Richard Jordan's more inspired Jean Valjean from the seventies."

Faces and bodies filling the screen top to bottom. No depth, little screen context. And actors who cannot sing.<br/><br/>The CGR at the start of the film is ridiculous. Totally unrealistic. And the idea ludicrous. Nobody pulls a ship into a dry dock in the midst of a storm when it is listing far to a side.<br/><br/>""I Dreamed a Dream"" is a beautiful song and sung well, with lots of emotion. But who needs a face that big singing it with such a big body that every spot on her skin is like a blob. Instead of featuring the negatives (scraped skin, bloody cuts, ragged and dirty hair), why not pull back so we see the scene.<br/><br/>And the music continues in the current trend of pound on the instruments. Make is noisy. Get the deep base so lound it shake the seat. Why? Fit the music to the movie please.<br/><br/>I think it is sad that big names, big budgets and a a beautiful story mean good reviews and awards even when the movie is second rate."

The 'sung- through' style of 'singing' any dialog between the characters was, uh, agonizing to sit through. Of the main characters only Hathaway and Seyfried could hold a note; Jackman and Crowe should really, and I mean really, never appear in a musical again. Another disconcerting thing was the character Gavroche, the little urchin kid, who spoke and sang with an extreme English Cockney accent. Really? If they needed a kid with an accent are you telling me that the producers couldn't find a kid, any kid, with an accent similar to the other actors/actresses in the film, or, hell, maybe a French accent??

"The_Film_Cricket","4","35","68","17 December 2012"," Tom Hooper got it right, this is a very good movie.
","To even attempt a movie version of the musical ""Les Misérables"" may be an act of insanity. There are few musical productions more beloved or more memorized, and so the end result is either going to be success or a colossal failure. Seeing the finished product, it can be confidently said that director Tom Hooper, brings together a full-blooded production that is not shy. He pulls out all the stops, takes no prisoners and creates a big, lavish, garish, but always entertaining adaptation of a musical that leaves subtlety smoldering in the dust. Is it sad? Is it melancholy? Is it full of grimness and death? You bet, but hey, it's Les Misérables.<br/><br/>The story, for the uninitiated, begins in 1815 on the day that Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is to be paroled after serving 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread. By law of the land, he is to be on parole for the rest of his natural life. By law of the destiny, Valjean finds his place in the eyes of God after being shown kindness by a priest. Frustrated with the tyranny of his bondage, Valjean tears up his parole notice and goes on the lam. He knows that the stone-hearted Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) will never give up searching for him, but he doesn't know that this defiant gesture will change the fate of both men.<br/><br/>Years later, we catch up with Valjean who has taken the assumed name Monsieur Madeleine and is running a factory that makes rosaries. Working in the factory is the sad-eyed Fantine (Anne Hathaway) who is working to feed her illegitimate daughter. A mishap reveals her shame and she is thrown out in the street by the shop foreman. A whim of destiny keeps Valjean just out of earshot of what has happened to the young woman, who is eventually forced into prostitution. By an act of kindness, Valjean finds himself adopting Fantine's daughter Cosette (played as a child by Isabelle Allen and as an adult by Amanda Seyfried). This will be the pattern of Valjean's life. Once the priest shows him kindness, it opens a door in his heart and he finds that the kindness that he shows to others comes back to him when he needs it most. The pattern of the story is centered on two separate figures, Valjean who sees kindness as a balance to the natural order, and Javert who is blinded by his devotion to duty. Their duality is seen appropriately against the backdrop of Paris'1832 June Rebellion in which angry citizens rise up against the French army.<br/><br/>Of course, all the elements of the story are told through music – non-stop music. Even the speech is a form of talk-singing and Hooper was smart to cast well-known actors who can actually sing. Jackman, of course, is a Tony Award winner for ""The Boy from Oz"" and imbues Valjean with a kind of good-heartedness that comes from within. Russell Crowe is less schooled but has been in music since 1980. Amanda Seyfried as Cosette has a bird-like lilt to her brief musical interludes. Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter provide the much needed comic relief as the greedy Monsieur and Madame Thénardier. Also, along the edges of the film, is an unforgettable performance by 22 year-old Samantha Barks who has been in the stage production. She plays the sad-eyed Eponine, the Thénardier's daughter who gets caught up in the rebellion.<br/><br/>They are all wonderful, but no one can outclass Anne Hathaway who, with limited screen time, brings to light the disparity of being a poor woman in 19th century France. Cast out in the street for the crime of having a child out of wedlock, she is forced to sell her hair before being forced into prostitution. There, amid the squalid Hell, that is the den of the hopeless and the wretched she emotes the power of Schönberg's ""I Dreamed a Dream""; of a life that now feeds her broken promises and poisoned dreams. For six unbroken, unforgettable minutes, Tom Hooper's camera holds steady on her withered face as she cries out for the once-golden promise of a life that has crumbled . Hathaway has always been a good actress but here she reveals a depth and a range that are beyond anything we ever expected. It's a revelation.<br/><br/>That moment is a showstopper, but the rest of the production never slouches either. You walk in asking whether director Tom Hooper scored a masterwork, or a sour note? The answer to that question may rest with you. Your enjoyment may depend on your personal history with this production. What can be confidently reported is that this is probably the best adaptation of this musical that one could hope for outside of a concert hall. It is rousing, beautifully mounted and wonderfully well-acted production that entertains and does the job quite well."

","Review of the soundtrack of Les Misérables film form iTunes Les Misérables (Highlights From the Motion Picture Soundtrack)<br/><br/>As I have not seen the film I thought I would buy the soundtrack that is now on sale as a taster of things to come. I was quite excited and rather looking forward to this sound track and the seeing the film that we had all awaited for so long. After listening to this soundtrack I have to report the following, sadly.<br/><br/>Listening to the soundtrack is rather like spending a few hours at an all inclusive holiday at Auswitch concentration camp with all the joys that would bring one. It was simply dreadful.<br/><br/>It must have taken a great deal of care and effort to seemingly ruin one of the worlds greatest musicals by simply casting people with weak and utterly uninteresting singing voices that are totally unsuitable for the parts that we all love and cherish. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has a slightly pleasant singing voice in a smokey drunken karaoke way but possess a very weak voice that simply does not bring justice to the part of Jean Valjean and the stunning songs that he has throughout the story. Jackman does not it seem possess the power needed to pull of the songs we all know and love from the stage play. Just such a disappointment. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe, which did seem to be good casting, does manage to impart the feeling of menace to some degree but that is probably just his own character coming though but again, while slightly better than Jackman, does fail in expectation to the stunning songs that his character of Javert has throughout the play. Sounds like PC Plod humming to himself as he happily fits you up for some crime or another. <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway is dreadful in the extreme and manages to butcher every song she has performed and again is weak throughout. From listening to her I wold not care what happens to her just that it happened quickly so that it was over and done with. <br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter have managed to lose all the humor and warmth of their stage parts while managing to keep the dislike of their characters but for all the wrong reasons and their singing voices are utterly, utterly awful. Again powerful parts from the stage play ruined beyond all belief.<br/><br/>The only person that was it seems was any good was Eddie Redmayne and does a good job at his role of Marius. <br/><br/>With such expectation it was just so disappointing to hear the sound track and I would recommend that any one who wants to see Les Mis should see it in a theater where it seems this show belongs but not in a cinema where everything that this show had that made us all love it for so many years has been destroyed by Hollywood or who ever had the nerve to put this film out there.

Now don't get me wrong, the production sets, acting, costumes, and big screen epic stature are all there, but what was missing was the emotional story and connection to the audience. I guess I knew this wasn't for me about 10 minutes into this seemingly long slow moving movie when I found I was already wondering how long until it would be over. Now I'll admit the only song I really knew going into this movie was "" I dreamed a dream"" however, the endless non melodic off key vocalization by the entire cast with the exception of Anne Hathaway in my humble opinion simply ruined any chance this production would work for me and those movie goers who were seeking a memorable story put to music.

The wonderful, and powerful, music by Schonberg and Boublil was utterly decimated by the director and cast. The majority of the blame, though, has to go to the director.

I could hear some talent from some of the cast, no doubt, but no where near the level needed to pull off the approach taken by Tom Hooper. Not even close. And, the poor singing was all I could hear: the score itself was so poorly mixed that the music was completely lost to the singing.<br/><br/>Our dear director gave us the emotion, tragedy and insight expected from Les Miserables, but he forgot the music.<br/><br/>Horrible. 0 out of 10.

Problem is that with this and other strengths in the first hour, the rest of the film has a lot to live up to and, mostly, it doesn't really manage it. It runs to almost 3 hours and it really does feel long but weirdly at the same time it also feels rushed. It is hard to describe but the amount of story to be told seems too much to really fit in and do it well. As a result it never grabbed me quite as much as it had in that first hour; I still enjoyed it for its flair and spectacle but it felt like that is what I was watching, rather than characters or a story.<br/><br/>Beyond Hathaway the cast are not quite as strong. Jackman does well but not amazing; Seyfried is okay while Redmanye, Barks, Tveit and others are solid. Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter both overplay it but are amusing. The only real weak link is Crowe and it is a shame because he actually fits his character very well, it is just the fact that his singing voice is strained that poses a problem â€“ but it is a big problem when you're making a musical. The production values are tremendously high, with great sets, great costumes and around these Hooper gives us some great set-pieces â€“ with the downside of this being that it all seems so surface that it highlights the increasingly lack of much else going on elsewhere.<br/><br/>The film still is worth a look for this, but it is a shame that it peaks so early and only seems to slip away from there. It manages to feel overlong while also feeling rushed and needing more time; perhaps me not naturally being drawn to musicals was part of the issue, but it is a flawed but expensive film."
"jcheng94","10","26","50","22 December 2012"," The perfect musical film
","I had the pleasure of watching the film today; I entered the cinema with some degree of apprehension, as I thought it highly improbable for the film to live up to my impossibly high expectations of it as a huge fan of the musical, but any reservation I held was gone by the end of the Overture, and, for the next 150 minutes or so, I relived the first time I watched the musical at Queen's. By the end of the Finale, I was an emotional train wreck (though visibly still much more composed than many around me). <br/><br/>I will get the two gripes I have with the movie out of the way to make room for the considerable praise I plan on showering upon it. First and foremost is Russell Crowe's singing; it has been the subject of harsh criticism, and while I agree that it might not be to everyone's tastes (it certainly does not suit mine), it certainly is not quite as bad as the critics will have you believe. His voice is quite nasal, and his range limited, but there are moments (such as the beginning of ""Stars"") where one could see why he was cast. Second is the music direction (and by extension some of the performances); as a purist of sorts, I was unhappy with the number of cuts they have had to make to the songs, and some of the songs have had to be modulated down to make them more comfortable for Jackman and Crowe to sing. There are also some slight changes to the orchestration, some of which I find uncomfortable. Jackman's performance of ""Bring Him Home"" sounds a little strained, and is a little too aggressive-sounding for my tastes, though the sheer emotion he pours into it is undeniable.<br/><br/>Now for the good bits. The cinematography is stunning. The scenes in Greenwich, Portsmouth and the Alps are visually stunning, and the Parisian set in Pinewood with the barricade is a feast for the eyes. The CGI is unashamedly unrealistic and larger-than-life. These two factors alone could make a convincing argument for why there exists a need for film versions of musicals. Hooper's decision to fill the screen with the actors' faces in their numbers has been derided by some critics who claim that it reduces the movie to a glorified series of music videos, but I personally find that this makes for extremely immersive and intimate performances, as every twitch of the eye or the mouth is clearly visible. This works particularly well with the live singing, which makes it much more believable than any previous musical film effort. The sound recording, the costumes, the makeup: all wonderful and deserving of awards (if unconvinced, watch the ""making of"" featurettes on YouTube). All the performances exceeded my expectations (even Crowe's; the critics would lead you to expect something akin to Brosnan's performance in Mama Mia!). Jackman, with the exception of my personal indifference to his ""Bring Me Home"", is a phenomenal film-Valjean, whose highlights are definitely his soliloquy (""Who am I"") and his Death Scene. Bohen and Carter are excellent as the ThÃ©nardiers, bringing much needed comic relief to the movie. Barks, of whom I am a huge fan from her stage performances as Eponine, shines, with ""On My Own"" being one of the highlights of the film and is quite different from how she used to do it on stage. Redmayne's ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" is tear jerking, and he makes for an impressive Marius all-round. Allen and Huttlestone are among the best young-Cosettes and Gavroches I have ever seen. Seyfried's interpretation of the role is definitely not for everyone, but the fragile, sweet and somewhat bell-like quality of her voice captures the innocence and beauty of Cosette perfectly. The star, though, is without a doubt Hathaway, whose ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and death scene drew the most tears. Her acting and singing were sublime, and will influence all future performances of the character.<br/><br/>Les Miserables is a film not to be missed, if only to watch the acting performances from Hathaway, Redmayne, Barks and Jackman. It is different enough from the stage version for the fans to have something new to which to look forward, yet loyal enough for it to be able to serve as an introduction to the stage version. <br/><br/>And bring tissues. Lots of tissues."

","Wow. I don't think I have ever had such a different opinion on a movie. I liked alien 3 when no one else seemed to but wow. Guys I REALLY didn't like that. Now believe me I recognize why people like this movie so much, and even though the music is absolutely fantastic and I'm going to buy the OST, as a movie or at least THIS movie, it's just really bad. I feel terrible saying that since everyone loves this movie but I just have to get this off my chest.<br/><br/>There are many problems here but the one that the rest stem from is direction. Tom Hooper has showed us before with the king's speech and now again with this that he has absolutely no intention of making films for the sake of film. This man wants to win Oscars and that is all. The movie spends way to much time showing off that these actors are actually singing the songs on set, which is awesome and all but you could be using that time to make the plot slightly more interesting or slightly less convoluted. The only time this movie reached anything above boring and uninteresting is when Anne Hathaway is on screen. And she's great and she deserved the Oscar but we all (who where aware of the story of les mis) knew that the role was going to win the actress best supporting no matter who it was or how good she played it.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film and I tried pretty hard but considering a movie this boring goes on for an unforgiving 160 minutes I just couldn't stop pleading for the movie to end. Sorry guys."
"griffolyon12","6","18","33","31 December 2012"," A So-So Adaptation
","It has taken a long time, but Broadway sensation, Les Miserables, finally makes it to the silver screen with this cinematic adaptation, courtesy of director Tom Hooper. This musical set during the French Revolution, follows Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), from prison to finding religion while trying to evade French officer, Javert, who is after Valjean for skipping his parole board.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is in the performances of Hugh Jackman as Valjean and Anne Hathaway as prostitute, Fantine, who is shown kindness by Valjean on her deathbed, as she names him her daughter's guardian. There is an emotional authenticity to their performances, largely because the actors are freed and are able to act in the moment thanks to director Tom Hooper choosing to film all of the music live when they shot, rather than per-recording the tracks in the studio.<br/><br/>While Les Mis does hit all of the emotional beats, sending shivers down your spine during the beautiful songs, the plot feels fairly disjointed and is resoundingly flat when they're not singing one of the showstoppers. For instance, only when the characters Marius and Cosette are singing a duet do I feel emotion, but between memorable songs, the plot takes over and is full of gaping plot holes. Am I supposed to believe these two who have only met once when they are singing about how they can no longer go on without the other? Not to mention, the film's editing is often chaotic, causing confusion as to the spatial relationship in scenes with multiple characters, and the shot design never fully takes advantage of the grandeur of the tale, save for that beautiful opening shot.<br/><br/>To put it mildly, Les Miserables is an emotionally potent disappointment, that only has moments that never connect into a cohesive whole worthy of the beauty of the songs. <br/><br/>I give Les Miserables a 6 out of 10!"
"accelerantpictures","2","30","60","29 December 2012"," Outstanding performances from the actors; A not so outstanding performance from the director
","First off let me preface this by saying I have never seen the stage production. Having said that I was thrilled beyond belief to see this story unfold in front of me on the silver screen. As the story progressed I continued to be unnerved by the choices in camera angles, framing and slow focus pulls. As a film student who knows what a challenge it is to achieve crisp focus in scenes and have had to cut great footage because it is too soft to use am embarrassed. I am baffled why the director made certain choices, and I am not really sure who is at fault but it prevented me from me being able to enjoy this film. If you are not troubled by out of focus shots or cramped in your face framing then you might enjoy this film. I however expect such an esteemed director to not settle for anything less than perfection and as moviegoer's we should not either. Les Mis was miserable!!"

"keithbrown-90195","5","4","5","8 September 2016"," A Grand Musical Made Dull
","Firstly, if Tom Hooper wanted to make the musical more like Victor Hugo's novel, then he should have just adapted the novel. The changes here from the musical work against the movie's favor because they turn the fantastical into the mundane.<br/><br/>Secondly, recording all the songs live on the set is certainly impressive, but as an audience member it felt like it reduced the ability of the songs and the music to convey the emotion of the scene. In a musical, the emotions come from the songs, and when a song is sung in a slobbery whisper the emotions are muted, no matter how well or realistically the actor is crying. <br/><br/>Thirdly, the on-set recording also constricted the camera's ability to capture wide shots. This created a claustrophobic feeling and for a musical with as grand a story as Les Miserables this was a huge problem. It also made each song look and feel the same, which is a real problem for a musical like this where every line of dialogue is sung. It gets tedious very quickly. <br/><br/>Fourthly, I don't think Hugh Jackman can sing the part of Jean Valjean. ""Bring Him Home"" kind of falls off the mark from every other version I've seen. Acting-wise, sure, but this is a musical and I had a hard time buying him. Plus, that new song ""Suddenly"" is a bore and was certainly made and inserted solely for a chance at an Oscar. <br/><br/>Fifthly, the stage actors, Aaron Tveit as Enjolras and Samantha Barks as Eponine, are terrific. They carry their songs with confidence and ease. They were a pleasure to watch and listen to. It's a shame their great parts were reduced for the more famous members of the cast. <br/><br/>Lastly, I can't hate this. I love the stage show too much and despite this feeling completely different I still watch it from time to time."

","Full disclosure, in my opinion the 1998 version with Liam Neeson a near perfect telling of this story. <br/><br/>This version is not my kind of musical, and I know this will likely annoy those who like the sage version, but there are only 3 songs in this entire film as far as I can tell, they keep returning to three different themes for every number.<br/><br/>Some of the camera work is pretty poor, losing focus, and having to fix a few camera moves in post that were a little jarring. I get the feeling that it had to do with the way they filmed the singing.<br/><br/>And I feel that with the exception of Cosette (young and old) the whole thing was pretty horribly miscast.<br/><br/>I was happy to watch the annoying members of the French Revolution get killed in the street."
"rayruggeri","1","28","56","28 December 2012"," Les Mis film is botched by shaky camera and all those CLOSE-UPS!
","A truly epic, emotional stage musical is turned into a frustrating and annoying, TV adaptation due to several bad choices made by the director, Tom Hooper, who did the excellent ""The King's Speech."" Which classic film musicals has Mr. Hooper seen? Has he watched ""West Side Story,"" ""Cabaret"" ""Singin' in the Rain"" or even ""The Sound of Music?"" ""Les Miserables"" is practically opera and it's subject matter is, indeed, operatic. But instead of reinventing the stage musical for film, shooting in medium, or wide shots, he chose to put his camera right in the actor's faces making every single moment over-the-top and melodramatic. We, as the audience, never get a breather, let alone a breath. With such dramatic material as Victor Hugo and these characters, you don't need gigantic close-ups to make it dramatic. The drama is inherent in the material. Where do you go when you film almost every scene is close-up? Rather than heighten the impact of scenes, his wall-to-wall, in your face camera moves lessen the impact and weakens the material. His hand-held camera makes us dizzy after a while and it often goes out of focus during much of the film. It gave me a headache. This film is exhausting. I feel for the talented cast, many of whom are not trained singers. They try hard but, much of the time, they're performing for the last row of the balcony while the camera is up their nostrils. It was an interesting experiment to have the actors ""sing"" in the moment but this choice magnifies the uneven variety of singing talents. Hugh Jackman and Ann Hathaway come off best but the camera continually distracts us from some of their most emotional scenes. Russell Crowe comes off as a boring stiff and looks constipated, as if he'd rather be doing something else rather than straining for his top notes. What could have been a revitalization of the movie musical, with some great songs, ends up being a bombastic, relentless and utterly disappointing mess of a movie musical. Sometimes, less is more."
"isfsean","4","23","45","5 January 2013"," didn't quite grasp me as it did for others....
","Went to see this on opening night with an open mind. Having never seen the play, I was really excited to see it. Based on the previews, it looked really good and the music sounded amazing. <br/><br/>First off, I really liked the movie, however, the singing was a different matter. Although the story was very interesting, and I must admit, slow in parts, I couldn't get beyond the singing. Why the director chose to have these actors sing live is beyond me when they can't even sing in the first place. <br/><br/>Additionally, all these close ups of the actors singing really got me against the wall. The movie was shot as if the singing was the highlight of every scene, but why on earth would you allow these so call singers to try and hit these high notes when they can't. To me, it just ruins the whole scene. The director could've easily had the actors croon to their abilities without pushing them to mess up when they had to hit the high note. <br/><br/>That's not to say all the singing was horrible. Ann Hathaway did a decent job of singing and so did the girl who played Eponine, and also when the singing was in a group. Aside from that, Russell Crowe couldn't sing to save his life and, although, Hugh Jackman could unleash a vibrato, his singing was so off, I couldn't help but noticed it, although his acting was superb. <br/><br/>Readers who have an ear for music will agree that the singing was mediocre at best, but if you don't, fortunately for you, the movie was all that much better. Unfortunately, for me, the singing brought the movie down to a four star. After all, this is a musical just as much as it is a story, but if the music doesn't sound good, then it takes away from the story as it did for me. <br/><br/>Now, I'll just have to go see the play where they'll cast characters that can actually sing the part. <br/><br/>2 cents."
"phd_travel","1","38","80","3 January 2013"," Russell and Eddie are terrible
","What a shame that the miscasting of Russell Crowe and Eddie Redmayne should ruin a good half of the movie.<br/><br/>A most deserving Hugh Jackman gets to show a wider audience his charismatic Broadway and West End performer side. Unfortunately he doesn't sound as powerful and resonant in this movie as he does in real life. There has been some criticism about the method of recording the voices. It becomes quite apparent in some of Hugh's songs where his voice in the movie sounds thinner and weaker than on stage. Anne gives a moving performance. Maybe they didn't need to make her look so terrible after all it is a musical.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is seriously miscast. He is not leading romantic role handsome. He is more supporting cast character actor with his slightly crooked features. His voice is limited and sounded like he had a cold. Bad choice. Aaron Tveit, a real Broadway performer is so much better a singer and has more leading man looks. They should have switched roles.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe as expected has no singing voice whatsoever. Every time he sang it spoiled the movie and made it feel amateurish. He was completely monotonous and lacking in any emotion or passion in his singing. What were they thinking? Even if they wanted a movie star there are so many famous actors who can sing better. Or they could have done what so many prior screen musicals have done (My Fair Lady, Sound of Music) - dub his voice with a real singer.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried is a competent singer and is suited to her part. Helena and Sasha are alright in their comical supporting roles as well.<br/><br/>The battles and sets were more involving than on stage. Didn't like some of the strange camera angles and prolonged close ups. Some of the over the top cockney accents were ludicrous. <br/><br/>If you see it for Hugh and Anne be prepared to cringe when Russell and Eddie take over. Many great musical movies of the past are changed for the better from stage to screen but in this movie they didn't improve things and that was a disappointment. The seriously bad singing and miscasting just ruin the movie."

Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hooper. How could I go wrong?<br/><br/>In many ways it would seem. The film was just impossible to follow. The plot was completely indecipherable. It felt like a series of music videos taped together. Moving forward at a million miles an hour without taking any time to actually tell the story. It struck me as similar to a Michael Bay film, in that the plot was secondary to the visuals (and in this film's case, the songs).<br/><br/>Take nothing away from the principles, they're all fantastic. It's just a horrendous failure by the film makers. I shouldn't have to read the book before I go to this movie to understand what's going on. Having read about the story on Wikipedia after seeing it, it does sound absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately the film makers completely failed to capture that. Instead they've produced a series of music videos played together like on MTV. An appalling failure."
"spikey_jap","9","10","17","14 January 2013"," A musical that even musical haters can somehow enjoy!
","As a cinephile, my least favorite genres are easily romance and musicals; mainly because both genres have become way to clichÃ© over the past years. However, I was simply blown away by this movie and found this movie to be one of my favorites of 2012. <br/><br/>What surprised me about this film is that this is no ordinary musical where the actors will lip sync out of nowhere and everyone in the film will sing in a Glee-ful style. The cast in this movie sang most of the dialogue (around 98%) and this is what caught me off guard. Not only are the casts of this film singing, but they are putting out raw performances and I mean that these people are acting and singing at the same time, delivering raw emotions as these actors/actresses are singing. What even surprised me more was that I never felt that frustration or this sort of boredom as the characters are singing. All of the songs are sung to tell what is going on with the story, to present emotion toward the characters, and to easily add emotion toward the songs. All of these songs are extremely relevant for the plot and I have to admit, despite of not being a huge fan of musicals, to enjoy and like the music.<br/><br/>I have watched the 1998 dramatization of this story, starring Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman, Geoffrey Rush, and Claire Dames. Although the performances in that movie were good, I found the performances in this movie to over-exceed the performance, power and emotion delivered by the cast in the 1998 version. Many of the casts not only have nice vocals, but their performances were great and it absolutely blew me away. There were 3 main people that simply stole the show and they are Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Samantha Barks as Eponine, and easily Anne Hathaway as Fantine. I cannot say how much I enjoyed watching these 3 in the film. Hugh Jackman really brought the emotion toward the character and really made the character likable. Samantha Barks, who made her film debut in this, presented great vocals and as Hugh did, added emotion toward her character. Then comes Anne Hathaway who despite only appearing for a very short amount of time, caused me to cry enough to fill a water bottle. Her character is very tragic and watching her give out that raw performance while singing ""I Dreamed A Dream"" just made my eyes hurt because the amount of tears shed. She deserves every critical acclaim and praise and definitely deserves an award for her role. <br/><br/>Now if there is one actor that I should mention, that should be Russel Crowe. I have heard many complaints and have seen many fingers point Crowe to be the weakest link toward the film; I have to disagree. He is simply overshadowed by Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway to where he looks amateurish compared to the two. I actually didn't mind his performance and thought he presented a nice baritone voice for the character. Sure, he is not amazing and only presents a baritone range, but that doesn't mean that he sucked. He gave a good performance and did a good job with his portrayal as Javert.<br/><br/>However, despite the film being very powerful and surprisingly entertaining for me, I did find some flaws within the film that did sort of bugged me. I dug the whole plot of Les Miserables and agree that it is one of the greatest stories out there; however, I found the third part of the film, the plot about the French Revolution, to be not as strong as the first two parts. Personally, I found the love triangle between Cosette, Marius and Eponine to be stretched out a little too long. I understand that it is part of the story and I did enjoy it, but compared to the first two, it wasn't as strong and didn't really give me that strong impact as the others. Second has to be Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen's role as ThÃ©nardiers. I actually enjoyed their part as they are introduced and they had a very catchy tune that they sung. However, their role in the third part was sort of out of place; they appeared as a comic relief in an emotional scene that does ruin the mood at a certain degree. I do, however, like their performances and they did a good job portraying as these characters.<br/><br/>Director Tom Hooper easily brought enough emotion, character depth, and power to this musical to where the film had brought me into tears throughout various moments. I will easily admit that this film had brought me to tears throughout various moments and had me simply enjoy this film from start to finish. This film easily got me hooked and not only surprised me, but presented a musical that I actually enjoyed watching. It does take awhile to get used to the words being sung, but despite that, this film is worth watching. The only gripe that people might give is the length, which is close to 3 hrs. However, the plot is absolutely amazing, the songs help tell the story and the performances, especially from the 3 that I have mentioned earlier, made the film work. Even if you are not a fan of musicals, you may be surprised to find yourself not hate or even like this film."
"vileandaccursedthing","9","10","17","26 December 2012"," Better than expected
","Les Miserables is not easily translated to film, as any fan of the novel or the musical knows. There are enough failed movie versions out there to attest to this. I think that this time, thankfully, they got it about as ""right"" as it's ever going to get.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it certainly has its flaws, but it rises well above all the other musicals-turned-movies I've seen with the possible exception of RENT. However, all things considered, I can only think of three substantial complaints and of those, only one is glaring enough to have a real impact on the movie's quality.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe, who I am admittedly indifferent to in most movies, really managed to make the character of Javert unimaginably dull. He seems to be singing through an eternal yawn and although Javert is certainly not a character of high or fluctuating emotions, there are moments when something as simple as a facial expression would have made a world of difference. On the bright side, though, at least the man can carry a tune most of the time, unlike other stars cast in leading singing roles Gerard Butler...<br/><br/>My other complaints are solely about some of my favorite lines that were omitted, so not even worth going into detail on, but it leads me to a commendable point: as long as the stage show is, this film did an amazing job keeping it intact! Not perfect, but so much better than I ever imagined. Very little was lost to time constraints, I am so impressed.<br/><br/>The singing is appropriately unpolished, the cinematography is stunning, it was the best time I've had seeing a movie since I was a child. In many scenes, it feels like seeing the show for the first time no matter how many times you've seen the stage production. Anne Hathaway is my new favorite actress, she brought me to tears and I've never cried at a movie before. She really touches on a whole new depth to Fantine's despair, it seems almost impossible to see her performance and not leave the theater touched to the core.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was an excellent Valjean, in my opinion. His Soliloquy portrayed the conflict of the character in ways I really didn't think could translate to film and the warmth of his character after his personal transformation comes across beautifully. The Thenardiers were laugh-out-loud hilarious, little Cosette was the sweetest child ever, the casting of little Eponine was surprisingly excellent, Gavroche was absolutely charming, this was so well done, I cannot sing it's praises enough. All of the students were excellent in their roles, I was particularly in love with Enjolras, but whether that's because the actor is excellent or because he's my favorite character in the story anyhow, I don't know for sure. He and Grantaire were so wonderfully suited to their roles, it was easy to forget that this wasn't a genuine stage production from time to time. I thought that Marius and Cosette, two characters who are pretty one-dimensional usually, were far more likable in the film than in any of the stage productions I've seen. Not the most outstanding performances of the movie, but the actors did a lot with characters who have so little content, so kudos to them.<br/><br/>I live in a city full of pretty shallow people and not a single person I know around here had ever even heard of Les Mis unless I happened to drag them to the Twin Cities to catch a production when it passes through, musicals are NOT these people's thing, yet when the credits rolled, our theater erupted with applause. I was shocked! That alone speaks volumes to me of the quality of the movie and it's performances.<br/><br/>On a side note now - look, I know how a lot of people feel, those who are longtime Les Mis fans and who have a hard time accepting some of this casting. In a perfect world, this movie would star Patti and Colm and Phillip Quast (all respect to Terrance Mann) and Frances and Michael, but this is one of those cases where we have to remind ourselves not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Or rather, don't let the ideal be the enemy of the excellent. If you want to listen to Les Mis, the 10th anniversary is a great DVD to grab, the casting is nearly perfect. But to watch Les Mis and to experience it, this movie isn't going to disappoint you. Happy viewing!"

A woman who thought I worked at the theater let out a string of cuss words at me.<br/><br/>I don't really feel like giving a detailed, well-written review, but I thought it was marvelous and look forward to seeing it again.<br/><br/>The pros-Eddie Remayne - passionate performance, and worthy of recognition. Amanda Seyfried really makes Cosette something special. The young Cosette was a perfect match for Seyfried, and that little girl gave a lot of great moments (especially in the Thenardier Waltz of Treachery). Cohen and Carter were wonderful and their final moment was the funniest part of the film. The scenes in Paris to the finale were the highlights. The kid who played Gavroche was fantastic and I finally like that character now. I would love to see that kid get some recognition. Javert's final moment was unexpected and frighting, very powerful. Also, loved the factory ladies. Anne Hathaway I actually enjoyed at the end more than the beginning. Honestly, I found the film to be straight-forward and relatively gimmick free. Many plot holes and wrinkles in the stage show were ironed out here, such as the students' complete isolation at the barricades, the business with Marius' ring, Valjean's superhuman strength as he drags Marius through the sewers etc. And finally, Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar nomination. A win would be great but I doubt that will happen, but you're nuts if you think he won't get a nod.<br/><br/>The cons-Poor Russell Crowe. Where was that Gladiator? This guy is a great actor and has given some great performances, but he was just not even trying. I'm disappointed because I know he was capable of something much, much better. But he wasn't there. And Javert is so crucial, it just sinks the story a bit to not having him be a part of the story. The scenes up until Paris seemed to drag a bit for me (the heart and soul of Les Mis are always the barricade scenes). Master of the House was a great scene but a little restrained, not the showstopper it could have been. The freedom of the actors to dictate the underscoring is very jarring at first, but you get used to it and accept it and it works and makes the movie better.Overall, there was surprisingly too much restraint and realism for an epic film musical. I mean, Hopper could have made it a little more fun-you can't take a musical too deadly serious. I appreciate Hooper's desire to pull back, but there were moments he could have really packed a punch, but instead retreated.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was marvelous. The movie is NOT better than the stage version, and the stage version is NOT better than the movie, if that makes sense. They both work well together as companion pieces. The tugging at the heartstrings that made the stage show so popular is still there tugging on your heartstrings in the movie theater. I haven't loved a film musical so much since Chicago - and honestly, I think although Chicago is a much, much better work of art than Les Mis, I was more frustrated with Chicago the film than Les Mis the film. Interestingly, Russell Crowe and Richard Gere were the weak links in both these movies.<br/><br/>I don't know how this will fare with Oscar nominations or critics, but I will say that this movie is going to be a gigantic hit with repeated viewings. It makes you want to see it again because it is such a gigantic, detailed movie. Tween girls will fall in love with Marius and songs like ""On My Own"" all over again and Les Mis the musical is going to have an enjoyable second life.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's a story about Hope, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you miss that when you see Les Mis, you probably miss out on hope a lot."
"moviewizguy","5","19","37","30 December 2012"," Emotionally Manipulative in Almost Every Way
","Let me start off by saying I was really looking forward to the film, and I love musicals. I haven't seen the stage version or read the book or watched any other film adaptations, so I knew absolutely nothing about it. When the film started, I thought it was the lamest thing ever. The singing was a bit off and everything felt awkward to watch. And then Anne Hathaway showed up, and I cried like a baby 5 minutes later. Seeing a close-up of her singing ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in one take is easily the best part in the film. And when she died, it's apparent the film's strongest asset was gone. <br/><br/>After that, I was counting the minutes to the end credits. I didn't care for any of the other characters. In fact, the poor story leaves a lot to be desired: Why does Fantine die? No reason. Why does Jean Valjean die? No reason. Why do Cosette and Ã‰ponine like Marius? No reason. There is absolutely no build-up or development to make these choices feel motivated. Why should I feel sorry for Ã‰ponine? Why should I want Cosette and Marius to be together? Why the hell did Ã‰ponine sacrifice herself to save Marius? <br/><br/>After asking all these questions, the answer is obvious: The filmmakers are trying to make the audience cry. You throw logic out the window and aim for their hearts. Why do these incomprehensible and completely unmotivated scenes happen? So we would cry and feel sorry for these characters. Some people fell for it. I didn't. I saw how emotionally manipulative it all was, and I was honestly bored by it all. Imagine sitting in the theater for over 150 minutes being told to ""CRY. WEEP FOR THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE."" It gets funny after awhile. <br/><br/>If some people liked the film, fine, but I didn't care for it. I didn't care for the miserable characters in it. They aren't characters. They are plot devices to make people cry."
"aramis-112-804880","5","5","7","26 July 2015"," A Warning to Hard-Core ""Les Miz"" Fans
","Anyone not a ""Les Miserables"" fan, who just want to see a flashy movie with name-brand actors to get the gist of the stage show, may be satisfied by this flick.<br/><br/>First, my bona fides. It's the greatest theatrical experience I've ever seen (more than once). I own the London album, the Broadway album, a ""Complete"" album and an album of excerpts. On DVD I have the 10th anniversary production and a documentary called ""Stage by Stage"" (a history of how the show was put on). I know all the words, though I can't sing a note. Hey, I even read the unabridged novel.<br/><br/>First, the things it did right. The production values are wonderful. It looks great. The sets and costumes are astounding. Some of the casting is spot-on. Helena Bonham-Carter was born to play Madame Thenardier. Crowe was an inspired choice for Javert and Jackman, while not inspired, has done theatrical singing. Losing the ""Act"" structure, the Act-II show-stopper ""On My Own"" is in a better place in the movie.<br/><br/>Now, the things that made a hash of.<br/><br/>1)""Les Miserables"" isn't a ""musical"" but a full-blown opera. Therefore, while acting is important, the music must be the driving force. But instead of doing the music first and getting an ultimate flavor of the wonderful score, they decided to experiment and do the singing ""live"" -- that is, while the film was rolling, rather than mouthing to pre-recorded tunes. With the stars singing as they act, actors are guiding the music! Furthermore, it means when they're walking around their voices waver. Try singing and walking! I'm all for experimentation in the movies, but to take one of the biggest products ever to hit Broadway, whose music is beloved of millions, and to experiment in a movie of this scope was ridiculous, and it simply didn't work.<br/><br/>2) Some of the actors are not really good singers. In the old days, when they knew how to do musical movies, they might take an actor like Gloria Graham in ""Oklahoma"" and have her singing again and again and again and then splice together all the times she accidentally wobbled into tune. Here, some of the singing is simply not worthy of the music.<br/><br/>(Spoilers below) <br/><br/>3) A few subjective disappointments: <br/><br/>a) the Thenardiers were meant to be comic relief, a bit of light-heartedness coming in after all the horrors. But the lethargic, dreamlike, nightmarish way ""Master of the House"" is presented hardly raises the spirits (if you want the ultimate in spirit-raising ""Masters"" try Barry James in ""Stage by Stage"" which is included in the ""Les Miserables"" 10th anniversary concert--he's a hoot). Helena does well, but ""Master of the House"" should be raucous and here, it's whispered. I'd like to have heard Helena turned loose and shouting like other Madame Thenardiers I've seen.<br/><br/>b) At the end, the Thenardiers are humiliated by being carried bodily out. Well, the Thenardiers should be humiliated . . . but I think they should go out with their heads high, knowing that the world belongs to the likes of the Thenardiers, and their type always do worm to the top of the dungheap. And their singing, being done live, is rotten when they're being carried out. Double whammy.<br/><br/>(BIG SPOILER)<br/><br/>c) The ending was affecting (yes, I cried, as I always do, even when I see it in concert). But they have too many closeups and they made two absolutely dumb decisions. The first was to lose that great harmony at the end between the ghosts of Fantine and Eponine, which is always beautiful (and what happened to Fantine's hair? Usually, she is restored to her full beauty when she comes back as a ghost.) The second dumb decision was, in the reprise of ""Do You Hear the People Sing"" to show an endless barricade, hung with French flags. Frankly, and this might just be me, I find the idea that Heaven is a kind of barricade absolutely repulsive. Because of this idiotic image (which, admittedly, was beautifully done) I won't even have a copy of this flick in my house. Shame on you! Shame! <br/><br/>d) ""One More Day"" (in some versions, ""One Day More"") was the big Act I climax. Losing the Act structure meant they might have feared they couldn't have a climax at that time in the film, so they downplay the whole thing, but I didn't find it at all exciting or moving (and since they were comic relief, would it have been too awful, after some of the imagery presented in ""Master of the House,"" to have the Thenardiers stick their heads up out of a sewer grating like they do on stage, which is always good for a laugh? <br/><br/>e) In ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,"" when Marius is braying about seeing phantom faces at the windows and phantom shadows on the floor, would it have been too much effort to show the images he's seeing? They do such wonderful things in film. How about swinging the camera around him and in one sweep, seeing his fallen comrades and then in the next sweep, they're gone? Just to get inside Marius' head for a moment! Criminy, people, don't movie-makers have any imagination these days? If Heaven can be an endless barricade (if I get there I hope there won't be any more fighting, for God's sake!) they can show a phantom face at a bloody window.<br/><br/>Are there more problems with this movie? You bet. I started with the worst offenders (live singing) and worked down to subjective disagreements that have nothing to do with the film per se. IMHO--what a disaster! To borrow from another famous work of fiction, ""The Horror!"""
"mistabobdobolina","5","5","7","21 July 2013"," The staging was spectacular, but... the singing?
","I rented this and, as a lifelong fan of the musical who has grown up with productions and recordings, I tried to keep my expectations in check and my mind open. But, wow... I really found myself struggling to make it all the way through.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes and staging were, of course, spectacular as only film can deliver. And there were some fine performers and interesting acting choices. So, maybe the director decided that the singing should be third priority behind these things? Les Miserables can be done well as a straight-ahead non-musical movie. But the *musical theatre version* cannot be staged well without the music taking centre stage; without it, what's left is really just a thin melodrama. And the fact is that the singing in this production -- at least from some of the key leads -- is on balance quite shockingly bad. <br/><br/>You may have gone in already knowing this about Russell Crowe; I had wondered if the Onion piece lampooning him as ""completely disappearing into the role of a man who cannot sing or act"" was being over-harsh, but it isn't. I was disagreeably surprised, though, to find it also true of Hugh Jackman, who is supposed to come from a musical background and yet whose awful, almost comically nasal rendition of Valjean set my teeth on edge constantly. Other great, juicy arias of the musical are criminally underserved and under-sung by such otherwise fine talents as Helena Bonham Carter (and whoever that guy is who's failing to play Thenardier) and Amanda Seyfried (who actually has a good voice but seems to have been directed to swallow half the notes). <br/><br/>Granted, it's not all awful. Anne Hathaway swallows half the notes of Fantine's great arias too, for instance, but at least she does it in service of selling the character's death by consumption. Eponine is excellent, and of course, the best-known Valjean of all time appears in a cameo as the Bishop... and serves up a shining moment of the aural richness that the musical is usually known for.<br/><br/>But those few bright spots don't quite rescue what look to me to be fundamentally misguided direction and production decisions. Impressive spectacle though it is, it's not as impressive as it should be as a musical, and I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theatre, as I was tempted to do."
"Michael_Elliott","5","8","13","28 December 2012"," Beautiful Looking But Has Real Pacing Issues
","Les Miserables (2012)<br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>I've never seen such a beautiful film so perfectly put together but fall so terribly apart. I will admit upfront that I've never seen any musical version of this Victor Hugo story so I really didn't have any expectations going in. The story itself is a classic as Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) can't escape his past and especially with Javert (Russell Crowe) constantly on his trail. LES MISERABLES, on a technical level, is quite an achievement and I must say that I might even call it flawless. The costume designs are downright breathtaking as were the set designs. I know some of the sets were created using CGI but I never found them to be distracting as they blended in quite well with the real footage. I also thought the music score was performed at a very high quality and help spark some energy. I also thought the performances were strong for the most part. The ""live singing"" approach was a mixed bag but I thought Jackman did an extremely good job with it. I also thought Anne Hathaway was good during her numbers including the emotional ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" which was clearly the highlight of the film. Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and Amanda Seyfried were all good in their roles as well. It seems most of the controversy is coming from Crowe but I thought he was just fine. He was perfect for the character but it seems his singing is upsetting most people. While it wasn't what you'd typical expect to see in a musical, I thought it was good enough and in some ways its roughness fit the character. Now, the biggest problems with me and this film is that there simply wasn't any emotional connection to any of the characters. I thought this here was the film's fatal flaw because there was just nothing here that drew me to the characters and I must say that I wasn't overly impressed with all of the songs. I also felt the running time really dragged due to some poor pacing, which caused this film to seem twice as long as it really was. With that said, I'm guessing those who love the musical are going to love this version. It certainly has the look and sound but to me that simply wasn't enough."
"valentinius-14566","1","6","9","5 June 2019"," Pretty awful
","Had this film been made in the 1960s, it probably would have been glorious (and yes I know it hadn't been written yet).<br/><br/>What a disappointing film adaptation of a soundtrack I had been listening to for years, had seen on stage, and had long hoped someone would turn into a movie.<br/><br/>I had also seen Stage By Stage: Les Miserable on VHS many times, as well as the Dream Casts. When I saw this movie I was thinking about how nothing in it could begin to compare to so many performances done by so many years before.<br/><br/>Whoever was in charge of casting should have tomatoes thrown at them. I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters in this film.<br/><br/>I remember looking very much forward to the Master of the House number and then thinking afterwards, ""What on earth did they do to this song?"". So bland. It didn't sound at all like I had expected.<br/><br/>And the sex scene with Anne Hathaway playing Fantine...who's bright idea was that? Guess they figured they needed some ""grittiness"" in order to maintain some kind of integrity within the film owing to the dark nature of the novel, and keeping it real for a 21st Century audience. I don't really know.<br/><br/>Probably the most memorable scene was when Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and the other prisoners were pulling a large ship into dry dock at Toulon by hand. I believe they showed part of that scene in the previews. They chose wisely, as that was about the only cool thing they had to show.<br/><br/>I don't remember much else about the film production. Very little sticks to the ribs.<br/><br/>This is one film that I would have no problem with being remade. Maybe someone someday will get it right."
"jdslider12","10","6","9","20 January 2013"," A Pleasant Surprise with Wonderful Performance
","This movie is a truly engaging, cinematic achievement, which will remain in hearts and minds for some time. The familiar lead characters: Hugh Jackman, Russel Crowe, and Anne Hathaway do a phenomenal job in their varied roles, providing a surprising and stimulating performance. An integration of various whimsical/funny elements are introduced, while offset and led by the dramatic.<br/><br/>While this movie IS a musical throughout, which should be known and understood to a prospective viewer, the singing becomes second to the story, which is triumphant in its portrayal.<br/><br/>For those who can can immerse themselves into the story, and not get distracted by the musical elements, they should find themselves caught off guard, inspired, and lifted up by this really wonderful production. It was certainly worth the time spend in viewing it and in the money paid to share in this grand experience. Based on its category, and up front understanding of Les Miserables, the whole of this movie is well deserving of its high ratings. I give it 10/10. To me, worthy score, leaving my nit-picking of small details off to the side, as they do not detract from the whole of it."
"nino-scholz","9","6","9","20 January 2013"," Great Story, Great Movie
","I've never been a big fan of musicals. I was recently introduced to this story via some earlier movie versions and began reading the book. Regardless of adaptation, the story is a great one. It is a critique of man's ways and a story of redemption(s).<br/><br/>I found this adaptation to be very ""human"". Actors are shown with all flaws showing, and many added for the roles being played. The singing was great at times, flawed at others, but a good mix of the two. Again it was nice to keep the human aspect intact with the singing. It was easy to connect with the characters due to the visual and audible humanness about them.<br/><br/>I found Eddie Redmayne's performance to be one of the best - he portrayed his characters emotion on his face and in his voice - and in his eyes - nicely. I'm surprised to not hear more about his performance.<br/><br/>Most of all, Les Miserables is a great story! It is food for thought, a social commentary, and at the same time entertaining. If you are not familiar with it as i was until recently, i highly recommend checking it out - again, for the amazing story on it's own."
"TheInvisibleCar","8","6","9","26 December 2012"," Not done in the style of most musicals and an excellent movie.
","Just to warn people, there are two big criticisms you really shouldn't let bother you: 1.) It's not Broadway, because it's a movie. No matter what, it was never going to be the same thing as a good stage production of Les Miserables anyway. 2.) No movie should be expected to be completely faithful to a book. If somebody paints a painting about something, and later, somebody writes a song about the exact same thing, people don't expect the lyrics of the song to perfectly explain the painting, but this movie is fair and true enough to the original Victor Hugo novel and story. In the case of the original Les Miserables, Victor Hugo's novel from the 1800s is 1,900 pages long and it wasn't a musical anyway. You couldn't fit all of a book that size into 5 movies, but this movie is true enough to the original story. Plus it fits in almost all of the original Broadway production music.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm not really a big fan of musicals, in fact I tend to not like them, Oklahoma-boring, South Pacific-who cares. About the only musicals I ever really liked include Pink Floyd The Wall and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.<br/><br/>But this movie is excellent, as in everybody-in-the-theater-claps-at-the-end excellent.<br/><br/>It's basically not done in song and dance style. Characters are moving around and in action the whole time. There is some spoken dialogue, but it is done very much in the style of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a movie in which 100% of the dialogue is sung. These are basically the only two musicals of this type of style or technique. In The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, you quickly don't notice they are singing at all anymore, and you go through the whole movie as if you are just listening to people talking or arguing, but in this Les Miserables, sometimes you don't notice that they are singing, while other times, well, they are definitely belting it out, but still within the flow of dialogue, and the action of the movie keeps going. They don't interrupt the action to stop and do a big tap dance and singing number or anything like that. In fact, you don't even notice when they are going from straight spoken dialogue and back to singing, sometimes even mid-sentence, and sometimes a character is replying to singing with spoken dialogue, as the two get mixed right in together perfectly.<br/><br/>It you just want the Les Miserables story in a movie but without the music, then watch the 1997 version directed by Bille August, as that is a really good movie. (And includes stars Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes and Geoffrey Rush.)<br/><br/>But remember, the musical Les Miserables has been more to the stage than what movies like The Godfather or even Casablanca ever were to the silver screen. It's number one, with more people having seen a stage production of Les Miserables than Annie, Cats, South Pacific, The Phantom of the Opera, Chicago, Rent, Miss Saigon, Evita, or anything else, and there is a reason for that and that reason is basically the music. Along with the story of course, but its music is really just that powerful.<br/><br/>You could just watch a recording of some NYC or London stage production of Les Miserables on DVD. There are plenty of those, including ones that are hardly even stage productions but rather more so just opera singers on stage taking turns singing the music. But you aren't going to get a movie type story experience out of those. Just the same, no matter how well done, a good Broadway quality stage performance of Les Miserables is going to be 5 times better than even a perfect Les Miserables musical movie. <br/><br/>This movie is produced like a movie and not as the filming of a stage production.<br/><br/>A movie movie, as we expect it, sets its scenes wherever they need to be. When a character is hiking over the top of a mountain, they are actually there filming on the top of a mountain. That is how this movie usually is. When they are out on the streets of Paris, they are out on the streets of Paris. It's a movie. And it's the story well told. And it's the music. All in one.<br/><br/>Putting all of those things together in one Les Miserables movie, well it's hard to imagine anybody doing it much better or even trying to. A few imperfections or weaknesses are there, but not enough for anybody to try to outdo it anytime soon. Some of the outdoor scenes could have been shot on a location in some French city or town, rather than having buildings or skylines look so much like stage sets or computer generated images. Next to none of the waterfront scenes looked like they were just shot on an actual location, with all sorts of ships and things looking like stage sets or computer generations. Some of the actors could have cut their cockney stage accents for just straight modern English occasionally touched with French accents or pronunciations as needed. (After all, they already weren't shooting in French, so why bother with any fake old timey stage accents that only make characters that much harder to understand?) They could have taken a page from The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and seriously stuck to realism and naturalism, rather than appearing as stage performers performing on a stage so much. There were some mighty wobbly cameras in a few scenes. <br/><br/>Even if you are not big fan of Victor Hugo or of musicals, this should still be enough of an action and adventure movie to keep you well entertained. It's long, but that was something unavoidable in order to fit in both enough of the story and the music. <br/><br/>Overall, it's excellent. A rare 9 out of 10 stars for me."

Well, i love it, and like it quite a bit too. It is a wonderful big-screen realization of a wonderful stage production. The cast does outstanding work, and the orchestration is superb as well. This film deserves Oscar nominations for acting, scoring, art direction/set decoration and costume design. I thought the editing could have been somewhat tighter. And i was put off by the new song that was included in the middle of the movie, which slowed down the plot development unnecessarily. In fact, i wished instead of the new song, the more enjoyable Little People number could have been used in full. Stand-out song performances included Anne Hathaway (I Dreamed a Dream), Russell Crowe (Stars), Hugh Jackman (Who Am I?), Eddie Redmayne (Empty Chairs and Empty Tables) and Daniel Huttlestone (Look Down). Those who are not familiar with the story may wish to check out the non-musical Les Miserables with Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush first, before catching this musical version."

Everyone must admit that if they had never read the book or watched the Liam Neeson version of Les Miserables (1997)(which was a great movie) they would be totally lost on the plot. There are movies that are called musicals like Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, Singin' in the Rain, that have dialogue along with some songs thrown in the mix and these are great fun movies to watch. But C'Mon! Did they really have to incessantly sing every word in this long-winded spectacle? It was so overused and detracted from what is really a great story.<br/><br/>The Imax version was all that was available at the time so I spent the extra dollars, only to be wasted when I was so ""miserable"" that I left about half way through it was that bad.

","It is very rare that a movie makes you feel the way this film does. Also, I am not a big fan of musicals and have only seen a few film adaptations of musicals over the years. Therefore, it is fair to say that I went into this film with a fair deal of scepticism. However, as soon as this film began I knew I was in for a ride. By the time the credits rolled I was nearly in tears and I am sure most of you will be. <br/><br/>To start with, the music and the actors singing the music are absolutely superb. The music is as emotional as it gets and ties in amazingly well with the film's themes. In addition, there is not one actor who doesn't pull his or her weight to make this the musical masterpiece which it is. <br/><br/>Essentially, the main theme running throughout the film is oppression and this is conveyed in stunning fashion by Hugh Jackman who steals the show and leaves you breathless for the 2 1/2 hour running time. His voice and facial expressions depict a man who has endured endless suffering and pain and is still willing to sacrifice more to help those in need such as Ann Hathaway's character. However, he is not a perfect human being and makes mistakes which he tries to rectify and this is why we root for him. By the end of the film he feels more like a close friend than an actor.<br/><br/>All other actors such as Ann Hathaway and Russell Crowe deliver near-perfect performances and are also amazingly talented in the singing department. You would struggle to hold back the tears once you hear Ann Hathaway singing, the now infamous song, 'I dreamed a dream'. Despite what other critics say, Russell Crowe's character is also portrayed in stunning fashion by the immensely talented actor who we all know. <br/><br/>Lastly, the cinematography in this film is also remarkably stunning. The camera pans close to the face of each character whenever they sing to show you what they are feeling in that moment. The film is also able to warp you back to the 1800's and make you believe that you are in France during that time period due to excellent production values and this is not surprising considering the amount of money having been spent to produce the film.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper the director has created an astonishing masterpiece which must be seen by the most casual of film fans. If you do not like musicals, wait until you see this one!!!!"
"ganeshsubramanian","9","7","11","24 January 2013"," Pain and Suffering are Universal. Les Miserables too!.
","Pain and Suffering are Universal. Les Miserables too!. The notion this movie portrays is also Universal in the sense that the indomitable human spirit survives the worst in life with an absolute gusto. As the characters undergo Pain and Suffering moment after moment, the emotional journey becomes an excellent envelope of the story. It is this emotional journey that holds the movie together.<br/><br/>Acting (& Singing live!!): I knew that Hugh Jackman is highly talented, but this movie brings out his rather quiet side skill of singing as well. His acting and singing are absolutely superb!. Special mention for 'What kind of a man am I' and 'Bring him Home'. Jackman brings up an exquisite portrayal of the redemption-seeking ex-prisoner. His performance stands out from the rest of the cast. Russel Crowe as the Inspector Javert has done excellent. The rest of the reviews point out that his singing has not been even up to the mark (as required for a heavyweight character as his) but I found that his rendition has been great. Javert's monologue before his suicide deserves a special mention. I would say that he has been absolutely world class in his performance. Anne Hathaway portrays the poor Fontaine struck in a rut on pain, suffering and despair. Her rendition of 'I dreamed a dream' will definitely notch her awards and accolades. Samantha Barks as the heart-broken Eponine gives a great performance as well. I felt that the weak link in terms of singing was Amanda (as Cosette). The comic relief provided by Cohen and Carter was very good. Everyone else including Marius and their friends, as I see, performed remarkably well in their portrayal of their characters.<br/><br/>Cinematography, Costumes and Direction: Cinematography set against a backdrop of the 19th century post-revolution France is excellent. Costumes are perfectly apt for all the characters. Director Tom Hooper has provided us a stunning movie portrayal of the stage version. Perfectly adapted for the big screen, the movie is as close as it could get to Hugo's book. Director's insistence on live singing by the actors has made the movie an excellent treat to watch. His portrayal of the pain and suffering on the faces of various characters through close-ups throughout the movie is marvelous!.<br/><br/>I have not seen the stage version yet, but would like to experience the same given that I felt emotionally drenched out (and hence feeling much better about grief and pain) after the movie.<br/><br/>My rating would be a 9 out of 10. The movie is worth watching few times in order to sink in with the emotions and should definitely be owned in a DVD version as a collector material. Regards, Ganesh."

","I feel like I'm about to explode! I just had what I can only describe as the best movie experience of my life. I don't even know where to begin So I'll start at the beginning.<br/><br/>I came across a book.. a really thick book in an old book store and bought it. I never read the book for a long time because it would require a lot of patience to get through it. It was written in a time and about a time that was way beyond my understanding. But I had to read it. Not reading it would be a sin. It was an incredible book! Yes. There was a lot that I didn't understand.. like the war, the revolution, among other things. But the writing oh the writing. Victor Hugo wrote his characters and their stories so beautifully. I fell in love with all of them. Eponine, the poor miserable Eponine. Gavroche, that sweet little rat whose death was so brave and so tragic. Jean Valjean, that wretched soul who tried so hard to be good. Cosette and Maruis, lovers in a hard world. Enjolras and the Friends of the ABC who were invincible. Javert, who had no room for gray in his world. I loved them all. It's only great writing that can embrace you into a story even when you don't understand much that is going on.<br/><br/>Then came the musical. It wasn't what I would expect in a musical. But I had an open mind, cos I love musicals. For me it was one of those musicals that can actually change your life. I was lucky that I got to watch the one with the dream cast. Watching Philip Quast as Javert was an experience that I will never forget. The lyrics of the songs were larger than life. The singing was so incredible I thought my heart would burst! The actor who played Maruis annoyed me because of his sweaty upper lip. But everything else the Thenardier husband and wife singing 'Master of the House'; the prisoners singing 'Look Down'; Fantine singing 'I Dreamed a Dream; the ABC singing 'Red and Black as well as 'Do You hear the People Sing' I could go on and on. Those were wonderfully written songs. You didn't need anything else to understand what was happening. I never imagined a musical would be able to accomplish a task that could clearly only be done with a movie.<br/><br/>And finally.. The movie itself that caused me to stay awake till 4 in the morning with this feeling like my heart is going to burst. I can still hear the echoes of the songs. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean was a treat. I can't believe that was Wolverine!! Anne Hathway had a short role as Fantine but she ruled my heart. The child actors playing Cosette and Gavroche were unbelievable. It was quite tragic to actually watch Gavroche die on screen (Manly tears were shed by my movie date). Enjolras is the most badass and the most beautiful man I've ever set eyes on. Russell Crowe was no match to Philip Quast as Javert. Watching the action along with the marvelous songs and music, and the amazing acting from the entire cast all of it was just very overwhelming. I'm still recovering.<br/><br/>To love this film is to see the face of God!"

","Hugh Jackman stars as embittered parole-breaking 19th century French ex-convict Jean Valjean turned benevolent factory owner and wealthy town mayor Monsieur Madeleine, adopting and raising a child from the slums of Paris while evading re-imprisonment at the hands of police inspector Javert (played by Russell Crowe) during the rise of France's post-Revolution 1832 June Rebellion, in this surprisingly undercooked but visually impressive stage-to-screen adaptation of Brit stage producer Cameron Mackintosh's 1985 English version of Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's 1980 French musical based on famed French writer Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Miserables. Yes, all the characters are French, yet they all have British accents here. #odd <br/><br/>Both Jackman and Anne Hathaway pull in incredibly disarming stellar performances here. Hathaway plays emotionally shattered fired factory worker Fantine who falls into prostitution to continue supporting her estranged and impoverished young daughter Cosette - the famed poster child of Les Miserables, played here by feature first timer Isabelle Allen. It's literally gob-smacking how effortlessly Jackman and Hathaway elevate this theatrical work beyond its big screen flaws and oftentimes relentless lyrical dialog to a superior cinematic level of characterization during their scenes. Top marks also go to cinematographer Danny Cohen for capturing those master class moments. Awesome!<br/><br/>However, there's a dilemma. Those performances are exceptionally wonderful and probably wouldn't have been seen otherwise, but the film Les Miserables as a whole has problems. The storytelling is weak and disjointed. Primary supporting characters are barely fleshed-out. Deeper motivations are oversimplified or glossed over, as though you don't need this movie to actually tell you what's going on or why you should care. How, for instance, does Javert, a prison guard in the opening scenes, become transferred as a policeman to Valjean's tiny grubby town later on? Was he fired? Reincarnated? Does it matter? Has anyone here read the book? Quick, Google SparkNotes! Hush, another crying big face is singing on-screen:<br/><br/>I dreamed a dream this film was prime; My hopes were high but then (sniffle,) I saw it...<br/><br/>I realize this picture is adapted from the hugely successful, self-proclaimed longest-running stage musical to date, where large portions of Victor Hugo's richly detailed manuscript were likely already chopped out or shorthanded to accommodate the songs while offering a run-time those in the loge would sit through nightly, but Crowe specifically was robbed here. Compared to Jackman, it's fairly obvious that Crowe was either given little more than a stock heavy's wisp of a character outline to work with beyond the wardrobe and tunes or the majority of what this hugely capable screen actor poured into his purposefully antagonistic role ultimately fell victim to overindulgent deletion in editing. Maybe he should have cried more to gain scenes, I don't know. Co-cast members Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, and newcomer Samantha Barks aren't treated much better throughout, as adult Cosette, her love Marius, and his secret admirer Eponine respectively. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen appear to be the only other survivors, hamming it up all teeth and elbows through their comedic relief scenes as The Thenardiers.<br/><br/>The blame for how poorly cobbled this offering of wasted opportunities is over-all lays squarely in the lap of director Tom Hooper, who obviously couldn't be bothered to earn his paycheck using the wealth of his entire cast's talent matched with the power of filmmaking to balance out what came from the stage production, and over-ride screenwriter William Nicholson's clear inability (or fear) to reintroduce elements from Hugo's original material to make this movie something more - oh, I dunno - appropriately cinematic: Solid story. Strong plot points. Rich characters. Compelling dialog. Little things like that. Something more than adding mud and horses to the mix. Hooper might as well have had Cohen shoot the London musical on-set/location without these parachuted celebs. Barks' reprised Eponine, and Colm ""Broadway/West End Valjean"" Wilkinson's Bishop of Digne cameo aside, at least that stage cast could have enjoyed a cut of the film's 61 million USD budget. After-all, they were good enough at playing their roles to make the show so popular for so long that UK studio Working Title Films came a-knocking, right?<br/><br/>Comparing movie to movie - and there are many film versions of Hugo's ""Les Miz"" to choose from - just check out the four-time Oscar-nominated Les Miserables (1935) starring Fredric March as Valjean and Charles Laughton as Javert. That classic's adapted from Hugo's novel; it's not a musical, but watch it and you'll immediately realize how outrageous the hype for this comparably empty, prolonged music video of catchy tunes and missed notes truly is.<br/><br/>Sure musical-lovers, go see Les Miserables if taking in a star-studded matinée version of the internationally renowned stage musical suits your budget better than buying tickets to the actual theatrical production might (if available.) At 157 minutes in length, it's also probably faster seeing it than reading Hugo's novel. Just don't be surprised if - beyond the memorable tunes, amazing sights and incredible performances from Jackman and Hathaway - you spend most of this screening wishing for far more developed supporting characters and fundamentally cohesive storytelling normally expected at the movies, and you realize maybe you should have read the book or seen another film version of Les Miserables beforehand. Or, instead. Reviewed 12/12, © Stephen Bourne.<br/><br/>More reviews: moviequips.ca Follow: @moviequips"

","I actually loved Phantom of the Opera, watched it 3 times. Thought I'd give this one a chance. After 45 minutes I shut it off. Ann Hathaway was just awful and Hugh Jackman wasn't any better. I never gave Crow a chance to see if he was any better. BORING- BORING. Glad I didn't waste my time and money to see it in the theater. There was way to MUCH singing, would have been better if at least half of it were just talking. Phantom was also singing when the time was right, but there was half of it just speaking too. If you want to watch the story, and it really is a good story, watch the one with Liam Neison and Jeffery Rush, excellent movie!"

","We had no intention of seeing this film as it sounded and looked awful, but were finally brow-beaten into it by two different couples (whose taste we generally agree with). They assured us that it was wonderful, spectacular, and drove them to tears.<br/><br/>Well, about five minutes into it, I was moved to tears, too -- realizing I'd made a horrible mistake. All of our worst fears about this film were true -- horrible, horrible ""singing"" and miscasting right and left. Not to mention, we're in frickin' France -- what's up with the little cockney kid? When did it turn into Oliver? <br/><br/>I don't understand why people are gushing over this mess, and why in the world Anne Hathaway is nominated for an Oscar, much less the shoe-in favorite to win it. She was on screen for about five minutes before she croaked. I was completely unmoved by her performance -- it all happened too fast to care what happened to her. Character development, anyone? <br/><br/>All the way home, my husband and I mockingly made up our own lyrics and sung them in the over-the-top, terrible style of just about everyone in the film. That was far more entertaining, and a much better use of our time. Now, if I could only have my $22 and 2-3/4 hours of my life back. Miserable, indeed."
"carolineboras","1","33","72","25 December 2012"," Where to Start...?
","Where to start? This movie was just bad. I should probably say that I've seen the stage show of Les Mis 9 times. I went into the movies expecting to be underwhelmed, but I never thought I would walk out of the theater disappointed enough to sit down and write this review for it. <br/><br/>Almost everything about this movie was wrong. The two people who could actually sing (Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit) were only given small opportunities to show their talent. The rest of the cast was either underwhelming (Helena Bohnam Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen) or bad (Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe). <br/><br/>The classic musical numbers that make Les Mis spectacular were completely unrecognizable. Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" reminded me of when Dory decided to speak whale in Finding Nemo. ""Master of the House"" and ""Beggar at the Feast,"" two comical numbers were scaled down so much that I wonder why they even bothered putting the two in the movie. ""Stars,"" my all time favorite Les Mis song was butchered by Russell Crowe, who sounds worse than Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia! Jackman's ""Bring Him Home"" was the cherry on top of a collection of poorly executed songs. <br/><br/>A lot of people are complaining about the ""Blair Witch"" camera work, and I have to agree. It's distracting and takes away from the movie. Also, it provides the audience with a close up view of the saliva in the actors' mouths. Gross. <br/><br/>I will admit, I am very biased, but I think that everyone involved in the movie should have realized that a lot of the audience members have grown up with the 10th Anniversary cast recording or have actually seen the show. <br/><br/>If you're seeing this because you've seen the musical, think twice. It is nothing like the stage production. If you're seeing this because you read the book, think twice. It is similar to the book, but not enough to pass as an adaptation of it. If you've seen it and read it, go see Django Unchained instead. I've heard it's pretty good. I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't."

From the first shots the song of the slaves is dominating and the scene is filmed in a majestic way (so as the whole movie). Sometimes some dialogues are sung by the characters when it is not necessary (and the viewer loses concentration). Apart from this, it seems to be at the theater. The songs remain impressed and the drama/revolution is appeased by the comedy of the two scammers. Tom Hooper has realized both a good remake and musical."

","This movie was the first musical I ever watched and it made me love the musicals. Cast plays really well although it is not easy to sing and play at the same time. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and the other cast are successful on that. I got the emotions clearly while watching the movie. Of course, Victor Hugo, author of the book, Les Miserables, played an important role in beauty of the movie because the book is one of the best. While I was watching the movie, I remembered the book that I read almost 15 years ago. I perceived the same feelings after 15 years and that made me really happy. The movie tells the virtues of French Revolution in a touchy manner. Vivre la France..."
"nvanvalleygirl","6","2","2","20 April 2015"," Inconsistent but OK
","Thought parts of this film outstanding. I wasn't enamoured by all the casting. Some offered great marquee value, but mediocre vocal value. Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and actress playing Epinome were brilliant. For a musical to be turned into a film, this was one of the better one's I've seen, but still prefer this one live. Nothing beats seeing the volume of live singers on stage singing One More Day and Do You Hear the People Sing. The film can't capture close to this. Aside from that stylistically, I disliked the number of close ups and found the fact that they went in and out of focus as the performer moved singing irritating. Really pulled me out of the film."
"danwildv","10","2","2","4 August 2013"," A great bridge between Hollywood and Broadway.
","This is less of a review and more of a reply to the negativity surrounding this film.<br/><br/>May I just start by saying that I saw this production on Broadway when I was about ten years old and maybe because of my age, it was never something that appealed to me but now at the tender age of 31, I find myself a lot more open minded. Not remembering the story, I was completely in the dark with what to expect from this movie. Quite honestly I was blown away and found it to be mesmerising.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have complained that it's nowhere near as good as the live stage production but I think that these very same people are missing the point. This is an on screen adaptation of the very well known musical and there has to be some sort of bridge here. I'm sure those who live for the theatre would rather have the full Broadway crew cast for the film but for this to work on a more commercial level, you must have some well known actors. Okay, so they can't carry out the songs with the power and intensity of stage performers but you've got to say they did reasonably well considering. <br/><br/>The way I see it, for someone like myself who doesn't read books and just thoroughly enjoys film, it's really opened my mind and has given me more motivation now to go to the theatre, more than I ever would before. Like I say it's a bridge between Hollywood and Broadway that I feel works very well. Hats off to the cast who really made this film what it is. Although it may look a bit of an outcast compared to the rest of my collection, this will be one Blu ray I'll be buying very soon.<br/><br/>PS. To the reviewer who said that it's ridiculous to get 19 years for stealing bread, had you have been paying attention, you'd know that he was given 5 years for stealing and the rest of his time given was for trying to escape. Please get your facts right before submitting your nonsense. You just end up looking daft."
"benladams","4","24","51","27 December 2012"," So Utterly Disappointing
","You guys....... I was so disappointed with Les Mis. Like, utterly.<br/><br/>Where to begin.....<br/><br/>Things I liked: 1) Eddie Redmayne. His was the standout performance. While anyone could have played a bashful, smiling Brit in ""My Week With Marilyn,"" Eddie actually brought talent to this role. <br/><br/>2) Anne Hathaway. Yes. I know. I never thought I'd say that I liked her in a movie. Let's face it: Meryl and Stanley made ""Devil Wears Prada,"" and any teeny-bopper could have been an accidental princess, but Anne's vocal talent and physical commitment to this particular role made the difference.<br/><br/>3) Russel Crowe. Maybe it's because I had such low expectations for him going in, but he was significantly more musically accurate than Hugh Jackman. Sure, he doesn't have the lungs for the lines he has to belt at times, but at least he seemed to be able to carry a tune.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like (Or, ""The Endless List""): 1) Hugh Jackman. Would it have killed you to sing a note? Really. It's a musical. What if Nikki Blonsky had muttered her way through ""Good Morning Baltimore"" or if Christian Bale had turned ""Santa Fe"" into a soliloquy? What a disappointment. He sang maybe 40% of the notes and only got about 60% of those right. Oh yes, and he murdered ""Bring Him Home."" That's unforgivable.<br/><br/>2) Tom Hooper. I understand that you wanted freedom for your actors to actually act while they sing, but, see above: it's a musical. At some point you have to keep them to the score.<br/><br/>3) Tom Hooper II. Would it have killed you to give an establishing shot? There was one of the ship at the beginning, some pretty landscape shots, and then one at the end with the barricade. But none of the close-quarters scenes where it actually matters.<br/><br/>4) Tom Hooper III. What on earth were you doing zooming in and out incessantly in the same shot?!<br/><br/>5) Tom Hooper IV. Now we know why people lip-synch to a pre-recorded track in a musical. Because it actually sounds good.<br/><br/>6) Tom Hooper V. When the barricade is completely surrounded, how are the revolutionaries only being attacked from one side?<br/><br/>7) Tom Hooper VI. Since when do canon balls only make some feathers fly around? If you're gonna bring in the canons, at least show some carnage.<br/><br/>8) Tom Hooper VII. How were you showing hundreds of people singing but only piping through the audio of about 20 voices? Seriously underwhelming. Note for (God help us) the next time: make the music and the voices louder than the ambient sound (e.g. waves, breeze, my own heartbeat - which was very slow because it was broken).<br/><br/>9) Amanda Seyfried. Let's face it: her vibrato sounds like she's sitting on an idling Harley. It's not pleasant. Yeah, she may have hit the high notes cleanly (except at the end of ""Do You Hear the People Sing"" where she was at least two steps flat), but her voice is weak on its best day.<br/><br/>There's so, so much more. This had such great potential. I'm counting down the days until the remake."
"bbshopbass87","6","23","49","17 December 2012"," Not awful but not great
","I've read the other user reviews that have been written so far (as of Dec. 17) and I think some people don't really understand what they are reviewing. It's a film adaptation of a hugely successful stage musical. For those who don't like the pacing or the storyline or characters, they didn't develop them past how they are written in the stage version. Stage musicals don't have as much development as film, but that's not to say there's no development what-so-ever. It's just differently in musicals.<br/><br/>That being said: Hugh Jackman does an amazing job as Jean ValJean. While I don't agree with all the vocal techniques he used, he makes the character his own; which is a huge undertaking considering the originator of the role, Colm Wilkinson, plays the Bishop of Digne.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe grew on me as time went on, I personally prefer Philip Quast of the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast version of the show.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried's voice is plain awful and she was used solely on the fact that she's somewhat of a name. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also give underwhelming performances and are cast based off of name recognition only.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway is way too dramatic for this role. Her voice is nice, but her physical emotion overpowers the emotion created by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil. Same goes for Eddie Redmayne's rendition of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" The ones who nail their characters are Aaron Tveit and Samantha Barks, which is no surprise since they come from theatre backgrounds. They truly understand what it takes to break down a song and truly emote through the music.<br/><br/>As stated in my one line summary: it's not awful, but not great. If you go into this expecting just a film or expecting the stage version you'll be disappointed. It's an adaptation, a flawed one at that. However, it is nice to see that musicals are slowly starting to make it back into the mainstream.<br/><br/>So thank you Tom Hooper for doing this project and having the cast sing live. It's just too bad that your cinematography kills the emotion that Schonberg and Boublil's stage version has mastered for the last 27 years."
"beccabookworm11","4","16","32","6 January 2013"," No, just...No
","I saw this in theatres and I didn't like it. They got a great cast, and the acting was good, but there's only so much that can be done for bad scores, cinematography and editing choices.<br/><br/>Whenever a character is singing, the camera will zoom into their face and only their face. There's only so much that one can look at Russel Crowe's face before they loose interest in the movie. There's no broken shots or interesting things that they do while singing that could improve how they look or develop the plot. At least half and hour of the 2 1/2 movie was facial shots.<br/><br/>Also, almost all of the movie was singing, and while that's all well and good for the big pieces. ""Do You Hear The People Sing"" and ""Castle on a Cloud"" are great but it gets annoying when Jean sings to Gavroche about receiving a letter, or Mme. Thénadier sings about how Cosette better fetch some water and the instrumental is in unison with the vocals. It makes the singing boring and both the acting and the movie would be better if it had been spoken.<br/><br/>On top of that, some of the actors can sing well (Hathaway, Seyfried) but others obviously don't sing, other than for this movie and it shows (Jackman and Crowe). Russel Crowe can not sing high enough for the music and can't emote while singing. His face is even blank for most of his close ups! Hugh Jackman's voice is abrasive at some points and weak in others and way to much vibrato. Eddie Redmayne is passable and Thénardier is pretty good, but it's obvious that no one other than Helena Bottom Carter (who did the best with what she had) had ever been in, or should be in a musical.<br/><br/>There was no nuance or character development. You know that Jean Valjean was a slave for stealing bread, then a mayor/factory owner and then a father on the run, but you don't get an idea of his character other than that he's a nice guy. Apparently, Javert has absolutely nothing to do with his life other than chase after one man who missed his parole almost 15 years ago for no reason other than to make Valjean's life miserable. Marius has no character at all. He ""falls in love"" and then goes to fight, threatens to blow up the barricade and then gets shot.<br/><br/>The movie was not engaging. After the fifth time with only Hugh Jackman to look at on screen, I ended up looking at the audience rather than the screen... Not a good sign.<br/><br/>There was also the typical musical element. Meeting eyes across a crowded street does not mean that someone is in love. That's lust, at most, because literally all they know about each other is that they're pretty and moderately wealthy (How are they wealthy? Valjean ran away from his job and didn't have any papers. There's no way that they should be wealthy enough to actually give away money). That does not satisfy me. There's no romance in that, especially considering that their lives were apparently reborn form that one glance and this is supposed to be romance.<br/><br/>The story is boring, and lacking in detail. The writers obviously tried to cram every plot point of several subplots into the movie, but none of the fluff and relaxed bits that makes movies and books bearable. Every moment is tense and relevant so there is no point in the movie where you can sit and digest, other than the face shots. Every relationship has been short changed. Why would Valjean take in Fantine's kid? As far as he knows, she's pretty much a random prostitute who lost her job and has a kid. There's got to be hundreds of orphans in Paris, probably less well off than Cosette who at least gets fed. Why is Éponine in the movie at all other than to tell Marius that Cosette is gone, seeing as she does nothing else other than complain about Marius being in love with somebody else? Does Javert really have nothing in his life other than chase one particular criminal? (Also, Valjean saves his life, and then he kills himself? Really?). What's so important about Marius other than that he's ""in love"" with Cosette and that he survives? How did Valjean go from ""dangerous slave"" to ""respected mayor? How did Valjean go from being in a carriage to England to being in an apartment within running distance of the barricade? You could tell that the actors were doing all that they could to emote and generally make this look interesting, and they all looked great. The visuals (other than the excessive face shot) were amazing and the lengths that some of the actor went for this movie are pretty amazing (Anne Hathaway). The Thénardiers were really fun and well played, and probably the only characters with a convincing motive.<br/><br/>All in all, not really worth seeing or the rating it got."
"richwgriffin-227-176635","10","12","23","26 December 2012"," Excellent movie musical
","Instead of stating the things that others have said I would like to offer some impressions of the movie after my first viewing today. I was surprised by how much I loved the second half (1832) of the movie, mainly because I loved the performances by Samantha Barks (Eponine), Eddie Redmayne (Marius), Amanda Seyfried (Cosette - the single best singing voice of the cast), and Aaron Tveit (Enroljas). I also loved Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Sasha Boren Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and Colm Wilkinson, among others. The cast is particularly strong.<br/><br/>Most of the visual choices are excellent; a few scenes are shot too grandly, particularly early on, but this is a minor infraction. One has to allow for musicals to have different rules than dramas or comedies, so the ""love at first sight"" aspect of the relationship between Marius and Cosette is part of musical tradition.<br/><br/>The criticisms I keep reading and hearing proved to be false: Russell Crowe's singing voice is fine, just not as strong as others in the cast; the close-ups work well for the songs; the ""dirt on the fingernails"" approach is appropriate for this particular story.<br/><br/>The 1934 French film by Raymond Bernard remains the definitive version; 4 hours and 41 minutes allows for the whole story to unfold, and it is of course the most FRENCH of the versions. But this version is now my #2 movie version, largely because the cast performs brilliantly and the songs are so memorable.<br/><br/>As for Oscars, I hope this film gets some major nominations, not only picture, Actor (Hugh Jackman), and supporting actress (Anne Hathaway), but I would like for Tom Hooper's direction and the performances by Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne to get nominations as well.

","I have never been able to comprehend what anybody hears in this ""musical."" The score is a trite, repetitious, uninspired and unmemorable collection of chords that go nowhere and say nothing. For as many times as I have heard and seen this show, none of its music sticks in my mind's ear...and I say that as a musician. Ask me to hum a few bars of this aria or the other, and I can't. It's THAT unmemorable. The limited musical vocabulary of the composer(s) of this score is truly frightening.<br/><br/>The score imagines itself to be more like an opera than a musical as every single line of dialog and ""song"" is intoned. I say ""intoned"" rather than ""sung,"" because song - from which singing derives - requires a melodic line which rises and falls, and which reinforces the text being sung. Much of Le Mis is sung on a single tone, extended speech, as it were, that grows boring in very quick order. It's like a trip to an old Roman Catholic church where all of the monks were unfortunately monotones. I have visions of the composer writing a single note as a placeholder for 15 pages of music, with the idea that he'll come back later and write the actual melody...only he never did!<br/><br/>This music is ghastly stuff! It's The Emperor's New Clothes in musical guise. To quote Gertrude Stein, ""there's no there there"" when it comes to the music.<br/><br/>And so along comes this movie which drops this horrible, uninteresting score into the hands of a bevy of actors who couldn't sing ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" were a gun put to their heads. There is more awful singing per minute in this movie than in any other musical in history. Much has been made of the director insisting that his actors actually sing their intonations on set, rather than syncing to a prerecorded soundtrack. BAD IDEA, because what we as an audience get to witness are the contortions and physical agonies many of these ""singers"" go through to emit the simplest of musical thought. This is not art. This is the amateur hour, a hack show of, well, epic proportions. <br/><br/>Singers who actually know how to sing ""give their all"" NOT through convoluted and obviously painful and visible tensions in the throat and body, but by having a singing technique that allows them to produce their basic sound freely, with emotion and drama added to what is, in fact, a balanced and easily produced sound. Of course, the masses see this physical distress as a singer ""giving their all,"" rather than what it actually is - ie: a singer struggling against themselves to produce the effect they desire. Can one imagine admiring an athlete for whom simply putting one foot in front of the other in a foot race was the hardest thing to do in life? No, we'd say ""that person is an amateur who hasn't a clue as to what it means to run a race."" Yet in this 2012 version of Les Mis, we are supposed to praise amateurs for their INABILITY to sing. Pathetic.<br/><br/>But does it matter? The truth is that one could drop the finest singers in history into this ""musical,"" and they would still be stuck performing the musical equivalent of singing the phone book.<br/><br/>Dreadful, dreadful stuff. The stuff of adult nightmares, in fact.<br/><br/>Were there a ""zero"" rating available, I'd give it to this turkey."
"werefox08","3","14","28","26 December 2012"," This is where More................really means Les Miz.
","I have seen Les Miserables 3 times as a stage musical. Each time it got a 10...15 minute standing ovation. Many people were crying. I have also read the novel by Victor Hugo (1862). This was a brave attempt by Director Tom Hooper to blend the musical into a sprawling epic film. And so near Oscar time...what a coincidence. When two of the leading characters don't do ""there thing"", then it is a struggle. Russell Crowe is simply mis-cast as Javert. His singing voice is not good enough. And--he makes a one dimensional character into a half dimensional one. Amanda Seyfried as Cosette is ....well lets be kind....not good. Her relationship with Marius (Eddie Redmayne) is like two frozen peas trying to get frisky. The cinematography is ""experimental ?"" . Like pushing a hand held camera into the singers faces at all key moments. Anne Hathaway will win the Oscar for best supporting actress...and that is fair. Hugh Jackman will probably win for best actor...but playing Jean Valjean is to carry a heavy load. His use of different singing techniques for each song was a wrong decision...disorientating the audience. I feel he saw this as a huge Oscar chance...and went for it. Perhaps....like some beaten athletic runners..he saw the winning post too soon. (some scenes did look hurried...) Certainly... here in Australia ...this has been hyped savagely. Two Australian actors in a huge frenzied ""epic"" !!!!!. Hype is a strange beast...you enter the cinema WANTING to keep in step with ""public opinion"". So...you walk out happy. If you want to get the real Les Mis.....See it live on stage. (no hype required)"
"skwillcox","4","8","14","30 December 2012"," Epic Movie in Oh So Many Ways
","Everyone must see this epic movie, even if they do not like musicals. My wife and daughter talked me into going to the Les Mis play at the Fox Theater in St Louis a few months ago. Further encouragement came from the memory that the most literary minded man I ever knew, a very well read old judge, long ago pronounced his judgment that Victor Hugo's Les Miserables was ""the best novel ever written."" I never finished the tome-like book, but loved the play - becoming a real fan. So, when I heard about the movie version, and was exposed to Anne Hathaway's emotional and terrific rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in the pre-release trailer and promotions I could not hardly wait to see it. I was not the only one. Several days after Christmas, my wife, daughter, mother, mother in law, sister, brother-in-law and I went to see it at a local theater. Everyone in the family loved this epic drama. They and the rest of the movie audience even applauded at the end. I have been a Russell Crowe, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway fan for some time and they, especially Anne, exceeded even my lofty expectations. Now I have become a Hugh Jackman fan, too. I Love Sally Field, I Really Love Her, but Anne Hathaway's performance in this movie, with heart-rending acting and singing, was perfection. If she does not win an Oscar, it will be a travesty of epic proportions. She would have stolen the show in Les Miserables completely like she surprisingly did with The Dark Knight Rises, except for the exceptional performance by Jackman as Jean Valjean. Give him an Oscar, too. (Poor Daniel Day Lewis. He also deserves an academy award. How about a tie?) I apparently liked Russell Crowe better than many. Javert is an extremely hard role to play opposite the heroic Jean Valjean. Crowe is one of the few with the kind of acting talent, strength and dominating spirit needed for the part. But, except for ""conversational"" singing and the superb solo near the end, I would agree his ""live"" singing under Director Hooper's revolutionary guidelines (pun not intended) was not as effortless as it was for Hathaway, Jackman, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, and others."
"spacemanspiff77-1","10","8","14","30 December 2012"," A Grand Triumph
","In a Hollywood where nothing is new anymore, where nothing takes the leap to be called innovative or original, I have finally found a movie I am proud to call both innovative and original. Tom Hooper's Les Misérables is based on the stage musical, which in turn is based on Victor Hugo's epic 19 century novel. As a critic who has had the privilege of reading this epic, I had high expectations for Hooper's film adaptation. This film takes a chance and decides to finally do something new.<br/><br/>The movie was filmed with two major risks involved: first, the actors were to sing live on set, and second, Hooper did not use film transitions, rather he devised a new way of editing I have never seen before in which the cuts are not transitions, rather they follow the songs and the emotions of the characters. Both of the risks paid off triumphantly and the audience is treated to a version of Hugo's classic that could not have been told any other way. For the first time ever we get both the famous songs and the riveting emotions of the characters singing them. Hooper's major cinematic tool was the close-up, which he used flawlessly to capture every single eye twitch and half smile; powerful images that cannot be found from a nosebleed seat.<br/><br/>With that in mind, the most powerful aspect of the film is its images. Some of these images will haunt your memories, while others will hold on to your heart. Each camera angle, each set piece is used to create a painting. Some brush strokes emulate misery, while others signify redemption. The entire cast paints a portrait of what we find in Hugo's classic.<br/><br/>The singing is superb, from each cast member. Hugh Jackman sings a touching ""Bring Him Home,"" Russel Crowe sings a rousing ""Stars,"" and Anne Hathaway will break your heart with ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Even Samantha Barks in her film debut brings acting on par with that of the former when she flawlessly moves you with ""On My Own."" The emotions brought forth by the actors are often more powerful than the songs themselves. Each cast member is an actor first, singer second, which allows the film its significance and independence from the stage.<br/><br/>From the first sequence to the final number, Hooper entices you with a poetic journey through Hugo's redemptive tale. This is easily the best film of the year and one of this critic's all time favorite films. It will stay with you, whether you want it to or not. You will cry, you will laugh, and I promise you, even if you do not know the songs when you enter the theater, you will sing.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jdesando","Null","8","14","18 December 2012"," It's a joy.
","Jean Valjean: ""I stole a loaf of bread. My sister's child was close to death, and we were starving."" Javert: ""And you will starve again unless you learn the meaning of the law!"" <br/><br/>Just as I stood at the end of the stage production of Les Miserables, I stood in my home after watching a screener copy. I was, however, concerned that I would have nothing ""critical' to say about director Tom Hooper's lush film version, filled with first-rate actors believable crowds, and singing befitting non-opera types in a people's opera. <br/><br/>Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), mayor of Paris in the first part of the 19th century, promises dying prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway) to take care of her daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). He has been eluding the tireless policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe), after breaking parole for the crime of stealing a loaf of bread, for which he served 19 years. It's not so much the melodrama that grabs me as the inspired music that has discernibly distinct and luscious melodies and a book that straightforwardly tells story and reveals character. <br/><br/>Jackman, Hathaway, and Crowe are competent singers, and the better for not being opera stars, who would have compromised the Everyman feel of the musical. For an almost three hour show, Hooper and writer Claude-Michel Schonberg keep the action moving from Javert and Valjean in a battle of wits and the youths fomenting a revolution right outside the windows. <br/><br/>For comic relief, Sacha Baron Cohen as Thénardier and Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Thénardier run a comical whore house and do quite well as pickpockets. At times, their antics are so opposite the grand action outside as to be almost irritating. Les Mis was a thrill on stage; it is a joy on screen as the 19th century comes alive with the poor struggling against the rich and the noble, poor or rich, miserable."

","This story is one of Broadway's most popular musicals yet the three main actors (Jackman, Hathaway and Crowe) were horribly miscast. Why on earth the producer/director opted to go with non-professional singers is a mystery to us all other then the drawing power of Jackman and Crowe. Hathaway was the worst and out of her element and league. How sad that what might have been a Hollywood Classic for the Ages will die a quick and slow death. Do not look for this film to garner a great many nominations much less an Oscar although the only category an Oscar may be extended to is the cinematography - but even that was CGI'd to death. You want good CGI? Go see the Hobbit. You want to see Les Mis as a remarkable musical with songs sung by incredible voices? Go see it on Broadway."
"kellysmithmarketing","10","11","21","25 December 2012"," This is a must see movie!
","Remember the lousy version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" a few years ago? Les Miz is nothing like that. It is an amazing adaptation to video and one of the best movies I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Go see it. Bring enough tissues too, because you are going to need it.<br/><br/>Why should you see it? First of all the story still rings a powerful message even after all these year since it was written. I saw the Broadway play several years ago and it was wonderful. I saw a local High School version of it and liked it even better, but this film version tops them all. A story of judgement, or redemption, of love, of treating people the way we should be treated to bring out the best in all of us. A powerful message we all can relate to. <br/><br/>Next: the performances are astounding. I don't understand why they are criticizing some of the performances because for the first time ever, all the songs are recorded just as you see them. They are not lip-syncing anything and this presents a real treat, a raw and emotion laden touch to it all. <br/><br/>Then there is the astounding photography to it all that is not all green-screened (although some it). Its one thing to read a book where the pictures are created in your mind and another one to watch someone else's creation of that same information. Because there have been so many versions of this over the years (including other movies) the use of the latest in technology really adds some amazing things to it all. <br/><br/>Lastly, the music and the score. It is wonderfully done and never gets old. <br/><br/>Go see this movie. It doesn't have a single comic book super hero or alien transformer in site! It has a powerful story that will change the way you see life."
"levochka","3","13","26","23 January 2013"," Hollywood at its best - ruining the great musical
","Being in love with the actual Les Mis musical, and having seen it 5 times on Broadway I was disappointed with the movie adaptation. Here are the list of really irritating things in the movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>Singing while sobbing and crying - Seriously, every other song is sung through tears. At some point instead of sympathizing with the character, you want to kill him or her for ruining the song. Can you guys cry first, and then sing? This is a musical - songs are important!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Too many closeups - I don't understand the reason behind showing an actor's face occupying 2/3 of the screen (and we're talking large screen in the movie theater) and blurring the background. Especially when the character is moving and the only thing we see is again the giant face. Should be great for dentists but for the rest of us, it's just annoying.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Way too much suffering effects throughout the movie. Everyone suffers all the time. Cheap special effects are used to intensify the suffering - why is there always rain and their faces wet, why are they always crying? It's the audience that should cry out of sympathy. Instead, most of the time their artificial suffering is laughable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The set and placement of the actors. This musical should not be about showing off the set. Why show three-tiered barrier in the water, why walk around the gargoyles, why those telescopic shots that zoom up in the sky? Do we actually need all those ships in the beginning? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Music quality. This is a musical. Almost all of the lines are sung - singing should be taken seriously. Compare this to the ""25th anniversary of Les Mis in concert"" and you'll see that every song is performed significantly worse then the concert production. If your actors can't sing, hire different actors. Their sex appeal is not that important here.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, major disappointment. Wishing the musical production to be back."
"rbontrager","4","13","26","2 January 2013"," Shaky camera and poor editing
","I wanted to like this film, but the director decided NOT to budget in a Steadicam for the majority of shots. Instead we get LONG closeups with very shaky camera work in the face of some amazing singing performances. The shaking camera is so distracting it really killed the movie for me. Also a distraction was the poor editing. Many of the cuts were randomly thrown together with very little motivation. The ""Master Of The House"" musical number is almost unwatchable where the shaking camera and fast distracting edits makes it very difficult to figure out what's going on. But everyone on screen puts forth a strong effort. Unfortunately it's the filmmakers who shot and edited the film who make, what appears, first-year-film-student mistakes and ruin the movie. Sad."
"pvpluta","2","13","26","28 December 2012"," Boring
","The entire movies was sung, and quite horribly by some of the actors. In several recent successful musical to theater translations, the directors have done a great job of adapting the play/musical while retaining the integrity of a MOVIE. After a bout a half hour of nothing but singing, at times too quickly to understand the lyrics, leavings gaps in the storyline (if you have not seen the play/musical). This is simply a filming of a musical with better sets. 5 minutes in I was ready to leave. Simply put, if you want to see Les Mis, go see the musical. If you want to see a translation of Les Mis into a movie, wait 20 years for a remake. 2stars because great storyline."
"oz-marky","2","13","26","27 December 2012"," Just Miserable
","Firstly, I want to know how this film is getting praise? The most popular stage musical in history with an audience of over 60 million patrons has finally been filmed 27 years after it's first staging in London. It has been recorded in many languages and twice filmed as a concert, and so the expectations ran high. It didn't deliver! The songs have been re-written, re-ordered or cut completely. The Prologue is abridged giving little idea of back story or character. The music is subdued and singing gives way to speaking. Hugh Jackman sings at the top of his range for the entire film, Russell Crowe can't sing at all and appears as if he is aware of the fact; distracting when he is supposed to be a domineering character. He murders Stars; one of the great songs of the show. There is no light relief as Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter play the least amusing or threatening Thenardiers possible. Hard to ruin Master of the House but they succeed. The ABC Cafe setting is gone, and so we have no idea who the students are or why they're rebelling. Eponine's character has been reduced considerably. One Day More was placed after On My Own and instead of bringing the characters together, they separate leaving the ""big"" number without it's rousing finale. All reprises of Look Down are gone including Turning as well as Dog Eat Dog and the Thenardiers comedy song at the wedding. The singing is live, which in this case doesn't help. The only high point for me in this sleep-inducing endless monotony, was Anne Hathaway as Fantine. Her performance and singing are superb, even as she is singing I Dreamed a Dream after, her hair, and in this case teeth as well, have been sold. Boring beyond belief, I can't believe that anyone who knows the show well, could possibly enjoy this overwrought film version. The biggest disappointment in 30 years. Reviewers who are saying how close to the stage production this is, are deluded."
"bkoganbing","9","7","12","6 May 2013"," ""The People Shall Be Free""
","I've said many times to friends when I hear about certain projects like adapting Les Miserables as a musical I'm usually skeptical. Then as often as not I'm proved wrong and I'm happy to say I was proved wrong here. Les Miserables is far more than a musical, it has the same epic quality that dramatic film versions I've seen, most particularly the 1935 film with Fredric March and Charles Laughton. <br/><br/>As for the musical score the only show I can compare with this is Porgy And Bess, a much simpler story on not so broad a canvass, but still with an epic quality. Both Les Miserables and Porgy And Bess slip ever so surreptitiously into a category of music some might call opera. In another century Les Miserables might very well be labeled an opera.<br/><br/>And it's interesting in that the leads are done and well by a pair of non-singers Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean and his tormentor Inspector Javert played by Russell Crowe. Neither are exactly trained voices, but they get the musical score delivered. Hugh Jackman got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, the film for Best Picture and a flock of other nominations for technical categories.<br/><br/>And it brought a Best Supporting Actress Award to Anne Hathaway as the tragic Fantine. I always thought Anne was overlooked when she played Jake Gyllenhaal's wife in Brokeback Mountain, that she should have been nominated that year. Nice to see the Academy made it up to her this year. <br/><br/>The success of Les Miserables on Broadway and in film once again shows that there is indeed a market for the classics when they're intelligently made. Besides Anne Hathaway, Les Miserables took home Oscars for Sound and for Makeup. It seems to have an appeal for folks in my age bracket who went to school in the Sixties. The revolutionary ardor of the students fomenting rebellion in the years of Orleanist France seems to strike a familiar note with those who marched in protests. Even so with young people today who like to identify with the young of that era in France lost in a cause much bigger than their own individual lives are.<br/><br/>And I think it will be so in the future."
"elena-papalexopoulou","10","7","12","3 February 2013"," I can't stop thinking about it!
","To me, Les Miserables, is one of the best if not the best musicals ever. I love it, the songs, the story, the plot, everything. So I was waiting so much to see it. In Greece it is not out yet, so it was a good thing I went to London a week ago. <br/><br/>I thought the direction was superb, scenery and cinematography too. Sometimes the settings were a bit claustrophobic in that the buildings were too close together. The duration of the film was just right I think, but they took out ""Little People"" which is my favorite and I was so sad about it!! I understand that of they left everything in, the film would have been 3 hours long.. but Little People, Out???<br/><br/>In terms of the cast. Hugh Jackman was superb! So convincing, and vulnerable and tormented soul, this is so beautifully depicted in the version of the musical. His voice was also very good, must say i was a bit surprised. I would love to see him win an Oscar for this performance despite the odds leaning towards Daniel Day Lewis. Anne Hathaway as Fantine was also very good, she has received a lot of publicity for this films, on one hand rightly so on the other she is a tiny bit overrated if you ask me. Russel Crowe was also good, he has a different type of voice, but still I liked it and I am sorry that people feel he was not good. As an actor he is not strong on pronouncing clearly his words and i think this is even more evident on a musical while he sings but for the role of Javair he was good, solid. Marius was also really good and he has a fantastic voice, very strong and soft at the same time. For me Amanda Seyfried was a disappointment. Her voice was so high pitched that I thought it can't go any higher without actual screaming! <br/><br/>The most brilliant thing of all, was how the singing happened together with the acting and this was amazing. It spoiled a bit my tendency to sing the songs as I have learned to sing the musical as I have seen it, and now there are no pauses in the songs, as it is incorporated in the acting - but this was so refreshing, it gave the film a whole different perspective to it, a new edge! I can't wait for the film to be released in the theaters in Greece so that I can take my daughter and my mum to go and see it. I will leave the lads behind. Mind you I will chose a matinée viewing in order to avoid crowds. I really want to enjoy it again."

","I don't usually write reviews, but then again, I never really watch movies adhering to these two criteria: recent and EPIC. Yes, I haven no qualms in admitting outright and unabashedly that this has been one of the best movie going experiences for me. (And this is coming from someone who has seen most of the movies here on the IMDb top 250 list). Going into the movie I had no idea of what it was, but since the first scene (which was amazing, and when I realized that Russel Crowe, one of my favorite actors was in it) it had me hooked right up until the last and this is really something considering the GIGANTIC duration of the movie compared to what we get these days. And it even made me shed a few tears right in the end and it was around this time when I was completely sure that this movie was going down as one of the all time classics I'll ever see in my life. I've never really had much of a taste for musicals (having turned off half way through Sweeney Todd), but this was something else completely. Intelligent writing and epic settings and the entire story was brilliant. I'm not familiar with the original piece of literature but I am quite sure that it must have been a helluva of a creation by Victor Hugo if this is what it's celluloid representation looks like. I'm pretty sure whatever money went into the making of this movie (and it must have been a LOT considering on how it turned out) was well used. Hugh Jackman was inspirational in this. Russell Crowe, although I felt was somewhat of a disappointment (in that he (in my eyes) fell short in displaying the cruel, ruthless and duty bound leader Javert) still speaks volumes.. I mean, how can a movie be bad when it's weakest character is still ten times better and more identifiable than the strongest characters we get in your average run of the mill movies these days?. As for Anne Hathaway's character, she was a revelation... she completely justified her role and was absolutely perfect, I have no doubt that this was the best performance of her career. Also, I can't leave without speaking about another guy in the movie.... Imagine my surprise when halfway through it, one my favorite comedy artist turned up.. yeah, that's right... it's Sacha Baron Cohen, and boy did he live up to his expectations, he and Helena completely provided the comedic relief necessary in this EPIC venture. I really loved how all the other actors too played their parts. I have nothing but praise for the director and the producers, clearly it was a job well done on the part of the whole team, seeing as how this turned out. All in all I LOVED this movie and will definitely watch it again and again!. 10/10. Recommended."
"regienaldg-283-237153","10","7","12","19 January 2013"," The most provocative and dramatic musical movie that keeps you crying until the end
","Les Miserables is a very powerful and dramatic movie that depicts pain, grief, sacrifices, suffering, hate, and love. It is an excellent movie that it was nominated in 8 categories in the 85th Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Watching Les Miserables in the cinema is a totally different experience. Once you step inside the movie house and the tapes started rolling, it's like you are transported back to the 1800's inside a French house while watching the events happening outside through your window. You see what the characters see. You feel what the characters feel. In fact, you have to have strong emotions when you go see this movie because it is so provocative you will be crying until the end. When I saw this movie there was one thing I had to battle with. Aside from the cold due to the air conditioner which was actually tolerable I didn't have any problem with it, I had to keep holding back my tears. It wasn't as easy as it sounded because there was never a moment in this movie where your emotions were not moved. Surely, the scene where Fantine sings ""I Dreamed A Dream"" must be one of the most memorable moments not only of this movie but in the history of all movies. However I was particularly struck when Jean Valjean sings to himself that Cosette is not his to keep and that he has to let go. At that moment, I pictured myself as a father and the time comes that I have to let go of my sweet girl I have treasured my whole life. This must be a very dramatic event in a person's life as much as the movie is.<br/><br/>The characters all did an outstanding performance but I must give the highest credits obviously to Hugh Jackman who not only gave a realistic portrayal of the melancholic Jean Valjean but who carried the story very well to the end, and to of course Anne Hathaway who had a brief but very pivotal role as Fantine. Until I watched this film, I thought Hugh Jackman is not a strong contender for Best Actor in the Oscars. Now I will not be surprised if he beats 2-time Best Actor Daniel Day-Lewis. This is by far Jackman's most powerful role yet. Hathaway will no doubt win the Best Supporting Actress award. Another underrated character is that of Russell Crowe's Javert. Although he was not my personal favorite for the role- I actually believe he is not perfect for the role, Crowe nevertheless played the villain so perfectly I was made to believe that he was a real-life villain. I almost wanted to go inside the screen and push him off the edge of the bridge myself to end his misery. There were comedic moments of the movie as well, thanks to the amusing Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter. Amanda Seyfried, Samantha Barks, and the rest of the cast all did an outstanding job. The actors' performances were one of the best and they brought life to and lived up to the title Les Miserables- The Miserable Ones.<br/><br/>If other action-packed and thrilling movies keep you at the edge of your seat, this one will keep you crying until you have no more tears left. A piece of advise for moviegoers who haven't seen this movie yet: Bring an extra hanky."
"3xHCCH","10","7","12","17 January 2013"," A Perfect Cinematic Version of a Broadway Musical
","This film faithfully follows the story flow of the musical theater hit by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil. This musical had so many well-loved songs and they were all here. Director Tom Hooper employed a very striking close-up shots of most of these very dramatic, heart- rending musical performances. It is well-publicized that Hooper also required his stars to be actually singing live during the take, and this fact makes the performances all the more amazing. It was also very good that they had added certain details from the original novel by Victor Hugo (like Fantine selling her teeth or meeting Marius' grandfather) to further enhance this version.<br/><br/>The trailer already showed us the haunting rendition of Anne Hathaway of Fantine's ""I Dreamed a Dream."" But what we see in the actual film, is Anne singing it in stark close-up, in one long single take, while tears were flowing down her cheeks. This was perfection! Her Golden Globe win, Oscar nomination and likely win is absolutely deserved.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman had a larger than life screen presence. I cannot imagine any other Hollywood star who has the physical and vocal attributes appropriate for the demanding role of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who spends his lifetime trying to make up for the sins of his past. Hugh is already an Tony-award winning musical theater star so his singing credentials cannot be questioned. His Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination for this film is also well-deserved. I would even go out on a limb and say that Hugh's performance as Valjean is more emotionally- stirring than Daniel Day-Lewis' was in ""Lincoln."" I want him to win that Oscar.<br/><br/>The third member of the cast that I was most impressed with was Eddie Redmayne who played Marius. After watching and hearing him perform the shows most romantic and stirring songs like ""A Heart Full of Love"", ""A Little Fall of Rain"" and most especially, ""Empty Chairs and Empty Tables,"" I was really surprised that he did not receive any awards consideration at all. He was really very good as the young romantic lead. He had good chemistry with both the fair Cossette (Amanda Siefried) and the tragic Eponine (Samantha Barks).<br/><br/>Many critics have been hard on Russell Crowe and his singing. It was not really that bad though, though his versions of ""Stars"" and ""Javert's Suicide"" were not exactly what we expect from stage performances. It is of course not fair to judge it this way since acting style would be different in stage and screen. <br/><br/>The vibrant cinematography, the production design, the costumes all effectively capture the squalor and turmoil of Paris during the French Revolution, all fully deserving of awards as well. OK, being a theater geek, and I may be biased. But now that I have seen all nine nominees, in all fairness I can declare that ""Les Miserables"" is the most deserving movie for that Oscar Best Picture grand prize!"
"sclvr","10","7","12","13 January 2013"," Great version of a great piece of work
","When I heard about this movie coming out, I was really excited. I play in a lot of community theater orchestra pits (I'm a cellist), and I was blessed with the opportunity to play this musical with a very good youth theater group a couple of years ago. Wow, what a great piece of work this musical is. It's an emotional roller coaster to play - parts of it make you tear up so much that it's hard to read the music - LOL. I tend to make kind of a personal bond with certain musicals I've played, and this is one of those (others being Cabaret, Brigadoon, Music Man, West Side Story, and Promises, Promises). This movie version of Les Miserables is really good. The performances are great, especially Hathaway, Jackman, and Daniel Huttlestone (the kid - he was GREAT - it made me cry when Javert pinned the medal on his body). Nods also go to Russell Crowe, who is ALWAYS very good, but had a surprisingly good voice in this film. I feel bad for not mentioning all of the leads - all of them are very good. The younger generation (Cosette and her friends) are all very good - I already knew of Amanda Syfried from other films, but hadn't seen Marius before (Eddie Redmayne) - he was great. I had seen Samantha Barks play Eponine before...her big song in this movie made me lose it. Wow. If you like musicals, this is a must see."
"ihopetherespudding","8","7","12","12 January 2013"," One of the best films in a long time.
","In my opinion,Les Miserables is a lot like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. Both didn't live up to my full hype but I could see why there was such a hype. Les Miserables is a big movie adapted from a big musical adapted from a big book and it shows. Granted,it's not the best film that I have ever seen but it's definitely going to stick in my mind.The scale of it was amazing, the songs were really good,if not a bit tedious after a while and the casting was pretty much perfect. Some highlights include Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche, Samantha Barks as Eponine and Sacha Baren Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenadiers. The Thenadiers make this movie, I don't think I have laughed that much at a movie in a long time and I would happily pay the price of admission and watch it again just to see them. As for the flaws that everyone else has complained of,they didn't bother me. The angles weren't that distracting and Russell Crowe actually has a decent singing voice on him, compared to the others in the cast,it does sound out of place but if he was in something like Jesus Christ Superstar,then it would sound a lot better. Overall, Les Miserables is a musical unlike the usual type and is definitely worth a watch."
"DICK STEEL","9","7","12","26 December 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Les Miserables
","Director Tom Hooper charges ahead from his Oscar winner The King's Speech, with an ambitious adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, a story that has had countless of musical staging, with most people holding dear to their favourite interpretation of characters and scenes. Boasting a stellar star studded A-list ensemble, Hooper's version has ingredients that makes it Academy Awards contender, although the challenge may seem to be getting audiences to embrace this glossy version made for the screen, which is never easy for something that's been around for more than three decades.<br/><br/>Set in 19th century France spanning decades, we follow the life story of the thief Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) through his time under duress serving hard labour under the watchful eyes of cop Javert (Russell Crowe), the latter adamant that the ol' leopard can never change its spots during the former's parole, only for Jean to be touched by religion when he was forgiven, and given a new lease of life to do good. And I guess you probably know the drill by now, that Jean goes on to be a successful businessman, still being pursued by Javert, encounters Fantine (Anne Hathaway) whom he saves, which the story going into the second chapter of saving Fantine's daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen), before making another quantum leap when Cosette, now played by Amanda Seyfried, discovers true romance with Marius (Eddie Redmayne), who is part of the student leaders on the cusp of launching another revolution.<br/><br/>It's pretty much of an endurance marathon sitting through close to three hours, where unlike a musical or a stage play, you'd get an intermission. For starters it takes some getting used to, because every spoken word is sung (yes I know it's a musical) almost back to back, with the multitude of recognizable tunes from Work Song to Do You Hear The People Sing sung by the cast members, who have been put through singing lessons, otherwise one can guess how this would turn out if sounding less than professional. Hugh Jackman was fairly inconsistent in delivery, while Russell Crowe proved that he can't do this full time, since his Javert almost always came off quite one-note, and having a distinct lack of feel for the character. Anne Hathaway on the other hand, nailed it spot on with her I Dreamed a Dream, and is just about one of the best things in the film.<br/><br/>Film as a medium to present musicals have always been a fascinating journey, because of the characteristics that come with the medium. With film, it allows for expansive sets to be constructed, taking on a more three dimensional feel to the story telling since it's not just being on stage in front of you. Camera movement helps to provide spatial content, with jump cuts also producing an equivalent effect if necessary to move the narrative from location to location in double quick time.<br/><br/>But while the medium had opened up space, Hooper took on an intent to allow audiences a different experience, in putting us up close and personal with the performers. This is something one rarely gets in a staged musical because even the first row is a distance away. Hooper puts us just next to the characters with his plenty of close ups, that we probably get to see every facial expression and twitch as the characters express themselves through song. So once the actors open their mouths, we're put right there in the thick of the action, whether you'd like it or not. It makes for an engrossing watch, but for the quality art direction and lush production values to be appreciated, your eyes have to quickly dart around before the next musical number comes on.<br/><br/>You'd have your own personal favourite scenes from the musical, and I have three - with the three way romance between Cosette, Marius and Eponine (Samantha Barks) which is ever so brief but no less making a tremendous impact, having Jean Valjean go up against Javert in every instance to allow one to determine whether Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe would fare better than the other when they sing, and the limited scenes in which Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter make their appearance as the thieving Thenardiers, providing comic relief for the very heavy themes and story line involving one man's redemption, rivalry, tragic romance, all against the backdrop of a student led armed revolt.<br/><br/>Not having the luxury of sitting through a live stage performance of this musical, Tom Hooper has done enough to drum interest to a level high enough to want to do so when Les Miserables comes to town the next time round. Meanwhile, make do with this lavish production meant for the screen, and be immersed in a world and story as first envisioned by Victor Hugo, and adapted from the Cameron Mackintosh musical. Recommended!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","7","12","25 December 2012"," Adapted from a musical, a movie stand and falls on the songs
","and this is particularly the case of ""Les Mis"" which has virtually no spoken dialogue, relying essentially on recitatives in the style of the grand opera where spoken dialogues are needed to drive the plot. As well, all the emotions of the characters are delivered through songs. In this context, the singing ability of the cast, although perhaps not one hundred per cent essential, does count a lot. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman fares best. With a Tony musical award (2004 ""The boy from Oz"") in his resume, he has claim to best credentials in the lot. Those who don't go to live plays will still remember his riveting performance of the introductory medley in hosting the 2009 Oscar. As Jean Valjean, Jackman's singing ability richly augments his acting. The one number I was waiting for right from the beginning of the movie is ""Bring him home"". The emotional intensity is a challenge, as are the high note. Jackman in wonderful in delivering the beautiful song and the emotion behind it, which is essential to the plot later when he entrusted Cosette completely to Marius's care.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, on the other hand, is by comparison the least endowed in the department of singing, his proved acting ability notwithstanding. The part of Javert helps though, requiring no command in the higher vocal range. He does sound a bit strained at the early recitative, but handles adequately Javert's solo number ""Stars"" in its baritone range with only an occasional highest note in E. His acting ability more than makes up for whatever relative shortcoming there is in singing.<br/><br/>The biggest name in the female cast is obviously Anne Hathaway, whose appearance as Fantine is actually quite brief, as anyone who is familiar with the musical would know. And yet, her number ""I dreamed a dream"" has in the last couple of years acquired a benchmark through a once unknown name Susan Boyle. But then, Boyle's performance has taken the song entirely out of the context of the story, and therefore does not offer meaningful comparison. Hathaway has her own credentials from Broadway and delivers her solo number with profession proficiency in the singing department. In acting, it may even be good enough for a Golden Globe supporting award for which she has been nominated.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried is perhaps the next best known, from her role as Sophie in ""Mama Mia"" which she secured undoubtedly in part due to her own music academy training as a soprano. Portraying sweet and innocent Cosette is no challenge to her (you'll know what I mean if you've seen her in 2009's ""Chloe"" in the titular role). Perhaps a little surprisingly, the role teenage Cosette does not have much singing, not even her own solo number (even child Cosette has ""Castle on a cloud""). So again, no challenge for Seyfriend as she comes across captivating and lovely in the romantic duet ""A heart full of love"" with Marius. <br/><br/>For this musical, the two key male roles are labelled as ""lead"" while the three key female roles are all called ""secondary lead"". I have referred to two of them, but it's the third, Eponine, that comes closest to being THE female lead. While different in nature, Eponine's emotional demand is just as strong as Fantine's, and she has more singing than either Fantine or Cosette. As to a hit solo, Susan Boyle notwithstanding, Eponine's ""On my own"" plays no second fiddle to ""I dreamed a dream"". Personally I like it even better. Samantha Barks, hitherto little known, is absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne, who is generally known for his non-singing sort-of male lead in ""My week with Marilyn"", does not come with any exceptional musical credentials. But then he displays a beautiful lyric tenor voice right from his first appearance as Marius, and handles all the singing throughout very comfortably.<br/><br/>For the comic relief couple of dubious character, sing ability is not at the top of the list of priority and so, who can argue with casting Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Besides, it's not as if they can't sing – just watch (or listen to, rather) them in ""Sweeney Todd: The demon barber of Fleet Street"". <br/><br/>To sum up, the movie should be able to satisfy those who have enjoyed the musical on stage."
"tbmforclasstsar","8","7","12","20 December 2012"," a brilliant and moving adaptation of the award winning musical that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer this holiday season
","Let me preface this entire review with some important notes about myself. I really like musicals. Quite a bit. From an early age all the way to the present, I loved the excitement of the stage and had the pleasure of seeing shows like Phantom of the Opera, The Producers, The Lion King, Billy Elliot, Mary Poppins, Wicked, Jersey Boys, and many other shows as the national productions came to Chicago. But as far as music and sure beauty, Les Misérables was always my favorite musical. I was thrilled to see it last month when it came to the Cadillac Theatre in Chicago, and was looking forward to seeing Tom Hooper's film adaptation of the musical for quite some time.<br/><br/>This is all extremely important because Les Misérables is a film that will not resonate with everyone. This is a fact and is not a fault of the cast, crew, or director. The musical was not received well critically when it first premiered, and I would imagine this film could suffer the same problem from film critics this holiday season. It is a deep, draining, and long drama that does not give your emotions a rest from song to song and heartbreak to heartbreak. You should know that when seeing a film titled Les Misérables anyway, but in case you weren't reading the clues, it is heavy.<br/><br/>However, it will not receive a negative review from myself. On the contrary, I can do nothing but praise the film for being a bold, beautiful, and moving adaptation of what I consider to be one of the best musicals ever made. Claude-Michel Schönberg's absolutely gorgeous music transfers brilliantly to the silver screen as the power and emotion in melodies of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" ""One Day More"" ""On My Own"" and ""Bring Him Home"" will bring chills and tears to many an audience member seeing Les Misérables this holiday season.<br/><br/>Les Misérables is originally a novel by French writer Victor Hugo. The story follows Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a man who spent 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread for his dying nephew and trying to escape his capture. Upon his release from prison, he tries to begin a new life when he is taken in by a kind hearted bishop (played in the film by the original Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson). Leaving Jean Valjean behind, he is constantly hunted down by the police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) that was one of his original guards in prison. Making a new and fulfilling life for himself, Valjean is constantly haunted by his past while trying to make right the life he lives. Eventually he becomes mayor of a town and owns a factory. Here he encounters Fantine (Anne Hathaway), a young girl who turned to prostitution to pay for her child when she was fired by the foreman of Valjean's factory. Promising to care for her child when Fantine is on her death bed, Valjean devotes his life to the young Cosette (played in her adult period by Amanda Seyfried) and begins a new life with her in Paris.<br/><br/>The story continues following the life of Valjean and Cosette while bringing in the lives of a crass landlord (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his wife (Helena Bonham Carter), their daughter Eponine (Samantha Barks), and members of a revolution looking to change the way the people of France are treated by the government. The second act is filled with an explosive battle, a young love story, and the constant fight between Valjean and Javert.<br/><br/>As I stated above, the film is quite lengthy and complex and is on a pretty phenomenal scale. Being a musical that premiered over 25 years ago, we can understand why it took such a great deal of time for any director to even attempt to bring this epic to the screen. And Tom Hooper should be applauded for not only being bold enough to be the man to helm this project, but for also making some creative choices that could have ended tragically for this adaptation.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/les-miserables/"

","Les Miserables is a movie that will not be forgotten. Anyone who has seen (and enjoyed) the stage production will be engrossed in this cinema portrayal.<br/><br/>The interpretation followed stage productions very well. Casting was phenomenal- especially for Hugh Jackman, who fulfilled my image for Jean Valjean perfectly and Anne Hathaway gave a brilliant performance (along with a wonderful singing voice. The rest of the cast portrayed their characters wonderfully.<br/><br/>The scenery is undeniably a piece of art. The buildings, homes and barricade were amazingly real; costumes were completely true to that time period; makeup on the actors helped tell the story. Details (the sewer scene is an example) are one of the things that makes this movie great.<br/><br/>For anyone who enjoys musicals (I'd guess that about 70% of the movie has dialogue that is sung, yet still easily understood and followed), this movie is a must see. I cried, I laughed (oh, those Thenardiers), and I was moved (especially by the closing scene, which was gorgeous)."

","I never saw this in the theater or Broadway. But my parents have and they felt that the film was more and more in depth as it also brought beautiful scenery.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays a man who was arrested and imprisoned for nearly twenty years for stealing bread to feed a family member.

While Jackman and his grown daughter he has raised while trying to keep his past a secret from Seyfield, realizes that Crowe is not far from behind.<br/><br/>You have to see what happens next. As this film is amazing. Hathaway is only in the film for fifteen minutes and steals the scenes especially when she is cutting her hair to get money for her and her daughter.<br/><br/>Jackman is pitiful as you feel for the man. As he changes from being a man that hated the world to one that feels love and despite being a fugitive, he wants to do the right thing.<br/><br/>Crowe may be overzealous but is torn between his morals and duties.

","Well I must say hats off to the director because this is exactly the same as my unky Nigey (Who has a glass eye - but that's a story for another time!) told me it was when he lived in France back then. He was best chums with his dear friend Enjolras whose pals called him Curls. Marius reminds me of my great grandson Pauly, he's in love. Some would say the picture showe was far too long but when you've lived a good, fair 83 years on the almighty gods fine soil, 2 and half hours seems like a blink of an eye, much like my second marriage to my dearest Eluise who perished amongst the choppy waves of Liverpool. The innkeeper very much reminded me of my father, who also owned a little inny by the waterfronts of Benidorm. Russel Crowe was inspirational, as usual the very image of a perfect unshaven man. Burly and strong. It was a tad too left wing for my ideas, all those rioting students. It reminded me of my time in Berlin during the second world war. My favourite song remains the rousing ""Do You Hear The People Sing"" because it made me feel like a young whipper snapper again, gallivanting around somewhere. Anne Hathaway disappointed me in her portrayal of a common Harpy. Her pitchy singing greatly lessened my enjoyment of this picture showe. Although over all a fantaberous picture showe with unwaveringly strong performances through out. I give a standing ovation to Hughy, Russy and Eddie. The only thing I hated about this picture showe was that Paul Rudd failed to make a charming appearance at any point. I was waiting all the way through because he was such an obvious choice for a stable hand.<br/><br/>Signing off... Truth Teller."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","6","10","21 February 2013"," Simply splendid
","Despite the somewhat mixed reviews, I really wanted to see Les Miserables. I love the musical, it is not the most accessible of musicals- it is lengthy and feels very like an opera(a genre that I adore but can see why others don't)- but it never fails to give me goosebumps or move me and the music is just incredible. I wouldn't go as far to say that this movie version is completely flawless, there are occasions where the camera angles are a little dizzying and Russell Crowe has an underpowered and nasal timbre that doesn't really appeal to me(it also has a soft-grained rock-opera style that is at odds with the rest of the singing). But I found it a simply splendid film on its own merits as well as a solid adaptation of both the musical and the book.<br/><br/>Apart from some of the camera angles, I thought Les Miserables was stunning to look at. The costumes, locations and sets are both stunning(some of the best of the entire year for me) and evocative(complete with grubby faces and rotting teeth, Fantine's plight is very seedy and nightmarish which makes you relate to her without being forced to). I personally liked the close-ups, whether there were too many is up for debate and I can definitely see why, but they did succeed in giving numbers like Empty Chairs and Empty Tables, On My Own, Stars(visually resplendent in its simplicity), Bring Him Home and especially I Dreamed a Dream a very personal touch.<br/><br/>I can definitely see why people won't like the film. Like the musical and the book it is lengthy and the story is quite heavy-going and quite exhausting from an emotional standpoint. But even with the length- I am probably one of the few who didn't think it was overlong- I was riveted throughout, not only was it so good musically as you'd expect but the storytelling felt coherent and easy to engage with. While there are some amusing moments with the Thenardiers and One Day More was very cleverly staged, there were many moments that really moved me. I Dreamed a Dream is by far the standout rendition of the film and along with On My Own, Eponine's death and Empty Chairs and Empty Tables moved me to tears, but it was the ending that left me an emotional wreck. Valjean and Javert's confrontation has been more convincing on stage, but there were definitely signs of intensity.<br/><br/>The music is incredible, one of those musicals where I don't dislike a single song. The orchestration and how it's played will stir many emotions, and the chorus, their best moment being Do You Hear the People Sing(closely followed by One Day More), also do powerful work. I thought the cast were great. Crowe is the weak link vocally, but I do think his acting is better than it is given credit for. The emotional detachment and grittiness did suit Javert's character and there is signs of authority. Amanda Seyfried is lovely and innocent and her chemistry with Eddie Redmayne is great. And on the most part, apart from some shrillness and quivery vibrato in the upper register, her singing is sweet-toned and delicate. Redmayne is a dashing and very moving Marius, and his singing is full of emotion. You only had to see him in Empty Chairs and Empty Tables to see that he understood and felt every word.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks is perfectly cast also as the well-meaning and vulnerable Eponine, and her beautiful voice and how she presents herself has really come on since the Nancy-finding contest I'd Do Anything(where it was very good even then). Daniel Huttlestone's scene-stealing Gavroche and Isabelle Allen's adorably haunting Young Cosette also impress, and the Revolutionaries are a rousing and determined lot, particularly Enjolras. Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen- she with her facial expressions and he with how he calls Cosette the wrong names- are hilarious as the Thenardiers and don't feel out of place at all.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is outstanding, capturing every side of Valjean's tormented character, whether benevolent with young Cosette, all broken and close to death in the final convent scene, dignified as he saves people from harm(young Cosette especially) or intense in the confrontational parts between him and Javert. Apart from some high-note strain, his singing is fine and he sings every note and word with emotion. To me having a good voice is just one part of singing, you do need to know what you're singing about, otherwise people won't connect with you. And I have never seen Anne Hathaway as good as she is here, you can tell that she threw herself into the role of Fantine and it shows in a truly devastating and unforgettable portrayal. I Dreamed a Dream will not just move you to tears, it will render you speechless also, like Jackman and Redmayne it was clear how deeply felt her singing was.<br/><br/>All in all, a splendid film. It's not for everybody but it's undeniable that a lot of effort was put into this film and you can clearly see this in the acting, the period detail and the emotion behind the singing. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

Anne Hathaway singing I dreamed a dream is spectacular and yes, believe the hype. Her acting is spot on and the emotion pours from her in a good way, even if she is not in the film for that long. Personally I think Russell Crowe is excellent, and I'm not a huge fan, and a great performance from Helen Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen; very funny and huge characters. The scenes in the barricades surge with passion, emotion and authenticity.<br/><br/>Yes I'm a fan of musicals which helps I guess, but this is one to be seen on the big screen and definitely next on stage!

"solidsnakeckw","9","6","10","15 January 2013"," An exceptional movie.
","I'll be honest, I am neither a big fans of musical movie nor a big fans of French literature. Previous to watching this movie, I have no idea what Les Miserables is about, other than it is written by a famous French writer Victor Hugo. After I saw it gets so many award on Golden Globe, bored out of my skull on a Tuesday afternoon, I decided to give Les Miserables a try.<br/><br/>And boy, does the movie blew my mind. It instantly got my attention with the first song, ""Look Down... Look Down"" by Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman)and his fellow prison mate as they pull the damaged ship into the dry dock. Starting from a person who broke his parole in search of a better life, then becoming a mayor and saving Cosette from the Thernardier couple and raising her as his own daughter until the moments of his death, Hugh Jackman is magnificent in this movie and he has brilliantly bring this tale of redemption to life.<br/><br/>Then, there is Javert (Russell Crowe), a person who does everything by the book, everything is principle, principle and more principle. There is literally no gray area, it is either black or white, heaven or hell for him, which only make his suicide scene even sadder in my opinion, because his only wrong was letting Jean Valjean and a wounded Marius go, but he seem to think that he had somehow failed himself and his principal, and decided the only way out was death.<br/><br/>Also worth mentioning here is Anne Hathaway's character, Fantine. Despite her scenes in this movie aren't very long, but her scenes are definitely some of the saddest, especially the scene after she was raped and started singing ""I dreamed a dream"", it is just something very befittingly beautiful when she sang it in a whisper at first, then the whisper turned into a scream and the scream turned into a sobbing voice.<br/><br/>The only downside is that the French revolution's storyline are totally overshadowed by the love story between Cosette, Marius and Eponine. But that is quickly forgiven, when the story shift it's focus back to an old and sick Jean Valjean, where he decided to leave his daughter to Marius without saying goodbye, and ask Marius to keep his secret from Cosette. Also, I decided not to talk about the second last scene in the movie, which the best part of the movie, so you can experience it yourself in cinema. Remember to bring tissues, lots of it.<br/><br/>Finally, I just want to make it clear that every song in this movie is recorded live on the set as the actors and actresses sing it, not ADR or lip-syncing. I think this alone is a very impressive feat and for one movie to success in so many aspect, this is definitely one of the best movie of 2013. For the final score, I'll give it a 9 out of 10. Definitely a must watch."
"mscadden","9","6","10","14 January 2013"," Lacking some vocal power, but fantastic film nonetheless
","As a man, I most certainly did NOT cry through the whole of Les Miserables because that would be weak and unmanly. Ahem. This is a film deserving every nomination and win it is receiving. It is a near perfect blend of the musical, and the book. I think its a blazing example of how to turn a musical into an emotionally charged film that delivers sterling performances from all the actors involved, without being limited by the strict confines of music. It goes beyond any musical I have seen as a movie, virtually creating a genre in itself. Hugh Jackman's voice strongly contrasts against the traditional Colm Wilkinson - but his acting is fantastic, and I got used to his voice. I thought that Russel Crowe did a far better job than critics have been attempting to persuade me. Naturally Anne Hathaway's performance is heart-rending, and equalled by Samantha Barks.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this - if you are a fan of the book or musical you will enjoy everything that film brings to an adaptation, and if you have never heard of either - then this an easily accessible way of seeing one of the greatest tales in literature, and in music."
"dallasryan","9","6","10","14 January 2013"," A Movie For Some To Appreciate
","This is a beautiful and extravagant film of many colors and amazement. One of the bottom lines about this movie though is that if one really does appreciate musicals, theater and opera's, then you are in for a real treat as you will probably love this movie. If you're not a big fan of the theater or opera's however, this one might be tough for you to sit through as Les Miserables is about 2 hours and 37 minutes long, and accept for the credits and a little bit of dialogue, about 2 hours and 27 minutes of the film is all singing. It pretty much plays out like the stage version of Les Miserables. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway own and embody their characters through the passion of their voices and expression of their faces into their soul. Eddie Redmayne and Russell Crowe are nothing to sneeze at though either, as they both give powerful performances as well. And Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add the right amount of comedy to the film. Les Miserables will be a real treat for lovers of the theater, and perhaps for some others."
"iancampbell72","9","6","10","13 January 2013"," Tom Hooper you wuz robbed
","I have one question about the film. How the hell was Tom Hooper overlooked at the Oscar nominations for best director? I've just seen the film. He had a monumental task on his hands, and he pulled it off with great aplomb. I think it's down to Hollywood politics, they want Spielberg to win for Lincoln and this could have upset the apple cart. Don't get me wrong I like Spielberg, he is one of the great directors of all time, but after seeing what Hooper did with this film, he deserved at least a shot.<br/><br/>There were some great touches, especially with the barricade. Having a couple of coffins at the front was a nice touch of black humour, and when one of the main characters died, can't remember if it was Eponine or Gavroche, part of a banner was above their heads with a single word 'mort' which I believe is the french word for death.<br/><br/>Overall the performances were all high quality and my father who saw it with me was a bit nervous about it being ruined being a fan of it, but he was blown away and he is a hard man to please with modern film.<br/><br/>Go see it, and you'll probably agree about my main point."
"pkemp_appleby","9","6","10","12 January 2013"," Excellent imagining of the world of Victor Hugo.
","I feel I should start by saying that this was never going to please everyone, there is too much detail in Hugo's text for a start. Also, a large number of viewers will, like me, have a well formed idea of the sets and visuals in their imagination.<br/><br/>Does this film match my imagination? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes, thoroughly.<br/><br/>The whole look of the film is perfect, with sets and locations setting a striking atmosphere. There plot moves fast, particularly in the first half hour, with much detail omitted (but a lot more than viewers of the stage show get). It is when we get to Paris that the film really takes to its stride.<br/><br/>The cast is well chosen. I agree that Jackman 'ageing' his voice is a particularly fine touch. Crowe (apparently controversial) is an excellent choice for Javert IMO. His style suits the duty-bound inspector, making the transformation in his guiding principles even more marked and emotional. Indeed, some of the most emotional moments were added for him (particularly the giving of the medal). To avoid a simple list of all the principals, I will say that the rest were excellent, with a special mention for Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks. The Thenardiers provided a fresh take that was thoroughly enjoyable whilst staying true to the story.<br/><br/>This of course brings me on to Hathaway as Fantine... Popular opinion seems to be a love/hate thing, so maybe it is unusual that I am in the middle. She was indeed moving but I do feel that the part was overacted. Before I am berated for forgetting how hard-done-by she is, I say this: in real life she wouldn't be singing. There's a balance between realism and honouring the flow and musical intention of the composers. Personally I think it erred slightly too far towards the former. Having said this, it is by no means a bad portrayal and it seems certain that she will bag an Oscar.<br/><br/>The director has a fascination with close in shots of faces, which is overused throughout the film, becoming frustrating. In particular, this came to a head during 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' when I had had enough and found myself thinking ""You have a beautiful set full of empty chairs and empty tables - the visual imagery is too good to miss!""<br/><br/>In summary the film starts strongly and when we arrive in Paris, becomes a game changer. Problems are merely small distractions and often a matter of personal taste. With this source material, this lavish treatment is well deserved!"

They will criticise some of the vocals but they are real and come from actors singing live and perhaps thats why this grips the emotions. Great acting great songs and wow Anne Hathaway has created one of those movie scenes that joins my top ten. Without a doubt this is one of the best films I have ever seen and not been this blown away since NCFOM (thats there to recover some shred of masculinity seeing as I have been a blubbering wreck on the way back home)"
"cameronmorewood","9","6","10","11 January 2013"," Les Misèrables
","The snobs with award show voting rights all said Russell Crowe wasn't right for the role. I think he did a killer job. He gives a tortured and brilliant performance as Javert, and deserves an Oscar nomination for it. We as viewers feel the demons battling it out in this guy's head. He's bewildered by Jean's (Hugh Jackman) compassion and forgiveness, that he begins to doubt himself. He wants to believe man can't change; that all men play different roles in life, and those are their roles to play until the day they die. So when ex-slave convict and changed man, Jean Valjean approaches Javert, who commanded him during his slave days and vowed to find him when he escaped, with compassion and understanding. Jean has a greater perspective on life, and Javert is perplexed by what he sees in him. In his mind, Javert remembers a convict, a greasy good-for-nothing criminal slave, but through his eyes he sees a great man, a man who is leader-like and strong willed, yet a man with love and understanding for the poor. Keep in mind, all these complex emotions are delivered through song. The film literally has very few lines that aren't to a tune, and many of those are battle cries/commands.<br/><br/>Now that I've addressed the offensively underrated Russell Crowe performance, I'd like to move on to the Anne Hathaway performance which everyone recognizes as great. That's because it is. Though her character is only present for the first 45 minutes, Hathaway's heartwrenching, tearjerking performance leaves an impact that lasts for the film's massive two hour and forty minute duration, and then about another couple days after that. She plays Fantine, a factory worker trying to accumulate enough money to both feed herself and send some to her daughter, who is being raised by a hilariously dastardly couple played by Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) and Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club). When she loses her job at the factory, her life is reduced to ruins. She starts by selling her hair for ten franks, and then surrenders herself to a life as a prostitute. When Jean finds her, and realizes he's responsible for firing her and forcing her into the life she's living, he is struck with guilt and sorrow, and vows to take care of her daughter, Cosette. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is also delivers a wonderful performance as Jean, who ages through a twenty year period with some very good makeup work. It is so intriguing, yet so heartwarming to see how Jean, though through parts of his life is very rich, and parts of his life he is dirt-poor, always stays the same in terms of character. When he is greeted by fortune, he doesn't become a nasty, greedy man. He in fact attempts to use his wealth to help others, especially Fantine, after he witnesses what he's accidentally done to her. <br/><br/>But what are we left with other than the spectacular acting? Only careful direction, masterful production design, and the overwhelming grandeur of the passionate and striking music. It's a lot to claim for a musical that's already been made into a movie two or three times before, but despite a few scenes that felt stretched and unnecessary, and there were literally only two or three, I was completely captivated and marvelously astounded by Tom Hooper's Les Misèrables."

","I'm a big fan of the stage production, and at the same time as being ridiculously excited for the film, I also was worried to be disappointed as the casted seemed all for the fame. However, I was totally blown away, I'd even go to say better than the stage production.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway was brilliant as both an actor and a singer. I found it amazing how she didn't try and stay pretty! I thought her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was heart wrenching.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks! Wow! Ever since she has been on that Nancy program I knew she was epic! Blew me away and totally broke my heart.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne was particularly good, I loved how mellow his voice was, thought he portrayed Marius well and managed to make him seem braver than the stage show Marius Hugh Jackman was ideally suited to this part and played it magnificently showing a large vocal range. Normally, the Jean Val Jean parts of the play bore me, but I was speechless towards his performance.<br/><br/>I expected Crowe to disappoint with his twist on what Javert usually sounds like, but I especially liked this performance and his voice moved me.<br/><br/>The Thenardiers were amazing!

"hughman55","9","6","10","1 January 2013"," The good, the bad, and the ugly...
","This is possibly the most flawed great film ever. Fortunately, Victor Hugo's classic novel has survived re-tellings through opera, film, and Broadway musicals since 1862. It survives this film version of the stage musical too. Tom Hooper is to be credited for it's success (the good), it's numerous miscalculations (the bad), and some outrageous blunders (the ugly). <br/><br/>The Good (Things that worked): 1)Two words, Eddie Redmayne! Tom Hooper wanted this musical delivered by actors who could sing. Redmayne delivers the biggest punch of the film. He is giddy and fumbling when meeting Cossette for the first time in a manner that is endearing and believable. Singing ""Empty Chairs, Empty Tables"" he is tortured and grief stricken. His performance in this film is as complex as you might expect from the same actor who played the matricidal Bakelite heir in ""Savage Grace"" opposite Julianne Moore. 2) Ann Hathaway's performance. Oscar worthy, maybe. 3) Tom Hoopers choice to have actors do the singing instead of the other way around. Though it didn't always turn out well, overall, it was a brilliant decision. 4) The indestructible classic novel by Victor Hugo, ""Les Miserable"".<br/><br/>The Bad (Things that didn't work, but could have): 1) Hooper let the singers pace the movie. Bad call. Guess what happens when you tell an actor/singer that they have all the time they'd like. They take it!!! Each singer, with the exceptions of Redmayne and Seyfried, overstretched their phrases, repeatedly, until the pace of the film began to resemble the grinding pace of a rush hour traffic jam. 2) Diction!!! The chorus, which is a whole separate character in Les Mis, was disconnected from the orchestra, and each other, during ""When Tomorrow Comes"". The ""free association"" approach used by the main characters REALLY doesn't work when you have 50 people singing, ""CCaann yyouuu hearrrrr the ppppeoppplle sssinngg..."" It sounded like a barroom full of drunks. 3) The sound engineer should have been fired for burying the orchestral score to the point that you could barely hear them, DURING JAVERT'S SUICIDE!!! Think back to any film with a music score by Bernard Herman or Jerry Goldsmith. You'll hear THAT orchestra. If ever an orchestra needed to be heard it was here. It's a great score. And the music (of this ""musical"") needed to soar above the film. Instead, it sounded like it was being smothered with a pillow. 4) Hugh Jackman, whom I really like, did not have the voice for this role. It's very nasal and strained. I get that Hooper made a calculated decision to cast: Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ann Hathaway, and Helena Bonham Carter for their box office draw and not their voices. That decision will bring in an audience. Doesn't mean, however, that it works for the film. 5) The film editor: for chopping up ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" for no apparent reason, and for chopping off the end of several scenes that needed to linger a bit. Yeesh! <br/><br/>The Ugly (Things that didn't stand a chance and nearly ruined the film): 1) Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter blew it. Too undisciplined to pull off those roles. Timing was horrible. Cohen flubs ""Colette"" so badly that the audience is laughing over the real punchline where he's corrected and is suppose to quickly sing the end of the note with ""Cosette"". Not to mention his out of control ad libs that just look goofy (imagine that with him) and do nothing to move the story forward. They only (and what else is he good at) bring the attention to himself. 2) Russel Crowe: Yikes! Casting him in the role of Javert was the greatest colossal blunder of the entire film. His inability to sing neutered the polarity of right-versus-wrong which the story hinges on. He was so disoriented he couldn't do the one thing he was there for, to act. <br/><br/>Now - does this add up to a bad film? No. It only adds up to a bad ""Les Miserable"". People in the audience were balling their eyes out. The story is compelling and it does get told here. The average film goer is not going to be bothered in the least by the glaring flaws of this work. Especially because there are enough glorious moments to even things out. Eddie Redmayne, Ann Hathaway, Samantha Barks, all deliver very strong performances. Samantha Seyfried, I think, is under recognized for her work here. Next to Redmayne, she does the best job of acting/singing. She has a sweet voice and it suits the character perfectly. She and Redmayne are terrific together. <br/><br/>I think this is a great, though flawed, film. Imagine the sacrifices Boubil and Schonberg made by reducing Hugo's masterpiece from a 1500 page novel to a three hour stage musical. Were there ""Les Miserable"" (the novel) devotees then, they would have been screaming about the bastardization by ""Les Miserble"" (the musical). Today, however, our point of reference is no longer the novel, but rather the stage musical. Set it aside, as we did the novel when the musical came along, and this film is good. It works. And that's all it has to do, warts and all."

It made me smile upon humanity; smile because we are capable of creating such a story which will have such a resound effect on others. <br/><br/>It has caused me to fall back in love with the art of storytelling.

","Les Miserable<br/><br/>The movie was a remarkable performance for acting and vocal talents shown by all involved in the production of this musical. The sweetly and innocently touching role of young Cosette – played by incredibly talented Isabelle Allen was nice break from the harshness of the world. Cosette's gentle character as a child or later as older deeply in love brought hope to the difficult life during those times. Amanda's Seyfried and Eddie's Redmayne love at the first sight was beautifully shown throughout the movie including their spectacular vocal gifts. Hugh Jackmen captivated the audience and embraced the changing role of Jean Valjean with an artistic and charismatic demeanor. Together with Anne Hathaway and Russell Crowe delivered an exceptional movie for audience young or old. Anne's Hathaway performance was mentioned on Rachel Ray show as of an actress that is very serious about acting but not much about herself – which fits very well for both leading actors - seldom found in this industry. The talent of Andreane Neofitou as costume designer has shown throughout the movie to complete the overall effect. Overall all the big or small roles like the ensemble of the wedding dance were interesting and carefully delivered. Director Tom Hooper took his task seriously and put together movie that people can enjoy seeing more than once."

","This film is an incredible achievement -- powerful and moving, making an old story feel new and relevant, and effectively capturing the spiritual theme of Victor Hugo's novel.<br/><br/>A quick disclaimer: If you don't like musicals, please don't bother seeing Les Miserables, and then go on to write a snarky review criticizing it for being ""unrealistic"" or ""hokey."" We all know that in real-life dramatic situations, people don't just burst out in song. If you don't like musicals, just don't watch them.<br/><br/>Les Miserables IS a musical. This is the best version (on stage or in film) that I have seen. It provides greater depth to the characters than I have seen before, the cinematography is beautiful and impressive, and the acting is wonderful. <br/><br/>Musicals are a difficult medium in which to act a part convincingly -- often the songs seem to intrude upon the story, popping incongruously into a scene. Les Miserables is more an opera than a musical -- there is virtually no dialogue outside the singing. The songs drive the movie, and most impressive to me, all the singing was recorded live on set in real time.<br/><br/>This method allowed the actors to concentrate on their acting, rather than lip-syncing, and the results are incredibly raw and convincing.<br/><br/>Director Tom Hooper's pacing, use of live singing, and choice of scene content maintains the spiritual focus of Hugo's story throughout the film. The impressive set design, location shots, and (mentioned earlier) cinematography all contribute to this effect. The reappearance of the candle sticks throughout the film maintains continuity and reinforces the story's spiritual theme.<br/><br/>Screenwriter William Nicholson created some controversy among theater purists by adding a scene that helps explain much of the story. IMHO the scene (in the factory) explains much and strengthens the story. Purists: this is an adaptation of a musical adaptation of a fictional work. Lighten up!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's command of his facial expressions, movements, and singing conveys an incredible range of emotion. The weight loss and dehydration he undertook to achieve the appearance of a starving convict produced such a gaunt & convincing character that I did not recognize him at first. I will be very surprised and disappointed if he does not receive at least a nomination for an Academy Award for his efforts as Jean Valjean.<br/><br/>Likewise, Anne Hathaway's Fantine, starved and desperate, is heart- breaking as she sells pieces of herself a bit at a time to save her child, until nothing is left but resignation and despair. Hathaway surprised many of us at the Academy Awards a few years ago, demonstrating her ability to sing and dance. It is notable that following their Oscar duet, Jackman lobbied for Hathaway to get this part.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried's singing (as Cosette) blew me away -- again, a surprising vocal talent from an established actor, and even more, Eddie Redmayne. Samantha Barks reprises her stage role as Eponine, singing beautifully and giving a moving performance. Although arguably the weakest singer in the cast, Russell Crowe provided a commanding presence as the darkly brooding Javert.<br/><br/>Sascha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are slick and capable as the oily Thenardiers. During ""Master of the House,"" they play out a meat-grinder scene that one can't help but interpret as a nod to their previous musical collaboration in Sweeney Todd. Like the Jackman- Hathaway connection, this is the kind of little tidbit delights us movie geeks.<br/><br/>The context of Les Miserables is the thin line separating the ""middle class"" from extreme poverty, desperation and starvation (e.g., the plight of the convict or the prostitute). This part of the story is powerfully conveyed in the film, and feels especially poignant and relevant in light of our current economy.<br/><br/>Having seen this season's other ""epic blockbusters"" (The Hobbit and Lincoln), considering acting, music, emotional effect, and content, I was far and away most impressed with Les Miserables."

I disagreed with the goof that Marius didn't know Eponine's father at the wedding because he DID know who she was and earlier in the show, he says, ""find her and don't tell your father."" Russell Crow's voice was amazing!! Not one time did I have to play-back his scenes with the subtitles to know what he was saying. He articulates wonderfully!! Anne made me cry, Hugh made me cry... the emotion was definitely there.<br/><br/>Thank you film makers for the experience of a life-time. I'll watch it again and probably learn the songs. ;)"
"foreverknight47","10","5","8","3 March 2013"," A great film in a Miserables sense...
","I'm glad to say I finally saw the film yesterday and I loved it. A very successful re-imagining for the screen and singing live actually works. Why the surprise? We do it seven to eight times a week in a stage musical and no retakes! I cried three times, just as I did in the theatre, which is an achievement since I know where it's going to happen now. Jackman and Hathaway are amazing and most of the actor/singers are really good.<br/><br/>So, let's address that huge elephant in the room and I don't mean that big plaster one that keeps popping up in Paris. (Good to see him working though, even if he seems to have fallen on hard times since PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. I guess that's show biz!). Nor do I mean Russell Crowe, though I'll get to him in a moment.<br/><br/>I mean that bloody Sacha Baron Cohen. I know he's talented and frequently inspired. My problem with him is he clearly knows it and, whenever he appears as a guest star, he appears to be acting in a totally different film. He ruined HUGO for me with his ""Officer Crabtree"" tribute performance and in this film the self indulgence is off the scale. The 'Allo 'Allo French accent comes out again and, yes, I know he changes it according to whatever Thenadier is trying to achieve but even then there's no consistency. The French accent frequently becomes Jewish which I doubt is deliberate.<br/><br/>That said, let's address the Russell Crowe ""problem"".<br/><br/>I liked his performance. I even liked his singing. No, he's not as good a singer as Jackman or Redmayne or Hathaway but, in context, it works. It works because he is the best man for the part as an actor and he conveys the class origins, the struggle with his programming/training and he makes sense of Javert's final moments in a way I've rarely seen in other Javerts who sing brilliantly. He is totally believable and if he occasionally bends the strict tempo into a more rock/pop style that's OK too. It makes a pleasant change in a piece that's 160 minutes long.<br/><br/>To sum up, I can happily recommend LES MISERABLES even if ""happy"" is probably the wrong word for a film that wrings the withers quite so throughly."

","I'll level with you I'm not a fan of the musical genre, it's just not my genre. There are very few I like because they pertain to my interests, for me my fav is ""Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Blog"". But this is one of those rare exceptions because it really is one that has you going though the motions, it truly is both touching and downright heartbreaking at the same time. It's also one of the few films that I actually cry to which is rare for me.<br/><br/>I really love the production value, the set pieces are great recreating a country in both it's glory and ruin in times long gone. The songs are great and memorable, it's almost hard to pick which are my favorites I'll just pick three of them. Number three, ""I Dream the Dream"" this is a sad but beautiful song because it's about optimism coming to an end. Number two it's ""One More Day"" as we see different characters, what their doing today and what their thinking about tomorrow. But of course my favorite is ""Do You Hear the People Sing"" it is just an epic and uplifting song almost makes you want to sing.<br/><br/>However for me what really powered the film was both the characters and the story. The story I felt was great I like the fact that at times it almost kinda a Christan story. There were some Christ like parallels as well as some themes on existence, finding the right path, doing onto others, belief and hope.<br/><br/>The characters on my list I really like each have a parallel with each other but one thing in common and that is all of them are struggling for existence in a unfair and unfit society.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway was great in her small role as Fantine whom just really has it bad, you really feel for her doing what she can to keep her daughter and even her dreams alive.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman whom is an actor I really like (yeah, I'm a fan of X-Men 1 and 2)I felt was really great as Jean Valjean. He's also a character you really feel pathos for because this guy just had it bad and didn't deserve it. I really love the fact that he not just was able to pick himself up in the world proving he's not a man defined by label. But really how selfless he is, he is never a person thinking about himself, he's always getting out of his way for the sake of the other.<br/><br/>Marius played well by Eddie Redmayne he's a character I like. He's a good guy whom is rebellious and a little naive but in a good way. One thing I really like about his character is just like Jean doesn't let class or labels define him. Though his circumstances are different from the rest because he use to be a person that lived in the upper class. But life there wasn't roses and cream for him, his family was hardly warm or loving, and they cut him off all because he wanted to go his own way in life and the people he befriends are from the lower class most notably Eponine.<br/><br/>Cosette played well by Amanda Seyfried is pretty and kinda cute. She's sweet has a slight naivety to her, she is a character of sympathy just like Jean before she had it good she had it really bad. You of course see her childhood, she's forced to live away from her mom and works for this rotten greedy family that gives her practically nothing not even a doll as you see she had only a mop strain doll so that really sucks. It makes me grateful that she now has grew up well, has a good life and the bad one behind her. I do like her chemistry with Marius both do click well and it feels right both deserve each other despite what I feel about Eponine which I'll get to latter.<br/><br/>Though for me my favorite character is Eponine played flawlessly by Samamtha Barks whom I think is so fraking hot. Eponine was just a character I fell in love with. Just like with Jean and Corsette she grew up on the wrong side of the tracks with the lousy parents the Thenardiers, surprisingly she didn't grow up to be anything like them and it once more demonstrates my point. But she is just beautiful inside and out, she's sweet also but I like that she's a little feisty. I really love the chemistry between both Marius and her, both characters were childhood friends which makes the feel for both more genuine. And is also part of why I felt the most pathos for her because her character sees Marius as more than just a friend, she loves him. Don't get me wrong I do like both Marius and Corcet together but personally I felt Eponine and him would of been a better match. And that's what makes it all the more heartbreaking, you can just see her aching for him, having these feeling for him she want's to bring out but is unable to because she fears hurting him but worst of all he just doesn't feel the same way about her. This is something I can emphasize with because this is something that's happened to me a couple of times in my life, so yeah I understand it too well.

","Based on the Broadway musical hit, with a cast of excellent actors, you get a magnificent version of Victor Hugo's book, which conveys the history, violence, poverty, revolution and rebellion and different human personalities - the maternal love, the conviction of the revolutionary youth, the opportunism of the scoundrels that exploit poverty to abuse of the wretched, the repentant prisoner, the unjust and discriminatory legal system and the hard and difficult time of the French revolution that completely changed the course of contemporary history. A masterpiece of Hugo, complemented by extraordinary music, that resembles more to a Wagner opera (the leitmotifs that identify the characters and events, great costumes, continuous singing, permanent drama) that a film. A grim and harsh atmosphere of the big city, Paris, and French villages where the action happens, with a camera focused particularly on the gestures and expressions of the characters, is human comedy at its best, or rather, the human tragedy ."

","Les Miserables is my favorite musical and I thought the movie was great and the casting was spot on. I must admit that I was very skeptical of the cast when announced but they were superb. Anne Hathaway's performance of Fantine was definitely Oscar worthy and exceeded my expectations or her acting capabilities. I am now a true fan. Hugh Jackman was brilliant in the role of Jean Valjean showing both strength and humility in this role. This movie possessed all the qualities you'd want in a film; great acting, strong storyline, amazing cinematography, evokes a variety of emotions, and more. All I can say is well done to the entire crew for this production. Truly a class act."
"jmoney-2","9","5","8","24 February 2013"," A huge leap forward for movie musicals
","Les Miserables I'll say right up front that I'm not much of a fan of musicals, and, though I've long been familiar with some of its songs and its story of love and redemption amidst a 19th century French uprising, I've never seen the stage production of ""Les Miserables."" So, I wasn't expecting to be real crazy about the movie version. But surprisingly for me, I was entranced.<br/><br/>There are two things I hate about musicals: one is characters that burst into song. The other is characters that spontaneously break into perfectly choreographed dancing. But ""Les Miserables"" is technically a rock opera that is sung throughout. That may seem like a small difference, but for me, it actually makes the work more accessible. The actors can't ever technically burst into song since they're already singing. So, the abrupt changes that normally take me out of the movie never happen. And there's absolutely no dancing.<br/><br/>The other deviation from the norm that helped the movie work for me, is director Tom Hooper's bold decision to have his actors sing live on the set. Often in movies like this, no matter how convincing the sets and costumes are, the illusion is ruined when the character's voices sound like they were recorded in a warm, comfortable studio somewhere else (because they were). That problem doesn't exist here. The cast is not lip-syncing to songs that were previously recorded. Not only does the live element make it all sound more ""real,"" but you also don't get the sense that they're belting it out as if singing to the last row of a theater (as they might have if they pre-recorded the songs). Instead, they're only playing to a camera that's a few feet away. Because the cast sings the scenes live, they set their own tempo, pausing where they need to for dramatic effect. The music was recorded later, so the music follows the actors, not the other way around. The change makes a huge difference and its effect is very powerful. Essentially, what we are treated to is a very loose, intimate live performance captured on film.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway delivers the most powerful of these performances. She plays the tragic prostitute, Fantine. (Her mother performed the part in a national touring version of the stage show, so you could say this a role Hathaway was literally born to play.) Hathaway performs the signature song, ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" in one, single, close-up take – and it is devastating.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is also particularly good. As Jean Valjean, the ex-convict-turned-factory-owner, he carries the movie. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also pop up to provide some much-needed comic relief. (I did find it ironic that all of the Australians and Americans in the cast sing with British accents, while Baron Cohen -- the best-known Brit in the cast -- sings with a French accent.) Not all of the performances are flawless, however, and not all members of the cast have the strongest singing voice (Russell Crowe, I'm talking about you). But this movie is an example of the beauty of imperfection. The flaws enhance the realism. You don't get the sense that Crowe's Javert is an opera singer in a police uniform. You get the sense he's a policeman who's expressing himself with the voice he has.<br/><br/>Though the movie is based on a novel that's more then 150 years old, the story has a timely feel. When we see the depictions of barricades in the streets and a populist uprising, one can't help but think of Occupy Wall Street and current debates about social and economic injustice. Maybe the human race still hasn't come that far since the middle of the 1800s, but ""Les Miserable"" does represent a huge leap forward for movie musicals."
"cailek","9","5","8","22 February 2013"," Les Mis is an incredible story of forgiveness, despair, and love.
","Upon hearing news of Les Mis' arrival to the screen, I had two reactions: enthralling giddiness, and absolute terror. Les Mis is, without a doubt, my all-time favorite musical. Just hearing the first bars of any song dissolves me into tears. I was concerned that they'd completely butcher it, and therefore envelope the musical in notoriety. I followed the upcoming film obsessively, devouring videos, articles, and the trailer. My anticipation threatened to implode. Before seeing the film, I prepared myself with tissues, and the annoying slight suspicion that I might be disappointed. I was not disappointed. The tissues were deemed unusable after the first scene. The acting was phenomenal. Anne Hathaway shocked me into silence for a good hour after viewing the movie. She might be the most incredible Fantine I've ever seen... And I've seen many, many Fantines. Her raw emotion, despair, and grim determination was unparalleled. The other actors were obviously excellent, but I felt Anne deserved her own paragraph. The vocals were not the highlight of the movie. Some actors were fantastic, and some mediocre. Frankly, I was disappointed by Amanda Seyfried's voice, who I admired in Mamma Mia. However, I thought she did a great job in the acting aspect of Cosette. My feelings surrounding Cosette are primarily passive, but Seyfried made the role likable. Additionally, I didn't love the Thenardiers, Javert and Marius. (I revered the 10th Anniversary Cast for those characters.) I fully cherished the live singing. I believed that was a stroke of genius. It fulfilled the musical theatre audience's desire for live theatre. It brought a sense of authenticity to the movie, which I had worried would not be there. Overall, I was extremely pleased, with only minor suggestions."
"buswell-db","9","5","8","16 February 2013"," Truly Amazing
","I for one loved this film. I came with a fresh mind keeping out the stage production (which I have seen in the west end). The reason I did this is because unlike some people I knew it wasn't going to be the same, just seemed obvious to me! This film was well paced and told the whole story in general well, lots of people have complained about russel, and okay he doesn't have the best voice but he has a better voice than Pierce Brosnan in mama mia. And plus he fits the role well, as well as being a big actor to try and get more people to go and see the film. In short it is a good film, 8/10 acting, 8/10 singing, 10/10 for the sets and overall looks. And YES it does give you goose pimples at the end just like the show."
"dave-pinchy","10","5","8","14 February 2013"," Spectacular Riveting Emotional Roller-coaster!!!
","How can I add anything more to the many platitudes already written. I went to see ""Les Miserables"" with a hope that there may be some reasonable content to entertain me. Wow! The film was a non stop battering of my emotions to an extent Id not had since watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" 8 years ago. The cast were nothing short of brilliant. I wont give any of the plot away as cinemas are still being packed 4 weeks after release. I have now seen it 9 times and have not tired of it. I have watched virtually every film that has been released in the last 10 years and without doubt, this is right up there with the very best. Whilst the main stars varied in their singing capabilities, none disappointed, which, bearing in mind all the numbers were sung in one take on set, were of a high standard. Most notable performer was Samantha Barks as Eponine. She has stunning looks as well as an amazing voice. I doubt there's been a dry eye in the house during her last song. Anne Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" almost stopped my breath with its' raw and harrowing delivery. Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman, Amanda Seyfried and Russell Crowe all belted out ballads and duets throughout the film with passion and power. Slightly lighter tones were provided by the characters played by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. The scenes and backdrops were spectacular. The music score was magnificent along with the chorus numbers. Anyone reading this will be thinking, will he watch it again? Yes without doubt. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone."

","It's been too long since I saw a perfect movie and Les Miserables is definitely one of them, I haven't seen the musical and I haven't read the book and therefore, I don't hold this movie to any expectations whatsoever. <br/><br/>Firstly, the cast. Superb. Mind-blowing. I can't express in words my delight at the performances. I'm awe-struck. I'm amazed. The performances were so inspiring so real. They were able to invoke a myriad of emotions in me - pain, heartbreak, sorrow, despair, longing, happiness, hope, fear, disgust, anger. It was a true roller coaster..<br/><br/>Secondly, the singing. I loved it. The performances felt intimate and real. Sure they are not Broadway singers but they don't have to be if they can bare all of the emotions and bring out the highlight theme in a musical performance. Of my favorites were Fantine's (Anne Hathaway), Eponine (Samantha Banks), Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and of course Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman). I was particularly impressed with Samantha Banks and Eddie Redmayne. Amanda Seyfried's voice was also quite surprisingly good.<br/><br/>Overall, it;s a brilliant film; one that entertains, invokes emotions deep inside and provokes thought on the various issues of morality and ethics all through its duration. This is one HELL of a movie NOT to be missed."

","The stage musical has always stunned me which is why there was no doubt that I would NOT be disappointed at all by the film adaptation which I have seen three times. The only film I have seen in a cinema more than once in my life! And just when you think Tom Hooper couldn't do better in his career with The King's Speech, this is another masterpiece in the gallery of his career.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is outstanding as Jean Valjean, as is Anne Hathaway as Fantine and Russell Crowe as Javert (who surprisingly can sing, not in it's original key, but still does not kill the fantastic song ""Stars"").<br/><br/>The plot is not entirely the same as the stage musical and songs are not in their original order, but bloody hell, it still works magnificently! The music is astonishing, had me choked up from the classic overture onwards and the new song ""Suddenly"" came out of nowhere, but it managed to touch me instead of saying ""well that song ruined it all"". It didn't...AT ALL! The supporting characters are splendid and Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are superb as the Thenadiers. Even Colm Wilkinson's cameo as the Bishop is memorable for obvious reasons...being superb as well as being known for the West End and Broadway's original Jean Valjean.<br/><br/>The ending had to be the most perfect ending to any film musical. Seeing the dead characters happily in their new world on a bigger, better barricade! The must-see film of the year and the film to win Best Picture Oscar this year for countless reasons."

","19th century France, after breaking parole Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is continuously hunted by policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) and when he meets Fantine (Anne Hathaway) Valjean agrees to find and care for her daughter.<br/><br/>Based on Victor Hugo's novel, starring an all star A list cast and with promising praise from all over the world, I sat in a packed cinema to watch a film I knew absolutely nothing about, and like so many others, I was blown away.<br/><br/>Opening with a bald Hugh Jackman struggling in his slavery and bursting into song, the scene for the time is set and the music is not dubbed. The live music crashing against the waves under the watchful eye of an obsessive Javert, the film is bound straight into passionate excitement.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful story full of passion. There is slavery, poorness, love struck teenagers, scheming warriors, religious power, law and freedom, Les Miserables is an overwhelming mix of strong beliefs, portrayed with vigour by its collection of splendid actors.<br/><br/>Hathaway is the standout with her rendition of ""I dreamed a dream"". Filmed in one shot this is the moment you will remember when you finish watching. A scene, uncut, sang live with Fantine in a deep emotional conflict in her life, struggling for money and worrying about her daughter this is heart wrenching and perfect acting from the Devil wears Prada star.<br/><br/>My friends who have seen the musical have said as well as Jackman and Crowe were here, there voices pale compared to the actors they have heard in other renditions. Personally I believe their performances and acting said more about their characters than their singing, which made the film fit together nicely.<br/><br/>At two and a half hours long, this is a very long film with scenes that are stretched. However these are often necessary for later scenes so we as the audience can be fully engrossed and appreciative of the environment and character dilemmas.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks as Eponie is the surprise stand out. Her confession of love is fantastic, her solo filmed in pouring rain in an isolated street will knock you off your feet.<br/><br/>Sweeney Todd co stars Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen are injected into the story to provide some wonderful humour, which in such a heavy drama was quite a nice surprise as there was many laughs all around the cinema.<br/><br/>The story, packed with such heavy ideas is very dramatic, conveyed through endless wonderful songs. And as a story this works out very well being powerfully engaging but a very unique piece of artistic cinema as well.<br/><br/>Director Tom Hooper combines wonderful French scenery and poverty into the story with feelings of isolated close ups and sweeping heart stopping battle sequences.<br/><br/>Having gone into the cinema without any idea what all the fuss was about, myself and friends came out singing and praising a wonderful artistic piece of cinema, and hopefully you won't miss out!"
"vladsioana","10","5","8","4 February 2013"," One of the BEST films I have ever seen!
","Okay, so, back in November I saw the first posters for Les Miserables at the movie theater. I didn't know it was going to be an adaptation of the stage musical. But then, I saw the teaser trailer, with Anne Hathaway's I Dreamed A Dream, and the theatrical trailer. Both of them seemed very promising, and I was particularly impressed with Anne Hathaway's performance of the song. This all happened at the end of November, so I had to wait one extra month to see the film. When it finally arrived in theaters, I read a couple of reviews, some of them really praised the acting, the editing, the music, but most of them complained that the movie is too long, and slow-pacing. I was extremely excited to see it, but after reading these reviews, I was reluctant. After finally having seen it myself, all I can say is WOW!!!! This was one of the best films I have ever seen! All the actors, and I do mean all of them sang and acted flawlessly (Russell Crowe, despite what others may say, was quite good). The highlight of the movie for me was Anne Hathaway's I Dreamed A Dream. I had listened to the song on my iPhone (I had bought the soundtrack for Christmas), and I knew the song by heart. But when I saw her on the big screen, in that close-up shot, I was stunned. I sat on the edge of my seat, during the entire song, and I can honestly say, it made me cry. Her performance was so full of passion and beautiful, it left me speechless. If she doesn't win an Oscar for her performance, the world has gone mad! Hugh Jackman was also incredible! I really couldn't imagine him singing, but the final result was nothing short of spectacular. Amanda Seyfried as Cossette was another plus for the film. I remember her from Mamma Mia!, but here she really shined! I did not know anything about Eddie Redmayne, who played Marius. I only recently discovered he stared in My Week with Marilyn. He was not as good as Jackman, but he was okay. I really liked that there was chemistry between his character and Amanda's character. You really can feel there is love at first sight during that shot at the middle of the film. <br/><br/>Now, the musical numbers. I loved all of them, although some of them really seemed to slow the story down. The most outstanding were Look Down, I Dreamed A Dream, Castle on a Cloud, One Day More and Do You Hear the People Sing(I still can't figure out why it hasn't been included on the soundtrack). <br/><br/>This film really made me cry! All the reviews I read specified that the film is extremely emotional, and it will make even the cold hearted ones cry. I, of course, thought they exaggerated, but I ended up crying like a baby. Overall, the whole film was a masterpiece, and I commend all those who worked on it! Now, I cannot wait for the Blu-ray to arrive! I really hope Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman win an Oscar for their performance, because they really deserve it!"
"morrison-dylan-fan","8","5","8","2 February 2013"," Tom Hooper's take on Victor Hugo's Les Miserables.
","Originally having mixed feelings about taking a look at director Tom Hooper's adaptation of Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's musical version of Victor Hugo's (who I stupidly did not connect with also being the novelist of The Hunchback of Notre Dame!) Les Miserables,due to it being a movie that was to have all of its dialogue sung.<br/><br/>About 3 weeks before the release,I found myself getting unexpectedly caught up in the arrival of the movie,thanks to talking to a fellow IMDb'er who was looking forward to seeing the direction that Hooper would take,after his last feature (The Kings Speech) won Best Film at the 2011 Oscars.With having spent a few weeks talking about the movie,I decided to at last,pay a visit to Hooper's all-singing The Miserable Ones<br/><br/>The plot:1815:<br/><br/>Being released on parole after serving 19 years for stealing bread,Jean Valjean is given food and shelter at a church run by the Bishop of Myriel.Gathering some silver utensil's from the church in the hope of using them in replacement for money,Valjean begins to run into the night,until he is stopped in his tracks by the man who made every minute of his prison sentence feel like an eternity:Javert.<br/><br/>Thrilled with seeing the opportunity of sending Valjean right back to jail,Javert prepares to arrest Jean until the sudden appearance of the Bishop,who quickly makes up excuses that allow Valjean just enough time to break his parole and go into hiding.Seeing right through Myriel's excuses,Javert vows to search for Jean until he's captured and put back in chains,whilst Valjean looks at the kindness that the Bishop showed him as something inspirational,which leads Jean to vowing that from now on he will live his life as an honest man.<br/><br/>8 years later:<br/><br/>Becoming the mayor of Montreuil,Pas-de-Calais and also one of the Sub-prefectures most successful factory owners,the memory of his horrible past,is at last starting to fade away into the distance for Valjean.<br/><br/>Working in one of Valjean's main factories,Fantine secretly sends most of her wages to the Thenardiers who are ""taking care"" of Fantine's illegitimate daughter Cosette. Getting caught by her fellow workers sending money to the Thenardiers,the Foreman of the factory sacks Fantine and throws her out onto the streets.<br/><br/>Struggleing to meet the demands for cash from the Thenardiers,Fantine decides to become a prostitute,in the hope that she can raise just enough money for the continuing care of Cosette.Shortly after starting her new line of work,Fantine gets into a fight with an abusive customer,which leads to the worn and beaten down Fantine almost being arrested by Javert,until her former boss Jean Valjean arrives and orders for Fantine to be hospitalised,instead of being sent to jail.<br/><br/>Laying on her death bed,Fantine tells Jean about Cosette,which leads to Valjean promising to look after Cosette for her.Shortly witnesses the tragic sight of Fantine dying,Jean is given news that an innocent person has been arrested for claiming to be Jean Valjean,which leads to Valjean deciding that the only thing he can do to stop an innocent man from suffering the same as he has,is to come face to face with Javert for the first time in 8 years.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Bursting the movie open with a huge crane shot,director Tom Hooper displays a tremendous eye of breaking through the stage limitation by the vast eye view offered by cinema,whilst also keeping some of the best elements available from a stage presentation.<br/><br/>Filling the decaying streets of pre-revaluation Paris with dames who have a hart of gold and thugs,who are all more than happy to stab anyone in the back as soon as they get the first whiff of gold,Hooper and cinematography Danny Cohen (who has worked with Shane Meadows and Chris Morris in the past) uses high tracking shots to show the closed in corners of all of the streets and also shows the vast city of Paris to be lacking any sign of colour,with all of the building being covered in mud and dark greys.<br/><br/>Taking things to a more down to earth approach,Hooper contrasts the wide tracking shots by working closely with the great make up artist to give the movie an unexpected Gothic Horror element,with almost all of the cast being shown to have rotting skin which matches the grubby,decaying landscape that Hooper shows from above.Along with the Gothic Horror feel,Hooper and Cohen take inspiration from the films stage origins by shooting the solo songs featured in the movie in long,extreme close-up intimate one takes,which allow for the cast to ""create"" a performance in the same way that they would on a stage production.<br/><br/>Appearing unrecognisable for the first 30 minutes,Hugh Jackman gives a great performance as Jean Valjean,with Jackson showing Valjean to be someone who is desperate to keep hold of the values introduced to him by the kindness of Bishop of Myriel,despite being worn down to the bone by the 19 agonising years in jail,and also despairing over the decay in which he sees around him. <br/><br/>Matching Jackman's intense performance (and excellent singing),Anne Hathaway gives a heart wrenching performance as Fantine,with Hathaway expertly showing in one take moments of isolation,Fantine to be someone who dreams of a brighter,freer future,but realises that the only thing that surrounds her is darkness,which chokes the life out of her in a way that deeply resonates through the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Whilst Hathaway and Jackman show an elegance in their singing,Russel Crowe doesn't so much as ""sing"" the words in William Nicolson gripping screenplay,as belt them out whilst also keeping some of that infamous Michael Parkinson from Robin Hood. From his first scene,Crowe shows a real spring in his step and clearly shows that he is clearly having fun, which leads to him giving the movie a much needed glimpse of light,that helps this grim take on ""The Miserable Ones"" to be a joyous one to watch."

","I wasn't sure what ""Les Miserables"" was going to be like, but I went to see it at the movie theatre anyway and I am very glad I did. This film version is based upon the Broadway musical and, like the stage musical, is sung-through. It is very well done and I definitely recommend seeing it.<br/><br/>The story is pretty much the same: Jean Valjean (not a very creative name, I know) broke his parole and has been being hunted by Javert, the slightly obsessive–compulsive policeman. Valjean meets dying Fantine, who asks him to look after her daughter Cosette. They follow Valjean as he raises Cosette, Javert as he follows Valjean, and also an uprising against the poor conditions that the French are living under during the time period in which the movie takes place.<br/><br/>The acting in this is amazing! The singing is really great too, with the exception of Hugh Jackman. Jackman is good in his role but I personally do not like how he sings. Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway both do wonderfully in their songs. I fell apart the first of many times during this movie when Hathaway gave her heart-wrenching performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"". This movie has an enormous cast, so I will save time by just saying that the acting of the cast, both lead and supporting, is awesome. You will want tissues handy, because, trust me, you are going to need them.<br/><br/>If I were to describe ""Les Mis"" in just one word, I think I would use ""powerful"". The ending is absolutely beautiful, but then, the whole movie is (except maybe for the parts with Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen). This one is a must-see. I will be very surprised if it is ignored by the Academy, because it has both crowd-pleasing and artistic qualities to it. You should definitely watch it, even if you are not really a musical fan."
"righin_s","9","5","8","1 February 2013"," And I thought I hated musicals.
","HOW I RAN INTO ""LES MIS"". Italy is one of the few western countries where the stage musical ""Les Miserables"" is not performed. As far as I know, nobody ever produced the Italian adaptation at all. I got interested in it when I discovered that Russell Crowe, definitely my favorite actor, was involved in the movie version. This compelled me to do some preliminary research, even though I am not keen on musicals at all. Since I've listened to the stage shows, like the 25th anniversary concert (thank God there is YouTube!), I've been falling in love with the story and the songs. So, I was really eager to watch this movie. I was also curious to see why there were several negative reviews about Crowe's performance and about the director's style. <br/><br/>THE MOVIE. I will not deal with the plot, as it can be found in tons of reviews. I'll just give my two cents on the movie. I can see why many purists think it is worse than the stage show. Yet, I don't agree. The singing is more crude, as it is recorded live while acting in real scenes - often involving physical strain. This is a MOVIE. I don't find the less-than-perfect tunes to be annoying at all. They mix well with the sense of reality the scenes convey. Even though not all the actors are equally good performers, I did not find anyone to be dis-likable. Crowe might not be ranked as the best singer among the cast, but I find him to be *very* far from being the worst. His voice, very enjoyable when he sings his own rock-folk songs, here turns slightly nasal in some parts, as this singing style is surely light-years away from Crowe's usual gigs. But his portrayal of Javert remains totally convincing. Hugh Jackman is brave and AMAZING. Full stop. Deserved kudos will focus on Anne Hathaway, yet I think that Jackman is the real deal in this movie. As a whole, I found the film to be slightly too long, yet I cannot find a single scene that I'd agree to cut. A dilemma, indeed. The shaky use of hand-held cameras and the director's inclination (the pun is intended) to repeatedly tilt them are not totally pleasant, but I did not find them so invasive to distract me from the story. ""Les Miserables"" made me hum, sing, laugh and cry. I was totally absorbed in it. In the audience where I was sitting, men in particular found it quite hard to get through the 2.5+ hours of singing (my husband had directly decided not to join me...). As I said, here ""Les Mis"" is known by a very few people, and this will not help the movie to be appreciated. Moreover, in Italy non-dubbed movies like this are very rare as people have, on average, a poor knowledge of the English language. No matter what, I will annoy friends, colleagues and relatives with my pleads, hoping to convince them to give this movie a try. Unless you are *very* adverse to musicals, I suggest you not to have prejudices and to go and see ""Les Miserables"". Oh, and... Women, bring some tissues."
"bevanmortimer","9","5","8","31 January 2013"," Do you hear the people sing?
","I guess there are two types of people in this world; those who buy in to the world of musicals and embrace them, and those who do not. If like me, you fall in to the first camp, I'm sure you will love this movie. From the opening scenes where the two main protagonists, Jean Valjean (Jackman) and Javert (Crowe), first lock proverbial horns, I was sucked in to the turbulent world of 19th century France. The story, if anyone doesn't know is based on Valjean's struggle to turn his life around whilst on the run from the police – in the guise of Javert. All the while playing surrogate father to Cosette, the child of Fantine. Along the way there are thrills, spills, action and romance. Basically, most of the ingredients in any blockbuster. What sets this film apart from the rest, is the seamless way it sweeps the audience through all of life's emotions.<br/><br/>The cast is exemplary. The singing, a triumph. Crowe has come in for much criticism for his vocals, which I believe to be extremely unfair. Would he be cast to play Javert in The West End or on Broadway? No, off course he wouldn't. But then I can't imagine that any of the main cast, with the exception of Samantha Barks (who plays Éponine) would. We must remember, this is a film musical and not a stage musical. Film and stage are two very different art forms, and require different talents. I cannot think of many (if any) other actors that would bring the required level of acting gravitas to the role of Javert.<br/><br/>The casting of Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter in the comic roles of the Thénardiers is a master-stroke. Both slip into their roles with ease and play them as larger than life characters and bring much needed light relief. Bonham Carter somehow manages not to be completely upstaged by Baron Cohen. Surely not an easy task for anyone.<br/><br/>Les Misérables has received a whole host of Oscar nominations, but how Tom Hooper has not been nominated for the best director gong is beyond me.<br/><br/>This is a great film, it will make you laugh and make you cry, but most of all it will make you wish you could sing!"

","Of films most recently seen leading up to the Oscars, this one leaves me breathless, wound up, crying, laughing and in short totally wrapped up the incredible long length of its run.<br/><br/>I believe this film will go into the history of cinema as a phenomenal talent & range of each actor's artistry in singing, acting, comedic timing to compel laughter, tears, anger -- basically the whole spectrum of human emotion -- and infused into the story by each.<br/><br/>Even for those ""not into musicals"", be assured, you'll walk away from this one mesmerized and touched in every emotional string..over and over again throughout each scene."

What a great movie and such AMAZING acting.<br/><br/>Actors that i didn't really know much about such as Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks and Isabelle Allen really moved me.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by Sacha Baron Cohen. He can do so much more than his silly movies (which i do enjoy).<br/><br/>But the hero of this movie is Hugh Jackman. To me after this movie he became one of the greatest actors.

","Les Misérables being my first Les Miz experience as well as my first ever musical cinema experience turned out to be amazing.<br/><br/>The story is great and in parallel to the 19th century French era which is one of my few areas of interest. The intricacy at which the script revolves around the lead characters and some trivial plot kings is marvelous and unlike Cloud Atlas blunder, everything gels here to bring out a perfect musical.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is great, so is Russell Crowe but I didn't like Hathway much, maybe because of a personal whim since I saw The Princess Diaries.

","This film is stunning! As one who cried through most of the stage show, I wondered if this would have the same effect. It did! Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream' is heartbreaking, she did it beautifully, and Hugh Jackman's voice is fabulous. Amanda Seyfried has the sweetest, purest voice and Eddie Redmayne played a dashing Marius. People had mentioned in reviews that the camera work was a little odd but I thought it conveyed the feeling of being on the stage, where we tend to look directly at the person singing, so I had no problem with it at all. The weakest link, for me, was Mr Crowe whose voice was poor next to the others. Had he not been alongside so many fantastically strong singers it may not have been so noticeable but, sadly, he fell a little flat in comparison. This is my first review as I felt so strongly about it I just HAD to write one! GO AND SEE IT! IT'S AMAZING!"
"katz000","9","5","8","16 January 2013"," Magnificent!
","If you persevere through the opening act, you will be amply rewarded for your patience. True, Crowe's singing does not match those around him but the other performances are good enough that his miscasting does not stay with you for too long.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper's use of close-ups gives you an intimacy that would never have been possible on stage. Anne Hathaway is a revelation. She has performed the definitive ""I dream a dream"" and has set the standard to which all others will now be judged. No matter how many times I listen to her rendition, I always feel a lump in my throat. Despite the short time that she is on, she steals the scenes that she's in and truly deserves an Oscar for best supporting actress role.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is superb and fits the role of Jean Valjean perfectly. In truth, excellent performances abound - Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks - to name but a few.<br/><br/>If there is only one film that you would see this year and even if you don't enjoy musicals, I would say that this is the one that you should see - no question."
"ixtar1","9","5","8","16 January 2013"," A moving film experience.
","Saw Les Miserables last night at a special screening with a Q and A afterward with Tom Hooper, Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried. This was easily the most moving film experience I have had this year. While not perfect, it is a great film. Hooper's concept of having the actor's sing their parts live on works brilliantly, and gives his actors a freedom to emote that stage performers don't often have. Most of the stars use that to the fullest. What results are some of the finest performances of these roles I have seen. There has been criticism of the singing, and it is true that none of the principal actors has a voice to match some of the classic performances of this show (Colm Wilkinson as the Bishop excepted). But there is a difference between singing a musical and performing it on screen, and Hooper has gone with actors who could perform as well as sing. If you are looking for a re-staging of the Broadway show on film, then you are definitely looking in the wrong place. But if you are looking for performances that can move you with raw emotion, then you should see this film, even if you don't like musicals. Anne Hathaway may not have the voice of a Patti Lupone or Randy Graff, but she gives the finest performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" that I have ever heard. Hugh Jackman is as good as Val Jean. Less than perfect are Sasha Baron Cohnen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers. Where they should have been fun, they ended up as creepy. Also, Samantha Barks, who has the best voice of the female cast, just doesn't quite bring the pain as Eponine. Finally, I have never liked the character Cosette until now, a tribute to some slight changes in the show, but mostly to Amanda Seyfried. Overall this is an amazing film."
"sweetboyy_99","10","5","8","16 January 2013"," Amazing piece of art!
","Let me start by saying that this movie is an amazing piece of art. It had me shedding tears, i really cried when the movie had ended. I am a really big fan of musical and dramas, and i was not disappointed AT ALL. This movie is worth the money, it's worth the time. I must say though, that those who do not like musicals or music should stay away from this one, as there's music through the whole damn movie. That's right, there's almost no dialogue. However, it works very well even though there are only a few lines of dialogues in the whole movie. Musical lovers should absolutely watch this, and especially if you liked the original staged Les Miserables musical on theatre. <br/><br/>So, let's get on with my review. I warn you, this has spoilers. Watch the movie first if you don't want spoilers.<br/><br/>Les Miserables is a wonderful story about a man named Jean Valjean, who once stole a piece of bread to save one of his family members because they were starving. For that, he got 5 years in prison. However, Jean Valjean escaped before his prison time was done, so he got another 10 years for that. He gets released and meets a priest at a church, treating Jean like his own brother, giving him shelter for the night and food to eat. Jean steals silver, and the police caught him, takes him back to the priest. But the priest asked them to release him, and told them he gave Jean the silver. But he had one condition, that he may use it only for good and for God.<br/><br/>Years later Jean has broken his parole. He disappeared, he got a nice makeover and changed his name. He is now the mayor of the town and owns a factory. There works a woman called Fantine. She has a child and her husband left them empty handed. Her child now lives with an mean inkeeper.<br/><br/>The colleges fight with Fantine about a secret letter, and the foreman catches them. Therefore Fantine gets left out on the street with no job at all, begging for mercy. What the mayor doesn't know...<br/><br/>She is desperate for money to her child, so she sells her hair, two of her teeth, and lets a man have his way with her. She doesn't get much, though. One of the men in town gets on to her and tries to touch her, resulting in Fantine slapping him blooded. He then makes up a fake story for the police, and of course have evidence on his face. <br/><br/>The Mayor (Jean) the appears and asks what happened. He overheard that she had a sick child and begged the guards to let her go. The mayor then found out what his company did to her, so he swore to help her. He took her to a hospital. But unfortunately, she later dies. On her deathbed, Jean promised Fantine that he would take care of her child.<br/><br/>This is where it gets interesting, Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the inkeepers. It all breaks out in a very funny musical number and he does it all very well (although, he isn't really a singer). Jean finds the child, called Cosette. And gives the inkeepers 1500 franc for giving her to him. The funny thing is Sacha always mispronounce Cosette's name, like Colette or Chasette.<br/><br/>Javert (the towns police) have found out who the mayor really is, Jean Valjean, who break his parole. Which is a very serious crime, so he is now chasing after him. That's why Jean has to hide with the girl. He goes to a church seeking for help. He got a place to live with Cosette.<br/><br/>Years later, when Cosette has grown up, the french revolution is about to start. A young man called Marius, falls in love when he sees Cosette. But he can't really be with her because he has to stick with his group of friends who all is for the French revolution. He sends one last letter, before he may die, to Cosette and Jean sees it. He realises he has to help him, because it's her only and true love.<br/><br/>This is a really beautiful movie and musical, it's all put together well, together with amazing performances from Hugh Jackman, Russel Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried with beautiful voices and amazing emotions that makes you feel the characters emotions and situations. It is all beautifully put together with great cinemotagraphy and amazing songs(49!!!). The movie is 2 and a half hours, and i gotta say i enjoyed every minute of them. I've watched it like 5 times now, and i'm planning to see it many more times. It's just an amazing movie. Cheers to the director and the amazing actors in this movie who played it off really well.<br/><br/>What can i say more? Watch it yourself, judge it yourselves. You won't be disappointed. It's a wonderful but sad story taking place in France when the time where hardest and when the french revolution took place. So, my final score for this movie is 9 out of 10. It's really that great, and i'm wondering why this hasn't got more than just a 7,4 out of 10? I think it deserves an 8! I haven't seen ANY movie on IMDb that has a 10, the highest i've seen being 9,3. <br/><br/>Watch it, enjoy it, feel it. Cry. Laugh. Enjoy the music. You won't be sorry you did!"
"cnycitylady","9","5","8","26 December 2012"," Beautifully formated for the silver screen
","Les Miserables is possibly one of the best musicals ever written and up on the silver screen kids of every age can enjoy it! Of course there are certain critiques; The beginning feels kind of rushed, Valjean's early life kind of just flies by. The characters Fantine and Eponine's stories are a bit rushed as well and they each lose pieces if not entire songs but the point they are supposed to make is still relayed. The music is just as powerful as it was in the play or the concerts, and the acting was phenomenal. Anne Hathaway is a shoo in for victory when the Oscars role around. These new takes on the characters are as refreshing as a cool drink of water on a hot summer's day; They let you see different and new characteristics of their personalities (such as Fantine's hate or Cosette's resentment.) You cry at every turn with this movie, ten minutes in your tears are prickling your eyes and half an hour in you've completely succumb to the suffering and anguish of these wonderful characters. If you are watching this in the comfort of your home you cannot help but start to sing along to all of your favorite tunes. (I know I was having trouble remaining silent in the theater.) The costume designs were gorgeous (even though some might say that some of the female characters were heavily under-dressed for the times) as the red, blue and even grays of the movie catch your eye and you find yourself sitting back trying to take it all in, wanting every little detail to remain safe in your memory. This movie was well put together and very well casted as none of the cast disappoints in their portrayal of these infamously famous characters. Special props go to the newcomers to the silver screen Samantha Barks, Isabelle Allen and Danielle Huttlestone who definitely held their own with the seasoned actors of Hollywood. This movie gets nine stars out of ten because they left out some catchy songs, it could have been twenty minutes longer and because no movie is perfect."
"eashor10","10","5","8","26 December 2012"," Incroyable! C'est magnifique!
","I have never read or seen Les Mis before, but now understand it's endurance on Broadway and as a classic piece of literature. This movie is more of an experience than a ""movie"" and my teen daughter and I left with much to discuss. Anne Hathaway's performance and singing were breathtaking and I still get teary just thinking about it. The entire cast deserve Academy Awards in my book-every character was believable, and created a simply breathtaking performance. It is simply not possible to gush enough. Bring your Kleenex and prepare to be blown away. The only problem both my daughter and I noticed (which was very minor) were the English accents displayed-french revolution should equal french accents, non? M'ais oui!"
"gran_taire","9","5","8","26 December 2012"," Stunning.
","I've been a long time fan of Les Mis, and as an avid film fan, I was obviously quite excited to see how such a long, powerful stage show could be appropriately transferred onto screen. I had been following the production of the film for the whole year, but it wasn't until I was finally sitting in the cinema that I realized this film was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>First off, let me just say that the stage musical is longer (although it does have an intermission) and some argue that it is difficult to understand if you are not familiar with the plot. This film HAD to make some song cuts and some changes to make it shorter and more understandable. Director Tom Hooper had millions of Les Mis fans watching his every move, so naturally he would disappoint some people with practically every decision he made. The acting too, was superb. I cannot think of one actor in the film that wasn't good enough; even down to the last chorus role, everyone was great. The gutsy decision to encourage acting over singing has really paid off. The live singing would have gone to WASTE if they were going for a polished version. You can feel the pain of each of the characters. Standouts include Hathaway, Barks and Redmayne. I was not disappointed with any singing either. Even Crowe, with whom I had my doubts, had a wonderful husky voice to fit a husky character.<br/><br/>The camera angles have turned some off, but personally, I hardly noticed them making a difference. I loved the camera-work in the King's Speech, and it works just as well here. The closeup shots have gained plenty of criticism, and I might say that this too is where I had some issues. I reckon the closeup shots worked wonders for the heart-wrenching solos, but for other times it felt a little awkward. Although I do understand Hooper's reasoning in shoving the poor living conditions in the viewer's face. The cinematography was great at the right moments, but at times I felt that the set could have been more spectacular. So much action happened in one set in the second half of the film, and I feel that if we saw more it would have added a dimension. The sets they did use however were terrific to the last spot.<br/><br/>The new song and leitmotifs added work wanders to give the film an essence of something new for avid fans. I would admit it would have been upsetting if it was just the EXACT same as the stage show, because it has been seen so many times by so many people that they may have felt on familiar ground in the cinema.<br/><br/>In the end, all I can say is that the film is a masterpiece of modern cinema, and will certainly go down as one of the classics of musical film. While it may not come to win too many awards due to strong competition in cinema this year, it must certainly not go down unrecognized; and word-of-mouth, as I have seen in it's two days since the release, will bring it further than awards ever could. Tom Hooper has done a fine, innovative job in adapting this loved musical. Under the wrong vision, Les Mis could have turned out much much much worse."
"jdripper76","10","5","8","25 December 2012"," See the Legend!!
","Like any good fan, I have been waiting with eager anticipation for this movie and Tom Hooper has delivered.<br/><br/>It will be very hard to write a fair review considering I have seen the Broadway musical live as well as the DVD's of the 10th and 25th anniversary of it, but I will try.<br/><br/>The sets/costumes...Very good, had the time period nailed perfect, watching the prisoners try to bring in a ship was kind of awe struck. To be honest the Barricade was a little weak, but they were working within their means of the period. However I was confused, because the ending had the Barricade that was envisioned.<br/><br/>But let's talk about what really matters...the singing.<br/><br/>Val Jean: I really wasn't worried with Hugh Jackman being cast, but I was concerned when I saw ""making of"" clips and he was talking about how he can control the tempo but considering he is an accomplished Broadway actor, he nailed it perfect.<br/><br/>Javert: Russel Crowe also did a good job. He had the physical presence of the role nailed however there were some spots where his voice was off.<br/><br/>Fantine: Ann Hatheway did an excellent job. I really did love her take on ""I dream a dream"". Instead of making it a romantic version that usually portrayed on the stage, she made it more emotional and made you feel the pain Fantine was experiencing.<br/><br/>Thenardiers: Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter both did a good job and actually fit the roles perfect. Watching ""Master of the House"" was a fun scene.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast hit their spots as well.<br/><br/>My one issue that I had, was they wrote a new song just for the movie. They also deleted a song as well. I guess that is the purest talking in me.<br/><br/>I should also mention..It was awesome to see Colm Wilkinson in the movie. He was the original Val Jean from Broadway and it was something special to see him on the screen.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to see this movie again."
"DCHybrid02","6","3","4","26 April 2016"," It was cool.
","Before seeing this movie, I'd heard of Les Miserables, but never knew what it was about. Wow! Very interesting story. It's sad, but with a title like Les Miserables, I don't know how one can expect anything else. <br/><br/>Now, I have to share my opinion regarding the choices for the production of this movie. I could rant on and on about how a city full of French people sound like their English because an English accent is apparently the default accent for anyone who isn't American. Sure, that's annoying, but I had bigger concerns. <br/><br/>I felt that this movie had some serious casting issues. Les Miserables is supposed to be an opera. The people who were cast in this movie are NOT opera singers and didn't show in any way that they were capable of singing in an opera. That isn't to say that the actors and actresses can't sing. I know some of them can, like Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman. But they don't have the voices needed to pull this type of singing off.<br/><br/>After watching this, I decided that I had to see a live production. A few months later, I got my chance. I was blown away by the talent on the stage. But this talent just further emphasized the shortcomings of the actors in the movie. They would have been fine if they were just acting in a regular movie, but they weren't. At times, it was if they were acting while they were singing, such as in ""I Dreamed a Dream."" It isn't exactly pleasing to the ears when I had to hear Hathaway cry while she sang. I couldn't even understand all of the words at first. Points to her for good acting, though.<br/><br/>The only members of the main cast who sounded as if they had the chops to do this the way it's supposed to be done were Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit. I know Barks played Eponine in the 2010 version of Les Miz. She was phenomenal then and phenomenal in this. The guard at the barricades who spoke to the rebels after Gavroche died also sounded as if he was supposed to be in this movie. Excluding Colm Wilkinson as the bishop (he was the original Valjean on Broadway), the other cast members seemed as if they should have been replaced with lesser- known actors who actually have the range to do this kind of singing. <br/><br/>Anyways, I had to get that off my chest. I only gave this movie a 6 because I liked the story, and I've read about how hard the actors worked on it. I'll always appreciate that it opened my eyes to the world of Les Miz, but I've preferred basically every other version of Les Miz's songs over the ones in the movie."
"sttfishman3","10","3","4","14 August 2013"," A wonderful movie musical
","Although I had never seen ""Les ""Mis"" before, I was very eager to see the movie. I do like musicals and it looked like a very good story as well. I absolutely loved the music and how passionate the performances were by the actors. I actually liked the fact that the majority of the film was sung. It brought a certain emotion to it that simply can't be felt by talking. The story was very touching and it was a joy to see the transformation of Jean Valjean. It was amazing to see that he could go from a prisoner with nothing to a man who changes his life and becomes a father to a young girl who is in desperate need. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is definitely worth watching."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","4","4 February 2013"," Less Miserables than the 1996 Les Miserables version, but not as good as the stage.
","Director Tom Hooper is able to turn the film somewhat like stage, by the use of close ups and simple cut takes. Still, I think the stage works better than film. Les Miserables is a musical that is hard to put on film due to a lot of reasons such as group singing where it's hard to make it seems natural or organic. Second off, it's jumps around why too much, scenes and time making it hard to shot. Third is too many characters with sub-plots. Last the film is bit overcoming on its Christian theme that might turn down some viewers. Make no mistake—the film is grimy and ugly in its portrayal of human depravity, but it's out of that ugliness that the filmmakers make God's grace shines even more brightly. It's weird in a way to have Christianity intro-line with revolution thoughts of the time, since most of the 19th century Age of Enlightenment revolutions were so anti-clericalism. The story recounts the parole of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackson) who spent 19 years in hard labor for stealing a piece of bread for his sister's hungry child. The film closely follows the book by Victor Hugo, Valjean is trying to make due to get back into life, but forced by hunger to continue his criminal ways. Hugh Jackson did well to make him look hungry even going so far to lose 15 pounds. His singing voice is great, it's opens up the audience whom forget about his musical background. It all changes when he meets a priest who saves him with a gift of silver to only do good. Grace and forgiveness effect a change of character in Valjean and he becomes a successful, wealthy, and good man, but always in fear of getting capture by Police Chief Javert (Russell Crowe) whom attempts to return him to prison for escaping his parol. Russell Crowe's performance was serious, the facial gestures, formal detective attitude, but lacks in the singing. His singing is rock and roll like, rough in the edges, and so unlike the others cast voices. Russel Crowe was the worst singer in this cast. He might be fine on his own, but he didn't fit the part of Javert well at all and his singing brought down the rest of the cast. 'Stars' the song is a prime example there was zero passion in his version and it made me cringe. What I don't get is how Jean Valjean was able to clench a very livable life with him having to chance his name so much due to Javert chasing him. He escape from the police, a total of 4 times using names like Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre. Wouldn't he one day be running out of money due to that and living in Les Miserables type life like his old self. Well this is where Fantine (Anna Hatchaway) comes in. She in the movie for a short period, but Anna makes good with it. Fantine is a old employee of Jean Valjean whom was fired and force to become a street walker to feed her child Cosette. Her singing of the 'I dream to dream' act with the actions makes the song so real. I was completely convinced of her acting when I heard this song in the movie, it really did look like she was suffering. After hearing of Fantine's demise, he finds the daughter taking her from the crude unmoral corrupt inn-keeper Thenardiers couple (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). If you like the blending of singing 'Master of the House' in a terrible, cod French accent switching to a terrible cod cockney accent, he was great. However, I did enjoy his performance. Helena did her dreadful mockney accent once again, which I've become rather fond of. Too bad, it's too much Mrs. Lovett from Sweeney Todd. Overall, enjoyable, in a thoroughly miserable way. Valjean cares for Cosette, until years later, an young adult Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) falls in love with a young rebel in Marius (Eddie Redmayne). I just don't buy Marius and Cosette falling in love at first sight when they barely knew each other. Honestly in my opinion, Marius is stupid not to fall in love with his friend Eponine (Samanta Barks) Samanta Barks singing is way better than Amanda with 'On My Own', but my only gripe with Barks is that she couldn't hit the lower notes in 'A Little Fall of Rain'. The biggest plus is she's one of the original cast from the stage play. Both Eponine and Marius are tired of being poor, and going to try to hold their own against the French government in the June Rebellion of 1832. Valjean seeing rebellion coming ahead to force to decide if he willing to risk his life to get Marius and Cosette together, or escape with the unhappy Cosette out of the country. My favorite song is 'Look Down' & ""The People's Song"" as both explains well what's the real story of the film. The unjust treatment of the poor. When the young people are joining the revolution, it shows us how young people who had a voice were able to change the way the government works. We see that so much in the Occupy Movement and it's a nice piece of film to show how young minds can have an impact on change. Still it's feels out of place with Valjean's story arch. The movie has too much songs, that some of them are a bit mediocre and it hurts the film. The movie plays less than a musical and more like a tragedy opera. The movie is just too depressing but it does a good job of showing mercy triumphs over judgment. If not, the story would be too depressing to watch. Still it's a semi-downer, but you knew it coming in. After all, it's call Les Miserables for a reason. Not Les pour être heureux."
"sarah_412","6","4","6","7 April 2016"," Big actors, not big voices
","I have been a big fan of Les Miserables since I was very young. I remember watching the 10th Anniversary concert on PBS as a kid and just being blown away by the singing, the music, and the story. I became so transfixed by it that I had my mom buy me the unabridged version of Les Miserables by Victor Hugo and read the whole thing .... twice.<br/><br/>With all that being said, I was really excited to see this movie. The previews made it look great. I had seen the last version of Les Miserables with Liam Neeson and had been thoroughly disappointed afterwards, especially with the ending. I was really hoping that this one would take the ending further, like the concert does. On that aspect - I was not disappointed at all. The production, the visuals, the costumes, it was all very good. I loved the ending, and I loved the cameo by Colm Wilkenson at the beginning (who played Valjean in the musical). What I did not like was the singing. Yes, they inserted some great big actors to get interest ... but they can't sing worth anything. They can sing better than I can, but when you watch the concert and then you watch this, the songs feel somewhat ... emptier. I was highly disappointed that the casting decision had been aimed more at big names than actual musical talent. Songs that are supposed to be overwhelmingly powerful have been reduced so much that almost none of the emotion you want to feel can possibly be expressed, due to the lack of both the vocal range and the vocal power of the actors.<br/><br/>It was a good try .... I suppose for those that never watched the concert it would be very enjoyable. For us life-long fans ... not so much. I am going to stick with the 10th anniversary concert."
"fildowns","8","4","6","24 January 2013"," Stop shaking the camera on purpose!!
","Dear Mr Hooper, <br/><br/>First of all, thank you for a near-perfect film.<br/><br/>However, if you want to be all trendy and not use tripods then that's up to you of course, but having the cinematographer shake the camera about ON PURPOSE is distracting, over-rated and looks amateur. Actually perhaps I'm being too harsh here...on amateurs. No amateur cameraman that I've seen, jostles his instrument about deliberately, to further exaggerate the ""hand-heldness"" of the camera! Why would he? He knows it'll be annoying and possibly nauseating to his viewers. So he tries his best to keep it still...but we can still tell it's hand-held. And we can tell this very easily because we are NOT COMPLETELY STUPID.<br/><br/>You wanted a live feel and so you mic'ed up the actors on set and filmed and used long takes. Brilliant. Awesome. I have never seen or heard better singing performances on the silver screen. Like I said initially, this movie was near-perfection for me.

Commendable. It's okay not to use tripods. But having the camera bouncing around even more, not only draws attention to the cinematographic hardware, but also to the fact it's being deliberately mishandled. That detracts from the subject matter, and we don't need it thanks.

","Please pardon me while I send a couple tweets: <br/><br/>@AmandaSeyfried: Please stop singing. Play to your strengths - you are pretty and you can act. Just please, no more singing! #torture<br/><br/>@Eddie_Redmayne: Please consider following the advice I gave @AmandaSeyfried. #pleasestop<br/><br/>Okay, I'm back.<br/><br/>Honestly, their voices have been rattling my eardrums for weeks. Sweet Amanda (whom I truly hate being negative about-she's just so darn adorable), has this strange high-pitched falsetto-thing going on that is absolutely jarring. And I am completely baffled by Eddie Redmayne being cast as Marius. He is surrounded by several handsome, pleasant-voiced guys who could have easily trumped him in this role. But no, we're stuck with his odd tenor, which dangles on the cusp of a holler.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie... Sigh. Following all the amazing reviews, the Oscar nods, and an entire history of award-winning stage productions, I was so excited to see this movie. But I ended up so disappointed by, quite literally, every single aspect.<br/><br/>First, the storyline is terrible; it made absolutely no sense. Based on this, I doubt I would even like the stage production. Why on earth was Jean Valjean thrown in jail for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread? More importantly, why on earth did Javert leap to his death after realizing Valjean was probably not such a bad guy, after all? Seriously, that realization was worth an impulsive, gruesome, painful, neck-snapping death? If I realized someone turned out to be a good guy, after all, I would probably be relieved and buy him a ""Sorry for making your life a living hell, you can come out of hiding now"" Beer. Right? <br/><br/>Also, yes, Anne Hathaway, completely committed to her character and to that one amazing song. Lovely! But they completely flew through her story. Since I hadn't seen the musical before, I had no idea that she died, and so close to the beginning! Devastating. Mainly because her story was the only interesting story of the lot. And then she died and I was stuck watching the mess that remained. Argh.<br/><br/>And seriously, the story sank from there.<br/><br/>I kept hearing that, in the stage productions anyway, Eponine's song was the official show-stopper, the song that left everyone breathless. But here, it felt flat and boring. It wasn't the actress's fault, her voice was lovely. It was the song's fault, or maybe lack of character development, I'm not sure. I only know that it wasn't very impressive.<br/><br/>And finally, I like a little redemption, or a little something rewarding with my nosedive into death and destruction. But there was none of that. Just the entire cast (everyone dies, except two), meeting on a garbage heap to sing the closing number.<br/><br/>Bad story. Bad writing. Bad singing. Bad movie.<br/><br/>This movie is meant for the Les Miserables fanatics who are committed to loving everything about this story, and who will never EVER find any fault. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. :-)"
"yoda-88","2","11","23","28 December 2012"," A mess
","A strong contender for worst of the year, and Crowe must be seriously considered for a Razzie.<br/><br/>First and foremost - Crowe almost single-handedly sinks this film. Almost. His performance is dreadful. He isn't acting. He stands, he tries to sing, but looks so uncomfortable its like nobody warned him it was a musical. His final act is hopelessly unconvincing and confusing - there's no descent, no change, nothing happening behind those eyes. Crowe relegates his own character to weak supporting, rather than being a powerful co-lead. There is no drive, no cat and mouse, no fire between the leads. There are major problems with this film, but there would at least have been a through-line if Crowe wasn't so awful. <br/><br/>Jackman is better, but still weak. Vocally he is more competent, but his voice is unpleasant and has no body - he's out of his depth and range. His performance is very one-note and plays as an earnest and frantic Oscar grab rather than anything artistically noteworthy. Its a hammy, unconvincing performance, and 3 hours of his nasal warble is just too much.<br/><br/>The insipid leads exacerbate the problems of the source material, mainly in that the second act has almost no through line. This would be forgivable if the central conflict was convincing or well played, but Crowe and Jackman's lack of chemistry renders the main plot flaccid and hollow. The additional characters are underdeveloped and uninteresting. Most noticeably, Cosette is out of the picture for far too long - bizarrely, the filmmakers opted to add a dull and redundant song to the first act: time that would have been better spent developing the adult relationship between Valjean and Cosette. Most of our protagonist's motivations centre around her, but it's hard to really see where they're coming from. Eponine is rendered redundant, and her solo has no impact - a shame, because Barks is surprisingly effective with what little she is given. <br/><br/>The mediocre lead performances cripple the film, but Tom Hooper's ineptitude is ultimately the real culprit for the picture's incoherence. This is an ugly film - hideously shot, hideously lit, hideously graded, cheap looking sets, and third-rate CGI. The hand held camera is insufferable, as is Hooper's penchant for ostentatiously weird framing. <br/><br/>There is no scope to this film. Beyond the opening shot (some of the worst CGI I've seen in a while), we barely see the city. We barely see the sky. We barely see anything but the bulbous noses of the cast. Hooper mistakes claustrophobia for intimacy - and rather than taking advantage of the storytelling capabilities of cinema as a medium, one gets the impression of sitting in a broom cupboard with the over-enthusiastic cast of a community theatre production. This feels like a TV drama, not a multi-million dollar epic. <br/><br/>Although all the performances are uneven, Hooper most heinously misjudges the Thenardiers, and overlooks their inherent darkness. He plays them as obnoxiously kooky, and they are desperately unfunny. The rest of the film is unapologetic grief porn - the zany antics of these two feel hideously out of place and horribly staged. <br/><br/>The live singing works once and only once - during Hathaway's extraordinary solo. The other actors don't take advantage of the medium, and Crowe and Jackman could have been relieved the visible strain in their performances had they just been allowed to pre-record their tracks. The advantages of live singing are lost if your cast are vocally all over the place. <br/><br/>There's a good film in Les Miserables the musical - the material needs some reworking to make it screen ready, but it's doable. But you wouldn't know it from this uniquely and bizarrely inept film. Apart from a minority of sequences that almost work, this film fails on every level.<br/><br/>What a waste."

","This movie is simply breathtaking in its dramatic presentation of this literary masterpiece. All the actors did a fantastic job drawing us in and causing us to feel the emotions and become a part of the action. The fact that it is a musical will be a turn-off for many, but this is a musical like no other where the songs here are rich and deep, the plot well-crafted, the characters fully engaged, and the costumes and scenery simply breathtaking. This is a movie for both men and women, boys and girls. It is fun, sad, thrilling, and contemplative all in one. I went with low expectations and was blown away by the movie. It exceeded my every expectation and is now my favourite movie of all time. It is nice to see that Hollywood can produce something that doesn't depend on vulgarity and crude humour to attract their audience, and can deal with the theme of redemption from a perspective that doesn't have to offend Christians. Loved it!"
"evanston_dad","5","7","13","11 January 2013"," Yes, These French People Sure Are Miserable
","Director Tom Hooper clearly wants us to wallow in the realism of revolution-era France. I can think of no other reason for his making his makeup artists work overtime to make Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and an assortment of extras look as awful as possible and then stick the camera up their noses so that we can appreciate every open sore and rotten tooth in extreme closeup. There's a scene of Jackman carrying Eddie Redmayne through the Paris sewers, both covered in excrement until all you see of either of them are eyeballs, like something out of ""Predator"" or ""Rambo."" The one moment of comic relief in this angst-filled endurance test is a romp with a couple of grimy innkeepers during which the bodily fluids fly copiously. If Hooper's intention was to convince me that I never would have wanted to be alive in early-19th century France, he convinced me.<br/><br/>The problem is, ""Les Miserables"" the musical isn't remotely realistic. It reduces one of France's many revolutions into a few power ballads and a trite romantic triangle. The characters are paper thin, and are meant to be mere stand-ins for large themes: one character represents ""goodness,"" another ""justice,"" another ""greed,"" etc. On stage, the thinness of the characters and the melodrama of the plot were easy to overlook, because the physical production was so impressive and the music so bombastic. But take the bombast away from ""Les Miserables,"" and all you're left with is a plot that seems downright silly on screen, and a bunch of characters who could be played by anyone. Hooper, in his attempt to make this a more realistic film, takes away the one thing that makes ""Les Miz"" worth watching -- the music. Oh, the songs are all there, but they're hushed and subdued, as if the orchestra were instructed not to drown out the singers (who, as I'm sure we're all sick to death of hearing by this point, sang their songs live on set). This decision, which has been used as a gimmick in marketing the film, was supposedly landed upon in order to give the actors more freedom to act. Which would be fine if there were any need for them to. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway sure got the memo, as both act the heck out of their roles, but there's only so much you can do with cardboard characters and songs that just outright tell you what the characters are thinking anyway.<br/><br/>I don't want realism from ""Les Miserables."" I want to hear ""I Dreamed a Dream"" belted out by someone who knows how to belt out a Broadway show tune (sorry Anne). I want ""Master of the House"" to be the rousing show-stopper it is on stage rather than the dismissed restroom break it is in the movie. It's not a good sign when, at a movie's climax, when you're supposed to be moved to tears, you're instead wishing that the main character would just shut up and die so that you can get up and relieve your numb butt.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Strange how our senses compensate for us. Sight can balance sound in mere seconds. ( A prime example: In the 60's, the winning candidate of the Nixon / Kennedy debates was considered a toss-up depending on your media choice of either radio versus television as your direct means of communication.)  Which brings me to the film adaptation of the musical, Les Misérables, which is a toss-up for me also.  This film adaptation remains very faithful to the theatrical show, but there are some missteps on its journey from stage to screen. Yet the film works very well and is effectively moving, just not as strong as the live stage performance.<br/><br/>Before I go any further, I should state that Les Miz is one of my all-time favorite theatrical experiences.  Both the London and Broadway casts blended their powerful voices and harmonies to full emotional impact. Prior to seeing the film, I listened to the recording of Tom Hooper's film and found the singing to pall by comparison. The voices seemed raw and overworked, never hitting those high notes one expects from its complex score. In fact, the film tends to continually sacrifice the lyrical music score and soaring voices in favor of the melodramatics of the plot. But add the director's striking visuals into the mix which emphasize more of the dramatic elements of the Hugo novel, and the vocal effect are emotionally heightened too.<br/><br/>Hooper's choices in using non-singers in major roles with a mix of professionally trained musical performers from the stage and his approach to encourage live singing to the standard prerecorded variety has mixed results, depending on the individual actor's vocal limitations. ( The ""high notes"": Possible Oscar nominees Hugh Jackman as the heroic Jean Valjean and Anne Hathaway as the ill-fated Fantine, a terrific Eddie Redmayne as the lovelorn Marius. This trio of actors meld their acting and singing seamlessly. Also giving strong support are Samantha Barks as languishing Éponine, and Aaron Tveit as the rebellious Enjoiras. The low achievers: a miscast Russell Crowe as Javert and Amanda Seyfried as a bland Cosette. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, never convey the right comic tone as the Thénardiers and fall somewhere in between. )<br/><br/>And while we are on the subject of highs and lows: It's true that one wants Les Miz to have the epic sweep of Victor Hugo's novel. However, the director literally sweeps the moviegoer into its spectacle with kinetic photography that annoys more that impresses. The film's movement never stops as the frenzied camera-work soars, pivots, and dives like a crazed bird of prey, zooming in on the actors as its hapless victims. ( All of this endless motion was all too reminiscent of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, another stylish musical with French connections. Why, there even is a leftover elephant prop on display! ) With one too many close-ups, I began to worry that this film version of Les Miz could easily become Les Diz.<br/><br/>But fortunately, the strengths outweigh the flaws. The film has top notch production values, letting the gritty realism show the ugliness and inequitable class hierarchy of 19th century Paris. Poverty and hardship are more pronounced in this version, although the film still has its romanticized operatic elements in place and that lovely score by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boubil to envelop any moviegoer.<br/><br/>Les Misérables remains a powerful piece of filmmaking. The devotion and passion to its source and the sensitive handling by all those involved should be commended. The film serves as a living testament to the art of the movie musical, a slowly dying genre that one hopes is finally resurrected by this exciting and riveting film experience. ( May I also caution moviegoers to bring some tissues. )<br/><br/>So with apologies to the talented team of Schönberg and Boubil , I would like to end my film review of Les Miz with some revised lyrics, inspired by their song, I Dreamed a Dream:<br/><br/>There was a time in Hollywood / When stars' voices would soar / And musicals were exciting / There was a time we understood / That films had dance and song / And the songs were inviting / There was a time / Then it all went wrong.<br/><br/>I saw Les Miz and wondered why / Directors try / But fail to redo / Those stage successes often die / From stage to screen, one must still be true / Hooper's film can spin unsteady / His camera moves, it's never still / Some cast members seem unready / For their big close-up, Mr. DeMille! /<br/><br/>But Hugh Jackman acts the part / As Valjean, his strength does tower / Dramatic, moving, from the start / Though his rich baritone needs more power. /<br/><br/>Hathaway's so frail c'est magnifique / She owns the despair, life's rejection / Vocally strong, so tragique / Her Fantine is sheer perfection. /<br/><br/>Barks and Redmayne remain thrilling / Dubbing others could have hid some flaws / Like Seyfried's sharp high-pitched trilling / And Crowe's low and raspy caws. /<br/><br/>The film's production is detailed / Its score's romantic and lyrical / Les Miz does work where others failed / Le grand musical miracle.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"james-t-sheridan","8","7","13","24 December 2012"," Les Miserables: C'est magnifique!
","Wow. Tom Hooper's sensational film version of the beloved musical ""Les Miserables"" comes close to cinematic greatness, offering a thrilling story with few frills. Hooper relies upon his strong cast to shoulder the weight of the story instead of using cinematic pyrotechnics or CGI. He trains his camera confidently on his actors, and it is enough. ""Les Miserables"" is one of the best films of the year and an event of the season.<br/><br/>Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) served nineteen years in a French prison for stealing a loaf of bread and breaks parole leading to his pursuit by the indefatigable Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe). In a new life, Valjean's carelessness leads to the destruction of the young Fantine (Anne Hathaway), a factory worker scrimping to send money to her beloved daughter Cosette. Young Cosette lives with the reprehensible Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) before a decision by Valjean changes her life. Time passes, and the plot centers upon a burgeoning insurrection in Paris involving young Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and the daughter of the Thenardiers, Eponine (Samantha Barks). With love and revolution in the air, Valjean must evade his past and protect Cosette (Amanda Seyfried).<br/><br/>Hooper's direction focuses on the faces of the lead characters, and he delivers long, uninterrupted takes of the singing which I feel is to his credit. He does not chop or edit this film into fragments. Having only seen the musical once (this past fall in Houston), I sat in the back of the theater, enjoying the scale of the cast and songs, but I never got the sense of the faces of the actors that would come from sitting in a front row seat. And, who can afford that? Well, for the price of admission to this film, Hooper puts his stars out in front, scaling down the film from gigantic sets and props. He makes ""Les Miserables"" a film of faces and emotions, rendered beautifully by Jackman, Hathaway, and Barks particularly. With this film and his previous ""The King's Speech,"" Hooper has emerged as an actor's director, putting the best in front of his camera and letting them act. That film earned Colin Firth a Best Actor Oscar and Helena Bonham Carter and Geoffrey Rush supporting acting nominations. His strengths are at play here with actors ready for the challenge.<br/><br/>""Les Miserables"" examines the reclamation of one man's soul, the role of faith in a person's life. A kindness delivered upon Valjean early in the film manifests itself in two major decisions that he makes later. Without being clumsy, ""Les Miserables"" offers up its treatise on the importance of liberty, equality, and brotherhood unabashedly within the framing of faith. I feel that it is Hugh Jackman's best work ever as he proves himself fully capable, both strong and vulnerable, as Valjean. Anne Hathaway's brief work as Fantine is memorable, and her signature song ""I Dreamed a Dream"" stops the film in its tracks with its impressive holding of her face as she delivers a wounded, defiant vocal. Both Jackman and Hathaway are deserving of nominations for acting. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter delight as the Innkeeper and his wife, and ""Master of the House"" delivers comedic gold. Both do really brilliant work here, adding levity and humor to a dark story, as well as a flurry of comic sequences to disrupt the staid pace of the film. I do wish there were an Oscar for Best Comedic Duo; I would hand it to them.<br/><br/>""Les Miserables"" feels a bit long, and I felt at times that I admired it more than loved it. From a technical standpoint, the film feels, looks, and sounds terrific. I found myself less enthusiastic about Russell Crowe's performance as Javert, but nearly everyone else delivers. A film deserving of great praise and no doubt thick crowds this holiday season, ""Les Miserables"" will receive a slate of Oscar nominations and probably a Best Supporting Actress statue for Anne Hathaway who this year handled two iconic roles (Catwoman and Fantine) with dexterity. ""Les Miserables"" is an admirable, technically brilliant film and a fantastic trip to the movies."

","An all star cast, a classic musical, and new innovations make for an astounding rendition of Les Miserables. Unlike most musical films, all the singing was filmed and recorded live, and it made a difference. There was a passion and emotion present that I have felt so deeply and personally only a few times before. Crowe and Jackman were both fantastic throughout the film, and Anne Hathaway performed the most moving version of ""I Dreamed A Dream"" that I have heard. Overall, the acting was well done and I only had a few issues with characters. Sacha Baron Cohen brings a sense of raunchy humor and disrespect to a serious and emotional film. I am disappointed in him being cast, as he ruined some potentially moving scenes. The cinematography was not traditional, and there were moments where it distracted from the story. Many shots and scenes were very well done though, and besides a few shots, the cinematography was intriguing. I don't know how to sum it up, so I'll just say this: if you are a fan of Broadway, or past Les Mis films and soundtracks, this film is for you."

","I am one of the few people I know who has never seen Les Mis on stage, but it ran so long and toured so often and it generated so much enthusiasm, that I assumed it surely must be great and that my life would be incomplete if I were to die without having experienced it. Well, let me tell you, I assumed wrong. Now, any show that is told exclusively in music is artificial and, when examined critically, a bit ludicrous, but if the music and artistry and the story are good, we'll suspend our disbelief. But everything in Les Mis, the movie, is so unrelentingly awful that one cannot suspend disbelief--except for the fact that you've just wasted money to see a misshapen monster moan. The music in Les Mis is downright unpleasant. The sets and the actors do not entertain--instead, they wallow, wail, and waste away. The director must have ordered everyone, ""Let's do misery, people!"" and so they did. I don't know if the words ""dreary"" and ""treacle"" can go together, but that's what you have here: A non-stop IV dripping industrial-strength saccharine that's been (unsuccessfully) disguised as a realistic look at the downtrodden. French politics are never, repeat NEVER! interesting, but the politics of France in the early part of the 19th Century are particularly, appallingly uninteresting. Les Mis, of course, only uses them as an excuse to be miserable and to show hopelessness and dirt--lots and lots of dirt. If you go into the movie not caring about this historical period, you will exit the movie positively loathing the period and livid that you wasted so much of your life having your nose rubbed in it. And if you are not a fan of extreme close-ups, avoid Les Mis at all costs. One agonizing huge face after another, held interminably, assaults you for the fourteen or so hours the movie lasts. I tell you, it's positively unnerving. Russell Crowe should have been allowed to speak his lines. His untrained singing voice and the insipid nature of the lyrics border on laughable. Spending this amount of time with people you don't care about, in a historical setting you don't care about, singing (constantly, incessantly singing!) numbers you don't care about, watching the most unlovely and unimaginative scenery, waiting for death, blessed death to take people away is not my idea of a good time. As a work of art, it's over-done and doesn't know when to bring down the curtain. I just wanted to scream, ""Die, for God's sake, die!"" Oh, and one last point of pique: That singer who played Cosette as a semi-adult is just awful. That voice could make glass shatter if only to make her stop. Don't subject yourself to this movie, unless it's winter and you have no heat in your home or you need more artificial sweeteners in your system."

I should've though gone into this film with low expectations as this would have made me much happier.<br/><br/>I need to pinpoint 1 scene. Master of the House was absolutely dreadful. This has to be one of the highlights of the whole musical for me and Sasha Baren Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter ruined it - they weren't funny at all and could've done much more with the bright characters they had been given. They were obviously used for their name and not their performance skills. <br/><br/>I commend Hugh Jackman as I grew to his character throughout the film but I felt that his voice lacked something. Anne Hathaway was good too, her voice quite magical.<br/><br/>The only worthy performances were from Aaron Tveit and Samantha Barks who shined through their characters - this is understandable as they both have theater backgrounds.

I had seen stage productions of ""Les Mis"" several times and have a copy of the songs from the Broadway production in the eighties. I was really excited to see the movie based on my past experience (liked it very much), and the trailer. What I saw was thoroughly disappointing. They chose actors (some very miscast), rather than singers and it really showed. The ""live"" singing detracted because many times the actors were either so out of breath, or so emotionally wrought that they couldn't sing at all-- talking or shouting their lines instead. The biggest example of this was Russell Crowe as Javert, who neither sings nor acts. Also, the constant use of extreme close ups while they sang became very tiring, and unlike live productions, limits what the actor can do to portray the real drama of the scene. Finally, the frequent and obvious use of CGI was another detractor from what could have been a good film. All in all, I blame the director, and have told everyone I know to save their money and stay away from this disappointing movie."

","I want to start by saying that I love the book and I love the Broadway cast album of Les Miz, so I want into this movie really hoping for the best. I was very disappointed. Mr. Hooper has managed to make a grand, episodic story and semi-operatic pop opera appear to be much smaller than it actually is. He did that by spending so much time filming in extreme close up. And having the performers sing live adds little to the proceedings except in two numbers (I Dreamed A Dream and Empty Chairs At Empty Tables). The movie is also exceptionally miscast. While Hugh Jackman acts Jean Valjean extremely well, his thin, nasal voice lacks the ringing tones to make the character as heroic as he needs to be. Russel Crowe is awful. Not only is Javert badly sung, but he's not particularly well acted. Amanda Seyfried has a whispery little voice that makes Jane Powell and Kathryn Grayson sound like Birgit Nilson. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, both of whom I've loved in other projects, are a mess. The movie is inert musically and dramatically...until we arrive on the barricades more than two thirds of the way into the movie. It then comes alive. The men on the barricade are wonderful. Eddie Redmayne turns in the best performance in the movie and sings a truly heartbreaking Empty Chairs At Empty Tables. He and Anne Hathaway are really the best of the bunch. But most of the big dramatic climaxes to the musical numbers are absent because most of the music seems to be sung in whispers rather than full voice. What is so dramatic on stage becomes rather lackluster on screen. It's unfortunate that after waiting 25 years for a movie version of the musical, this is the best that we get. If you want the story, watch the version with Liam Neeson and Clare Danes."

","This is a movie of a stage musical based on Victor Hugo's immense novel - 'Les Miserables.' The story of the book looks scathingly and at great length at society's injustices to the poor and needy, especially one, Jean Valjean, who is released from prison after 19 years (for stealing a loaf of bread and then trying to escape), breaks parole and betters himself. But on his trail is the wretched Inspector Javert, who believes once bad always bad. The latter half is about Paris, where once again Valjean has fled to live a proper life bringing up the daughter of a woman who fell into the gutter because of his neglect.<br/><br/>A great premise for a story, but how can you engage with a sung through musical on realistic celluloid? Sorry, Mr Hooper, but cast singing live during shooting adds nothing, except for you to boast that you have broken the barriers of film!!!! The voices are OK, but not much more amongst the leads. There is barely a memorable tune or song - just a lot of droning repetition that bores from about ten minutes in! We also have comic relief - Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter - that is just a tired repeat of 'Oliver' and so ridiculous, it spoils what is good in the movie. Which is quite simply a series of overwhelmingly emotional climaxes - how the stage musical was so popular! But even that trick bores after a while.<br/><br/>So direction is piffling, the lyrics and script a trudge through French history without the history, and the suffering over-hyped to be almost laughable towards the end - and doesn't the last hour dragggggggg! There is little explanation of the background to the barricades (the last interminable Act with no interval for a drink!) - and, indeed, the insurrection of 1832 achieved nothing and fades away on screen badly. Remember that Hugo was really writing about the later betrayal of the French Republic in 1851 by Louis Napoleon declaring himself Emperor Napoleon 111 - when he then manned the barricades but the people did not rise to support the Republic! So the story keeps itself alive in the closing stages with the mock-Ruritanian instant love affair between Marius and Cosette (lukewarm at best) and the suicide of the ever dogged Javert, as he realises Man has not Fallen, but can retrieve Himself through forgiveness.<br/><br/>The acting depends on Hugh Jackman, and he makes a good stab at it, but cannot overcome the over the top demands of (cod) opera acting. A pity! The others are alright with Ann Hathaway the pick for pretending to be a prostitute! And the lyrics could have been updated - Herbert Kretzmeyer the lyricist was a writer for the 60s and 70s, and it shows... badly, like most other aspects of this creaking overblown vehicle for directorial and critical egos!"

","Just watched ""Les Misérables"". I am not the type who loves musicals, but this movie just went all the way up to the top of the list of best movies of all times. I cried from beginning to end... No, I did not just get emotional, I cried huge and heavy tears. Not only the movie was beautifully done, but Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway had the performances of a lifetime. They both deserve the Oscars. Hugh Jackman showed how an actor can reach deeply into his soul and bring out feelings that are so intense that they are able to truly touch the souls of those on the other side of the screen. No words I say can do justice to his performance."

","I'm at odds with myself. Did I like this movie because it is a really good movie, or am I so wired into the music that I'm no longer objective. When the 25th anniversary video came out, I couldn't wait to get it. I was not disappointed. I had seen the stage play a couple times and listened to the Original Cast album countless times. The concert was terrific. If I had to, I'd say I would prefer it to this movie. Yet it is apples and oranges. Les Miserables has been done so many times, but in dramatic form. There are relatively new versions as well as the 1940's version. My eighth grade teacher played a piece of one of them called ""The Bishop's Candlesticks"" where Jean Valjean commits his life to paying back the old man. We had read this chapter and it was kind of cool to talk about. This is a very nice version of both play and musical. It is stunningly visual, recreating the world of the rebels, trying to face off against insurmountable odds. The casting here is excellent, though I wonder how these people would handle the theatre stage. Anne Hathaway is probably one of the saddest presences in all of movie history. She sings the saddest of songs and hands the raising of her daughter to a man she barely knows. Russell Crowe is Javert and he sings with emotion and intensity (though much less operatic than the role usually is). Hugh Jackman has the versatility to play the man who must face his god and pay a price to the law. He has a very nice voice though at times it's hard to imagine him aging as he does. I looked forward to this film and I felt good about seeing it. There is spectacle and fear; everything is truly operatic. It worked for me."
"daniel-968-134260","10","6","11","16 January 2013"," A dignified masterwork that offers a refreshing rebirth of musicals on the big screen
","The radical vitality of Les Misèrables is a provocative and commanding visceral experience that offers a refreshing rebirth of musicals on the big screen. Breaking away from the clinical constraints and pure sound of contemporary musicals (and music) that results in a music video rendition of dramatised music and songs, Les Misèrables is a rare and dignified masterwork that strips the genre of its pretension and deception. It gives audiences an experience that is raw and real, where the live singing of the performers is captured in all its vulnerable excellence - what more can one ask for than having Samantha Barks as Éponine singing On My Own in the rain, bringing the lyrics 'in the rain the pavements shine like silver' vividly to life. From its spectacular Wagnerian opening, with Valjean and other convicts hauling a massive ship in for repair, the extreme spectacle of the drama draws the audience into an authentic experience that allows for Hugh Jackman and the cast to bring Alain Boublil and Claude Michel Schönberg's creation to life, and revitalises the poetic lyrics of South African born Herbert Kretzmer, who co wrote the screenplay with William Nicholson, Boublil and Schönberg. Les Misèrables is ultimate storytelling in action and at its most compelling; it transcends the lasting impact of its stage history and signifies a renaissance in cinema that is exciting, invigorating and innovative. The King's Speech director Tom Hooper understands the mechanics of drama and is an actor's director; he thankfully never allows his meticulous direction to impose on the drama or interfere with the sensitive and intimate performances delivered by the ensemble. Hooper gives his audience a close and personal connection between the artist and the artistry of musical drama. Les Misèrables is an emotional journey that fittingly reflects the tragedy that befalls humans, and untainted love that saves us from damnation. Its powerful message 'To love another person is to see the face of God' is an anthem for the human race, fuelled with hope, astute awareness and meaningful intensity that is life changing. There is a serene spiritual meditation in the honesty and anguish of its fragile characters, allowing their helpless vulnerability to surface and resonate with the reality of our own lives; we see ourselves through their journey and in its mirror lay a profound revelation. Although it's a story that's 150-years old - a story of ultimate sacrifice and redemption - it's a story that reverberates with our own lives, illuminating the different and unique faces of society. Les Misèrables is a modern fairytale that not only allows us to experience who we are and reflects the human condition, but allows its powerful cast to reveal their creativity. Hugh Jackman miraculously transcends his superstar persona and crawls into the heart and soul of Valjean; the freedom that Hooper offers his cast allows Jackman to probe every intricate beat of a tormented soul. Russell Crowe is marvelous in his depiction of Javert; his emotionless and statuesque resilience is endearing and when he ultimately reveals his humanity, it is heartbreaking. In her role as the wounded heroine Fantine, Anne Hathaway delivers an astounding performance; there is sincerity in her anguish that is unforgettable. Eddie Redmayne is a revelation in his sensational rendering of Marius (in fact one of the best Marius' ever); the youthful aspirations and romantic soul of his angelic character are excellent. Equally brilliant and memorable are Amanda Syfried as the wholesome Cossette, Samantha Parks as the spirited Éponine, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Thénardiers, Aaron Tveit, who plays the impassioned student revolutionary Enjolras, Daniel Huttlestone as the feisty Gavroche, Isabelle Allen as the young Cossette, and Colm Wilkinson in the pivotal role of the Bishop of Digne. What makes the singing of the cast unique and incomparable is that it is real; there is no dubious dubbing or filtering, but an intense dramatisation of the music. It's senseless to squabble about the tonality or pitching of the voices; these are singers who express the drama through passionate performances, not music rendered through mixing desks. Les Misèrables is a film you can wholeheartedly surrender to. Allow yourself this unique opportunity to escape into the epic grandeur of its splendor; the journey is enriching and revitalizing and guarantees to leave you with the realisation that sometimes it is better to listen, to really listen and allow our lives and the experiences of others to remind us of who we are and what our purpose in life is. It's not just a movie; it's an encounter with a spiritual realm that reflects the astounding and wondrous nature of humanity. It projects the desire and compassion of its heroes and heroines, the pain of our nemesis', and ultimately our unique ability to survive ourselves and those who dare to challenge our individuality. It's definitely not a film you can walk away from and forget without being enthused, but one that connects soulfully with humanity and humanness - the title after all means 'misery' and refers to utmost poverty, destitution and the outcasts, the underdogs, the rejected of society and the rebels against society. It's an experience that allows for countless revisits that grows stronger and more potent with each viewing (or watching the DVD's of the 10th and 25th stage productions, a stage production, or listening to recordings from the original French concept album to recent cast recordings). The hopeful refrain and 'One Day More' will become an everyday realisation that life is what we make of it, and how we overcome our obstacles and live our lives, will impact on our respective destinies. We are all children of Victor Hugo's epos and when we hear the music of Les Misèrables, and in particular the words 'when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drum', the echo of its refrain that celebrates the tragedy that befalls wounded souls, is a song you will want to sing forever."

Each actor personified their role. Every scene was done with attention to detail. As a singer I will say that the Arias, the double arias, duets, and ensemble singing was well blended..I was very impressed and happily surprised with Crowe's performance.<br/><br/>I live in a smallish town by metropolitan standards. The theater was full on New Years Day, about 400 seats in the Big D, and at the end the audience applauded, as if it was a live show...Grown Men were crying..and in the west that is a big deal..this was the most amazing of all the performances I have seen of this play..opera..musical and I feel drawn to see it again before it leaves the big screen."
"gradyharp","10","6","11","31 December 2012"," A deeply moving, masterfully crafted masterpiece
","Les Misérables Is an experience. Director Tom Hooper has realized this timeless and often repeated Victor Hugo novel that was transformed into a near operatic setting by Claude- Michel Schönberg, Alain Boublil and Herbert Kretzmer by opening up the story even more and utilizing genuinely creative musical enhancements. The result is an emotionally charged, breathtaking spectacle that while it is discussing the French Revolution and aftermath as a subject it remains a gently warm tale of love and commitment.<br/><br/>The cast is extraordinary, down to the smallest role in the film. It is truly an Ensemble work and deserves recognition as such, but the individuals should also be honored individually. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is completely immersed in this multifaceted and very difficult role: it is the zenith of his career both as a film and as a stage actor/singer. Equally impressive (and a surprise to those of us who knew nothing of this early career in musical theater) is Russell Crowe's Javert - very deserving of Best Supporting Actor at Oscar time for his powerful embodiment of misguided and tortured head of police, but for some reason he is being overlooked. Anne Hathaway gives us a Fantine that will be the benchmark for all others who sing this role. Amanda Seyfried handles Cosette's difficult soprano lines with relative ease and feels completely right in her approach to the role. Another major shock is Eddie Redmayne as Marius: we all are aware of his acting sills, but this young man has a splendid voice and makes his character one of the standouts of the story. Samantha Barks as Éponine is a star turn, combining screen presence with fine acting and a solid vocal ability.<br/><br/>Each of the lads who spark the revolutionary barricade is outstanding; Aaron Tveit as Enjolras completely wins hearts with his handsome looks, his sensitive acting and his very fine voice and close behind him is performance quality are George Blagden, Killian Donnelly, Fra Fee, Gabriel Vick and for course Daniel Huttlestone as the young spunky Gavroche. Director Hooper has given us a different take on the Thénardiers - no silly slapstick here, but instead a smarmy, oily evil couple whose behavior at other people's expense make us laugh: Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen make them unforgettable. And it is a true bow to theatrical history to cast Colm Wilkinson (who originated the role of Jean Valjean in 1980) as the Bishop.<br/><br/>In all this is a stunning success, visually, vocally, acting, directing, costuming, and large ensemble wise. It is unforgettable. Highly Recommended. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","Les Miserables is a phenomenal film adaptation of the classic musical of the same name. It has tremendous acting and songs that help to set the mood of the film incredibly.<br/><br/>Acting in this film was incredible. I really thought that Russel Crowe was great as Javert and he also was very good at singing which was a pleasant surprise. I thought that Anne Hathaway was very good as Fantine and sang the most famous song ""I dreamed a dream"" very well. Maybe not the best I've heard that song but very good nonetheless. Also Sacha Baron Cohen was excellent as Thenardier, that was a character I remember the most from the play growing up and I thought he hit the character spot on.<br/><br/>For me Hugh Jackman was the best part of the film. He was outstanding as Jon Valjean and made the movie for me. He really worked hard for this role and I thought it showed a lot. I don't wanna give away what part it was, but there was a scene in which he made me cry for the first time ever during a movie. I was very impressed with him and he moved me.<br/><br/>I didn't think all of the cast was strong tho. I have never been a big fan of Helena Bonam Carter and so I didn't find her part that good in this film. Also I thought that Amanda Seyfield was not a strong Cosette as an adult. I did think that young Cosette was very good.<br/><br/>I thought that most of the songs were well done in this film. SOme were stronger than others but the really good ones stood out. The whole movie was basically singing and they did a good job with it, but maybe a few of the weaker songs could have been edited. BUt I enjoyed the music in this film.<br/><br/>I do say that this is not a film for all viewers. I wouldn't take young kids to go and see as there are a lot of dark parts and some violence.<br/><br/>Overall, an amazing film. Acting (especially Hugh Jackman) was incredible and the music was amazing. I think that it should be nominated for best picture."
"RockBiter","9","6","11","27 December 2012"," A Very Satisfying Big-Screen Depiction
","From the moment I first caught the previews of this film and noted the cast members I had a sense that this rendition might be superior. I have seen both the stage production and read the unabridged book and find that I just love the story. I can pronounce myself satisfied with this movie. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and Fantine (Anne Hathaway) show their prowess as their vocal performances alternately soar and tremble and the tight shots add a tremendously powerful dimension to their sorrows. I particularly liked Valjean's Who Am I? and Fantine's I Had A Dream. Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) struggled a little with his vocalizations employing a certain brand of descant which I personally disliked but did not lessen the experience. Also the scene in the tavern with the students, including Marius with Enjolras and Courfeyrac, singing Red and Black, brought tears to my eyes. Actually, that happened on a few occasions. The Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen as M. Thenardier and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiess) were utilized as comedy relief for the most part and most of their very real viciousness was thereby dissipated. That I do regret. Cosette's very real misery at their hands is necessarily 'superficialized' for the film but there were many acknowledgements of the novel:<br/><br/>Cosette's longing for the doll in the shop window and her being sent late to the well in the forest by Mme Thenardier are excellent examples. As is Gavroche's 'elephant home' with the other 'lost boys' of Paris. These may seem very minor but as a lover of the story I was much gladdened by their additions.<br/><br/>Overall a magnificent film and a very satisfying adaptation of the novel."

I didn't even get to finishing watching the entire film as i left with 30 minutes to go as i was cringing with embarrassment for some of the actors awful voices that they must hate when listening back to just like everyone else in the world with a good sense of hearing"
"ttoth01","2","8","16","27 January 2013"," Very disappointed
","Wow. I see a lot of positive reviews. I guess you either hate or love this movie. I hate it.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie trailer is very misleading. I'm not a huge fan of musicals, but the trailer led me to believe that the actors don't sing all the way through. But the people who made the trailer cut ALL the talking out of the movie into the trailer.<br/><br/>Even though I don't like musicals, I can appreciate them. I actually really like the original songs and the story of Les Mis. But not this one. This movie is really awful. I gave it two stars, because I recognise individual actors for singing live, and some of the voices are really good. But as an overall movie experience.... It makes me not ever want to see a musical again.<br/><br/>Not to mention how disgusting some of the scenes are. I know reality can be harsh at times, but, in my view, films like this should not turn your stomach so much. SPOILER: The worst part for me was the part where Jean Valjean pulls Marius out of the battle scene through thick sewage. Was that really necessary to make that such a close-up and extended scene of it.??<br/><br/>In addition, the film didn't really capture the story. The lifelong chase of the ex-convict by Javert isn't clear. The film is confusing in many ways throughout. If you know the story, you might see my point.<br/><br/>If I had watched it at home, I would have turned off the movie within 15 mins, just because I was expecting a 'normal' movie mixed with a lot of music (i.e. where people talk as much as they sing). If that hadn't been a problem, I would have switched it off after half an hour anyway."
"markdroulston","4","8","16","14 January 2013"," Les Misjudgement
","For those of us who are huge fans of film musicals, there is a tragic lack of quality in modern cinema. Sure, occasionally a gem will come along, shaking up the rigid classical structure and offering something exciting, but for every Once there seems to be a handful of Chicagos, Nines and Sweeney Todds. It's tough out there for the song-and-dance enthusiasts.<br/><br/>With Les Misérables (an adaptation of the stage musical, itself an adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel), director Tom Hooper had a better shot at making something great than anyone has for some time. All the pieces were in place: solid source material, a director fresh from awards glory, and a well selected cast of performers. So, after chewing it over for several days, why is it that I'm beginning to think this might be a terrible film?<br/><br/>What works in Les Misérables works very well indeed. First of all, the story itself is top-notch; a bleak melodrama of the French Revolution with an emotional core that still resonates and feels relevant 150 years after its debut.<br/><br/>The cast are for the most part excellent, committing themselves admirably to the challenge of delivering essentially all dialogue through song. Hugh Jackman oozes the nobility required for Jean Valjean, displaying a stunning voice and holding together a performance that could quickly become camp in the wrong hands. Equally good is Eddie Redmayne, playing Marius' strength and bravery with a well-observed hint of naïveté.<br/><br/>The real acting drawcard however is Anne Hathaway's sadly brief role, for which she will surely get much attention at awards time. Her performance of 'I Dreamed a Dream,' one of Les Misérables' most iconic songs, is quite honestly one of the most powerful pieces of acting I can remember, and is so raw and heart-wrenching that you will be left gasping. Not quite as strong is Russell Crowe, deserving of some credit for putting himself out there, but whose voice just isn't strong enough to really convey the menace of the villainous Javert.<br/><br/>Unfortunately almost everything else about the film is really handled quite badly. Much like The King's Speech (Hooper's previous film), Les Misérables is a victim of over-stylisation and awkward cinematography that is at times inexplicably jarring and, for lack of a better word, ugly. With all of the elaborate set design Hooper is apparently so excited about, for the vast majority of the film he insists on using very tight close-ups, making the sets and backgrounds redundant. It doesn't help matters that, on the rare occasions when his camera does retreat enough to show a little more, the over-use of blue screen backdrops gives a ghastly, manufactured look, too flat to be anything close to believable.<br/><br/>Whatever Hooper's reasoning behind the choices he makes with Les Misérables is obviously not for us to know. Adapting a stage musical such as this, I can understand the temptation to capture close-ups, offering an intimacy not possible in a live theatre, and it's precisely for this reason that the inevitable hero moments each principal character has (like Hathaway's aforementioned solo) are far and away the best moments in the film. <br/><br/>But surely a huge reason to do this at all would be to free oneself from the restraints of live theatre and indulge the epic nature of Hugo's original vision? Hooper, far too beholden to the play, instead chooses to merely recreate what could be easily put on stage, not taking advantage of the scope cinema can offer. The result is a well-acted but visually turgid mess, which only seems more misguided the further I get from it.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"
"kentonlady","2","8","16","9 January 2013"," I was miserable sitting through this
","This is obviously a movie you either love or hate. In fairness, I admit to NOT liking the type of musical where all the dialog is sung, but I saw this one because I like Jackman and Crowe. Sadly, they did not make the movie any more endurable. And it wasn't just because of the sung dialog, though I still think it sounds silly on screen.<br/><br/>I only knew the basics of the plot before seeing the movie, so I am not comparing it to the book or play. The movie should be able to stand on its own, and the plot should make sense no matter how little of the original material is used. I thought the director did a poor job of giving the audience a believable story, and most of all, believable motivations for the characters.<br/><br/>Cosette and Marius fall in love after literally ONE glance. They don't even need to talk to each other. Really ? I can see infatuation happening that way, but even Romeo and Juliet had a conversation or two before speaking of boundless love. So, that aspect of the plot was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Poor Russell Crowe, he IS a decent singer, but most of the time he was not allowed to sing in his natural vocal range. What was with the high-pitched sung dialog, especially early in the movie ?! Even Hugh Jackman sounded like he was straining to reach the notes. When the octave was lowered a bit, the male singers sounded a lot better.<br/><br/>The camera work was irritating. Too many closeups ! With Anne Hathaway's big number, I got more interested in whether she would be able to hold back a sniffle or would we see her nose ""crying"" too ? Ugh.<br/><br/>The comic relief was way over the top and mostly not funny. An example: chopping off a cat's tail to add to a stew ? Nope, not amusing, just gross.<br/><br/>Maybe I misunderstood Jean's motivation for seeking out Marius at the barricade, but I thought it was because he didn't want Marius to take Cosette away from him. Then, after hearing Marius sing about how much he loved her, suddenly Jean is acting like Marius is a long-lost son and is begging for him to live. Wow, another amazing emotional shift! I know I am being nit-picky here, too, but I seriously doubt Marius would have survived an open gunshot wound after being dragged through raw sewage. Heck, even Jean should have picked up some nasty infections from that trek. I don't know how they escaped in the play or book, but really, was there NO other route available ?! Russell's character was so one-dimensional that he really had no place to go with portraying him. We get a brief hint as to why he is so obsessed with punishing Jean, but overall he was just a cardboard villain with no real motivation.<br/><br/>Even the last scene (which I presume was set in Heaven?) made no sense. I didn't realize there were political rebellions in Heaven. I sure hope the huge wall of furniture was CGI, otherwise I pity the poor set decorators who had to pile all that up. Must have taken weeks.<br/><br/>Which is how long this movie felt like it lasted, by the way. This is my new ""movie I love to hate."""

","I really enjoyed the stage version of Les Miserables. And I love the CD I made of the most enjoyable 70 minutes of the music. But the film is a real mixed bag. I had forgotten that much of the music is simply terrible -- boring, unmemorable, and ponderous -- and overshadowed by the 70% of the music that is simply outstanding. This is quite a switch from great musicals of the past like ""South Pacific"" and ""My Fair Lady"" that had only a dud or two amongst their brilliant scores.<br/><br/>Some performances, though, were simply outstanding. Ann Hathaway and Samantha Barks, both sang with aplomb and really acted while they sang. They went beyond mere singing to give a clinic in how to perform a song in a musical production.<br/><br/>At the opposite end of the spectrum were the badly miscast Russell Crowe who not only sings poorly, but did not act. He was stiff as a board throughout. Even worse were Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Thénardiers -- badly miscast and poorly sung. I can't understand why the producers didn't cast a pair of Thénardiers from the stage production. Nobody bought a ticket to the movie to see Cohen or Carter. In their hands, ""Master of the House"" lost all of its devilish charm. Their casting leaves me very apprehensive about the all-star casting of Tracy Lett's Steppenwolf Theater blockbuster ""August: Osage County."" My wife and I were privileged to see the original production at Steppenwolf in Chicago and we have great difficulty picturing Julia Roberts and even Meryl Streep (who will probably do quite well) in key roles in that play. When will producers realize that some stage actors really do own their roles and should be cast in the film? Director Tom Hooper really fouled up the entire film by shooting nearly all of it in close up. It didn't work. While his direction was generally fluid and professional, the close-up conceit he maintained throughout just got in the way of the scenes, detracting from them.<br/><br/>Equally troubling are many events in the story line. The way in which Cosette and Marius fall in deep love was simply absurd. And the way in which so many characters turned ill and quickly died was ridiculous. In the years since I saw the superb production of the play in Chicago I had forgotten some of the more absurd turns of events in Les Miserables. To really enjoy this movie, you've got to focus on the 70% of the music that made Les Miserables such a great theater-going experience."

But, with the film version of it finally out (first spoken about by Cameron MacIntosh on the documentary ""Les Miserables: Stage By Stage"" back in the early 1990's) finally out, I am thrilled to say that this movie version of the epic stage musical is even more thrilling on screen than it was for me on stage, at least the second or third time around.<br/><br/>To see all of these characters and their various traumas fleshed out for the computer generated era of big screen effects has made it all the more real for me. Unlike the more light-hearted musical comedies, ""Les Miz"" is a show that cries out to be done on screen in a big way. And from the moment you see the men doomed to basic slavery as prisoners pulling a huge ship out during a hurricane to the exact music that they sang in misery on stage, you know this isn't going to be like your visit to your local legitimate theatre or even to Broadway where it played for almost 20 years. To top this off, the movie version of this Broadway epic has been perfectly cast with its leading man, Hugh Jackman, playing the role of thief Jean Val Jean sentenced for stealing a loaf of bread.<br/><br/>There has been much talk about the way Russell Crowe has played the role of Javert, which on stage, was played as if he was Captain Bligh of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"". Considering that Charles Laughton played both Javert and Captain Bligh in 1935, it isn't surprising that people expect him to be crueler. Less severe looking than previous incarnations, Crowe's performance is actually a bit scarier because he does not incarnate the obvious dominating performance of Laughton or Robert Newton (from the 1952 version) or the actors I saw portray him on stage. His singing isn't as strong as the others (he seems to sing more through his nose than his lungs), but who expects a villain to sing like Mario Lanza or even Nelson Eddy? His singing is adequate, and his performance adds a different dimension, especially his heartfelt reaction to the death of a character as the film winds down.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway steals your heart as Fantine, and with so many people having brought ""I Dreamed a Dream"" into people's hearts, she does an incredible contribution by truly owning it as this character on screen. Amanda Seyfried is a sweet Cosette, while Isabelle Allen as the young Cosette truly looks like the drawing on the show's logo. Qudos too to Samantha Barks for her sympathetic Eponine who plays the character exactly as I remember her from stage. ""Sweeney Todd"" movie vets Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are a perfect couple as the nefariously comic Thenardier's. I always thought that Madame Thenardier was a French version of Mrs. Lovett anyway. Eddie Redmayne adds a nice impish quality to Marius, while Aaron Tveit's Enjrolas is a powerful presence as well.<br/><br/>I was concerned as to how some of the musicals would be done, and I was not disappointed; I always hope that ""One Day More"" would be filmed much like ""Quintet"" (""Tonight"") was for ""West Side Story"", and was thrilled to find out that it was. I had hoped Javert's ""Stars"" would be filmed with his head as the moon in the background as Val Jean and Cosette traveled over the years, but was delighted with how they did it. Javert's final scene is truly haunting, and many of the horrors of these characters truly had my mouth wide open in shock, especially the scene of Val Jean and Marius in the sewers and the final shot of Crowe as Javert. The final is truly touching, a sort of ""Titanic"" ending that really brought tears to my eyes. This is definitely worth a visit to the big screen, and do make sure you have Kleenex."

","I went to watch this film as a lover of the stage show thinking that hopefully it would be a good adaptation with the big Hollywood budget behind it. I was wrong. Some of the casting choices were on name rather than talent which was a shame. A lot of the story line did not follow the theatre version, understandably it didn't need to but for those unfamiliar to the story they would be confused with some of the plot lines. Some songs have been shortened, moved and a couple of new songs added. There were a few bright spots, the great Colm Wilkinson as the priest, the singing of ""do you hear the people sing?"" linking into the uprising and formation of the barricade was very well done and the finale was visually impressive. Hugh Jackman played Valjean well, however he did struggle with ""bring him home"" although that was a small fault and otherwise was vocally and emotionally impressive. Anne Hathaway was a little over the top with emotion as Fantine but otherwise good. My biggest disappointment was Russell Crowe, yes he isn't the best singer but as an actor who has won an academy award his acting was non-existent, he could have been replaced by a dummy and no one would have noticed. There was no real menace and every song he sung was the same monotonous nasal tone, and the big emotional suicide was just sung by him and at the end you were glad he killed himself so he didn't have to be on screen again!! Another issue was why all the convicts and factory workers had northern English accents?? Overall a very disappointing effort with such a large budget. For people who have never seen the musical then the film will impress. For those who love the stage version avoid this film at all costs!!"
"Sam Sloan","3","5","9","18 November 2013"," Where Are Rogers and Hammerstein When You Need Them?
","Don't get me wrong: I do like musicals. But I only like musicals that have real music in them with songs that have something to do them. Musicals I do like for example are The Sound of Music, Oklahoma and West Side Story. They all have something this movie didn't - good songs. In this movie, the music was so terrible it ruined the movie. It would have been a half way decent movie if they eliminated the songs altogether and the actors just delivered their dialog without the singing the dialog to what I can only describe as droning the words. The lesson is this: If you don't have good songs and people like Rogers and Hammerstein with the wonderful ability to write good songs, don't even try to make a musical. I turned it off after a half hour. Victor Hugo's Les Miserables is a wonderful story. Too bad they chose to ruin it."

","As a musical one needs to have musical people. Russell Crowe is pathetic as a singer, he is a would be try hard, have a go sort of mug, and brings down the production to the point of amateur, which is clearly what he is in singing, nothing more,(you tube Norm Lewis). Crowe has nominal screen appeal in this movie, his solo is nothing less than ham. Russell Crowe is a cut below everyone else, and an indication of how much influence his profile had on his getting the role, other than talent. Most guys could pull of a better performance than him, given the backing, and I know a lot of guys that could sing a lot better, he is a joke. Jackman did a great job, his singing was good too, surprisingly, and the female leads are often superb, but Crowe is woeful in his mighty lead, there would have been tens of thousands of male leads that would have shat all over his gig here, sick. Its truly his singing alone that brings the movie down. He took a major lead for a singer when he is not one. He has no voice, Crowe is known for his grumbling speaking voice, its not possible for such a voice to become a baritone overnight, Looserville."

","I'm an old cinema-maniac and IMHO this is one of the three best movies EVER made! Hugo's masterpiece novel (do read it) shines through enlightening and brightly illuminating the human soul! The music and lyrics (from the best musical I've seen) were hauntingly memorable beyond any previous film - (including West Side Story) - and the cinematography is quite without parallel. A total ten - only because there wasn't a higher rating available. Hooper should have gotten best director award but the critics are without much taste at times... Good example back in the 1960's was Phillipe de Broca's ""King of Hearts"" (Alan Bates & Genvieve Bujold) which got next to nothing in terms of awards but ran in some theaters for many many years. Also, Les Miserables (1995-C. Lelouch), with Jean Paul Belmondo... was a true masterpiece but only some precious few critics saw that."

The direction, screenplay, camera-work and music all around are just perfect, incredibly moving and sweepingly masterful.<br/><br/>The distinguished performances in the acting aspect is though possibly one of the biggest factors that makes this such a gem of a movie. From Hugh Jackman's daring, enthralling performance to the heart-breaking, electrifying, dynamic and perfect delivery from Anne Hathaway, especially the ''I Dreamed a Dream'' segment, which will leave you absolutely speechless. These are the two biggest stars when it comes to performances in this film but that's not to say that Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Freddie Redmayne and many others don't offer a skillful and beautiful addition to the bravura cast.<br/><br/>One of the few films that's truly made me break down in tears - more than once - largely due to Hathaway's lovely performance. There is pretty much simply nothing this film doesn't have. There are so many tones/moods it manages to mix superbly - at times it can be sad and tragic, terrifying and intimidating, extremely funny and overall just so astonishingly moving. Just wow!!!!! 10/10!"

All through this movie they all were singing. Even when you think that it would be much better to become silent and listen the music which very effectively describes their characters and the building of mutual relationships. It doesn't matter who sings better, although it is difficult resisting the need to form your own, often laic, judgment of their vocal qualities, even for those actors who that have not previously worked in musicals (Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe). It seems that all of five chapters have a same continuance. That's enough time for meeting with each of characters and for finding that in the most of them Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen add a little bit of humor to this not-so-happy atmosphere.<br/><br/>Whoever you talk about this movie in terms of adaptation, or the division of roles, previously denied them an experience of enjoying in the film with exciting music, epic scenography and memorable costumes, made to make you see this movie once again, so you will be note all this details yourself"

"estebangonzalez10","8","5","9","25 January 2013"," The musical brought to the big screen in a big way!
","¨But remember this, my brother, see in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver to become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, by the Passion and the Blood, God has raised you out of darkness; I have bought your soul for God! ¨<br/><br/>Academy Award winning director, Tom Hooper (The King's Speech), brings one of the most famous musicals based on Victor Hugo's 1862 novel, Les Miserables, to the big screen with quite a remarkable screenplay adaptation, a beautiful production design, and some stunning performances from the cast. The film is directed in such a way that you feel like you are watching a conventional stage musical rather than a movie. For the viewers like myself that live far away from the big cities and have no option of watching a live musical this is as close as it gets for us. Hooper took a huge risk by letting his actors sing live on set while they were performing instead of simply having them doing playback like in most musical adaptations. This is in my opinion what gave the film such a livelier feel to it and made me feel like I was watching a play. The film is almost entirely sung as there is very little dialogue, so if you aren't a big fan of musicals you will want to stay away from this one. My only complaint about Hooper's style of direction is that he used extreme close ups on every character during most of the film, which didn't allow us to enjoy the grandeur of the production design as much as I would have liked. These close ups were a bit too much for my taste. Most of the songs performed were done in long takes so I can imagine how hard and exhausting it must have been for the actors to get each take right. I enjoyed this film very much, but did have some issues with the length of the movie. Even so, this is a great film and Tom Hooper successfully manages to adapt this well known play. It deserves all the recognition it is getting.<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with the novel or the stage play you might want to skip this second paragraph focusing on the plot. The film takes place during the post-French revolution time period where we are introduced to prisoner 24601, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who has spent the past 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread for his dying niece. He is finally being released, but Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) warns him that he must not break parole. ¨Once a thief, always a thief¨ is his motto and he's sure Valjean will end up behind bars again. Jean finds it extremely difficult to find a job after being marked as a criminal and is very bitter about life, but he finds redemption in a Bishop who saves him from returning to prison and makes him turn his life around. Jean breaks parole and begins a new life as a successful businessman who becomes mayor. He is a kind person, but his past continues to haunt him as Javert appears several years later and recognizes him. Jean has to go on the run again, but not before he makes a promise to a former employee of his, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), to care for her child. Jean wasn't aware that she was fired from his business after the employees discovered she had a child and was single. Fantine was forced to turn into a prostitute in order to maintain her child, Cosette, who is being cared for by the Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) who take advantage of her. Feeling guilty for what has happened to Fantine, Jean pledges to care for Cosette and buys her from the Thenardiers. Several years later we see Jean and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) enjoying life together as father and daughter, but once again Jean's past catches up to him as he runs into Javert during the student revolution led by Marius (Eddie Redmayne). When Cosette and Marius fall in love with each other, Jean realizes he won't be able to run all his life.<br/><br/>We are all familiar with the story and the universal themes that this classic novel touches such as love, redemption, mercy, poverty, and the revolutionary spirit. The film captures all these themes perfectly thanks to some wonderful performances from Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway who both received Oscar nominations. My favorite character however was the young Gavroche who was played brilliantly by Daniel Huttlestone. Samantha Barks as the broken hearted Eponine also gave a strong performance. Much of the success of the film is owed to these great and inspiring performances. The songs were also beautifully delivered and I enjoyed most of them. I think my favorite one came from the student revolutionaries, ¨Do You Hear the People Sing? ¨ Les Miserables will please fans, but those who have no taste for musicals or haven't enjoyed the stage productions will hate this film because it is manipulative and over the top. Having that said, I still think Hooper's effort pays off and he's made a great musical, although his best film was the much smaller and far less ambitious in scale, The Damned United, which catapulted him to fame. I did not feel as emotional as other people did about this film, and wasn't moved. In all honesty I was a bit exhausted by the time the credits began rolling, but it still was an entertaining film worth checking out for the performances alone.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"Robert_duder","9","5","9","30 December 2012"," Easily coins words like stunning and breathtaking, this is why movies are made!!
","This is actually the first time for me seeing Les Miserables. I think I read the book eons ago but I love musicals and I had extremely high expectations for this film which were met again and again. It wasn't perfect, I have a few negatives to mention but the absolute raw emotion and power and feeling of destitution made this easily one of the best movies of the year. The scenery was stunning, France was brilliantly and clearly painstakingly created. The gritty dark streets and sewers to the homes of the revolutionaries were all equally excellent. Les Mis as its affectionately known is a film that is 100% song from beginning to end. There are no spoken words of dialogue or at least such a minimum you wouldn't notice. The music is so powerful and moving and poetic that you will just hang on every single word sung, though I think the music is only as good as the person performing it which the lead cast is absolute perfection but more on that in a moment. The film is very long, but that is sort of to be expected given the content and the fact that it is a stage play. The first half of the film is significantly better than the first as is the entire cast better in the first half of the film than the second. I think they made some grievous casting errors in a couple of the roles that really drags down the latter half. But I look at this from a distance as a whole entity and it is brilliantly crafted, it had me in tears and just simply frozen in place for its nearly three hours.<br/><br/>I liked Hugh Jackman before Les Mis, a lot actually, and I've always been impressed with his versatility and talents but I simply didn't understand the scope of his abilities. He is absolutely amazing in his lead role. He commands the screen at each step of the film and his chemistry and his passion just rip your heart out and pour out of the screen. The lack of Oscar nomination would be a travesty. There is only one single performance that matched and maybe even slightly outdid his own in this film and that was the equally stunning Anne Hathaway. If she needed one defining moment to permanently solidify her place as one of the biggest Hollywood stars of all time...this was it. Her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream will rip your guts out and should instantly have won her the best supporting actress Oscar. She was brilliant and every scene she was in just reeked of powerhouse emotion. The film takes an instant dip when she leaves the storyline. Russell Crowe...good ol' Russell Crowe. He is hit and miss for me. I actually really liked his character and performance in the film, the problem is (surprisingly so) his vocals didn't match that of Jackman's even remotely close and that made him seem lesser somehow. Its unfortunate. He still gives a truly outstanding performance and the chemistry between him and Jackman is perfect, if only his vocals were a little more up to par. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter play thieves and villains and the comedic relief of the film. They play their eccentric roles well because let's face it both of them are born to play this type of weird bizarre role. It isn't a huge stretch for either one of them but they do well in it. Isabelle Allen is the newfound star and plays young Cosette. She is just amazing and has a beautiful voice and certainly looks the part. Sadly she isn't the film very long but she makes an instant impression. The aforementioned casting faux pas that I think they made is in the latter half of the film. Amanda Seyfried has had some experience in musicals obviously and she has a nice voice but for me she didn't look the part of Cosette. In fact I found her enormous bulging eyes distracting and looked ridiculous. I just feel like someone with a more powerful voice would have done a much more impactful job. I think they would have done better with an unknown. I hate to say this about any young actor, especially for his first time in musicals but Eddie Redmayne destroys his character and not in a good way. The young man is awful in this movie. His mannerisms while singing are ridiculous and completely distracting. I am no singer but I am positive that you can do vibrato without looking like Ace Ventura. He looks and sounds hokey and it ruins every scene he is in. Samantha Barks is a beautiful girl with a lovely voice and she actually fits her role very well. She is a pleasure to see on screen but her performance is dragged down by the fact that many of her scenes are opposite Redmayne. Honorable mention must be given to Daniel Huttlestone and Aaron Tveit who have small roles but extremely well done and capture your hearts quickly.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper deserves incredible praise for this brilliant piece of work. He got critical acclaim for The King's Speech but this just proves how talented he truly is. Obviously the key plays involved have so much passion and vision for bringing this story to the big screen. This wasn't rushed by any means and their labour of love shows in every single scene. The few lesser performances are completely out-shined by Jackman, Hathaway, Crowe and some supporting members so it matters very little. Fans of the musical will be absolutely floored seeing this on the big screen, no expense was spared. If you're not a fan of musicals this would be the one to win you over because its just so beautiful and heart wrenching to watch. Expect big things from this big screen musical because it is a feat of movie making. Bravo to everyone involved!! 9.5/10"
"RejeanGhanem456","10","5","9","27 December 2012"," Oscar worthy!
","While the film itself deserves an Oscar, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Eddie Raymond should all get one too.<br/><br/>The plot ~ From the beginning all the way to the finale Les Miserables keeps its viewers entertained with sad moments, complex and developed characters, beautiful scenery and scene transitions, amazing visuals, and memorable songs. Keep in mind the actors sang the songs live WHILE filming. Nothing is dubbed or auto tuned. Les Miserables really touches your heart and teaches you two of lifes most valuable lessons: 1. What goes around comes around 2. The most important thing you can give to someone is mercy, love and acceptance. <br/><br/>The Casting ~ No one else could have played Jean Valjean better then Hugh Jackman. He perfected this role and put so much emotion in it that he really, truly deserves an Oscar. The same goes for Anne Hathaway, who although had only 10 minutes on the screen her part is so breathtaking and beautiful to watch. I couldn't feel Russell Crowe as Javert too much. Javert needs a powerful voice. I personally think Gerard Butler would have made a great Javert! Judging by the way he played the Phantom and king Leonidas he would have been an excellent pick. Amanda Seyfried is the perfect Cosette. Her voice is so sweet, and even though a bit thin at times her voice reminded me of Cinderella's a bit. Eddie Raymond is such an underrated actor. When he sang ""Empty chairs and tables"" everyone in the theatre cried. Samantha Barks is THE Eponine. When she sang ""On my own"" I cried. But lets not forget Helena Bonham carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as the hilarious but nasty Thenardiers. The two of them pulled of these roles so perfectly, everyone in the theatre was laughing every time they came on screen. They truly were the ""Masters of the house.""<br/><br/>I will be going back to the theatre again to see Les Miserables."

","Tom Hooper is gonna get quite rewarded for this. Most people feel like directors and film companies keep re-hashing old ideas an stories and that original ideas are gone, but they're just few and far between. What makes this different from probably every musical before it is that Hooper changed the game by recording the acting and singing at the same time instead of recording the singing first. It's this new procedure that lets you feel every emotion the actors have and just takes musicals to a whole new level. The cast is perfect, too. Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Samantha Barks, Amanda Seyfried and the rest all do a wonderful job bringing life to a 150 year old book. (It might help to read a plot synopsis because it's a very intricate movie.) The only downside to me is that movies keep getting longer and nobody's ballsy enough to reintroduce intermissions. C'mon, Hollywood, give our bladders a break."
"tavm","10","8","17","10 January 2013"," I loved Les Miserables. There I said it!
","Though I never saw an actual theatrical production of this musical, I did know about this through some of the songs played on piano by my Filipino ""cousin"" (technically, he was just someone from my parents' native country but me and my aunts in Jacksonville, Fla., considered him as such) as well as watching the PBS concert special with Lea Salonga doing the Eponine part. So it was with that in mind that I was very excited to watch this movie and as a result, I enjoyed it very much! In fact, this being the day of the Oscar nominations, part of me was very glad to see Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, the original song, and this nominated for Best Picture but was a bit disappointed that Tom Hooper was not given the nod as well as I believe his vision indeed put the whole thing together perfectly! And while Jackman and Hathaway performed their roles greatly, one shouldn't discount also Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Eddie Redmayne, or especially Samantha Barks as Eponine. I'm singling Ms. Barks here because of her song ""On My Own"" about her unrequited love for Radmayne which I can relate to all too well. But, really, anything that got a tear from me really deserved one, in fact, by the end, my movie theatre-working friend asked me if I was all right and I assured him I was. I think I've said enough so on that note, Les Miserables is definitely worth seeing!"

","""It is amazing!"" ""Best musical you'll ever see"" they said. Was it even close to the hype? NO.<br/><br/>Les Misérables is probably the worst cinema experience I've ever had. But lets start with what I enjoyed from the musical: The acting was A grade, as expected the actors out stand every time I see a performance from them, notable actors such as Jackman and Crowe, I admit I was skeptical of their singing capabilities but they managed to turn skeptic into believer. At times the musical captivated my attention but then I just went back to eating popcorn and thinking about when I can get out of here. The message behind the acting, the French revolution, courage against all odds very powerful indeed. Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were indeed comic relief which was much needed after an hour of crap. The visuals were exceptional, but as a old saying goes ""You can't polish a turd"" and that is exactly what this is.<br/><br/>Now then, moving onto what I disliked about the musical, I will make this constructive so it doesn't seem like a rant. The plot just doesn't make sense, filled with melodrama, at times I was laughing at the sad parts because they were just so over the top. Let us talk about Anne Hathaway, we all saw the trailers with her shaved head making us think ""Wow, that looks intense"", I was left wondering, why was she even in the musical, she had such a MINUTE part, why bother shaving all of her hair off if she only has around 15 minutes screen time and dies anyways? Major spoiler - The little boy, when he got shot many people were very moved and saddened by this, I for one was not. He seemed to be intelligent for the most part of the film but around his death I just thought him an idiot. Picking ammo up when there are soldiers facing you and shooting probably is one of the most backwards ways to kill off a child in the history of indeed any musical/film, very disappointing and unrealistic.<br/><br/>I was constantly waiting for this AMAZING part of the film where I'd change my mind and clap my hands with tears in my eyes thinking what an incredible musical it is, it never happened. Some people clapped at the end, I was almost ready to laugh. I was severely disappointed with the musical, it did not live up to hype nor expectation. Good acting and whatnot but it just felt mediocre, not worthy of an Oscar at all. It felt bland and everything was overplayed so there was no interpretation. I can see why it's so famous because it's accessible to ANYONE with a brain ""Oh wow, I understand that, it's a musical therefore I believe I'm incredibly intelligent and cultured, wonderful!"""
"katie-cutshaw","3","6","12","19 January 2013"," If I could have fallen asleep for the last hour, it would have gotten more stars
","**SPOILER ALERT** I am trying to pinpoint just what it was that I didn't like about this movie. Its not that it was poorly done or a bad adaptation (I actually was impressed with this aspect). It could be one of two things; 1.) I'm just not a fan of the music of Les Mis or 2.) Russell Crowe murdered it.<br/><br/>I have always had a heart for musical theater but for some reason, was never really drawn to Les Mis. I love the story and I know it is quite celebrated, but I never took the time to really listen to the soundtrack and my experience with it doesn't go much farther than Liam Neeson so it could very well be that the music is just not my taste. I think its the constant singing with hardly any song distinction. But really, I think I could have looked past that (probably not for THREEE HOURS though) if it wasn't for Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>What I think is the main thread that holds this story together and drives it is the constant clash between Valjean and Javert. Valjean trying to find light and Javert being a constant reminder of his darkness. Javert's passion to honor his post and Valjean's passion to become a better man. That chase is the heart beat to this story. Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of Javert pulsed through the 1998 version and Crowe, though a very good actor, was so deadpan that I couldn't invest myself. It wasn't believable that he would dedicate his life to catching this man that slipped through his fingers and even less believable that he would end his life over it. Maybe he lost himself in the musical aspect but he bored the hell out of me. And without that spark, I think everything else fell pretty flat. I didn't.feel.anything. And I wore waterproof mascara just for this occasion.<br/><br/>This musical didn't have that POWER that courses through musicals, especially dark ones like this. That intensity that makes you tear up even when nothing is happening other than a bunch of people singing together in a market place. I went looking for that rush and came out scratching my head and wondering where the last three hours of my life had gone."

","Most people may not be good at spotting this but if your social circle includes actual singers you'll know what I'm referring to. The acting was good but the vocals killed the movie for me. It was also a little too slow for my personal taste. The movie score itself was obviously superb, can't really argue about that.<br/><br/>On a side note: as others eluded the actual musical (the original) is superior in almost every aspect. But if you're into ""mediocre singing"" this movie might be just what you're looking for (it sure made me cringe a couple of times when Russel Crowe opened his mouth).<br/><br/>Final remark: sometimes more is more (especially when it comes to post-production editing in terms of the audio).<br/><br/>p.s. not all vocal performances were equally bad. Some were OK but sadly Russel Crowe and Hugh Jackman's performances undermined the entirety of the few good performances, I'm afraid."
"Mobithailand","5","4","7","18 April 2016"," Rule number one is to get people who can sing.
","Firstly let me say up front that I am a huge fan of musical theatre, and if pushed would concede that 'Les Mis' is probably my all-time favourite musical, edging just ahead of other favourite shows such as Evita, Miss Saigon, Cats and West Side Story and Carousel. I have seen it twice in the West End of London and have watched concert performances of the musical countless times on DVD's, both the Royal Albert Hall anniversary concert and the more recent 'O2 Arena' anniversary concert. Both are fabulous shows to watch and listen to on TV and the music is inspiring as ever. It was therefore with tremendous anticipation and excitement that I went to see Les Miserables – the movie, especially as it had received a great number of rave reviews.<br/><br/>Sorry folks – I was really disappointed. By far and away the main reason for my disappointment was the woeful miscasting of the lead roles – particularly Russell Crowe as Javert and Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean. For some totally mind boggling logic, the producers chose fame over singing ability. This is the musical which probably more than any other, requires truly exceptional, professional singers in the lead roles. Frankly, it would have been better if proper singers were used to lay down the sound-tracks and these two karaoke 'also runs' mimed to the singing. After all, Natalie Wood got away with it in West Side Story. Hugh Jackman, while admittedly singing more or less in tune, is extremely pedestrian in every one of the towering, emotionally demanding songs. His whiny, nasally, weak voice just didn't cut it – at all! I bet your local amateur dramatic group could have come up someone who could give a better performance. As for Crowe! The least said about his singing the better. Let me just say that one of my all-time favourite songs from the show is ""Stars"", and when sung by a half way decent tenor, it never fails to move me to tears. Crowe's rendition only brought me to tears of despair and sorrow at the desecration of such a beautiful, inspiring piece of music. The man cannot sing worth a damn!<br/><br/>I can't really comment on the 'close-up' filming, the live recording of vocals or the overall direction of the movie – I suppose it seemed to come across OK – because I was just too blown out by the terrible singing to be able to think too much about anything else, or take an objective view about what I was watching. <br/><br/>And let's not for one moment try to argue that stage musicals can never make good film musicals as that is patently untrue. I recently re-visited the movie Evita with Madonna in the lead role, and say what you will about Madonna, but she really lifted her game in Evita and performed magically. Antonio Banderas as Che Guevara and Jonathan Pryce as Peron were also brilliant choices and sang their hearts out to perfection.<br/><br/>The film version of Evita should have shown any budding filmmakers just how to adapt a stage musical for the silver screen. Evita is so much better than Les Miserables in every conceivable way. And just in case you think that Evita, (1996), is the exception, I would refer you to multiple Oscar winners like Oliver, (1968), and the still incredible West Side Story, (1961). It can be done, but rule number one is to get people who can sing – or if not, dub them! 'Nuff said!"
"dinalt10","1","4","7","18 September 2015"," Just miserable
","Ideally this would be zero out of 10, the 1 is purely to satisfy the comment criteria.<br/><br/>I loved Les Miserables on stage, and have a few soundtrack recordings. The 25th anniversary DVD was and is stunning.<br/><br/>So how did they get a big screen production so wrong, especially after the excellent big screen version of 'Phantom'.<br/><br/>Perhaps the magic of Les Miserables doesn't translate to the big screen.<br/><br/>Or probably it was tragic miscasting for the roles. To hear most of the cast ruin classic songs, and for set pieces like 'Master of the house' to be trashed is galling. In fact hearing Borat 'sing' it like he's auditioning for 'allo 'allo utterly ruined it for me. At least nobody else attempted a 'comedy' French accent.<br/><br/>The only highlight of the film was Samantha Barks, who sang and acted perfectly.<br/><br/>Which begs the question, why did they not cast actors and addresses from the stage shows ? The show is a worldwide phenomenon, and packed with vocal talent.<br/><br/>Hopefully this will be a warning for any future musical adaptations. DON'T rely on a big name cast, as a musical lives and dies on vocal ability.<br/><br/>If you loved the stage show then avoid this turkey. Invest in the 25th Anniversary DVD instead."
"Nessi-3","10","4","7","16 February 2013"," Simply perfect! But you'll probably hate it, if you don't know the musical...
","I saw the musical some time ago in London and back then bought the soundtrack. Listening to it quite often, I know the soundtrack by heart. Going to a Swiss preview, I was very excited to see how the stage musical was transformed into a musical adaptation for the screen. As well I nearly expected to be disappointed. Far from that: I was touched in every single scene and even moved to tears in some scenes, what happens very rarely to me... The cast is excellent as well as their singing. The choice of actors and actresses is very convincing. The mood of Paris in the 19th century seems to be very accurate or at least how we expect it to be. A true gem among filmed musicals! Although it was a pity that Gavroches 'Little people' was cut short.<br/><br/>One drawback: I think people who don't know/like the musical will not like the movie because it's in general the stage version brought on the screen."
"abcvision","8","4","7","4 February 2013"," Old school ""occupy"" movement
","I have seen the stage version of Les Misérables and must say the movie version has taken it to a whole new level. It is absolutely amazing the way they took it from the stage to the big screen. The uprising of the lower class reminded me of a modern occupy movement that the ""Misérables"" stated ""we are not going to take it anymore"". It has all the elements of a good story, a love interest, jealously, and a clash to the death. Hugh Jackman, as Jean Valjean carried this film and did a top job. It was funny to see Russell Crowe sing as that is a role I usually don't think of him in but he did it. Anne Hathaway as Fantine did well but Amanda Seyfriend emotions ran through. I totally did not expect to see Sacha Baron Carter whose role as Thénadier was a caricature of his normal self. Take a visit to old France and fall in love with Les Misérables, this is sure to become a modern classic."
"typo202","10","4","7","27 January 2013"," Highly Enjoyable. Would recommend it to anyone.
","I loved this film.<br/><br/>I would not of thought that such a thing could be humanly possible but it is. After all I do not count myself as a massive musical fan or a fan of the original source being either the book or the musical. Having nether seen the musical or read the book, I wasn't sure as what to think about the story as what I had heard was mainly synopsis from IMDb or other such websites.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised at how detailed the story actually was. Which is nice considering at what low expectations I had of the story on a whole. <br/><br/>The film stands apart from the most modern film musical with the largely incredible performances from the cast. Which rest on the shoulders of an incredible Hugh Jackman. But the supporting characters of the film have some quite incredible performances. Most namely Eddie Remane and the incredible Anne Hathaway. <br/><br/>Tom Hooper show's what a talented director he truly is. Demanding incredible performance's from all of the cast. Which is what he gets no question. But also the way in which he shoot's this film. From the long close up's he uses to the incredible swooping shoots that shows just how amazing the spectacle of Les Miz truly is. <br/><br/>All in all. I was not expecting to like this film as much as did. But came out of it with a tear to my eye but also throughly enjoying this film."
"d-bunsee","9","4","7","26 January 2013"," Go and see it!
","Excellent film in most respects; the singing is exceptional and performances intense and very believable. There are however two exceptions to this - the Thernadiers are miscast leading to the ruining of Master of the House. This is a rousing song with very clever words which were lost in the film by poor delivery and not helped by the fussy camera work during it. You have to see it performed by Alun ARmstrong to really appreciate it.<br/><br/>Having said that the orchestrations are to die for and the performances by Ann Hathaway and Hugh Jackman are first class and deserve awards as does direction and settings and costume. A 'must see' film."
"flickernatic","8","4","7","21 January 2013"," Les Miserables - c'est formidable!
","I am not a great enthusiast for 'musicals' but having seen and enjoyed the stage production of Les Mis way back when, we decided to give the movie a try. I'm glad we did. <br/><br/>The film starts with a bang as the camera swoops into a French naval shipyard where bedraggled convict labourers struggle to haul a huge galleon into dry dock. From there on the action moves at a brisk pace as the story of love and liberty unfolds over the next two-and-a-half hours of visual excitement and stirring songs.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly excellent with Hugh Jackman, in the lead role of Jean Valjean, outstanding. Some critics have disliked the singing, but I thought it was always adequate and sometimes superb, a considerable achievement given that there was no studio recording or dubbing. Certainly the singing is vastly better than the awful efforts from Brosnan and Streep in Mamma Mia! That these are not operatic performances added to the reality of the story for me. However, the 'sung speech' became a little monotonous in parts, where everything seemed to be sung in five- or six-word phrases. <br/><br/>Even so, an exceptional movie, well worth seeing - my wife detests musicals but she loved Les Miserables! <br/><br/>(Viewed at The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK 20.01.13)"

","I had never seen any stage-version of Les Misérables. I had only heard Two songs from it; ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and ""Bring Him Home"" But still, my expectations were pretty high. And the Movie lived up to all the hype! There are plenty of Amazing performances in this. Hugh Jackman gives one of the best performance I've seen in my life! Russell Crowe has gotten a lot of undeserved criticism. His singing voice is actually very good! And his performance is incredible! Anne Hathaway is not in the film that long, but the time she is in it, is amazing! Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thernadiers are really funny! They give the film much needed comic relief. All the other actors are also amazing, but I won't take time to mention them all. They're all Great!!!<br/><br/>The film is full of really powerful moments. I Highly Recommend This film to everyone who likes musicals, and to everyone who likes movies!!!"

The moment he puts the cross on the young boy is touching and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Jackman has never been better as Valjean and the years of looking over his shoulder is evident with the make up and the genuine pain he has throughout the film.<br/><br/>But obviously, Hathaway is the best thing here, even though she is barely in it, her story and performance stay with long after she has gone, and long after the film. Her rendition of 'I dream a dream' has to be the best thing I have saw on the big screen for a while. She will win the Oscar for that alone.<br/><br/>Cohen and Carter provide the comic relief, and they make for great side characters.<br/><br/>The love triangle is all a little bit rushed in my opinion, and the director focuses more on the revolution and Crowes array of hats.<br/><br/>But all in all, its a must see, and I was swept away with it all.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

"Kicino","9","4","7","16 January 2013"," A perfect combination of musical and movie
","I have never cried so much in a movie yet I felt great crying, weeping or blinking away tears watching this movie. There was this strong sense of community with human compassion when I heard people around me searching for tissue papers or wiping tears or sobbing. It is alright to cry in a movie and I felt comfortable crying with them. It was also great I chose a late show so that I could go home right afterwards without walking around with red eyes.<br/><br/>I have never read Hugo's original but that did not prevent me from appreciating the story and admiring his confidence in and love for humankind. I have seen the musical years ago but this movie made that production bland and unimpressive. Tom Hooper has demonstrated a perfect combination of musical and movie and made this epic a masterpiece. I can watch it and listen to the songs over and over and never get tired of it.<br/><br/>It is a tragic story and we cried but we felt great watching it because out of this intriguing chaos there is something noble about the human race which gives us hope and keeps us going. <br/><br/>The story itself is simple yet so rich that it inspires you to think what is important – survival, forgiveness, salvation, compassion, help, trust, love, justice, morality, revolution, sacrifice, fairness, liberty, hope, and death. Yet, without the songs and music, these themes could not have been explored and yet leave you enough room to ponder, absorb and be moved. With the live singing and close-up of intense emotions, the production easily moves you into tears and laughter. <br/><br/>The singing was simply beautiful. I was not sure if it was their heavenly voice, or their emotions, the music, or the situations in the story that moved me. I cried when Fantine (Anne Hathaway) sang about her lost dream, when little Cosette (Isabelle Allen) sang of her castle in the cloud, when Eponine (Samantha Barks) sang of her loneliness and love in her mind, when Marius (Eddie Redmayne) sang of his lost friends and of course in the last scene. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is unbelievable. I almost did not recognize him when he appeared in the workshop. Then again when Cosette grew up he seemed transformed into another person. Yet throughout the movie, the determination in his eyes was powerful and unforgettable. <br/><br/>Anne sang beautifully and she just swept the audience away at every frame she appeared and every note she sang. It was such a pity that her appearance was so brief. <br/><br/>When little Cosette first appeared, I felt OMG, she is exactly like the sad girl in the poster! The sadness in her eyes made your heart ache. Then she sang and it sounded like an angel! Yet you could also feel her longing and hoping for a perfect world. <br/><br/>All the cast were great. In comparison, Russell Crowe seemed to be less impressive although he did well. Even when there was no character struggle, the singing and visuals were simply entertaining. You will not notice time has passed as it is simply captivating. I am now looking for the sound track and DVD. Just hope HMV does not close down so soon."
"gstuteley","9","4","7","16 January 2013"," Brilliant reworking for the big screen
","LES MISERABLES 150113<br/><br/>This is a film on an epic scale! The plot-line is simple enough. Jean Valjean was young and desperate when he committed a petty crime. Nineteen years of brutal punishment at the hands of a god-fearing but heartless officer not only fail to reform him, but leave him wanting to hit out at his fellows. An act of great human kindness from a gentle priest is enough to turn his life round and he spends the rest of his life trying to live a good life and help his fellow man. A series of coincidences that might make even Dickens blush help or hinder his progress.<br/><br/>The staging of this film is fantastic, with realistic images of early 19th century France recreated in and around 21st century London (e.g. Greenwich Naval College) and the studio. The soundtrack is impressive (I had a blocked ear and was still nearly deafened) with thrilling chorals and concussive gun and canon fire. The acting was pretty impressive, although you really ended up focusing on the two Oscar nominees. I first came across Hugh Jackman in ""X-Men"" and thought at the time that was more than just an ""action hero"". Here, Jackman really makes you believe in his character: his gaunt appearance at the start is startling and you can feel the primal brooding menace of the unreformed Valjean. His tortured metamorphosis into kindly agent of good is also realistically portrayed. He is equally convincing as the gaunt convict and the esteemed Mayor. It is award-winning stuff indeed. And his voice - what a revelation! This guy can sing. At first, I was not sure, but when he really let rip, it was not only heartfelt, but beautiful. Likewise Anne Hathaway: she can certainly sing and has a lovely rich and powerful voice. She is only on screen for about 20 minutes, but in that short time manages to deliver a performance of rare quality. She communicates perfectly to the audience, a naïve, gentle, kind person being overwhelmed and crushed by events and an uncaring society.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the other players. Russell Crowe is suitably determined and case-hardened as the ""righteous"" Javert. His voice is a fairly strong baritone and he copes pretty well. Eddie Redmayne is engaging as the young Marius and has a sweet tenor voice. Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) is fair with delicate complexion and sings sweetly, whilst Samantha Barks (Eponine) is dark and rustic with a much more earthy (but richer) voice). Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter provide the comic relief as the pantomime villains, the Thenardiers. <br/><br/>How does this rank with the stage musical? It is very difficult to compare. This was deliberately NOT an attempt to create ""the film of the stage musical"". It was an attempt to create a film that was based on the stage musical. It might sound like splitting hairs, but the difference is huge. For a stage musical, you are there to hear the beautiful songs and voices. For an action film, you want great action, great acting, great sets, great continuity and this brilliant film achieves all these, with a little sacrifice of vocal excellence. So - better or worse? I am going to duck out and say ""different""!"
"paul-morriss","9","4","7","13 January 2013"," Best musical conversion to date
","Les Miserables is like the 2004 Phantom of the Opera conversion in that it is faithful to the stage show, although a few lyrics have been changed and additional set pieces added.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackson, Russel Crowe both take on the leads well, although Anne Hathaway stole the show for me in terms of 'big Hollywood Stars'. The sets are huge and impressive and no expense spared. <br/><br/>In my opinion there is a massive gulf in quality between the stage performers and Hollywood stars, with Éponine (Samantha Barks) giving such an amazing performance.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the stage show and was really pleased with what was done."

Riveting and emotional is the best I can summon up. Anne Hathaway for me takes my top award - for the part as a whole, but 'I dreamed a dream' was incredible.

Les Mis is easily my favorite musical of the past 30 years - and I really know it inside and out - so like many I've been on tenterhooks waiting to see the big screen version. And it is great - mostly.<br/><br/>The story of Jean Valjean, a victim of heavy justice who discovers redemption and his journey that finally leads up to the barricades of a Paris student uprising in the late 1820 is told with verve and assurance.<br/><br/>It is moving and well done. The younger cast in particular shine with heart and vigor. (I did have a problem with two songs that were absolute showstoppers on stage and both were curiously underwhelming in this reviewers opinion.) All in all, this is a unique and interesting interpretation and as nearly everyone else has noted it is not a straight from stage to screen adaption that tries to reimagine the soliloquies and internal dialogs in a far more intimate way.<br/><br/>Considering it was the film I was most looking forward to it was a great experience....mostly...."

","This was an amazing movie. For me what made it so interesting was how difficult it must have been to act and sing at the same time with a camera right up front. Russell Crowe was perfect in the part of Javert and had a great Baritone voice. The opening scene when they were pulling the ship into the dry dock was really cool, imagine what it must have been like to build ships in those days. Hugh Jackman toiling in the bottom of the dry dock reminded me of Ben Hur in the guts of the Roman Galleon. It was hard to believe that these actors were not professional singers, they were all so great. The scenes in Paris were recreated extremely well. I can just imagine what the barricades must have been like. I guess my favourite song was by Samantha Barks who played Éponine. I must admit I am biased toward anything French, having grown up in Québec. Where would we be without Descartes and Fourier!"
"joshua-welsh","10","4","7","10 January 2013"," Les Miserables - So sad, it's good!
","I have seen this movie twice already and hope to go again before it comes out on DVD. The first time, I teared. The second, I cried. (Maybe because my mother was with me and she's more emotional?) The fact is it is a truly amazing musical. A GREAT story, AMAZING songs and an AWESOME cast and crew. What makes this a strong, uplifting film is that the actors actually payed more attention to the acting aspect rather than the singing (where they can probably fix it up in the studio).<br/><br/>The point is that it is a really emotional film. I rarely cry at movies except at one where the director makes you feel for the characters, (such as Jonathan Larson's Rent). Tom Hooper did exactly that and I'm sure everyone else who has seen the film will already agree. Every time I'm working, I notice that there is always someone walking out of the theatre with tears in the eyes or still continuing to try to get over the outcome of the movie and its characters.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman does an outstanding, superb job as playing the courageous Jean Valjeant, Russel Crowe really surprises the audience with his singing voice and the bad-ass crooked policeman Javert, while Anne Hathway plays a wonderful Fantine, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette (which still plays a decent actress almost the same as Sophie from Mamma Mia!) the boys like Eddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit as Marius and Enjolras make you want to fight for their cause, and last but not least, the perfect comical duo Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers. Samantha Barks also played a wonderful Epenine as she did in the Broadway musical.<br/><br/>This film is recommended for all ages. For the drama, comedy and musical people at heart, it serves its purpose in showing how Les Miserables were truly miserable!"
"thefilmdiscussion","9","4","7","7 January 2013"," ""Les Miserables"" is a thundering, emotional wallop
","Tom Hooper's emotional wallop of a film is easily the biggest spectacle in recent years. It's a lavish musical that hasn't been seen since ""Chicago"" took a stab at it back in 2003, complete with intricate and ornate sets, lush costumes, and of course, singing. Lots of singing. In fact, there's only singing, and while it may take a bit of getting used to, the skill and expertise of the actors is put on display in a rare and marvelous way that no one dare not appreciate. The film, based on both Victor Hugo's sprawling novel as well as the famed Broadway production, takes us into 19th-century France, where Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) after he breaks parole, agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's (Anne Hathaway) daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), a fateful decision that changes all of their lives forever. Throw in a couple of hilarious scene-stealing performances by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, and a solid turn by young Eddie Redmayne, and you've got a a minor casting miracle on your hands. What makes this film really stand out among musicals is the choice to use live singing on set. No voice-overs or dubbing of any kind here. Every word and note are presented as they were sung on set, raw and true. The result is both refreshing and gritty, lending a darker edge to a usually uplifting genre. While the title may suggest great sadness, the power and triumph and beauty of life in this grand film cannot be overcome, and I challenge anyone to emerge from this film feeling ""miserable"".<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"
"boblangill","9","4","7","9 January 2013"," If you love the story, you won't be disappointed with this movie.
","Les Miserables is often called France's national story, but it's a story the whole world loves. So, its story's a winner, but what does this movie bring to its telling?<br/><br/>All the key elements of the musical have been kept. The movie does add two things at the start that the play could not. Views of the French countryside let us see how far the government could reach to continue hounding Jean Valjean. More importantly, Hugh Jackman shows us a dirty, wounded beast of a man. Jean Valjean's papers labeled him a dangerous man, and his injured spirit and anger made him more dangerous than even he knew. This makes the transformation by kindness that much stronger.<br/><br/>This movie also brings in a tad too many shots of singing heads. Cinematography should be something you notice only after watching the movie. I noticed it, but this wasn't enough to derail my enjoyment as I watched. This movie develops the story at a good pace: moving along without rushing things. <br/><br/>Some have criticized the vocals. I'll admit, if this movie was ""Javier Sings,"" it would have fallen short of a good experience. On the other hand, with Russell Crowe's force of presence, his raw vocal style complements his performance. Overall, the staging, the pacing, and the acting enforce the drama of its music.<br/><br/>Les Miserables is one of the great stories of the human spirit, and this movie delivers its full impact."
"rannynm","10","4","7","8 January 2013"," Loved seeing the world of Les Miserables on a grand scale. It is exactly as I imagined. When it was over I wanted to see it again immediately.
","The epic musical Les Miserables tells the story of a man named jean Valjean played by Hugh Jackman set during the dawn of the French revolution. After serving 19 years as a slave because he stole a loaf of bread, he breaks parole and spends years reinventing himself as a new man. Jean is being hunted by officer Javert played by Russell Crowe, who swears he will not rest until Jean is behind bars. While running from Javert, Jean Valjean finds himself caring for a factory workers young daughter, Cosette. The young child changes his life forever.Les Miserables is honestly one of the greatest films I have ever seen. This film is almost three hours long and I still wanted it to go on longer. Les Miserables is a very well known Broadway musical and it stays so true to the play it is unbelievable. Not a single word is off. However, the one thing that changes for the better is they made the movie easier to understand and follow. I have been a huge fan of Les Mis for a long time and I know almost every single song by heart. I was trying so hard not to start singing along with the film, the musical score was amazing. The whole film is better than I could have ever hoped for, but seeing this tale up on the big screen was phenomenal! The visuals and special effects are truly breathtaking. It is set in France at the beginning of the French revolution when life for the poor was awful and life for the rich was grand. They capture the hard times of the streets perfectly by using dark colors and wonderful lighting contrasts. I loved seeing the world of Les Mis on a grand scale and it is exactly as I imagined it would be. I love this entire movie so much that when it was over I immediately wanted to see it again. I'm definitely going to see it again when it comes out in theaters. I have so many scenes that I love so much, but my favorites are the Lovely Ladies scene and the Master of the House scene. I like the Lovely Ladies scene because that's where Fantine, Cosette's mother turns to the streets as a home after losing her job at the factory. It is a wonderful musical number and Anne Hathaway's performance is amazing! It is so historically accurate showing how people would do anything to make a quick penny from selling their teeth, to chopping off their hair, it was hard for everyone. I also love the Master of the House scene because it is so hilarious. It has Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the innkeeper and his wife. They con people into staying the night at their inn, then trick them into never leaving. They are so crafty and hilarious and they rob everyone blind. This scene is so clever and hilarious. Sacha and Helena make an amazing duo. I love all of the characters equally, but I'll only pick a few to talk about. Jean Valjean is a truly amazing character and Hugh Jackman brings him to life so well. Hugh's talents are really shown off during this film and I was very impressed by him. Fantine, played by the remarkable Anne Hathaway is a very memorable character. Anne is perfect as Fantine and this was, in my opinion, her best role. The last character that I really enjoyed is Eponine played by Samantha Barks. Eponine sings all of my favorite Les Mis songs and her incredible duo of A Little Fall of Rain with Eddie Redmayne. A little fun fact is that Samantha Marks played Eponine in the Broadway version of Les Mis. Overall, I give Les Miserables 5 out of 5 stars because it is truly the most amazing film I've seen in a long time and it far surpassed my expectations. This film is definitely for ages 13 and up because of the dark period it is set in and the violence and cruelty that occurs. Raven Devanney, age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
"daviddaphneredding","9","4","7","8 January 2013"," outstanding in so many ways
","In this cinematic operatic production of Victor Hugo's ma gnus opus, there is beautiful color, superb acting, and grand singing. The poor, miserable, and destitute people of early-eighteenth-century France are depicted well. Hugh Jackman came across well as the horribly mistreated Jean Valjean, and Russell Crowe was definitely cruel, heartless, and horrible as the mean Officer Javert. Anne Hathaway made you sympathize with her in her role as the anemic mother of Cosette, and the little Cosette was a heart-stealer, and you can't do anything but feel love and sympathy for her because of the mistreatment of her by the Thenadiers: it was easy to fall in love with her when she became a girl of roughly twenty years of age. While I did like the singing, it maybe made the movie comical in places. But again, It maintained my attention well and is bound to be one of Universal's most outstanding productions."
"DKosty123","9","4","7","6 January 2013"," Tom Hooper's Les Miserables
","I am very impressed that Director Tom Hooper who Directed ""The Kings Speech"" attempted this project. While I have never seen the live Broadway production, this is the most impressive musical I have seen in a long time. Since there are very few directors with any experience with musicals, that makes Hooper's ambition even more impressive.<br/><br/>It is strange the movie going public is so hung up on the stars that people complain - this one can sing, that one can't. Those kind of narrow minded individuals would miss this movie. I see from some reviews they already have.<br/><br/>The main goals of a musical are - does it tell the story? In the case of this movie- yes, it tells the story very well.<br/><br/>Are the songs and sequences staged to move the film through the story? Even though this is a long movie, yes that is how this movie proceeds.<br/><br/>Are the sets and backdrops a help to the story? Is the screen adaption well written? Are the real basics of who, what where when and how explained to the audience? From what I saw in a packed theater, yes, without a doubt.<br/><br/>I did not look up the cast for this movie before I went. Quite frankly, I went because I had heard so much a about how good the movie is. I honestly think from what I saw on the screen, you could have had almost any cast in front of the camera with Hopper Directing this script and the resulting film would still be outstanding.<br/><br/>That is what I say a great film is all about, great story, great sets, great direction, and based on great material. Victor Hugo was one of the great writers and this screen adaption proves it.<br/><br/>I do not see where any 1 person in this cast really carries the movie, but the story sure does. Because of that, when I saw the names on the screen at the end of the film, I was surprised. When they were on screen they were all in character. That is what a great film is all about."
"trodfar","9","4","7","6 January 2013"," Crying from the opening scene! True to the book! Live singing!!!!
","I had read Les Mis years ago and when I knew it was coming out as a movie, I did homage to Mr. Hugo and re-read the whole book before seeing it on screen. (I would recommend that anyone attempting to read the book read an abridged version. Hugo inter-disperses several lengthy, somewhat annoying essays on such topics as the development of the sewer system underneath Paris, a complete account of the battle of Waterloo, and a study on convent life. While this may prolong the sense of knowing the characters by taking such a LONG time to read the book-- one of the longest ever written-- for me, it does nothing for the plot, which superior in every way and perfect without all the padding). <br/><br/>I cried from the moment I saw Jean Valjean in his hideous and worn condition and through his sung prayer to God. When Fantine delivers the Song To End All Songs, I was covered in tears and sobs. When Enjolas and the other brave insurgents are dropped one by one like flies, I bled along with them. And when Jean Valjean sees the Angel Fantine bringing him to heaven as he dies, I could not see the screen. <br/><br/>Just a few quibbles: why the writers choose to omit certain very dramatic details in the storyline I do not know: the fact that Lavoche is an abandoned son of the Thendiers is ignored-- he being also sister to Eponine. The two little wandering brothers are also omitted (along with the unnecessary Azelma). I thought the the song ""Bring Him Home"" should have been sung in the sewer-- it would have made a greater impact if it had. Otherwise it was flat and unmeaningful where it was placed. I was not happy with the choice of Bonam Carter or Baron Cohen for the Thenadiers-- I heard Geoffrey Rush was being considered for Thenadier and he would have nailed it. Thenadier, moreover, is described as a short man, and The Thenadier as an ugly, bearded women-- hardly Ms Carter! Why also did they not color Valjean's hair white when it says clearly his hair went ""white overnight""? That would have added another macabre touch where so many others such details were realized. (I also did not appreciate the scene of some girl grinding in bed with Santa Claus-- young children are coming to see this movie and the groans of orgasm do not need to be heard either.) Eponine, to save Marius' life, is shot through the hand into her breast, yet they choose not to show this,which was significant and would have cost little to do in the prosthetic department. It would have been good to have even one shot of Fantine with Cosette when she was a baby, to show how much she loved her, as well as her momentary relationship with the young man-- otherwise the meaning of her selfless actions are not as poignant. Yes, she gets her teeth pulled, but it was her TWO FRONT TEETH-- I know Hathaway got ugly for the scene, but couldn't she cut her hair off AND sing with a hollow prosthetic device? Maybe that cannot be done but more should have been shown to show some spaces in her mouth. You imagine getting your teeth pulled-- without anesthesia- to help your daughter!<br/><br/>I am giving the movie only 9 stars because of these points, with which would have made it just perfect. Actors: Jackman better win the Oscar, even if Day-Lewis looks and acts just like Lincoln. Hathaway should win the Oscar for her song alone. Crowe, whom I love so much as an actor-- especially as John Nash, did an admirable job considering he is not a Broadway singer-- I did feel his performance was stifled-- he could have been Javert but not been stifled in every single way. There were moments where you see his cruelty to Valjean and they are excellent. Marius is sweetly played as he ought to have been. Cosette looks just like Cosette should, and sings like a Lark, a little bird, which was her nickname. Enjolas-- now this is a star in the making. This young man CAN SING, he had fire, if it was not his own blonde hair it was still gorgeous. The Thenadiers I already noted.<br/><br/>I cannot wait until this comes out on DVD-- it really was excellently done!!!! Live singing from now on in all movie musicals!!!!"
"browney-204-823899","10","4","7","5 January 2013"," Bravo!
","See full review (www.browney237.com)<br/><br/>There had been much discussion about Tom Hooper's direction and the fact that all songs were sung live. I wondered if this was to manage expectations down? From the opening scene in the shipyard with the sound of the water splashing and ""Look Down"" in semi muffled tones and the mountain scene you are quickly transported from stage to screen. <br/><br/>While neither Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe have the depth of voice that the roles on stage have traditionally command this is quickly overcome. They can both act and it's a movie so it genuinely works. Jackman's portrayal of a man wracked with guilt in the monastery sets the scene for a wonderful performance as Jean Valjean. <br/><br/>Much has already been written and said of Anne ""Give her the Oscar now"" Hathaway and how she quite simply steals the show. Her performance is breathtaking. I have listened and seen many versions of Les Miserables but nobody has and most likely will ever capture ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in way she does. It's raw emotion and simply takes your breath away. She isn't standing in front of a microphone belting it out, she is just sobbing her way through it accompanied by the audience.<br/><br/>Crowe's presence grows throughout the movie. He looks every inch the policeman and both his major songs ""Stars"" and ""Javert's Suicide"" are well done with a talk/sing style which works well for him. He isn't a weak link at all.<br/><br/>For me, the performances of Amanda Seyfried as Corsette and Eddie Redmayne as Marius were satisfying, whereas Samantha Barks as Eponine quite simply nailed it. <br/><br/>There is a very strong religious theme much more evident for me in the movie than in the stage production. I have simply been astounded how the line ""To love another person is to see the face of God"" has reverberated around the twittersphere. <br/><br/>Overall Les Miserables the movie is a success. It doesn't seek to be the stage show reproduced to fit the screen but seeks to define itself - bravo!"
"bjones","8","4","7","5 January 2013"," Surprisingly Powerful
","I had not originally planned on reviewing this film, or seeing it for that matter, it was just a routine night out with friends and I had little input as to the final destination. Sometimes it's just more fun to take a back-seat and enjoy the company of others. It ended with the kind woman sitting next to me trying to unobtrusively stuff tissues into my coat pocket. Saying that much, post movie, I just had to say something about it to someone who wasn't there. It's said that happiness shared is happiness multiplied; but, it's just as true that it's happier still to broadcast your joy to the heights. Having said that much : The total production of the film was bleak and depressing, to say the least, perfectly in keeping with the film's theme. The sets, costumes, makeup, art everything were all top-notch. It also helps to have actually read the novel. If you do you'll have a deeper understanding of the characters, motivations and the significance of the historical setting. Hugo was brutal.<br/><br/>What's left is to find performances by the cast you like. Wow, to start, it's undeniable that Anne Hathaway as Fantine, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, Russel Crow as Javert, and Eddie Redmayne as Marius were all tremendous. I have to mention Hathaway's performance was very moving. She gave real life and form to one of literature's most wretched characters. Crowe was exceptional as a classic villain cast into that position by life's uglier circumstances. Amanda Seyfried was breathtakingly beautiful as the story's corner post, being - at the same time - Fantine's downfall and Valjean's salvation.<br/><br/>As for the rest ... well ... ... it's hard to put into words really, but Hugh Jackman was nothing short of stunning in the lead; and stunning is too little praise for what I experienced. I had no idea he was such an incredibly talented singer. The film is not really a musical (does anyone else know the difference anymore?), it's a grand opera and Jackman, I think, could hold his own in most operas in the world he's that good. Wow. Amazing. The music had such power and passion it was impossible not to be moved. Now, I have to admit that I might be a touch biased, being a father of a grown, married daughter myself I can totally identify with his performance ... and ... a professional who should know once told me that I reminded her of Valjean in the book. But even with those biases it was still nothing less than a completely magnificent performance. At this point I am left drained and convinced that it was the most powerfully convincing performance I've ever witnessed by a man on film; or any other media for that matter. It even washed away the smarmy, slimy aftertaste from being subjected to Django Unchained the day before.<br/><br/>So, by all means, see Les Miserables. It is an uplifting paean to the soul of humanity and reflects that good can be found anywhere, even in the most unlikely of places. Thanks Hugh.<br/><br/>By Bruce L. Jones<br/><br/>http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/"

","Having seen Les Miserables on multiple occasions in London, when I heard a musical version was being brought to the screen, it worried me. I then heard Tom Hooper was directing and instantly that worry turned to excitement. I cannot tell you how much I loved this movie. It is a near perfect adaptation of musical with a dream cast that brings this timeless story to the silver screen with such finesse and beauty. I left the theater speechless and in awe of the talent and production that went in to this motion picture event. Do yourself a favour, don't wait for the DVD. Watch this on the biggest screen with the best sound you can find. An unforgettable experience awaits."

I've watched it already. Now I can see all the ladies sniffle and weep!""<br/><br/>But damn, when I watched it this second time, I COMPLETELY LOST IT, and I'm still trying to figure out why. (I'm a guy by the way.)<br/><br/>And that, my fellow readers, is what's so brilliant about this movie.<br/><br/>Frankly, I can't even remember the last time a movie was so successful at making even tough guys like me cry.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the movie in this review, because if you like great music... and if you want an emotional ride... then really... you should go watch it if you haven't already.<br/><br/>The singing was excellent. Some people didn't like Russell Crowe's singing, but I thought he was just fine. It's just that he isn't very ""Russell Crowey"" in terms of singing lol.<br/><br/>The acting was perfect, especially from Hugh Jackman. Don't believe me?

"bridgetschmal","7","4","7","31 December 2012"," A 3D musical in 2D
","Honestly, I wanted to LOVE this movie. But I only liked. It is at most a 2D movie representation of live theatre first of all, so that is a strike against it. I found Hugh Jackman's singing in the first hour slightly sharp in parts and since he was not recorded with an orchestra, it almost makes me think he was recorded with an out-of- tune piano and then the orchestral version added back. And the high ranges of Amanda Seyfried's voice sounded distractingly screechy. <br/><br/>I will say that listening to Anne Hathaway sing was refreshing after Hugh Jackman. And who knew Russell Crowe could sing in such a rich, clear (and in tune!) voice? He, Samantha Barks, and Eddie Redmayne were standouts for me.<br/><br/>Anyway, everyone knows the music and the storyline, the set portrayals were good, and acting was believable. I can imagine producers saying do we hire singers or stars; they clearly decided on stars. I love musicals, and usually Hugh Jackman too, but maybe stronger true singers would have been better as Valjean and Cosette."

"owlman-4","10","4","7","31 December 2012"," What an outstanding production!
","I didn't really know what to expect. We are very familiar with the play and all of the music and have heard some of the best performances anywhere--namely, Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean. The movie has to be taken on its own terms. You can't go expecting the quality of singing performances heard on Broadway, but if you don't have that expectation, then just sit back and let the movie do its thing, you will find a remarkable translation of the play to the big screen. The performances were stellar and overcame the lack of singing prowess by some of the lead characters. This movie is totally gripping, but in spite of the sometimes dark subject matter, you will leave the theater feeling rejuvenated and hopeful.<br/><br/>A wonderful experience!"
"Rebel_With_A_Cause_94","8","4","7","29 December 2012"," A Great Musical
","As someone who has never seen the stage adaption (or any adaption that is), I really enjoyed this. While some fans have complained about it, I really loved Tom Hooper's direction and cinematography. It was visually stunning to look at and really helped captured the incredible scope of the project. All of the performances are great here. It's been a while since i've seen a film with such raw and emotional performances. Normally in a musical, there's at least a few numbers that I don't care for, but here I enjoyed all of them and can't really think of any that irritated me or that I disliked. Some I enjoyed more than others, but none of them I disliked. I really enjoyed the story as well, but felt like it would've been easier to follow if I had been familiar with the story before hand like I can imagine most who are going to see this are. If I really have any other complaints, I did feel that the start of the 2nd act was a little shaky where the film lost it's focus on the main story and fell into focusing a bit more on a relationship between two characters a bit more than I felt it needed too. I also felt that some exchanges of dialouge that were sung between the numbers came off as rather comical and would've been better if the actors had communicated without singing their lines. Still, a great musical and one of the better ones i've seen"

","Who are these people giving this movie low ratings and scathing reviews? This is a brilliant and moving adaptation of the stage version!<br/><br/>My mother is a vocal coach, and even she had nothing to say regarding the singing except for Amanda Seyfried as Cosette (her voice felt very weak). Hugh Jackman did Valjean justice, and Marius (Eddie Redmayne) was my favorite by far.<br/><br/>To those people complaining about the close camera angles, I think he did it because when you see it on stage, you're too far away to see the emotions. He wanted to capture every agonizing moment.<br/><br/>This movie adaptation is moving, touching, at times amusing, and very very well done. I gave it nine stars because of missing verses in songs and a confusing song addition."
"EvaCross","10","4","7","28 December 2012"," Art at its maximum expression
","Expect to find something like Moulin Rouge, Chicago and Across The Universe, but this is not ""a Disney movie"" where there are about 14 or 17 songs - like in the movies mentioned - and the rest is a normal film dialogs, negative. Here the songs are 95% of the film. It's a musical as it is that of Joseph with Donny Osmond, only that this is a film that I mean. The development, setting, production, is 10, a lot of money, for many good effects, but the sense of the whole movie is totally theatrical, the proof is uncut planes often demonstrating an impeccable ability action of the protagonists. Being all sung, at times you can be ""heavy"". But it's all part of what a real musical form, an orchestral score, a single track from start to finish with its ups and downs, their different situations, different moments, culminating as any other piece of music ends, but clinging tightly their history, their characters, their thoughts and their small recreation of the world that we see.<br/><br/>A production level we have a winner in every way. All design, effects, settings, costumes, is totally believable, dirty, filthy, beautiful, crisp ... I think the film is reaching impeccable levels from 2010 onwards. From now on I think not ""get off"" again, I do not see how to improve production at a product like this nor saw how to improve production at Inception. All that remains to improve almost adjoins subjectivity. Performances, script and story, and music. The rest, visually there are many things that seem almost perfect. At least I repeat, I do not see where or how to improve a product like this.<br/><br/>The script and story are superb. This would not be thanks to Tom Hooper (director) I suppose, because it is the adaptation of a product already made in the form of music. It's a classic in my opinion, very well told, very long ... one of those stories as long as life itself, you can not impute anything, because they have left almost no detail, such as The Notebook or Men of Honor in my opinion, characters level, know the level inside the personalities of each, simply explain almost everything that has to explain to us to maintain a relationship of self-identification in the characters (some of us feel identified, some not, because we are all different in many ways). Some stories we might like less or more. Honestly, to this day, December 27, 2012, any story about the French Revolution and in general France had seemed boring stories where I never felt identified with anyone, and that appealed to me the least. That has changed now, thanks to Les Misérables.<br/><br/>Performances, decades pass and most concerning actions shall have Marlon Brando to name only one among several papers few behind, such as the monologue of this actor Apocalypse Now (not to dwell much more) , but we have new benchmark gentlemen. What they have done in this masterpiece Anne Hathaway (just do not see what is more interpretive actress Anne Hathaway for more than reviewing film history right now), Hugh Jackman and Eddie Redmayne alongside Russel Crowe has been a scandal, worthy mentioned for decades and decades. It was the perfect catch theater performance brought to the big screen, we, as the uncut long monologues that have been marked before other actors and the realism with which they have done. Anne Hathaway has been my vastly superior to all, and has been absolutely perfect PERFECT the fact that we see the subtitle of all songs depending on where the first plane to different sides of the character. Not always focused down, but to the left or right. I did not expect at all (international), and is the finishing touch to this magnificent and incredible photography, which sometimes reminded me Terrence Malick (not to mention others whose jobs basically unaware of ignorance). Anne Hathaway has made me mourn for the emotion, almost made it into a movie called underrated Love and Other Drugs where his performance is also superb. But what has been achieved in this film, I will not reveal, and thanks to perfect planning and many, many eggs by the actors, which in the theater is always present, but in the film we see little of, we observed that is probably the best scene in the whole year of film, and personally, of the best acted scenes and the best performances I've seen in my life. Like I said, it has made me mourn such action, so desperate, so sad, so angry and so much hope reflected in every pore of his body. Unsurpassed until proved otherwise.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is not far behind at all. Get the most out of his career without a doubt, and it is much to say for it is one of the successors in my opinion Brando, Heston, Eastwood and company. His best performance by far.<br/><br/>All the voices of all stakeholders, nuanced. Forced ... they put many balls as well have told me, I do not know if it is true, that all voices are prerecorded, but the scenes are sung and filmed at the same time. Are you kidding me?. If that is not credible to a musical, I do not know what the hell it is. An added plus to work so magnanimous.<br/><br/>All I do is give in to such a timeless masterpiece.<br/><br/>The makeup plays an important role throughout the play, as is every detail and every feature. But makeup for the characters ... so much ugliness, so old age. Other added more to this blockbuster. It's a film that honestly see very hard not to become history."

","After seeing many Broadway musicals ruined when adapted to the screen, I was weary about seeing Les Miserables, afraid that it would join the others in disaster. Les Miserables was most definitely a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Everything about this film was done tastefully, and beautifully, from the set design to the performances. There was not a single actor in this film whom I thought could be replaced with another. Hugh Jackman gave the performance of a lifetime in a role which I personally feel he deserves an Oscar for. Russell Crowe made one of the most sympathetic villainous characters I have ever seen, another performance I personally believe he deserves an Oscar for. Anne Hatheway had hardly a single scene she was in where she did not bring tears to my eyes, having perfectly portrayed every single emotion of a woman who has been beaten again and again. I enjoyed every single moment in which she was on screen.<br/><br/>Before seeing this film, if I were to describe to someone who Amanda Seyfried was, I would probably tell them ""She's the dumb chick in Mean Girls"" but from now on I would say to everyone ""She was the girl Cosette in Les Mis"" after making a small but significant part so beautiful and memorable. Samantha Barks, having little to no film experience prior to this film, should have a long withstanding career in her future, after such a beautiful and heart-wrenching performance in this film. <br/><br/>As I have said before in this review, there was not a single member of the cast which I felt was weaker than the rest. This film was beautifully done in every way. It is so very rare that I feel that a film is a ten out of ten, but I would give this film that exact rating, as it deserves. This is a must see film which I would see again and again and again, given the chance."

Empty Chairs at Empty tables did me in totally - he nailed it absolutely. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Russell Crowe but he was wonderful, and Hugh Jackman - what can I say.

Far more intimate than on stage - and containing an actual sense of story. In fact, while being superior to the stage play in terms of the immediacy of the experience, it couldn't have been more different in the way familiar scenes were captured and mounted with scene-setting that was not constrained by the limitations of the stage.<br/><br/>I applaud the film-maker. I applaud the director. I applaud the actors, particularly Mr. Jackman, Miss Hathaway, and Mr. Redmayne. Filming them as they sang was a brilliant stroke. It intensified both the singing and the acting, particularly in the most emotionally intense moments.<br/><br/>Brilliant. And, as to the high-brows, they probably still harrumph about the Wizard of Oz, remain so very dejected that Mary Poppins didn't have the dark tone of P. L.

It had so many small, subtle things done by actors that just blew me away. These actors went all out, and I love that, as previous reviews said, it focused on the actors and the story, not a lot of extra stuff. I don't get what's being said about confusing plots, I followed along just fine. There were some things I got slower than my friend, but he also knew more about the plot than me. Hugh Jackman really made me sympathize, though he did so good at being the ""strong"" character who had such a hard life and just kept going, without asking for anything in return, not even thanks from the man whose life he saved. Everyone in this movie was fantastic. I'd say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I can't wait to buy it. I've been telling everyone to see it, and I just saw it last night. In my town, people don't tend to laugh, cry, or applaud at movies in theater. I heard all three during this movie (laughing mainly during the silly scene in the inn), and it's the second movie I've been to here that got applauded. The first was The Artist, and it was a small applause from a large audience. This was a HUGE applause, from a small, tear covered audience. This movie is phenomenal, and I would recommend it to anyone."

","There are few musicals like ""Les Misérables,"" an operetta lined with incredible music from start to finish, with a story so grand and tremendous that somehow manages to fit on a Broadway (or West End) stage. <br/><br/>Needless to say, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil's story has been ripe for a film adaptation since the English version opened in London in 1985, a chance to place this larger- than-life production in an environment with no physical confines or limitations. With the keys in the hands of Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech""), one would expect something extravagant, but surprisingly, the Oscar winner chooses to do the opposite — to zoom in on the story and its characters in search of greater depth.<br/><br/>It's this choice that completely determines the effectiveness of this take on ""Les Mis."" As anyone familiar with the musical knows, you're not going to walk out of any film version disappointed with the music and lyrics or the quality of the overall story — they guarantee the film a certain measure of success. Instead, it becomes all about presentation.<br/><br/>Hooper's primary technique for telling this story is the close-up. If he and cinematographer Danny Cohen got any closer, in fact, you'd swear the camera would smack into the actors' faces. With so much of the music being sung by one character at a time — characters who are usually pouring their souls out — it makes sense, but there's little breathing room for the audience. Stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and more are literally right there; the makeup department had to be utterly scrupulous to be sure. <br/><br/>But Hooper doesn't just expose his actors physically, he also does so vocally. With the choice to film all the singing live on set as opposed pre-recording tracks in studio for the actors to lip-sync to, their voices become the object of audience scrutiny. With the lens so close on these characters, the actors had no margin for error in their performances, so it's truly a compliment to say that there is some truly incredible acting in ""Les Misérables.""<br/><br/>Jackman and Hathaway excel the most with this technique as Jean Valjean and Fantine, respectively. Valjean is the protagonist in this large ensemble, a man released from prison on parole for stealing a loaf of bread, who after remaking himself eight years later, promises the dying Fantine that he'll look after her daughter, Cosette (played later on by Amanda Seyfried). <br/><br/>Interestingly, their best work comes at the very beginning of the film. As the prison-worn down-on-his-luck Valjean who is given a second chance, Jackman sets the bar for the film's emotional intensity with ""What Have I Done?"" only to be outdone by Hathaway, who, despite minimal screen time, delivers the iconic ""I Dreamed a Dream"" with an intensity that really hammers home the lyrics in a way no previous renditions have ever done. It's incredible, though sadly it goes unmatched for the entire rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Young up-and-comer Eddie Redmayne as student rebellion leader Marius and West End starlet Samantha Barks as the street urchin Eponine also succeed when the camera fixes squarely upon them in their respective songs ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" and ""On My Own."" <br/><br/>As much as the close-ups really highlight and enhance the acting, some members of the cast struggle with it. Russell Crowe has a lot of trouble with Inspector Javert, both vocally (at the beginning at least) and emotionally. He's a tricky character who's hard to empathize with in the first place, and Crowe just seems uncomfortable during his two huge solos. <br/><br/>Opinions will vary on the overall sound of ""Les Misérables"" because of the choice to do on-set singing. Some lyrics become a bit lost when multiple people sing at once, and the actors generally choose to restrain their voices or even speak some of the lyrics rather than belt them, which given the choice and the film's intimate nature, makes sense. Great pitch is somewhat sacrificed for a raw quality that benefits the acting. The entire film is really built around the performances.<br/><br/>Usually, when a film doesn't quite have the emotional impact it should wield, it's a lack of introspection and intimacy that can be blamed, but in this case, it's when ""Les Misérables"" fails to get big enough that it lacks that power to hit all of the story's several emotional high points. We never get that big sense of scale because of Hooper's preoccupation with the characters and that intimacy. The wide shots in the film are mostly sweeping pans to establish change in time and location, and they're very effects-heavy. <br/><br/>It's odd, because what made ""The King's Speech"" such an excellent film from a technical standpoint was the way Hooper beautifully incorporated the scenery in almost every scene. The rich detail of the set decoration, props and costumes all came through. Here we can pretty much only judge the costumes from the waist up. Half the shots in the movie could've been filmed with actors not wearing pants and we wouldn't have known it.<br/><br/>The trade off is that we get some of the very best performances in a movie musical of all time. These are star-making turns for Redmayne and Barks, and when you stop to consider at any point in the film that the guy playing Valjean also plays Wolverine, you'll have a whole new level of respect for Jackman. He and especially Hathaway will wow you like no acting performance has in quite some time.<br/><br/>""Les Misérables"" has its missteps to be sure, but it's a worthy adaptation that utilizes its talent to impressively bring new insight to a stage musical heard and seen countless times all over the world.<br/><br/>~Steven<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! moviemusereviews.com"
"wujawa-1","7","4","7","26 December 2012"," Great performance. Not very good directing.
","A very well performance by the most of the cast member. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway deserve every award they have been nominated. Amanda Seyfried's voice is also surprisingly amazing. The set for the film is beautiful. Overall, a good entertaining for the price of a movie ticket.<br/><br/>The problem of this film is the directing....Did the director have to shoot every solo scene in a close, only above-neck angle? Most of the vocal solos we can only see the head of the actor. You can actually imagine that Hugh Jackman holding his iphone in front of him when he was singing and the filming was done by skype or facetime. Especially in the last few scene his camera seems to be too small to fit in 2~4 characters. I don't get this. Probably he was trying to create some first-row experience for the audience, but when this fixed and focus angle was used through out the entire film it starts getting me annoying and make the movies very flat even it has a great storyline and awesome performances.<br/><br/>I think it is a very well first-row entertaining experience. But this is not a very good movie."

","I am a massive musical fan and Les miserables it is my all time favourite musical even though i have never seen a professional company perform it live on stage. I have only see good quality amateur theatre companies and the 25th anniversary concert on DVD.<br/><br/>The movie was incredible and a great watch. Hugh Jackman is outstanding and he made the character his own. I was nervous about Anne Hathaway as i didn't know if she could sing - well she couldn't of played the part any better and deserves every award that hopefully comes to her. <br/><br/>As i am Australian i was proud that we had 2 Aussies playing leads in this movie but when i heard Russell Crow was playing javert i was a bit hesitant about the singing yes he looks the part and acted the part BUT the singing left a little to be desired a stronger voice was needed! <br/><br/>The rest of the cast was great with massive wraps on Eddie Redmayne on his role as Marius and Daniel Huttlestone for his role as Gavroche. A Must watch and it did the musical justice will be watching it again tomorrow."

","I will admit, I have waited a year for the movie adaption of ""Les Miserables"". Let me tell you it certainly was worth the long wait. I went to see it with my mother today as a Christmas gift to her from me. We settled in and allowed the big screen to take us away. <br/><br/>The story is about Jean Valjean, a convict who is freed after 20 years in prison and is chased by the policeman Inspector Javert. Throughout the chase, Valjean touches the lives of so many people especially Cosette-whom he later adopts from her late mother Fantine. <br/><br/>I won't go into major details. Just know that the music was incredible, the actors had all sung live. There was no pre-recording. This made it real, and raw which the audience will immediately see. You will fall in love with the characters and, yes, cry. But you're among friends as the whole theater may cry so you won't be alone. <br/><br/>The movies exceeded my expectations and if the actors, especially Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman do not win Oscars for their performance, there is something wrong with the world. <br/><br/>See this movie, you won't regret it. Be sure to grab a box of tissues before you enter, you'll need them."
"yveofdawn","10","4","7","25 December 2012"," Amazed.
","This was beautiful. First movie that really made me cry. I have to applaud the entire cast (yes, even Russel Crowe) for being so amazing. But I must say, the performance that really gave me chills was Redmayne's 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables'. I've been a long time fan of the musical, and I've been listening to Michael Ball's version my entire life and that was the first time I really, really felt the grief and pain in that scene. Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman most definitely deserve the praise they have been given, as well as Samantha Barks as a tear jerking Eponine. Amanda Seyfried brought some depths to Cosette that I'd never seen before. Russel Crowe's Javert may not have been stellar, but I believed him. I have seen a lot of reviews putting the directing down, with the extreme zooms on singers. I must say that I was worried about this, but to me it just gives a beautiful view of everything the character is feeling. A+. I can't wait to see it again."
"lheureuxjuliana","10","4","7","25 December 2012"," Perfectly Matches with the Play - Moving Performances
","Les Miserables, the movie opera, is a perfect tribute to the emotional magnetism of Victor Hugo's historic novel of early 19th century French Revolution, portraying the valor of one good man in the face of societal and historic turmoil. Indeed, the movie version is a hit, because the compellingly plot, one that transcends centuries, was kept in tact, consistent with the powerful mega hit opera that preceded the movie. Performances by Hugh Jackman as the valiant John Valjean, and Russell Crow as the powerfully righteous Javert, are realistic to their roles as mirror opposites and equal protagonist characters. I've seen ""Les Mis"", the stage opera, five times, including once in London, where it's justifiably a theater staple of London's West End. Therefore, I was skeptical about cinema weaknesses, but the movie exceeds expectations. It's magnificent. Ann Hathaway gives the breakout performance of her career as Fantine. Hathaway sheds her previous movie characters, as she bares her soul to the plot, playing the abused mother of the beautifully sympathetic child named Cosette (played as an adult by Amanda Seyfried). Cosette becomes a stunningly beautiful lady because Valjean intervenes into her dismal situation as a child orphan who was poorly cared for by the two crooked but comically played Thenardiere's (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter), an inn keeper couple who treat Cosette as child labor. ""Les Miserables"" is one of the greatest novels of modern history and the opera-play, now the stunning movie, are challenged to maintain the emotional integrity of Hugo's drama, as well as the strength of the iconic Valjean and Javert. Thankfully, the integrity of Hugo's story put to cinema is maintained. Although the music is beautiful, the singing voices of Jackman, Hathaway and Crowe do not equal those in the stage opera. On the other hand, Seyfried is perfectly cast in her role as Cosette. Eponine, the character played and sung by Samantha Barks, isn't as strong in the movie plot as her character appears in the stage version; nevertheless, she provides a powerful performance. Child actors Isabelle Allen, Natalya Wallace and, especially, Daniel Huttlestone give good performances, with Hugglestone excelling in his role. This movie will be loved by fans of the novel and the ""Les Mis"" stage opera. Those exposed to the story for the first time, or who are unfamiliar with Victor Hugo, may want to brush up on their literary history before enjoying this memorable movie. Victor Hugo could not have foreseen how his novel would extend the powerful moral intention of this historic saga well into the 21st Century."
"littlepheebs","7","4","7","23 December 2012"," Almost Perfect
","I had high expectations for this movie. I can't say that I was completely blown away, but I enjoyed it. In the end I thought it could have been better so I am giving it a 9. <br/><br/>I thought the acting was pretty good. Especially Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman. The one person I thought that could've done better was Russell Crowe. He acted well and his voice is good too. It's just when the two came together it was kind of fake. There was only one scene in the movie that I thought he pulled them both off. I really like Russell Crowe so I was pretty disappointed about that. <br/><br/>The singing was really good. Unlike other movies, this movie's singing is recorded live and that made the performances more real. I thought all the actors had great voices and the song ""Suddenly"" which was written for this movie was very good. I also thought Amanda Seyfried's singing had really improved since ""Mamma Mia"". I really enjoyed her performances.<br/><br/>I've heard people complaining about the horrible CG, but I honestly think it's not such a big deal. The CG was not the best, but it's the last thing that crosses your mind after you watch this wonderful movie. I enjoyed this film, even though I had expected more from it. It's one of those movie's that people will say was a turning point for musicals in the film industry. So I think it's a movie worth watching."

","A cold and rainy night seemed to be the perfect time to go see this movie. I have to say, my expectations were high. Although I never did quite understand the hype for the play, it was my hope that with such strong stars there would be a gem of a film here.<br/><br/>Boy, was I disappointed. I certainly don't understand the people who cried during this movie. Who in the world cared about any of these characters and why?? I could not for the life of me find one ounce of compassion for anyone in the film. It did not draw me in nor did it move me in any way except for out the door quickly back into the cold.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway did prove to be able to belt out a decent tune, and bravo to her for being seen gritty and ragged- she perhaps should receive a nod from the academy. Hugh Jackman proves again to be more than just an action figure. I did like seeing him in such a role. But for all their decent acting I could not have cared any less what happened to them or anyone else in this movie. A waste of time."
"lsterk","4","13","33","20 December 2012"," Don't confuse a great musical with a mediocre movie rendition
","When it comes to converting a famous stage musical to a movie, I expect the outcome to be more than what the stage version provides - great lyrics, great melodies, and great staging wrapped into a great experience. Otherwise, see the stage version! So I'm unhappy to report Hooper and company fail to fully embrace what movies can do and instead give us a half-breed of musical and film.<br/><br/>The opening number's awful CGI rendition seems intentionally lame as if to say we know a movie scene in 2012 could be more but we choose not to provide that experience. Same with the later rooftop scene with Javert's singing to the stars.<br/><br/>My distraction as to what this effort is adding to Les Miz's legacy was then compounded by the wait for opening credits which never came. Finally, you realize the curtain has lifted and what we are seeing is an overblown stage production except this time retakes were allowed! Geez, handed the opportunity to adapt possibly the greatest modern musical into a movie and that's what we get?<br/><br/>To its credit as a filmed stage production, I've always suffered thru ""Master of the House"" but not this time. Clever business, excellence in details, and great acting/singing by the three name duo of Cohen and Carter made that number finally worthy of its place in the show.<br/><br/>While much is made of the mega-stars, for my money Samantha Barks as adult Éponine shines brightest with her singing.<br/><br/>The most flattering thing my wife and I could say about the movie was we finally heard more lyrics in an understandable manner than ever before. There were a few chorus numbers with unintelligible voices and as always the duets and trios are near impossible to discern. If you don't know the lyrics, relax and enjoy the harmonious sounds of voices and orchestra together.<br/><br/>Warning to parents: The young rascal in the revolution dies a harsh death by gunfire; an untimely choice by Hooper given the recent slaughter of innocent school kids. Why was I not surprised the most movie-like aspect of the film was the gore and dying? When it came to violence, Hooper suddenly embraces film's ability to focus, zoom, and make you confront the images on the screen."

","My Mrs forced me to watch this. Seen it once and once alone. The very thought of another viewing of this film with smegma infested cum buckets singing throughout totally disgusts/horrors me, I'd rather watch a Bollywood romance with subtitles!! It really is a shocker! Now don't get me wrong, I'm partial to a good musical. Me and Mama used to have Mama- Mia on repeat on Sundays. This tho grates the skin like an acid hose down. I've almost filled my men's tena pants writing this as I feel so strongly about it. I'd sooner sign up for a diarrhoea eating competition than watch this again. I'd rather go back in time and be the milky bar kid and nephew of Jimmy Saville than have to sit through this one more time.

"ssagarwala0501","1","5","10","13 May 2013"," Wonderful story by Vicor Hugo, fails in the musical format
","I have never reviewed a movie on IMDb before but after seeing all the positive reviews (I did see some other reviews that agreed with mine but they were in the minority), I needed to write one. This movie is awful. Do not make Hollywood actors sing when they cannot. A musical should be with good singers and good songs and good music. This great story has been ruined by the musical format using Hollywood actors. This is a story that requires dialog and there is no need to sing every single line - it makes no sense. I heard the Broadway show was good and I am sure it was, but this movie is pretentious, tedious and I could barely sit through it. Of note, the previous Les Miserable starring Lieam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush was awesome. If you have not seen that, rent it instead; if you have, see it again - avoid this version at all costs!"

","Last night I got the chance to watch the sneak peek of this movie and couldn't wait till it was over with. <br/><br/>First, lets get to some things that I did like about this movie and one of those is the set designs. The scale and detail of some of the sets did well to set the mood. Also, Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are absolutely delightful in this movie. I felt like they were the only actors who had any energy. <br/><br/>The main reason why I did not like this movie is that I do not think Hugh Jackman can sing. Every time he came on I would start to cringe. The rest of cast were just there. I did not care about their story line."
"greekstreek-1","4","10","25","27 December 2012"," Poorly Directed
","I love Les Mis, both the book and the musical. I found Liam Neeson's ValJean and Geoffrey Rush's Javert compelling and very well acted. But I did not like this movie.<br/><br/>There were two main problems. 1) Russel Crowe as Javert and 2) Tom Hooper's directing. The former is clear, his voice was distractingly bad and made me look forward to the end of his solos, which should be among the most powerful and moving in the story. Enough said - he was bad, but I expected this going in and was prepared to look past it.<br/><br/>The part that I was most disappointed by was Tom Hooper's directing. For all his much lauded ""live singing"" method he didn't use it properly in the film at all, to the movie's great detriment. The place where the benefit of live singing was most clearly seen was in the introduction. In ""look down"" we have a dynamic scene where the character's breathlessness ties into the song and makes the whole performance wonderful and believable. Unfortunately, from there it felt flat.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie consisted of EXTREMELY long close ups of the soloist while they stood absolutely still. Watching an unmoving close up of Fantine's face for 5 full minutes while she sings her Opus may be an artistic choice, but he does it in EVERY DAMN SCENE. I'm not sure if this is born from the desire to directly transpose the musical to the screen (a mistake) or a necessity due to live singing restricting the actor's movements and the dynamism of the scene. Either way it ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>There was so much wasted opportunity for character development and visual intrigue that was not realized due to poor directing. In ""empty chairs"", show us some scenes of Marius's friends, show us more of the aftermath, for God's sake do SOMETHING other than a 5-minute long close up of his face while he sings. This is a MOVIE, you have an opportunity here to bring more than the musical can achieve. Instead what we saw was more like a PBS special live-stage filming of a cast that was only adequate at singing the songs. Maybe it would have worked better if the A list stars had all been virtuoso singers, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>The only bright spot was Anne Hathaway. I checked my watch for the first time less than an hour in. Tom Hooper wasted an opportunity here with no scenery, no dynamism, no development...a disappointment. Next time let's let someone have a crack at this that understands film as a visual medium."

I find this movie a way to be musically dramatic in an exaggerated way and pass its way through success by showing the good drama in a musical way to please drama societies and teachers. I wont recommend this movie as lines of crowds left the cinema . I'm honest and have nothing to win or lose if i lied. The singers where not very musically trained . I was thinking Susan Boyle all the way . The movie in the other hand had amazing directed pictures and sound effects , and that was the best thing about the movie. The movie would be worst if the director made this movie during the 60's . because the pictures were bad those days and would make this movie an extreme failure."
"BlairMcLovin","5","9","22","23 December 2012"," Les Misérables Review
","I don't enjoy musical theatre.<br/><br/>That being said I found Les Mis to be quite engaging from a technical standpoint. Between Tom Hooper's lively camera-work and the choice to have the actor's singing live on set, the musical becomes more dynamic which is the major advantage a film adaptation has over the stage. Where I take issue with the film is that it's shot as though it were a gritty, small-scale drama, which just feels aesthetically awkward when being used for these grandiose musical sequences and large scale ""emoting"".<br/><br/>Another problem I found is it feels restrained to the vision of the musical and much of what is taking place on camera isn't appropriate to the medium. By this I mean instances where instead of having a character act out what they are feeling, they instead sing it, which makes sense on the stage but is unnecessary with film where you have full view of a characters face. <br/><br/>Also, Russell Crowe seemed to be struggling quite a bit with the high notes and the production designer went a bit overboard in the sewer escape sequence, by putting so much poo on screen at one time even I had to stop and observe ""that's a bit too much poo"".<br/><br/>So as much as I liked the technical aspects I didn't really enjoy the story the film was telling and found its balance between realism and a heightened sense of reality off-putting. Although there were a bunch of 15-year-old kids crying during the emotional scenes at my screening, so maybe it was really good and I'm wrong, you decide!"

This Les Miserables movie version is full of Hollywood ""A"" listers who couldn't carry a tune in a sack. Horribly miscast the cast directors should have picked singers who could pass as actors rather than actors who tried and failed miserably to pass as singers. For those who haven't seen the play it is a very powerful and moving epic. Please don't judge the stage production by this unmitigated disaster. What went on here is taking a well known brand and slapping it on claptrap that Hollywood investors do from time to time to squeeze profits out of. The failure here is too much investor money chasing a well known brand with a movie vehicle that should have never left the editing room. I still can't believe I actually sat through this torture.

"rachelschacter","4","6","13","20 January 2013"," Les Disappointment
","I'm in that category of people who desperately wanted to love the film adaptation of Les Mis. Sadly no matter how hard I tried to, I couldn't deny that thirty minutes into the film, I wanted to get up and leave and never look back. No one can deny that Les Mis is an emotional roller-coaster ride projecting us into scenes of tragedy and despair, climbing up to some comic relief from The Thenardiers and then loop-the-looping round into a gushy love story and once again into war. The story is supposed to fill your senses to bursting and I walked into the cinema fully expecting to ball my eyes out having done so during the theatre performance. But I left with a full packet of tissues and a bitter look of disappointment on my face. However, before I start my criticism, it must be said that the actors were the saving grace. I admired the use of live singing; it truly showed off the talent on display. <br/><br/>Tom Hooper may have won Academy Awards for 'The Kings Speech' but I could not see any of the talented director's work within the first half of this film. I sat, straining to get a good look at the beautifully designed sets and costumes (that must have cost a fortune) but found myself unable to do so because all Hooper wanted to show the audience was close-up after close-up after close-up. It felt like there was a complete lack of creativity when shooting each song. And when Hooper did steer away from faces, there were so many shots within a few seconds that it was incredibly difficult to figure out what I was seeing at all! Even the use of lighting took away an emotional connection for me. <br/><br/>The next thing that started to bother me was the lack of time before each song. It could be that I (like so many other theatre goers) am used to some time to applaud and soak in the music, but it seemed that another song was starting before the previous one had barely finished.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were outstanding. However, I must admit that I didn't enjoy the placing or performance of 'Bring Him Home'. It didn't have the peaceful, almost lullaby-like feeling that it should have had and poor Anne Hathaway's exceptional performance was butchered by the use of direction. I couldn't muster up a single tear for her story, however much I wanted to. <br/><br/>I've heard mixed reviews on Russell Crowe's performance. I personally think it was a little half hearted. Yes, he can sing and he performed his songs technically correct; but I felt no passion or empathy for his character and his state of mind during either of Javert's main songs. 'Stars' is supposed to be a prayer to God but it felt more like a practice in the shower! His suicide song was somewhat better but it still lacked...something more. However, that being said he at least looked the part. <br/><br/>Helena Bonham-Carter is a brilliant actress. She knows how to make the audience laugh and has one of those faces that just screams 'mad woman'. But for me, she just wasn't Madame Thenardier, I only saw Helena Bonham-Carter. When she sings, she rarely uses much facial expression or vocal emphasis which let her down greatly during 'Master of The House'. <br/><br/>The second half of the film started to ease up a bit on the excessive close-ups, presumably because the sets were larger and there were more characters to fit into each shot. That helped me to get into the feel of it slightly more. But certain songs that deserved to really shine were just pushed into the shadows. 'On My Own' and 'A Little Fall of Rain' seemed pointless to include at all because Eponine's love for Marius felt so rushed throughout each scene. Then there was the exclusion (more or less) of the brilliant song 'Little People' which meant that Gavroche's feisty attitude wasn't allowed to be shown properly. Because of this, I felt very little when he died. <br/><br/>The ending was probably the best part for me (and I don't mean that sarcastically.) A Finale has to be strong and Hooper provided one (but perhaps still a little rushed and simplistic.) <br/><br/>Lastly, when someone enjoys a musical score as much as I do Les Mis, the last thing you want to hear is the changing of any words. Particularly when it seems utterly unnecessary! Hooper's version of the production does this one too many times for my liking. <br/><br/>All in all, I found the whole thing underwhelming. It seemed to focus too much on all the wrong things, and in doing so didn't move me whatsoever. In future, I will stick to the theatre."
"scflanagan","3","6","13","31 December 2012"," Dull, gray, and disappointing
","Let me start off by saying that all of the actors gave amazing performances. And the movie itself WAS quite pretty in a weird one-color pallet sort of way. But I went into the movie without any knowledge of the plot, and only knew it was a musical with many good actors. Thus, to my dismay, I found that the story felt disjointed, the characters were shallow and the plot as a whole was so damned predictable I wanted to, just once, be slightly surprised. What I don't understand is why I'm supposed to feel any sorrow for these people. I get that they're poverty stricken, but am I really supposed to care about any of the rebels? They set up crap defenses on ONE block of a huge city (and yes I know other barricades existed but if they were anything like the one centered on the movie, it makes no difference) and expect to inspire the masses to take arms against an uncaring, ridiculously huge force? Honestly it was hysterical when the little cockney (which is another complaint I'll get to in a bit) bugger gets dropped, and the audience is supposed to be hurt and SURPRISED? It is literally the oldest most predictable ""tear-jerker"" in the book. Come on people. Accents also were a little bit strange... Everyone for the most part had British accents, including the thickest cockney I've ever heard. Isn't this France? And it was stranger because some did in fact have French accents! It all seemed a bit lazy. Finally, the plot itself was just a mess, jumping ahead multiple times during climax scenes that could (should) have been the end of the movie. It just kept going, song after boring song. And the ending was the weirdest bit in the whole movie. Basically, after ALL the rebels and uninteresting characters have died, we are given a final farewell shot of them holding their own little revolution. It's really quite depressing and strange because it confirms that the rebels lost, that nothing has changed, that everyone ""good"" has died. How is any of this a good ending?! So Jackman gets to go live with all of these dead people in heaven now, and everyone else lives in the same poverty stricken conditions they already were? It just leaves an even more sour taste in my mouth. It sends the resounding theme that this movie is not about revolutions at all but that a revolution happens to be a backdrop to a boring relationship between two characters that will be fine no matter how bad conditions get because the boy in question is still rich. I like musicals! I really do! But these songs are dull, repetitive, and downright frustrating when the same refrain is repeated about thirty times in an even duller, supposedly ""emotional"" manner of slowness that seemingly can't be avoided. Not every song needed to be given to the actors to do their own tempo! It slows the movie by about thirty minutes when Jackman repeatedly stops to stare pensively into the distance. I think this story would work quite well if it just stayed as a Broadway musical, but on the big screen with no intermissions it is dull, repetitive, predictable, depressing, and ridiculously drawn out. Simply put, avoid this movie if you are actually looking for entertainment."
"toppdogge","10","6","13","28 December 2012"," The best movie I have ever seen....no...really!
","I am no professional movie reviewer, and have never written one of these before now. After seeing this movie, I just had to say something. I have heard the soundtrack for Les Mis, a million times, but have never seen a production of it before, except some clips on you tube. The advertising for this movie was very well done, as I could not wait to see this movie after seeing the preview the first time. This movie is just beautiful to watch. The sets, the cast, the music, all of it is a thing of beauty. I have seen several shows on Broadway, and it is a lot like watching it on stage. We all knew Hathaway and Jackman were going to be fantastic, but there are a few new comer stand outs to watch out for. Samantha Barks played Eponine in the West End production of Les Mis, and beat out Lea Michele and Taylor Swift in the movie version. Her voice is phenomenal. Her ability to display such wide varieties of emotion, all while singing a song, will make you fall in love. Daniel Huttlestone, plays Gavroche, a 10 year old street urchin, who joins the Revolution. This kids is such a wonderful little actor. He is one of those kids who just instantly draws you in. Not to mention, this kid has the sweetest little voice! You can tell he has a background in musical theatre. Though I do love musicals, I am not normally a fan of true musicals, where all of the dialog is singing. This movie has been the only exception for me, of that example, that I even liked. I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD!"
"DarthPaul85","7","6","13","27 December 2012"," Good- but a little disappointing to a fan of the original.
","I think I was less impressed with this movie than most people, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's just...different.<br/><br/>This movie chose to go with an ""acting first"" approach to the songs, meaning that they were sung on set, and the actors had the freedom to express the lyrics however they wanted, and how you feel about this decision will greatly affect how much you enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I think it was a neat idea, but hinders the enjoyment of the music and pokes holes in an otherwise tight musical score.<br/><br/>This musical was written to be a stage show, and the songs written to be sung as if they are songs- not acting soliloquy. To miss melodies that belong in the song because the actor ""went a different direction with it"" felt like a bad trade. Most notably, Valjean's songs have a sort of rambling, unprovoked nature to them- and in many cases the ""acting"" style of performing them feels awkward or forced.<br/><br/>What the director didn't quite count on, is that people don't naturally sing their feelings in real life. So trying to make a show ""more realistic"" by making the songs seem more extemporaneous doesn't work- it just makes the *songs* feel less structured, but it doesn't make the fact that they *are singing* more believable.<br/><br/>It's still a cool idea, and it might have worked...for a different show. This musical doesn't give the actors motivation to sing rather than speak because it doesn't need to; it's always singing; that's the suspension of disbelief that we make going to see this show. <br/><br/>The movie tries to add that motivation, and then gambles that it can do so if it makes the songs less ""song-like""- sort of like each song builds from emotional talking to full-blown signing. Some songs lend themselves well to this, but the musical already exploited that device for those songs. Forcing it to others just feels...well, forced.<br/><br/>Another gripe I have is how they changed the words of many lines. A couple lines might be easier to understand now, but many of them feel overly simplified or dumbed-down. What also hurts here is that often the new words are less lyrical than the original- the words just sound wrong, or too casual.<br/><br/>My last complaint is how they changed the musical score of the prose. Les mis is a musical that re-uses melodies a lot as is, but they take it even further in the movie. We become a bit over-saturated with some of the musicals best melodies- which is too bad.<br/><br/>All that said, many of the best songs are faithfully recreated her on screen. Anne Hathaway is perfect (and I say that as someone who is not a fan of Anne Hathaway). All the women are wonderful, Enjoras is also wonderful, as are the supporting actors. Jackman and Crowe are great actors, and it shows. They both know how to sing, and that shows, but I miss the voices I'm used to for songs like Who Am I and Stars.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I was disappointed because I wanted what I already had- the musical. The movie will definitely appeal to musical fans, though, and perhaps newcomers or people who are ready for something different will enjoy it more than I did. Just be warned- you are not getting the Broadway musical here- you're getting a ""hollywood gritty"" version of it."
"fenriswoolf","3","8","19","10 January 2013"," When Music Kills
","Leave it to a Frenchman to write a novel about the rabble, and to Hollywood to make a boulevard operetta out of it, and the result will be a cinematic disaster. We live in a time, which is already painfully devoid of nobility, so for Hollywood making vulgarity heroic is a sign of a lack of imagination that we find so often in movies produced for the big screen. Les Miserables is plagued by schizophrenia, a split personality of exceptional photography and miserable musical scores. The main conflict of the story is drowned in poorly performed arias. I like Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman as actors, but it became clear rather quickly: they're NOT opera singers. The music was composed too much soprano, too much tenor, that even Helena Bonham-Carter, whose superb performance in Sweeny Todd was still fresh in memory, had issues keeping tune. In any case: making Les Miserables an operetta was a great disservice to the plot that even the great photography could not remedy. The picturesque tone was held in dark colours, the CGI was integrated flawlessly and the photographer captured the emotions the actors portrayed splendidly. But the infamous power of the music could not be undone. The movie made my eyes water, my ears suffer and my brain utterly confused about what the heck Hollywood is thinking these days."
"greyhairmonster","3","8","19","26 December 2012"," Visually stunning, musically appalling
","I would say to anyone who loves the musical to give the film a wide berth, whilst the director has gone all out in reproducing the period and characters it is obvious from the start that the two leading male actors cannot sing to save their lives. Had the producers taken the route of making it a drama rather than a musical then it would have worked well but they didn't and never have two roles been so miscast. I don't know what the director was thinking when Jackman & Crowe were awarded the roles but they have the singing ability of a brick, actually that would be doing the brick an injustice. <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway surprised me with her vocal range and both Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter gave good portrayals of the inn keeper and wife respectfully, but combined with the efforts of the remaining cast they could not make up for the disappointing renditions by Crowe & Jackman. I rated it 3 starts purely for the visual effort, had it been based solely on the musical effort ....well...there are no ""Minus"" starts available."
"shaun_sat","2","7","16","31 December 2012"," SInging at every chance is not always a good thing
","At the start of the movie , everything seems great, there's a great song with Hugh Jackman. Then realize everyone has conversations in a tune. Its not even called singing, they just added a lousy tune to their words. Though, this is the only flaw in the movie. The cast is simply superb with Jackman giving his best along Hathaway. The plot and story is also wonderful about the amount suffering a man has to go through just because he stole a loaf of bread. But unfortunately,this is not enough and like a small virus, this destroys the movie. How can this be?

"luciaherran","10","3","5","9 April 2017"," The Miserables, a film to dream
","Okay... the first time i saw ""Les Miserables"" i didn't like it so much... well, i'm going to be honest i hate it. I was eight years old i think, and my father told me that i have to see it, and that was all. But then i saw it again, the last year and i thought it was really good. The characterization was excellent and all the set and the special effects was fascinating. The film is partitioned by three parts, so i'm going to go part by part. Te first part is about Jean ValJean, who is a prisoner in the old France, and the policeman, whose name is Javert. Javert give the conditional to ValJean, who's going to be constrained by those papers all his life. He know that he can't be free at all with those papers so he decided to broke them and start a new life. Personally i find this part a little bit boring, but i think is necessary to understand the rest of the history so it's okay. In the second part ValJean starts his life as mayor of the town. He is totally different but soon Javert discover that he's the prisoner ho broke his parole, so he starts to seek ValJean to see him again at prison. At the same time ValJean starts to meet more characters of the film, like Fantine, or her daughter Cosette. This part is more interesting than the last, cause you know more characters and the history start to have sense. And in the third part, you know the rest of the characters like Enjorlas, the lead of the revolutionaries; Marius, who's in love with Cosette; Eponine, who's smitten of Marius, or Gavroche, who is a boy who goes to the barricades with the revolutionaries being like an adult boy. In this part you are totally enmeshed in the film and yo feel like you are in the barricades with all this people fighting for the freedom. In conclusion I think this film is full of emotions and all the type of feelings: sadness, happiness, euphoria... and i thin that all the people who like to laugh, or the love, the tragedy or the belligerent conflicts have to see this film. It was simply perfect."

","Two stars, because it could have been worse, they might have cast Taylor Swift.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman doesn't suck. Pretty much everything else does.<br/><br/>This film is horrible. Anyone who loves this must be on drugs. The costumes, sets, and cheesy staging are all awful. The pacing is off, this 'might' be the speed the music is written at for a stage show, although I seriously doubt it, the same mistake is often made in Shakespeare productions where everything is embued with Far! Too! Much! Importance! If! One! Asked! For! Directions! To! The! Corner! Store! It! Shouldn't! Take! This! Long! To! Get! Directions!<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway should be forced to return her Oscar and to publicly apologize for this awful performance. She is overacting like crazy. I agree with all the critics who said that if an actress is crying during her song then the audience is generally dry-eyed. For all her starving herself to the point that apparently when anyone hugged her they would ""cry"" because she was so ""frail"" she looks actually quite healthy with a positively anachronistic bosom, and much better makeup than anyone else in the factory, and she would have more money to send to her daughter if she didn't spend it on pretty pink dresses when everyone else wears drab blue/grey. Of course when she goes through her drastic decline I would really like to know how much money she got for her dress sleeves.<br/><br/>It's bad when a film makes you think of other films in disfavourable ways. I thought of ""Forrest Gump"", ""Soylent Green"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" before much time had past, and none of those were nice comparisons. I also once heard a 1930s ""Threepenny Opera"" starring Marlene Deitrich and Lotte Lenya, which I expected to be amazing, only to find it was a sort of sheepish trilling that set my fillings off, much like Amanda Seyfried's warblings. Not long after that though was the incongruity of noticing Eponine's manicured fingernails during her big solo. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe of course is hysterical. In all the wrong ways. Thanks for the laughs, Russell, I needed that.<br/><br/>Poor Hugh Jackman, he deserves better. The director, Anne Hathaway and Russell Crowe should spend a few hours in the stocks. Actually please leave the director in there for a week, along with Chris Columbus, whose work he appears to look up to. (shudder)"

Employee Fantine is fired, and is forced into prostitution, to keep herself and new daughter alive.

","There's plenty to enjoy in the latest movie version of the musical Les Misérables about a group of beautifully sad and tragic people. But ultimately it leaves me feeling disappointed and not as gaga over the performance of Anne Hathaway or the songs as some of my fellow musical lovers. I feel that the movie could have been so much better. <br/><br/>I have heard people complaining about the movie being too long. But I thought the movie was a bit rushed. The musical production is 3 hour-long and it was perfect. The movie introduces and cramps many characters and story lines together and drags on the scenes of the revolution and the battles. My friend, B, said the second half is too long and boring. A lot of the scenes transitions are very abrupt and sudden. The change of tone really hurts the flow of the story and makes me really hard to get into the drama. <br/><br/>The relationships between the characters are underdeveloped. I did not feel the strong emotional bond between Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). This may be why I was not moved when Jean Valjean died in the end. Some characters are also significantly marginalized. There is very little interaction between the characters to make me feel their feelings for each other. Each musical number seems to appear too close to the one before, and there's no room for the song to sink in. The songs are sung very over-the-top at times too when a more subdue simple approach would suffice. <br/><br/>There are, of course, plenty of things to appreciate about Les Misérables. The fantastic cast. The breathtaking, albeit fleeting, performance and voice that fly from Anne Hathaway's mouth. The way Jean Valjean sings to a sleeping Cosette in the carriage. The strong performance of Eponine (Samantha Barks) singing ""On my own"", the way all the characters try to maintain a sense of honor and principle in a world, except for the Thenardier couple (even the Thenardiers are very likable). The amazing set, scenery and costumes are really more appealing on a big screen than onstage. For most of us, I can see that the movie would be a fine and powerful entertaining adaptation.<br/><br/>But as a fan of the musical? I can't make myself care about what drives the characters in this movie version. When I read reviews by people who really, really love the movie, I feel like an ultimate outsider. It's so gorgeous! I cried! I wanted to clap after every song! The costume! And if you do, good for you! You are probably capable of a more sophisticated attitude toward this Les Misérables than I can manage. I, on the other hand, miss the impact of each songs sung by the live actors and the sense of the French revolutionary period captured by the stage production. <br/><br/>I do think it is a must-see for the musical lovers. The movie itself is a great effort that has its moments but never fully connect to the beauty of the musical."

","Les Miserables is the film adaptation of the Broadway Musical version of Victor Hugo's novel. It seems a real challenge to bring it on cinematic screen. The result is it's rich in production and magnificent by the performances, but the direction serves a shaky storytelling and some messy editing. Some mistakes can be forgiven but much affected goes to the direction. Well most people came here for the songs and the singing but it could have been much better if the film consistently deliver its story. It may have the looks of a grand overwhelming show but when you see beneath it, you'll realize it's a cinematic gloss. A really beautiful cinematic gloss.<br/><br/>In general opinion, it's all about the performances. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway both genuinely carries the emotion and the pain of their characters. Russell Crowe gets a fascinating turn on his performance by singing. Aside the performances is how the film plays. Most of the film are closer shots of the actors singing out their emotions. It sounds like an interesting style for a musical as you contemplate on how they are performing but that is it. It's just a bunch of people singing in grueling two hours.<br/><br/>It still follows the story but the way it is told is underwhelming compared to its magnificent performances. There is actually little care to its storytelling. They just throw away some details and then they let a character sing. It seems to rely too much on what it looks like. But they sure are beautiful. The staging and production values look excellent. The intro is so magnificent, it's easily one of the most amazing looking parts of the film. The actors also made the song there a lot more catchy. More spectacular sets are the French Revolution and the Barricade that keeps the scale so large. The shaky cam is a strange choice for this. The use ends up unfitting.<br/><br/>The actors keeps it powerful and they are indeed natural. I'll say Les Miserables is one of the grandest and most beautiful looking films of the year, but looking inside it, it seems artificial and contrived. It's disappointing because there could have been some interesting style to the storytelling. They instead give endless closeup shots of the singers to tell the story but here it doesn't work. It's still pretty enjoyable if you are in for the songs that you've already heard in the theater show. Les Miserables is a dazzling film with remarkable performances but it doesn't make enough difference to the original musical."

The story of an ex-convict (Hugh Jackman in a powerful performance) trying to escape his past by breaking parole, but with an obsessed lawman (Russell Crowe, menacing, but excellent performance)on his trail to capture him. To round out the spectacular cast is the performance of Anne Hathaway as the unfortunate Fantaine, who dreamed of a better life but was stolen from her. The rest of the cast includes Amanda Seyfried as Fantaine's daughter, Cosette who is raised by Jackman after her mother's death, Eddie Redmayne as young student Marius who falls in love with Cosette and new-comer Samantha Barks as the faithful, loyal Eponine. <br/><br/>The singing is beyond compare of any musical film of the decade. Hathaway's tearful rendition of the famous 'I Dreamed a Dream' is so heart-breaking as we watch her descend into her private hell. Barks's performance of the sorrowful ballad 'On My Own' rivals any past performance as she walks down the rainy streets of Paris on the eve of the student revolution. The greatest addition to this list of classic is the recently Oscar-nominated 'Suddenly' written for Hugh Jackman by the musical's original composer. Jackman's beautiful tenor voice sings this song to the young Cosette (Isabelle Allen as a child) as he takes her away to safety, promising he will always protect her. <br/><br/>If you have not yet seen this masterpiece, then to arms and go forth."

","""Les Mis"" was anything but miserable! From the opening note to the credit line the Acting was an impeccably forceful, gritty, masterpiece. Not that screen actors would present, or even mostly possess, the illustrious vocal prowess of many, many famed stage performances of this; however, the raw, emotional, realness of these vocal performances propelled the characters to highest rarely seen in any venue. The only peculiar vocal performance, obviously, was that of Russell Crowe, who gave the biggest risk to his celebrity and popularity. In my opinion, however, he will have grown tremendously in his further acting for the enormous amount of emotional fortitude this role required, and also to have had to sing directly into Hugh's face most of the time. The endeavor will outweigh the performance. Hugh...Hugh, Hugh, Hugh. What rare, magnanimous, awe you have inspired. This is your moment that will pale the rest of your career. The scarcity of this level of perfection is extreme, and you have achieved such. This is what the purity of entertainment and acting is about. Anne, your multitudes continue to change and amaze viewer's imaginations. A short but powerful statement. Amanda Seyfried provided a needed sweetness and charm and Eddie Redmayne showed both his vocal power and deep emotional nuance. Samantha Barks performance was particularly moving also. New fav duo SBC and HBC tickled the dark and sarcastic, comical child in those of us that always love them for it, as they commonly do. This film can be summarized by three main points: a beautiful artistic vision, viciously bold directing, and irreligiously brilliant acting. Not a must see, but a must experience film."
"dimichino83","8","3","5","15 January 2013"," Les Miserables review from a big fan in London
","The transition from stage to screen is never an easy one for any musical let alone one which is not simply a musical but a modern opera that continues to delight audiences all over the world. Tom Hooper faced this challenge head on and in a risky move, stuck to the show's sung through format and only rarely do the actors employ spoken dialogue. Is there a place for the sung through musical on the big screen? If It is done properly, then yes and that is what makes the movie of Les Miserables a milestone, not the live singing. Much has been said of Anne Hathaway's take on the consumptive prostitute, Fantine, and her version of I dreamed a dream stands out not only because the actress plays the part so well but also because the orchestrations have been stripped to what at times, makes the song sound like a chamber piece but it works so well and you will be forgiven for shedding a few tears. Hugh Jackman delivers a captivating performance as Jean Valjean and the young leads of Cosette, Eponine and Marius are beautifully interpreted by Amanda Seyfried, Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne, whose Empty chairs at empty tables will no doubt leave some of you reaching for your hankies again. Yet another stand out performance comes from Aaron Tveit as Enjolras who leads a highly competent set of 'Barricade boys'. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were fittingly cast as the Thenardiers and I laughed during their scenes. The role of Gavroche has been expanded slightly and offers a chance to pay homage to Oliver. That now leaves us with Russell Crowe who appears to be going somewhere with his take on Javert though a sense of frustration over never catching Valjean, is something that could have been worked on and without giving too much away, one might want a bit more anguish leading up to that certain climactic moment. I will however give him credit for giving what I think is a nice rendition of Stars and the confrontation scene is done really well. Voice wise, he's not brilliant but far from awful. On the technical side of things, the IMAX experience of Les Miserables is fantastic and the sound engineers did a superb job of mixing the live vocals with the orchestra in post- production. For those of you who are as nerdy as me, the orchestrations are mainly new, intimate at times and big when necessary. At points they sound more like the ones used for the 25th anniversary concert, in particular during One day more. The synthesisers, bass and electric guitars as well as the drum kit are nowhere to be heard. The costumes are realistic and come across nicely on screen and the CGI added a certain dreamlike quality, taking in the best of what Moulin Rouge and Sweeney Todd had to offer though don't always expect a still camera but do expect some nice vistas. There were moments where I thought a song was edited too much and therefore rushing the narrative a bit and with the film running at more than two and a half hours, a few more minutes wouldn't have killed anyone. We shall see if there will be an extended blu-ray edition. All in all this is a film which I highly recommend and while it is not perfect, the good outshines the bad and most importantly, it touches you as much as the stage production. For all the fans out there, the parts that made you cry in the theatre will make you cry in the cinema and for the uninitiated, you will see why Les Miserables has become the success it is and you will certainly connect with at least one of those iconic characters. I give this film 8/10 Well done Tom Hooper and cast!"

","After finishing for the second time, my feeling is like being marooned in the nineteenth century-France by the elegance of Les Miserables. English Literature student, Tom Hooper made an accomplishing task to choose and direct the eminent novel Les Miserables. He perfectly transformed the story into the musical narratives with bravery. Two Aussies, Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe were as always splendid in their roles---protagonist Jean Valjean and antagonist Javert. Especially as Hugh's magnitude of acting was too grand; it must be the 2nd mightiest leading characters in 2012 after Daniel Day Lewis. Anna Hathaway, in her little but the most catchy-tragic appearance, won all hearts and emotions and would win surely the Oscar in best supporting female role too :p Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also glowed to render comical relief brilliantly :p Amanda Seyfried and Eddie were just pitch- okay with their performances. The cinematography, OSTz, costumes, society of that period, French Revolution setting----all came as well- crafted. In my notion, if Oscar were not biased with the American sentiments around ""Lincoln"", Les Miserables would score Oscar as the ace-flick :p"

","Absolute priority - take a very big hankie. This screen version captures an intensity of emotion that I feel is impossible with the stage version, simply because you feel you are there, sharing all the experiences, which you cannot do seated in a theatre. Anne Hathaway's rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' is breathtaking and heartbreaking in its emotion as is Eddie Redmayne's of 'Empty Chairs'. There were two elements that for me did not work: the 'Master of the House' scene was not as raucous and rumbustious as seen on stage (twice)-it involved too many customers and therefore the interplay between 'Master' & Mistress'did not come across as effectively, plus I was not taken with Amanda Seyfried's singing voice - reminded me of the type of voice one would hear in a 30's/40's musical film. Although Russell Crowe's voice was not as strong as some may have liked, for me it reflected a character that was damaged and vulnerable and it worked. And for those wondering if Hugh Jackman could make 'Bring Him Home' work - a resounding Yes ! I left the cinema feeling that I had fought on the barricades, suffered alongside a brave man (Jean Valjean), cried over the unrequited love of Eponine, had a flickering of compassion for Javert and all to the background of wonderful overpowering music. And you wonder why I recommended a big hankie !"

","Les Miserables: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Entertaining, Artistic, Melodious, Brillianted Acted by the ensemble cast and Perfectly presented by the talented Tom Hooper, Les Miserables is almost like a breath of fresh air to movies of the past and is a real entertaining and artistic ride from the start to the end, and is aided by the amazing acting from the front trio(Jackman, Crowe and Hatthaway) and the rest of the cast and the brilliant presentation by Tom Hooper who has made one of the finest Musicals of the past years.<br/><br/>The Story which is based on the book written by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, is during the 1800's in France where a prisoner Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman) is given his freedom after many years of prison, but with a note of shame because of which he can never get any recognition. But after getting inspired by An Old Man after he stayed at his house for a night, he decides to become a better person and after some years He becomes the Mayor of a town and now runs a factory and lives a good life, but his old tormentor or the guard of the prison he was in Javert( Russel Crowe) is back to reveal his identity and take him back to prison, but Jean decides to take the girl of the deceased and dying Fatine( Anne Hatthaway) and fulfill her wishes of keeping her daughter safe and he must run from Javert and give Cosette a good life to live.<br/><br/>The Acting by the whole cast in the movie was absolutely as good as it gets, and every single actor in the scene's have done their role's superbly and have done brilliantly with their lyrics too. But Hugh Jackman steals the show as the lead character Jean Valjean who is running a life of running away and keeping his daughter and himself from harm and Jackman does amazingly in this performance and makes the role his own, his acting and lyrics delivery is quite perfect and this is one of his best performances ever and he proves that he can do lead roles by himself. Anne Hatthaway does'nt have much screen time in the movie, but whatever she has done, she's done to utmost brilliance as the desperate mother Fatine who can do anything to save her daughter from harm, and the role is perfect for her and she does perfectly too. Russel Crowe too did a great job as the ruthless Javert and his lyrics delivery is superb. Sacha Boren Cohen and Helena Botham Carter give an comedical taste to the movie with their hilarious performance as the sly couple who had Cosette, and Amanda Seyfield and Eddie Redmayne too have done their jobs well.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper was quite bold in making this type of a movie, as this is his 4th movie ever but he is such a talented director that he has made a superb musical movie and one of the best of the past years, he had chosen and handled his multi-talented cast perfectly and he has synchronised all the lyrics of the movie brilliantly with the visuals as well as the music, and all the aspects of the scenes were terrificly well made and he continues to keep on making great films and entertaining one's too and considering the amount of work he had to put in with such a huge staff, he really did a great work to make this movie. <br/><br/>The Story of the movie based on a book is quite brilliant and all the years shown in the life of Jean where he travels through different places are written superbly, and it is adapted brilliantly by Screen- Play Writer William Nicholson and the lyrics of the movie are so brilliantly written as well by Herbert Kretzmer and they are greatly fitted for a musical movie and all the aspects of the story are synchronised superbly in the film. The Cinematography of the Movie is also quite great as the places of the pre-war France is shown superbly and some of the scenes are quite spectacular and the Cinematographer Danny Cohen really did a great job.<br/><br/>The Music in these type of Musical-movies are obviously the backbone of the movie and the music director Claude-Michel Schönberg did not disappoint here, as he did a terrific job in synchronising the music perfectly with all the lyrics in the movie and the different type of classical music used by him in the movie can be a music-lover's delight. The Art Direction team needs to get its applause too for its superb effort with the art direction of the film and the 1800's France is so brilliantly shown in the movie. The Costume Design team too needs to get applause for its effort with the costumes worn by the actors and the costumes were so realistic and added to the brilliance of the film.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie is one of the best musical movies i've ever watched and one of 2012's finest movies which can be enjoyed by all sets of audience and this can be a real Awards favourite this time."
"christian_mcdonald","9","3","5","13 January 2013"," Le mis review
","Le miserables is a musical from the academy award winning director Tom Hooper who is well known for his work in the 2010 film ""the kings speech"". Hooper is back again and is stepping out of his comfort zone a little bit with a musical, not just any musical but the very popular musical ,Le miserables and not only did he chose a musical with very little straight talking and most of the movie being sung, but all the singing was filmed along with the scene in real time witch makes for a slightly less polished singing performance but if you know Le mis its anything but polished.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays the lead character Jean val jean who is a convict that was convicted for stealing a loaf of bread for his sisters starving child and was forced to spend 20 years in incarceration. once he was let free he was put on parole but he had ran away and failed to report to his parole and started a new life. the story revolves around him and the people that he helps and puts his life on the line for all while being chased by military officer Je vert played by Kurt Russel. the cast also includes Anne Hathaway and Amanda Sifried.<br/><br/>first of all I'm just going to say this movie is not for everyone.this movie is more like a play happening in front of your eyes in movie form. its a very long movie but i think if it was any shorter it wouldn't really connect with all the points that would make this a full story. with this movie being based off a play it has no real middle, movies usually have three acts and Le mis is based of a play and they have two acts so its a little hard sometimes to figure out where you are in the movie. but the music is very good and you find songs that you herd earlier in the movie coming back is some of the dialogue melody's. the singing really went hand in hand with the acting and although some where better than others overall the acting and singing really carried the movie and kept me interested.<br/><br/>overall i think the movie was very good. it will definitely be a Oscar contender and without a doubt take home some awards. although this movie is not for everybody i think if you go in with a open mind and just see the movie for what it is you will probably come out with a smile on your face."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","3","5","11 January 2013"," Both flawed and beautiful like the musical, the film adaptation of Les Mis is every bit as good as can be hoped for.
","27 years ago, Les Miserables began running performances in London and Broadway to significant acclaim and massive staying power. Written by Claude Michel-Schonberg, Alain Boublil, and Herbert Kretzmer, and based on Victor Hugo's classic novel, it is often considered to be the greatest musical of all time. You can see why adapting it to the screen would be a challenge of unheard expectations, and director Tom Hooper was who would eventually lead it there. In many ways, it's considerably different from the stage show itself, but is it for worse or for better?<br/><br/>Les Miserables chronicles the life of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a man released on parole after nineteen years of imprisonment. After being taken in by a kindly priest, and treated with kindness that he'd never known before, he vows to change his ways by creating an honest life for himself. He has not gone by the name of Valjean for eight years. This does not go unnoticed, as he is relentlessly pursued by his former warden, Javert (Russell Crowe). It isn't until later, after Valjean makes a vow to the dying Fantine (Anne Hathaway), that Javert is on to Valjean, swearing to send him back to prison.<br/><br/>Fantine is the epitome of all the heartbreak that is to follow within Les Miserables. Some would argue that her only massively great moment is her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"", but there's more to it than that. This is such an emotional and moving portrayal, unselfish, and unflinching. She may not be in it for very long, but she leaves a lasting impression, and even if it did all come down to that one scene, so what? That one scene is enough. I thought I knew the song pretty well, but listening to Hathaway sing, I suddenly heard it in a brand new light. All the devastation and the sorrow come out in such a big way that I can't picture the person watching it without being moved. Hathaway's just that good.<br/><br/>After Fantine succumbs to her illness, Valjean fulfills his vow to care for her daughter Cosette, taking her from the custody of the greedy town Innkeepers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). Nine years later, a student rebellion against the oppressive law of Paris is beginning. One of the fighters is Marius (Eddie Redmayne). By chance, Valjean is in town at that time, along with the grown Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). When Marius sees Cosette, it's love at first sight, but what Marius doesn't see is that his friend Eponine (Samantha Barks), is deeply in love with him, and is saddened that Marius does not return those feelings.<br/><br/>For a story with as many complicated subplots as Les Miserables, it's a miracle that this movie turned out to be as coherent as it is. Since the film is a musical, the songs allow the film to get across more information than conventional dialogue. As for the singing, I applaud the decision to go for all live singing. By allowing the actors to perform the songs live for every take, the film adds much more realism to the situation, allowing the actors to focus more on their performance rather than keeping match with pre-recorded music. Unlike the musical, it doesn't necessarily sound ""pretty"". The singing here is much more gritty than what you'd hear out of the Broadway show, and that's what makes the songs so effective to the grim tone.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the talent, I must mention Hugh Jackman, finally given the role that he deserves. Blending his strong physique with his incredible singing voice, he's finally putting all his acting chops front and center, letting emotion pour from this character in a career best performance. Amanda Seyfried is serviceable as Cosette. Eddie Redmayne elevates Marius above the rushed standards of the stage version, and Samantha Barks hits hard in her rendition of ""On My Own"". Cohen and Carter provide much of the riotous comic relief amidst the bleak nature of the rest of the film. Even Colm Wilkinson, who originated the role of Valjean in 1985, gets to make an appearance. As for Russell Crowe, his voice may not be great, but no one's voice here sounds ""pretty"", so that's fine. Pretty monotone, but Javert has always called for a bit of monotone. I won't criticize him for his singing voice, but I will criticize his performance for bordering too close to robotic.<br/><br/>As for Hooper's direction, I think criticism of his direction is blown considerably out of proportion, but none of it is without reason. He chooses some very odd and distracting aesthetic and pacing choices, and the close ups of the actors don't do the fabulous sets and costumes much favors, but I think the close ups do their job wonderfully. He may not have a unique visual voice, but his direction of the actors is strong. By using his close ups, he captures every ache and every passion. Hooper's direction is successful in that one regard.<br/><br/>Les Miserables is about as good a film adaptation of a classic musical as possible. Even if you don't like the movie, you can see that everyone involved were proud of what they were doing, and that they so wanted this to be good. It's flawed, but beautiful, much like the musical it was based on. The musical took so many elements and wove them all together into one of the rare products that deserves to be labeled with the word ""masterpiece"". The movie doesn't quite reach that same level of excellence, but for something so sweeping and beautiful, it's as good a movie as anyone can hope for it to be.<br/><br/>****1/2 / *****"
"zenabraithwaite","8","3","5","11 January 2013"," Very musical
","I don't really like films where the actors behave normally then burst into song. Les Mis is not like this; they sing just about everything. All the actors sing very well, don't get the criticism of Russell Crowe, thought he sang well. For me the stand out actor was Aaron Tveit who i have now found out is a stage musical performer and you can tell-real presence and a super vocal-same for the boy who plays Gavroche -again a stage musical performer. I did think some sections were too short and others a bit long. Anne Hathaways story was a bit rushed i thought especially as she features highly in the trailer. The film on the whole was very good but about 15-20 minutes too long which could have been done with better pacing. Enjoy!!"
"dfetters","10","3","5","6 January 2013"," Who wants to come with me to see it again?
","I realized I got super rambly down below, so quickie review: I loved it, every actor (with the slight exception of Russel Crowe) gave an outstanding performance, and musical theater and movie-musicals are two very different things! <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Les Mis and of musicals in general, so I may be a little biased, but I absolutely loved this movie. Apparently, I'm fairly alone in that sentiment, judging from the reviews below me. I think, however, that the mob of negativity is not coming from the movie being bad, but from a misunderstanding of the difference between how the stage works and how film works.<br/><br/>Many people have said that they've seen the musical on-stage and loved it, but hated this version because ""none of the actors could sing"" or ""Eddie Redmayne didn't look the part"" or ""the story was too confusing"", etc. First off, do your research before you write reviews, guys. Most of the main cast has experience singing, and they were all given extensive vocal training leading up to shooting. The extras were cast, for the most part, from other productions of Les Mis. Everybody in this movie can sing, there's no question. What makes the singing in the movie different from the singing on stage is the, for lack of a better word, intimacy provided by a camera. On-stage, everything is exaggerated. Your voice has to be big, your expressions have to be big, your actions have to be big, everything about you has to be over-the-top in order for the entire audience to see and make sense of what you're doing. For this reason, in the musical theater world there is a much higher value placed on vocal talent rather than on acting ability. If an actor doesn't have the pipes to project to the back of the house, they won't be getting a part. A stage musical gets its power from the incredible vocal abilities of its actors. I can leave a theater saying ""Dang, Lea Salonga has an incredible voice!"" and be impacted by her virtuosity, not the story, and feel great about that. In a film, however, the game changes. You don't have to overdo everything because the camera will pick up even the smallest change in your facial expression. It becomes more about the details, the small things that you couldn't express on a stage because no one past the first row would see it. Hugh Jackman's voice sounds weaker than when you heard it on-stage because it IS weaker. He doesn't have to sing to the guy sitting in the far back corner, 50 yards away; he has to sing to a camera three feet from his face. When we're that close to the action, the focus isn't on his vocal ability, it's on the emotion on his face. In film, it's all about the emotion behind the action. Anne Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is by far my favorite, not because of her outstanding singing (it is outstanding, don't get me wrong), but because it's Fantine singing the song, not Anne Hathaway. The same goes for ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" If he had started crying on-stage, like he did in the movie, no one would've heard (let alone understood) what he was singing. On film, it works, because we're watching from right in front of his face, and we don't have to try to decipher his words. It was Marius singing that song, not Eddie Redmayne. The big songs were filmed close-up and live for a reason; the director was giving the actors freedom to make choices, and they made the right ones. I guess all I'm trying to say is that the movie is not meant to sound exactly like the musical. It should be the characters and their emotions coming through, not the actors and their talent, and it achieves that.<br/><br/>To the person who said the Eddie Redmayne isn't handsome enough to be a leading man: Seriously bro!? Get over yourself! I've lost a little bit of faith in humanity reading that we're still judging other's abilities based on their looks.<br/><br/>Almost the whole movie is sung because that's how it's meant to be; Les Mis is more an opera than a musical, in that sense.<br/><br/>The music is repetitive and unoriginal? You try writing 3 hours worth of music for a full orchestra, then come talk to me.<br/><br/>Also, remember, there is a major difference between something that is bad and something that isn't your taste.<br/><br/>To be honest, I agree a little bit with the people who weren't big fans of Russell Crowe, but for different reasons than they give. He did a good job both acting and singing, but he wasn't the Javert I envisioned. Javert, to me, is more forceful, more articulated in his singing. Crowe didn't deliver that, but he by no means did a bad job.<br/><br/>Other than that, there is nothing to dislike about this movie. Every main actor gave the performance of a lifetime. Hugh Jackman carried it, Anne Hathaway and Eddie Redmayne made me cry with their renditions of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,"" Amanda Seyfried has won back a lot of my respect (you hit those high notes girl!), and Samantha Barks is pretty and she can sing! The ensemble cast is also pretty dang fantastic, especially the kids. I could spend so much time talking about just the actors, but, you know, word limits. Anyways, if you're not a fan of musicals or you don't want to see anything changed from the original, then I guess skip it. Otherwise, watch and enjoy!"
"mcalester66","9","3","5","31 December 2012"," The High and the Low
","Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals, and I found it to be an excellent film. But if you expect it to outdo the stage show, you'd best save your money. Les Miserables - 2012 has its high points and its low. <br/><br/>The High Points Overall, the film was visually stunning, with a great cast, and pretty good voices. Anne Hathaway - Fantine - was very heart-touching, and her renditions of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and her death song ""Come to Me"" were very well sung. Jackman - Valjean - surprised me. I had seen the previews of the film and was not entirely impressed at first with his voice. But in the end, his renditions of ""Bring Him Home"" and ""Who Am I"" stole me. All of the students in the Barricade scenes had very good voices too. The new songs such as ""I Have a Crime to Declare"" and ""Suddenly"" were very nice to hear. Russel Crowe was also very good. His voice - not amazing - but he put energy into it. <br/><br/>The Low Points Master of the House was entirely off. While the entire film is artsy and well done, this scene is low and crude, with many visual gags that take away from the song - including urinating into a tankard and prostitute making love with Saint Nicholas. Sacha Baron Cohen - Thenardier - lacked energy and Helena Bonham Carter - Madam - really did not convince me. She sounded like she did in Kings Speech and Sweeney Todd. At one point, she even looked as though she had no idea what to do with herself. ""Master of the House"" will prompt the use of the skip button on the remote when this film comes out on DVD. I was very glad to see them carried out of the church at the end of the film. Amanda Seyfried (don't know how you spell it) was not a convincing Cosette. Her voice sounded like vibrato in fast forward, and her acting was very dull and ""blah."" She was indeed not ""found"" as she says in ""A Heart Full Of Love."" The makeup was also very over-done, as well as the gags in ""Master of the House."" Every poor person - aside from little Gavroche - had some sort of lump or bump on their face, and the prostitutes looked like something of Tim Burton's films. <br/><br/>A warning to the film-goers. I advise using a restroom before sitting through this 2 1/2 hour film. I had to hold it throughout a good portion of the film. And bring tissues or a handkerchief. The ending is very touching.<br/><br/>However, I thought the film was very inspiring. My family was brought back to the first time that they saw the show on the stage. A work of art nonetheless. I recommend it to everybody."
"ghost_dog86","8","3","5","31 December 2012"," They sing every word!
","First off, I want to do a mini review for all the non-musical fans out there: Musicals aren't for everyone. Furthermore, it is my opinion that ""Les Miserables"", while being the most internationally well regarded musical in history, is also the most inaccessible musical for most novices. So, I cannot in good conscious recommend that anybody, who is not already a fan of musicals, or this particular sweeping and grandiose musical, go see ""Les Miserables"".<br/><br/>With that said, the following is my review for the people who are probably going to see ""Les Miserables"", despite anything that I have to say: Assuming that you are already familiar with the epic identity crisis story of Jean Valjean in 19th-century France, I will be skipping the synopsis rundown all together. ""Les Miserables"" features a star studded cast, the likes of Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, in the role he was born to play and is absolutely superb in, Russell Crowe playing Javert, Valjean's adversary, Anne Hathaway as Fantine, who is also quite excellent here, showing off her exceptional singing voice as she nails ""I Dreamed a Dream"", Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, who add some much needed levity as Thenardier and Madame Thenardier, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, Eddie Redmayne as Marius and Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche, who despite his age, has one of the best singing voices of the lot. OK, it's true that not everybody here can sing, i.e. Seyfried who seems very pitchy and Redmayne, who has one of the weirdest singing voice I've ever heard. But Jackman, who is clearly in his comfort zone and can sing this musical under any condition (even waist deep in feces) and Hathaway and Crowe are so strong here that the others lack of stage talent can be forgiven.<br/><br/>The one true nagging problem here (much like Peter Jackson choosing to shoot ""The Hobbit"" in 48 fps) is director Tom Hooper's choice to record all the singing live, which creates a very distracting atmosphere throughout. Allow me to explain: What Hooper actually did was fit all the actors with earpieces, which fed them the music, so only the actors could really hear the music and sing along. The problem with this is, that within the first ten minutes there arises a disjointed feeling when pertaining to the audio, making Jackman, Crowe and Hathaway all sound like they are singing either out of key or simply singing along with a track in the same way you might sing along to your favorite song in the car. Also, because maybe live acoustics aren't picked up as clearly as acoustics recorded in a studio and dubbed in later, at times the orchestra (which seemed to be layered in during post production) seemed to be lowered to the point where I felt that I wasn't getting that surround sound cinema quality that I'm used to hearing in a theater. Whatever it was, when listening and watching this film, it is very noticeable that something is audibly off as a direct result of the vocals having been recorded live.<br/><br/>Hooper, who is sure to get Academy recognition for his masterful direction, constructs a beautifully shot, to say the least, adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel turned musical. When Hooper shows the dingy slumps of France, the scenery is so gritty that you can smell it. But aside from Hooper's work on the visuals, the fact that this film contains the best wardrobe and set design of any movie to come out of 2012, should not be overlooked.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Is this the best picture of the year (a la ""King's Speech"" material)? No. Would this be considered as one of the top ten must see films of the year? Probably not. As great of a story as ""Les Miserables"" is, it's not without its faults, and will undoubtedly overstay its welcome with its unnaturally prolonged 15 minute conclusion; but if you are a fan there is a lot to appreciate here.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited Nicole I.

"zadkine","10","3","5","30 December 2012"," What is all this juice?
","A poet and priest, Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote in his very Christian poem ""Spring"" - ""What is all this juice and all this joy?"", referring to nature, God's creation, and I think the answer can be found in Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"". What is the essence of all this joy? It is beauty, it is creativity, and in ""Les Miserables"" both are a bit overwhelming. The deepest things are seen and heard in a fresh way. Someone said ""caring is the greatest thing"", and this film is all about caring, every kind of caring. A priest for the suffering, a mother for her child, man for his fellow man. And a deep caring is also reflected in the making of the film. So much is so original in the production that there's too much to mention, and remarkably the film's originality doesn't draw attention to itself, primarily because of the performances that are so direct and human. The formidable technological contributions don't get in the way. Everything serves the story. This is a year in which many of the best films are best seen in the theater - ""Lincoln"", ""Life of Pi"", ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"", and now ""Les Miserables""."

","I was ready for this film to be fabulous due to the incredible talents involved in making it. But being unfamiliar with the story before seeing the movie, I was unaware of how beautiful this story is. Jean Valjean is a hero of the first order. A man who was down and out, but when a priest offered him amazing help, it changed his life.<br/><br/>The film is different from the stage show, or so I've read, but it actually adds some things from the book that the stage musical left out. (I've been reading about it nonstop for 3 days now.) And this film is spectacular to watch. Stunning! The cast is superb. If Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway don't win Oscars it will be a crying shame. Aaron Tveit is especially good as well.<br/><br/>This film is quite long, yet when it came to an end all I could think was ""Gosh, I wish it was longer!"" I didn't want it to end. I will probably go see it again next week. It's THAT good."

","I love Les Mis (broadway) and know many of the songs by heart. I knew that this film would be a let down but I adore Les Mis so much I could not stop myself from watching it. Too late as I did not realize that watching this film would actually irritate me to the point of being mad enough to write this review. Horrible singing! Do they think we don't have ears and cannot hear the crap they are belching out? Just terrible casting! And this is after only watching it for 30 minutes. Pacing is also terrible. This is a dramatic and heavy musical and the filmmakers do not even give the audience the time to absorb anything in. I cant quite put it to words but after watching about 30 minutes of this film, I simply feel like I was cheated and abused."
"maximkong","5","7","17","26 December 2012"," The musical was great, can't say the same for this movie
","The musical was almost flawless, even though it was a compressed version of a great novel that had a lot more to tell. This movie, trying to be an exact copy of the musical, fell short of expectations, and my expectations were not great to begin with. Some of the actors were chosen well but most of the A list actors did not act as well as their counterparts in the musical, which is a sad fact given that the musical performers are unlikely to be perceived as serious actors and I felt the actors in the movie did not tackle their roles seriously enough when they were known for more challenging acting roles in their careers. And yes, I am not even mentioning that a lot of them can't sing well either. Was disappointed that the movie chose to stick wholly to the musical. It could have done a lot more, by bringing flash scenes or background stories in the middle of the songs to bring more colour and depth where the musical can't do, instead of opting for the horrible prolonged effect of the camera close up on the actors face, and I mentioned before, some of them did not act at their best. That said, the movie had a chance to add extra flavour from the novel but did not utilize this to its advantage. The changing of the scenes were too abrupt, that the impression I am left with is akin to a series of MV,for instance those who are not familiar with the musical may find it hard to identify who was the little Cosette when she first appeared because the transition changed too soon without warning. and that took away a lot of emotional attachment that I rmb from the musical. Some of the best scores were right at the beginning of the movie itself but the actors somehow managed to ruin the moment. The ending was another letdown in comparison to the musical's far more inspiring version."
"henrysaltandson","1","4","8","27 April 2015"," It's Tragic. So... So Tragic
","The reason why so many people decide to like this film is because they're afraid that if they don't, they'll seem cold or heartless. No one will ever admit that, but it's not a spoiler to tell you that the film is filled with tragedy. I first saw the musical on stage and it was breathtaking. I was so excited that I'd be able to relive that experience by watching it on my television whenever I wanted. That would have been marvelous!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the director, coming with the Oscar halo left over from The King's Speech, fancied himself a visionary. He chose celebrity actors who couldn't sing to play the parts ""raw and real,"" as Russell Crowe put it. This means it wasn't a musical. It was acted just fine, but it was all wonky. It came off worse than community theater, as if they were playing with the idea of singing, but were too self-conscious to actually do it.<br/><br/>The story, originally 1,000+ page book that I read every word of, could barely squeak into a musical. In the stage production there were lots of things happening very quickly, but the music made it work. If you want a truly profound experience hear On My Own, I Dreamed a Dream, or Empty Chairs at Empty Tables sung live with a professional company. I worry that this film has ruined that unique experience for many people who will have the talking/not- quite-singing performances stuck in their heads--Hugh Jackman doing a parody of Bring Him Home! (Really, Kristen Chenoweth's version from her new album, Coming Home, is a million times better. *She* can actually sing!)<br/><br/>The real tragedy is that no one is going to be rushing out to remake this film any time soon so we can have an adequate version of the Broadway experience for our Apple TV's and Blu-Ray players. Too many people glow about it. Too many people are ashamed to criticize a film about sad, sad people. ...and who wants to follow up and remake such a critically acclaimed film? It will be decades! I'm very sad."
"my_unique_nickname","1","4","8","29 December 2013"," A complete mess.

Separate songs are lost in a mess of lazy casual singing over things that don't need to be sung. If you can sit through this, and want to re-watch it, you may want to rethink what medications you are or are not taking.<br/><br/>Emotionally draining, stamina-crippling, and headache-inducing, I found this to be one of the worst movie experiences I have ever had. That is saying a lot when I have gone to film school, and have watched thousands of films over the years. I want to make a comparison to put this movie in a certain characterization: <br/><br/>""Les Miserables"" is to musicals as ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is to road-trip comedies.<br/><br/>Basically, it's dizzying, full of style to an extreme, and will have a very narrow following of fans. I'm really not sure how Anne Hathaway was given an Oscar for this... because she changed her hair style? Because she cried while singing a song that is purposely emotionally manipulative? Sorry to go on so much, but I am one of the many who thought this was a massive misstep."
"phoenix5511","5","4","8","3 February 2013"," Boring for a Les Mis' virgin.
","I got dragged by my girlfriend to see this movie as she had already seen the play and decided this would be her favourite film. I am a les mis' virgin and I did NOT want to see this film because I knew I'd be in for 2 hours of boredom. I was right. The entire film as I can remember is just 5 minute close up shots of the different actors faces while they sang a solo piece that wasn't interesting to watch or hear. Russell Crowe was the only thing I liked about it simply because I like him as an actor and it was interesting to hear him perform. Sacha Baron Cohen lightened up the mood a little but sometimes it seemed he was trying a bit too hard to be funny. I heard that I would be in tears during this film but when it finished I had not shed a tear for the entirety of it because I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters that died. I was told I must have no heart by my girlfriend but there was merely just bad character development, can you really feel sorry for a character that sings through an entire movie about how crap they feel? I have given this film a 5/10 because overall it probably isn't dreadful as a full movie, I just fail to see anything exciting in it. If you are a les mis fanatic I am sure you'll love it."

That being said for those who enjoy musicals, it is wonderful and I did enjoy the music. There was a bit of comedy thanks to the ""thiefs"" and the little blue eyed boy was remarkable... go see the movie, but bring Kleenex!<br/><br/>Poor Russell Crowe, I didn't see anything wrong with his singing, and wept openly at his final scene. I will do some research now on the subject of the movie, the French revolution, I believe and educate myself with a little bit of history. I will also download some of the music, which I loved."

You can tell he's not quite up for the job but he gives it a go and it doesn't matter because everyone else is outstanding and he does play the part well.<br/><br/>When the credits rolled the cinema actually burst into applause and it was well deserved.<br/><br/>Amazing film!!"
"jandcmcq","6","4","8","29 December 2012"," Where were you Alfie?
","I am giving 6 stars because I have been a long time fan of Les Mis since attending the premier of the show in Sydney in 1987 starring Normie Rowe, Debbie Byrne and the memorable Philip Quast as Inspector Javert. And I am being generous because of the enormous effort all of the crew have obviously put into this film and for the actors' acting performances. BUT I believe the creators have made a gigantic fatal error in the whole concept of the production. Instead of being the ""not to be missed"", ""most brilliant film of the year"" it has turned out to be just ""worth seeing"" and a ""very commendable effort"".<br/><br/>I am sure when the film was being conceived they must have first asked the question - Is the film a drama or a musical? Or is it a combination of both? To me what carries Les Mis is the wonderful heart rending MUSIC and SONGS. And great songs should be sung by great singers. Yes, I know there are commercial considerations and the star appeal of actors in various countries can make or break a movie. Was this the reason the producers have gone in the main for actors even if some have claims to be able to make a reasonable effort at tuning their vocal chords to lyrics? The answer to the question of drama or musical for Les Mis the film is evident in the screenplay as the spoken words versus the singing words could be counted on one hand. And Messrs and Madams producers, some of the songs in Les Mis are extremely demanding, even for trained opera singers and despite the fact that the actors tried their guts out, I am afraid they were given an impossible task.<br/><br/>I recognize doing it live with actors was very courageous and sure the actors poured their hearts out, but how they did it in the days of ""South Pacific"", ""Kiss Me Kate"", ""Carousel"" and ""Oklahoma"" with Howard Keel, Gordon MacRae and Kathryn Grayson and co was much, much more effective. And they didn't need a camera stuck in their face to pick up the sound or visual cutaways to distract from the off tune notes. Don't get me wrong I love Hugh Jackman and his performance in his own version of Oklahoma was outstanding - but the challenging vocal range required for Jean Valjean!!! And Anne Hathaway deserves praise for a gut wrenching ""I dreamed a dream"" but I don't think it will get 115 million hits on YouTube.<br/><br/>There was one notable exception to the rule of natural singers v actors trying to be singers and that was Samantha Barks who also played Eponine in the ""Les Misérables in Concert the 25th Anniversary"" who demonstrated how a song could be sung by a singer with ""On My Own"" and what a startling contrast to the rest? <br/><br/>But the greatest shame of all was that the real star of the 25th anniversary London show who made the Jean Valjean role his own and who raised rapturous applause to every song he sang, who could have made the film great, was missing in the film's casting."

","Two things: 1.I am a film major so there will be some ""inside"" look 2.I am a big fan of the book, musical... was not great but definitely good enough to make a film (compare to Chicago which is not the greatest show of them all but the film version is absolutely amazing).<br/><br/>But back to the ""Les Mis"": start with good things.<br/><br/>Ann Hathaway is pretty amazing: voice and acting-wise;<br/><br/>It is universal truth Hugh Jackman can sing;<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen is hilarious.... unless you hate him, of course;<br/><br/>Aaron Tveit (Enjorlas), is absolutely charming, energetic and stands out even more than Marius <br/><br/>There are really good songs there, even if you are not a big musical fan, and if you are - definitely go, just for the sound.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, regarding the ""good stuff"" that's about it....<br/><br/>Now, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS FILM:<br/><br/><ul><li>Back from the first trailer, I knew Russell Crowe was the beginning of the end...don't get me wrong, he is a great actor, but Javier?!?! The ruthless executor and absolutely negative character of the novel played by The Gladiator?! BIG BIG BIG casting mistake! You'll have to ignore this character throughout the entire film (not to mention he can hardly sing).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Please stop talking about how great production design was: the makers of this film have forgotten they are not in the theater, you cannot get away with 5 sets, poorly CGIed Notre- Dame and french revolution somewhere in the corner. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Script-wise, following the story-line of the musical, Fantine's part of the story seemed extremely rushed, which led to Valjean's affection to her absolutely unclear, the scenes where Jean was staying with the priest and stealing the silver later on, was completely neglected for the sake of Hugh Jackman's endless walking/singing back and forth in the chapel. This was an extremely important part of the story changing Valjean's character completely, and it was so poorly presented. In my opinion, some spoken lines should have been added, pure singing may work in theater but it always fails in film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cinematography is abysmal. Period. It looks like they shoot on Cannon 5D. The image is shaky, constantly out of focus (unforgivable for the price of the movie ticket which was $13.5 in my case), Anne Hathaway's ""I dreamed a dream"" was one continuous shot which was a terrible terrible cinematic decision. And again, cinematography and production design made me feel ripped off... where did the big budget go? To convince Russell Crowe to play the part not suitable for him?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And the last bad thing: stop shoving Helena Bonham Carter in every single film just because she has crazy hair. I don't even know what happened to her: after all these years of acting she looked like she had no idea what she was doing as Madame Thenardier. Not to mention she is way too skinny for the part. </li></ul><br/><br/>One more good musical was buried in ruins of bad cinematography... unfortunately for the fans, I'm only hoping they will not get their hands on the musicals I like.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure soon there will be actual viewers reviews with less stars and the deceiving rating (8 stars now which is over the top) will match the meta-score."
"dvigraphics01","8","4","8","22 December 2012"," I hate musicals, but...
","...this one was really great entertainment, from the start to the very end. I think that both Anne Hathaway, for her incredible rendition of ""I dreamed a dream"" and Hugh Jackman, for the whole performance - but in particular for the starting scenes when Jean Valjean is still a prisoner - deserve an Oscar. By far, the most stunning performances I saw in years. Helena Bonham Carter was as good as ever and Eddie Redmayne (who I didn't know before this movie) a great surprise too. The only thing that I hated (and I wasn't the only one, judging from the comments of the other viewers around me) was Russell Crowe: weak and totally inexpressive voice. I would have given 10 out of 10 with a less ""misérable"" choice for Javert's role."
"phaley98","2","6","14","31 January 2013"," A musical should be musical
","Speaking as a lifelong lover of musicals, this film fails for me on the most basic level - as a musical. Would you go to see a film of Carmen where Hollywood A-listers instead of opea singers were singing the lead roles? OK, Les Mis is laughably out of Carmen's league, but the principle is the same. Singing is the medium by which the story is told; therefore, the quality of the voice matters. If I'm going to listen to almost three hours of vocalizing, it had better sound good. The singing in this movie didn't, with a couple of exceptions: Samatha Barks was great, and the chorus was also very good. When you come to scenes like the students in the inn singing One More Day, you hear (with relief) what a musical is supposed to sound like. Personally I don't care whether the singing's live or dubbed, as long as the singer can do justice to the material. It would have been perfectly possible to cast singing actors from the many major productions of this show (as they did with Samantha) and then they could do as they pleased regarding live or taped singing. Just please give me actors who don't make me cringe with their amateurish efforts. The duets and quartets were especially painful, two or four mediocre singers basically singing solo over one another. There's a reason musicals hire actors with vocal ability and training.<br/><br/>Another aspect of hiring Hollywood stars is that it distracts from the characterization. It's hard to focus on the story instead of the novelty of Russell Crowe singing or Anne Hathaway doing the big number. I found myself focusing on how good a job they did, to the detriment of getting into the story. Never during ""I Dreamed a Dream"" did I forget, for even one moment, that this was Anne Hathaway I was watching.<br/><br/>And I don't want to hear that it's ""unrealistic"" for all the characters to have good voices or to sing well because of the setting or their character's situation. In the world of the film, they aren't supposed to be singing. That's just how they say their lines in a musical. And a good singer can ""act"" with their voice to create the appropriate effect for a scene or character while still sounding musical. Funnily, the film didn't really even take advantage of the opportunity for more intimate or nuanced vocals (with a few brief exceptions). Much of the music was sung at full tilt, just as if the actors had to project to the back row.<br/><br/>Beyond the vocal quality there are many other flaws: a poorly-paced story where events are suddenly dropped in without context (the uprising), an overlong running time, excessive use of close-ups, an almost complete failure to make the Valjean/Javert storyline comprehensible. With that much running time, that's inexcusable. <br/><br/>The filmmakers seem to pride themselves on having been radical by filming the songs live. But anybody can see the songs sung live, as Les Mis is a staple of touring companies and revivals. What would be daring would be to try to reshape the play into something that made a good film. The two media have different strengths."
"dead_man_inc98","1","5","11","24 April 2013"," Simply terrible
","My sister got this movie from Netflix and she my mom and I had been wanting to check it out. Now don't think that I don't like musicals. I have enjoyed The King and I, Chicago and Phantom of the Opera. I even like Sweeney Todd which is one of the oddest musicals out there.<br/><br/>But this movie was garbage. I watched my high school put on a production of this that was so much better than this movie. My high school didn't do a bad job either.<br/><br/>But this isn't about that. This is about the pour choice in casting (using people that couldn't sing properly), adding to or even rewriting songs from the original musical and then changing the order of some of the songs which just made it even worse than it would have been if they left it in order. Like I dreamed a dream didn't take place during the down fall of Fantine and shouldn't have been inserted into the middle of it. I couldn't even make it all the way through this pile of dung.<br/><br/>My mom and sister both made it through it and they didn't like it either. For me this has nothing to do with the performance done in the original production. This is about changing things that should not have been changed. Using people with big names instead of people who could sing. I was especially surprised at how bad Helena sounded since she sounded so good in Sweeney Todd. This is about people who took a great piece of worked and messed it all up.<br/><br/>The best singer I heard was the guy who played the Bishop and that should be no surprise since he played Valjean in the Broadway production. He was an actual trained singer. Imagine that. Using a person who knows how to sing to sing in a musical. Now if they would have done that with the rest of the cast then perhaps this movie would have been tolerable.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that I could have done a better job making this movie with no budget, people from the area of my hometown, a home movie camera and even using my home town as the setting. I could even use the local dump as a slave pit for crying out loud. And I still would have a better movie than this one.<br/><br/>If I was the person who wrote the original musical. I would sue the people who made this movie for screwing it up so badly. I honestly do not know how it is that so many people liked this atrocity. If it got so much as nominated I would be depressed that there must be such people with terrible taste in charge of the movie awards that they would actually consider this a work of art.<br/><br/>If you are wondering I made it as far as the Inn Keepers and I couldn't take another minute of this film. To those of you who made it through this steaming pile of crap. I take my hat off to you. You obviously have a higher tolerance for garbage than I do.<br/><br/>I would also like to say I didn't mind the singing of the girl who played the young Cosset."

","Picture it: Tempe, Arizona, 2002. I first got my glimpse into the play version of Les Misérables with my partner at ASU, the only time I've ever been (and since) on that campus. Honestly, I liked the experience of going to such an acclaimed production, but aside from one song/scene, I really didn't like it.<br/><br/>Nothing's changed, more than a decade later: I still love that one song and I disliked the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Let's get that positive out of the way. On My Own was an incredible song even when it was sung by one of the third-tier and almost irrelevant characters who shows up abruptly and leaves just as suddenly. To this day, this song breaks my heart and yeah, there's a big reason why – not to be revealed here. Regardless, it's absolutely not worth putting yourself through the rest of the incredibly bad soundtrack Les Misérables presents.<br/><br/>There. I said it. Les Misérables is a terrible musical and contains the worst music I've heard in any musical, with the exception, of course, of On My Own. And if you like this type of ""music,"" great, because for far too long screen time, they just sing words, mostly overlapping with no rhythm.<br/><br/>Oh, and while the story is moving, for a few moments of the 157 minutes, it just rambles on and jumps too many times to really get the feel of the characters. How many times can you say 8 years later without ever having anything interesting happening in between or these characters continue to live?<br/><br/>Slave, or so they say because he's really a prisoner, nobody Jean Valjean is ""released,"" sort of, for stealing bread, but when he breaks parole, he's is incredibly and unbelievably hunted by one policemanfor decades. (Sure, it was a different time, and yeah, in all eras people get obsessed, but c'mon now.)<br/><br/>So, get past that, and join the time-spanning journey of a man who says he's just, but then steals from the only one who wants to help, but then turns good. While sort of saving one female, he makes it his mission to care for her youth when she passes, abruptly.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, while Jack McGee is hunting this hulk'ing singer, a revolution happens and a boy out of nowhere is now Jean's son, sorta. And then when one character is shown true mercy – oh, I don't know for the fifteenth time, and finally gets it and learns to reciprocate, he decides it's best to take this life lessonimmediately to the grave. Huh?<br/><br/>Yeah, I know the story, and yeah, I'm mocking it by not giving the true movie synopsis – I did see the movie (and play) after all, but as the days pass since I watched this story again, I've had a bad taste in my mouth since. Sure, the production values, sets and cinematography were well done, but the songs, story and pacing alldon't shoot...sucked!<br/><br/>Okay, I'm in the minority on this one, but damn, people. Don't just follow the large posters because they show a little girl with messed up hair who only appears in the movie for an all-but split second. It's over-hyped and over-long. Skip it!"

","Les Misérables, meaning ""the miserable ones"" is a perfect depiction of life in France during the French Revolution. This movie was one of the most moving, and powerful motion pictures I've ever seen. I never read the book or seen the play, but this movie made me feel like I have, like I knew the story before it was shown to me. This movie had an immaculate revolution story, the feelings it gives you are strong and both sympathetic and empathetic. It makes me feel like I'm there with them, experiencing this the way they did. It is one of the best musicals I've ever seen. Hugh Jackman does an incredible job playing the character Jean Valjean, he brought this drunk criminal to life, he brings out the best in the songs with his amazing acting and even his amazing voice. He made Jean Valjean out to be trustworthy especially when he escapes prison to lead on a completely different life as a man who does nothing but help. <br/><br/>Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography, costumes, art design and editing are nothing short of genius. His idea for the actors to sing live during film really gave it much more emotion. There were a few times where the film encountered some pacing issues, but besides that it flowed beautifully altogether. Another amazing act was performed by Ann Hathaway in her role as Fantine. She lost 25 pounds and most of her hair for this role, not only did her amazing acting steal the show but her beautiful voice made it even more tremendous. Specifically, in her performance of the song 'I Dreamed a Dream', it was an Oscar in itself. However, the computer-generated imagery wasn't the best, but they created this amazing world while still being very realistic. This isn't a critic movie, so it makes it hard to critique it, it's more embed in the story and performance than the action and violence. <br/><br/>Overall this film is one of my favorite, and has left many crying, laughing, and inspired. It's old feeling and beautiful story reminded me of one of my other favorite musicals Moulin Rouge. Though they take place in different time, I still get those strong emotions and historical view through these actor's eyes. There incredible performances and the films story made the movies how great it is, and I wouldn't change anything about the story. Tom Hooper made the right choices throughout the whole creation of this film. I'm not familiar with the book or play of Les Mis but this movie gave me all the information I needed, to understand the film. The cinematography left me speechless and captured a live theater production for all cinema goers. Those in charge of this film knew precisely what they were working with. A few songs are shortened, several lines altered, and a few scenarios different from their original literary form, but the whole story remains gloriously and satisfyingly intact. This movie left me emotional; sad, happy, nervous, and apologetic, and I appreciated every moment of it. I recommend any and all movies goers to experience this true genius in film history."

Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen did manage to deliver subtly yet good performances even though they look bland and cartoonish.<br/><br/>But the same applause can't be said to Russell Crowe. My goodness, where to begin with? Although, Crowe's acting is good but singing is completely not good and completely this flaw could have ruined this movie if not saved by the performances of Jackman and Hathaway.

"majkowsknatalie","8","2","3","23 February 2017"," Les Miserables: A Great Production
","Considering the 2017 Academy Awards are coming up very soon, February 26th to be exact, I thought it was the perfect time to recap exactly why Les Miserables won three of the eight Academy Awards it was nominated for in 2013. Winning Best Supporting Actress, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Makeup all hold true when considering this films major strengths. Looking at the amount of singing, how the actors fit their roles, and the overall flow throughout the film are what make this production great. There is no doubt in saying that this film is musically-driven. I was a bit taken aback with the first scene when Russell Crowe, playing Javert, started lecturing Hugh Jackman, taking the role of a slave named Jean Valjean. To my surprise, every word was sung, right from the start! Even though I knew this film was based on a musical, I did not expect the singing to begin so early on, let alone be the very first words said by the actors. The idea that every word is going to be sung is startling at first, yet catchy and becomes expected after a while. In a way I enjoyed that the characters only sang their verses, because when a scene involving a violent reaction where you would expect a lot of yelling came up, their soft tones gave way to calm voices. This is where the excellent use of background music would pick up and add to the suspense or tension of the situation, hence the award for Best Sound Mixing. Once you do get used to the fact that the majority of what you will hear are the exceptionally graceful voices of the actors, the film flows quite nicely, showing exactly why Les Miserables is a great musical production. Speaking of the actors, they made this film ten times more enjoyable to watch due to their impressive performances. Anne Hathaway went beyond what I was expecting for the short, yet extremely important, time she was in the spotlight. Her emotions and body language shown were alarmingly believable. Especially in the most degrading scene where her humanity was violently stripped from her, Anne Hathaway's image was so convincing without her having to say a word. Another lead actor, Hugh Jackman, brought an act that was so natural and modest I was simply satisfied when he was performing. His ability to relate to the other actors on an emotional level, especially when deciding to take in Fantine's child after she passed, was very believable and sincere. The way that all the characters connect and come together in the end really solidifies any wandering thoughts or questions that may arise during the film. The way these actors present themselves in their individual roles and also together as a cast, makes this film flow so easily. Along with the connectedness of the characters, the way the producer continuously brings items and actors back into later scenes shows the importance of certain aspects throughout the film. For instance, the two silver candles that give Hugh Jackman his character early on in the film reappear multiple times, like a sort of motif. Along with this subtle addition in the film, the way each song moves into and out of the next so fluently adds to the overall neat and easy to follow story line. Over the course of many years, the actors also reappear with just enough of a changed appearance that it is hard to notice until they sing. Les Miserables achieves a great sense of flow by incorporating these qualities that give the film its greatness. Overall, Les Miserables is remarkably deserving of the Academy Awards it received in 2013. The film proved to be outstanding due to the musical talent, exceptional actors who played their roles perfectly, and the way the film created a sense of flow."

","When thinking of my least favourite genres Horror and Musicals come to mind, so as you can imagine I wasn't exactly ecstatic to see this film but I ended up very impressed with one of the better musicals I've seen in my life. I think for the most part this film was very impressive, it's not without its flaws but found this film to be very much worth the watch. When Tom Hooper won the Oscar for The Kings Speech the only thing that really bothered me about that was the fact that it didn't really put his talents on full display but their front and centre here, all the musical numbers and character direction is perfect, it really did make you believe the dire situation that these characters lived in and it truly proved to me his talent as a director. Hugh Jackman was absolutely brilliant in this film, not only is his singing voice fantastic but he carried a real burden and shame with him that Jackman perfectly portrayed. Few performances limited performances have impressed as much as Anne Hathaway in this film, her absolute emotional destruction was perfectly conveyed through her performance and created for some truly emotionally tragic scenes. When I hear bad things about Russell Crowes performance all I can do is scratch my head, I thought he was amazing in this film, he was a true antagonist who was not all the different from Valjean and I though Crowe brought true complexity to the character. This film also looks stunning, all the French streets, dirty alleys and poverty ridden areas truly gave out an impression that truly hooked me. But I don't think this film base some issues for one, after the first 20 minutes the film failed to really grip or interest me, it slowed the film down completely and seemed to spend to much time devoted to setting up the final act rather than give a compelling narrative of its own. The run time is also a bit excessive and the pacing drags quite a lot for me. Also seeing as it is a film called, The Miserable it's got a lot of really sad scenes that while obviously need to be there just don't make me want to go back and watch it again. <br/><br/>Everything from a technical and performance standpoint in this film is incredible, it's one of the best looking films in recent memory, while there's not a whole lot to drag me back to watch this again it's definitely a film worth watching that truly leaves an impression. <br/><br/>8.1/10: A- (Fantastic)"

"DMoney1184","6","2","3","3 September 2015"," A Mixed Bag--Not as Good as What You Would See on Broadway
","Les Mis is simply one of the greatest musicals ever put to stage. It's one of the longest running shows in Broadway history and is always getting revived on the Great White Way. This version.....ehhhhh<br/><br/>Okay, okay, the good: *Anne Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" sequence. I'm sure you've heard about this: it's all done in one take, the shot is kept close and intimate and Hathaway's performance just knocks it out of the park.<br/><br/>*Samatha Barks--Her Eponine is pretty great. She has an amazing voice and you can see her theatrical training coming through.<br/><br/>The Okay: *Hugh Jackman. I may getting plenty of dislikes for this but here it is. I love Jackman, he's a terrific Wolverine, he's fun, he throws himself into whatever he's working on. But ...he's just not the right choice for Valjean, I'm sorry, he's not. Valjean is a part clearly written for a legit tenor and Jackman is a baritone. You can hear it on Valjean's most famous number, ""Bring Him Home"". Jackman hits the notes but it's clearly a stretch and not where his voice wants to naturally sit. <br/><br/>The Bad: *Russell Crowe. Yeah, you knew this was coming. Russell Crowe, Russell Crowe. What the HELL were you doing in this movie? To his credit, he is in tune and he does know how to sing a musical phrase. But his STYLE of singing is so incredibly wrong, he's been the butt of a million jokes ever since the movie came out. Yeah, this just has to be one of the worst casting decisions made in cinema history.<br/><br/>*Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne. This is another one I might catch flack for. So be it. Seyfried has an INCREDIBLY distracting vibrato and Redmayne sounds like Kermit the Frog. I'm sorry, he does. Plus, the latter's performance of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables""...it just swings and misses. This is one of the big emotional moments of the show, Marius dealing with just this massive amount of survivor's guilt. In the show, I've seen actors tear at their clothes and hair and throw themselves down on their knees as they rage, ""Oh my friends, my friends! Don't ask me what your sacrifice was for!!"" And then as the music plays its last soulful notes, break down into open sobbing. Here, Redmayne just sits in a chair and looks pouty. It just doesn't serve the show well at all.<br/><br/>*The constant close-ups. In some scenes, like Hathaway's solo, they serve the movie well. But they are just way over used. The director looks very unimaginative in his choice of cinematography. The places you're taking us are fascinating--how about pulling the shot back so we can see some of them?<br/><br/>*Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonhem Carter. I'm sorry, I'm just tired of their....let's call it ""Burton-ing"". We seen it before, we'll see it again. They're not the worse part of the movie, by far (that's probably Crowe) but it's just so distracting. <br/><br/>So ....yeah, moments of the movie were good but as a whole, you can tell they just went with as many famous names as they could get and while some did an adequate job, you get the feeling there must have been better choices for a lot of the key roles (Javert, adult Cosette, Marius). If you get a chance to see it on Broadway, by all means, go and see it. You won't be disappointed. But this .....siiiiiggghhhh. You'll just have to take the good with the bad, I'm afraid."

","Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) has served 19 years of slave labor, under the watchful, vengeful, eye of police inspector Javert. (Russell Crowe) Valjean breaks parole, and escapes to the house of a kindly Bishop, (Colm Wilkenson) who forgives Valjean for stealing some silver. Valjean makes the most of this second chance and becomes mayor of Montreuil Sur Mer, and opens a factory. One of Valjean's factory workers, Fantine (Anne Hathaway) is a poverty stricken single mother who will do anything for feed her child, Cosette, (Isabelle Allen, Amanda Seyfried) including selling her hair, and her teeth, and becoming a prostitute, now Fantine is dying, and she wants Valjean to take care of the young Cossette. Always wary of the omnipresent Javert, Valjean pays off the owners of the inn where Fantine leaves Cosette, Thenardier (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Madame Thenardier (Helena Bonham Carter) and takes care of Cosette while still on the run from Javert. <br/><br/>Years later, Cosette meets Marius (Eddie Redmayne) who after an argument with his grandfather takes up the Revolutionary cause. Marius and Cosette fall in love immediately, but Eponine (Samantha Barks) also loves Marius, and is jealous of Cosette. Further complicating matters, Javert is still pursuing Valjean. Does Valjean ever escape Javert? How does the love triangle between Marius, Cosette and Eponine resolve itself? How does the French Revolution affect these people's lives? <br/><br/>When I first sat down to watch Les Miserables, I didn't think I'd like it much less deem it a classic. It's a musical and I'm not too keen on musicals from Broadway. In addition, the movie is set in French Revolutionary times, I thought I was in for a snoozefest. I was entirely mistaken, this is an enthralling, engrossing, captivating film, that draws viewers in from the first minute and keeps them engaged throughout. The songs, which I thought would be a weakness, turned out to be the strongest part of the movie and even aided in the exposition of the story. The movie dealt with the poor, hungry masses of France in a compassionate tender way, and blended their fates with the fate of the French Revolution in a beautiful, seamless way. Les Miserables doesn't try to force tears, it just tells a story and lets the emotion come naturally.<br/><br/>This is the role Hugh Jackman was born to play, and all this time, I thought it was Wolverine. Jackman's acting was as good as his singing. Russell Crowe was also very good acting and singing his lines. Anne Hathaway was wonderful in a small role as Fantine, and yes she can really sing.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add some much needed comedy relief, and Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks are actors who I've barely heard of. I saw Redmayne in My Week With Marilyn, a very good film, but had no idea he could sing. I didn't know Barks at all, and she had a heartbreaking, scene stealing performance. <br/><br/>The writing is superb, I'm sure it's difficult to take a 2000 page book by Victor Hugo and turn it into something that translates to the screen, but the story was told simply and effectively. The direction was superb, sometimes, there is nothing that catches my eye about the direction in movies but, this movie was different, there were all kind of crazy angles and shots, and France looked like a picture postcard, although I suspect some of that was CGI. I hope it was not most. Watch this movie, with someone who means a lot to you, you will both enjoy it.<br/><br/>Les Miserables. Revolutionary!<br/><br/>For more revolutionary movie reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

","I first saw Les Mes at 12 years old, and it changed my life forever...it instilled in me a passion for music and singing. Since then I have seen various shows, including Broadway and earlier movies. However, none of them compare to this release.<br/><br/>Twenty-One years after seeing Les Mes for the first time, I was awestruck by this film. I did not get a chance to see it in theaters, but bought the Blu Ray the day it came out. One thing is for sure...after not hearing any of the music in several years, I still knew every word by heart...that is the kind of effect this movie will have on you.<br/><br/>The cast in this film is nothing short of amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance was a huge surprise for me, as I am not usually a fan of his movies. Anne Hathaway once again shows us another side of her talent in her emotional, heart ripping, role as Fantine. Russel Crowe gave us yet another top notch performance as the merciless, and obsessed Javert.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne was the surprise to me in this film. I saw him in Hick and was impressed by his ability to command a scene. This film was no different, as he portrays the lovestruck Marius. As I understand it, he was also the only actor not classically trained in singing, though he sings one of the saddest pieces in the entire story...""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" Since I don't have room to go over the entire cast, I'll just say that for once, not a single character disappointed me...even Sacha Baron Cohen impressed me in this.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper turned an amazing story into a true work of cinematic art. It's apparent in this film that the story was more important than a paycheck, which is a rarity in today's film industry. It really shows that he put not only his mind, but his heart into Les Mes.<br/><br/>It is my deepest hope that Tom Hooper will decide to do another musical...personally...I'd like to see his vision of Phantom of The Opera."
"noaschenk","10","2","3","15 May 2013"," Amazing Movie
","This movie is amazing!! I went to the theaters and I didn't know what to watch, so I chose the movie with the greatest cast.<br/><br/>There was no minute in the movie I was bored, I loved the songs, especially when Russel Crowe sang. I laughed, cried and felt with the movie, that was really a big time movie ;). Anne H. deserved the Oscar. She sings a song for like three minutes without cuts. Amazing. This is really a must-see movie. I don't wanna tell to much of the content,but it is a beautiful love story in many ways ( Boy and girl/ Girl and Father/ Man and Government and citizens) . I can just suggest to watch that movie not on any internet side, buy it or borrow it and than watch it with the maximum on Audio. You're gonna be amazed too."

","this movie is absolutely beautiful, and i cry every single time. it is perfectly cast and the camera work is amazing; everyone's voices are absolutely beautiful and this movie was extremely well executed. i could watch this movie over and over, and it will never get old! i'm honestly not a very huge fan of musicals, but this is an exception. this movie is one of the best i've seen and completely worth it, and i'm shocked it doesn't have better reviews or has won an Oscar. i can't express enough how much talent is involved in this movie, and i can honestly say i think it is one of the top 10 best movies in 2012. you won't regret watching it! :)"
"playupbob","10","2","3","4 May 2013"," A stunning adaptation of one of the greatest works of modern theatre.
","I'll be honest, I'm not too certain Les Mis is deserving of the 10/10 I gave it (having just come back from seeing it for the first time I still felt all the hype it had surrounding it), as it is flawed in parts. Some of the casting is way off: Amanda Seyfried was more bird than human, the Thenardiers were all wrong- I think they are both incredible actors, but Sacha Baron Cohen's French accent really put me off and Helena Bonham Carter essentially tried to do a carbon copy of her role in Sweeney Todd, just without the charm and I felt she sounded bored while singing- and what is there to be said about Russel Crowe that hasn't been said before? (although, he is nowhere near as bad as some people make him out to be). So many lines were taken out of the script, largely to make it shorter for the movie-going audience and to make place for the new number ""suddenly"" and the extended sequence with Valjean and young Cosette, all of which seemed a bit pointless and out of place to me.<br/><br/>Apart from these factors, this film is a wonderful work of art. Some of the changing around worked- the replacement of On My Own, for example- and it definitely made it more of an adaptation than than a direct copy of the stage show. The remaining members of the cast were excellent. Anne Hathaway was fully deserving of the awards she received for her portrayal of Fantine and possibly the most moving rendition of I Dreamed A Dream ever. Hugh Jackman (the last notes of Bring Him Home aside) carried the film superbly and really brought across Valjean's emotions during the prologue and at the end. Eddie Redmayne is a very talented young actor with a voice to match and shone next to the aforementioned Amanda Seyfried. For me, though, Samantha Barks stole the show. Very rarely do movie musicals include perhaps lesser-known stage actors and her part in the film shows future directors that this is the way to go. Most of us knew she was good anyway, but her brilliant voice and heartbreaking singing in On My Own and Little Fall Of Rain really captured me.<br/><br/>The story is just as everyone remembers- prisoner breaks his parole, policeman chases him, schoolboys try to start a revolution, everyone dies. I think what the film does very well is combine aspects of the show and book to form the storyline, so fans of both understand it. As ever, it is packed with emotion. If Les Mis doesn't move you to tears, you probably aren't a human being. The music is stunning and the orchestration has been given a new life (I admit, I prefer how it sounds on stage, but there's no denying how good it is and how well it works). Many people have made complaints about the direction and the actors singing live. Personally, I find this makes it better as you are getting the emotion from the acting and singing at the same time, but each to their own. The camera is a bit jumpy and close-up happy, but there is a lot for the audience to see throughout the 2 and a half hours of screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a masterpiece (and should have won the Oscar for Best Film!!!). While not technically great or critic-pleasing, I'm sure it will win you over from the start. I stick by the 10/10"
"joshuaflynn","10","2","3","3 May 2013"," I don't like musicals
","I don't understand how you can knock this film at all, even if it is a musical. The music is phenomenal, with a surprising excellent performance from Russell Crowe, who in my book played and sang his role the best. You can't help but feel for the characters, especially in the scenes such as; The final battle and Javert's suicide. Hugh Jackman also does a fine job singing, even though he is recognised for portraying Wolverine in the X-Men films. Anne Hathaway's version of ""I dreamed a dream"" is outstanding and I don't believe any other actress could pull it off as well as she did. Even if you don't like musicals (like myself), you should definitely see this masterpiece of a film."
"danjakubik","9","2","3","30 April 2013"," An engaging musical filled with emotion
","""Les Miserables"" (2012) is certainly the most musical of musicals I've ever experienced. This famous Victor Hugo story has been adapted countless times. This ambitious film version features a wide range of characters and the story is told almost entirely through song. I did not have a problem with the highly active cinematography and film editing. Some have criticized the film for excessive camera movement and film editing. ""Les Miserables"" has a large scope with many characters. The camera is always moving in for close ups of characters singing. It's an entirely different experience than a stage musical version, where an audience views the story on a large scale. I agreed with the active camera work of the film, to emphasize the emotions of all the characters. There are a couple of comical characters, which I felt weakened the impact of the film. ""Les Miserables"" is very much a drama, one about love, honor and redemption. For those who dislike musicals or admire stage musicals, this film version of the famous Victor Hugo story might seem overly long and excessive with emotion and song. I had no problem with it's 157 minute running time. It's a big story that requires significant length to best be told. What's unusual about the making of this film is all the actors are singing live on camera, without post dubbing. Anne Hathaway's strong performance is certainly one of the highlights of the film, in addition to the directing, music score, art direction, costumes and makeup."

","I first heard they were making this by my aunt. I remember that my younger brother and I stayed with her. Her and her partner took us out to London and took us to Greenwich University where her partner worked. They took us down cause this was being filmed there for a few scenes just outside in the courtyard. We even saw a few takes being done and what an amazing experience it was seeing this happen. My hopes of the future is to be in the movie business. This has been for my whole life.<br/><br/>Months later I saw the trailer and there it captured me immediately. My family and I saw it a few days after its release. Our minds were all just blown away from how brilliant it was.<br/><br/>The story was captivating and compelling. I never actually read the book, seen the stage show or any of the other movie adaptations. So this was all brand new to me.<br/><br/>The acting was astonishing and the character development was fantastic. I love the fact that they actually sang on set, not added in post production. Everyone of the cast's singing voices were amazing. There was not one voice that I didn't like. Hugh Jackman was the star of the show, my family and I are so disappointing that he didn't win the best actor award in at The Academy Awards. He deserved it. But I am so happy that Anne Hathaway won the Supporting Actress award. Her acting was brilliant and when she sang, my mouth gaped open and had goosebumps all over me. Even Russel Crow surprised me of how well he sang as well. My family and I now own the soundtrack of the movie and have the Blu Ray copy pre ordered. <br/><br/>The cinematography was fantastic. Tom Hooper has an eye for extremely creative shots. The direction and choreography was stunning.<br/><br/>Honestly I can't point out anything bad about this movie. It was absolutely superb. I highly recommend you see this you won't be disappointed. Definitely recommend you families out there to watch it all together. You're in for an emotional and compelling experience."

","People seem to be confusing their subjective taste in movies to an objective appraisal of the movie - if a movie is not to your taste, it does not make it a bad movie, and you shouldn't base your rating on whether you liked it or not. People making ratings based on their taste are making the movie rating here unreliable.<br/><br/>The people who voted 0 or 1, I'm talking to you. How can you not give credit to the amount of details that have been put into the movie? How can you not give credit to the performances put forward by these actors and actresses - acting and singing simultaneously is not easy, especially when it is done live. Those of you complaining about how the actors cannot sing, and they should have hired professional singers. let me ask you, would you rather watch professional singers who can sing but who can't act in a movie? That would have been worse. This is a movie, not a stage opera. Apples to oranges.<br/><br/>There are many other examples but my point is that the movie is not getting credit where credit is due, because people are throwing ratings out based on their taste, and not based on how the movie actually is.<br/><br/>I'm giving the movie a 9. There was an unnecessary amount of camera shaking, or else I would give it a 10."

","Les Miserables 2012: If you haven't seen Les Miserables on Broadway then you might be confused as you travel through this world of loud and gut wrenching song. This movie is not for people who do not like drama and long movies. Anne Hathaway won an Oscar for her role in this but you will not see her for long. She pretty much sings a very famous song and looks like a beggar with a bad pixie cut. She goes through nearly every human emotion in one song and pulls it off. Hugh Jackman as ""24601""earns every cent he earned for doing this movie. He literally sings until he has nothing left in him. This movie was for eager Hollywood actors who didn't want to leave it for the pros. All things considered, they did a great job. Russell Crowe had a hard time because his singing usually comes with a guitar, a band and some bad ass on the side. I liked his portrayal of Javert despite his apparent struggle to hold a note every now and again. I loved the musical so I am very biased. Other than Jackman who would have gotten the Oscar if it wasn't for Your Highness Mr. Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln; Eponine and Marius steal the show. Sasha Baren Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and Amanda Seyfried close up the gap for Who's Who in this musical powerhouse and do not disappoint."

","Genre - Drama, Musical and Romance Director - Tom Hooper Screenwriters - Claude-Michel Schönberg, Alain Boublil, Victor Hugo, Herbert Kretzmer, Alain Boublil, Jean-Marc Natel, James Fenton, William Nicholson Main Actors - Hugh Jackman (Jean Valjean), Russell Crowe (Javert), Anne Hathaway (Fantine), Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) Plot Summary - In 19th Century France, Jean Valjean is released from prison on parole, but breaks this when he meets Father Myriel who helps him become a new man. He builds a successful life for himself as the head of factory, and is known as the Mayor of Montreuil-sur-mer. Unknown to him, one of his employees, Fantine is fired because of an illegitimate baby. She becomes a prostitute in desperation to support her daughter, Cosette, who lives with the Thénardiers. Fantine is arrested by Javert, but Valjean forces him to release her. He hears her story, and as she is in poor health on her death bed, he promises to look after Cosette for her.<br/><br/>Another man is arrested and mistakenly identified as Valjean. Valjean appears in court, revealing the truth about his identity. He looses his position in Montreuil-sur-mer, but escapes Javert again and takes Cosette with him, moving from place to place for 10 years, always just staying ahead of Javert, who is continuously following them. Cosette meets Marius and they instantly fall in love. Marius is a college student, who, joins the revolt that is the result of politics, work issues and unsatisfactory conditions in Paris. When their barricades are taken, Valjean rescues him and escapes through the sewers. They meet Javert who, when Valjean doesn't back down from trying to save Marius, kills himself.<br/><br/>Cosette and Marius marry, and Valjean reveals his past to Marius, who promises not to tell Cosette. Valjean dies, content to know that Cosette is happy with Marius.<br/><br/>Review - I really like this musical, as it is very moving and portrays the life in France at the time very well. It uses the music to create more emotion, and emphasise the way life was in the 19th Century. As it includes both joyful, upbeat music, such as 'At the end of the day', and very deep, sad music, such as 'I dreamed a dream', it creates the atmosphere that I haven't found in any other musical. I think that the way it is always filmed close up makes the feeling more effective and adds an overwhelming force and power. It has a huge physical effect on the viewers, and is completely unique. The only thing I dislike about this film is that it doesn't have any spoken words in it; which means that some of the words are sang tunelessly, as there is no way to make them into some kind of song.<br/><br/>My favourite part of this film is the scene where Valjean is rescuing Cosette from the Thénardiers because they create some of the only comedic scenes in this film, and they feature in this part; you see that they are con artists in their own, individual and humorous way. Also, it is quite touching because it portrays what life was like for a working girl like Cosette, who had to do almost all of the work, and shows how much she wanted to get away from her family because of how they treated her, by showing her running away with a kind and fatherly man who is a complete stranger to her. My least favourite part of this film is the scene where Fantine becomes a prostitute in her urgency to find money for Cosette, and is slowly dying because of it, as it is very, very sad, but also contains the song 'I dreamed a dream', which really makes you think about what life could have been like for her under different circumstances. It also shows you what her life was like really, and doesn't leave out the fact that it is so easy to get in trouble with people who are more well off, and are just looking for fun, if you do something, if only a small thing, wrong.<br/><br/>My favourite character is Javert because although at first you think he is going to completely ruin the lives of Cosette and Jean Valjean, in the end he forgives them, and realises how completely wrong he has been all those years about Valjean which means he kills himself. As he is played by Russell Crowe, he is very intimidating and always seems to sound angry. But then when you hear him sing, and realise that he has been wrong about Valjean, he becomes very gentle and looses all his anger which, although unexpected, makes his voice into something that could be listened to again and again.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this musical to others as it is an amazing way to show people how life was, and it is one of the best films I have seen. From watching this film, I have learnt that not all the best films are spoken, and that an orchestral accompaniment can have a hugely powerful effect on the audience"

","Based on the musical of the same name by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg, 'Les Misérables' Directed by Oscar-Winner Tom Hooper, is visually stunning & monumentally directed, but what turns out to be the biggest strength of this enterprise are the Outstanding Performances by its terrific ensemble cast! <br/><br/>'Les Misérables' tells the story of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who becomes mayor of a town in France. Soon exposed, Valjean agrees to take care of Cosette, the illegitimate daughter of the dying Fantine, but as a fugitive must also avoid being captured again by police inspector Javert. The plot spans 17 years & is set against a backdrop of political turmoil.<br/><br/>'Les Misérables' is a hard film to make, but Director Tom Hooper executes it with so much conviction & dedication, that it doesn't fail on any level. This Musical is Stunning! The Adapted Screenplay is strong. Tom Hooper's Direction is monumental. Cinematography by Danny Cohen is stunning. He captures every moment beautifully. Editing, Art Design & Costume Design, are incredible.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Anne Hathaway, in an Oscar-Winning Performance, astonishes as Fantine. Not only does she sing amazingly, but her performance is beyond imagination. Hugh Jackson, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is haunting as Jean Valjean, He, too, is an amazing singer. Russell Crowe as Javert, is decent. Eddie Redmayne as Marius Pontmercy, is first-rate & is also a gifted singer. Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, is fair. Helena Bonham Carter & Sacha Baron Cohen play the Thénardiers, hilariously. Aaron Tveit as Enjolras, is expressive. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Les Misérables' is a major success."
"gbabbitt30","8","2","3","7 April 2013"," Excellent Adaptation That's Not For Everybody
","As a precursor to this review, it should be noted that for me, seeing a movie made from a stage play is quite like seeing a movie made from a book--if you loved the original, you will nitpick the movie to death because it doesn't hold to your images and love for the original. That said, 'Les Miserables' as musical movie is pretty darned good. The visual effects of Parisian poverty and the 'miserable' life of many of the characters does in fact add an element of reality to the movie that the theater can't give us, and Tom Hooper certainly did his best to convey the image of a time and place where life truly didn't seem worth living to the masses of destitute French citizenry. For my own taste, some of the scenes were a bit too stylized, and Fantine's time among the working girls seemed more art than drama, but on the other hand, the scenes of the students and the barricade were truly magnificent, as were the sewer moments. It was great to see Colm Wilkinson in the role of the Bishop after having seen him as Valjean in London. Magnificent performer! As for the acting and singing. . .I did not expect much from Hugh Jackman but will readily admit: Boy, was I was wrong on that one. Jackman may not have the vocal range of Wilkinson or Alfie Boe, but I certainly came away believing he WAS Jean Valjean. Splendid performance that really carried the character and the story throughout. Eddie Redmayne was an excellent Marius, and Samantha Barks gave a good rendition of Eponine. After that, the rest of cast--Ann Hathaway included--were admirable, but not outstanding. I can only believe Hathaway won her Academy Award on the basis of cutting her hair and looking extraordinarily pitiful in one song. Baron-Cohen as Thenardier was a huge miscast. Steve Martin could have done better. As a visual experience, Les Miz The Movie was quite a treat. I have to wonder though. . .if you had not seen the stage play and were not already familiar with the story, how in the world would you be able to follow what was going on? It's terribly difficult to identify what is happening with all the characters when all dialog is sung, and it's hard to match operatic vocals with the tremendous visual impact on the screen in front of you. Be that as it may, this was a superb movie, and well worth anybody's time."
"lindseykulak","10","2","3","8 March 2013"," Loved it!
","I am a HUGE fan of the show. I have the London cast on my iPod. When I saw online that they put Colm Wilkinson in the movie I was thrilled! I saw it last weekend in the only theater that was still showing it in Pittsburgh. I only had a few complaints. One is that they changed the order of the songs. (If you haven't seen it yet, they changed I Dreamed a Dream to after Lovely Ladies, and rearranged the order of the Do you Hear the People Sing/One Day More/On My Own) as well as that I didn't feel they showed Hugh Jackman's Valjean age enough. In my opinion he looked older in the chain gang scene than in the death scene. Other than those 2 complaints I absolutely loved the movie! I almost cried during the Epilogue. The way they show the revolutionaries who died was absolutely amazing! Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers were HILARIOUS! Anne Hathaway definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. She was amazing. I definitely recommend this to anybody. 10 out of 10!"

","Beautiful photography, very dark and gloomy as you would expect. There's nothing left to say about the storyline, I mean, it's a classic. Acting is good, specially Anne Hathaway's she was impressive! Who would have thought the girl could act like that!!? She might win the Oscar for that. Hugh Jackman makes a great job as well. <br/><br/>Editing is beautiful and art is amazing, from the makeup to the sceneries. They do have a power cast, of course, but they also introduce some new faces that are worth watching, specially Samantha Barks in the role of Eponine. Finally, one of the most important aspects, the music was incredible. I do not believe for a minute all those actors sing that good but music editing is surreal. <br/><br/>The movie is pretty much amazing, a little bit too long, which was expected but pretty much worth the time."
"ihab-azar","10","2","3","12 February 2013"," A masterpiece to those who can appreciate
","Its been a few hours after i left the theatre and my heart is still beating. This has been one of the most amazing films i have ever experienced. From the distinguished cast to the unique (sometimes exhausting) cinematography, this film, for me, felt like a masterpiece. Being a huge fan of both the Victor Hugo novel and the stage musical, i went into this with somewhat moderate anticipation since many great musicals lost their charm when transferred to the big screen (The phantom of the opera for instance), and for the first few minutes i thought that i was right due to the opening sequence that wasn't as strong as it was on the stage and because of the unconventional cinematography that includes many close-ups and the camera is constantly on the move when there isn't a close-up. As the film progressed however i started to really love it and the cinematography was beginning to seem effective and started, along with the performances and music, to strike my heart like lightning bolts. The cast of this film are mostly excellent and donated greatly to the experience. Hugh Jackman really surprised me when he gave a brilliant Jean Valjean. His acting skills were superb and while his singing wasn't perfect, it was just as effective it should have been. As much as i heard that Russel Crowe was bad in this film, i have to say that i thought he was pretty good. don't get me wrong his singing was average, possibly a little below average, but that didn't really bother me that much. He still gave good acting and his voice' tone always suited Javert moods and reflected his feeling in an impressive way. The young cast was also brilliant and on top of them the wonderful Samantha Barks whose film debut worked perfectly. Her Eponine was very good. Amanda seyfrid as Cossete, and the gentlemen who play Marius and Enjolras were also great, and the actors who played young Cosette and gavroche were very wonderful to look at. Sacha-Baron Cohen and Helena Bonaham-Carter work perfectly as the comic relief characters, their singing was average (Then again their roles don't require much vocal talent so it's not considered a flaw here). But of course, the best of the cast was without a doubt Anne Hathaway as Fantine. Rarley do i see actors or actresses give such raw, emotional performances as Hathaway did here. Her performance of ""I dreamed a dream"", add in the extreme close-ups was absolutely astonishing and as many have already stated, she WILL win the Oscar for best supporting actress. The cinematography was as mentioned earlier, unconventional and strange. Tom Hooper's strategy of capturing the performance by having the actors to sing live and shoot it in extreme close-ups, with the camera constantly moving in order to capture the performance, was at first very exhausting to look at and i can see why some people didn't like it, feeling that the movie was somewhat ""shoving"" itself in their face. But as the movie advanced and i got used to this technique, i found it to be very effective and heart-gripping, keeping you constantly captivated and helps you focus on the smallest of details of the actor's facial expressions. All in all this film is NOT for everyone. People who like musicals will probably be enchanted and cry like babies at some moments. Those who aren't in to musicals will most likely hate it and describe it as boring. SO if you can appreciate this kind of film, see it and cherish it for what it is: A unique musical film that will move you and fill your heart with hope and caring for the wretched of the earth. Les miserables (2012): A moving, unforgettable cinematic experience"
"ChetXBuck","Null","2","3","31 December 2012"," An Epic, Powerful and Long Acting Lesson (But not a singing lesson)
","Overall, I'd give Les Miserablés the 2012 movie a big thumbs up. I've seen the musical five times, three of which were on Broadway. I own the original cast recording and have listened to it probably 40 times. But I was unsure what to expect when Tom Hooper tried to convert it to the big screen. <br/><br/>However, this is director Tom Hooper (director of Oscar Best Picture winner, ""The Kings Speech"") with a cast of superstars (Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen, etc.) Hooper is an expert at both driving awesome character acting and historic epic drama. Which will he focus on for Les Mis? And what about the fact that this is the biggest ""musical"" of all-time and has millions of devotees worldwide---how do you keep them happy too?<br/><br/>Well, they way I look at it, it's like the Designated Hitter in baseball. You focus on acting or on singing. The DH would be like having actual Broadway style singers sing and actual Hollywood actors act... they have their role (AL style.) To ask a pure actor (e.g. Russell Crowe) to sing would be like having pitchers bat (NL style.) So, in effect, you can't easily excel at both. You must choose. Hooper chose actors to act and sing and decided to film them live for each scene, obtaining raw facial expressions and emotions, but sacrificing quality of voice.<br/><br/>As a result of this epic confluence of film, I decided to pick ten things I like about Les Mis (2012) and an equal number of things that do not work. In brief, here they are the ten that work. Will post 10 that do not separately.<br/><br/>This is a three-hour film and nearly four-hour musical, so there's a lot to discuss.<br/><br/>This will only make sense if you've seen the new movie or know the musical, story or book: CONTAINS SPOILERS <br/><br/>> 10 Things that Work: <<br/><br/>1) Crisp, Great Storytelling: Director Hooper manages to make this absurdly complex story with dozens of characters flow very, very well. Even if you've seen the musical, the characters and story flow and come alive very well. I found a number of people who did not know the story (amazingly) and this movie was a solid introduction to the story. He deserves an Oscar nomination just for making this movie work on screen, not because it's the best film of the year.<br/><br/>2) Hugh Jackman is brilliant in almost every way. Wow. He hit both great acting and solid singing and was more than believable as the troubled yet loving Jean Valjean. His makeup and aging was very real, and he owned the character. Kudos to Jackman and Hooper for bringing Jean Valjean to life like never before.<br/><br/>3) YES! Javert is complex, not evil. Most productions of Les Mis get this all wrong! They portray Javert primarily as pure evil. However, the complexity of this character--one who sees the world through the lens of the law and in the black and white of right and wrong--this nuance is often destroyed by the live show. In 2012, I saw a touring version of the show in which Javert is evil and vengeful 100% of the time. That's just wrong. He's not meant to be hated, he's meant to be there as a complex anti-hero.<br/><br/>4) Éponine by Samantha Barks: Often in the Broadway show, the young new star with a great voice gets this role, so she soars on each song. Barks had both the emotional draw to understand her dilemma and the voice to sign it out right. Great performance.<br/><br/>5) Sacha Baren Cohen as Thénardier: He's over the top, but so is the character in the theatrical production. Baron Cohen is perfectly cast and lightens the film when it direly needs his comic relief, midway through this three-hour film. I thank Hooper for casting him. Jack Black and many other similar comedic actors would not have worked in this role.<br/><br/>6) The student revolution: During the live musical, the student revolution is part of a complex array of story lines that erupt in the second half. Often the rationale for their revolution and their loyalty to the general get lost in all the other stories. This time, it works. You can understand their goals and motives much better.<br/><br/>7) The Paris and countryside cinematography: There are four or five awesome moments in cinematography that explode on the big screen. For those waiting to see this on DVD, forget it--this is a big screen movie and you'll lose it in your living room. But it's fantastic in a big theater.<br/><br/>8) Saved by the Bishop. The storyline of the faithful and merciful Catholic Bishop changing Jean Valjean's view of the world is very important to the story. It's the turning point for the main character and often gets brushed over in the musical or you just don't believe the story. The bishop is sincere and believable in the movie. He also appears later in the film to remind you of his importance. Well played, Hooper.<br/><br/>9) Action scenes and editing: The opening scene totally changes our view of the ""chain-gang"" compared to the musical. You get how risky their work is and how truly imprisoned they are in their lives. The battle scenes are also strong as are some of the fight scenes, escape scenes, chase scenes and Javert's death--which is always a key moment.<br/><br/>10) The Thérnardier's Inn: This scene is important in the musical to lighten it up and give you a sense of the role of travel and Inns from that era of history. This over-the-top version of the Inn loses all believability to exaggerate the badness of the innkeepers, but it totally fits and makes you laugh and cringe at the same time."
"db-beurylaw","10","2","3","30 December 2012"," fantastic . . .mais pouquoi?
","One of the best movies I ever saw. I always read through the reviews of people who loved or hated it and was surprised how off base the haters are. They generally hat two things: the close ups when the stars are singing and the fact that some of the singing is less than perfect. Both are choises made by the Director Hooper.<br/><br/>I thought the close ups added to the power and emotion of the performances. this is, after all, an over powering tragedy. Every character suffers unjust incarceration, extreme poverty, degradation, the killing of all their friends, etc. I felt the close-ups laid the emotions raw and was extremely effective.<br/><br/>Other reviewers, both professional and users, faulted various performers' singing as being less than perfect. This was a unique decision of Hooper to have the performers actually sing on the set, instead of pre-recording the songs in a studio and then lip-sync on the set. Most reviewers were in favor of the lip syncing. Really? You prefer the fake over the real? I grew up in Las Vegas and saw most of the great singers of our time live. There is no way I would have preferred to watch Streisand or Sinatra lip sync. A few sour notes is a small price to pay for the realism of the performance.<br/><br/>It appears that some reviewers are looking for some flaw, any flaw as a way to discredit a masterpiece. From beginning to end it was a wonderful experience. I saw the play three times and each time I went home and the experience stuck with me. The same thing with this movie. My only real criticism is when Jean Valjen rescues Marias and drags him through the sewers he is covered in pooh. A whole lot of pooh. Just his eyes were poking out through the pooh. Did we need that much pooh? We got the idea, it was a filthy sewer and he was willing to do anything. And then he encounters Javier (Russell Crowe) who is resplendent in a period uniform. I just wanted Valjean to throw a handful of pooh on him.<br/><br/>My other question is where were the French actors? The whole story is about French patriots dying for France. It all takes place in France and every single character is French. The main actors Crowe and Hugh Jackman are from Australia and New Zealand. The actresses, Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried are from New York City and Pennsylvania. The rest of the entire cast is British. I'd be willing to bet that not one of the extras in what appears to be 20,000 extras in finale was French. Heck in the Dark Knight Rises, one of the main characters was French, even when that made no sense. The 2012 Oscar winner for best actor is French and is famous for being a singer, but not a single part was found for a French performer. It was like re-making West Side Story without a single Latino, Porgy and Bess without a single African American or Music Man without a single American. Here we had performers sing how they were willing to die for France, but they were not willing to cast one. And only one word in the entire film was uttered in the French language and that was ""Bonjour"". Very odd.<br/><br/>But of course, none of this really detracted from an emotional and satisfying film experience."
"seh-7","10","2","3","30 December 2012"," Sets the standard for all future film musicals. PS: Take tissues!
","I'll declare my colours at the outset: Les Miserables is one of my favourite books and I love the musical. So I was really looking forward to this film. <br/><br/>It did not disappoint. This film will set the bar high for any future filmed adaptations of beloved musicals. <br/><br/>The way the shots are framed, the use of CGI and sets, the aerial shots to give you the scale of Paris, the brilliant scenery.... it's all amazing. But what is best is that the actors sing live - in other productions, even where the lip syncing is done well and the performers are great actors, it just feels a bit fake when they jump into song because they didn't do it live. There is none of that here. Singing live gives the actors a chance to lead the music, take charge and act the songs. The result is that if you adore the musical you might find yourself occasionally out of step when singing along (and I apologise to everyone sitting around me.... I did *try* to contain myself to just mouthing the words but think I got a bit carried away at times!) But the best result: the emotion is real. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is brilliant as Jean Valjean and should get an Oscar. Anne Hathaway has made no secret that she wants an Oscar for Fantine and is playing the Oscar game hard, but you know what? She'd deserve if she got it. Everyone in the cinema was sniffling and then bawling through Fantine's descent into hell and eventual death. Samantha Banks as Eponine is gobsmackingly good. Her version of On My Own will be THE version forever more, in much the same way that Elaine Page is associated with Memory. <br/><br/>While it was a little jarring to see some of the songs chopped down and the order of the songs shuffled around, it actually all makes sense - for example, it is far more powerful to hear I Dreamed A Dream after Fantine has lost her job, her hair, her teeth and started working on the docks as a prostitute. In the musical, it's after she loses her job and before she hits rock bottom. To hear ""this hell I'm living"" is so much richer and emotional when you see Fantine at rock bottom. Do You Hear The People Sing is a far better to rally to arms at Lamarche's funeral than after the revolutionary students' wine-fuelled rants. <br/><br/>But.... there is one but. Or maybe two. <br/><br/>I don't really get why they put in a new song, even if it did give Hugh Jackman another solo and a bit of extrapolation to get from the Theniedar's pub to the convent. When they are chopping down and out some others, why add more? But it didn't interrupt the flow of the film and added some storytelling, so I'm not overly phased. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe is not a theatrical singer. He can sing, far better than I expected. And he is good as Javert - he acts well and he sings OK. But that's just it: he's good, but he's not great. When everyone else is so great (and some of Javert's songs are the strongest in the score!) you need a strong Javert. He should have been spitting out the words ""I was born with scum like you, I am from the gutter too!"" but it felt like Rusty was just doing all he could to act, swing a sword and stay in tune - there's no power behind it, no matter how well pitched his vocals are. Stars was disappointing, but that's a personal thing - it's one of my favourite songs! <br/><br/>Go out and see it. But take tissues. You'll need them!"
"eapplebaum","10","2","3","29 December 2012"," loved it! Maybe this will inspire to bring back the Musical FIlm. :)
","The movie is fantastic. It's a little sad that the movie is SO significantly better than the play. I did not really know what the heck was going on when I saw the play. And the music is good in the play BUT in the film, everything is so vivid, up close and I know I should be shot for saying this... But I actually liked the way Anne Hathaway sang I dreamed a dream better than Patty Lapone. Something about the way Anne Hathaway sang it, more personal and emotionally connected than the ""theater"" version, Patty Lapone sings just made it so great. And ALL the characters are so much more tangible. Sacha B Cohen is PERFECT with Helena B Carter. Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar. The other actors were amazing too...Cosette young ..totally adorable & older Amanda S, Marius (Eddie R), Éponine (Samantha Barks) even Russel Crowe, all of them were wonderful. If you like musicals this to me is a brilliant combination of film and theater. LOVE IT!! Can't wait to see more like this. :)"
"cvakalis0521","10","2","3","28 December 2012"," A really stunning movie.
","While I heard of Les Miserables, I never actually knew what it was about or had seen it in the movies or watched a play. After seeing previews and trailers for this movie, I became interested. Now I have to get my hands on the older movies.<br/><br/>I love plays and musicals, such as The Phantom of the Opera and Evita. I knew I would love this too and I did. 2 hrs was a perfect length of time to tell a complete story and trust me it doesn't feel as long once you get involved. You actually want to see what happens next. Like I said, I didn't know the story going into it, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I fell in love with it.<br/><br/>I also read what the cast had to go through to play convincing and genuine roles. That is a level of dedication that is so rarely done on film. It truly is an artwork and the actors/actresses are using their voices, talents and physical self to perform art. Its so rare to have a masterpiece put on screen.<br/><br/>Les Miserables was done so well that it seemed to flow seamlessly and for a second you forget that you're in a movie theater, or that you're seeing someone on screen that maybe played in another movie you know.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend you seeing it if you haven't already. Even if you aren't a big musical fan, you'll develop an appreciation of it after seeing this."
"someofusarebrave","9","2","3","26 December 2012"," great, director made mistakes but leads all did real well
","The women totally kicked ass in this movie. Anne Hathaway beat all my expectations to a bloody pulp; she is officially a rock star musically.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks was a revelation; I can't wait to see what she does next.<br/><br/>Whatever project is wise enough to cast her, I will be sure to see.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfreid was infinitely better than I expected her to be; her inexperience vocally totally worked for her here, adding to her character's believability as an innocent, cloistered teenager.<br/><br/>I wanted more development for Eponine's character, because just as in the musical, I found her to be the most relatable of all of the characters-certainly of all the female characters. The lack of extreme anguish in her character, the primarily silence of her suffering in a loud musical made it all the more poignant.<br/><br/>I was tremendously disappointed the director cut the latter half of 'Turning', as well as his choice to include the incestuous-seeming, terribly-worded 'Suddenly.' The only real note I have on this film is that the director seemed too inexperienced, certainly too unaware of the layers behind the female perspectives this script presents, to do his job at a beyond merely 'satisfactory' level. <br/><br/>Thanks to him, what should have felt like a revelation instead at times felt jolting and unnecessarily grim. This is a story about hope, not despair, and he seemed to linger in the bleakness with a troubling glee.<br/><br/>The choice to cast Russell Crowe rather than an older, stiff-upper-lip, snarling and sneering at the ""less moral"" from his perspective individual was..not wise. That's been said already. Russell Crowe seems like a genuinely good guy, real down-to-Earth; his character is among the most difficult in the movie, and the actor clearly got little help either from the script which should have been edited to portray the layers of contempt behind Javer's interactions with Val Jean when Val Jean was still Mayor, for example, to make it more clear that Javer suspected Val Jean all along but could not speak up about it, due to Javer's station being so much lower than Val Jean's as mayor was.<br/><br/>This, again, the director should have caught, as well as the simple fact that you cannot cast a novitiate, as The Phantom of the Opera's casting Gerard Butler in the titular role to flop reviews clearly evidenced to play a role that has been consistently offered only to the greats-with good reason. Russell Crowe was clearly trying, but receiving no help with his performance--it's not his fault he was miscast.<br/><br/>That choice I blame sorely on the director.<br/><br/>The choice to demand the actors speak lines which were originally intended to be sung was also a grave mistake, in my opinion. These lines rhymed--they made no sense as spoken lines. It seemed the director was just trying to include more dialogue in the movie for those who don't like musicals, but-it is a freakin' musical! They sing! Get over it.<br/><br/>I mean that for the director as well.<br/><br/>The choice to include 'Suddenly' was unfortunate. The director I suppose was trying to make his mark on the story, but the song came out all wrong for the script--too long, indicative of a romantic relationship between Cosette and Val Jean-ew!..awkwardly worded even for the romantic song it darn well seemed to be. A song filled with language like that belongs on a Britney Spears record, not in a musical.<br/><br/>Did I mention that Hugh Jackman did his job here perfectly? Cuz he did.<br/><br/>I can't imagine any other male acting in Hollywood today who could have performed this role better. Hats off."
"glennrockconner","9","2","3","26 December 2012"," Better than my great expectations.
","I saw ""Les Miserable"" at noon on Christmas Day with my wife & grown son in a movie theater where well-dressed waiters brought sparkling water to our seats to go along with our hummus and eggplant dip. It was a much better & pricier film venue than we usually patronize, but it seemed appropriate, given our extraordinarily high expectations for the film. And besides, it's near my brother's home, where we spent Christmas.<br/><br/>I did my homework preparing to see ""Les Mis"" critically, having spent dozens of hours singing along with various stage company soundtracks, and several thousand tickets at The Fabulous Fox over the last 20+ years. I downloaded the film's soundtrack a few days before Christmas, prompting a few snarky Facebook postings question Russell Crowe's contributions. I once even got a couple of hundred pages into an English translation of Victor Hugo's masterpiece (too many French names to keep up with, it turned out missed the music too much to read all the way through it). I read up a bit on France's June rebellion of 1832. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, several things about ""Les Mis"" exceeded my expectations. Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway were even better than I anticipated. Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne were especially outstanding. Colm Wilkinson was delightful as the Bishop of Dinge. Amanda Seyfried & Helen Bonham Carter were pleasant surprises. Sacha Baron Cohen surprised me by putting his own effective spin on Thenardier. Many, many others made their old familiar roles fresh & new.<br/><br/>My big shock was the success of Russell Crowe's performance. In the vacuum of the soundtrack, his voice seemed outclassed by his cast mates. On screen, however, his Javert was multidimensional & most satisfying. I've been a Russell Crowe fan since ""Gladiator,"" & I was excited when his casting was announced, but after hearing the soundtrack I identified two big mistakes in this film's production: Hiring Russell Crowe, & not firing him after his first day on the set. He made it work with his screen presence, though.<br/><br/>Not all the changes worked for me. Creative makeup designs tried to evoke the disease & the squalor of 19th century France, but came out alarmingly close to 21st century zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>All in all though, ""Les Mis"" is a winner. Les Mis devotees & musical theater aficionados have something new to love. If musical theater is your thing, this is your movie. If you are a musical theater neophyte & this film doesn't turn you on to the genre, don't waste any more money trying to catch the bug. This one's as good as it gets."
"mtbikemilo","9","2","3","26 December 2012"," Loved it!! But I LOVE Les Mis!
","I love Les Mis. When I say I love it, I mean I know every single measure of every single song by heart. That being said, I found the ""extra songs"" to be awkward and grating. (But I don't think you would pick up on it if you don't know every single word...) Hugh Jackman portrayed Valjean very expressively and completely transported the viewer into the moment; BUT the role of Valjean requires a very adept signing voice as those songs have a lot of depth to them, Mr. Jackman just doesn't have the voice required for the part. Same thing with Russel Crowe portraying Javert. Some of the most intense, touching parts of the music were lost to less than adequate singing ability. Anne Hathaway, stole the show no doubt... However, I was also pleasantly surprised by Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, she wasn't the best ever, but was well casted and delivered quite nicely. Eddy Redmayne was a phenomenal Marius and has a surprising voice. The one role (albeit a small role) that I can't believe no one is talking about is Samantha Barks as Eponine... Wow! Filling the shoes of Frances Ruffelle was a big task (I am very biased in this area as Ms. Ruffelle is my favorite and Eponine is my favorite character)but Ms. Barks was stunning!! Overall, I loved it because it is Les Mis and it was done better than I could have expected from Hollywood."

"pogue-565-289494","8","2","3","25 December 2012"," Agonizingly close
","It's too bad not all of the leads are great singers. And somebody should buy the director a tripod; the hand-held ultra closeups become dizzying and pretentious after awhile. (So many times, this movie cries out for an occasional wide shot. You know the famous wagon-pinning-the-citizen scene? We never even get to see the wagon. We start right with the closeup of the victim!)<br/><br/>But there's also a lot right with this version: inspired casting, rich visuals, and of course a brilliant score. Fascinating how certain themes and moments give ""Les Mis"" a different meaning when you have closeups (in this case, almost nothing BUT closeups) at your disposal. <br/><br/>Really glad we went. Would be gladder if the camera-work hadn't drawn so much attention to itself."
"willcutts-255-125785","9","2","3","25 December 2012"," Very well done
","I saw Les Miserables on Broadway many years ago - it was a stunning musical. Saw this movie tonight and was very impressed. Clearly, a compromise was made between singing and acting and, for the most part, I was happy with it. The cinematography and visual effects are great. The sets and costumes are great. The acting is great. The directing is very good - I do think some minor mistakes were made (would love to be able to ask the director about some of them). The vocals ranged from very good to disappointing.<br/><br/>I believe Russell Crowe as Javert was a mistake. While visually he is an appealing Javert, the vocals were too weak to justify this casting decision. Javert's final number was a great disappointment for me - a powerful song that Crowe could not deliver.<br/><br/>Other vocal pieces were also muted, but they were justified by magnificent acting performances that could not be achieved without compromising the vocals. These are interpretations I can live with, although I think many of the vocals from Marius were too high in tone (I think I would have cast him differently).<br/><br/>I thought the performances by Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks were outstanding. Strangely, I also particularly liked Colm Wilkerson as the Bishop.<br/><br/>All things considered, this an excellent production, and I highly recommend it."
"vitocavallo","8","2","3","25 December 2012"," Excellent - An honorable tribute to the musical
","After years of waiting, Les Mis the movie is here. Excellent tribute to the musical. I have seen musical twice. I am not going to explain the plot, just commenting on the technicals.<br/><br/>Great Points: Movie is long, seems to have all songs and some I don't remember from the musical and the cast soundtrack. The twists and turns of the plot were easier to follow than the musical. ( I have ADD) Hugh Jackman is perfect for Jean ValJean. It looks like he starved himself to shoot the opening scenes, then gained weight for the rest of the movie. Voice is great. Film showed the gritty of France's poor during this historical era. I guess they did not have to spend a lot of the budget on makeup or soap or hair dressers. Scenery was great as well, gritty and clean when it needed to be. Cinematography was lots of head shot of the singers with blurry background. kind of like an antique camera. Since it is a musical, it worked. Sacha and Helen Bonham were very good as the innkeeper and wife, but I was expecting a little more comedy relief. Also, Sacha started with French accent at beginning but ended up with a Cockney accent at the end of the film. I liked Anne Hathaway's solo, lots of emotion and very good voice. I know she has received a lot of bad press on her performance.<br/><br/>Not so good points: I love Russell and he is a respected character in many movies, but I could not accept him singing. I kept seeing him as Gladiator or Capt. Aubrey. He did ride a horse like a pro.<br/><br/>Movie is long, so see with empty bladder.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it as well as I did."
"HEFILM","5","10","28","20 December 2012"," Poorly directed frequently out of focus approach is distracting
","This movie makes history as being the musical with the most out of focus shots on record.<br/><br/>The trailers for this film are careful to present the visual style of the film as looking as big and classical(David LEANish) as they can. What they are hiding is almost a Blair Witch like style that director Hooper uses. <br/><br/>Most of the film, when it doesn't involve some CGI work, is shot with a very unstable and frequently out of focus in large or very large closeup with the actors staring into the shaky camera while it goes it and out of focus randomly. Anne Hathaway's big solo runs as one long take this way, it's completely distracting and for a movie that runs this long to have the same approach to every scene is dull. Hooper also, as he did in the better-overall THE KING'S SPEECH, also will put an actor way off in the lower corner and/or against the edge of a the frame making you stare at at wall or dead or out of focus background and have to force yourself to watch the performer while your eye keeps getting drawn off of them to the majority of the frame that is meaningless. He also in ED WOOD like fashion will cut to wide shots when you least expect them only to have someone eventually come into the frame. It's like he's interesting in anything but what's currently going on. The movie is mostly very well sung and acted, with the only problem being that Jackman's upper register of his voice gets very pinched and nasally. He gives a good performance but the music isn't written for his best tones and it falls way short of the excellent singing of ""23601's in the recent Broadway revival. Another thing that makes these closeups off putting is the overly dirty faces and teeth or almost everyone. One the big screen the fake grunge on each tooth is as big as your TV at home you can't help but go, ""Wow their breath must stink.""<br/><br/>Hooper really almost ruins the film with his approach, he has no feel for an epic and sometimes doesn't seem to know how to cover action of the scene or of the overall story. The opening with the gang of prisoners trying to pull the boat into dry dock is a good example. The scene and song goes on and on the boat never seems to move then suddenly we cut and it's later and the boat is in place already. Wasn't the scene about them pulling in the boat? Why just skip that part.<br/><br/>Les Miserables was not a big dancing type musical but there's even less of that here. The film's approach to everyone singing live is the one good idea Hooper has but he even sort of spoils that in the big final number where it's clear they aren't singing live. He has a massive scene of everyone singing but also, as he does, cuts almost randomly to giant close ups and we don't hear that characters voice at all,only still the whole chorus instead. For a musical the editing has no sense of timing certainly it rarely cuts on the beat. Additionally each music number feels like it's waiting for applause as it just turns silent and then lingers on the otherwise over scene. You almost feel a stage-like ""time to move all the scenery around"" In many other moments the music will swell to some huge dramatic climax of moment and the camera will lazily be one some random close up of some extra or unimportant detail.<br/><br/>Don't sit up close in the film or, like BLAIR WITCH, you're likely to get motion sickness and end up rubbing your eyes from the strain of fighting against the out of focus approach. Don't get me wrong here BLAIR WITCH used this approach and it worked for rather than against the material. It also works great in the BOURNE movies. But it takes skill to time your shaky camera and ""bad"" framing in a way that it propels the film and the editors/cameraman/ and director don't have that level of skill to make it work here.<br/><br/>One more thing of interest and a first is that the MASTER OF THE HOUSE number as sung by BORAT/COHEN is sung with a french accent and is quite funny. The rest of the time however that character and many others speak in a low English accent--which is true to the stage version--but of course makes no sense as the whole story is set and about pure French people. An odd thing. On stage you just sort of buy it but as a film being much more obviously in real world... Several of ""The Master's"" songs from the show are cut from the film version.<br/><br/>Although the film does show a number of blacks(I won't say African Americans because this is France) realistically mixed into the crowd scenes, but a major supporting role, always sung by a person of color in the stage show, is given to yet another Brit White Gal. Odd. Especially as there are plenty of great black actress singers who could have played and sung the role.<br/><br/>Hooper Hooper, what were you thinking? It's nice to have new approaches to material but this one doesn't work and it should be about expressing the material not reminding the audience that this director's vision is always there by shaking around being just a bit out of sync with the actor's movements and drifting in and just as often out of focus.<br/><br/>Notice, just as a final focus problem, all of the end credits are nice and sharp until the credit roll starts and then all then are out of focus because the font and speed of the roll is too much.<br/><br/>The whole thing on that level just speaks to inexperience. Hard to believe but true."

"timcon1964","9","1","1","23 February 2020"," Film Provides Visual Context for this Famous Musical
","Given the length of Hugo's novel (over 1,400 pages in some editions), a definitive screen version would have to be 15 to 20 hours long. This film, based on the musical, preserves most of Hugo's story, actually adding scenes that could not appear in the musical (some employing computer-generated imagery), such as the elephant statue where Gavroche hides out, General Lamarque's funeral procession, and Valjean's trip through the Paris sewers, and presents modified versions of scenes taken from the musical, such as the deaths of Eponine and Valjean.<br/><br/>A few characters, e.g., Petit Gervais, Felix Tholomyes, Fauchlevent, and Mabeuf, are absent. Marius' grandfather Gillenormand puts in brief appearances to hint at Marius' family background. But Marius' father George Pontmercy is omitted, as are M. Thenardier's encounter with George at Waterloo, and Marius' troubled relationship with his father. But the Thenardier family (the inspiration for the title, ""Les Miserables""), which has disappeared entirely from some adaptations of Hugo's novel, does appear in this film.<br/><br/>One virtue of the musical is that it rescues Thenardier's daughter Eponine from the oblivion into which some versions have cast her. But it dwells almost entirely on her unrequited love for Marius; this is only half of Eponine's story. In the novel, although jealous of Cosette, who is obviously the object of Marius' romantic interest, Eponine guides Marius to Cosette's house, but only after hesitating, biting her lip, and ""going through a kind of internal struggle."" As she explains her decision, ""Who cares, it makes no difference. You look sad, I want you to be glad."" Thus, Eponine strives to make Marius happy, even though she knows she can never be part of his life. As she is leading Marius to Cosette's house, Eponine admonishes him, ""You're following me too closely, Monsieur Marius. . . . It won't do for a fine young man like you to be seen with a woman like me."" Her jealousy of Cosette occasionally emerges, especially after she sees Marius enter Cosette's garden, and sits in the shadows muttering ""sullen and threatening"" comments. Then her father's gang appears, planning to kidnap Cosette and demand ransom from Valjean. If she wishes for retribution, Eponine can merely stand back and let the gang implement its plan, instead she overcomes her jealousy and risks her life to protect Cosette and Marius. The film shows this scene, without showing Eponine's mixed feelings or the real danger posed by the gang (in the novel it consists of six heavily armed thugs).<br/><br/>In the film, Eponine intercepts Cosette's note to Marius, reads it, and keeps it from him; consequently, Marius, desperate because of Cosette's unexplained disappearance, goes to the barricade. But even if he had received Cosette's note, Marius probably would have gone to the barricade after finding his access to Cosette barred by Valjean. In Hugo's novel, Cosette hands her note to Eponine (then disguised as a boy); and Eponine never reads it. Nor does she destroy it. This film may be the only one that follows the novel in showing how Eponine dies by deliberately taking the bullet intended for Marius. As she is dying, she gives Marius Cosette's note, and tells him that she had not wanted him to receive it. But if so, why did she not destroy it? What will she do with the note except give it to Marius? In Hugo's novel, after reading the note, Marius writes a ""farewell"" message to Cosette, making no mention of Cosette's note or her disappearance. Instead, he tells Cosette that he cannot marry her or follow her to England because his grandfather has disapproved of their marriage and .won't provide Marius with the needed money. This would not have mattered except that Marius has no money of his own because he found legal work boring and deliberately chose to be poor, ""curtailing labor to give (time) to thought."" Thus, Marius, and not Eponine or his grandfather, is really the author of his own misfortune. If Eponine's romantic aspirations are frustrated, her life invalidates Marius' assumption that there is nothing in the world for a woman like her, ""neither liberty, nor virtue, nor responsibility."" Love makes Valjean possessive, and Marius insensitive. It has the opposite effect on Eponine. She is the hero of the middle chapters.<br/><br/>The film devotes a half an hour to events at the barricade, in which the rebels exchange fire with army troops before succumbing to their superior numbers. Thereafter, it adheres fairly closely to the novel, following Valjean through the sewers, witnessing Javert's suicide, and Marius' reunion with his grandfather and his reconciliation with Valjean. In the final scene, Fantine escorts Valjean to heaven where he is greeted by the Bishop of Digne, who had tried to make a good man of Valjean many years earlier.<br/><br/>The cast is strong. Hugh Jackman is perhaps the best Valjean, and.Russell Crowe is convincing as Javert. But Anne Hathaway's performance as Fantine is arguably the best in the film. For the role of Cosette, director Tom Hooper wanted someone who could project ""tremendous intelligence,"" and selected Amanda Seyfried-he may have been seeking a portrayal in which Cosette's restraint reflected her sheltered life and convent education. (In an alternative approach Ellie Bamber's performance in the 2018 BBC version stressed Cosette's exuberance as a person excitedly entering into womanhood, Paris life, and romantic expectations.) Eddie Redmayne effectively portrays Marius' mood swings; and Aaron Tveit puts in a strong performance as Enjolras, leader of the student rebels. Because the film, like the musical, introduces M. Thenardier (Sacha Cohen) and Mme. Thenardier (Helena Bonham Carter) as rather clownish buffoons (in a tasteless sequence that adds nothing to the story) their subsequent attempts to appear sinister lack credibility. Samantha Barks, having played Eponine on stage in Queen's Theatre (London), in the 25th Anniversary Concert, and now in this movie, is probably more associated with this role than any other actor (Hooper says she is ""really very, very special""). And there are effective performances by two young actors: 11-year-old Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche), and 10-year-old Isabelle Allen (young Cosette). The acting required serious personal commitments. Jackman lost 30 pounds and engaged in daily 3-hour weightlifting sessions. Almost unbelievably, Hathaway lost 25 pounds, and allowed her real hair to be cut. Barks also lost weight.<br/><br/>The initial draft of the screenplay called for spoken dialogue to be interspersed with the musical numbers. But Hooper chose to have almost the entire performance sung. He worried that ""constant gear shifts between dialog and music . . . (would be) like two different orders of realism,"" in which singing might seem ""less naturalistic than spoken dialog."" Presenting everything in song, he felt, would ""honor the musical itself."" Most filmed musicals reject this approach.<br/><br/>The singing is mostly good. Singing into a camera is naturally more subdued than singing on a concert stage. Hathaway's rendition of ""Dream"" makes up in emotional impact what it lacks in volume. The same can be said of Redmayne's singing of ""Empty Chairs."" Jackman has a surprisingly powerful voice (though sometimes with distracting vibrato). But Crowe often fails to sustain notes, and sometimes sounds like a patient with emphysema. Apparently, some of Jackman's songs were transposed down by as much as a third. This could have been done with some of Crowe's songs-he does noticeably better when in his comfort range (e.g., his performance of ""Stars""). Seyfried's singing voice seems to be rather weak-Katie Hall (Cosette in the 25th Anniversary Concert) who has a strong voice, actually appears in this film in a very minor role; one wonders if she auditioned for the role of Cosette in this film.) Viewers should bear in mind that actors sang some songs as many as 20 or more times. Barks, whose singing is among the best in the film, had to sing under a rain machine that left her shaking and her teeth chattering (when she dried out, the filming crew doused her with more water!).<br/><br/>Awards reflect the high regard in which this film is held. Wikipedia, summarizing the actions of 24 organizations, reports that Les Miserables received 66 nominations and 32 awards. Individual awards went to Hathaway (she received 11), Jackman, Barks, and Isabelle Allen, and there were other awards, including one for cast as a whole.<br/><br/>The film offers optional English, French, and Spanish subtitles, and DVS (Digital Video Service)-audio description of unfolding events for the vision impaired. Extras include (1) ""Stars of Les Miserables"" (approximately 11 minutes): Director Tom Hooper and cast members discuss casting, and interpretation of characters.

","As a huge fan of the original stage production of Les Miserables, all I can say about this movie is the following: if you are looking for all the beautiful music of Les Miserables, don't bother with this film. The singing is far from terrible, but it's also far from the highlight of the film. You could get far better performances from any stage available stage adaptation of the musical. However, if you are looking for the most powerful dramatic adaptation of the stage play, this movie is the definitive version of the musical. Ignoring the singing, the performances of nearly every actor in this film convey the dramatic tension, sorrow and raw emotion of the original story on a level that is unparalleled by any stage or film adaptation. The darkness, grit and desperation of the original story shine through magnificently. The medium of film gives this story the sort of rough and dark mood that none of the pristine and clean stage productions I've seen could ever hope to replicate. When you hear the soundtrack, the performances are far from the best musically speaking, yet the emotion and tone stand out greater than any other performance. Characters choking on tears and soberly contemplating the painful path on which they've been set may not sound beautiful, but its the raw imperfections of each performance that give way to the dramatic aspects of the production. The only real shame about this adaption in my eyes is that so many critics and viewers lambasted the performances for their lack of a clean and pretty musical quality, when it is the raw rough and dirty nature of those performances that makes this adaptation as powerful as it is."

","I don't why no one told me about this movie. I love movies with a beautiful cinematography and this is one of them. <br/><br/>So I had a spontaneous experience. I had no idea they would be singing. It sounded ridiculous for a few seconds but then I understood the tone, and there's so much energy in this movie I wanted to behead some kings then. <br/><br/>The music is just awesome. It's still in my head. It's really powerful, because it's enhanced by a really clever staging. The first scene with the boy is a pure joy. I was surprised to see all these actors I knew singing perfectly well. <br/><br/>The cast is unbelievable - Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Eddie Redmayne, Anne Hataway...and my favorite, Helena Bonham Carter which is incredible in its grotesque character, you can tell the same king of vilainy from her character Bellatrix in Harry Potter. There is a lot of astounding scenes, and Bellatrix and his husband stealing choregraphy is one of them.
It's not about choosing popular actors though. I think they perfectly fit the story and the tone, especially Jackman and Carter. 
Redmayne choice is kind of weird, because he's really soft, as a leader of Revolution, but maybe that's the point ? <br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is so ambitious, the staging is epic, like the cortege scenes in exterior. Interesting cinematography because a lot of wide angles lenses were used, even in some dialogs and close-ups, to enhance the grotesque of French poverty, diseases, and mischief that emerges from the hobble life conditions. But the higher class takes its toll too, thanks to the Revolution and the powerful songs. Everything is described with a harsh eye. And yet it's aesthetically neat and enjoyable. <br/><br/>My only cons: 
I don't like the theatrical tone much, especially when everyone wants to die for no reason. Dying from love ? I just don't buy it. The most ridiculous death is Crowe suiciding because...being in debt of a thief ? Come on. <br/><br/>It lasts more than 2 hours but I wish there were more.

Financially this film has been a great success, I just wish they had worked harder to make the most of what a cinematic version might offer and it could have been another Oliver or West Side Story, but sadly it's not. So few musicals appear to work to fully utilise the medium of film and this one fails on many counts. 1. if your actors can't sing, don't force them to perfom long and avoidable solos! Poor Hugh Jackman did his best, but even an actor of his calibre can't compensate for such a long and unflattering spotlight. 2.Intersperse the songs with other stuff! 10 minutes of action does not mean the next 40 minuites can be overlooked. 3.Give people rousing choruses that they can sing along to. This film almost managed it, but felt the need to change track every time it got close. 4.You don't need to get your actors to sing every single bit of dialog. I think someone cottoned on to this about 3/4 of the way through, but then thought better of it. As it stands, this version is about an hour too long. i just hope its scale doesn't put anyone off from making another musical version some time in the future as it could be so much better than this."
"neazy","7","1","1","30 November 2017"," Rough Diamond
","This is a very difficult film to assess. It has significant flaws, but on reflection I believe this to be principally down to the difficulties of translating this musical into a film. To begin with, I was seriously underwhelmed - the opening sequences seemed overblown and melodramatic, and the storytelling rather clumsy, particularly in its knitting together of scenes. As the film progressed, however, I began to realise that these faults were actually fairly similar to the faults with the musical itself - I have always found the opening scenes, with their hyperactive drama compensating for rushed narrative, to be the weakest of the show. Having accepted this, I relaxed and began to appreciate what was being done. In many ways this is a remarkable piece of work. Visually, it is utterly stunning, be it set design, costume or cinematography. The big numbers are superbly rendered in a broader space than is available on stage, giving a real sense of scale and weight to the production. Most importantly, it retains the emotional tug of the musical. I honestly wasn't expecting it, but as the old familiar songs emerged I felt myself drawn further and further into the story, as I have always felt in the theatre, and come the ending, as usual, I was a blubbering wreck. I had expected a polished effort, but I had not expected the film to so fully engage me. To make an audience feel is a powerful skill, and it was used to full advantage here.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I cannot really give the film top marks. Whilst I accepted the flaws of the opening, it was still disappointing that no solution had been attempted. I was also rather horrified by Hugh Jackman's remarkable changes of accent - in the first quarter of an hour he cycled indiscriminately through Irish, Australian, American, and several of the major British regional dialects. Once he settled, he was a passable Valjean - his voice matured through the film, and his acting was solid. Eddie Redmayne gave a surprisingly fine performance as Marius, and many of the minor characters were well played. I was, however, disappointed with some of the casting. The principal voices, overall, were a mixed bag. Whilst I wasn't myself a fan of Anne Hathaway's Fantine, despite its widespread admiration, I could accept its objective merits. Russell Crowe is seriously miscast as Javert, lacking menace, and with a voice entirely ill- suited to its purpose. Not his fault, just a bad casting decision. The Tenardiers, too were a disappointment - Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter are fine actors, but they played their roles far too much down the kooky path for my liking - weirdness for weirdness' sake, without the genuinely slimy charm and wit the roles deserve.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film will remain a fond memory for me, and will get a rewatch one day - anything that can invoke such deep emotion has a true spark of genius in it, despite its flaws."

","Wow, just wow. I didn't expect much coming into this movie, though I am an avid lover of musicals. The French Revolution just didn't appeal that much to me, but two hours later when the credits were rolling down the screen and tears were rolling down my face, I realized how wrong I was.<br/><br/>Les Misérables is a movie based off a musical based off a book, and there's a reason this story has so many adaptations. It's a romantic tale with many thoroughly developed characters and story lines all woven together with music. Oh man, I've listened to the soundtrack a countless number of times already.<br/><br/>The actors are perfect in their imperfections. Since the songs were sung while filming rather than lip-syncing, they are able to convey more emotion, and emotion certainly is the one word that comes to mind when I think of this movie. Anne Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is especially heart-wrenching and gave Hathaway a deserved Oscar. <br/><br/>Just--it's good. It's really good.

","""Can you hear the people sing?"" Audiences can hear the people sing...but at times, they may not want to. Adapted from Victor Hugo's novel and the musical of the same name, Les Misérables, or Les Mis, sings loud and clear with its star-studded cast, all while exploring themes of righteousness, redemption, love, and forgiveness.<br/><br/>Les Misérables stars Hugh Jackman, supported by Oscar winners Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, and Eddie Redmayne. Set in France, this musical drama begins in 1815 and spans nearly twenty years over the course of its two and a half hour run time. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is released from prison, but is put on parole for the remainder of his life. Because of his criminal record, he struggles to obtain a job, shelter, or good reputation, and decides to make a new start, destroying his parole papers and going into hiding. Eight years later, Valjean has become mayor of a small town and a factory owner, but is shocked to cross paths with his old parole officer, Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe). Seeking to live a godly life, Valjean provides care for his former employee (Anne Hathaway) and her daughter (Amanda Seyfried), all while running from his past.<br/><br/>Les Misérables is a true form musical; nearly the entire film is sung. While this makes for a unique film experience, muffled lines and the complete lack of spoken dialogue can oftentimes cause confusion regarding plot details. The music takes advantage of the leitmotif technique, giving each character a short ""theme"" that they sing recurringly. Each theme is linked with its character and creates an identifiable musical identity.<br/><br/>The film focuses on character, using their lyrics and leitmotifs to show viewers the thoughts and feelings of each character. The characters were well rounded and developed nicely. Although singing to express emotions is a straightforward way to develop characters, it is incredibly effective at allowing these characters to become relatable. For instance, when a character sings ""I love him,"" audiences immediately know the mood and feelings of that character, and can focus on how that character's actions, expressions, and words relate to that phrase. Jean Valjean, the protagonist, is somewhat of a tragic hero. Although he does not experience a transition from good to evil, he experiences relatable emotions (fear, sadness, love) and tragedies (imprisonment, loss of loved ones, running from the law).<br/><br/>The music is the centerpiece in the film, but it never quite hits the mark. The beautiful accompaniment is often hidden beneath sound effects and vocals, and the singing itself was often breathy and out of tune (although to the actors' credit, the music was sung live during filming, not recorded in a sound studio). The sets and costumes were the true showstoppers, elaborate, well- made, and giving the film a realism that it could have never achieved as a stage musical. ​ ​The cinematography contained a few unique angles and shot selections that contributed to the musical nature of the film. Oftentimes, the singers stared either directly or indirectly into the camera, as if they were singing to the audience (not unusual on a stage, but an odd choice for a film adaptation). There were also many wide shots and aerial views of Paris, which would normally be an impossibility in a stage performance.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film's acting, score, and set design were exquisite, but the poor singing scattered throughout proved to be a major distraction.​ The film (PG-13) requires a mature audience; it contains some suggestive material, but also explores deep themes beyond the grasp of most young viewers. Despite the scope and effort behind the film, Les Miserables can't quite reach the high note it strains to achieve."

","This is the one of musical movies. Some people don't like musical movies, but actually, I like that. Some people says singing suddenly is very strange and I agree with that, but I don't care about that so much because the songs characters sing shows their feeling so well. In this movie, all dialog is in songs, so it's a little bit different than usual musical movies. One thing I want to say is the way to shoot this movie is very fantastic! When people shoot musical movies, before the shooting starts actors record songs and they move their mouth without singing when they shoot. But this movie takes different way. Actors put ear monitor on and sing with listening only piano. Actors sing the way they want to sing, so they can act and sing very naturally. So actors in this movies have great and wonderful skills. This movie shows a view of the Les Miserables world so well. We can enjoy everything about Les Miserables same as the play."

","The adaptation of literary works into a film, often controversial.

One important reason for this is because the class nature of literary works often because of its popularity, after the film is difficult to meet the standards for everyone, also caused the controversy of the situation.As a masterpiece in the history of literature, ""les miserables"" has 19 film, but no one is really widely recognized. In addition to the film, the ""tragic world"" in the form of musical has been widely spread.

"Manya086","9","1","1","7 November 2015"," From Broadway to the Big Screen
","Let me start by saying, I have not seen the Broadway musical for Les Miserables nor have I read the book. My only reference to the songs were from the 25th Anniversary Concert videos on YouTube. The only adaptation I have seen was 1998's Les Miserables with Liam Neeson. Tom Hooper's version of LES MISERABLES is my favorite adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel. <br/><br/>Tom Hooper chose to have the actors sing live while filming other than prerecording the songs for playback (as they usually do in musicals). This was a great choice, leaving the actors freedom to act (or in this case sing) with emotion as they see fit. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Fantine is phenomenal! The preparations she took, like losing some weight when her character was starving and actually cutting off all her hair when she could have worn a wig. Her performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is heartbreaking. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Jean Valjean is equally phenomenal. He looked completely unrecognizable in the beginning of the film with his dramatic weight loss. I was surprised by the fact that he can really sing! Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen performances are amazing and the roles really suit them. Eddie Redmayne's portray of Marius is great, he really gave emotion to ""Empty Chairs At Empty Tables."" Samantha Barks is perfectly cast as Eponine, her performance of ""On My Own"" is flawless.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the great performances of the cast, but here are some things that lacked. I felt that Russell Crowe as Javert didn't perform to the level the other actors did. Though his performance with Hugh Jackman in ""The Confrontation"" was great, his performance of ""Stars"" was a bit weak. Amanda Seyfried's portrayal of Cosette was also a bit weak compared to the others. It felt like her singing was drowned out by the other actors in songs like ""Heart Full of Love"" and ""One Day More."" Both Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried did great in the film, but their singing could have been improved. Also, Eponine and Marius' ""A Little Fall of Rain"" is cut too short, it would have been nice had it been a bit longer. The ending scene where Jean Valjean is dying and is greeted by Fantine's spirit is beautifully done.<br/><br/>Overall, LES MISERABLES is an amazing film full of great songs and powerful performances. This is a great film for people who have not seen the Broadway musical or even if you have. Tom Hooper's LES MISERABLES is exactly how I envision the Broadway musical would be. I must warn you, most of the film is singing with very little speaking words, this may not be for everybody. But it is loaded with amazing songs, you may not care. I recommend seeing this film and have tissues at the ready!"

","Les Miserables is a movie set in 19th-century France about a man, Jean Valjean, who agrees to raise a factory worker's daughter. It's based on the musical of the same name which is in turn based on the 1862 French novel by Victor Hugo. It stars an ensemble cast led by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>All the actors deliver an excellent performance, both acting and singing, especially Hathaway. But the movie felt unnecessarily long, especially all the singed monologues. The diagonal camera angle and extreme close ups were a bit distracting.<br/><br/>There were parts that didn't make sense. For example, why did Fantine bring an incriminating letter to work for no reason? Or how did Marius and Cosette fall in love so quickly? There's another one that I can't mention without spoiling the movie, but it's in the first act.<br/><br/>It would've been nice to see the plot drive the movie instead of the music driving the whole movie.

Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as Fantine - the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments, and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.<br/><br/>HATS OFF TO ALL!!!"
"bbewnylorac","6","1","1","21 March 2015"," Not great
","Part of the trouble with Les Mis is trying to sum up the entire French Revolution in a musical, which is a strange, even absurd idea. I still prefer the stage version - it has less pretension that this is realistic. As others have said, the CGI in the movie is over-done. The songs and characters don't need over the top design and effects - it's as if the producers felt they had to throw money at each scene and crowd the screen with people and buildings and objects. The Thenardiers' comic Master of the House, for example, was overly elaborate, whereas the lyrics and the couple alone are amusing enough without so many pranks. The casting is uneven. I am not a fan of Hugh Jackman, but he can sing, if not beautifully, and Jean Valjean would have been hard to cast. Anne Hathaway is OK as Fantine but it's a rather pathetic character and not a great stretch for her. Amanda Seyfried is a bit shrill as the older Cosette but again has a bit of a pathetic role. Eddie Redmayne is wonderful as Marius. Not the conventional hunk, but a lovely singer with a good strong screen presence. The other male rebels have those gorgeous rich voices required of all those revolutionary songs. The children playing young Cosette and Gavroche are great. The woman playing the older Eponine has a nice voice and her songs are done well. But she's not convincing in her death scene. Too healthy looking. The technique of the actors singing live is a stroke of genius. Witness brilliant songs like Do You Hear the People Sing or Red and Black and Drink With Me. They're lush and fresh. I had heard that Russell Crowe can't sing but that rumour was wrong. He's not Pavarotti but he acquits himself well in a demanding role as Valjean's nemesis, Javert. The barricade scenes take a while to pick up. They stop and start too much. Les Mis is a hard movie to film, but I felt it could have been done much better."

","For fans of the musical, it is spellbinding to watch Les Miserables finally come to life on the big screen. However, for the typical movie goer or even a fan in retrospect, it's clear that the movie doesn't know quite what it wants to be. It's a mess of gloomy, gritty sequences mixed with animated, silly, or downright ridiculous imagery. Although there are some great voices, the majority of the film consists of terrible singers, which feels so out of place with all of the great instrumental. Mix in some awkward, unbelievable CGI long shots and strange, uncomfortable camera angles, and now we have the Les Mis movie, and we aren't going to get a new one any time soon. However, the film is better than most of the movie musicals that we get. And, at the end of the day, Les Mis is like pizza. Even when it's done poorly, it's still pretty good."

Eventually, after 19 years in prison he is finally released on parole. Unable to find a job he steals from a church but is once again caught.

Ashamed for his actions he decides to start a new life and tears up his parole papers as a sign of his determination.

Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that it follows the book quite faithfully. That said it's rather long (158 minutes) and a large portion of it is performed in song. A very large portion. Even so most of it was quite entertaining and I recommend it to those who enjoy musicals of this type. Above average."

Also, there was a lot of in-your-face hand-held camera-work, and that got old pretty quickly.<br/><br/>That said, I can wholeheartedly appreciate the skill herein on a technical level. Hugh Jackman felt right at home with the singing, and his voice is admirable. Crowe's no slouch, either.

","In my humble opinion, this is quite simply the greatest musical ever made. It not my favourite, that honour goes to the Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton movie 'The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas' but this is a beer movie. I love it. Everything about this movie is perfect.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: After breaking the rules of his parole, ex-convict Jean Valjean, becomes mayor of a town and a factory owner, whilst staying one step ahead of Police Inspector Javert. One of the factory workers, Fantine, blames him for her being cast into a life of prostitution. He feels responsible and agrees to take care of her daughter, Cosette. Later they are swept up in the Paris Uprising of 1832.<br/><br/>I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Hugh Jackman is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. To put it bluntly, no actor could have done a better job than Hackman in playing Jean Valjean. As good as Daniel Day Lewis was in 'Lincoln' I think Hackman should have got the Oscar for Best Actor that year. One who did get the Oscar she deserved was Anne Hathaway for her performance of Fantine<br/><br/>Russell Crowe who I'm not a fan of, is excellent as Javert. Helena Bonham Carter is perfectly cast as Madame Thénardier, whilst Sasha Baron Cohen is a lot of fun as her husband ""The Master Of The House"" Eddie Redmayne is superb as Marius. His performance of ""Empty Seats At Empty Tables"" is nothing short of breathtaking. Aaron Tveit gives a sterling performance as Enjolras, whilst Daniel Huttlestone is a scene stealing Gavroche, who just about steals the film. Huttlestone would have stolen the full movie if were not for Samantha Barks stunning portrayal of Éponine.<br/><br/>Barks plays Éponine with such sweetness, grace, and sadness that it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role, she is heartbreakingly beautiful. Her hauntingly beautiful performance of ""On My Own"" is my favourite of the full movie. And that is saying something as it is filled with songs both beautiful and catchy. I could spend another five paragraphs singing the praises of Barks. But I'll stop here. I'll definitely be looking out for her in the future. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.<br/><br/>A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. And believe me this movie will stay with you long after the finale.<br/><br/>Les Miserables grossed $148 million at the domestic box office, to end 2012 as the 18th highest grossing movie of the year."

","Coming from a Broadway background, I was super excited to see Les Miserables! I saw it in theaters twice (once at the midnight premiere in my city and again with my friends), and overall loved it!<br/><br/>There's always a ""but"", though. Casting, in my opinion, is what cost the Oscar for this movie. Russell Crowe looked scared and sounded like he had nasal issue; he did not meet the expectations of the masculine Javert, which is why I felt a little relief during ""Javert's Suicide"". Amanda Seyfried was innocent, like Cosette is supposed to be, but her voice was too small. Hugh Jackman would've made a great Javert, and really brought a grand perspective to Jean Valjean.<br/><br/>The make-up and costuming was outstanding and really brought out contrast between rich and poor; sick and healthy. And all the death scenes were well produced (Fantine's Death, Little People or Gavroche's Death, A Little Fall of Rain or Eponine's death, the Final Battle Scene). Overall, it was true to the story and is really worth seeing 9/10"

I liked Samantha Barks more than Amanda Seyfried and I think she acts better as a Miserable. I'm like her too I guess. But beside all that Eponine-stuff this movie is a masterpiece in my opinion.

","I had no desire at all to watch this film, even after countless trailers and clips I watch of the film. My drive went from zero to a minus ha. However, I thought to myself, I'm setting up a Movie Blog I need to expand my horizons a bit and watch films I wouldn't usually watch. So here is my review for the film in my heart I knew I would despise.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper usually makes films that do not peak my interest, they are very much award orientated films and that's just not me.<br/><br/>The film revolves around an ex-convict known Jean Valjean (Jackman) as he tries to reinvent his life after he is convicted with petty theft, now trying to become a very model citizen. No matter how hard he may try, Inspector Javert (Crowe) a very dedicated lawman who will take down his man no matter how well his life has turned around.<br/><br/>Valjean's life is now better than he probably ever expected, he's now a very wealthy man, mayor of his town and Javert accidentally comes across him, both mean realising who the other is setting up a long and arduous chase by Javert to catch his man. Even if that means decades of chasing and hunting him throughout a student uprising resulting in pretty severe war time.<br/><br/>The film is acted beautifully by the entire cast and I usually shy away from praising an entire cast, however I can't say anybody in this film gave a less than stellar performance. Jackman portrays a very wounded and pain driven man, his best acting performance to date.<br/><br/>Overall, I can HIGHLY recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of this kind of film, it may be long but there is no point in which you're thinking about time. However, you will definitely need a toilet break at some point. My favourite performance from the entire film came from unknown Samantha Barks playing Eponin, she was a revelation, hope she goes onto much bigger things."

","I have seen Les Mis live on a couple of occasions so I knew the movie was not going to be an opera on the big screen. Using opera stars would have made it a big screen opera and it would have bombed since it offered nothing new. I also doubt that opera stars would have been able to handle the rigors these actors went through while carrying a tune...in my opinion. These actors brought the characters to life in ways no one else could. They showed the trials endured during this time period better than any book I have ever read. The singing parts ranged from good to excellent and I am impressed they were able to both sing and act their parts. I have seen it three times and the songs are still in my head they were so moving. Once you realize it's not Wolverine singing you get a 9 star rating for cast and story! I also suggest watching it with the closed captions on at least once. I missed a bit of the lyrics the first time around."
"carolinefhendries","6","1","1","12 August 2014"," Male leads aren't strong enough to carry musical adaptation.
","I have long been a fan of Les Miserables and appreciate that it is a long and heavy story to adapt into a screenplay. Most of the film versions I have seen haven't come close to the stage production or the book. But I was looking forward to a musical adaptation although was unsure how this would transfer to the big screen. Therefore I delayed watching it until I caught it on Sky the other night and concluded that my reservations were right.<br/><br/>Whilst I applaud the director for insisting the actors sing live, I think the film fails from the moment Hollywood stars were cast. If you are going to adapt one of the most famous shows of all time then use trained singers. The choice of Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman were poor since neither of these actors can sing well enough to carry the film. Anne Hathaway, as everyone has said, is excellent, but she is only on screen for a short part of the film. This story rests on strength of the two male characters and, whilst they are both good actors in their own right, their vocal range are not. So either the director should have just adapted this as a straightforward film using Hollywood actors to do what they do best and act. Or he should have used existing members of the stage show who can then deliver the songs properly. I can't help but feel that the studio were more concerned about making money and so cast two famous Hollywood stars in the lead, without thinking that quality singing is expected. What a pity because the actual visuals and story telling were not bad. I give this a generous 6 out of 10 and would recommend people go and see the stage production or read the book instead."

","Les Misérables is a heart-felt story about an escaped convict during the French Democratic Revolution. Jean Valjean, the escaped convict played by Hugh Jackman, sang soulfully about his struggles but also triumphantly how he turned his life around. When he gave his soul to God, he vowed that he had a duty to be a better person and to serve others. The character was well-played by Jackman because his appeal was infectious. Other characters in the movie, such as Fantine played by Anne Hathaway, touched many hearts in the audience. Through loud sobs and gasps, Hathaway sang the famed ""I Dreamed a Dream"" with as much despair and as much feeling as she could. Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, and Amanda Seyfried, also prominent figures in the movie, represented the hardships of love. Barks was a third wheel in the love triangle between Seyfried, Redmayne, and Barks. When Barks's character Éponine sings her iconic song ""On My Own,"" audience members can empathize and relate to her story, and that's what makes her character a protagonist. Lastly, the Revolution was portrayed as a momentous struggle for freedom of democracy, and it really captured the historical essence of the complication. Not all of the big names in the film did a fantastic job singing-wise, but the acting and portrayal of the characters was beyond outstanding. Even to someone who doesn't like musicals, the songs in Les Misérables are catchy and emotion-filled."

","The 2012 version of Les Miserables is a dark, rather depressing take on Victor Hugo's classic, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's full of immense talent and the majority of these actors surprised me because they actually know how to sing. This film will make even the toughest cry just a little, because this is such an emotional story. This is a near-classic that surpasses the last adaptation of Les Miserables in every way.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper directs a musical based on the events that took place during the French Revolution of 1848. This is a battle between good vs. the law and more specifically Jean Valijean vs. Javert. Valijean, who served 19 years for stealing bread and skipped parole, is on the run from Javert who believes nothing upholds the law.<br/><br/>The acting is utterly fantastic in this film. This movie couldn't have been made with lesser acting. Anne Hathaway is fantastic and really gives me the chills during her rendition, ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Hugh Jackman was just as good as Valijean and he moved me with his performance. Russell Crowe was surprisingly good and I was impressed at his singing voice. We also got some great performances out of Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baren Cohen, and Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great, well-done musical version of this classic novel. The production values are top-notch and the songs are wonderfully sung. The original song, ""Suddenly"" was a welcome addition to the film. Don't be ashamed if this makes you cry by the end, because it definitely will. I rate this film 9/10."

","This movie was one of the best movies I've ever watched. Great Cast, Great Plot, Great Directing, everything was great. In fact I think I watched it like 20 times and now I've memorized it. Really moving and great. At first I didn't know It was a musical but when I saw it, I was like ""WOW""! I think this movie's way better than that Titanic Movie. It was great and moving but I think this movie deserved those Academy awards titanic won ,too. I think that this movie should be in the top rated ones, too I mean it really teaches you so many things, in fact it taught me so many things because well I'm 15 and it really makes a lot of sense to me and makes me realize so many things. I really liked the role of Javert played by Russell Crowe, one of the greatest actors ever. It was a moving character and I really wanted to read the novel and had in mind of watching the film and out of nowhere once I watched it and for 2 days I couldn't watch anything else. This happened to me with The Godfather, The Dark Knight and Gladiator and also A Beautiful mind and L.A. Confidential. I highly recommend people who haven't seen this movie yet to watch it."
"zquintofan","10","1","1","20 March 2014"," Stunning
","When I first watched this movie I was a bit skeptical as to how it would turn out, after all, when a movie has to include so many famous actors and actresses in it, it generally spells disaster and the writing and directing fall so short that the movie is a train wreck, nothing short of abominable. With Les Mis, not so. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman did a fantastic job with his role as the incredibly conflicted Jean Valjean and Anne Hathaway was brilliant as well, even though we didn't see much of her. My personal favorite character though was Javert. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe did a phenomenal job with his part and I really enjoyed seeing a different side to Javert, not just the evil man that a lot of actors portray when they play the part. All in all I really couldn't call him a villain because he was so convinced that Valjean was the criminal and when he finally came to terms with the fact that Valjean had changed it wasn't that he just didn't want to believe it, it was that he had wasted umpteen years of his life chasing down a man who proved that everything he believed was false. <br/><br/>The music was wonderful and some of the sets they had were breathtaking. I thoroughly enjoyed the rooftop scene when Javert was singing Stars because it was just a really beautiful scene. <br/><br/>The film was fairly emotional, barring the occasional moments where my father would sigh and upset the feeling of the scene, as he did not feel quite as enthused about being there as I was. <br/><br/>The last few scenes will leave you weeping so bring some Kleenex, and don't wear eyeliner.<br/><br/>Overall it was a fantastic movie."

"jenniferregnier333","8","1","1","17 February 2014"," Les Miserables
","Les Miserables was originally a book written by Victor Hugo. However, it has since been created into a Broadway production and a movie, more than once. This movie stands out from all of the others for having a story that contains so much emotion. Its themes range from love, to fear, to hope, to anger, and to power. As a movie viewer, one will experience all of the emotions along with the character and by the end of the production the viewers are left feeling refreshed. This is an outstanding musical drama, because the acting is real and believable and the cinematography is incredible. <br/><br/>In this 19th century French film, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) plays a man who has been in jail for 19 years, only for stealing a loaf of bread. After being released, he soon finds himself not liking the person he is becoming and sees the errors in his ways. The film fast forwards eight years later, and he is a sophisticated factory man, and the town's mayor. However, he is being hunted for breaking his parole by, the policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe). As this goes on, the viewers come across Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who has lost her pride to the point of despondency to pay for her child Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), who is staying with a stingy inn-keeper and his selfish wife. During the film, Jean Valjean comes to be the care taker of Fantine's daughter, Cosette. Throughout the movie, the viewers see how the characters interconnect with one another and those connections then build up the intensity of love, hope, redemption, forgiveness and revolution. <br/><br/>These passions are shown thoroughly through the actors because they create an authentic emotion for the audience to get sucked into. Many of the actors that are in this film are known for their acting, yet in this film viewers see a new side of each actor. One of the unique characteristics of this film is the actors never lip-synced. As they were filming, they were also singing live, and because of this more emotion was brought out in the movie. This may have made the singing rougher and seem raw. However, this does not demean the story line of this film. On the contrary, it heightens the believability, creating a raw emotion from each character. Another way the actors got into character was giving up something personal. During a scene, Hathaway sells her hair and during the production of the film it was actually cut off. This shows that she is portraying the sincere emotion of losing her hair. <br/><br/>Another part that enhances this movie's production is the cinematography. The director, Tom Hooper, chose many of the scenes to be close ups which helps to capture the emotion in the character's faces for the audience to see. Since the camera gets in close proximity, one is able to see every emotion vividly. The viewers are able to see the hope that still remains and the loss that will never leave their eyes. The lighting enhances their emotion as well. The director made sure to show the darker scenes to correlate the despair people have, especially when showing all of the poverty that France had at the time of the film. However, at the same time, he would show lightness and almost a glow in the actors face to show the hope they were searching for. <br/><br/>Les Miserables is a fantastic musical because it creates a feeling of hope inside of the viewers. This movie does the difficult task of having a wide array of emotions such as anger to happiness, love to heartbreak, and grief to hope. Nevertheless, the viewer's feel the experience of each emotion and empathy for that character is held in your heart. Before you see this movie prepare yourself to have every emotion ripped out from your body, tear by tear."
"chazbert","9","1","1","16 February 2014"," Great but...
","This classic musical is a masterpiece of course and the movie is also very entertaining, emotional and full of action, but must every little bit be sung it does get a bit annoying I mean the main songs are fine but they could just talk normally at some points like Phantom of the opera that is another great musical but not every little bit is sung, anyway that is the only bad thing really the rest of the movie is fantastic so good I got it on DVD of course my favourite song in the whole musical is I dreamed a dream and one day more them to songs just draw me in more to watch, them songs are the main reason I started watching Les Misérables and I will watch many more times."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","1","1","29 January 2014"," Finely crafted musical experience.
","Unlike most men, I'm not ashamed to say that I enjoy musicals. Every spring since I was a teenager my family and I would go watch the spring play at the prep school my mom works at. They put on a Broadway level show, no joke. <br/><br/>That being said, I was looking forward to Les Miserables. I really like Anne Hathaway and I got goosebumps just watching her performance of ""I dreamed a dream"" in the trailer. <br/><br/>The performances are what really carries the film. Hugh Jackman is haunting as Jean Valjean and Russll Crowe adds very stern and rugged vocals to Javert. Anne Hathaway turns in one of the most powerful scenes you will see in a movie all year. <br/><br/>Her head is shaven, her eyes are about to burst with tears, she has snot dripping out of her nose. It doesn't get any more vulnerable than that. <br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add some much needed comic relief. Then, a little more than half way through the film, something very interesting happens. Something that makes film so exciting. Les Miserables is stolen from some of the biggest actors Hollywood has to offer by newcomer Samantha Barks who plays Eponine, who's tragically in love with a man who has fallen in love with another woman. <br/><br/>Many people are going to have a hard time getting past the fact that everything in the film is sung. Yes...everything. The other problem is that the last act of the film really involves the French revolution. This sometimes seems out of place because the first half of the film really had nothing to do with the war. These are small problems and don't hurt the film. <br/><br/>Les Miserables is easily one of the most powerful films of the year, packed with some truly tear-jerking scenes. Guy or girl doesn't matter, go see Les Miserables."
"abpod09","8","1","1","28 January 2014"," A matter of taste
","Personally, even though I like musicals and being a musician myself, I thought there was just way too much singing in this movie.<br/><br/>Not to knock the fantastic job the whole cast did. I know Hugh Jackman spent around 14 hours a day singing in shooting for this film, and all the main characters are just stellar at it. (Who knew Russell Crowe could sing a lick, much less do such a good job at it?)<br/><br/>I just have a problem in that music - and not all that linear. Some of the lyrics' structures are pretty out there, especially when several stories intertwine, you can't understand a thing - is being used as a CONSTANT vehicle to tell the story, rather than highlight key moments in the drama. For my taste, I just feel the narrative of the story gets gently swept away in all that music, as I do feel the movie would benefit so much more from more constant, traditional storytelling without all that musical weight.<br/><br/>But on the flip side, it is a dream cast, every actor is pitch perfect - no pun intended - in their role, the sets and wardrobe are outstanding and Tom Hooper does an amazing job is portraying the griminess of it all, when need be. (Though I could do without some of the independent-y ""alternative"" looking shots scattered throughout)<br/><br/>Absolutely no knock on the movie as a whole. Everyone does a wonderful job. For me, it's really just a matter of taste.<br/><br/>An easy 8 out of 10."

","""Les Misérables"" is a classic movie that we have seen it in many ways and with many casts. This time we have a movie which is musical and it's really different from all the other movies of ""Les Misérables"". The cast of this movie is really great but this singing I think that it was not the best.<br/><br/>Willingly or not I compared this movie of ""Les Misérables"" with the other movies of ""Les Misérables"" which I have seen and I believe that this movie despite that it's a musical it was lower and not as good as the previous.<br/><br/>Finally I want to tell you that if you want to see the true ""Les Misérables"" then you have to see the ""Les Misérables"" of 1998 which has an outstanding interpretations of Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman and of course Geoffrey Rush. If you like now the old movies then I suggest you the ""Les Miserables"" movie of 1978 that it's equally great as the previous."
"vze3vhtf","6","1","1","14 January 2014"," Ambitious, Star-Studded, But MIS-CAST...
","I have been a big fan of LM ever since watching the broadcast of the 10th Anniversary Production back in 1995, which I thought was stunning.<br/><br/>Then came the 25th Anniversary in 2010, which was probably staged better, but in my view did not have quite as strong of a cast. <br/><br/>So now we finally have the big-budget film version, with an all-star cast.<br/><br/>The result?<br/><br/>Well, unfortunately, it appears the producers sacrificed actual talent that was right for the roles, for name-recognition in those roles:<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as Jean-Valjean: Jackman is a talented actor, with a competent singing voice. <br/><br/>But this role required a talented actor, and one who could convey aging, and one with a SUPERB singing voice. <br/><br/>Every moment Jackman was in a scene, I could not avoid envisioning the awesome world-weary power of Colm Wilkinson from the 1995 Production, and how there is really no comparison (Alfie Boe from the 2010 Production was also good, but he seemed too young & frail for what this character called for-at least to me).<br/><br/>So to put this in perspective, think of either Wilkinson or Boe trying to play ' Wolverine ', and you can see my point. <br/><br/>Russel Crowe as Javert: Again, we have a talented actor, but if Jackman's singing voice is at least competent, Crowe's is almost non-existent! <br/><br/>Maybe, in Crowe's case, instead of recording the songs in real-time on the set, they SHOULD have dubbed them in later! It might have made him less painful to listen to! <br/><br/>It made me nostalgic for Philip Quast.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway is beautiful and can act, but again, she only has a mediocre singing voice. Not in the same league as either Ruthie Henshall, or Lea Salonga.<br/><br/>Sacha-Baron Cohen: I just did not buy this guy as Thenardier. I saw none of the rodent-faced menace or style as that of Alun Armstrong. Too young & too fresh-faced. Not the right role for ' Borat '<br/><br/>The remaining cast were for the most part newcomers, and were good under the circumstances.<br/><br/>M"
"Lukebob-Spongepants","7","1","1","9 December 2013"," Never Watched Before
","I was told the film contained little to no dialogue and that the entire film would be sung which threw me off a little. I'm not oblivious to theatre, but I'm not exactly a die hard fan either. The actual acting is top notch, don't think they could have chosen a better cast, although Crowe is not the best singer. Hathaway plays a great part, for the time she has, and Baron-Cohen lights up the film along with Bonham-Carter. Samantha Barks was great, she has a lovely voice and is the perfect fit for Eponine. The story itself, this being the first time experiencing, was OK. Partially predictable and I'm not sure it belongs on movie screens, it seemed like one big play really. Not taking anything away from the actors, it just wasn't the sort of film I could watch more than once or twice."
"pc95","5","1","1","14 October 2013"," Great Songs/ Poor Singing
","I remember seeing a professional theater company put-on ""Les Miserables"" in the early 90s. It was a romp of a performance and production. The music numbers came back to life with the movie. This new movie lit up my memory, and although I commend the actors for giving their best in singing, none of them save Amanda Seyfried are very good. So what does that suggest? Well, here is a musical without good singing, so it's not really recommended. The production was enhanced fairly competently by computer generated backgrounds, and I especially liked the introductory scenes, however as I'm sure is already noted, the movie runs and runs and...it feels like 180 min vice 150. Anyway, if you liked the play, this may be worth a watch and listen, despite it's execution, to judge for yourself."
"IAAL","9","1","1","12 October 2013"," Excellent demonstration of why vocal training matters
","I finally got around to seeing this. Absolutely terrific in very many ways, but, while I do understand the marketing appeal of using big-name movie stars, this movie just goes to show you that there's a long distance between ""can sing pretty well"" and ""can handle opera."" Crowe and Jackman were definitely in the former category, in my view. (As were Cohen and Carter, but those were comic roles so they could get away with it.) Javert and Valjean are super-challenging parts, from a musical perspective; it's not just that there's a lot of singing, it's also that those are HARD, counter-intuitive tunes, and it's just really obvious when the singer is struggling to hit the notes. The only way opera is the tiniest bit credible is when the singer is good enough to persuade you that this singing thing is just the way he happens to talk, and I never thought Crowe or Jackman got there.<br/><br/>On the other hand, they weren't on screen all the time. Hathaway, the other big-name star, totally nailed it. AMAZING voice. I had of course seen the ""I Dreamed a Dream"" clip before -- hard to avoid if you don't live under a rock -- so I knew that would be great, but her dialogue singing was just as good. She richly deserved that Oscar. And Seyfried and Redmayne and Barks were just terrific. Barks has more of a pop style than an operatic one, but I thought it worked really well. So there was a lot to love, in the singing department. And the music itself is just magnificent. I always think the ""Tonight Quintet"" section of ""West Side Story"" is really wonderful in its complexity, but ""Les Mis"" is like two and a half hours of that stuff. And great photography and locations and costuming and all the rest of it. So, 9 stars, but falls short of 10, to me, because the best you could say about Crowe and Jackman as opera singers is that they were pretty good, considering."

","Apart from a few epic exceptions, I'm not into musicals, which may be the reason it took me so long to check out Les Miserables, but I finally watched it, and honestly found more than what I expected. The promising cast surely meets the high expectations from such a story and production, resulting in a very, very good musical in my opinion. Anne Hathaway was brilliant, hats off to her, yes, but no one's performance was disappointing anyway! Almost every scene was bursting with feeling (various feelings, that is), successfully reflected thanks to the director as well as the cast. Every actor obviously put a lot of effort and made their talents talk, and so it's been a pleasure to watch this version of Les Miserables. The second half was exceptionally emotional and there were quite a few scenes that blew me away. One of them certainly Gavroche, Javert and the medal (*gulps*). The flow was, however, rather slow t certain parts of the movie, but can't thinks of any other major problems with Les Miserables. All in all, I'm glad I checked it out. A goodie of the genre for sure. A 7/10 for me, only because I can't do 7.5 on IMDb."

","Wow. The movie was simply extraordinary. At first you're like, OMG they sing so much, but then you're watching it and you don't notice that they are still singing. The acting on all parts was phenomenal. Hugh Jackman is a superb actor. He can excellently portray Wolverine and Jean Valjean!! I mean that takes a lot of talent. There was not one thing about the movie that I wish they had changed. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were excellent in their roles, being the perfect comic relief, in such a heartbreaking story. Eddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit were exquisite and dreamy the entire time. Samantha Barks rocked the role as Eponine, the forever friend-zoned poor girl. Her chemistry with Eddie, when she died was amazing. Amanda did really well, she has a beautiful voice and although she didn't have a lot of screen time, when she was on screen she made her presence known. Daniel Huttlestone who played Gavroche was awesome, so much talent for 14 year old. Russell Crowe, who played Javert, in my personal opinion was great. I didn't think his singing was horrible, like everyone else, I really liked it. Anne Hathaway was perfection, no more no less, no more words to be said. The sets were awesome and realistic and I felt as if I was in France during the revolution. The closing scene brought tears to my eyes, and trust me, it is hard to make me cry. I love history and I think this story, written by Victor Hugo, could have happened back then, and I hope that makes other people interested in history. The movie wasn't too gory, just sad (aka Empty Chairs scene). Even if you absolutely detest musicals, I don't care GO SEE THIS ONE! You will not regret it!"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","1","1","26 June 2013"," Its sweeping cinematic world does justice to the brilliant story. Songs were stuck in my head for weeks.
","I'd always heard of the famous stage show Les Miserables but I've never known what it's about or why it's so famous, just the iconography of Cosette. When I heard the director of The King's Speech, which is a good if not very cinematic film, was making a film adaptation, I didn't really think twice. Once the Oscar race picked up I kept hearing the title more and more and once I saw the making of video they showed in cinemas everywhere it finally caught my attention and I have been expecting it to sweep the Oscars and become a sensation even if I didn't think it deserves it and I wanted this film to be my introduction to the story. That fell apart after post- first screening backlash with some very harsh criticisms and then especially when Tom Hooper wasn't nominated (or barely considered) for Best Director at the Oscars. This wasn't too unexpected, but my firm prediction is now more or less impossible. Granted, I never expected to be a big fan of the film, just that everyone else would be. <br/><br/>With lowered expectations but an open mind, I was delighted to find myself swept up in the film immediately. It's loud but catchy and simultaneously epic and intimate. There were many moments which gave me goosebumps, particularly the sweeping transitions between scenes. Beyond the aspects exclusive to cinema, what really got me was the incredible story, rich with moral dilemmas and a fascinating network of characters. Although it may rush from character to character, the detail is enough for just the right taste. Hugh Jackman's passionate performance is the highlight and is utterly engrossing from beginning to end. Russell Crowe appears flat but it is deliberately so. His character is one of the most interesting, who's moments of change are profound if sometimes cryptic. Ann Hathaway deserves all the acclaim and although at times it feels over-rehearsed, it's all sincere and heartbreaking. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen's Sweeney Todd reunion is a welcome comic relief in their introduction but they quickly outstay this welcome and make more appearances than I felt necessary. Fortunately, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron Tveit and Samantha Barks are incredible and balance out that second half.<br/><br/>However, even if the production design provides the film's distinct and dramatic atmosphere, the cinematography is an absolute mess. Using hand-held photography, particularly during the singing numbers is a big risk and most of the time, it wasn't one worth taking as all the little mistakes, such as if the camera operator were to bump into a table while tracking the actor, are completely transparent. For the most part, Les Miserables is a very immersive film, but those mistakes took me out of the moment if just for a brief second and reminded me of that making of video that intrigued me of the film in the first place and made me think of how it was made. Unfortunately, the editing can't keep up, and is just as sloppy but the positives of the film allow these to be excused. The one merit out of this is that it does add a significant element of grit to the film, but this could have been achieved just as well with the art direction. Besides the near- redundant and overlong introduction to the revolution with the barricades and Russell Crowe confusingly switching sides, Les Miserables is a compelling and moving film which really surprised me, with a great cinematic flavour. Beats King's Speech anyway.<br/><br/>8/10"

As evil, tortured policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) points out, it would have been five, for stealing that loaf of bread for his nephew, but Valjean's later obstinance resulted in more time to be served. Now, Jean is going somewhat free, he is released, but he must check-in with a parole officer every month for the REST OF HIS LIFE, as a dangerous criminal. Ha! Such is the miserable life for those without money in middle 19th century France. To be sure, there was a revolution but now there's another king and the life of the poor is still desperate. Meanwhile, Fantine (Anne Hathaway) is earning a pittance at a fabric mill so that she can send money to the caretakers of her young daughter, Cosette (later, Amanda Siefried), the Thenadiers (Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen). This must be done in secret, for the child is illegitimate, a huge no-no of the times. Alas, Fantine's secret is discovered, she loses her job, sinks into prostitution and poverty, and dies in Valjean's arms, who promises to find Cosette and take care of her. Jean has been in disguise for several years as the MAYOR of a town but Javert is after him again. Happily, Valjean does find Cosette, buys her from the caretakers who have used the little girl as a slave, and begins a new life in another city. Flash forward another few years. Now, Cosette is a beautiful young lady and she falls in love with a revolutionist, Marius, whose spirit is strong but whose actions may result in his death. Will Valjean be able to rescue the both of them, all the while still keeping a step ahead of Javier, who relentlessly pursues him? Wow, what a glorious film this is, made from an equally marvelous musical adaptation of Hugo's seering, timeless tale of the poor in mid-century 1800 France. The music is breathtaking and director Tom Hooper has added punch with his recording of the songs live. All of the cast is likewise wonderful, with Jackman, Crowe, Hathaway, Siefried, and all of the rest singing and acting our socks off. A special word of praise should go to Bonham Carter and Cohen for their vastly amusing yet treacherous performances. Then, too, the production is replete with fantastic art direction, costumes, sets, and photography. So, you think you hate musicals? You might do a hairpin turn into the other direction if you view this fine, fine film."
"jdkraus","8","1","1","9 June 2013"," A very good musical, but it has its hiccups
","Les Miserables is such a good story that it has been made into dozens of movies, Broadway plays, and even a musical. Having seen the Liam Neeson and Richard Chamberlain versions, the plot is very familiar to me. Watching the musical Broadway version brought to the screen by Tom Hooper was something refreshing and new. <br/><br/>The conventional musical is driven by a plot with long scenes of dialog, followed by intermittent musical numbers. The great old classics like ""The Sound of Music"" and ""West Side Stories"" were in part successful because of this. This technique gives the audience time to anticipate and enjoy the singing and music as well as comprehend the movie's plot at the same time. ""Les Miserables"" on the other hand breaks this well known method. The entire film is true music; each musical sequence follows the other without a break or a chance for any dialog. This is a very unique and creative technique. However, it presents a double-edged sword. <br/><br/>From the positive, it presents solid entertainment. There are no dull scenes or elongated monologues by the characters. You can close your eyes and see exactly what it is happening without even watching it like listening to a CD. The negative, it may annoy and confuse the audience, specifically individuals who seek the typical musical movie style. Even worse, the movie can deliver an incomplete story that makes no sense. There are scenes in this movie that quickly jump from one thing to the next without any explanation, much less giving the viewer enough to digest the information from the prior musical number. The plot becomes jumbled and incoherent on several occasions. While the music and singing is beautiful, some of it is very soft-spoken, which makes it even harder to understand. In already knowing the story of ""Les Miserables"" though, these hiccups do not affect me very much. Through the whole movie, I fondly watched each moment with a gentle smile on my face.<br/><br/>The wisely-chosen cast is what really make this film successful. Each actor and actress immersed themselves into their roles. The prominent ones are Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, who give the performances of their lives. Of the two, Jackman no doubt had the more challenging role. He not only had to sing for the two hours and thirty-seven minute film, but he had to undergo physical transformations for his character. On top of that, he had to act with powerful emotion. Within the first ten minutes, I can tell he put everything he had into this role. He became Jean Valjean in body, mind, and soul. His golden globe win and Oscar nomination was well worth it. I would very much like to see Jackman break his action hero norm more for some dramatic performances. <br/><br/>Being in the movie under twenty minutes, Anne Hathaway delivered one of the most devastating performances an audience can ask for as Fontaine. Like Jackman, her physical appearance is changed, but her solo ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is enough to make a sensible viewer weep. It is amazing that one five-minute scene can win someone an Oscar, a golden globe, a Screen Actor's Guild, and a BAFTA. And she deserved it. While the rest of the cast is decent, they are dwarfed in comparison to Jackman and Hathaway. Even the great Russell Crowe as Javert does not stand very strong in comparison to the intensely passionate Hugh Jackman. Neither do the quirky Sacha Baren Cohen and funny Helena Bonham Carter make an equal to the powers of Jackman and Hathaway. A big shocker indeed. They all have a very good singing voices. Crowe has a band after all. Both Carter and Cohen starred in Sweeney Todd together (bringing some elements of those past characters to life I might add)<br/><br/>""Les Miserables"" is a very good movie. Great music. Great singing. Great cast. Great costumes and set pieces. But if you're expecting a musical with a great story, it will not be found here. Many things are left implied. It will better that you know the story in advance before viewing this film."

","This is a brilliant, poignant story of the shades of grey in which we live our lives. There is no good or bad person in this story - there are only circumstances. Having seen the Broadway (very good) and West End (Outstanding) versions of this Victor Hugo classic and having read the book, I was apprehensive about the movie. Feared it would be a ""Hollywoodised"" version which generally destroy English and European classics. Am I glad I was wrong! Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackson and Eddie Redmayne were outstanding in their roles and the rest were only marginally less, but still brilliant. I doubt any person after having seen this will leave without more than a few tears in their eyes. Truly deserves a 10/10!"
"christine-705-717153","10","1","1","7 June 2013"," ""Those who do not weep, do not see."" –Victor Hugo, Les Misérables
","I wept through much of Les Misérables, and Tom Hopper, Les Mis's Director, earned every fallen tear. I wasn't alone. Everyone around me wept, and since it was a sold-out crowd, we were weeping very close to the strangers who surrounded us. It was no matter. We were all in the tragedy together. We all knew there would be pain and death, still hopeful to see what the other side of that coin held, and we felt it deep inside. I am a better person for having seen this movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to bring a play to the screen, especially a musical. I think some of the great musicals have been ruined by the screen. Annie. Phantom of the Opera. Evita. Such disappointments. Maybe the problem with Evita was Madonna, who could never be Eva Perón, but whatever the reason, it didn't work. Chicago? Don't get me started. Les Misérables is better on the screen. The story lends itself to the fluidity of the scene changes, which are less disruptive in a movie. Or it might be that the way it was filmed, having the actors sing their lines on camera rather than in the studio, made it work better. I generally don't like dialogue in song, and I was worried about it before I saw the movie, but you hardly notice it. And this new method of acting with singing in tandem to acting could be the reason why.<br/><br/>Really, it's all about Victor Hugo's masterpiece, which I have been lost in since the movie. Hugo somehow understood that the pendulum swings equally toward bad and good, and he knew how to bring that understanding to life through storytelling. The worse the bad, the greater the capability for good. The so very believable love at first sight between Marius and Cosette cannot be taken in without the hate felt by Javert toward Jean Valjean. Les Misérables has all the sensations of living a truly full, human, flawed life. Love. Weakness. Strength. Hatred. Charity. Faith. Betrayal. But love is the greatest of them all.<br/><br/>""When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit. Love, soar."" ―Victor Hugo, Les Misérables<br/><br/>Can't wait to talk about the acting.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway, I wasn't looking forward to seeing you. Despite the hype, I find you somewhat ridiculous, and it did not occur to me you had it in you. But you do. Your scene singing perhaps one of the greatest songs written for the stage is by far the best one ever done. I am a fan forever. Hugh Jackman, I felt your pain. Your love. Your charity. You embodied every emotion that matters to me, and each time you wore it, you did it from within. Have you recovered yet? You must win the Academy Award for this performance, not just because it was the best I've seen this year, but also because it matters. It showed us the potential we carry within ourselves, and a grateful viewer thanks you for this. Amanda Syfried, the innocent Cosette, was predictably poised on the screen, but seemed to struggle a bit with her high notes. Truth is, I don't much like her. Saw her on Letterman, which I recognize is a ridiculous reference, but she was a twit, and I just can't say much about her. Russell. Russell. Russell. I want to be kind here—the movie makes me want to do that—but alas, you were not up to the job. I respect you greatly, and my disappointment was less in your performance than in the fact that you should have known this was not your role to play, and you should have left it for someone else. A bunch of us decided Bono could have played the role, and he could have sung it well too. This is the worst of your crimes, Russell. Lastly, your singing talent wasn't up to the challenge. I contend you knew it all along. Just as you knew Jean Valjean was a better man than you.<br/><br/>But the character who stole my heart was Eponine. Lonely, suffering Eponine, brilliantly portrayed by Samantha Barks, who is new to the screen. I hope to see her again and again. Her minimalist approach to her character made her all the stronger. Her voice was kind and gentle in its painful message, and I could hear it inside my soul. You were marvelous, and don't let anyone leave you out of the kudos because you haven't had box office draw capability. Your time will come.<br/><br/>There are a few small things to iron out. The opening scene with the ship being pulled into port. Not so much. Sorry. The scene in the Inn. Offensively over the top. Out of place a bit. Unnecessary. The two coffins set in front of the barricade. Not so much. The butterflies when Cosette sees Marius in the garden. Don't be ridiculous. But those are minor offenses in a movie that spans a generation and teaches us everything about life in two and a half hours. There are those who say it was too long. It was not too long. It was the length it needed to be to tell the story at a pace that allowed us to take it in.<br/><br/>We were taken to the depths of the dark bowels, and for a few hours we were shown great truths there, and we emerged better for it."
"richardosborne14","10","1","1","4 June 2013"," ""Les Misérables is Tom Hooper's masterpiece...""
","Les Misérables is nothing short of magnificent. Tom Hooper's version of the world-famous stage show and novel stars Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, once a slave on the run, now a new man hoping his past, and the ruthless Javert (Russell Crowe) do not come back to haunt him, as he vows to raise Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) after her factory worker mother Fantine (Anne Hathaway) dies.<br/><br/>Hooper shows ambition with every decision he makes, the largest of which was to have the cast sing live on camera instead of dubbing afterwards in the studio. This decision made this a film that stands out like a spy among rebels, and Hooper and the cast's conviction taking it through the film may have allowed them to create the finest film of the year.<br/><br/>Watching the film with the knowledge of the actors singing live just brings everything to life, as if you are really there. Forget 3D effects, Hugh Jackman's 'Who Am I?' comes out of the screen more than Avatar (James Cameron, 2009) ever will. And when you know the singing is real, you have to question whether the blood, sweat and tears that go with each number are real too. Especially when certain members of the cast are shown in one long take without cutting away, you realise you are no longer in the cinema watching Hathaway playing Fantine, you are there on the streets of France watching Fantine herself. From her rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream,' that will break even the hardest of hearts, to the hilarious 'Master Of The House' by Sasha Baron Cohen (in his best role for years) and Helena Bonham Carter, each number permeates the theatre with such raw emotion that we could well be seeing it performed live in front of us. Other sequences worth noting are Samantha Barks (who played Éponine in both the film and on stage) singing 'On My Own' and the exceptional performances by the young Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche and Isabelle Allen as the young Cosette.<br/><br/>Danny Cohen's cinematography is also due a mention. The camera does not simply show us the story, it participates. The camera is used as another instrument of the orchestra, it's movement or lack thereof is so in tune with the musical numbers. At times menacingly low, or hauntingly high and often using Dutch angles, it shakily but fluidly moves around at street level, almost barging crowd members out of the way to get right in the faces of the key players. At other times, the use of cranes and steadicams allow us to sweep gracefully through courtyards and over roofs, looking down on the 'desire and despair' we have just been part of.<br/><br/>In all aspects, Les Misérables is Tom Hooper's masterpiece, a much more worthy contender for Best Picture than his previous offering, the wrongly awarded The Kings Speech (2010). The performances so real, the design so endlessly detailed, and the visuals and music are non-stop breath-taking. We do not watch or witness this story; we are invited by all involved to actively take part. However, in a story of such misery, it is unfortunately Hooper himself who will come out crowned as 'Le Misérable,' after being tragically omitted from the Best Director category in last week's Oscar nominations."

","I have read the book, seen the musical many times. This is a wonderful movie. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is off the charts. My hat is off to Tom Hooper for collecting so many talented people capable of giving such powerful performances! Anne Hathaway's scenes alone made this movie worth watching, and Hugh Jackman is no longer Wolverine in my mind, but Jean Valjean.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie for the themes of Grace, Salvation, and forgiveness that eco throughout. It is a wonderful thing to see so clearly Law against Grace, as Javert is against Jean Valjean. Valjean was a lost man burdened with his sin until he is given Mercy and redeemed by the priest, really by God. (As are we all)<br/><br/>His soul set free, and knowing now what mercy is, he extends it to Javert. Javert can not reconcile the Law and Grace and it eats at him and conflicts with his soul until he can stand it no more.<br/><br/>This is a lesson that the Law alone will kill and destroy men, but with grace we can all be saved."
"rachelandfilms","9","1","1","29 May 2013"," Too good to fit in a summary title
","Les Miserables, or 'Les Mis' as it is known in the theatre-loving world, is a musical production based on the 19th century novel by Victor Hugo which chronicles the life of Jean Valjean, a convicted bread-thief who, after serving 19 years for his ""crime"", is freed and sets out to create a new life under the guidance of God. This does not go down well with Russell Crowe's character, Jalvert, who makes it his life mission to track Valjean and send him back to prison. This is where our story begins, though certainly not where it ends, for it sets in motion a whole host of events which involve saving tragic-Fantine's orphan child Cossette and raising her in the midst of a French Revolution. Like I said, there's a lot to get your head around<br/><br/>Director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech) does so though, and with incredible flair and an imagination and determination which ensured that this multiple Oscar-winning production will go down in film history. Here Hooper has assembled an incredibly talented set of actors and brought to life one of the most celebrated novels and theatre- productions in history, for the screen. The typical course of action on a musical production, especially one of this magnitude, is to pre-record the soundtrack and have the stars lip-sync on set. Here, however, Hooper took a different approach and recorded every song live on set, in order to capture the spontaneity and emotional responses of the actors – a move which has been praised by both his cast and critics alike. A feat like this has never been attempted before, making Hooper, ironically enough, somewhat of a revolutionary<br/><br/>If you would like to read the rest of my thoughts on this film then visit this site (filmrambler.blogspot.co.uk)"

Valjean is driven out of every town, because of his paroled status. He is offered food and shelter by the Bishop of Digne (Colm Wilkinson), but steals his silver during the night. He is captured by the authorities, but the Bishop informs them that the silver was given as a gift, then gives him even more, securing Valjean's release. Moved by the Bishop's grace, Valjean breaks his parole, vowing to start an honest life helping others under a new identity. Javert swears he will bring the escaped convict to justice.<br/><br/>Eight years later, in 1823 Valjean has become a factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer.the goodness of bishop changed his way of life.He gets into trouble when he encounters javert in search of him,but he was not recognized by javert.After that he flees with an 8 years old child(daughter of one of his factory worker)then an lifelong game of police and thieve starts.<br/><br/>CAST-No personal introduction needed,each and every cast of the movie was doing awesome.

"FairlyAnonymous","8","1","1","22 May 2013"," A great musical that accomplishes a lot
","I will say that I was a little hesitant about watching this movie, because I have learned from experience that most musical gain critical praise from audiences for no reason other than being a musical (Phantom of the Opera, Moulin Rouge and many others) so I was kind of expecting this movie to be mediocre. However, I will say that I was surprised at how well this movie was made and how this movie will probably stick out above most musicals for some years to come.<br/><br/>The movie has a great soundtrack some really good songs. I will say that I can't really remember the tunes to any of the songs (except one) but I do remember the dialogue and the message behind each song. This is a good thing because it shows that the movie was able to successfully use music in place of dialogue. If you didn't know, all of this movie is sung. Every word of dialogue is sung in some manner or another, and while this sounds like it would be annoying the movie actually manages to pull it off quite nicely. I will say that a couple of the actors have a little bit of trouble hitting the high notes and are slightly off key, however the main stars here (Crowe and Jackman) show that they are actually quite good at singing. I was surprised but they both have really good singing voices. Overall everyone did a nice job at acting.<br/><br/>One problem that kind of annoyed me was the flow of the songs. Since the movie is all music that means there are no real breaks from music. However, the movie has some bad flow from one song to the next. For example, there is a giant grand song about everyone preparing for battle the next day. Then we see the next literally 10 seconds afterwords and they start singing again in another giant grand song. This bad placement of two songs makes the second song lose emphasis. In a musical you are supposed to separate big songs from each other so that there is a build-up to each song so that there is more importance to the grand song. But when two grand songs are placed right next to each other that means there is no importance or significance to either of the songs.<br/><br/>Now one thing that also makes this movie stick out compared to most musicals is that it has a very large budget for a musical. The sets and costumes look really nice, and even when CGI is used it generally looks fairly nice. The movie has a really grand scale at times given the good use of sets to make everything feel bigger than it really is. Unfortunately though the final battle at the end of the movie feels quite the opposite which I thought was kind of odd. The rest of the movie has this grand scale and yet the final battle is clustered, claustrophobic, and rather small compared to the rest of the movie. I found this kind of annoying, but then again the French Rebellion wasn't really all that impressive.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the length of the movie and I can agree with that and disagree with that. This movie definitely needs to be this long because if anything were taken out I think it would've made the movie more confusing. Though I will admit my biggest issue with the movie was the second act. The first act was really intriguing and interesting and the third act is the climax, yet the second act... doesn't really do much. It just kind of sits there and throws in about six new characters to the plot, none of which I really cared about. That is probably my biggest issue with the movie is that I only really cared about two of the characters: Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman... well Javert and Valjean but it is easier to just say the actors names. All of the characters seemed like additional distractions from the main plot which is about Valjean's redemption from his criminal past. Though, the original book had a lot more side arcs so I guess I can't complain too much.<br/><br/>All in all, Les Miserables is a good musical that gets the music down right, the acting is good, the sets and costumes are detailed and amazing, but it does have a few problems as far as distracted plots go and the overall movie length. I would suggest that any fans of good musicals should watch this movie as I enjoyed it very much."
"AvBaur","8","1","1","13 May 2013"," Admirable rather than likable
","Although I think the movie is very good, I must say I admired it more than I liked it. There are many things about it that are great, but it didn't grab me quite as much as I hoped it would, and certainly not as much as it did some of the sobbing and sniffing people sitting all around me in the theater.<br/><br/>Some of said great things: the fantastic actors, the live singing (which I found very effective - sans Russell Crowe), the impressive sets and costumes, and the extremely catchy songs.<br/><br/>As for why it didn't work even better for me? I think maybe it's that it seems a bit overstuffed. The original novel is one hell of a sprawling tale, and it's all a bit much for just one movie if you don't set a clear focus. There's a bit of a redemption story here, a bit of a love story there, and a bit of revolution for good measure. Focusing on just one of these might have made the movie more effective for me. I mean, it's clear that this is mostly Jean Valjean's story, but the movie seems to lose sight of him quite often to get a few more love songs and fight scenes in there.<br/><br/>But still, I think it's well worth seeing and I'll probably have about five different songs from it stuck in my head for the next week or two."

","This is my First Review.<br/><br/>Great Actors and Actresses but I think some of them don't suit the musical/piece.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway and also Russell Crowe & Amanda Seyfried. Hugh Jackman - i love almost all the movies. I guess a challenge for him to sing while acting. Anne Hathaway - is better in Ella Enchanted. She is a big WOW for me when she dance and sing there. I guess depends on the Director or what. Eddie Redmayne - have a nice voice but not much expressive.<br/><br/>WORST: - The cameraman/camera dept. very bad and disappointing and also Actors and Actresses must have their music coach. - Lack of expressions/ movements while doing some musical parts but not all. - Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen is better than the main cast in this movie. - I Dreamed a Dream part ~ CAMERA ""NO MOVEMENTS AROUND THE PLACE or AROUND FANTINE"" and FANTINE lack of expressing or the place is too small for her. So Sad and dull. - When arresting Fantine(Anne) Then the Mayor(Hugh) come near to her. ""The Camera"" ~ Why don't you just stop moving. darn!<br/><br/>Not that I'm not with this movie. The previous theatrical Les Miserables. Especially, When I watched the Les Miserables w/ Lea Salonga. Maybe, I just expect more in the movie part cause it is not live.<br/><br/>PROS: I love some musical parts. The thing is ""It is just not consisted."" Sometimes, it is wonderful. It makes me cry also when the time Eponine was shot. Saves the man who doesn't love her back. I just want main cast to be more highlighted.<br/><br/>I love to watch more the musical of ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" not with the Bloody things. HAHA.. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen and the other cast have a great voice. They express well the lyrics of their song. You know and feel what they are saying.<br/><br/>Anyway, still a Good Job. It is really hard to create musical. :)"
"ChristianUnchained","7","1","1","23 April 2013"," I dreamed a dream that this would be the definitive version of Les Mis...
","A strong cast, gorgeous original music, and a powerful performance by Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean makes Les Miserables a capable and confident re-imagining of the timeless classic. Despite what this new version succeeds in accomplishing, Les Miserable suffers from hackjob pacing and character development that makes the 2 hour and 40 minute runtime feel rushed and frantic. I had serious issues with this, because as important Jean Valjean is to the main story, there are other important characters too such as Inspector Javert, whose only character building came in the form of magically being where Jean was and being the anti-hero. The editing is terrible, and won't be receiving any awards. I was on the verge of contemplating tears at the end of the film, because as sad and incredibly bittersweet it is I was asking myself, ""why do I care?"" And in the end, because of the incredibly wacked out pacing, I didn't. This is as compressed of a Les Mis experience you can get, which is not a good thing.<br/><br/>But after all of the above, there are things that Hooper and the gang totally nail. The sets are fantastic, giving Les Mis a much needed ""down to gritty earth"" feeling in this day of age of movies. Anne Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed A Dream"" will send chills down you spine. The performances; Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Eddie Redmayne in particular, were powerful and confident. The original music has been re-orchestrated and it sounds beautiful. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, ESPECIALLY considering that this is a musical. The way they filmed it as well (by filming the drama and music at once, rather than recording the singing in a booth and the drama on screen and then splicing it together) is a big step for musical-to-film adaptations. And in this day of age of technical wizardry and big names and budgets it is impressive that we can have a musical film be incredibly successful (my theater was full).<br/><br/>So in light of all of these positives, it ends up being the movie part of Les Mis I have the biggest problem with (which is probably a bad thing right?). The ""too fast"" pacing and character development, which really distracted my appreciation of the film, and the emotional force leading up to the last moments of the film were just warm feelings, not true emotion were my two biggest complaints. <br/><br/>So Les Mis is still this: A fantastic and timeless story, filled with wonderful characters and incredible music all set within an incredible backdrop. I'll leave it at that, because I dreamed a dream that sort-of came true. I dreamed that Tom Hooper (who directed one of the best dramas I've ever seen, The King's Speech) was going to create the perfect film adaptation of Les Mis. He didn't, but he did a commendable job."
"TilTherWasUMe19","10","1","1","19 April 2013"," It was wonderful!
","This was absolutely wonderful! It was full of action, life, and sadness. Hugh Jackman's character had many trials in his life and Russell Crow's was very driven. Anne Hathaway's character sure had a rough life, and it is sad to think anyone would ever have to live like that. Secrets, lies, truths, and the fight for survival. I was surprised that 99% of the movie was sang and I had to remind myself that it is not just a movie but an opera. I had never seen the first one, but it was surprising. The actors did a magnificent job singing with heart. To see them cry, was astounding as you could see their eyes swell up with tears and watch them stream down their faces. I will definitely be buying this movie! I love musicals anyway, but this was exceptional! I feel that Russell Crow, Hugh Jackman & Ann Hathaway definitely came alive in this. So touching. It made me cry, sad, and happy! Thank you for a wonderful story line, great acting, and a heart-filled story."
"KineticSeoul","10","1","1","16 April 2013"," A excellent masterpiece!
","This is one of the most amazing film I have ever seen. It's over 2 hours and 30 minutes long but every moment of it is captivating and mesmerizing. It's like a modern generation ""The Sound of Music"". There is just so much heart and emotion in every scene. This is a musical where just about every dialogue is a musical and although it isn't the best singing of each song, it's the most emotional ones I seen so far. There are few places I wanted a bit more development but besides that this film is flawless. Plus it's probably to fit every aspect of the story in a certain amount of running time. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway got roles from this movie probably because of their performance hosting the Oscars. And they are just fantastic in this movie, and puts every ounce of effort and emotions into their scenes. Russell Crowe is also great in this despite the critics criticism when it comes to his singing. To be honest I thought his singing was fine and didn't get irritating to listen to. The supporting actors and actresses is also good. I know it sounds lame but watching this movie I felt my heart sing. If I don't give this movie a 10 I don't know what other film I would give it to besides few others. This is a movie that rarely comes out from Hollywood and it's a film that is a must watch. I was thoroughly hyped for this film when I saw the trailer and it beat my expectations.<br/><br/>10/10"
"stensson","7","1","1","1 April 2013"," Musical and revolt
","""Les Misérables"" is filled with intolerable sentimentality and some songs which are show-stoppers and I mean show-stoppers. It also has a social context, as Victor Hugo had, and this version focuses much on that. Which is good. Mainstream has for too long not wanted to worry audiences about such things.<br/><br/>All actors sing themselves and Russell Crowe has some real talent for it. The film is colorful also for other reasons, although 2,5 hours is a little too long. In stage versions, there is an intermission.<br/><br/>You can surely smell France in the early 1800s, although it maybe doesn't have much to do with the mood of Victor Hugo. But it's clever anyway."
"fellow456","6","1","1","10 March 2013"," For Fans and/or Novices
","Why you shouldn't see it:<br/><br/>You probably heard that Les Miserables is a musical. For the uninitiated, in this case, ""musical"" means nary a line is spoken. All dialog, internal or otherwise, is conveyed to the audience via song (and occasional dance). So if that sort of thing bothers you, I can't imagine that you'll get much of a kick out of this. But really, you've been fairly warned. I may be alone in this, but I think having an entirely musical movie is dangerous territory to tread, because of the difficult balancing act between having catchy tunes and songs that actually advance the plot. It seems like being catchy requires a hook, and most hooks are repetitive, and repetitive things don't really progress. Aside from that, the occasional downside of the musical format is partly inaudible dialog, which in turn stunts the progression of the plot for your mind if you didn't prepare for your film/play-watching by reading the Wikipedia article.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, if you do happen to peruse the Wikipedia article, you may surmise that this film is in fact based on a stage musical, which in turn was based on a novel. And not just any novel. A five part, 1500 page, 530,000 word novel that spans nearly 20 years and appears on Wikipedia's list of longest novels, right alongside the likes of War and Peace and Atlas Shrugged. In an industry that typically struggles to compress 150 page novels into two hour movies, I'm wondering what brilliant individual saw this piece that was ten times longer as a two and a half hour trip to the theater.<br/><br/>Apologies in advance, as I'm well aware that Les Mis is a wildly popular stage production I guess the above is more of a gripe with the original musical mind that saw the novel and decided to turn it into a play. From a story standpoint, the heavily downsized movie version seems disjointed to me, with the main culprits being the two times the screen just flashed the words ""Nine years later..."" How is this all one story? It isn't. It's five stories with common characters. Everything - namely the characters and their relations to one another - just comes across as abrupt when they change. I'm assuming these transitions are either more gradual or are presented in a manner more sensical in the novel, but in a shortened version, they only confused me. Really, I'm trying to figure out how the play became so popular, and I'm leaning toward the music being the key.<br/><br/>Why you should see it:<br/><br/>This is apparently a highly controversial point, but the main reason I would recommend anyone to see this movie is really just for the moments with Anne Hathaway, and, specifically, her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream."" This was an instance where the director's desire to have his actors act really paid off in my opinion, and I couldn't avoid getting goosebumps when I saw it. Some people will point to other performances of said song as much prettier renditions, but this is a woman in complete despair... Why would she sing beautifully in this moment? Anyway, I thought that one scene alone was fantastic and deserving of Hathaway's Oscar nod (and probable win).<br/><br/>Some of the other casting is also well-done, with Hugh Jackman (nominated), Samantha Barks (nominated for other awards) and Eddie Redmayne (nominated for other awards) as obvious examples. Each was able to properly portray their character with appropriate enough musical inclination to also sing their pieces well.<br/><br/>Those songs happen to be, as with many things about this movie, hit or miss. Some are fun and catchy, and others appear to be mostly expository and had a harder time sticking with me, a first time viewer/listener. I also understand that the film took quite a few liberties with the original music, editing and remixing it so that it is definitely a different interpretation of the material.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the production value for this movie is great. When the opening number started, I got pretty excited about the scale of it all. I'm also pretty fond of the movie poster, which did a great job at capturing my imagination with Cosette's almost haunting eyes. The strange thing about this big budget, large scale production is that the director spends a lot of time showing the audience very little other than the face of the person who is presently singing.<br/><br/>In Short:<br/><br/>My main complaint about Les Miserables is actually kind of strange, considering the fact that my favorite movie of the year may very well have been Cloud Atlas, but it seems like simply has too much plot to be boiled down into 2.5 hours. The only real reasons I would consider to be must- see for this particular fare would be if you're either a musical fan not familiar with the original stage production or a super fan who needs all things Les Mis. In light of that, I give it my first take-it-or-leave-it recommendation, and rated it a 6 out of 10 mostly for the efforts of Hathaway and Jackman (on whom I have a slight man crush), and the fact that having exposure to a culturally significant work such as this can do a person some good."

","Outstanding : Anne Hathaway's Fantine. Twenty minutes of screen presence at the beginning, and she hovers over the whole story until the very last frame. Her heartbreaking rendering of ""I dream a dream"" is a milestone in acting/singing. Outstanding : The bombastic soundtrack, music and lyrics altogether, splendidly performed live and re-orchestrated. Good : Chris Dickens and Melanie Oliver's editing. Especially when songs are performed by three or more protagonists. Missed opportunity : Why on earth does Hugh Jackman turn the requiem-like ""Bring him home"" into a high-pitched exercise in hysterical yelling ? Bad : Russel Crowe's Javert. His eyes and his voice play two different characters. Plus, he never really seems comfortable in his much too slim outfits. Bad : Amanda Seyfried's Cosette. Much too cheesy, she doesn't match the overall realistic approach. Awful : Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter's Thenardiers. Their slapstick duets, along with horrendous makeup, absurdly grimacing faces and graceless body language will prompt the use of the ""skip"" button of the remote when Blu-ray time comes. Awful : Tom Hooper's direction. A few exceptions aside, the endless Terry Gilliam-like tracking shots and distorted closeups not only kill the intended lyrical scope of the show and almost ruin its emotional impact, but inflict the kind of headache you can ""expect"" from an incompetently converted 3D flick."
"eemeden","1","5","12","7 April 2013"," I make music, I play music, I sing and I hate Les Miserables
","This is a provocative review and the statement here will be: If you liked the audio in the Les Miserables you are a masochist, you can't sing or you don't have ear for quality.<br/><br/>I went to movies to see Les Miserables. I like musicals. Moulin Rouge is awesome. Rock of Ages is cool and funny. Most of the animation movies have very nice tunes. There are hundreds of marvelous soundtracks and memorable themes out there: Top Gun, Gladiator, Tron: Legacy, Matrix, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings etc.<br/><br/>Now then dear reader, if you don't have ear for quality audio you should admit it. Without this talent to hear you have only your subjective way to experience music. You can't be a quality police without the magical musical ability to hear things.<br/><br/>Imagine yourself in a factory and you see a shining steel valve block made by a machinist. It's a shiny metal cube and it doesn't have any scratches or other obvious faults and you say it's a good piece. But you didn't use a dial gauge to measure the tolerances now did you? You don't even know what a dial gauge is and you don't know anything about the required tolerances. So a master machinist tells you that it's a quite poor piece but it might work adequately nevertheless, because the customer does not demand high quality.<br/><br/>Without ear for music you can't tell the difference between adequate quality and high quality most of the time and that's the honest truth. So you should probably stop trying and be happy with what you got. You can still tell what you love and what you hate, even thought the concept of quality is something you won't be able to internalize. However there are lots of people in the movie audience who are musically talented and they are able to hear the nuances in a song or a tune. Sometimes ignorance is a bliss though.<br/><br/>In Les Miserables the acting suffers because the actors clearly know they can't sing. Okay they can sing something somehow, but the don't excel in it like Celine Dion does. These actors just haven't sung enough to be perfectly comfortable with singing and it shows in the expressions during many scenes. The acting overall is pretty decent nevertheless. The setting and environment are nice. The songs and musical themes are very repetitive and boring and there is just way too much singing during this excruciating three hours. In addition the quality of singing made the movie an agonizing ear shattering nightmare experience. I was desperately sighing during the whole movie wishing they would just stop singing for at least a moment, because the miserable singing hurt my brains. The actors in the movie have quite good poker faces but I felt the overwhelming shared sense of shame while sitting in the theater.<br/><br/>The actors aren't singers. You can't be an excellent singer without at least 10 000 hours of proper practice, which means 8 hours a day, 5 days every week for 5 years. If you want to save your voice it's 10 years. You must practice a lot to excel, unless you are one of those miracle singers, which exist but they are one in a ten million literally.<br/><br/>Les Miserables is a musical so let's get some musical references so that we are able to set some standards. For example Sarah Brightman and Josh Groban (check Internetz) can sing as well as the female vocalist Ofra Haza (check Deliver Us) in The Prince of Egypt. Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey duet works pretty well (check When You Believe), even though Houston was a pure vocalist star, may she rest in peace, and Carey is just another singer who is successful for some reason. Hans Zimmer is a genius (check Gladiator soundtrack) and have made lots of fantastic music.<br/><br/>Most of the people who don't know what singing is or how to sing tend to think that Carey is a very talented singer because of her vocal range, nice tunes and success or whatever. Same people tend to think that Rihanna with her awful nasal ""high register"" faulty singing technique knows how to sing. Rihanna may produce interesting tunes but her singing is bad. Go ask an unbiased talented musician (preferably a musician who has studied classical music, not the rap artist from your hood) what he or she thinks about Carey's voice and you will hear the truth. Many of my friends in a choir can sing better than some of the fellows in the movie.<br/><br/>Maybe they tried to make it seem like the actors really sing in the environment they are in but they weren't. If you are able to hear the singing that clearly, you should also be able to hear environment effects as clearly as well, but you couldn't. It's extremely demanding and often impossible to filter the pure human voice from the environment without considerable damage to the audio quality and what would be the point of that? To detach the singing from the actual environment and make it seem less real even though the purpose of all this ""live singing"" is to make it seem real? Well it wasn't real and it didn't seem real whatever the case is.<br/><br/>Even if I am wrong about all this, which I'm not, it was pain for my ears and I hate the movie. Awful, infuriating movie theater experience.<br/><br/>The audio in Les Miserables might be a mix of live singing and studio recordings and maybe they've used a bit less obvious audio tuning and auto-tuning, but I don't believe for a second that the singing was ""live"". They should've dumped the fake live gimmicks and should've done some proper audio editing instead to make it sound good. They should've auto-tuned it like there is no tomorrow to make it all less miserable."

","Wow I had read the book years ago in high school and loved it but this made me forget why. I knew I was in trouble right from the opening scene and realized that it would be ALL and ONLY singing. Just shoot me. Really really bad singing... the only one who could sing was Samantha Barks as Eponine. She was great. Anne did a decent job I must say but I think part of my positive impression is due to the fact that her part was well contained. She didn't go on and on endlessly. I love Hugh Jackman and although his portrayal of the character and emotions was wonderful, the singing, meuh, not so much. Who convinced Russell Crowe to do this, I can't imagine. And I read a review that said that Amanada Seyfried's singing was good, SERIOUSLY?? like chalk on a board... so so awful. To bad the kids didn't have bigger parts - they were awesome!

","I don't get it.<br/><br/>For years I've seen ads, marketing campaigns, theater posters, etc., about ""Les Miz,"" and had grand ideas in my mind about what the stage production was all about. Vague ideas swirled around my mind about brave French revolutionaries fighting for freedom, with inspirational dialogue and songs to stir the human spirit.<br/><br/>Then came ""Les Miserables"" the film musical with an all-star cast. Admittedly, I was never a ""Les Miz"" groupie. I never saw the stage production. I was only familiar with one song (the ""dream"" song Anne Hathaway sang). It's the only catchy song in the entire production. So ... my opinion will not count to die-hard ""Les Miz"" fans.<br/><br/>For the rest of us: The movie was just ... meh. Honestly, the funniest moment came when the movie ended and someone in the audience said, ""Oh, thank God!"" ... With regard to performances: Hathaway's voice was a revelation. The best performances in the entire film were by the English actress Samantha Banks, and American Aaron Tveit.<br/><br/>I found the entire experience very strange. The movie was vacuous. I kept waiting for something to stir my heart and imagination, but it was like being in a whirlwind of melodrama in an alternate universe. I truly felt like a tourist going through culture shock in a strange country. I just didn't get the customs, history, or sentiments of the inhabitants. None of it made sense to me. It all seemed out of whack, and, frankly, not very sincere or compelling.<br/><br/>Are all the ""Les Miz"" fans delusional? Maybe."
"Domyo","3","5","12","25 December 2012"," Wanted to like it
","Ugh-I really wanted to like this but it was sort of painful. I didn't go expecting it to be like the Broadway rendition or other adaptations. There should have been dialogue interspersed with singing by someone who could DEVELOP the characters. Then perhaps the viewer could care about them more: e.g. Anne Hathaway was an insanely great vocalist, but I couldn't give 2 poops about ""Fantine"". Hugh Jackman was good, but ""Jean"" was a pill. Both Russell Crowe's nasalized voice and his flat, flat, flat Javert was so depressing. The Thenardiers saved me from wanting to dive into the Seine too. The 5 stars are split between Hathaway's short and underdeveloped appearance and the cinematography."

"MartinHafer","8","4","9","21 April 2013"," It's good....the play is just better.
","The movie version of ""Les Misérables"" is a hard sell to me, as I was simply blown away when I saw the play in London. I sat in the second row, center, and it just doesn't get any better than that. To this day, it's one of the best plays I have seen--and I have been to Broadway on quite a few occasions and seen many top plays. I am pretty sure that your reaction will depend, in part, on whether you've seen the play. It also didn't help with me that I've seen about a half dozen non-musical versions of the story--including the excellent 1930s French picture.<br/><br/>Apart from it simply being better in person, this style musical (without traditional lyrics and choruses you will find yourself singing later), is a hard sell to the public in general. It just doesn't work as well on film, as it loses the spectacle and emotional impact. So am I saying the film is bad? Nah. It just isn't as good--despite some very good acting, decent singing (while some reported that Russell Crowe was weak, I thought his voice just fine), lovely sets and some eye-popping cinematography. It IS a good film. I particularly liked Sacha Baron Cohen's song and dance number (get a load of the cat's tail!) but everyone seemed to try quite hard to make this film well.<br/><br/>While I could say more, I noticed that there are almost 700 reviews for this film, so I'll wrap it up and recommend the film mildly."

","Some stories seem to capture the whole of humanity in their characters. Good examples of this are Catch-22, It's a Wonderful Life, 12 Angry Men, and Les Miserables.<br/><br/>Some stories have been adapted into really good stage productions. From the above list, this includes 12 Angry Men and Les Miserables.<br/><br/>Some really good stage productions have been adapted into really good film productions. From the above list, this includes 12 Angry Men.<br/><br/>A film production of Les Miserables was attempted and released in the closing days of 2012. It has people swooning all over the world. I did not swoon.<br/><br/>It's not because I don't like musicals. Don't write me off as one of THOSE people. I love musicals. I love musicals like West Side Story, Fiddler On the Roof, Oliver!, and even the 2005 remake of The Producers. And I love the stage version of Les Miserables. I've known people who walk out on a movie when they learn it is a musical, and I don't understand them.<br/><br/>It's because the people who made Les Miserables seem to have had no idea what they were doing that I don't like it, particularly when it came to adapting blocking and visuals written for stage into something presentable on screen. To be fair, this is a tricky thing to do because it involves a lot of compromise between film-standard production techniques and more ""stagey"" aesthetic, but it's been done successfully so many times before that there's really no excuse for it.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that this film is shot really poorly. It seems like every time someone talks in this film it's in a close-up. Even more jarringly, the close-up always seems to have the subject pushed way over to one side of the screen, leaving an empty space you could park a dump truck in. Once you notice it, you can't stop noticing and it bothers you for the whole movie. When two people are talking, it's always shot-reverse-shot. Shots where interacting characters are on screen together are the exception. There's no chemistry between actors, except for the Thenardiers, who are on screen a lot together and whose scenes stand out as enjoyable for this reason. I'm reminded of Redlettermedia's discussion of Star Wars Episode III's dialogue scenes: It's boring. The way it is shot makes it almost sequential: We are shown one thing at a time. This is the complete opposite of the nature of theatre: On stage everything is always visible, and the audience is simultaneously aware of every interaction taking place at a given moment. Les Miserables was written with this property of stage in mind, don't you think something's going to get lost when you take it away? My point is, if you're going to adapt something from stage, you have to allow some of the original stage blocking to appear. Remember the scene from 12 Angry Men when Juror 10 goes on his prejudiced rant and all the other characters stand up and walk away? Is it not obvious that the blocking was lifted from the stage? Was it not a powerful moment? <br/><br/>I have my other qualms about things like casting non-singers for singing roles, and I am particularly bitter about this movie's rendition of ""I dreamed a dream"" being more acted than sung by Anne Hathaway. But I am fully aware that mainstream movies have to grab peoples' attention, and casting big names is sort of a necessity.<br/><br/>I could say I like the story and music and stuff, but that's not the movie's accomplishment, and it certainly did not pull it off in a way that was to my liking."

","France, 1800s. Convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) breaks parole after been given a second chance by a kindly bishop (Colm Wilkinson). Pursued by the police inspector Javert (Russel Crowe),Valjean tries to become a better man, adopting the daughter of a factory worker (Anne Hathaway) in the process. But revolution is in the air...<br/><br/>Within the first few minutes of Tom Hooper's film you realise this is no ordinary adaptation of a musical; the ships being pulled into harbour by the convicts under stormy skies, Crowe's obsessive inspector overseeing the action; the music dark and foreboding. This is a film that is not afraid to shy away from the poverty, from the violence. You feel every bullet, you can almost smell the sewage that Jackman must crawl through during the third act.<br/><br/>Jackman is extraordinary, and with the amount of vocals he must perform, not to mention the range he sometimes must sing (""Bring Him Home"" an obvious example), you feel as if he has to be. His emotional journey of confliction and guilt is well judged and balanced, though for a film that supposedly covers at least twenty five years he ages remarkably well. He is matched by a fantastic talented cast; Crowe, to be blunt, is not a natural singer but his performance in fact helps the film even more, for Hooper chooses to shoot his solos in intense close up and as a result he is brooding and menacing.<br/><br/>Hooper uses this trick quite a few times, most notably during ""I Dreamed A Dream"", which is one long unbroken shot. Anne Hathaway is extraordinary; she neither showboats nor shies away from the power of the song or the emotion of the character, who has been brought to her lowest by the cruelty of those around her. It is a great, awards worthy performance, and is actually missed when she is no longer around after the first act.<br/><br/>The film isn't all doom and gloom and depression, despite its title; there is welcome comic relief from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the thieving innkeepers, and a charming, sweet love section with Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne; this also involves a bewitching turn from Samantha Barks, the only member of the cast to have played their character on stage; as a result she knows her role inside out and adds a raw emotion to it.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect, sadly; it is perhaps a little too long, though fans of the stage show will notice when songs have been trimmed slightly and reworked. But all in all, it is a fantastic achievement. The last great movie musical, arguably, was Chicago, in that it found a way to convey the song and dance numbers in a believable, celluloid sense. Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is of course a worthy contender, with it's love of blood and gore helping it to stand out from the crowd; but Hooper has done the seemingly impossible and made a gorgeous film out of a show that has often been criticised for its overuse of schmaltz; this is grounded, and more to the point, realistic. It is first class filmmaking.<br/><br/>8/10"
"keyos27","5","3","6","27 January 2013"," An unnecessary long movie that could have been succinct
","In terms of genre, I am not a much of musical fan but enjoy a number of prominent films, such as ""The Sound of music"", ""Chicago"", and ""Mamma Mia!"" that consist of a well-connected interwoven between a intriguing story and endeavored combination of dancing and singing by cast who sweat themselves to master painstaking moves with sore throats. That kind of element is what I always expect when it comes to a musical film. <br/><br/>For ""Les Misérables,"" I do appreciate its bold attempt for the live performance, which means every character in the movie sings without lip-sync. The entire sequences including narrations were carried with continuous singing and individual repertoire. <br/><br/>Imagine how hard it must be for them to convert written scripts into composed lyrics? It is undeniably remarkable efforts. Just the efforts though, the result was rather dull and exaggerated. Sadly, while every cast shows a dynamic stage presence, they often wither periodically during the 158 minutes. <br/><br/>One of the reasons is it is loaded with an excessive amount of solo performances that degrad a few crucial dialgoues. For example, when Policeman, Javert encounters an escaped prisoner, Jean whom he has not seen for 8 years looks rather comical as seriousness is taken away by an off-timing and over-performed stage. <br/><br/>Another reason would be the length of an individual performance with obscure narrations. I want to condemn whoever is in charge of to showcase elongated scenes with constant close-up shots with no vibrant movements that make me yawn. It is just too repetitive to embrace the emotions and the messages in a positive way. <br/><br/>With all the biased negative aspects though, I have to admit that the colorful and traditional art of costumes and environments for 19th-century in France is beautifully depicted. The make-up artist's forte to express different types of characters brighten up the casting choice, especially the wicked Thénardier couple. It is pity that the directing rust potential and hard works of the film crews. The conscientious editing and scripting is needed to neglect negative elements<br/><br/>Or perhaps, I am an impassive person who is preoccupied with a mind of vibrant action films and creativity with no tolerance. For this reason, even it does not hurt to see the amazingly talented presentation, I would not recommend this movie to those who aren't patient enough to endure a character-driven story that is made up of mere lyrics."

","""Almost near perfect between performances and story the adaptation of the world wide smash musical is one of the best musicals of all time because it fits the formula of musicals of a past era"" <br/><br/>Musicals are very hard movies to pull off because sometimes singing can look awkward depending on who is starring in the movie and also how the movie looks. Many classic musicals have been done well but some come out as awful and laughable films. The story of Les Misérables revolves around Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) a prisoner who after 19 years being arrested leaves parole to later become a rich french man. While taking a different identity Javert (Russell Crowe) his parole officer turns up as the police in his town. While this new person Jean Valjean changes Fantine's (Anne Hathaway) life taking her child Cosette (Isabella Allen/Amanda Seyfried) into his care. Eight years later and Cosette falls in love with Marius (Eddie Redmayne) who is a student revolter who has his best friend Éponine (Samantha Barks) beside his side only feeling for Cosette while Éponine loves Marius. Many other stories happen over the years in the story but I would be here for days.<br/><br/>As a fan of movie musicals but especially of this actual musical in general (even though I have only listened to the soundtrack but not seen a stage production), I have always thought a musical of this scale belongs on screen because of the epicness of it's story but also of the long time period of the story. Tom Hooper the director of the film took the risk by having actors sing live on set which was a genius decision because the awkwardness of the musical elements is taken out because emotions are spontaneous and very natural. The continues closeups in the film even made the story much more moving with the actors solo's feeling like stories instead of ballads like they would be on stage. The film does have few flaws which include some off notes by the actors but also when spoken dialogue is spoken it felt out of place and took me out even if just one word was said compared to the many songs performed. Even with intimate closeups production values were high mixing historical french details with other details that seemed to have a fantasy quality to them. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays Jean Valjean and from start to finish he is really the story. I thought he would be perfect for the role from his casting but I came out of the film positive about his performance but compared to men (Colm Wilkinson who was in the film as The Bishop) who have played the role in the past. He was better at the very beginning and the end but the journey to those two points was strange as he seemed to get worse only to have a great conclusion to the performance. His acting was great but surprising his singing was weak for a fan of Jackman's singing voice. Anne Hathaway played the tragic Fantine and with only around 20 minutes of screen time she is heartbreaking and moving all together. Her big solo ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was the show stopper of the film and moved me to tears. All her other scenes were great to see the transformation of this character a good girl to her tragic departure. Russell Crowe played Javert and I quite enjoyed his performance and voice (not in agreement with popular opinion), the character was perfect for him and his two solos were so well done and even with some flat notes his acting performance along with his vocal talents were shocking from him because I was not expecting it. Samantha Barks plays Éponine and she has mastered this role now on screen. She benefited most from the filming style because unlike live performances she held back and that was even more heartbreaking to the character who has always been my favourite of the musical. Her solo is just as great as other solos and if given more screen time could have been the standout of the film. Eddie Redmayne played Marius and he added so much to this character who I have found so boring on stage but with his performance of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" he made me finally care about Marius through his performance. Other mentions are Amanda Seyfried bringing fresh air to the lifeless Cosette, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Caron Coen brought the comedy to the story as the Thénardiers and Aaron Tveit was also strong as Enjolras.<br/><br/>The film was everything I expected it to be from being such a fan of the musical. Strong performances from the leading cast and great visuals throughout I feel in love with this movie from the minute the music started to the emotionally satisfying music ending at the end of the movie musical.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: A+ (MVP: Anne Hathaway)"

I felt many of the actors, who I know to be fantastic singers, were understated due to poor design decisions.<br/><br/>Overall I felt having many lines half spoken in an attempt to sound more emotional and genuine failed and is where the movie as a whole fell flat for me. Also the decision to have all the singing done on set as opposed to in studio was in my opinion a poor choice.<br/><br/>In the end the movie does accurately portrait the story of Les Miserables, and is worth a watch.

Then a few years ago, I watched the 25th anniversary with Matt Lucas and Alfie Boe, I was absolutely blown away by the performance and the effort that was put into it! I wish I would've seen it in London.<br/><br/>Then I saw this movie this morning and I was extremely disappointed! Hollywood absolutely brutalized this legendary musical for people who just can't sing the right notes! Urgh why did they have to pick actors who bloody can't sing a hymn sheet?!! Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe just sounded like crows, they were terrible! With Anne Hathaway,Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne were OK singers but needed a lot of practice. I don't know how they were saying Anne Hathaway blew the audition with tears because really, I would be crying that the musical is ruined by this movie! <br/><br/>The only one that was really good was Samantha Barks, she looked and sounded like the perfect Éponine that I would listen to all day then the rest of the cast. I'm glad she was chosen because no one could play a good Eponine like her!<br/><br/>Anyways I'll be getting back to watching the live versions of this musical because Hollywood, you ruined this for me!"
"blake-portlock","6","3","7","12 January 2013"," The Good, Bad and the Ugly - A mixed bag and fanatics may well loathe it.
","The majority of user feedback given here is positive, which surprises me, given a truly mixed bag of a production - however I encourage everyone to see it.<br/><br/>Having seen the musical many times, concert version and 25th anniversary at the Barbican this had a lot to live up to, and for me a mountain too high.<br/><br/>In essence, the movie was just about saved by an emotionally charged ending and stellar performances from Hugh Jackman (negative criticism below astonishes me - did they watch the other parts?!), Samantha Barks, all of the students, Gavroche and a tiny moment of emotion for Javert placing his war cross onto Gavroches body. <br/><br/>Lets start with the Good: 1) As stated Hugh Jackman carried the whole production, and any scene with him put my mind at ease. He level of acting was spot on and vocally more than good enough to perform in a musical. 2) The sets were superb and an area where movies can really add value over the musical, which for me really shone (given average cgi - more later). 3) Jean valjeans death was one of the few parts offering more emotion than the musical and one scene where the director did not overcomplicate the choreography..a thank god for that moment sprang to mind which saved the entire film. Always have a good opening and ending..<br/><br/>And for the bad, to name but a few:- 1) Every other actor - the decision to cast actors with signing as secondary motive stood out, and only actors with vocal training held their own - Marius, Eponine, Hugh Jackman - everyone else was week. A real shame. Anne Hathway for me completely overacted I Dreamed a Dream 2) To compensate for the lack of vocal sound/emotion in voices, the orchestra was softened and at many times not even used. Some of the score is superb and we were left missing a crucial element of the musical. 3) Eddie Redeymedes bobbing - blimey! The boy can sing, but once you notice his head bobbing on vibrato its impossible to ignore. Otherwise a very solid performance. 4) CGI was weak, transitions from CGI to real scenes were noticeable. Javerts death was comical. The opening camera shot of boat in the harbour tricked me into thinking we would be seeing incredible graphics.<br/><br/>And as for the Ugly:- 1) A complete re-write of the score. So frustrating. Comments have been posted below emphasising this. Les Mis fans would easily spot this - every sentence had a change to the musical, whole songs were removed, halved in length, songs were reorded, new songs, new words - the list is endless. 2) The pace. For me a turning book over 1200 pages in length into a movie musical is tough..very tough. Trying to add new elements in to improve the flow forced the director to compromise - as stated above mainly by altering the lyrics. The stage musical has several key pauses - for example when the students die the barricade revolves..a real moment of emotion. 3) Camera work. Far too much going on, panning in, out, large face shots, motion sickness. This only worked when several actors were singing at once and offered the audiences an easier understanding of important lyrics. <br/><br/>All in all, the devil is in the detail. If one wishes to sit back and enjoy the show at a high level, they will. For Les Mis pros the significant modifications could be highly frustrating. Newcomers with an eye for musicals should love it.<br/><br/>Musical fans will readily admit the story has been simplified since the original score, and I just wonder whether such a complicated story is a bridge too far for the film world..."
"DR.Z","8","3","7","30 December 2012"," A very serviceable movie adaptation of a much-loved musical
","OK, I must admit I have seen the musical about a dozen times in various incarnations, so my standards were pretty high for the movie. Overall, I thought it delivered to my expectations.<br/><br/>Pluses: 1. The cinematography, makeup and art direction are beautiful (although as some people have said, they could have expanded the CGI budget). You definitely get a sense of the grime and poverty they were fighting against.<br/><br/>2. Ann Hathaway--I think she will get an Oscar nomination. Totally believable in the Fantine role.<br/><br/>3. Samantha Barks (who was Eponine in the London production)--best singer in the whole cast. Made even ""a Little fall of Rain"" which I normally detest bearable.<br/><br/>Minuses: 1. The actors sing during the scene--it is not an overdub. It does make for some good transmission of emotion, but Les Miz has incredible songs, and sometimes the voices sounded a little thin and reedy.<br/><br/>2. Hugh Jackman--good actor, not a great singer. He ruined ""Bring Him Home"" in my opinion. Given Colm Wilkinson was there as the Bishop of Digne you could see what a great singer could have done with the songs.<br/><br/>3. Tom Hooper (Director) sure loves his close ups. Half the time I was marveling at the magnificent dental work of some of the actors vs listening to the music.<br/><br/>In other thoughts, I thought Russell Crowe had a serviceable voice. He definitely was hired more for his menace than his singing--but he managed to deliver a passable rendition of his big (and my favorite) song, ""Stars"" without butchering it too much. And the actor who played Enjolras was miscast--he is supposed to be this tall, commanding leader and I didn't think he quite made it.<br/><br/>Again, my expectations were high--if you haven't seen the musical, or any musical, this would be a great opportunity to see if they are for you."

","This review will be given from two perspectives. The first is seeing it as an on-screen adaptation of the stage musicals. The second perspective I will give is one where we disregard the original and talk about this movie as a stand alone film.<br/><br/>OK, so here goes.<br/><br/>This is an AWFUL ADAPTATION. I am baffled when I see reviews giving this 10 stars!<br/><br/>If you play the songs side by side with their stage versions, this one is VOCALLY INFERIOR. (For those wondering why every line is sung, it's because they stayed true to the original.) I can barely hear what the characters are saying behind all those tears and sobs and whining and crying!<br/><br/>Now let's look at this movie as a movie.<br/><br/>It is a TERRIBLE MOVIE. Acting is sloppy. Camera work is disturbing.

"terrellrobinson71","10","2","4","6 April 2013"," Do You Hear the People Sing? It's about a movie for our times
","If you were one of the lucky millions of people who read Victor Hugo's ""Les Miserables"", seen the stage show and dreamed a dream for a movie musical to come to life, faithfully and truthfully, good news, life has brought you that dream you dreamed. Thanks to Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper (of ""The King's Speech""), producer Cameron Mackintosh (of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and the stage show of ""Les Miz"") and the originals of the stage show, Claude-Michel Schoenberg, Alain Boubil and Herbert Kretzmer, it finally comes to life. As a person who never seen the musicals on stage, but watched the movies based on the shows, I always imagined that something like ""Les Miserables"" would be a movie musical for our times, this is actually quite true with Occupy Wall Street and recent events that happened for the past couple of years. I'm getting too far away with this review, so perhaps I should start with this: Les Miserables is enthralling, heart-wrenching, epic, powerful, sometimes humorous, haunting and harrowing, and it is, without a doubt, the best film of 2012. In this sung-through libretto set in France, the story is about a prisoner named Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a man who spent 19 years in jail (5 for stealing a loaf of bread, 14 for trying to escape) and is recently freed, however, he is on parole thanks to Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe). Having been released and not accepted into most towns, Valjean seeks refuge from The Bishop of Digne (The original Valjean on stage, Colm Wilkinson), rewarding with food and a few of his prized possessions. Having caught an epiphany of his about living a much better life, Valjean breaks his parole and hides, only for Javert to chase after him for years. Under the new identity of Monsieur Le Mayor, Valjean crosses paths with Fantine (Anne Hathaway, who recently won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in this role), a single mom who has been working at his factory, having been recently fired for accusations of prostitution by her co-workers and her boss, in which she ends up as one. Taking her to the hospital before she kicks the bucket much later, Valjean, with Fantine's permission, vows to take care of her daughter, Cosette (young version played by Isabelle Allen, older version played by Amanda Seyfried) and rescue her from the innkeepers Thenardiers (Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen). Years and years later, Valjean remains on the run from Javert, and keeping Cosette safe. However, safe will working out just fine when Cosette falls for a young Student of the Revolution named Marius (a star-making turn by Eddie Redmayne from ""My Week with Marilyn""), who is on the crush target by his friend, Eponine (another star-making turn by Samantha Barks, who also played Eponine on stage), daughter of the Thenardiers. And of course, this is during the Rebellion of France done by The Students of the Revolution with leader Enjolras (fantastic Aaron Tveit) and little lad Gavroche (terrific Daniel Huttlestone). I won't say anything else, you just have to witness this for yourself. Les Miserables has its lovers and its haters, critically speaking of course. I know that the haters are criticizing this movie because Tom Hooper's respectable use of hand-held cameras and close-ups, thanks to cinematographer Danny Cohen. And why is Russell Crowe singing in this movie? I already know they are picking on him because of that, but I ignored them, because I salute Crowe for taking the courage to do something like this, and his performance is absolutely stunning, developing more than just a clichéd, single-minded bad guy. The lovers including me, will see this movie more than once. I would watch it again, because of not only Hooper's direction, but of him using his actors to actually sing live on-camera so that it can carry some real emotions through. For example, when Fantine is singing that oh-so-signature song ""I Dreamed a Dream"", it's in one shot, pure close-up and she pours her heart out about how her dream is ""so different from this hell I'm living"". It's one of the best scenes ever shot, and Hathaway puts Susan Boyle back in her place. The actors gives everything they got, especially Jackman and Hathaway, who definitely gives the best performances of their careers. Seyfried is heartwarming and as always, enchanting and her chemistry with Redmayne (with ""A Heart Full of Love"") is absolutely charming. Barks, who also carries Eponine's signature tune ""On My Own"", is beautifully heartbreaking. Cohen and Carter are a perfect movie couple and when they perform ""Master of the House"", it's hilarious and carries a lot of fun with that number. Note how they always pickpocketing a lot of people, while they are running their inn. And of course, I did say that Redmayne gives a star-making turn and boy, he is ingeniously good. When he belts out ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"", he knocks you out completely. I did say this is the best film of the year, because there is something about this movie makes it emotionally gripping and that is about hope. We only hope that sometimes we want our voices to be heard and how they want what's best for us, but we always have the chance to find out about the world and could maybe discover it. It may never change, but we'll never know, which quite fits this lyric: ""There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes."""
"tapio_hietamaki","9","2","4","1 March 2013"," An intense drama of human nature
","This film is a translation of a stage musical (and a French one at that), which itself is a translation of a 19th century literary classic. As such, Les Misérables is an excellent adaptation of an adaptation, and an ambitious and successful film. All dialog is delivered in singing and the film is mostly shot in close-ups, so it's an exhausting and demanding experience, but if one bears with it, the film can be very touching and rewarding.<br/><br/>The story tells of many things, as one might expect -- love (both romantic and familial,) repentance, revolution, justice. The wonderful character of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) shows how much good a human being can do if one desires.<br/><br/>There has been much complaining on Russell Crowe's vocal performance, which I don't understand at all. His voice is beautiful and he sings on key and with tremendous emotion. He shows the internal conflict of his character masterfully, even through his stoic expressions.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway's Academy Award-winning performance is certainly deserving. She's better here than anywhere before, showing extreme anguish and exuberant joy. The rest of the cast is good too, especially Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>The songs themselves are OK, only two or three of them really stick with you. Visually the film resembles a stage production and has beautiful, warm colors."
"Buddy-51","9","2","4","17 February 2013"," Well worth the wait
","The long-delayed movie version of the stage musical ""Les Miserables"" has finally arrived - and the good news is that it is well worth the wait. For the film hearkens back to those glory days when musicals were massively-scaled, big-time events, and when all involved in their making wore their hearts unashamedly on their sleeves for all to see. <br/><br/>""Les Miz"" is, of course, based on the beloved Victor Hugo novel about the hardened convict, Jean Valjean, who devotes his life to helping others after a kind bishop shows him compassion and forgiveness at the darkest moment of his life. Through the course of the story, Valjean touches the lives of many people, but none so significantly as those of Fantine, the waiflike prostitute who has fallen on desperate times, and her daughter Cosette, whom Valjean dedicates his life to raising after her mother's death. Valjean's main antagonist is Inspector Javert, an unyielding stickler for the law who has made it his life's mission to bring what he sees as a flagrant lawbreaker to justice, unmoved by all the good Valjean has done.<br/><br/>With its vast array of larger-than-life figures, its melodramatic plotting, romantic flourishes and great themes of legal vs. natural law and the possibility of personal redemption - all set against the backdrop of sweeping social injustice in 19th Century France -""Les Miz"" was obviously ideal material for composer Claude-Michel Schonberg and lyricist Alain Boublil ( with English translation by Herbert Kretzmer) to work with. In fact, so rich is the vein they're mining here that ""Les Miz"" is closer to operetta than it is to those musicals of a bygone era, with very little spoken dialogue throughout the course of the movie. And this brings us to one of the minor quibbles I have with the film and with the show as a whole.<br/><br/>For if there is a weakness to the film, it is probably the result of two factors: the inevitable difficulties inherent in trying to cram a 1200-page novel into a two-and-a-half-hour film, and the fact that the movie is entirely sung. The result of both of these limitations is that we lose some of the connective tissue that provides the characters' motivations. The story tends to move in fits and starts and lacks the cohesive flow that at least some dialogue might have provided. The constant singing also prevents the characters from engaging one another in conversation, which would help to clarify some of the finer details of the plot. For instance, we don't get a sense of why Valjean is so beloved as mayor of his town (he showed them how to manufacture jewelry more quickly and economically, thereby saving the community from ruin). We're also deprived of the intense back-and-forth struggle between Valjean and Javert for Fantine's soul. Moreover, Valjean's moment of great self-sacrifice, when he turns himself into the court to save the man falsely accused of being him, goes by so fast that many people, unfamiliar with the story, may not even understand fully what's going on there. Even worse, Cosette and Marius, the impulsive revolutionary who becomes the young girl's love interest, aren't even allowed a moment of communication before they're pledging undying devotion to one another in verse. <br/><br/>Yet, even with these flaws, ""Les Miz"" is a tremendously moving and uplifting experience, unabashed in its sentimentality. Much has been made of the fact that the singing was recorded live on set, a breakthrough that does indeed add a quality of immediacy to the production, even if the soundtrack will probably suffer in comparison to one of the many stage recordings that have been released over the decades. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway do a particularly fine job in the singing department, with only Russell Crowe as Javert failing to rise to the challenge to any appreciable extent. And there are many scenes, particularly in the second half, that are positively transporting: a poignant Hathaway nailing ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne singing ""In My Life,"" Samantha Banks as Eponine performing ""On My Own,"" Redmayne singing the heartbreaking ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,"" the whole cast joining in on ""One Day More"" (the show's homage to ""The Quintet"" from ""West Side Story""), and the chorus performing the majestic ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" which can't help but lift your heart into your throat. And indeed your heart will be lodged there through significant portions of this movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"") has directed the film largely as a succession of close-ups, which does deprive us of a sense of spatial geography from time to time but which helps to enhance the operatic nature of the piece. And, oddly for a musical, there is no choreography to speak of, just as there wasn't in the stage production. For compensation, we have Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter having the time of their professional lives portraying the campy, comic-relief villains, the Thenardiers.<br/><br/>Let's just hope that the making of ""Les Miserables,"" and the audience's clear appreciation of it, will finally bring back the old-fashioned movie musical. It's been far too long."

","This movie is incredible and it brought me through a wonderful journey of passion and sorrow . One thing I did not quite expect is they sang the whole thing... The Whole Thing which is great. Watch this movie! It tells the story well and is better then any other rendition of the book that I have ever seen. The filming is great and never loses focus on the action. As for acting it couldn't be better. The voices were beautiful and the story made me cry.(I laughed during the Titanic so that's saying something). As for it being to sad I mean come on people it's a movie called The Miserable no s*** it's going to be sad. The whole movie is just great and the story is even better. This is my favorite movie of 2012 topping Looper Skyfall and The Life of Pi."
"houghtonetet","10","2","4","3 February 2013"," Emotional tour de force
","I saw the stage production of Les Mis in Toronto in 1991 and enjoyed it hugely. My Canadian friend who took me there went with minimal make-up, saying she knew how emotional it could be. Well, there was plenty of streaming mascara that night as people were leaving the theatre, and there was even more snuffling going on all around me in the cinema this afternoon. (Including my teenaged daughter, who never cries at anything – so there is a cinematic first).<br/><br/>I will get the negatives out of the way first, there are only two - (a) Gavroche seemed to have much less of an impact in the film than he did in the play, although Daniel Huttlestone was more than competent on screen. (b) I felt that Russell Crowe is not a singer by any stretch of the imagination. I am a big fan of his and he certainly looks the part of Javert and plays him very well, but a singer? No. I had to stifle a laugh during the opening scene at the shipyard, but to be fair that was probably his weakest song.<br/><br/>Other than those minor criticisms I can safely say the film far exceeded all my expectations. The acting from all concerned was impeccable and the singing was emotional and very engaging. If Anne Hathaway does not pick up an Oscar for ""I dreamed a dream"" alone, then I really don't know what is happening at the Academy. <br/><br/>I had no complaints about the pacing or the screenplay. The barricade scenes were well executed and edited. Set design, costuming, lighting, all perfect, (although I did spot that the jar of eyeballs at the Thenardier tavern was written in English and not French! Ha!)<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman carried this film with dignity and grace and hit most of the notes very well. Samantha Barks also excelled as did Anne Hathaway giving the performance of her career. Cohen and Carter were amusing as the (much-needed) comic relief.<br/><br/>The songs were performed very well by all concerned, I found the revolutionary songs stirring and uplifting, and Cosette and Marius's duet heart-wrenching, knowing Eponyne was in the background. Very good.<br/><br/>The final 90 seconds was staggering – the vision of how the June Rebellion should have ended, as it ended in Paradise. Just magnificent.<br/><br/>Awards all round I hope – 10/10."

","Embark on cinemas most gifted with an astonishing take on a theatre vintage classic. Les Miserables breathes lasting sentiment from its audience with its range of vocal capacity, taking us through a narrative of fateful love, desire and passion. Tom Hooper's marvellous employment of toning back, purely allowing his talented cast to project themselves as if they were on the prime theatre stage itself engrosses us with a blessing of raw material that will in itself be intrinsically testing to emulate.<br/><br/>Authored by Alain Boubil and composer Claude-Michel Schonberg (with English-language libretto by Herbert Kretzmer) Les Miserables warrants its acclaim as noticeably the most projected stage piece with a mammoth following which has seen fabulous permanence. With the initial English take performed in the capital in 1985, the French revolution story has been executed internationally over 40 countries en masse 20 languages, promoting itself to a entirety of approximately 60 millions spectators. Subsequently, this has assembled a cabinet of Grammy's in their abundance, nominations for best picture at the Golden Globes and the Oscars before its premier release which is indicative of the prowess of the monumental 1862 marvel tale by Victor Hugo. Like the novel, Tom Hooper's adaptation begins in 1815 prior to the Rebellion of the Revolution in 1852. The chronicle boils down to a loving bond with a varying number of interlacing relationships that accurately define the emotion and volume set by the narrative.<br/><br/>With Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe winning the protagonist roles, Javert's (Crowe) pursuit on tracking convict and former slave Jean Valjean (Jackman) is harmonised by grandiose routines from Anne Hathaway as Fantine and Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Fantine's daughter Cosette future love. Valjean's freedom from slavery is tormented by Javert who embarks on a journey to keep tabs on the former old lag. Despite Valjean's embracing endeavour to demonstrate his value by constructing his own business, officer Javert consequentially thwarts his detainee following the liberation of dear Cosette (Isabelle Allen and then Amanda Seyfried) from her janitors, The Thenardiers, manoeuvred by the energetic Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter who offer a comedic stir in their exertion to pursue life royally through their worship for robbery and foraging.<br/><br/>Les Mis offers a wonderful transition of sentimental measures from subjugation, redemption and emancipation, which replicate the emotion seen on the theatre stage. This is merged with Hooper's change of ability by stripping back rather than being too hands on, allowing Jackman to pursue the struggles of slavery with empathy with a small child he purchases in an effort to respect an oath to former employee, the struggling Frantine. Despite Hathaway's role only lasting a third of Jackman and Crowe's, her performance truly encapsulates her ability, helping us understand the capitulation of a young mother, relieved from her factory vocation and voluntarily surrendering her body to the depressive depths of prostitution.<br/><br/>Aside the themes of oppression, salvation and liberation, accompanied by a host of period costumes and tear jerking mantras, we feel a host of religious overtones through the use of lyric and narrative. Spiritual connotations are introduced as Valjean's is in receipt his release papers following his participation in the docking of an enormous ship. He visualises the position of Christ, hoisting a timber post whilst lagging the French flag. This is also visualised upon his escape, trudging over peaks with a walking stick and frayed garments. As his future improves over time, Valjean's commitment to religion is revealed to us with small prayers, pursuing his eyes to the north in vowel to do good.<br/><br/>Hooper's preference to shoot the harmonies live as opposed to having the actors lip-sync pre-recorded versions of the songs follows the customary values of the melodic trend since the 1930s. Diamond performances from Hathaway, Redmayne and Daniel Huttlestone (as Gavroche) pilfer the picture, combining the best of the conventional and already established with the finest of the new, as though they were part of the innovative cast. The camera is truly inspiring, capturing passion with indispensable shots, shaping out the backdrop and solely absorbing the endowment of the cast, dwelling into the narrative through the lyrical manifest. It's rather magnetising and moving to see Hathaway and Redmayne giving their all by emotionally draining themselves, complete with ingredients such as quavering jowls and straining tendons. Redmayne has provided himself a great platform with his lengthened limbs to hit striking notes. He sincerely compliments Amanda Seyfried's elderly fashioned wide eyed and guiltless form, igniting true love and appealing to the spectators as an authentic princess of the screen.<br/><br/>The grand finale brings great happiness with a message of victory instead of raising the white flag following the death of the majority of the characters. Les Mis offers a message of union, pride and triumph. With every chant, every connection and revolt, Les Mis communicates to us intensely with its industrious and steadfast entertainers' charismatic take on source material that has been repeatedly performed and appreciated by the masses."

","Could you build a new life with mistakes of your past haunting you? What if you had to do it more than once? Everyone has a breaking point. What if you reached yours and had further to go?<br/><br/>Jean Valjean (portrayed by Hugh Jackman) stole bread to feed his starving family and, while serving his sentence, tried to escape. So, nineteen years after his initial incarceration, a guard known simply as Javert informs him that he is free to go. Javert (played by Russell Crowe) believes that Valjean (Jackman) is a born criminal and that he will return to jail eventually. After spending almost twenty years in prison, Valjean is unable to find work and resorts to sleeping on the street. He is taken in by a bishop and spends a night in a church. He steals the church's silver in the night and is arrested but the bishop lies to the authorities, claiming the silver was a gift, thereby facilitating Valjean's release. Valjean breaks parole and is reborn as an honest man but Javert vows to find and arrest him. Eight years after the bishop's kind act, Jean has become a factory owner and the mayor of a small town. One of his workers, Fantine (portrayed by Anne Hathaway), is exposed as an unwed mother and fired by her lecherous foreman. Fantine (Hathaway), with no other options, resorts to prostitution to support herself and send whatever she has left to her daughter Cosette. Seen arguing with a customer by the rigidly moral Javert, who is now police inspector, Fantine seems destined for imprisonment. Luckily, Valjean intervenes and brings Fantine to a hospital. Despite initial suspicions that the mayor is Valjean, Javert arrests another man he believes to be Valjean and offers the mayor his resignation. Valjean declines, exonerates the man believed to be him and goes on the run. Rather than concerning himself solely with his own freedom, Valjean seeks out the daughter of the now-deceased Fantine who is being ""cared for"" by a pair of unscrupulous innkeepers. Those innkeepers (portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) extort a large sum of money before allowing Valjean to leave with Cosette and then inform the police who are hot on his trail. Nine years later, Cosette (who has, of course, grown and is now portrayed by Amanda Seyfried) is still being cared for by Valjean and, after a chance encounter with a revolutionary, falls in love instantly. That revolutionary (Marius, portrayed by Eddie Redmayne) is the object of a one-sided crush by the daughter of Cosette's former caretakers. Her name is Eponine (played by Samantha Barks) and while she has little or no interest in politics, she joins Marius's revolution almost immediately.<br/><br/>I can go either way where musicals are concerned. I couldn't stand Chicago, but I loved Dreamgirls and eventually bought it on DVD. Also, while I'd heard of it before and knew it was a musical, my first introduction to the story of Les Miserables was a film starring Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush which altered the original story and abandoned the musical aspect. I really liked this film. All the actors in this film, to varying degrees, are competent singers. In fact, Anne Hathaway was shockingly good. What I liked better about the Liam Neeson film is that it supplied explanations. Even so, if you can appreciate musicals, you should see Les Miserables."
"patrickdafunk","7","2","4","24 January 2013"," Too Much Vibrato Hugh!
","OK! So here is my review for Les Misérables.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful modern musical movie and a great take on a true classic. I haven't seen the original real life musical in the theaters, but I can say this: Anne Hathaway HOLY SH*T! She gave the best performance ever. I will not try to spoil anything in this review.<br/><br/>The vocal performances: The performances from all the actors in this movie are good. Although, some noticeably better than others. You can really pick out the 'real' musical singers/actors and the ones that were especially trained for this movie. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman weren't the best vocally. Let me tell you why. It was obvious Crowe and Jackman were lacking in tonal reach in some of the songs. They stayed in their reach, and the results were a bit of hit and miss. Russell was in my opinion noticeably better and clearer in his singing than Jackman. But maybe this was because he had less songs to sing. Jackman on the contrary had A LOT of songs to sing for his leading roll: Jean Valjean. His song performances weren't all that good. Not bad, but just not that good. There was emotion, for sure. A lot of emotion. But acting is different than singing. When singing and acting are in harmony, you have an amazing performance, but at times there was just too much acting in Jackman's singing. His 'acting as if I am singing good"" sometimes didn't make sense at all. Sometimes he just blew out random tones he tried to sing in a sentence as a reaction to a question or conversation he is in. Very confusing from a musical point of view. Hugh mostly sang in key though, but it was all sung in melodies within his very own tonal reach which results in sometimes boring and predictable melodies. Also, he really over did the vibrato effect in his voice. It was as if there was a big bee buzzing and flying in his throat the whole time. Seriously, vibrato is a cool effect, but not constantly.<br/><br/>Now enough about Hugh's overdone vibrato, now on to the good stuff: <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway. Anne Hathaway. Anne Hathaway. She should win an award.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried sang beautifully but didn't have the pure rawness of Anna. She was perfect for her role though. <br/><br/>Sasha Cohen Baron and Bonham Carter were a good comical contrast for all the seriousness in this movie. <br/><br/>It would be stupid not to mention all the other actors. But I don't know their names because they aren't big movie stars. But let me tell you, these actors were AMAZING singers and performers. The little french revolution kid was amazing. So were all the others. <br/><br/>Lastly, it was all so EMOTIONAL! Sometimes so emotional that some people got really uncomfortable during some intimate song performances. You know it's a good performance when the cool guys before you are trying not to cry.<br/><br/>So my verdict, 7 out of 10."
"ferari-148-787413","8","2","4","23 January 2013"," A lovely interpretation of a stage show
","I went along to the movie to reminisce about my experience on and off stage and finally to see the big screen adaption of one of the best and most popular musicals of all time. Les Miserables the movie starts epically enough with the opening chain gang scene; automatically you are looking forward to how better the show will be with the huge film resources and budget! You're thinking the whole movie will be just as epically shot, but this is not so. However this is not a bad thing as Director Tom Hooper has relied on his actor's ability to act in such an emotional musical story. A lot of the movie is shot in a ""portrait style"" which lets the ""show-purists"" see the facial expressions of the characters that you wouldn't necessarily see in the back row of a performance at the theatre. At times though looking at 3 by 5 metre face gets a bit too much and you are thankful for a wide shot. On purpose the movie focuses on the big names starring in it. This means a lot of the company cameos and numbers have been either cut or shortened (this will upset the purists). Obviously this is to shorten the running time and not really needed in the screen adaption. There have also been some changes in the running order of the show's numbers but this doesn't detract from the musical and I believe fit better and makes more sense for the movie version. In some scenes the movie has gone back to the novel, this may disappoint hardcore fans of the musical if they haven't actually read the book. Unfortunately two of the casualties from the movie version are the show favourites Enjolras (Aaron Tveit) and Eponine (Samantha Barks) as both their roles have been changed albeit slightly or shortened. On the other hand Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone) and Javert (Russell Crowe) have more screen time. Don't despair Eponine fans her big number ""On my Own"" is still there and is sung beautifully, one of the highlights of the movie! Hugh Jackman (Jean Valjean) and Anne Hathaway (Fantine) performances are fantastic and deserve all the accolades they have received. It would be a travesty if Anne doesn't win the Oscar for her role. Poor Hugh unfortunately has got some serious competition from Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) to take out the Best Actor Category. I was at first a bit sceptical of Hathaway's portrayal of Fantine from the trailers but her interpretation of the role including the show-stopping ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is heart wrenching and gives you a whole new appreciation of the character that is Fantine. Jackman carries the film and does it perfectly it is unfortunate that vocally Russell Crowe's Javert is rather pathetic by comparison. Crowe is tolerable in the role as his acting talent does shine through. Vocally Crowe sounds as if he is singing from a teleprompter (very little depth or variety in his voice), but it is good that Javert has more screen time and the suicide is impressive. The supporting cast are commendable, obviously the show-stealers are still the Thernadiers, it would of been nice however to see Sacha Baron-Cohen tackle ""Dog eats Dog"" in the sewers but this show number wasn't missed in the movie. Amanda Seyfried's character, Cosette benefits from the movie adaption as does Eddie Redmayne's Marius which gives his character more depth and Redmayne's portrayal is a pleasant surprise. As usual the movie is only based on both the novel and the show. This lets Producers add scenes and music to encourage more patrons who would not normally be interested in seeing this movie musical. The movie has something for everyone as long as you can handle the 157 minutes length and the 90% of which is sung. Les Miz has action with swordfights, chases and of course the revolution. Les Miz is also epic (compared to the stage version) and very emotional, for those of you who like a cry bring tissues. The final scene is indeed a highlight of the entire movie and will leave you with Goosebumps. Depending on whether you like movie musicals, tragic story lines or your experience with the stage show you will either love it or hate it. Les Miserables the movie does not disrespect the stage show and is indeed a lovely interpretation; of which could stand alone as a memorable art form in the film genre."
"jefflouvre-435-77367","7","2","4","14 January 2013"," Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed A Dream' will bring tears to your eyes and win her an Oscar
","ANNE Hathaway's rendition of I Dreamed A Dream in director Tom Hooper's sing-through musical brought tears to my eyes. Hathaway plays seamstress-turned-prostitute Fantine in this adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1862 five-volume novel of the same name.<br/><br/>Hooper (The King's Speech) frames Fantine in this scene in a close-up and with a black background and films it without an edit. Hathaway's expression captures everything her character wants but can only dream of.<br/><br/>I dare anyone to see this scene without shedding a tear. The Academy Awards can already present the best supporting actress award to Hathaway.<br/><br/>The problem with this scene is that it raises the bar so high that everything that comes after this is a letdown. Fantine also disappears early on from this 160-minute film and reappears only at the end.<br/><br/>The interminable length doesn't help and the film could have lopped off a few songs, especially that of Russell Crowe, who plays policeman Javert, who is obsessed with hunting down petty thief Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman).<br/><br/>Perhaps the novel did a good job of explaining Javert's single-minded focus in wanting to catch Valjean, but, in the movie, he appears as a buffoon with nothing better to do than to ride all over France during the 19th century to look for a man who was convicted only for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's dying son.<br/><br/>Valjean (Jackman) consoles a beaten-up Fantine (Hathaway).A lot has been said about Hooper getting the actors to sing live during filming, and not during post-production, so this translates into greater intimacy between the actors and the audience. Viewers can really feel the actors heaving during the singing.<br/><br/>This may have worked out well for Hathaway, but, alas, not so for the rest of the actors. Crowe sings with his band, but his singing can best be described as mediocre. He also looks glum most of the time, preening in his policeman's costume.<br/><br/>Jackman is known to sing for his supper, so he handily carries most of the film. His singing is better than average and he hits all the right notes, but compared to Hathaway, he doesn't even come close.<br/><br/>Jackman's Valjean is tormented by his past. He made a vow to do right and has stuck to it since he broke his parole, changed his name and became a respectable member of society. But as singing Who Am I? twice says, he can never really run away from his origins.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter goof around.However, there's hope for him as Fantine appears to him when he's on his last breath, telling him: ""To love someone is to see the face of God."" Heck, he should have been called J.C. instead of J.V.<br/><br/>He's been carrying his burden from the moment he was set free (shown at the beginning of the film) to his very end. He was, after all, influenced by the forgiveness shown to him by the priest whose church he robbed. That was the turning point in his life.<br/><br/>He will risk life and limb during his life, fighting until the last moment to justify his second chance.<br/><br/>The story is a social critique of the unjustness of the law and the ruthlessness by which the police will pursue petty crooks, regardless of the severity of the crime and the justification for it.<br/><br/>It's also about a man who turns over new leaf but can never get rid of the vestiges of his past.<br/><br/>Valjean becomes the mayor of a small town who runs a sewing factory. For all his good intentions, he doesn't keep close tabs on his ornery and horny foreman, who abuses his position to oust Fantine.<br/><br/>After Hathaway's bravura singing, Valjean has no choice but to take care of Fantine's daughter, Cossette (Isabelle Alan, and later, Amanda Seyfried, who sang her way through Mamma Mia!) Crowe and Jackman face-off in Les MisViewers won't be swept of their feet by Seyfried's singing, but her duet with lover Marius (Eddie Redmayne) does add a romantic spark.<br/><br/>What is more interesting is Marius' friend, Eponine (Samantha Barks), who pines for him and is devastated when he falls for Cossette.<br/><br/>Her singing of her loss is heartfelt, and viewers will feel great sadness when she sacrifices herself to save Marius in the 1832 Paris rebellion.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add a touch of levity to this seriously serious musical by playing the innkeeper parents of the young Eponine.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks plays Eponine, who pines for a guy falling for someone else.The film, although immeasurably wonderful, could have done better with a tighter storyline, fewer songs and better singing from some actors.<br/><br/>www.jeffleemovies.com"

","In most musicals, they often try to glorify the settings, but I really liked in Les Miserables that they wanted it to look the actually setting of how it was in the decade that the movie is set. I believe that the t.v. show The Fugitive(1963-1967) was a little inspired off this.<br/><br/>The actors are fantastic here, Hugh Jackman really shines here, so was Russell Crowe, but Anne Hathaway really blew me away, she really felt bad for her, she gave a good acting job through singing, I hope she won't be missed by the Oscars, If she is I'll be very angry. Amanda Seyfried is alright, and Sacha Baron Cohen lightens up the movie, the moments when he comes in the film. The setting is perfect, so is the actors in there roles, this is the best film of 2012."
"elainehk-568-237187","8","2","4","30 December 2012"," Les Misérables - you might hate musicals but you will love this movie
","Les Misérables the movie finally arrived Australia on 26th Dec, 2012. I have waited long enough for this movie to be filmed. Les Misérables has been my second favorite musicals of all time since I was in high school. I watched the stage version on...probably 2007 in London.<br/><br/>Its music is striking and the story so touching yet humorous at some point. The stage version never been put on DVD, there are only the Les Misérables concert where the performers stand in front of a Mic a sing out the lines with no background settings, no movement, no acting. I love the 10th anniversary version and wish wish wish there will be a stage version on DVD someday with the dream cast - Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Philip Quast as Javert and Lea Salonga as Eponine. But I think they are all too old now to perform ha ha....never-mind, a film version is just what I'm waiting for too.<br/><br/>First looking at the cast list - Hugh Jackman as Valjean!? My first reaction was what!? Isn't he the wolf-man waving his claws around and biting people? Now he is the heroic, sophisticated Valijean!? I just could not believe it at the first place, I seriously thought Rusell Crowe is acting Valijean. Rusell Crowe is Javert, hmm, alright, nothing to complain of. Anne Hathaway as Fantine, NOW I am expecting something. Amanda Seyfried as Cossett, according to her performance in Mama Mia, I believe she will do a good job here and she just looks perfect to be Cossett. Eddie Redmayne as Maruis, not sure since I don't know him and I am just not a fan of Maruis so, I'm okay with anyone to act it. Another very important characters are Mr. and Mrs. Thenardier! They are the salt and pepper of Les Mis! I wouldn't' t doubt that Sacha and Helena would do a lousy job here. <br/><br/>Alright, so on 26th, I stepped into the Event Cinema in Sydney, excitedly holding 2 tickets that I have pre-booked almost a month ago, feeling like unwrapping a present on boxing day! When the first overture starts, my heart leaps, I feel like meeting an old friend again. The movie was very long, but I didn't feel like it. The story floated beautifully however, I could expect a little more details in between for those who never read the book or watched the musical. 3 hours passed in a flash, audiences clapped when it ends which was very unusual. I left the cinema feeling stroked, touched and I don't know...relieved. The movie surely did not film in a traditional way, the director uses lots of long shots and close-ups to capture the character emotions. And it worked! It was breathtaking when the actors are singing, it was a big thumb up for all the actors and actresses completing the song in just 1 take. It is a magical way to film this movie. However, sometimes the angle might in a weird position, for example the shot when Eddie sings his grief to his dead friend, the angle shooting Eddie's face was a bit strange. Suddenly it distracts me from grieving together with him. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie can seems a bit rush, but it also gives no room for unnecessary plot. <br/><br/>OKAY, now, Hugh Jackman singing, I used to doubt his voice. However, time proves me wrong, no, Hugh Jackman proves me wrong. If I only have to praised one person in the film, Hugh Jackman will be it. His voice is brilliant for singing Valijean, I had no idea he could sing like that, he just blown me away with his ""acting voice"". His version of Bring him home would be another classic, it is not perfect, but it delivers the emotions very well. <br/><br/>Rusell Crowe as Javert seems OKAY to me, I like his acting as I always do. However, his singing is just terrible...He looks nervous while he is singing, I can imagine he thinking ""OH no! What is the next note?"" or ""come on, I am Rusell Crowe, I cannot lose in a musical!"" But nonetheless, I still love him. Despite of his singing, his acting was great, the way he acts Javert worked well to express the reserved, rightfulness character of his. <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway sang I dream a dream well, perhaps very very well. Her version can easily be my favorite. I didn't like it at first when I heard it in the trailer, but in the movie, she sings and I see her face. Then everything makes sense. This is the emotions that I dream a dream needs to express, desperateness and fragility. Well done Anne.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried has an amazing voice and she is just the perfect actress to be Cossett. She can consider to be a part-time musical singer. :D<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne gave me surprises, I thought he IS a singer. He sang so well just like a professional. <br/><br/>I enjoyed every bit of the movie, the music, the singing, the settings. They all worked beautifully with each other and I have to give credits to Tom Hooper. He is a genius to record the sound live while they're acting, it surely gives their singing a lot more depth and emotions in it. And with all the close-ups, long shots, all the actors' emotions feel so real to me. I would rate this movie 8/10 and it easily becomes my best movie in 2012. I just need to wait and see if Life of Pi can beat it or not.<br/><br/>(From My Blog : http://elaine11231123.blogspot.com.au/)"
"lhhung_himself","10","2","4","26 December 2012"," A fantastic Fantine...
","Great musicals are all about magical moments. <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway has THE moment with her performance as Fantine. Her rendition of ""I dreamed a dream"" is how songs are meant to be sung. It's not about pitch perfect notes but about communicating passion and emotion. I don't hear the music - I feel the pain, the sadness, the anger, and yet some remaining remnant of hope. I am still moved to tears just thinking about it. It is an experience - not a performance - Hathaway doesn't just become Fantine but makes me become her.<br/><br/>The rest was middling (Cohen, Syfried, Crowe ) to very good (Jackman). I enjoyed the musical immensely and so did the audience at the theater we were at which burst into applause at the credits. <br/><br/>However, it was Hathaway, who was on screen may 10-15 minutes total, who stole the show - and was one of those rare magical moments that people remember decades later..."
"l-hudson88","10","2","4","26 December 2012"," Breathtakingly beautiful - movie of the year
","What an absolutely breathtaking film! I've never been into plays, yet after seeing the trailer for this movie, Anne Hathaway stole my heart away with her voice. Listening to her sing in this movie...her performance deserves a multitude of awards!!! The entire movie was an emotional roller coaster that made you feel so many emotions these characters were portraying. Not to mention the story line makes you realize how horrific their lives were in the early 1800's. By far, one of the best movies I've seen. Truly will make you think about life, love and the pursuit of freedom and happiness. My only complaint would be that Anne Hathaway wasn't in the movie enough. She was THAT good. Hugh Jackman managed to play by far, one of the most dynamic characters I've ever seen in a movie. His physical transformation over the course of the movie was beautifully done. Every single character in this movie touched upon my emotions in such a unique way, I'd recommend this to anyone."
"explorer801","10","2","4","26 December 2012"," A dream cast & director make a modern day masterpiece
","After much anticipation, Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"" is finally here. And let me say, it's the best musical adaptation since 2002's Best Picture winner ""Chicago"".<br/><br/>To call ""Les Miserables"" brutal is an understatement. It actually makes me feel grateful to have not lived in such a filthy time full of disease, prostitution, ruthless war, and utter disgust. To find true glory, hope, and heart amongst this backdrop is miraculous, but it is one of the most uplifting films you will ever see.<br/><br/>Having seen the stage production several times, I decided going in that I would not compare the two, and I did not. They stand alone as two fantastic labors of love. One thing I truly admired about this film is that the singing was not prerecorded & lip-synced. What you hear in the film is the actors actually singing in real time and it added so much more depth and emotion to the songs. I found it to be a bold & brave move by director Tom Hooper (who won the Best Director Oscar for ""The King's Speech""). ""Les Miserables"" actually tops his former film with passion & artistry.<br/><br/>Most are familiar with the story but it tells the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a paroled prisoner in the 1800s that over the course of decades, attempts to find redemption while a police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) pursues him relentlessly.<br/><br/>As for the cast, all I can say is I was astonished. They could not have found a better John Valjean than Hugh Jackman. His acting is top-notch & his vocal range is magnificent & surprising. Anne Hathaway steals the first quarter of the movie in her mesmerizing portrayal of Fantine. Her rendition of the song ""I Dreamed A Dream"" is anguishing,heartbreaking,& desperate. She lost nearly 15-pounds for the role,cut her hair off, and vocally prepared for weeks. Hathaway doesn't just act like Fantine; she becomes her, with blood, sweat, tears, talent,voice, and art. It's her best turn since ""Rachel Getting Married"" (2008).I'm sure both Jackman & Hathaway will receive Oscar nominations if not wins (for Hathaway in particular).<br/><br/>The Thenardier's are fun (played over-the-top by Sasha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter). Amanda Seyfried was a fantastic choice for Cosette, and the entire cast is a dream, really.<br/><br/>Then there's Marius played by Eddie Redmayne (who I also think is Oscar worthy here). He comes out of nowhere & gives this astonishing performance, singing like a Broadway God. I was blown away. His performance of ""Empty Chairs At Empty Tables"" is agonizing, and perhaps the best I've ever heard it performed.<br/><br/>The only tiny downfall to the cast is Russell Crowe's Javert. Crowe does not sing quite as well as the rest of the cast. His vocals are not as powerful. Javert is such a powerful character, and it seemed to need a bit of a punch. Still Crowe's acting is great as always & he gives us haunting insight into Javert, who ultimately is as much a victim as anyone else in the story.<br/><br/>This is a massive production. I can't recall such a huge Broadway adaptation since ""Evita"" in 1996. Some have called it bombastic. I completely disagree. Director Tom Hooper has remained faithful to the Broadway production while somehow making this adaptation his own at the same time. There are many intricacies that could never be noticed on the stage. He has directed his fine team of actors in such a way that through the gritty, raw cruelness of the time we feel uplifted. The movie is incredibly intimate. I can't imagine anyone walking away unaffected.<br/><br/>It's a movie of the heart. It's message of love, hope, giving, & surviving are inspirational & uplifting. Without a doubt, the best movie of 2012. It does not disappoint & is a definite must-see."

","Les Misérables has always remained one of my favourite musicals of all time, and upon hearing that there was a movie adaptation of it, I was very elated. Les misérables is notoriously known for one of the hardest productions to put on in any theatres, for you need a very large and enthusiastic ensemble cast, as well as a massive set, and beautiful singers. This movie, while the best stage-to-screen version, has some roles miscast. It seems as if Tom Hooper wanted the voices from their acting chops and not from their singing. A lot of actors steal the show with their powerhouse voices, but the rest sometimes just miss the mark in this adaptation.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1815, inside of a french prison (""Look Down""). Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a prisoner is called towards Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe), who frees him from his 19-year sentence for stealing a loaf of bread. Valjean walks away a free man, and he stays the night at a bishop's house, where he attempts to steal a piece of silverware, but when the police find Valjean, the bishop claims it was a gift (""The Bishop""). Valjean walks away, elated of his new found freedom and trust with people to come (""Valjeans Sililoquy"").<br/><br/>Eight years later, Valjean is a announced factory owner. Amongst his workers is a woman named Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who is tormented by her fellow workers for giving her paychecks to her childs godparents (""At The End Of The Day""). She is fired and becomes a prostitute to continue to pay for her daughters safety (""Lovely Ladies/I Dreamed A Dream""). Valjean finds Fantine, moments before succumbing to her tuberculosis, and she tells him the location of her daughter, Cosette. After her death, Javert finds Valjean and threatens his life, but accidentally announces that he is from the same finanical state of Javert (""The Confrontation""). Valjean escapes and finds Cosette sweeping at the Thenadiérs bar (""Castle On A Cloud/Master of the House""). Valjean rescues Cosette and they flee to Paris.<br/><br/>Nine years later, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), now grown up, goes to a courtyard to shop, where she meets Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and Eponine (Samantha Barks). Marius instantly falls in love with Cosette, which makes Eponine jealous, as Eponine has loved Marius since they were kids. Marius goes to join his friends, led by Enjorlas (Aaron Tveit), as they prepare to start the student war (""Red And Black/Stars""). Later that night, Marius stands at Cosette's gate, while Eponine grows furious with rage (""A Heart Full of Love/In My Life""). Alone, Eponine stands in an alleyway alone, heartbroken (""On My Own""). Upon learning about Marius and Cosette, Valjean states it is not safe in france anymore and attempts to move to England. Cosette writes Marius a love letter, which Eponine hides from him. The students get prepared to fight as Javert and his army get ready to fight against them (""One Day More"").<br/><br/>The students begin to build a barricade to protect themselves (""Do You Hear The People Sing""). The start of the battle is very quiet, until someone accidentaly fires a bullet at the opposing army. Valjean, seeing it is too late to move, joins the students in their revolution. During their first battle, a guard attempts to snipe Marius. Eponine, noticing this, puts the snipers gun towards her heart, where she is shot. As the soldiers cool down for the night, Marius finds a dying Eponine. Eponine gives Marius the letter and dies in his arms, confessing his love for him (""A Little Fall of Rain""). That night, Javert disguises himself as a fellow student, but both Valjean and Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone), the youngest member of the students, notice his face and berade him of his actions.<br/><br/>The next morning, the soldiers return to the barricade. Gavroche attempts to climb a blown ashpile to grab ammo, but is shot to death. Gavroche's father, finds him dead and cries, giving away the students location. The soldiers kill the rest of the students, including Enjorlas. Marius is shot, but Valjean finds him and rescues him by taking him to hide in the sewers. Monsieur Thenadier (Sacha Baron Cohen) steals their jewelry. That night, Valjean prays for Marius' full recovery (""Bring Him Home""), but Javert finds him. Valjean ignores Javert's morales, and Javert finds himself standing at the edge of a tower, realizing that the law is not always the correct way. Javert jumps off of the tower to his death (""Javert's Suicide""), as the war ends. Cosette and Marius are wed, but Valjean does not attend the wedding. They find him in a covent, minutes from death of old age and they say their goodbyes. In the afterlife, Fantine grabs Valjeans hand and takes him to the rest of the deceased souls (""Do You Hear The People Sing (Reprise)/Finale"").<br/><br/>Les Misérables (2012) is nothing short of a masterpiece in direction. Tom Hoopers story telling, even through song which often at times does not translate well, works so organically. However, the films downfall lies in its stunt casting, and the one i am calling out Russel Crowe and Eddie Redmayne. Both do a phenomenal job with their character work, but their singing is just not there (This is very evident in Javert's ""Stars"" and Marius' ""Empty Chairs At Empty Tables""). The movie succeeds in its smaller characters, the ones that made sure you did not forget their performance. The two that really stood out were Anne Hathaway as Fantine and Samantha Barks as Eponine. Anne Hathaway won an oscar for her potrayal of Fantine and you can see how amazing of a job she did. I had never heard of Barks before this movie and now I follow her journey, just because I know how talented she truly is.<br/><br/>Overall, Les Miserables gets a 8.4/10"

","Adapted from the novel of the same name published by French writer Victor Hugo in 1862, with the same name musical as the plot reference. The story took place in France in the 19th century. Poor farmer Jean Valjean was imprisoned for years for stealing bread. He was eventually released on parole and ignored the law again. He had to escape. After being influenced by his bishop, Jean Valjean was determined to start a new life. Ten years later, he became a successful businessman and became the chief of public, but has been pursued relentlessly by the police officer Javier.<br/><br/>
The play is based on the revolution that took place in 1832. The protagonist Ran Agen is the representative of the common people; in order to feed the widowed sister and seven children, he worked day and night, and the meager income he received did not even fill his family's stomach. In desperation, in order to feed his sister's children, he chose to steal, but he was caught on the spot when he stolen bread for the first time. He was imprisoned and sentenced to 19 years in prison.<br/><br/>
The cruel life squeezed out all the kindness and sincerity in him, and he became lonely, indifferent, hatred for all existence in this tragic society. After his sentence was released, he was still not accepted by the society, and he encountered contempt and injustice everywhere, which further deepened his hatred of society. Just when he was desperate, he met Archbishop Miriam who changed his destiny.<br/><br/>
The archbishop respected him, had dinner with him, and prepared a clean bed for him to rest, but he learned hard to change, stealing again and preparing to escape. To his surprise, when he was caught on the spot, Archbishop Miriam actually proved to the police that the items were given to Ran Agen himself.<br/><br/>
Ten years later, Ran Agen was already a well-known ""entrepreneur"" in Weigao City, and was elected mayor, renamed Madeleine.<br/><br/>The policeman who used to be the supervisor of Ran Agen is now sent to Chave, the inspector of Weigao City. When he saw Ran Argen carrying the heavy axle with his shoulders and rescued the old worker who was crushed underneath the car, Chavi felt that the mayor with amazing strength seemed to escape from the prison in the past. Ran Agen. Of course Ran Ajan knew that Chave had been hunting him. He took a lot of cash from the bank that night and took advantage of the dark night to come to a big tree and bury all the cash under the tree.<br/><br/>
Chavey wants to make a thorough survey of the population of Weigao City to see the background of some people in the past decade and whether they have done any bad things in the past. According to Chave's theoretical logic, good and bad people are born with each other, and the wolf in sheep's clothing is still a wolf. Ran Agen disagrees with his opinion that this is all harm and no benefit. Even if the crime was originally committed, it may be rehabilitated now. Moving here is not to escape sin but to live a new life . Chave believes that the habits of the bad guys are difficult to change, and it is only a fantasy to rehabilitate. He refused to be the mayor, and at the Paris police station he told the chief that he was determined to expose the mayor. The director couldn't persuade Chavey.<br/><br/>
In the factory he owns, there is a single mother named Fang Ting. Because she refused to succumb to the harassment of the factory manager, her unmarried pregnancies and illegitimate children were exposed maliciously. Fang Ting was expelled from the factory under the broad vision. In order to raise the daughter fostered in the hotel, Fang Ting sold her beautiful blonde hair and sold her teeth to meet the insatiable demands of the hotel owner. Finally, she became a prostitute. On a cold winter night, Fang Ting developed pneumonia, but she could only insist on picking up guests for her daughter.<br/><br/>
One night, Fang Ting was arrested by the newly appointed Inspector-General for resisting the unreasonable demands of the prostitute, and was imprisoned for six months. At this time, Ran Agen came to the prison and Fang Ting spit at him because it was Ran Agen Fired her squid, Ran Argen was not angry because of this, Ran Argen used the mayor's power, and removed Chavi's post, which released Fantine. In this way, Chavey hated the mayor even more in his heart, and he had to find out what happened. But Fang Ting fell ill in prison.<br/><br/>
Because the police caught a criminal named Ran Agen, who was in court and three witnesses confirmed that the criminal was Ran Agen. But Ran Ajan, who was listening in court, was tortured, and he couldn't stand it anymore. He didn't want to let an innocent person suffer for himself, and finally he left out that he was the real Ran Agen. The judge also frowned, and he did not believe that the mayor was a former criminal, and comforted him by saying: You are very kind, but you don't have to bear such a big crime. Neither of them believed his statement. Ran Argen only had a big step out of the court to deal with a more important matter.<br/><br/>
Chave received the handwriting sent by the Paris police station, saying that the mayor was the former Jean Jean Jean, so he immediately got up and arrested him. At this time, Ran Argen was rushing to Fantine's hospital bed to make a final farewell with her and promised to pick up her daughter Corsette. Chavi rushed in, determined to grab the dying Fantine to jail, and Fantine vomited blood and died in panic.<br/><br/>When Chavi handcuffed the mayor, Ran Argen counterattacked and slammed Chavi's head against the wall, knocking him out. Just when the audience thought that Ran Argen could escape, another policeman at the door stopped him with a gun, but unexpectedly, the policeman was a good man, and the mayor was released again. Ran Argen poached the money buried under the big tree and hurriedly rushed in a carriage, while the awakened Chavi was chased with the police, and Chavi finally caught up with Ran Argen and pointed his gun. His forehead said: ""Ran Agen, you have been arrested."" When the man turned his head to look, it was not Ran Agen, but a farmer who put goose. Halfway along, Ran Agen swapped the roles with the goose thrower and confused Chavi.<br/><br/>
Ran Agen picked up Fantine 's daughter and fled to a monastery in Paris, but it was closed at night, and there were sentries to check documents. Only climbing up the city wall and jumping down, but with a child climbing the city wall is disturbing and uneasy, and there are soldiers constantly patrolling under the wall, it seems that Ran Agen really is a bit difficult to fly this time. But in the end, he jumped directly from the city wall to the roof of the monastery. Chave suspected that Jean Argen had entered the monastery, but it was not easy to forcibly search, because the nuns would wake up and scream. The old gardener ventured the next day to load Ran Argen into the coffin and transported it out of the monastery. He almost buried him alive because of a mistake. After ten years, Cosette had grown up, and they again buried their surnames. The monastery arranged to live in a villa in the city.<br/><br/>
Because Cosette did not want to go back to the monastery as a nun, and wanted to go out and feel the outside world freely, but Ran Agen knew that life in the city might mean being arrested again, but it was not clear. Especially when Corset loves the street speaker Maris and wants to go out to date him, Jean Argen said in an orderly tone: I am your father, and you are not allowed to do this. Cosette retorted: You control me so tightly, I know you are lonely, do you want me to stay with you for a lonely life? Then, Cosette insisted on going out to date Maris, and the two snuggled to express their affection for each other. Maris had been spotted by a spy from Chavey. Chavi broke into the door of the villa and wanted to tell the father that your daughter was deceived by the militants. At this time, Jean Argen, who was drinking coffee in the garden, panicked and asked her daughter to send Chave away, saying that his father had gone out. After Chavi left, Ran Argen couldn't help but slapped his daughter. The daughter sneered: You are scared, hide, and lie, but you want me to tell the truth if you have a date. Why? Ran Agen had to tell the truth, saying that he was not her father, but a criminal who was being pursued. ""I did steal things, especially the happy time with you.""<br/><br/>
Chave finally knew that Cosette's father was Ran Agen, who was like a chicken blood, and began to hunt again, Ran Agen began to escape again. But a revolutionary riot happened, and the revolutionaries grabbed Chavi and bound him in a humble room, and wanted to execute him. Without wanting to let his blood splash in the room, he decided to pull it out of the house and execute it. At this time, Ran Argen said: Let me come, and bring out a knife to approach Chavi. Instead of stabbing Chave, Ran Agen cut the rope that tied his hands with a knife and let him go, because grace and kindness made Ran Agen make this decision. With the assistance of other police, Chavi, who was released, continued to arrest the revolutionaries and suddenly found that Ran Agen was helping to transfer the wounded, so he arrested Ran Agen. Chave faced the white river and quickly wrote something in his notebook. Struggling in his heart, thinking hard, he finally understood the meaning of love and goodness, and understood that ""the sky is wider than the sea and the mind is wider than the sky."" So he let Ran Agen, handcuffed himself, jumped into the river. At this time, the pigeons took off in groups, and the sun still rose."

"Kage411","9","0","0","25 September 2016"," A humble opinion on a grand production...
","It's only right to say that I have not had the privilege of watching the Broadway play, of reading the novel by Victor Hugo, and of watching the 1998 movie version. Still, let me say this:<br/><br/>I loved it. So very much.<br/><br/>What should first be acknowledged of course is the source material. Victor Hugo is unquestionably a masterful writer to have written such a compelling tale of love, sacrifice, redemption, and revolution.<br/><br/>How much better can it get?<br/><br/>We were supposed to watch this adaptation in class, due to our teacher's absence. However, she did not leave a copy, and instead, opted to have us answer a few questions in our book, and a chart concerning the character traits of Jean Valjean over the years. And yet, it came to me that I was writing about a character I knew nothing about other than what little was spoonfed to us from our English textbook - who exactly was Jean Valjean? Police Inspector Javert? Fantine? What message did the author want to convey upon writing about a common man in 17th century Paris?<br/><br/>To be honest, this is my third attempt in watching this adaptation of Les Miserables (two of which were when I was about a year younger than I am now - and both failed attempts, at that). Aside from my English class, I needed stress relief from other projects.<br/><br/>I do not regret picking this up again. And I never will.<br/><br/>This adaptation was such a pleasure to watch as an introduction to one of the greatest works in literature, a literal classic. It succeeds in evoking the emotion needed to fully enjoy Victor Hugo's maelstrom: it succeeds in showing the raw cruelty of those impoverished times. It succeeds in making you grit your teeth because life is so, so unfair, and there are many who suffer because of it.<br/><br/>Those who have read the novel have stated that this is the more emotional version, by far, when compared to the 1998 version, because it truly gets the characters' intentions across (and apparently, the 1998 version strays from the characters of the source material). If these are the characters in their true forms - then I can ask for nothing more, because these characters took my breath away. Jean Valjean's conflict with the past that continuously haunts him and the man that he has become, Cosette's curiosity and love for her father (and vice versa), Marius' devotion to his cause and what he felt for all that he lost because of it, Fantine's living hell, Eponine's unrequited love and selflessness, and Inspector Javert's conflict regarding justice and mercy.<br/><br/>I found myself so immersed into the story, because it was one that gradually consumed me in heart and mind. What was this irony, wherein only death would put an end to Jean Valjean's suffering, offering him mercy in times when many else started walking into the light, all the fruit of his efforts to love and to repent and to begin anew? It was clear that he was no longer the man that he used to be, yet he was driven to an end that he did not deserve because people branded him for what he HAD done (and even then, it was to feed his sister's seven children!). I found myself asking what Javert must have asked himself, looking down at the world he would soon part with. (""Look down, look down,"" the voices sung.) Was justice a truth, or an ideal pursued blindly? Could all things be encompassed by the law? Questioning all he believed, he too, ended his life.<br/><br/>It was all very, very emotional. The bent backs of the slaves, Jean Valjean's turmoil. (""Who am I?"") Fantine, losing what little she had, reaching out for Cosette as she lay dying, no longer living after being assured that the ONLY thing she lived for was in good hands. Eponine, dying in the arms of the only man she ever loved, asking nothing more than to be glanced at by him. To be his heaven, and his only one. Gavroche, walking towards the soldiers, believing in what they fought for, then reaching his untimely end. Enjolras, a brave soul that died for his countrymen and a good friend to all he knew. Marius, waking up to the aftermath, finding that all his friends he had laughed with were gone. Cosette telling him that they would never be apart, and that he still had her. Marius, telling Cosette that they would never be apart during Jean Valjean's dying moments - Jean Valjean's last moments which were spent thinking about Cosette, and only Cosette (thus, Fantine's appearance near the end).<br/><br/>It was all very tragic, but at the same time hopeful. Les Miserables will no doubt always hold a special place in my heart. A tale of kindness repaid with kindness, bravery and strength, and most importantly, light in a time of darkness, all coupled with stellar performances and beautiful cinematography in this splendid adaptation of this timeless classic."

","This film tells the story of Jean Valjean, a man condemned to hard labor for stealing food when he was hungry. After breaking parole, he will settle down with another name, but the goodness that he feels will compel him to take a child to look after, the daughter of a woman who couldn't help. Directed by Tom Hooper, the film has a screenplay written by William Nicholson and other helpers, based on the homonymous story of Victor Hugo. The cast is headed by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and Sacha Baron Cohen, among other actors.<br/><br/>The story of this film needs no introduction. This is one of the most famous novels of Victor Hugo, already adapted to the cinema, theater and also musical theater. In fact, most of the songs the film features are, in fact, taken from the stage musical. So, more than a film adaptation of a book, this is a film adaptation of a musical play.<br/><br/>No criticisms to make about the script: he convincingly adapts the story, preserving the magic of music. The actors are huge monsters of talent with excellent voices. Jackman gave a pure soul to his character, contrasting with the vocal gravity of Russell Crowe, who gave body to Javert, a man obsessed with the punishment of criminals and disbelieving in their rehabilitation. They're strong characters, played by seasoned actors with a huge presence on scene. The action scenes between them are breathtaking. Anne Hathaway also deserves a special mention, not only by the physical effort she felt to become Fantine (she became extremely thin and almost bald for the role), but mainly by the quality of what she could do. Staying with one of the most dramatic characters in the film, she played some of the most tragic scenes, and singed their saddest song, ""I Dreamed A Dream"". Its impossible not to cry watching these scenes and listening to the wonderful way the actress managed to sing that song and give a soul, almost martyr, to her character.<br/><br/>The scenarios are excellent and try to be faithful to the book and the story. The costumes too, and some of them deserve applause, portraying fairly the misery when the poorest lived. The visual effects fulfill their role discreetly but efficiently, and the soundtrack probably will be remembered by all who are watching this movie. Winner of three Oscars (Best Supporting Actress, Best Characterization, Best Editing and Sound Mixing), this is a film for the family and for everyone."

","I don't remember when I found out about Les Misérables was being made into a film but I recall being fairly excited. I was just coming into the world of musicals and this would be one of the first I properly became invested in. Upon watching the film I found it quite upsetting (which was to be expected, of course), though I'm sure the proper term is uplifting as we do know the outcome of the French Revolution. The acting on Jackman's part was acceptable and carried the film throughout the plot, as well as his impeccable singing which by all measures made him a perfect casting choice. After its release many people criticised Crowe's singing voice however I feel that his portrayal of the morally tormented police inspector far outweighed the sour notes he may have displayed. By far the most enjoyable part of the film was the relationship between Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen's characters, the Thénardiers who lightened the mood on the mostly saddened tone the film expresses. When it comes to criticisms I have for the film I have two main worries, one of which is Amanda Seyfried who (based partly on my views on her due to previous movies) failed, I believe, to match the standard the rest of the ensemble managed to uphold. This, unfortunately, left a rather distressing amount of emotional aspects unexplored. The other concern I hold for the film is its reliance on the singing-on-set technique which, I'm sure, encouraged many of it's viewers to witness. This left the film without any other unique strategies and made it lose heart when the film- making is considered. However, Redmayne, Barks and Tveit shone throughout the piece and pulled the slightly disjointed plot into an amalgamation of emotion, drama and song."
"JosephPezzuto","7","0","0","30 June 2015"," Reel Look: Les Misérables
","""I dreamed a dream in time gone by, when hope was high and life worth living..."" Based on Victor Hugo's epic eponymous French historical 1862 novel, and adapting the beloved songs of the said film from the Broadway smash-hit by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil of which debuted in 1980, Tom Hooper's (The King's Speech) triumphant romantic musical period drama 'Les Misérables' opened on Christmas Day 2012. With a budget of $61 million, the film would eventually but deservedly win three Academy Awards and three Golden Globes and gross a worldwide total of $441 million plus. To the English-speaking world, the book's title is referred to in its original French, while several alternatives, however, have been used as well, including 'The Miserable', The Wretched', 'The Miserable Ones' and 'The Wretched Poor'among others. So does this beautiful and breathtaking blockbuster, a musical feast for the eyes and ears,possibly then remain unsung? Let's take a look. <br/><br/>The film begins in 1815 and continues on to culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, following the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict 24601 or Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and his experience of redemption near the film's end, as he is about to die in a church, questioning his own life's morals and choices. The film also adapts many natures from the novel as well, examining the nature of law and grace, elaborating the history of France, Paris' then urban design, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion and exploring the nature of romantic and familial love. <br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of 19th-century France, 'Les Mis' opens with Jean Valjean, a Frenchman released on parole after serving nineteen years at Toulan Prison for stealing a loaf of bread for his starving family (originally it was five years but the sentence was elongated due to his running away). Eight years later, he becomes a factory owner and mayor of Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais, adopting Cosette (eventually Amanda Seyfried) from living with the Thénardier twosome (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter), an unscrupulous pair of swindling innkeepers, and their daughter Éponine (eventually Samantha Barks). Cosette is the daughter of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), one of his struggling establishment workers-turned-prostitute, of whom was trying to raise money for her ill child. All the while and for decades now, ValJean is pursued by the ruthless police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe), devoting his entire life to incarcerating ValJean once again in shackles with the chain gang. Nine years later, poverty increases in Paris, and Jean Maximilien Lamarque is the only government official sympathetic towards the poor, thus causing a group of young revolutionary students, known as the Friends of the ABC, to plan a rebellion of the French monarchy. One of them, Marius Pontmercy (Eddie Redmayne) falls for the fair and beautiful Cosette, where, unbeknownst to them singing at her gate together, Éponine watches secretly in the shadows, also yearning for his love in return but realizing it was never meant to be. Once the rebellion commences, this leads up to the climactic and powerful fight for freedom, as all the souls shot down in the battle are reunited and sing triumphantly at the holy barricade on the other side and waving the French tricolor victoriously before the end credits roll. <br/><br/>'Les Mis' is no doubt a magnificent feat for director Tom Hooper, along with cast and crew. The film boasts fifty-one songs in total, as most of the numbers are phenomenal as each note is sung with a longing passion straight from the depths of the human spirit, including: ""I Dreamed a Dream"", ""Suddenly"", ""One Day More"", ""On My Own"", ""Red and Black"" and ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" Every single song was recorded live on set to capture the spontaneity of the performances, and the actors wore ear pieces which fed the sound of a live piano being played off-stage to keep their singing in key. Hugh Jackman even went thirty-six hours without water, causing him to lose water weight in his checks and eyes, allowing him to display the gaut appearance of a prisoner, and Anne Hathaway's performance at audition reportedly blew everyone away, leaving them in tears and eventually winning her an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Originally aiming for a four-hour running time (as compared to the 1934 film) and fifteen minutes of battle sequence, the film was cut to two and a half hours with fifteen minutes of the final film was cut out. 'Les Mis' was the first film in a decade to win an Academy Award nomination since 'Chicago' (2002). Critics had their own say afterwards, leaving a C plus rating as one sites' consensus reads: ""Impeccably mounted but occasionally bombastic, Les Misérables largely succeeds thanks to bravura performances from its distinguished cast."" Danny Cohen's cinematography made a point in 'The King's Speech' showing the awkward relationship between England's Prince Albert ""Bertie"" (Colin Firth) and speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) upon their first meeting, whereas here in 'Les Mis', for some scenes, the camera-work repeats this for no reason, where other times the camera jerks about wildly, allowing many pivotal moments to become lazy and unfocused. Even though the actors are giving there all during their numbers, a handful can really sing while others fall short of those of whom can.<br/><br/>Many adaptations of the film had followed throughout the years, including the more highly-praised 1935 film starring Fredric March and Charles Laughton, and the 1998 version starring Liam Neeson. However this newest installment, with its powerful performance and its demanding to be seen on the big screen will ultimately move you in some form due to its powerful impact regarding the inner pangs of squelched dreams, unrequited love and sacrifice exemplified here as a timeless testament to the survival of the human spirit to live on for one day more."

","Lés Miserables turned out to be one of the best musical dramas that I have seen in years (I am not a big fan of the high school musical series) and the praise that this film getting is what it truly deserves. The Movie follows the story of a thief, Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman),who finds redemption after he is left dubious about his ideas of hate and love by an act of kindness. Everything about him changes and he decides to be a man of good for once,while he is being dogged by the police officer, Javert( Russel Crowe), who believes that criminals are always criminals(he claims to have been born in prison but he is not one). The rest of the story is how Jean becomes responsible for Fantine's (Anne Hathaway) death and pledges to raise her daughter while being chased by the justice maniac Javert amidst the dawn of the French revolution. When he finds out that his adopted daughter Cosette (Amanda loop Sayfried) is in love with a young rebel named Marius (Eddie Redmayne), Jean must decide what to do. The whole atmosphere of the French Revolution is really immersive and actually pulls you into feeling the tension that exist between the rich and the poor. Tom Hooper has brought out a perfect looking movie that is truly a spectacle to watch. Here and there a few problems creep up,one which I felt was the length of the film and some of the dialogues(songs I mean) felt a little stretched. Despite these tiny annoyances, this film keeps your attention through it's beautiful visual story telling and terrific performances by its cast. Even when the songs get a little tiring their performances drive it to the finishing line. Some aspects of the movie like the love triangle( sort of ) between Cosette, Marius and Époine ( Samantha Barks) didn't get the seriousness that it was trying to portray and I felt Époine lamenting about lost love fell on deaf ears. Also the Thénaedier couple got a bit more screen time than what they needed. But other than that the movie is brilliant to watch.Hugh Jackman , Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway nail it. Especially Anne Hathaway's performance screams for an Oscar. Even little Cosette shines a symbol of innocence and truth amidst the social decay of France. It the actors who stand out remarkably in the film and by far I believe that it is one of the best chosen cast. This is a movie that every movie lover should watch. So get ready for a lifetime of Fight, Dream, Hope and Love."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","10 March 2015"," Imperfect yet powerful adaptation
","Les Misérables is one of those huge stories that are hard to adapt into any other format other than a novel. It spans years and years, following the life of one Jean Valjean, a released prisoner that vows to turn his life around, while at the same time one of the French Revolutions is about to begin. Its themes are massive and not easily explored, given the time constraint. Add the fact that this is not an adaptation of the novel, per se, but rather an adaptation of the world famous musical based on the book. So it's pretty easy to say that the deck was heavily set against this being a good movie.<br/><br/>How did it do? Well, I have to be honest and say that it's a heavily flawed film. Not all of the actors are well-suited for singing their lines - though oddly I didn't mind Russell Crowe all that much - the cinematography is way too in love with extreme closeups, the set pieces, while impressive, feel too cramped and the story jumps around, wanting to go over all the relevant plot details, but losing coherence in the process.<br/><br/>And despite all that, I was moved to tears by the end of the film. Naturally most of that is due to the strength of the original story, that of a criminal turned saint earning his redemption for his past crimes. But even a masterful story can mean nothing if it's told incorrectly. And that's not the case here. The extreme closeups can be distracting, as can be the singing, but the more the movie goes on, the more you find yourself being pulled in, feeling the emotions of the characters, the despair, the joy. It's a captivating experience, one the best I've seen in years. There were moments where I had to remind myself to breathe.<br/><br/>This movie is a rough jewel. It has raw talent to spare, but it loses some of it due to technical imperfections and poor choices. It is worth seeing, but at the same time you have to mourn what it could have been."
"jpkelem","9","0","0","30 December 2014"," Good, except...
","I would give it a 10/10 just because I'm such a die hard Les Mis fan, except a few things I can't stand about this version, and so I have to take off a point.<br/><br/>First, I can't put into words how incredibly annoyed I am at how the best people they've cast were ensembles. However, I do understand that in order to get people besides musical fans to see it, they needed big names as mains.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman...everyone's praising him and I don't see why. He's a great actor, but a singer? His vibrato is really annoying and his voice is quite nasally when singing the high notes, and honestly, they could've cast better. Also, Suddenly was a really unnecessary addition to the movie that I didn't understand. Why not remove that 60 seconds of irrelevant song and let Courfeyrac sing his bit in Red and Black, or let R have his incredibly meaningful solo in Drink With Me?<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway surprised me(in a good way), but she went from a healthy factory woman to a shriveled up prostitute in about thirty seconds. Since the movie version followed the book much better than the actual musical and there was the detail of camera, they should've made Anne look sickly from the beginning: because she's already quite sick and already dying by the time she's at the factory.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks(Eponine), George Blagden(Grantaire/R), Aaron Tviet(Enjolras), and Daniel Huttlestone(Gavroche) were the reasons I went to see this...I know, you non Mizzies are going, who? But they're probably the only ones who would be at all okay on a stage version(while addressing the leads, basically all the ensemble are Broadway/West End stars already--including the original Valjean and Eponine). I was so upset that George wasn't able to have his shining moment in Drink With Me: probably the most meaningful and emotional solo from the Les Amis/barricade boys. Sam was amazing, as always, but very very ""diluted"" probably because the female ""stars"" of the film are supposed to be Anne and Amanda, but Sam is better than both of them so they had to make her look worse...Aaron was great, but I feel like they turned down his vocals or something? He has a really powerful belt, sort of like Ramin Karimloo, but it just didn't seem as powerful as it usually is. Daniel was really good, I just sort of got confused when they completely changed his second solo in Look Down, although it makes sense why they changed it.<br/><br/>Since this followed the book so well, I really was disappointed that they didn't have Grantaire ask ""Do you permit it?"" as he and Enjolras died(and they didn't have Aaron/Enjolras ""press his hand with a smile""), and also I wish they'd added the bit where Eponine reveals that Gavroche is her brother--it seriously would've tacked on maybe, a minute of time? The real heartbreaking scene was when Javert put the pin on Gavroche and the background music was playing the line from Bring Him Home ""he's like the son I might have known if God had granted me a son.""<br/><br/>I know they had to promote Anne and Hugh...but honestly, the real stars of the cast were Sam, Dan, Aaron, Eddie, and George."

","Admittedly, while I enjoy some musicals, Les Mis was more operatic and lost me early. That being said, the cinematic story is rich, if not dark, and thankfully allowed some room for humor. The performances were a mixed bag, but I bought into the Hugh Jackman experience while I found Russell Crowe to be a but flat. Again, the story being completely told through non-song singing took too much energy to follow. If this were in French with sub-titles I could possible be raving about it. It is a Frenck story, no? I'll watch it again down the line, but no rush. I mentioned my disappointment to my on-line community and those who saw it live were shocked, but many who, like me, were DVD only viewers, the experience did not ""take me away"". This is a sad tale told through non-stop singing. If that sound good to you, then enjoy!"
"jake-lamotta-batman","7","0","0","16 August 2014"," Good film, one glaring problem.
","The film is a very well done piece, the music is truly top notch, however while listening, you will notice one glaring issue, Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is a pretty damn good actor, he can bring a sense of badass to just about any character from a Professor to Noah, however he can not sing worth a damn. When Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe sing talk to each other, it's like listening to a Broadway actor trying to teach a high school student how to do it. Russell Crowe gave a performance which was terrible, Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway deserve better as actors, especially Hugh Jackman who had to interact with Crowe the most. I am a huge fan of Russell Crowe as an actor, this movie was a bad choice on his part."
"mrrockey","7","0","0","30 May 2014"," Spectacular Performances Overcome Too Much Singing, Too Much Plot, and Some Flawed Technicals
","Am I the only guy who's willing to admit that I like musicals? Granted, I'm not a HUGE fan of musicals, but whenever I see a good one, I appreciate it. For me, a good musical shouldn't use a story as the backbone for the songs, but instead, use the songs to enhance the story it's telling. Sadly, a lot of musicals put too much emphasis on the musical aspect, but not enough on the actual story. Hairspray is a good example of this. It's a fun movie, but the story felt like a preachy anti-racism PSA and it tackled the subject a little too simplistically for my tastes. Does Les Miserables fare any better? Let's find out!<br/><br/>Les Miserables follows convict Jean Valjean in released on parole in 1815 France by prison guard Javert after serving a nineteen- year sentence for stealing a loaf of bread. Because of his status, he fails to find a job anywhere and is driven out of every town he visits. One night, he is offered food and shelter by a bishop only then, to find the authorities catching Valjean stealing his silver in the middle of the night. However, the bishop lies for him and spears him extra time in prison. Touched by his kindness, Valjean breaks parole and starts a new life under a new identity.<br/><br/>Les Miserables is a hard film to critique. It tries its best to stay faithful to the original Broadway musical while adjusting things here and there to make it more cinematic but for the most part, it stays incredibly accurate to the original play. Stage and film are two incredibly different mediums so if I criticize a certain aspect of the film, I'm almost ALWAYS criticizing the original play as well so it's kinda hard to criticize the filmmakers on this film. However, since this is an ADAPTATION, things SHOULD be changed so if there's an aspect in the film that doesn't work, I guess I'll criticize the filmmakers for it since it's THEIR job to change things up to make it work better as a film.<br/><br/>What works about Les Miserables, is the story of the journey and redemption of Jean Valjean. Hugh Jackman in this film, gives the performance of a lifetime in the role. His journey is incredibly moving as Jackman displays a strong variety of emotions here. From the despair of being an unemployed, homeless paroled convict, to the determination of wanting to turn his life around, to the care and affection he feels toward Cosette, to the guilt of being a wanted man who can't see Cosette getting married, it's all done with sincerity and believable emotion.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is mostly solid. The performance that's been getting the most fuss about, Anne Hathaway as Fantine, is excellent. She really sells the despair and sadness of a woman forced to pleasure men for a living and the makeup artists did an excellent job of making a woman as sexy as Anne Hathaway appear rusty and unappealing. Eddie Redmayne has the right dashing persona and looks as Maurius. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen offer some nice comic relief as the Thernardiers. And Amanda Seyfried is EFFECTIVE as Cosette, despite my disinterest in her character. The only real flaw in the cast, is Russell Crowe as Javert. While Crowe LOOKS the part, his singing is just incredibly bland throughout and he only seems to have one tone in his voice. But overall, a solid cast.<br/><br/>The sound mixing in the film is also very impressive. A lot of the songs have this big, powerful operatic sound to it and all the different actors'singing voices merge together flawlessly. I highly recommend getting this film on blu-ray if you own a blu-ray player.<br/><br/>However, with all that said and done, what DOESN'T work about this film, is the singing. It's not that the singing ITSELF was bad, it's just that there's too much of it. Nearly every single line of dialogue is sung, which works on stage, but on film, it comes off a little distracting and it makes the emotional moments lose a bit of impact because we've been sitting through singing the entire time so songs like I Dreamed a Dream or Javert's Suicide lose a bit of impact. If I had to rewrite the film, I would've kept the important, emotional ones such as Valjean's Soliloquy or Do You Hear the People Sing? but cut out ones like Fantine's Arrest or Suddenly.<br/><br/>Another problem is the amount of plot going on in this film. While Valjean's quest for redemption is a compelling one, he feels pushed to the side a bit in the second half with a bajillion characters coming in and coming out of the story. Some of the sub-plots were intriguing such as the revolution and Fantine's turn to prostitution but the love story between Marius and Cosette is really kinda shallow and cliché and uninteresting and it's made even worse with the unnecessary third wheel that is Eponine. I wished the film could've had more focus on Valjean and less on the supporting characters in the second act.<br/><br/>There's also some technical flaws with the film. The cinematography is just TERRIBLE in this film. There are FAR too many close-ups and uses of the fisheye lens and the use of shaky-cam is just inappropriate.<br/><br/>The production design also looks a little cheap and phony in places. A lot of times, I felt more like I was at a crappy soundstage than I was in 1800's France. There's also some lousy CGI crane shots on occasion that took out of the film.<br/><br/>But overall, Les Miserable's strong performances overcome those problems for me so I'll give it a 7/10."

It showed Gavroche, Fantine, and Eponine as well as some revolutionaries all in an endless barricade. Heaven is supposed to be a better place but instead everyone still looked gaunt and worn down. The movies highlights were A Heart Full of Love by Eponine, Marius, and Cosette, I Dreamed a Dream by Fantine, and the end song where Valjean dies. The song at the inn was truly hilarious with a few inappropriate scenes for younger viewers. The scene where the revolution actually takes place was quite sad. Some of my favorite characters died. As a previous review said, some of the songs sounded quite like the others and it was sort of confusing. A few of the characters' actions were not very believable and too good to be true. I do believe that some of the casting could have been better. Russell Crowe is not exactly the best singer. Anne Hathaway was great though. Again, I Dreamed a Dream was filled was so much emotion and told a story all on its own."

","First of all, I love Les Miserables. I've read the book, seen the film and the musical. So I've set high expectation on this musical-film version but also knew the film will present nothing new to me.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was a great cinematic experience. The story is touching and dramatic as always. The film stays quite faithful to the musical. However, I am not so happy with the casts. Hugh Jackman is okay for the role of Jean Valjean, though I still far prefer Colm Wilkinson and John Owen-Jones, the stage version's Jean Valjean. Anne Hathaway as Fantine has done a better job than I had expected, especially during her powerful solo 'I Dreamed a Dream'. Russell Crowe, however, is the worst cast! Javert is such an important role to the story, but he made it nothing. And his singing ability was too poor for a musical film. I really wondered how he got casted.<br/><br/>My favorite cast of this version turned out to be the little kid who played Gavroche. He is probably even the best Gavroche I've ever seen! The guys who played Enjolras and Grantaire also stole some of my attention, while Marius never.<br/><br/>There are some scenes I liked in particular (e.g. the barricades) and some I really disliked (e.g. the last scene of Javert), so I still have a bit of mixed feelings here. I think Tom Hooper has done a fairly good adaptation of Les Miz, anyway also not the best."

","""Les Miserables"" is fully narrated as a musical with almost all the dialogues sung and reminds of the 60s musicals like ""Oliver"" or ""My fair Lady."" From the maker of The Kings Speech, Les Miserables also charts a historical story set in the background of relationships, love, care, and humanity, which comes as a great feast for your eyes through superb cinematography and performances, with a small but a winning performance from Anne Hathaway as a prostitute, Hugh Jackman as a runaway parole, and Russel Crowe as a ruthless policeman. Set as a musical stage play, the film succeeds in its depiction of historical details and character development. However, the over doing of song sequences and over length of the movie certainly creates a distraction and takes away certain leverage from the film. But overall, the film is still impressive at instances and singing is also good. Anyway, I feel liking of this musical would be to the taste of the individual viewers.

","Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, and Anne Hathaway star in this musical update of the Victor Hugo classic novel, Les Miserables, about a poor man who stole a loaf of bread to feed him and his family, the repercussions of it, and how it hounds him for the rest of his life. I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one to have the following type of feelings about this film, as I discovered 300 posts that hated it. As a rule, I love musicals. But even from the opening scenes and lines, this didn't have the sincerity, heart or depth I had hoped. It gave no motivation for Hugh's character, Jean Valjean, or even any back story of how he got to be rowing in the opening scenes, except that he stole bread. How can anyone comprehend that, if they don't see it all in action? I do admit that Anne Hathaway was the best thing about it. She gave a great performance in a brief role. I have now seen three versions of this story: the 1930s version with Charles Laughton and Fredric March, the 1950s version with Michael Rennie, and this one. I liked even the Rennie version more than this one, as that was a very thoughtful and articulate film, but the best version of the three is the first. I'm sure there are foreign adaptations of Hugo's novel, but, if you want to see grand storytelling in epic style with more genuine feeling, then see the 1930s version. Sorry Anne, but this is a 2 and half hours waste of your time."

","Having seen this play twice, once on tour and once in London, I was hoping for a faithful reproduction of a great musical. From a visual and overall acting standpoint I think it did a good job. The singing on the other hand was absolutely dreadful. I get they were going for more intimacy vs what can be presented on stage, but at least a little bit of tone and melodic structure would have been nice. I think back to other musicals put in movies, even recent ones like Chicago or The Producers, and they all had pretty good singing. I also know Crowe, Hathaway and Jackman are all pretty good singers as well, with some actual Broadway experience so I can only assume it is the director that pushed for this. It's almost as if they were ashamed of presenting what is the most memorable part of this musical, THE SCORE!"

I thought it was awesome how Anne Hathaway did not use a wig when they cut her hair, but instead used her own hair, it was a very charitable thing to do, while it also made the scene seem more genuine. This movie was cast perfectly in all roles except Jean Valjean and Javier.

","I didn't know anything about this story before watching the movie. I thought it was good. All of the songs weren't great, but they were good and told the story. Everyone sings in this, there is very little talking, all the story is told in song. The only negative thing I could say is the story is so depressing. People do not get happy endings in this movie.<br/><br/>I thought Russell Crowe was excellent and probably didn't win awards since he has won them in previous films. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter had the best roles. They were the comedic relief and very funny. They just had great characters. And I didn't think Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar. She was OK, but only in a very small role as her character was only in the very beginning. I just didn't think the role was strong enough to win awards.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like musicals, it's a must see. If you want a decent story, then this is a good choice too."

"gregorybnyc","5","0","0","3 September 2013"," Not a Bad Movie if You Can Take Some Truly Mediocre Singing
","I finally screwed up my courage and sat through this on Sunday. I thought the director did a very good job of pacing this dark and gloomy tale. But only Anne Hathaway could truly sing it, and her acting was touching and believable. She deserved her Academy Award. The rest of the cast was pretty miserable, vocally. I suppose Hugh Jackman has yelled himself out of a once truly nice Broadway lyric baritone. ""Bring him home,"" was full or rocky moments, vocally, and he resorted to yelling without a floating lyric line, necessary for this difficult-to-sing role. Besides, asForbidden Broadway waggishly lampooned the song, ""it's too high,"" for his lower-centered voice. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe was a dour Jauvert and his singing was unpleasantly one-dimensional. Samantha Barks' Eponine was sincere, but the singing was uneven. Amanda Seyfried's Cosette twittered in a high, squeaky, unsupported soprano that was unpleasant to listen to. Eddie Redmayne as Marius, sang well enough, but lacked charisma in close-ups. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen mostly spoke their song lyrics, and ""Master of the House"" passed by without any impact at all. <br/><br/>Whoever was responsible for the musical side of things on this picture, was undone by camera-ready stars with inadequate voices. This is a sung-through musical, with dialog that requires expressive singing, near operatic singing. Only Marius's doomed revolutionaries had the necessary vocal thrust for their parts. <br/><br/>The reason the movie musical is an endangered species--oh hell, the genre is as dead as a western--is that movie studios put musical matters in the hands of people who don't trust the music to make its affect. The composers of LES MISERABLES intended for this score to be sung by professional singing actors. They had enough star power with Jackman and Hathaway. It didn't need mediocre singing to undermine one's enjoyment."

","The songs are brilliant, as they've always been. Though this time they are set in splendid sets. I loved the concept of live singing for a movie; they came out pretty well, and had a strong effect. The main disadvantage is that the songs are set in a dull atmosphere, and sometimes seem a bit too gloomy (for two and a half hours). And while adapting from stage to movie musical, the screenplay could have been developed a bit more; the audiences are not allowed to invest themselves in the characters. The movie sure has its rare but heartwarming moments; the last scene echoes with a melancholic ray of hope.<br/><br/>Acting is top notch, especially Hugh Jackman's lead. Anne's small but brilliantly acted role is far from forgettable. <br/><br/>With such a talented cast and an innovative Director, the movie is not what it could have been."
"euan-scott","6","0","0","7 August 2013"," Excellent performances let down by unfortunate direction.
","I'll start by saying that if you don't care about cinematography, or are willing to overlook it, or are a fan of Les Miserables then you should see this film. The performances were all impeccable, with Anne Hathaway standing out. It says a lot for her ability as an actor and performer when she stands out from the cast of this film. As for the costumes, set design and lighting, they were all in keeping with the theme of the script, and couldn't have been significantly improved on in any way.<br/><br/>However, there is one problem stopping me from gushing all over this film: Tom Hooper's direction. He seems to have this style of extreme close-up combined with a wide-angle lens (we saw this in The King's Speech), and unfortunately it hinders this film more than it helps it.<br/><br/>Whilst the surreal effect this creates might add something to say, Master Of The House, I don't know why I need to be looking up Valjean's nose every 5 minutes. It's just distracting.<br/><br/>The close-up allows a sense of great emotional connection and empathy with the actor, and nowhere is this more obvious than I Dreamed A Dream. This is how to use a close-up. Anne Hathaway's performance, subdued, mimics her surroundings perfectly, resulting in an Oscar-winning performance that almost had me in tears. But that's only about half an hour into the film, so we then have to sit through another hour and a half of attempts at closeness and intimacy, seriously overusing the close-up, that results in claustrophobic camera-work; all trying to recreate that magic of that scene, when they just needed to step back and let the actors breathe rather than hammering us with the close-up.<br/><br/>The choice to use live recordings of the singing results in the editors using the best takes, meaning we have one moment where Hugh Jackman walks into the camera, about 50 where the main point of focus ends up off-screen, and as for the editing of Javert's suicide: I burst out laughing. It was laughable, and completely ruined the tone of the scene, doing Russell Crowe a disservice.<br/><br/>In conclusion: if you're willing to overlook the interesting shot-choices and shaky Handy-cam then you'll probably enjoy this film. I'm not a fan of musicals, and I did. However, the dodgy camera-work takes what could have been the best film of the year, and turns it into a merely good film."
"OttoVonB","6","0","0","31 July 2013"," Concerning Musicals...
","In this adaptation of Victor Hugo's monumental Les Miserables, released convict Jean Valjean (Jackman) travels France with a marked pass, condemning him to a life on the fringes of society, until one good soul gives him the means to start his life over - and help others. He soon encounters various poor souls: heartbroken mother Fantine (Hathaway), orphaned Cosette (Allen, then Seyfried), and malicious Tenardiers (Cohen and Carter). All the while the ghost of his past haunts him down in the form of Inspector Javert (Crowe).<br/><br/>Many other media have tried to do Hugo's epic justice, and it is somehow inevitable that all will fall short in at least some way. This film is a direct film translation of the Broadway musical, so it is hard to comment on adaptation decisions without having seen said musical, which I never have. I came to this almost completely fresh, curious to see how the musical chose to condense Hugo's original, and above-all curious to see how Tom Hooper had applied his ""revolutionary"" live-singing technique. <br/><br/>You see, dear reader, I also came to this as not the greatest fan of the musical genre. In fact, I always find musical interludes in films awkward and a bit random, and though I can often appreciate the songs and how they are used on their own merit, the combination with a normal film always jars for me, with the exception of Dancer in The Dark, where the music is essential to the plot. Les Miserables is very different in that respect because almost every single line is sung, quite like opera. And opera's a different kettle of fish altogether, am extreme choice. Points for that, even if it doesn't make the long running time feel any shorter at all.<br/><br/>Hooper courageously backed himself into a corner with this one: unable to go for the stage short-hand of favoring voice over acting abilities, he has to balance both, as emotions in cinema primarily work through close-ups. Kudos then for the parts of the casting that actually work. Jackman, always a dependable and sympathetic one to shoulder a film on, gives a good fight, as do many of the other secondary performers. And the film justifies its entire existence and method in Fantine's ""I dreamed a dream"", sung in an extended close-up by a sublime Anne Hathaway.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the seams aren't always as expertly sown. Russell Crowe proves the weak link - as extensively discussed on this film's message boards - his voice unable to match his acting chops. It's never as painful as listening the Gerard Butler in Joel Schumacher's dreadful Phantom of the Opera, but it gets close. Also, the film is at its weakest when it strays from the I Dream A Dream format and goes for big wide shots, craning cameras etc, that aim to give the world scale but make it feel stagey instead, an odd contradiction with Hooper's stated intent. <br/><br/>In the end, the film is a fascinating experiment. Tom Hooper continues what he began with The King's Speech: wide angle, hand-held close-ups and intimate rapport between the actor and the camera. It's in all those conflicted moments when he remembers that he's making a big Hollywood musical that the temptation to embrace the genre's cliché's undoes the film.<br/><br/>Worth seeing at least once."

","The 1980 musical once again comes to the screen in ""Les Miserables"", featuring an all-star cast and from the director of ""The King's Speech."" 16 years after the French Revolution, Jean Valjean (played by Hugh Jackman) is released on parole after nearly two decades of slavery by Inspector Javert (played by Russell Crowe). He is offered shelter by the Bishop of Digne, but steals his silver during the evening. After being caught by authorities, though, the Bishop deceptively informs them that the silver was given as a gift, and secures Valjean's release. Touched by the Bishop's grace, Valjean makes an incredible redemption, promising to start a new and better life.<br/><br/>Eight years later, Valjean becomes a factory owner, but is still living in fear of Javert. One of his workers, Fantine (astonishingly played by Anne Hathaway), is discovered to have given birth to a child out of wedlock, and is sending money to her illegitimate daughter, Cosette. When she is dismissed by the foreman, she is left with no other choice but to become a prostitute.<br/><br/>Hathaway then gives us the performance of her career as she sings ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in one long close-up that blew everyone away at her audition alone; a heart-wrenching and mesmerizing single act that must be seen to be believed. Goodness knows she deserved the Oscar for this one.<br/><br/>What's more impressive is that despite her character's significance, she's not in the film for very long. Javert, now a police inspector, arrests Fantine, but Valjean intervenes and takes her to the hospital. As she dies, Valjean promises to be a father to Cosette. He then flees with her from Javert.<br/><br/>The only characters I didn't care for were the couple whom Cosette lives with before going to be with Valjean (played by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). I guess they're supposed to be comic relief, but I just didn't find it all humorous how the man continually mistakes Cosette's name. Otherwise, the first act of this film is compelling and had me allured by the story.<br/><br/>The second act, however was disengaging. It takes place nine years later when Cosette is a young woman (now played by Amanda Seyfried) and has found a love interest. The characters are less developed and the plot suddenly shifts into a war story when the Parisians revolt. Frankly, I began to lose interest.<br/><br/>The film makes a comeback, however, in the wonderfully executed third act. For those who haven't seen the movie, I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say, one part made me think of Judas.<br/><br/>95% of the dialogue in the film is sung. You'd think that would mean very talented musical actors are necessary. It does not. Russell Crowe wasn't very good, and Hugh Jackman sounded a bit raspy, but somehow, it didn't seem to matter. (Anne Hathaway was excellent, though) This was a tough movie to rate, but I finally awarded it a strong 7/10. It was worth the watch."

","Les Misérables. Such an incredible story overall. The book is long and complex and all of that but this certain adaptation was just okay. The main reason being that I don't think that this ensemble cast could tell the story the way they did without singing. The Musical aspect made the film. Without the singing i think the film would be horrid. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway were phenomenal as well as the young girl Amanda Seyfried, boy can she sing. Also I didn't like the young man they chose for Marius, Eddie Redmayne, could have easily found a better choice. Although lots of the movie was hard to focus on, such as the Directing. I don't know Tom Hooper very well but i do respect him for this movie and The King's Speech. I did especially love the cinematography, it fit perfectly with the story. When i read the story this year in school i was able to subtly imagine the words in my head. I feel as though this movie is how most if not everyone sees the words when read. The adapted screenplay seemed easy to adapt into a film, since it was a play even before the film. And though I have read the book, this ending still nearly made me cry. Of course they took some parts out of the book but the minimal amount of. It was a good okay film but i expected more. I understand that it is a sad story of sorrow and new love. But in the end i feel like the main grasped conflict was sadness. I would've loved to see more internal conflict shown through production and acting. I consider this movie at par."

Hugh Jackman was truly devoted to his performance, it was his moment to shine, and he sparkled. Anne Hathaway was brilliant. As a foreigner to music, Russel Crowe exceeded far beyond our expectations of what he might perform, he was very organic with his voice. Eddie Redmayne was breathtaking! His ""Empty Chairs At Empty Tables"" was a masterpiece. Samantha Barks was an excellent Eponine. My only downfall was Amanda Seyfried, she did a good job but didn't rose to the perfection that everyone else were at. The other cast were as amazing as well, Gavoroche, Enjolras .. <br/><br/>The Costumes, the set, the sound editing and mixing, it was all perfectly executed. And of course the brilliant Tom Hooper did what he always does, making a glamorous masterpiece. <br/><br/>I'm astonished that it didn't reach top #250 yet, it deserves a spot.

","I wasn't sure what I was going to make of ""Les Misérables"". I'm a casual fan of the original stage musical, having starred in a youth amateur dramatic version as a teenager, but I was intrigued to see how it may play as an actual film considering its stagy, somewhat conceptual nature. As it turned out, I really enjoyed it. It does seem to run on a bit too long, but I think that is the case with such an epic story following several characters over several decades. Interestingly, the film adds in a lot of plot points and details from Hugo's novel originally trimmed from the stage musical.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure how the live singing aspect would work (especially since some of the soundtrack recordings sounded a bit muffled), but I do think it worked really, really well, and gave an authenticity to the production. The performances were generally all very good, in particular Anne Hathaway as Fantine and Russel Crowe as Javert. The ""I Dreamed a Dream"" number brought me to tears, as did the reprise of ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" at the end of the film. I can easily recommend this film to anybody who is interested in musicals or historic cinema in general."

","Tom Hooper knew what he was doing when he put forth the thought of making the actors sing live in Les Miserables, but it needed to be in a more steadier hand. The pros was that he hired experienced actors that have sung in musicals. The cons however was hiring an actor like Russel Crowe. Hugh Jackman does his best, he really does he deserved his Oscar nomination, you can tell that this man has done this before. Same with Anne Hathaway, even though it seems that she has less screen time than Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Russel Crowe is the black sheep of the film- it was like he punched himself in the stomach really, really hard before each scene. He cannot stop singing in the upper register and it is very distracting. I am not a very big fan of his acting all together, it seemed that his character had no development whatsoever and that he struggled to illustrate any of his complexities. Everyone else did OK. There was nothing that really stood out. About 80% of all the shots were up close at the actor's faces, which was extremely distracting. In the end, the one element that saves the film is the music. One of the only ways I can recommend this film is the phenomenal music, which is what got me through this film, which is what will get you through this film. There is really nothing else I can say but, you will appreciate it afterward. No, not to like the film but to appreciate it."

So let's look at this as a plain movie: As a movie its excellent. Great scenery, dresses, environment. Excellent acting and dramatization.<br/><br/>Here is the catch. It's not a plain simple drama movie. It's a musical! As a musical I saidhmm in this case: ""Huston we have a problem"". Sounds of Music /My Fair Lady and many more were musicals and movies as well. They were perfect in both versions. One expects the performers to be able to provide an acceptable level of musical performance. As good as Hugh Jackman is as an actor he is not close to be a valued singer or vocal performer that can encapsulate the epic role of Jean Valjean .As an actor yes-he can.as a singer –vocal performer he would be less than 4/10 on the Arik scale. (Where Alfie Boe and Colm Wilkinson represent the 10/10. There are excellent actors that are also great vocal performers. Eddie Redmayne deserves to be nominated as one of them, so do Amanda Seyfried, Aaron Tveit , Samantha Barks . I am struggling with my opinion about Anne Hathaway's vocal capabilities..6-7/10 on the Arik scale. All in all: I saw the movie twice.

","I'm not a fan of movie musicals, yet I had high hopes for this film based on its critical accolades.<br/><br/>A few things irked me, some moved me, and some just seemed odd.<br/><br/>First, the good stuff: Hugh Jackman is amazing. I loved the nuanced changes in his singing to match changes in his character. Anne Hathaway was a revelation -- too bad (as others have noted) she barely has any screen time -- especially when her character's plight is so well-covered in the novel. The ""live"" singing allowed for the actors to really ""act""and the emotion in their voices made for a more moving viewing experience.<br/><br/>However, the film seems very confused about what it is striving to be. Yes, it has credible moments of realism, but these are completely undermined by every scene involving Baron-Cohen and Bonham-Carter. Comic relief in Les Mis? Really? And their costumes? Moulin Rouge meets Les Mis -- very schizoid.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried is grating with a voice which, while even in tone and pitch (I suppose) is always the same and her performance seems to rely overly on her (to my mind) bizarre appearance: eyes virtually on the side of her head and lips that seem to have no muscle control. (Apologies to her fans, but I think she's tremendously overrated).<br/><br/>Don't get me started on Russell Crowe (whom I actually and usually admire).<br/><br/>Uneven pacing, weird directorial decisions (the Thénardiers), and such drastic alternations between stark realism and black comedy left me... underwhelmed."

","Les Miserables was a remarkable literary work and was brought to life as a powerful drama during the 30's or 40's. I am not sure who or why it was turned into a stage show. Don't get me wrong some of the musical pieces in this film were mesmerizing, Anne Hathaway's raw emotion in I dreamed a dream, the stirring chorus of Can you hear the people sing and Hugh Jackman's powerful, Bring him home. But the movie needed a script, the songs should have been support. Maybe the makers of the film needed to focus less on the stage show and found a balance between it and the original drama. If this had been achieved Les Miserables would have been remarkable. Sorry I have to add Russell Crowe should never sing again, he is terrible!"

","""Les Misérables"" isn't for everyone, but fans of the stage version will not be disappointed. While successfully ""opening up"" the musical far beyond the limitations of a theater-bound production, Tom Hooper retains its heart and soul. In many ways, the movie is more opera than musical. There's very little dancing and even less spoken dialogue. Visually, ""Les Misérables"" is a splendid spectacle, with set and costume design that is second to none. Hooper does an excellent job recreating 19th century France, and it's in this area that the motion picture separates itself from the live version. What it lacks in the intimacy of singers performing directly to an audience, it gains in cinematic achievement. <br/><br/>That being said--to the causal movie viewer unfamiliar with Victor Hugo's novel; a timeless testament to the survival of the human spirit--it is a tedious, bloated, and exhausting 238 minutes you'll never get back."

","As a huge fan of musical movies, I had been waiting for thiz. It's one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Soon after I walked out of the theater, I realized that thiz movie was very peculiar. Let me put it thiz way, as the musical, I can confidently say that the music is not at its best. If you listen to the song without seeing the movie, it will feel like half-baked. But if you see it as a movie experience as a whole, when you can see the Actors are singing with their expression and emotion, at that time, then you can feel that thiz is a very strong and breathtaking musical movie. In short, it fell hard as a musical but heartfelt as a movie. Tom Hooper is a film Director who is always able to capture his characters with totality without missing a single thing through his unique cinematography, as shown in ""The Damned United"" (2009) and ""The King's Speech"" (2010). In thiz famous classic tale, there are so many interesting characters to be explored. There is Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) an ex-convict who struggles to redeem his sin, Javert (Russel Crowe) who is a ruthless police inspector, Fantine (Anne Hathaway) a single mother who turned into streetwalker, Thénardier and his wife (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) who are sophisticated gang of thieves, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) who is beautiful daughter of Fantine, Marius (Eddie Redmayne) who is a courageous revolutionary partisan, Éponine (Samantha Barks) who is spoiled daughter of Thénardier and everybody's favorite the brave little boy Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone). I notice what Tom Hooper has done as the Director in order to build a strong impression for each of his characters. He simply gives everyone at least one chance to deepen their characters by singing in a special close-up segment. Each character, major role or small role, has thiz particular segment. And guess who is taking thiz opportunity well? It's Anne Hathaway who makes a convincing heartrending performance by giving up her pretty long hair and successfully bringing out all the emotions. The other Actor who surprises me is Hugh Jackman. Jackman also takes his role very seriously and it definitely pays off. His character as Jean Valjean has many up and down situations but he has no trouble at all playing it. And for the refreshing part (since the movie is extremely melancholy from the very beginning), the comical couple Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as Monsieur and Madame Thénardier have succeeded to cheer up the atmosphere by delivering some fresh humor. The first half of the movie is about suffering and the second half is more about love. Whatever it is, we are finally coming to the conclusion that suffering and love are the things that keep human learning. Anyway, I love the spirit! It's all about the spirit of a minority, the spirit of change and the resistance against absolute monarchy and oppression. In the end, I have to admit that thiz movie is not for everyone, particularly if you are not a fan of musicals. Nevertheless, thiz movie still conclude with a very good ending indeed. There is a gratifying feeling after watching the ending. In fact, if you are in the right mood, you might end up with a happy tear.

","Les Mis is a reminder of how well musicals work on screen. Screening a musical allows every actions and expression to be slowed down, exaggerated and repeated. Les Mis takes fully advantage of this in squeezing that extra tear out.<br/><br/>And the tears do flow. Death features early, cutting Anne Hathaway's surprisingly moving performance short. There are some laughs too, albeit tiny ones, thanks to the unlikely comic duo Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Meanwhile, the main story between Hugh Jackman's Valjean and Russel Crowe's Javert comes through nicely, a story of revenge left unfulfilled and duty left uncertain, demonstrating emotion and intent that does not rely entirely on the music to convey.<br/><br/>The most convincing musical performances of course come from the women of the cast, simply because the more impressive and better known songs are written for them. The camera holds on to the intensity of Samantha Barks' 'On My Own', taking an unremitting view of her from above as she rises to a crescendo, as if we the audience are seated in the Royal Circle at the Queen's Theatre.<br/><br/>I haven't yet made it to see Les Mis in the theatre, but I could certainly see that this is where the film had come from, which would actually be my one main criticism of the film. There were a few great Parisian and Alpine views, but why not show us more of this when you can? Similarly, by restricting our view of the story's main action to this one barricade with the actors assembling furniture like props on stage, the film gives the impression that the entire June Rebellion consisted of about twelve men and a little cockney lad.<br/><br/>Perhaps in an effort to stay close to musical theatre, by asking the actors to sing 'live' for instance, Tom Hooper occasionally forgot that he was making a film."

","Despite stellar cast I was not impressed. It will be quite difficult to surpass the performances seen and heard in ""Les Misérables in Concert: The 25th Anniversary"". I was disappointed by the performances only a little. Nonetheless the story was richer and much more seamless so I have finally understood the story to perfection. Huge praise goes to Samantha Barks; gorgeous and incredibly talented with a voice and looks of an angel. I expected the Thenadier character to be more shining compared to other Sacha Cohen Baron's characters. Many musicals encompass a range of emotions, but none run the whole gamut with quite the same power as Les Miserables"

","Given that I have never seen any former Les Miserables productions, I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Hooper's version of Les Miserables. However, there were two aspects of the movie that I found annoying compared to other musicals that have been converted into movies. Usually, I find that the songs are the highlight of the movie like those in Phantom of the Opera, but when watching Les Mis, I found myself looking forward to lines that were spoken instead of sung. I understand that this is a musical, but the songs would have been more appreciated if every line were not sung. Secondly, every singing performance was filmed in a similar fashion that ended with a close up of the singer's face on the right hand side of the screen. Despite the superfluous singing, I thought the casting, scene design, and costumes were extremely well done. Jackman and Hathaway's performances were incredibly strong and should put them into serious contention for Oscars."

","My favourite musical stage show of all time, with a track record of four West End (London)visits + the O2 25th Anniversary special in 2011. In many respects the film enhances the story and includes elements from the book that complete the tale. The battle scenes are particularly well done in a way that no stage production could ever match.The only let down in my view was the weakness of the two lead actors voices - Colm Wilkinson's cameo was a clear illustration of of what some fine singers have brought to the stage role. Alfie Boe was a fine 'O2' Valjean, but is presumably not box office in the USA. From the first reviews I expected Les Mis to become my No1. of all time, but sadly it just missed out.My other disappointment was the abrupt and obvious editing watching the film in Dubai."

A grandiose visual spectacle featuring some wonderful songs, strong performances--especially Jackman and Hathaway--and a vivid sense of time and place, though some of the emotional impact is muted by the film's long running time.

This rushed performance skims through the complexities and beauties of Les Miserables, seemingly to arrive at a ""showstopping"" number. With shallow depth-of-field throughout, the obvious focal point is the star cast, abandoning the setting which and the characters who make up Les Miserables. I would have much preferred a part one and two take at this story, covering the depth of the narrative.

","An accurate way to describe Les Misérables would ironically be to compare it to a music album. There are songs that you play over and over, and then there are songs that when you hear it, you hand reaches towards the skip button. There are many scenes that hit home; however, at the same time there were several parts that were superfluous. Les Misérables was a film that showed little restraint, stuffing its lengthy running time with heaping measurements of grandeur. This worked for, and against it.<br/><br/>It seems pointless to mention the soundtrack, but nevertheless, it was magnificent as expected. It's a musical. Duh. Most of the singers carried their weight. Anne Hathaway was flawless in both acting and singing, and Eddie Redmayne, Amanda Seyfried, and Hugh Jackman held their own. Russel Crowe however, was the weak link. Though his acting was exceptional as usual, his vocals were mostly underwhelming. The set-pieces were breathtaking and effective, fitting the fantastical and slightly dilapidated nature of stage sets, yet grounded in the reality of film.<br/><br/>The story itself was magnificent, with a strong thesis and an armada of interesting, well developed, and colorful characters. Many of the scenes held endless meaning and relevance to life, resulting from the moving character conflicts of redemption, forgiveness, sacrifice, and working towards the future. The ideas contained in this story were so near to greatness; however, an unforeseen and unavoidable enemy stopped them short. Les Misérables was a musical. Too much time was wasted on singing and pomp, eventually burying the ideas of the film. There are several instances in which an entire three to four minute song will be devoted to ""We are dishonest innkeepers."" something that could've been shown in a mere three to four seconds. To compensate, Les Misérables was rushed from set-piece to set-piece in order to incorporate all the songs. There was no time for patience or subtlety because so much time was wasted on trivial information. <br/><br/>In film I have always emphasized the importance of patience and subtlety. Though Les Misérables was a grand affair worthy of the hall of fame of musicals, its grandness was so constant that the contrasts between the scenes became deluded. I was surprised by how little I was crying, as I normally do under such moving circumstances. But because no time was allotted for pondering or rising action, everything was just one big climax. It was like a parent spinning their child around playfully, but never embracing them. That kid is going to get dizzy. Grandeur most be used sparingly so that when it comes, it's actually something special.<br/><br/>Les Misérables was so was close to being great, but ultimately the choice to produce the musical adaptation of the book rather than the book itself eventually led to its demise. If it was a film, there could have been more focus in the plot leading to an increased clarity of the ideas. The musical aspect of the production only wasted time on the art of music, distracting from the art of film. It depolarized the atmosphere, dampening the power of many of the moments in the film. Les Misérables is an excellent musical, but it made too many sacrifices to reach that end, ultimately hurting the film."
"matz1036","7","0","0","28 December 2012"," Really Good, but just shy of greatness
","Let's start off by saying that I am a little bit of a Les Mis purist. I fell in love with the stage show overnight and was involved with a community theater production this year. Therefore I am VERY familiar with the exact order that songs are sung. So early on I was a bit confused when they changed a few lyrics, added a few scenes, changed the order of songs, and omitted one song almost entirely. These changes are forgivable and understandable considering this is a movie and not the actual stage show, but for those of you out there that expect it to be a direct adaptation, be ready for a few curve balls. There are a few things that they add to the movie that come from the book that they usually omit in the stage show, so that was a nice addition for people who like the book as well.<br/><br/>When it comes to actor performances, I will start off by saying that all the hype spoken about Anne Hathaway's performance is spot on. She is truly the best part of the movie, hands down! Hugh Jackman is also pretty good, though he doesn't ever sing falsetto, which takes away some of the beauty of the moment in one of his songs. Samantha Barks is really good as Eponine, though she was slightly better suited for the role in the 25th Anniversary concert version.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, while a surprisingly decent singer, just doesn't fit as Javert. He lacks a lot of the depth and emotion that I have seen in other Javerts and his singing is too ""clean"". He is ultimately better than I expected, but still sticks out as a weak link in this movie. I'm curious if Paul Bettany could have done better. Also, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thernardiers are also ""not quite right"". They are not as comical and over the top as they needed to be. Then again, maybe that's the purist in me speaking.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a really good adaptation of the stage show. They add a few good things, place Fantine's signature song in a more logical place, and convey a lot more subtleties and raw emotion that the stage show can not convey. However, it's not a ""perfect"" adaptation.<br/><br/>I suspect someone who hasn't seen the stage show would like it a bit more than myself."

","For those of us who can't attend plays on Broadway or in London, a well-crafted film like ""Les Miserables"" is a boon for our cultural sensibility. I appreciated its adherence, as much as possible, to a live theatrical presentation with the bonus of a variety of scenic locales not possible on a stage. I liked the interjection of spoken words either prior to or during songs. That choice provided contrast and pacing at appropriate moments. It's wonderful to know that our favorite top actors have such range in their ability and got the chance to show it. Kudos to the casting directors, cinematography crew and costume designers."
"jsaus63304","9","0","0","26 December 2012"," I really enjoyed it but the stage version is better.
","As a fan of the musical, I have been waiting anxiously for the movie to come out. I was expecting less of the movie after, for example, the film version of ""Phantom of the Opera"". While this version did follow the play pretty well, it did sacrifice for a production over a musical. All in all, the vocals were very good, at least once you got past Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Sacha Baron-Cohen. In fact, after I got home, I dug out my 10th Anniversary DVD with the dream cast to drown out the memories of a couple of the vocals. Hugh Jackman did not do terribly, but his voice was a little worberly and he just could not do justice to ""Bring him home"". Russell Crowe just did not have a powerful enough voice for the part, especially in a song like ""Stars"". He just was not anything like Phillip Quast in the vocal department. Although the Sacha Baron-Cohen portrayal of the innkeeper was entertaining, it just did not hold up to the stage version. Ann Hathaway gave a very emotional performance even to the point that she took a very emotional song (I Dreamed a Dream) maybe a little too far. The lead women definitely outperformed the men in the vocal department.<br/><br/>I thing the movie would have been better if the lead characters had been played by people who had actually starred in the rolls on stage. Of course, we need name recognition to draw people to the box office and the acting was quite good. The, shall we say, lesser rolls were obviously played by people who had a stage background and it showed. It would be impossible to find fault with Samantha Barks as Eponine but then she played the part on Broadway.<br/><br/>With my few criticisms aside, the movie version was quite good and well worth seeing. For the reviews that complained about the singing of every line, hey it's a musical and that is the way the stage version is done. Do not try to compare it to any of the other movies based on the book. It is worth noting that the theater was the most quiet I have every heard during a movie except for the sobbing you occasionally heard. Yes, bring a tissue with you. And, do not come expecting to see the feel good movie of the year.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the ""grand finale"" ending with the barricade that looked quite like the stage version. Although I missed it in the earlier scene, I noticed in the finale that the original Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson, played the Bishop. All in all, a very good movie that I intend to add to my DVD collection when it comes out."

He's still with Sam, who made the pants too long and the suits of cellophane invisible to the brainwashed eye. I just sat through this bad joke and boy, is that a new way to grow old. How do I loathe it? Let me count the ways. Where to start, aye, there's the rub. Take the plot - please. See if I've got this right; it begins with a lot of dead-beats pulling a boat on dry land. Why? Where to? Your guess is as good as mine. Russell Crowe is watching and because I know him and have read some PR I know he plays Javert. I'm looking for Hugh Jackman, who I know from the same PR plays Jean VAljean. I don't really know Jackman but I do know he plays lead roles in lots of musicals so I'm looking for a good-looking young guy. Javert singles out one of the dead-beats, guy about sixty and from the way he speaks I realize that THIS is Jackman. Javert gives him the 'you can run but you can't hide spiel and Jackman walks away. Next thing he's wolfing down food in a church. Minutes later he's stealing silver from the same church. The Feds catch him, bring him back and the priest,bishop, whoever says to Valjean, you left the best stuff behind and lays some more silver on him, as you do. Next thing Valjean is the maire and Javert is telling him that he, Javert, is a waste of space, Valjean disagrees. Then we see Ann Hathaway making a tough dollar. For no apparent reason Valjean tells her he'll raise her daughter Cosette, so she can die happy. Then there's what passes for a comic interlude with Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter hamming it up and, in passing, selling Cosette to Valjean. Then the 'people' are revolting. Cosette is grown and catches the eye of one of the revolutionaries. Javert is back. Lots of shout, lots of gunfire, lots of blood. Gimme a break here. After four hours I was losing the will to live. Okay, how about realism? To have one woman burst into song on her deathbed is ludicrous; to have TWO women do so is manipulation and when, for an encore, you have the leading man burst into song on HIS deathbed you got trouble, my friends, right there in Writer City. Now for the so-called music. About the fifth hour I actually detected two words that came within a mile of actually RHYMING, when Samantha Barks (great name, sounds like what the whole CAST was doing from beginning to end) sings about love and (almost) rhymes 'my life CHANGES' with 'world full of STRANGERS', close, but don't give up your day job, Monsieur Kretzmer - and rest easy Cole Porter, Larry Hart, Johnny Mercer, Yip Harburg, Frank Loesser etc, you got nothing to worry about here. To be fair to Kretzmer he was anglicizing French lyrics and fitting them to music already in place. He was probably glad of the gig in 1985 and did it for scale. Having said that most of this stuff is just banal conversation set to music and rising to a crescendo every eighth or ninth word. They were probably trying for 'stirring'. It's as if MacDonalds commissioned Elton John to hang around one of their outlets eavesdropping on the punters and then set their conversation to non-melodic music so the effect is something like this: 'I'll take a Big Mac and F-R-I-E-S', 'You want KETCHUP WITH THAT?' 'Gimme a WHOP- per and HOLD the M-A-Y-O'.<br/><br/>Apart from that this was a great movie and should clean up at the brain- dead Oscars."

","I never have understood why Hollywood insists on casting movie stars in musical roles even when it's obvious they don't suit the part. And I've never understood why a director will take a blockbuster stage hit and decide it's a perfect opportunity to insist on new ways of filming a show designed for the stage originally. Les Miserables is yet another example of this though.<br/><br/>I'm late to this because I refused to pay to see this film in the theater after hearing how poorly the elements in the previews were sung. I recorded it the other night when it was on TV though, with hopes that I'd been misled. When I watched it, I did not even recognize the music I love. The techniques of recording all music live sung did not serve the music well - even more so because none - and I do mean NONE - of the cast were up to singing their roles. Some did better than others, but none were good. The lousy acoustics of real life were not an assist for anyone. (The sung-thru nature doesn't bother me in the slightest when it's well done. I happen to be an opera fan too.)<br/><br/>The decision to make everything as dirty and gritty as possible also was not good. Ye, it may have been more realistic for early 19th century Pairs, but it stole a lot of the story line by just being depressing. Seriously, musical theater is never created to give people nothing but a sense of dirty,gritty reality. Some are more grim than others, but none are created to be as depressing as this movie began.<br/><br/>As it happens, I just couldn't stand to watch all of the movie. I gave up completely when even Enjolras, Marius and the other young men were unable to sing their parts as they needed to be done. Some were not even singing in the original registers and these were not major roles!<br/><br/>I'm bothering to write this review at this late date in case anyone comes along wondering why anyone likes this show and happens to read this. Look on Youtube for the 10th Anniversary Concert version of Les Mis with the Dream Cast. It has most of the original music and is what cased m to fall in love with this work. And despite being in a concert format, the actor-singers manage to embody their roles more fully than anyone in the movie seemed to be doing. It probably doesn't hurt that they knew the roles inside out from performing them life hundreds of times. It's a damn shame no one thought to cast people who had done wondrous jobs in their role on stage to reprise that role for the film."

","Like some of the other posters, I cannot believe some of the good reviews this film has gotten. Based on the classic novel by Victor Hugo, the entire story is told with music - and spectacularly boring music it is, at that. Any high school kid (with or without a music background) could come up with stuff like this. Anne Hathaway sings well, Russell Crowe (famously) does not. He has the range of a bull moose snorting angrily through a foghorn. Most of the cast try really hard with this material, but major plot points are obscured (or ignored) by poor writing. It is never a good idea to render an entire story, with all its dialog, in music. If you don't want every detail shouted at you in feverish pitch, avoid this thing like the plague. I kept waiting for this to get better - and it never, ever did. The production values are OK, but the whole thing seems endlessly long, and by the end, I was just waiting for the whole mess to be over! Don't waste your time - see the wonderful 1930s version (no music there, thank God) with Fredric March and Charles Laughton (as the evil inspector). A true classic, that was."

","I don't CARE which ""represents the book"" better; what matters is the movies! I have't read the book, and I'm not about to start. But as far as STORY goes, Liam Neeson's version takes the cake! I will say that if you like musicals, you may get a kick out of this flick. But I think this film is overrated, and it did NOT make me ""cry"".<br/><br/>I really deeply feel the 1998 with both Geoffery Rush and Liam Neeson was atrociously missed by the Academy Awards!<br/><br/>What I felt what the remake's biggest weakness was it was RUSHING over a lot of important plot points of the story, and there was hardly any emotional connection - and just sugar-coated it with all the singing. <br/><br/>I really found it odd that both Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were brought into this; I almost felt Johnny Depp was soon gonna show up! As far as I know, both these two nearly RUINED the movie for me, if was supposed to be FEELING anything serious.<br/><br/>And Anne Hathaway... oh my word, I couldn't LOOK at her, for almost looking like a female Gollum; again, HOW does she become the ""most desirable woman"" after having her teeth pulled & her hair cut??? Neither did I like it when she was singing - I thought she was gonna open her mouth and EAT me. She was *barely* in the movie, but Oscar in hand, bizarrely. (And I'm certain she's rather overrated as an actress, though I kind alike her during her ""Princess Diaries"" years.)<br/><br/>To be fair, this film does have a good score - and have a couple of them on my iPod, but also as well as the soundtrack for the 1998 version.<br/><br/>A lot of the actors, I rather don't really like or care about; and plus, I just can't see Russell Crowe as a bad guy (Javert) - Geoffrey Rush was a WHOLE LOT more convincing as a menacing villain. Eddie Redmayne played a rather dimwitted and less attractive Marius in this version, than the guy back in the 1998 version; he just randomly sees Cosette and and just falls in love; how CLUNKY! And Amanda Seyfried is just another actress I don;t like for her reputation. Just about the whole CAST is unlikable!<br/><br/>Oh and the ""boy who gets shot"" in the story, it really shocked me in the original when the boy got shot by the troops; I gasped, totally saddened. But the boy in this adaptation... oh my HECK was he annoying - all his singing & mannerisms were just undeniable irritating! Instead I was like ""Thank You!"" when he was shot.<br/><br/>And and WHY is the camera man horrible at his work!? Too much close-ups of people's faces, wobbly frame, out of focus shots, etc. Somebody should fire him!<br/><br/>Though many years later, I do thank a Les Miserables remake is necessary, but I think they did a mediocre & clunky job, IMO.<br/><br/>Again, 1998 version was so much better than the 2012 version. The 2012 version was so pushed and in your face like damn it cry already. If you have good acting and good direction you don't need that extra push because it can happen naturally. And more than 50% of the singing in the 2012 version sucked. They chose certain Broadway actors but some weren't and their singing hurt my ears. And if you are going to do a musical don't talk during some of the most beautiful singing parts that was just dumb on their part. The acting was so much more powerful in the 1998 version and they didn't have to sing what was on their mind for you to understand what they were going through. I love the Broadway/concert version too but out of the film adaptations 1998 version is far better than the 2012. <br/><br/>But I talk in full detail about the films compared in this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NiJT9mQzok<br/><br/>The 1998 version is the best!

","Les Misérables of Tom Hooper was a big disappointment. Adapting one of the greatest books of the French literature is risky and hard enough but Tom Hooper decided to complicate things more by adapting the stage musical.<br/><br/>The casting was one of the worst I have ever seen. The musical gathered a big number of great actors but for a musical you need mostly great voices. It is clear that most of the cast do not have singing experience or training. The writers went for a full musical where even small dialogues were sang. At some point, this became irritating because of the poor singing qualities. Except for Samantha Barks (as Eponine) and Colm Wilkinson (as the bishop), I didn't hear anything worth writing about.<br/><br/>Voices aside, the cast was far from being perfect. Hugh Jackman was simply not the right actor to play Jean Valjean. His acting lacked anger and power which I find highly surprising given the number of angry characters he played in previous movies.<br/><br/>I couldn't see Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. She's a good actress but too cold for the role. She couldn't show the vulnerable side of the character.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe and Eddie Redmayne were simply badly miscast. Both have very limited voices and their performance was just not up to expectations.<br/><br/>The only bright side of this movie was the performance of Anne Hathaway and the young Daniel Huttlestone.

I understand that I am in the minority but here is my review to add to the small pile of awful reviews for this movie.<br/><br/>I had heard great things about this movie and so many of my friends raved about it and said how wonderful it was. I was in two minds about whether I would enjoy it but was assured that it was 'my' type of story. I generally really enjoy musicals as well so I went in with an open mind.<br/><br/>I actually part enjoyed the beginning with Valjean and his experience being imprisoned and released on parole. Then Anne Hathaway appeared. While she may have portrayed the character well and I'm not slating her acting, her whole story felt rushed. Her introduction, decline into prostitution and death was dealt with in the space of about 20 minutes. We knew nothing about her other than she had an illegitimate child who she was sending money to and then she was fired, left no choice but to prostitute herself and then she died (from what? heartache?)....and we're supposed to care, why? There may be more of a back story about her in the stage show and if that's the case, it certainly wasn't adapted well here.<br/><br/>I also struggled to understand why Valjean would then dedicate his life to raising Cosette for a woman he didn't even know!? Regardless of whether or not he feels guilty for her death.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron-Cohen provided the comic relief but I didn't realise there were cockneys in Paris in the 1800s....<br/><br/>Javert spent years and years chasing Valjean for breaking parole for a loaf of bread (er...why?) and then committed suicide! Many people said they cried when Eponine died but I felt nothing (I was very bored by this point). I didn't really see the point in her character.<br/><br/>I did struggle with the fact that there was in fact extremely little spoken dialogue. Save for a few, the songs were forgettable and every other word was an extended warble. I'll give credit where it's due and say that Hugh Jackman is a great singer and on the whole the singing wasn't bad but there was too much of it. I felt that if there had been some spoken dialogue, parts of the movie would be explained better, like the French revolution. I got a little lost here as to what they were barricading during the battle.<br/><br/>It was an hour and a half through the film when I found myself incredibly bored and not really connected to any of the characters, but I powered through and really tried to enjoy it but to no avail.<br/><br/>By the end of the film I felt exhausted, frustrated and had an intense headache from the constant warbling throughout."

"cothrige-398-511805","4","3","8","12 January 2013"," Not really terrible, but not at all good either
","After sitting through Les Miserables I left the theatre feeling that much had gone wrong, and ultimately I had to admit that overall it just wasn't a successful motion picture. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't good either.<br/><br/>The main problem is that the filmmakers seemingly either don't like musical theatre, or have no understanding of why it is what it is. And Les Miserables is not just a musical, but a sung through musical, meaning that there is effectively no spoken dialogue. Being such the story is rather different than it would be for other movies or plays. Characters are not really fleshed out that deeply, as they have to be revealed in some forty songs which keeps opportunities for deep development to a minimum. We also do not get many details about why people are doing much of what they are doing, or why this character is or even should be in love with that one.<br/><br/>The reason these things don't normally derail a show like Les Miserables is because of the music and songs. There is great power in music and it can and does fill in emotionally so much of what is missing in the rest of the story. These cardboard cutout characters can move us when they die, or fight for love, because they do so in songs, and in beautiful and powerful songs at that, and this is where the movie flies off the rails. At every chance the actors opt to speak when they should sing, and when they do sing they do it as if reluctantly. Much of the recitative dialogue simply comes of as stilted sing-song speaking, which not only loses the power of the singing but goes further in adding to that a deficiency of sounding like goofy talking. And when the actors do try to sing, they often insist on emoting to the point of ending up off key and out of tune, as Anne Hathaway does in her big number in which she gasps, moans and cries until the song is entirely lost in it all. All the power of the music is gone, and all the acting in the world cannot compensate for the fact that we still know nothing about the character and therefore hardly care about what she is going through. <br/><br/>The director also makes the strange choice of building giant elaborate sets which he refuses to film. Instead we spend most of the movie looking up the actors noses in extreme closeup. And in the moments we are spared this torture we are instead given nauseatingly shaking hand-held camera work. Ultimately, little works in this, and if it weren't for the fine performances of Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks and a few others who actually sing their songs and do so well, there would frankly be little to commend in this. This movie has too much music and singing to be believable or good as a movie, and too little real music and singing to be a good musical."
"amexspam","5","3","8","7 January 2013"," On a per minute basis you got value but
","Well, it was long. It seemed that 95% of the shots were extreme closeups. When I can see whether a whisker was shaved to the skin line or below that's too close with the camera. The problem with the overuse of extreme close-ups is that it lost it's epic story. I get it. The Director wanted to make it different from the stage (and the stage version is far better)and so went for intimacy. But ignoring the majesty of most scenes means this would have presented just as well on my television (Update: I was right, this movie plays better on a TV set). The cast did well, the only exception being Helena B Carter whom I felt was channeling her Sweeney Todd character. Jackman & Crowe were very good, but the runaway performance was Anne Hathaway - hopefully she'll get the Oscar. I think the reason for the high average scores are ratings from young people that haven't seen many movies. Honest, many musicals/operettas are better than this."
"zetes","5","3","8","6 January 2013"," I think I'm the only one, but I hate the music; Hathaway is brilliant, though
","I seem to be alone among the detractors of this film in that I thought Tom Hooper's work was fine on it. I just think the original music, which is supposed to be about the best ever written for a stage musical, to range from mediocre to downright lousy. With the one big exception of ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" which is average, at best, but which is so powerfully delivered by stand-out Anne Hathaway that I was kind of blown away by it, I felt like I was trapped in the same three or four tunes being re-worked over and over again, written as if with a rhyming dictionary in hand and not that well sung by the cast. Pretty much 99% of the film's dialogue is sung, so it should come as no surprise that I kind of hated it. Still, there are a lot of good things about it: besides Russell Crowe, who is poor as Javert, the cast acts well. Again, Hathaway, in particular, is just outstanding. I'll never forget the ""I Dreamed a Dream"" sequence, and, really, the whole film holds up as far less than shear torture simply because that sequence is so damned powerful."
"jwilso24","5","4","13","27 December 2012"," Les Miserables will leave you feeling quite miserable.
","So I know a lot of people will probably disagree with me, but in my mind 'Les Miserables' was a pretty dull affair. The direction seemed a bit strange, with far too many closeups during the songs, often giving the impression they were hiding a pretty obvious fake set in the background (the revolutionary fight scene near the end is a case in point). <br/><br/>For the life of me I couldn't understand why Javert kept walking along precipices - perhaps there was meant to be a symbolism there, but Russell Crowe was so wooden its surprising he wasn't used to barricade the streets of Paris along with the doors and chairs. <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway stole the show, with not much screen time, and following on from her strong performance in the Dark Knight Rises, where she again stole the show, it's hard not to tip her for Best Supporting Actress at any of the Awards coming up in a few months. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Eddie Redmayne were both good, though the real highlight was the comic relief provided by Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen (sans singing), whose scenes livened up what was otherwise, a long, overdrawn affair that could have done with a bit more spoken dialogue (even a minute of it would suffice!) rather than 2 1/2 hours of songs that were largely unnecessary. (THEY GOT THE MUSTARD OUT!)<br/><br/>Overall, if you like maudlin operas that leave you melancholy and enjoy a complete lack of facial expression, this movie is for you. Otherwise, go and see Argo. 2 1/2 stars."

","The singing voices of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe will start to nauseate you about halfway through this tortuously lengthy musical version of one of the most oft-filmed novels in cinema history. The story of Valjean (Jackman) looking for redemption after having served time in prison under the watchful eye of Javert(Crowe), becoming a mayor, but continuously running from Javert who is obsessively chasing Valjean, wanting to exact some revenge. I can't help wondering why on earth it was decided to sing virtually every line. I'm convinced that the talented actors (NOT singers), would have been perfectly capable of lending their own sense of melody and rhythm to the words by simply saying them the way an actor would. There's a lot of tears, a lot of loud music comprising a rather dull and, literally, monotonous soundtrack. You know you're in trouble when the specials effects in the opening scene are as true to life as Postman Pat. A complete and utter bore."

","Based on the successful West End musical this film tells the story of Jean Valjean. In 1815 he is released from prison after serving nineteen years for the theft of a loaf of bread and trying to escape. As he is released prison guard Javert tells him that he will be on parole for the rest of his life and must always carry papers that list his crimes. Once out he tries to steal from a bishop but is caught... surprisingly the bishop gives him a second chance, telling the arresting officers that he'd given Valjean the stolen item. Given a second chance he destroys his papers and makes a new life.<br/><br/>Eight years later he has become mayor of a town, where he runs a factory employing many people. Then one day a new police chief arrives; none other than Javert. Javert soon suspects him as the man who broke parole all those years before. While this is going on Fantine, a woman working in the factory, is fired by the foreman. She is forced into a life of prostitution to support her daughter, Cosette. Things go from bad to worse for her; she has a run-in with the law but is helped by Valjean; then, as she lies dying he promises to look after Cosette. Javert is now hard on his trail so he flees once more taking Cosette to Paris.<br/><br/>Another nine years pass, Cosette has grown up and revolution is in the air. One revolutionary falls in love with Cosette and Valjean is concerned that he will lose her. Then Javert turns up again; still determined to arrest Valjean.<br/><br/>I must state that I have neither seen the stage version nor read the book so can't say how this compares; however I can say that I enjoyed the film. The story is solid and while there is much tragedy there is also some humour, much of it provided by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen who are great as the dishonest couple who initially looked after Cosette then keep turning up like a couple of bad pennies. Hugh Jackman really impresses as protagonist Jean Valjean and Russell Crowe is equally solid as Javert... I'd heard his singing wasn't good but it sounded fine to me. The rest of the cast was solid; most notably Anne Hathaway, who picked up an Oscar for her portrayal of the doomed Fantine and Amanda Seyfried and Isabelle Allen who play the older and younger Cosette. The songs are good with some really stirring numbers. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; even if you aren't a fan of musicals the story is solid enough to make it worth watching."

","Les Miserables in one of the best stage musicals ever made.

Jackman was light-musical and it really didn't cut it....<br/><br/>Crowe was wooden and completely miscast. That's a part that a good actor could flesh out, but Rusty was complete underwhelming. His voice was nothing to write home about. <br/><br/>Marius, Enjorlas,... fairly weak when they should project a bit of power and substance. Anna Hathaway was OK, but the part of Fontine is strange. It does not feature in most of the show, yet often draws praise. Didn't deserve the Oscar.<br/><br/>The most dreadful aspect was the Thenardiers. Sasha and Helen BC had limitless opportunities to give a great injection of comic relief and really have fun with it. Instead, they ended up totally stale, uninspired and somewhat creepy. The actors almost skipped over (Rather than emphasize) their great lines. <br/><br/>In the end, this was a real disappointment for someone who was a big fan. Didn't even think much of the sets and staging. What they should have done is made a movie using a good ensemble cast built of Les Mis stage performers from around the world. Bringing in the big names actually backfired on this occasion."

Hugh Jackman tries his best but his amateurish singing! How could his Bring him home stay in the movie? Eddie Redmayne makes Nick Jonas - earnest and likable Marius with mediocre nasal voice - sound like Michael Ball. There are many great Fantines, Ruthie Henshall maybe the best. Anne Hathaway, however, is irritating. Yes, as a tortured, dying prostitute FANTINE has reason to cry and moan, but this is - wait for it - musical.

Tom Hooper is a very capable director but getting untrained voices to handle this score was a total mistake. It is constantly painful to hear them simply barking out the lines, and it's not helped by the fact that the lines themselves are so thoroughly banal. The excellent acting, detailed recreation of 19th c. France and brooding drama of Hugo's great tale do not succeed in overcoming the agony of the so-called singing, which ruined some fine songs (though in truth there are not that many).

It's a tale of love and loss, of obsession and hatred played out against the background of revolutionary France, and it's quite simply the best musical to come along for a good few years.<br/><br/>Much of the delight comes from the central pairing of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, both of whom are better than they've been for a good while. Each actors gives it his all, and they fill their roles with nobility, honour and feeling. I like the supporting cast less - Anne Hathaway is nothing to write home about in my mind, and didn't really deserve that Oscar - but Amanda Seyfried is better than she was in MAMMA MIA and Eddie Redmayne is reliable as always.<br/><br/>As a film, LES MISERABLES looks splendid, and THE KING'S SPEECH director Tom Hooper puts every penny of the budget up on screen. The songs are memorable and very well sung by the entire cast, and although I could have done without Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter (both of whom seem to be repeating their parts from SWEENEY TODD) they're not too off-putting.

","I love literature, and I love French writer Victor Hugo who gave the world gems like The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Miserables, on which this musical is based.<br/><br/>Personally, I do not like musicals, but I decided to watch this adaptation to see what the fuss is all about(considering that I never completely finished reading the novel). Within the first seconds, I was bombarded with singing that instantly turned me off. I love the story, but it was just too over-the-top with the singing, it absolutely made me cringe, especially when Russell Crowe started to sing. His interpretation of the Inspector Javert character was completely bland. For me, the singing removed away the dramatic significance of some of the scenes, such as when Jean Valjean (played by Hugh Jackman)met the bishop who gave him the two candlesticks. Furthermore, the singing throughout the movie is merely for pure entertainment and removes the significance of dialogue in the interactions that the characters make, because dialogue has been replaced with singing (yes, I know its a musical) and it makes the whole thing extremely superficial.<br/><br/>I don't know why I was expecting much from this pretentious piece of cinema that somehow butchers a great piece of literature. I would rather look for the 2000 French mini-series and watch it again.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this movie were the amazing, excellent performances of Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Anne Hathaway as the whore Fantine, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as the comical, thieving, greedy Thenardiers. The fact that Hugh Jackman lost weight and practiced singing for the role shows that he is indeed a well rounded character. Anne Hathaway did indeed deserve and Oscar for her role here which she plays with such emotion; she stands out among the whole cast. As for the rest, beginning with Crowe as Javert and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, their portrayals are nothing to write home about. Russell Crowe's singing is horrendous, and his character here seems to have no purpose because the signing fails to establish any reasonable context to the actions that the characters take and what they are doing what they are doing.<br/><br/>The setting and costumes were also OK."

","I am previously familiar with neither book nor stage version. The same criticisms (and of course praise) dog it since the 1860s as I read: bombastic, simplistic, manipulative. Baudelaire praised the book's social indictment but called the writing 'tasteless and inept'. <br/><br/>The public each time voted with their money; people like what they like and that is that. So let's see something else, cinematic.<br/><br/>It's the camera that appeals to me, this is the subjective camera that hovers around the characters, sometimes floats or swirls with the action. Calling attention to itself as present in the film, this camera is unlike the smooth, invisible one favored by old Hollywood and classic musicals, it is from a radically different cinematic tradition much more interesting to me.<br/><br/>I have noticed that it's being used in a variety of recent films, down to Snow White & Huntsman, I believe the film responsible for bringing it back in the vocabulary in a big way is Malick's Tree of Life. Malick of course did not invent it, but he's been doing the most high- profile work as of late in this mode. I'm eagerly anticipating his next batch of films as the next step forward, we'll see.<br/><br/>Previous landmark instances of this camera include, 1) Soviet films like Soy Cuba (Kalatozov) and Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (Parajanov), 2) Welles in Chimes and a variety of projects, and back to France in the silent era, 3) Menilmontant (Kirsanof), A Propos de Nice (Vigo) or your choice of Epstein. Great films all, a bit different than the norm, that I recommend to you.<br/><br/>It hasn't been always used to consciously the same effect, but it can achieve a few great things, at least Malick knows this; it can immerse you in the world of the film as a pair of eyes, it can discover the space of the story, in the silent era they filmed in this way to create 'city symphonies', and linked to both create something like memory or daydream.<br/><br/>So my problem is not that it's overly sentimental. The same can be said about Malick. Both this and his Tree are lush cinematic symphonies. Both films are structured as people being 'reborn' into previous or next lives. Both films end with sweeping visions of inter-connected souls in some afterlife.<br/><br/>The opening shot is pretty astonishing, we start underwater beneath a French flag, swim up and jump fifty feet in the air to see a galleon being impossibly tugged by grimy prisoners. So there's great potential in the camera, the songs are catchy as hell and as they later recur in the film, you have memories of them as memories of the characters' previous lives. <br/><br/>So it's interesting that it goes nowhere. It's all average here, nothing submerged—all you need to know or see is loudly splashed on you, bucket after bucket of spent youth, injustice, the redemption that love affords and sacrifice it demands. We will see a lot more Oscar bait from this Hooper.<br/><br/>Whereas Malick shines a fragile light to a fragile reality, this drowns and flattens.<br/><br/>It's like being in a rally, rousing for a while but tiresome because you're not getting anything done, you're not getting to know anyone, and the slogans seems more and more mindless and simplistic, a waste of energy."

Personally, I didn't expect to see Sascha Baron- Cohen in a musical film such as this, but his appearance was quite good. I think that ""Les Miserables"" could be considered as a very realistic presentation of what life was like in 19th century France. The songs performed during the film were very beautiful and the performances delivered by the whole cast were heartfelt and really moving.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching even if you're not a fan of the musical genre."
"raj-sahu7777","5","2","5","3 March 2013"," Brilliant cinema mixed with some long and intensely boring sequences.
","I don't understand how the director could not see that he was stretching some scenes way beyond their true width (life if you will). I felt (at times)""miserable"" watching this movie (which I believe is based on a) French classic. I felt there were some others in the theater who were bored to death by some boring cinema in the initial 45 minutes. And then walks in Mr Sacha ""Borat"" Cohen and everything changes suddenly! Boy did I need some comic relief! And he RICHLY provides that--- Haven't seen a more natural and brilliant comedienne after Peter Sellers( of pink panther fame)<br/><br/>I do think the actors knew (and smelled) the opportunity of grabbing an Oscar and most of them performed brilliantly. Hathaway, Jackman, Crowe were all brilliant as were most of the other actors--- it's just that I don't know their names :( I know it's not easy to like musicals; but then are some who just love it. The songs and music are MIND BOGGLING-LY beautiful--- even haunting. The climax brought about a lump in my throat-- a lump which refused to go away well after I had exited the theater. The importance of FORGIVENESS is one of the (foremost) messages. The spirit of the French revolution made me get the goose bumps. Amazing! This book(Les Miserables) was part of our course in my bachelor of commerce program, way back in eighties when I was in college in India. Since I didn't attend classes (guilty as charged!), I am grateful to the producers for this eternal and evergreen French classic (even though it's made the puhfectly British way!)"

","India doesn't get to see Musicals often. So when Les Miserables came in theaters here in India, I had a reason to cheer. Les Miserables is not a movie but a piece of cinematic expression that will forever linger in your mind. The casting could not have been better.<br/><br/>Hugh, Russell, Anne, Amanda, Eddie and all the others have convincingly portrayed their parts and sung their lines. It was all so magical. Despite the long running time of the picture, I found it engaging and engrossing. I never knew the story of Les Miserables and this was the first time that I got to see this epic story on screen. <br/><br/>Tom Hooper has done an incredible job as a director. He brings an unforgettable musical on screen. <br/><br/>Cinematography, Make-up, Costumes, Hair Styles, Production Design and Sound are all perfect. Indians are flattered to see this tale of fight, dream, love and hope. A must watch for all of the world."

","It is an ambitious film with a lot of expectation. Not only is one of the most popular novels by the biggest French author in literature, but it is the most popular musical of all-time. Which, being produced in the 80's and 90's where musicals are way past their golden age is really saying something! Les Misérables is set in 19th century Paris and tells the story of Jean Valijean, who has just been released on parole after a 19-year stint in the chain gangs for robbing a house to feed his starving family. Upon release, the officer Javert, warns him not to break his parole and that the papers he carry will always brand him a thief. Valijean realises that to change his life he has to break parole and Javert thus vows to hunt him down and bring him to justice.<br/><br/>First the good things - it looks amazing. It really captures the sights, sounds and smells of old Paris. The introduction is particularly epic. Costumes are amazing and very authentic looking.<br/><br/>It was well directed and well-shot and if it was a normal film, it might have worked.<br/><br/>However, if you are a fan musicals in general, you will be very disappointed. It is not sung with any musical legitimacy. The aim is to pull everything back to sound like people are speaking normally to each other. Sometimes it is effective, but over the whole time period of the movie, it becomes boring and monotonous and you just wish that people would just speak instead.<br/><br/>And they do... there is no dialogue in the original (which is sung all the way through like grand opera), but heaps of music is cut for dialogue... but it doesn't make the movie any shorter as sometimes the dialogue takes longer than the original music does! There are also a lot of alterations to keys of songs and to certain passages to suit singers - particularly Hugh Jackman's (Jean Valijean) part.<br/><br/>I was fine with the cuts when they cut out all the obviously theatrical elements ie. inner monologues or exposition through song. But a lot of other cuts stripped so much from the characters. Eponine and all of the students were completely undeveloped. Most of the new music was rehashing and repeating themes that were already there. Most of the new text was invariably not as well written as the original text.<br/><br/>As for performances - there are a couple of great performances and a lot of very average ones.<br/><br/>The standout was Anne Hathaway was absolutely phenomenal. She is the best Fantine I have ever seen or heard. She looks just like you expect Fantine to look! She does something really unique with the music. It is a harrowing performance and it was a really good choice from the director to add the particularly disturbing section from the novel that is left out of the musical.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is the most believable Valijean I have seen on stage or screen - not only physically believable (which is a very tough ask given how he is described in the book) but he was really immersed into the character. A very fine, noble and nuanced performance. I was frustrated that he couldn't sing it and that they had to change a lot of the music. However, if you don't know Les Miserables already, you won't notice it until his big song ""Bring Him Home"" at the barricade, where they made the unfortunate choice to keep it in its original (high tenor) key.<br/><br/>I was really worried when I'd heard who they had cast as the Thernadiers, the evil heart of the story, but I was really surprised by Sascha Baron Cohen and especially Helena Bonham Carter as the Thernadiers - Sascha Baron's quasi-Greek Italian accent aside. Helena Bonham Carty sings much better in this than in Sweeney Todd. They were suitably nasty, but they managed to balance it with humour. With all the new dialogue, songs etc. the Thernadiers were unfortunately not given more. There is a LOT more in the book.<br/><br/>He gets a lot of negative rap, but Russell Crowe had good moments when he wasn't attempting to ""sing"", but he doesn't have the training for this role. It's a killer. As soon as he had to do some real singing, his acting suffered. It's a shame - he has a nice voice, he fits the part and I reckon if he really trained he'd be fabulous.<br/><br/>He was by no means the worst singer - I was more impressed with him than with Marius), Cosette and Eponine. Eponine was the only one in the movie who pronounced Cosette as Koe-sett... obviously listened to Gary Morris on the complete symphonic recording one too many times.<br/><br/>After Fantine's part in the story ends and we get past the Innkeeper's spectacular opening scene - it is probably time to leave the theater.<br/><br/>The second half is a mess. The cuts really killed the pace and the impact of the story. I just didn't care about the students or Eponine as we never got to meet them... they were just underdeveloped. A lot of things went unexplained - e.g. what are the students fighting for? Why is it important? why is Thernadier the innkeeper robbing houses? Oh wait... the explanations was cut... it is NOT the fault of the musical.<br/><br/>As much as I love the musical, I never need to watch this version again unfortunately. I only hope that when I next see it on stage, I don't see people attempting to perform it in this way!"
"thejilliebean16","Null","2","5","22 February 2013"," As an original fan of the Broadway musical, I say eh.
","Truthfully Les Mis was not what I had expected it to be. As a fan of the musical, I did go into the movie theater knowing that the movie can't live up to all of my expectations. In some ways it exceeded them and in others, I was disappointed. <br/><br/>The Pros: 1) Anne Hathaway was perfect. Her version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" brought me to tears and I truly could feel her pain. If she doesn't win the Oscar for her role, I will be extremely upset. 2) Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit both played their parts wonderfully. 3) I was pleasantly surprised Russell Crowe could sing and do a decent job at it. 4) The scenery and filming style was well done. They couldn't properly convey such things on the stage. 5) While they couldn't keep certain elements from the stage show like the stars revolving during ""Stars"", and the amazing affect of Javert jumping off the bridge to his death, they kept the scene of Enjolras hanging out of the window, so I was pleased. 6) I was thrilled when Colm Wilkinson appeared as The Bishop. I was very proud. 7) The ending rendition of ""Do You Hear The People Sing"" featuring all of those who had perished throughout the film was marvelous and very well done. <br/><br/>The Cons: 1) All but one of my Cons have to do with Hugh Jackman's performance, to which I thought fell completely flat. I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I love Hugh Jackman, but he was wrong for the part of Valjean. 2) For one thing, Jackman was not the proper age to play Valjean. Even at the end as an old man he still looked far too young, and in my opinion, I'd rather have had him be older and look a little too old for Younger Valjean, as opposed to having him looking too young for the older Valjean. 3) Second, Hugh Jackman also lacked the proper physicality, he appeared too small and even later when he appeared to be larger, his face looked too small for his body. He also should have had a beard the whole time, not just when he was in prison. 4) Lastly, and most importantly, Hugh Jackman completely lacked the vocal talents to play Valjean. He required more of a classical style voice and required less belting at softer moments. His rendition of ""Bring Him Home"" was pitiful. The style of song is a soft prayer and he just belted it out loud and proud. I felt more like his performance was a half baked attempt between Curly from Oklahoma and Valjean. Ultimately I was not pleased with the outcome. 5) This isn't really a con, but in light of all the other performances I commended in the Pros, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne's performances lost my attention a bit. Still very strong portrayals and vocal talents, but they didn't stand out to me as much as others did. <br/><br/>All in all, I give it a 7. It could have been better."

","I have had a lot of good comments about this movie. May be my expectation is too high and I found this movie very disappointing. I don't think it works as a movie. <br/><br/>The singing was horrible for a few actors. Surely there must be some better actors in signing than ..... what you have got here?! And it is painfully annoying to listen to the actors signing out their lines when they are not even in tune! honestly, cant you just SAY it instead of adding some incorrect melody to how you speak? <br/><br/>The whole story could be told and finished in 5 mins. And more importantly the whole story does not make sense like seriously, a girl meet a boy once and fell in love, wanting to be with him forever?!??! And Javert just gone and kill himself?!?! Waste of my time and pain to my ears! It will work as a musical but as a movie, its STUPID! <br/><br/>The movie was like 2.30 hours long but the whole thing seems rush!

"johnvlachos14","Null","2","5","8 February 2013"," A mediocre adaptation of the stage musical.
","Couldn't wait to watch this film but now that I did I can't say that I'm impressed... My biggest objection was the casting of Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman as the movie's leading characters. Crowe's acting and singing was disastrous. Jackman's performance was convincing enough but his voice wasn't what someone would call captivating... ''Les Miserables'' is a musical filled with overly emotional and heartfelt songs consequently great acting and singing skills are required to transmit these emotions to the viewer. That wasn't the case here. Rest of the cast did a great job especially Anne Hathaway and the girl who portrayed Eponine. <br/><br/>Another issue I had was the director's obsession with close ups during the actors' singing performances. This would have done the trick had the actors possessed better acting and singing skills. It worked for Hathaway but not the aforementioned duo. It also made the overall movie experience feel a bit boring and uninspired. Beautiful sets and a bit of body language (a little dancing maybe?) instead of constant close ups would have made the film more pleasant to watch.<br/><br/>Finally the pacing felt a bit rushed and made the story seem somehow implausible; Characters and their emotions felt totally underdeveloped (Marius and Cosette fell madly in love with each other right after they shared their first 'hello'!!!). <br/><br/>All in all, the movie was O.K. (not bad) but having watched the stage musical a few months ago (which is spectacular by the way) I must say it felt like a missed opportunity. A not so talented director and a few miscasts killed this one (6 out of 10)."
"plasticanimalz","4","2","5","27 January 2013"," Clearly the 10 Stars Where Paid for by the Studio
","This film was such a waste. I was excited to see it...then heard it did not get such great reviews. I even heard my friend who is so obsessed with the play he even got a Les Miserables tattoo, that even he hated the film. Knowing Anne Hathaway's voice and acting talent I was willing to give it a shot. Well, she's not actually in that much of the film, which was a shame, because she was one of the few good people in this film. First of all, I did not know they would sing 95% of the film and almost never talk...which was a bit awkward and not typical of musicals. This would have been fine if Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe were not the two main leads who sang the bulk of the film beyond poorly. Russel Crowe has the equivalent singing talent of Alec Baldwin in 'Rock of Ages,' but at least that was meant to be a joke. Hugh Jackman does not have a voice suite for musicals at all! It was so unbearable...and never stopped that I had to finally walk out of the film during one of his numbers. I'm sure he can sing but not everyone is meant to sing at this caliber. Once you finally get to the part with the young rebels do you actually get to hear the voices that SHOULD be in the film (other than Anne Hathaway). They were amazing. Anne Hathaway and the girl who gets shot both made me teary eyed with their voices and final song. Amazing. And the guy who likes Collete, Eddie something or other is his acting name...beautiful voice. And Amanda Seifried is also pretty good and can handle her own with these amazing voices. Once you hear them you feel cheated that you had to sit through non-stop Hugh and Russel sounding like dualing grizzly bears. So, after hearing these amazing voices and getting interested in their stories, once Hugh starting singing like a howler monkey again, I had to leave. I don't know how they even got cast. Like, why would you kill one of the biggest musicals of all time by putting two big star names on it who can't carry a musical? People who don't like musicals aren't going to see it for these two guys and people who do like musicals aren't going to care about the star power. Not to mention, in 'Moulin Rouge' they cast two people who can actually sing! Though, Les Miserables really is for the trained singer who is good enough to be on Broadway, and not just anyone. What a disappointing flop ruined by Hollywood. And honestly, there was nothing really enchanting about this film other than a few good performances. It kind of reminded me of 'Eat, Pray, Love,' also a train wreck, where the majority of the film is about seeing Julia Roberts when what you want to see is all of the beautiful locations. Same goes for this film. All the focus was on Russel and Hugh and there wasn't that much focus on Paris! Come on. The film is about war torn Paris. Shouldn't we see more of the actual city? The guy who directed this film is clearly a novice who somehow talked his way into something that was way over his head."
"mad_mandonna","7","2","5","22 January 2013"," Half masterpiece, half mediocrity.
","I really wanted to love this film, some of the songs and characters are some of the best in any musical and the story is engrossing and very sad. I personally have not seen the stage show, so my comments are from reading the book (which was years ago and I can barely remember it) and on the films own merits.<br/><br/>Generally the film hits all the bases; the drama is spot on, he comedy is dabbed here and there and songs are in their truest form. Where the film really takes flight is on the lead performance by Hugh Jackman whom is both staggeringly honest and extremely well sung (even if his voice begins to grate towards the end). Anne Hathaway steals the entire show in the mere 10 minutes of screen time she has - and she owns it - in fact the film often loses its way without her. The young actress Samantha Barks is also very good and her version of the famous ""on my own"" is stunning.<br/><br/>But where there is good there is bad, Russel Crowe being the worst offender. He neither has the acting ability nor the vocal capacity to pull off the role he is given and his songs sound more strained than the other vocalists. Amanda Seyfried also seems miscast, she has no chemistry with her males leads and her vocals sound terrible by comparison of Hathaway's or Bark's.<br/><br/>In other areas the film generally works, the pitiful CGI at the start not withstanding the scenery is a sight to behold. Such a shame the director has no time to really have a look at it. The camera work is a little too erratic for my personal liking and barely gives the audience time to breathe between the mood changes.<br/><br/>This does sound more negative than positive, but the negatives luckily don't take too much away from the general enjoyment of the film. It will likely tug on many people's heart strings but for myself I think a better director could have made this so much more."
"neil-476","9","2","5","16 January 2013"," Excellent but not perfect
","I'm a big movie fan: sadly, the missus isn't. She is, however, a big fan of musical theatre in general and Les Mis in particular, so this film was a must-see for both of us. I'm a fairly recent convert to Les Mis (the 25th anniversary performance in concert at the O2 did it for me), and I've been looking forward to the film for months.<br/><br/>So what did we think of the film of the show of the book? Heaven knows that Hugo's novel of Jean Valjean's life adapts well to the screen, there have been enough versions of it. But this is an adaptation of the show, not the book.<br/><br/>On the whole, it has been done extremely well. Cinema can do two things which a stage presentation can't - it can give you panorama, and it can give you intimacy. Tom Hooper's film does both - from the opening sequence in the docks to the superb finale, we are clearly not on stage. And, for much of the important songs, the performers are given close-ups which you wouldn't get in the theatre no matter how good your seats were.<br/><br/>This ties in with the songs being performed rather than sung: in some ways this is a little difficult to get used to - there is an element of expecting stage performance, which is not at all how they are presented - but this is more than made up for by the immediacy and direct connection to the emotion of the pieces.<br/><br/>In common with a lot of people, we were not convinced that Russell Crowe was the Javert we expected to see or hear, but most of the rest of the casting was good, with Jackman, Hathaway and Redmayne standing out (likewise with the singing: Barks and the students were also very good, Seyfried was a bit over-twittery for me).<br/><br/>If you don't like musicals, it may convert you. The music is tried and tested, with at least half a dozen proved showstoppers. And there is a mountain of solid emotion here - my chin quivered and my eyes brimmed for a material percentage of the running time.<br/><br/>It has too many flaws to be considered perfect, but it is very good indeed.<br/><br/>Original review 16 Jan: update 19 Feb. My third viewing was in the company of hard-as-nails music teacher Mary and her 11 year old daughter Daisy. As predicted, not a tear from Mary and, also as predicted, floods from Daisy. But both thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the music was fantastic.<br/><br/>I Dreamed A Dream is not the powerful show-stopping ballad we all thought it was: it is 3 minutes of raw pain set to music."
"iwilliams8","9","2","5","11 January 2013"," Absolutely Fantastic - Excluding Mr Crowe
","What a fantastic film! Tom Hooper's direction allows for so much subtlety and emotion that the stage show, as fantastic as it is, never can achieve. On stage the cast have to be big and bold throughout filling the large theatre space. Tom Hooper's frequent use of close-ups and steadicam work enabled the cast to show so much more detail in their portrayal of the various characters in Victor Hugo's novel. This is a version of Les Miserables unlike any other and works superbly.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was superb as the ex-convict Jean Valjean and portrays the various stages of Valjean's life with great believability. I had reservations about the casting of Anne Hathaway as Fantine but it did not take long for me to be won over. I'm not ashamed to say that I was welling up with her rendition of ""Come to Me"". All credit must be given to Daniel Huttlestone and Isabelle Allen as the young talent in the film playing Gavroche and the Cosette respectively. It was a nice touch to cast Colm Wilkinson as the Bishop as it was he who played the lead role of Valjean in the original stage version over 25 years ago.<br/><br/>The film was well made and the alternative style of recording the cast singing was hugely beneficial to the overall performance. However, it has to be said that Russell Crowe was woefully miscast. It's true that the guy can sing – but he cannot act and sing simultaneously. Every other member of the cast without exception put so much emotion and power behind their individual singing performances but Mr Crowe just sang each song in a completely uninteresting way. His greatest offence of this nature was in the Javert solo ""Stars"" which, when performed correctly, can be wonderfully emotive and actually generate some audience-felt compassion for the character. Russell destroyed the role and completely failed to match the quality of Jackman. The actors playing Valjean and Javert should be equally matched in performance power so that you feel it is a constant battle between them and could go either way. Hugh Jackman is far superior to Russell Crowe and the energy between them is completely lost.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne did his best to lift the wet-drip character of Marius to another level and mostly succeeds in doing so. Personally, I found his singing voice much ""thicker-sounding"" than all of the other cast and at times it seemed out of place, but he gave a sterling performance all the same.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen provide the comic relief and do so successfully – although it did feel at times that their scenes were plucked straight out of Sweeney Todd. Does Helena wear the same wig for every film she's in? Samantha Barks is utterly convincing as the tragic Eponine. If you didn't know this was her first film, you'd think she'd been performing in front of a camera all her life. ""A Little Fall of Rain"" has always been a favourite song of this reviewer and I enjoyed it more so than ""On My Own"" which is the usual crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>If you are unfamiliar with the stage version or indeed the book upon which it is based, this film rattles along very quickly in parts and it can be a little tricky to keep up with the story – particularly in the first half hour or so.<br/><br/>If you can tolerate Russell Crowe's dreadful performance, this film is still well worth seeing – it's certainly deserving of one or two or ten awards."

","Reading all the reviews on here made me think that either it would be a nightmare to watch, or I would love this musical movie version of Les Mis. I loved it. I have known the storyline years and years, reading the novel, watching the late '90-ies movie and watched the musical play numerous times. I was excited to watch the trailer, was excited to hear which actors were cast for what part, so to be honest, I could not wait to go an finally see the movie.<br/><br/>Most of the actors are absolutely great with for me the exception of Russel Crowe. Neither his acting, nor his singing lives up to the standard that all the others easily reach. Hugh Jackman is just perfect, his acting is stunning and his voice is quite good, His version of 'Bring Him Home' is simply very emotional. Anne Hathaway is also breathtaking, really superb and highly emotional version of 'I Dreamed A Dream'. It hits you in the face and you believe every note she sings. Eddie Redmayne is also really good, his version of Marius is energetic, really charming and you can see in his eyes what he feels. Brilliant actor.<br/><br/>The director's choice to have the actors sing live, while they play the scenes is for me personally a brilliant choice. This way the meaning of the lyrics are absolutely believable and it pulls the viewer into the story. I love the close-ups, the scenery..in short I love the movie.<br/><br/>You have to like musical theater to like this movie, and you have to like historic drama as well. If you do, this movie will not disappoint, if you don't you should not bother to go and see it. I will go and see it again and again. 9/10"

","I'd like to first say that I have been a fan of Les Mis since I first sang it in my ninth grade chorus class. I have seen the play five times, owned the cds, watched (numerous times) the televised concert etc. So, to say that I walked into the theatre with a highly critical eye, is an understatement. I wasn't sure how I would feel about 'actors' being cast and their voices 'measuring up' to the songs.<br/><br/>This being said, from the moment the movie opened and the first song was sang - my mind was immediately put at ease. I thought the movie version was absolutely wonderful. The actors were cast perfectly and the songs were delivered beautifully and with much emotion. Did Hugh Jackson sing 'Bring Him Home' as perfectly as it was sung on Broadway? No. But - I still managed to love it. The movie did 'its own thing' - yet, still managed to capture the essence of the Broadway production. Where the movie may have lacked in musical ability (and it really didn't lack much in my opinion) it made up for in the acting. <br/><br/>I thought Anne Hathaway gave an amazing performance as Fantine - brought tears to my eyes. When I first saw Hugh Jackson in the opening scene at the jail - he looked so unrecognizable. I wasn't sure if he could achieve the 'look' that Jean Valjean should have. But, he certainly did not disappoint. He possessed the perfect 'strong' aura that Jean Valjean always had. And I felt for him throughout the whole film. Sacha Baron Cohen was great as the innkeeper - his musical ability surprised me - and he had me laughing (would you expect less from him?) Eddie Madrayne was perfectly cast for Marius - and I had doubts when I first saw him on screen. I always remembered Marius being tall, 'dark' and handsome. And Eddie Madrayne - with his freckled face - just didn't seem to fit. But, again - he evoked such emotion and his voice was so beautiful that I now cant imagine somebody else playing that role. I left the movie in tears and so did my sister. Anybody who criticized this movie, is not opening their mind. This is NOT a Broadway play - this is a MOVIE. Therefore, it is NOT going to be exactly the same or evoke the same energy. You have to see it for what it is - a movie; a musical. And - enjoy it. I certainly did."

This is definitely one of his best performances. His transition in appearance as the prisoner and then as a wealthy gentleman is commendable. Anne Hathaway too delivered one of her best performances. These two have really good chance at the Oscars. Russell Crowe was quite disappointing and has really lost his Gladiator magic. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter gave plenty of laughs to the audience.

","Warning there are major spoilers: I saw this movie in theaters and I just have to say it was amazing. Just wonderful and perfect and marvelous and words unable to describe it. I was mind blown. This movie is better than Lincoln. Some movies I have seen were hard to follow and some I couldn't understand. Others had a scene or two that were unneeded or made no sense; but in the two and a half hours I saw, I understood every line and every scene perfectly without doubt. I would love to write a synopsis for this film or answer any questions (email me: jurassickid97@gmail.com). Luckily I was learning about the French Revolution the day before which gave me a little background on the movie. Not much but I knew the poor people are the Third Estate and revolted because of famine. Most of the dialog in the movie was singing which didn't really bother me and that's the only reason it can be considered a musical. There were no random moments of singing and dancing. Also, the actors were phenomenal; all of them. I've always known Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine and figured he would be sucky in a musical albeit he was the best actor in the movie and did an amazing job. Russel Crowe, however, was also a great actor and with my obsession and utter admiration for villains, his role as the antagonist, Javert, was great and showed great villainous qualities. The way he hunted Jackman's character down (for stealing bread, running away and refusing parole) and showed no mercy even after Jackman saved him, showed forgiveness and let him live after years of hunting him made him a good villain. But then, my favorite scene, was when he stood on the bridge and looked into the waterfall rapids and decided to jump off was amazing and just perfect. I loved that scene so much. I really did. Not only did he fall off a tremendous height into the crashing rapids but he plummeted into the concrete edge of the waterfall. It was cruel and violent and just so intense. Unlike Lincoln whereas the assassination of Abe was anticlimactic and kind of disappointing. This suicide was very climatic and gut-wrenching and was just perfect.<br/><br/>All the little scenes were also amazing like the wars, love triangles (a ""Ducky"" from Pretty in Pink character in the triangle) and the minor characters. They adapted the film. Such as the innkeeper and landlord with all their corrupt ways in the inn. Like the whores, pigs and drunks living there and the landlady kissing all the men but her husband and her drunk and poor mannered husband all the while where they made food made from sludge and garbage and stole from anyone they saw. These were mere scum people where they also used children for labor and pretend to love them when a man comes to generously buy one (reminded me of Annie). The movie was in a span of around thirty years which made it amazing also. The best concept of the movie was definitely the serious and intense cruelty and gruel images of it. Such as the war where they killed a young child, the streets of blood puddles, murdering of all the boys in the revolution, the suicide, deaths in general and the crazy scene in the beginning with the prostitution and bodily sacrifices. These scenes made the movie that much better and gave it the true terror and insanity. This movie was truly amazing and one of my favorites. 10/10. Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed my review."
"StevePulaski","6","2","5","30 December 2012"," I dreamed a lesser dream
","I was advised a day prior to seeing Tom Hooper's Les Misérables to search up and watch the 25th anniversary concert performance of Les Misérables, performed at The O2 in London in October 2010. The performance of three hours was spellbinding, with one lavish song after another captivating even the most distanced viewer with its monumentally talented singers and their brave, audacious vocals. While not a single number was disappointing, Lea Salonga's version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was simply beautiful and mosaic, without being too emotionally dictative or manipulating. It has the right tone, and Salonga herself didn't appear to be trying to garner anything outside of a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>All I can say is that because of enduring a lengthy orchestra, performing the sounds of Victor Hugo's timeless novel, is that Hooper's countless film adaptation suffers by comparison. The story should be familiar now; it's 1815, in a dark and grim France, where convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) has been released from prison, yet will still remain under the eye of prison guard Javert (Russell Crowe). After inhabiting a life of crime, Valjean decides to assume a life of good, and we fast-forward nine years later, where he now owns a factory.<br/><br/>We soon focus on one of his workers, a young woman named Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who has been sending much of her wages to her illegitimate daughter, Cosette (Isabelle Allen). She is quickly fired after a fight and forced to succumb to losing some of her teeth and her hair just to get the bare minimum to service her daughter, who is living with the Thénardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). The remainder of the film centers on the eccentric stories of others in France, during a time of economic uncertainty and political grayness. Everyone is miserable, everyone is dirty, and it seems no one can choose a path for happiness.<br/><br/>This is only the umpteenth time this story has been adapted into a film, and who better to do it than Tom Hooper, right? The man directed The King's Speech, a strong, well-made picture which went on to win the 2010 Best Picture Oscar, no competition. Hooper decides to go even more stylistic with Les Misérables than he did that effort, and this is what presents the film with its almost fatal flaw. Hooper directs this picture with a very intimate, yet uncomfortable look, which has long, ponderous close-ups of actors, singing their hearts out to this material. From the first sequence of this, during ""Valjean's Soliloquy,"" the videography of the music felt unnatural and slightly awkward. I kept an open mind, believing that it's just the fact I've seen so many musicals that show dancing and atmosphere on a grandscale, only about halfway through when I found this to be a genuine distraction. Occasionally, it comes in handy, like during the ""I Dreamed a Dream"" number by Anne Hathaway, which has the audience deeply focused on her as she sings her heart out to one of the saddest ballads in recent memory. But for the most part, it's an unwelcome and very unnatural little feature that sort of sterilizes the emotional effect.<br/><br/>It's that and just the way the numerous performers go about their musical numbers, in a heavily bombastic way, that lessen this film as an entire product. I mentioned before that Lea Salonga's rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" worked largely in part to the fact that she didn't seem to be trying to garner any sort of recognition, and just did it straight from the soul and left it at that. Hathaway, while presenting her impeccable voice here, with her tears, sadness, and overwhelming misery appears to be trying to get herself an award. Almost everyone in the cast does, including Jackman who plays Valjean well, until his voice must break into song, then he becomes just average. It's pretty damn apparent to anyone with an artistic eye that the actors in this picture were picked based on the merits of their names and not on their true passion and ability to perform the material as effectively as possible. No one does a bad job, but seeing how so many people with smaller names effectively energized the material at hand, one would figure that the bigger names aren't necessarily needed and the name Les Misérables is big enough to which it could sell itself.<br/><br/>Yet there are perks here great enough to warrant a recommendation of some sorts. While bombastic and anything but subtle, the musical score is performed efficiently here, the gray backdrops are enough to have the audience suffering in their own misery, and the performances are effective around the clock, including Sacha Baron Cohen, who I fear will go under the radar in yet another spectacular supporting role, on par with the quirky one her gave in Martin Scorsese's Hugo he gave around this time last year.<br/><br/>There are several film versions of Les Misérables, none of which I have seen. Hooper's version and the 25th anniversary concert are enough to get me through the next few years, as my thirst has been satisfyingly quenched. Here's a picture that likely because of its cast, crew, name, source material, and period will be a success among audiences and the Academy. As far as an emotional experience goes, I can't say much was done for me in that regard. I'm still backlogged tears after seeing Life of Pi a month ago.<br/><br/>Starring: Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by: Tom Hooper."

","LES MISERABLES (2012) *** Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron Tveit, Samantha Barks, Daniel Huttlestone, Colm Wilkinson, Michael Jibson, Isabelle Allen, Natalya Angel Wallace. Epic overtaking of the adaptation of the smash Broadway musical based on the classic novel by Victor Hugo, the timeless tale of Job-like protagonist Jean Valjean (Jackman nailing it) whose crime of stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's child leads to a chronic manhunt of the parolee by ever-so-determined French policeman Javert (Crowe). Added to the mix is consumptive courtesan Fantine (Hathaway in a harrowing, heartfelt Oscar-worthy turn) whose attempts to support her sole child Cossette (Allen as a child and Seyfried as the mature version) is her sealed fate. Boasting a sprawling cast of extras, impressive production design, and Cameron Mackintosh's smart production overall the film bursts alive in every aspect by busting into song throughout (yes like EVITA but with better results) where the dialogue is also practically sung. While the pacing is a tad off, filmmaker Tom Hooper excels in capturing the emotion and even if Jackman's tenuous tenor trembles on the verge of losing his composure it is a crowd-pleasing success."
"rosiebeast","9","2","5","29 December 2012"," Brilliant movie, overall good casting, and be prepared to be emotionally wrecked.
","I saw the theater production of Les Miserables last December and fell in love with it, so I went into this movie with perhaps unreasonably high expectations. But, I was blown away by this movie; it was absolutely beautiful. The entire film was one emotion after the next; whether it was grief from Anne Hathaway's ""I Dreamed A Dream"" to the heartbreaking ""On My Own"", to the much-needed comic relief of ""Master of the House"". The only reason this film does not deserve a 10 is because I could absolutely not stand Russel Crowe as Javier. I've heard a lot of people criticize his voice, but for me it was more his face, he had hardly any facial expression! Perhaps it was just his portrayal of the character, but he could have done more. Everyone else was fantastic, and I left the movie feeling satisfied and heart broken."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","5","28 December 2012"," Incredible
","Les Miserables had been my most anticipated for several weeks now. I've never seen the stage musical, but I did read the novel because of the film's hype. I also barely see any musicals, and the amount that I have seen in my life could probably be counted in less than two hands. I will try to put out all my thoughts on this, so please bare with me.<br/><br/>I've heard countless of endless criticisms of two particular aspects. The first of them is Tom Hooper, and how uninspired his directing was, how sloppy, how dull, and how plain bad it is. The reason being because of the close-ups, of him allowing the camera to be way into the actors' faces, not allowing the material to breathe. I did expect it to be a little annoying, but I am honestly surprised at all of the exaggeration. The only real time it felt awkward was Valjean's Soliloquy. After that, it either worked very well or there really were no extreme close ups. Examples of some songs being unedited is Fantine's I Dreamed a Dream and Eponine's On My Own, both of which stay in the characters' faces. But the camera is never stationary besides very few scenes, and both scenes work extremely well. Aside from that, all of the countless criticisms of the camera not showing anything else besides close-ups is so not warranted. If anything, I think Tom Hooper makes the film work well, and he actually has more control of this than The King's Speech.<br/><br/>The other point of criticism is one of the cast members, Russell Crowe. The biggest criticism is that he has a horrible voice. Again, I don't see many musicals, but I thought Crowe had one of the most satisfying voices of the cast. It worked extremely well with his character, and that's because Crowe plays Javert with such a stoic approach, but it makes Javert all that more menacing and sympathetic throughout the film's story. Completely fascinating and engrossing performance from Crowe, and probably the MVP of the film. I wouldn't have expected that at all. The biggest reason I bought into the hype for this film was because of Anne Hathaway. I admit, I have seen the teaser trailer and clips of her in the film countless of times, and perhaps that's why I was a bit underwhelmed? Don't get me wrong, Hathaway is great, but also gives the most calculated performance of the film. It's all rather, I don't know, obvious? Still, I feel completely wrong for even pointing out anything because as a whole, she's a success if anything. On the other hand, Samantha Barks gives a performance in a different vein to the rest of the cast members. There's a true sense of despair in her that doesn't feel rehearsed, a true sense of wonder and longing that she conveys in spirit with just one look. In a way you can tell she's not an experienced film actor but I think she helps her character's limited screen time very much, and as a whole is one of the most memorable and sympathetic characters. Redmayne and Tveit both have amazing voices, and both do their characters complete justice. Redmayne is completely heart- breaking and his solo one of the most powerful in the film. Cohen and Carter bring in a lot of much needed lightness to the picture, and I think their characters remain much needed in the span of it all. Hugh Jackman is also a force to be reckoned with, carrying the picture brilliantly and never missing a note in his acting, even when his singing occasionally falters.<br/><br/>The criticisms of Crowe and Hooper aren't just incredibly bewildering to me after having seen it, but so are the countless of critical reviews. This has its fair share of detractors, with many of the criticisms calling it just completely bombastic and unshamelessly and endlessly sentimental, to the point that it pleads for emotion from the audiences. I had read the novel and knew the story and so I expected that, but while it's moving, it never feels as overbearing as many critics said. <br/><br/>Overall, I already feel like I want to rewatch this, but it's definitely satisfying and one of the best films of the year, if not the best. At the same time however, there was so much hype and endless anticipation on my part that it feels like I won't be able to fairly grade it until a rewatch. Perhaps that's why I seemed to feel somewhat different to what nearly all were saying about the film, expecting exactly that what I had heard (for example, Hooper's direction and Hathaway's extraordinary performance). I somehow loved this a lot, but at the same time am fairly cautious on what I want to say about it as a whole. But it worked, incredibly engrossing film and a true movie experience."
"Bruce722","10","2","5","28 December 2012"," Best musical I've ever seen!
","Anyone actually telling you that this movie isn't amazing, just ignore them. Some people don't care for musicals so I understand them not enjoying this film but people actually trying to break down reasons for why this movie wasn't great are just morons. Les Misérables is probably the most intense and dramatic musical I've ever seen. The acting, especially at the top with Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe was Oscar worthy. I haven't seen an entire theater cry that much in my life. Sure, Titanic made just about every cry but that was one scene at the very end. There were probably 5 or 6 scenes throughout Les Mis that were so moving, there were sniffles all around. The singing was also very impressive. Jackman is an all-around star and this movie proves that much. I was also really impressed with Crowe and Hathaway. They're not as polished as Jackman but their voices, and how they acted out their roles, fit perfectly. The only actor who came up short was Amanda Seyfried but even she did a commendable job and the character of Cosette wasn't featured as much as the others. I thought the cinematography, the part of the movie the haters are trying to attack because they can't attack any other element, was also perfectly fine. Overall, this was one of the three best movies I saw all year and, personally, I think Anne Hathaway deserves an Academy Award for Best Actress because she was fantastic. I understand not everyone appreciates musically driven films but if you do, this movie is definitely worth spending the movie to see in theaters."
"jakelawvideo","9","2","5","28 December 2012"," The Best Rendition of Les Miserables EVER
","The story was the best rendition of Les mis I have EVER seen, the acting was perfect and they portrayed their emotions with the maximum ability! Different scenes were added to make it better. And though I though they helped the understanding of what was going on, they almost sort of took away from the movie because it was something I had never seen before, and I was singing along! The actors and screenplay helped my mom, who had never seen Les Mis, actually understand the story, unlike other productions where the scenes are not quite as precise. Their recording technics were innovative and allowed for actor movement and emotion, and while I liked the idea, sometimes the actors used that freedom too much and stole the melody from the song, this is a MUSICAL and they need to treat it like a musical, you don't break out in song in real life! If we did, that's what it would sound like, and that is not what I went to watch! Now, onto my most exhilarated topic..... The actors voices......ugh, where do I start. The girl that played Cosette needed severe help, she did not hit 10% of her higher notes and because they recorded it live, you could see the strains in her neck. The guy that played Marius was excellent, but he obviously can't sing with dry lips. That was a bit disgusting and the fact that he can't sing with vibrato without moving His jaw. He had a few troubles hitting the high notes himself, here and there. His emotion in ""Empty Chairs and Empty Tables"" was the best I have ever seen, and maybe it was the emotional attachment I have to that song, and although I thought the orchestration need some tuning, It was phenomenal, Eddie understood what his character was feeling and put it out in front of him perfectly. But, where was that perfection in the rest of the movie?!?!?! I felt like a few of the actors were perfect during their songs but then during the down parts, lost their energy and passion. OK, the girl that played eponine, great job at following what the director wanted, completely different then when she did it for the 25th anniversary. She was just great. Now...... Jean Val Jean...... The actor chosen was perfect....for his ACTING his voice need serious reconsideration. He lacked control over dynamics and frankly, couldn't sing quite at all. He required power to even sound OK. Which was not acceptable during quite parts. That just made me a tad angry, but he more then made up for it with his acting. The actor who played Javert......was good but, he too, couldn't hit high notes worth anything. His acting was good because he portrayed a lifeless stone cold person. That was FANTASTIC.<br/><br/>OK, enough ranting, all in all, this was the best Les Mis performance I have EVER seen, but I though it could have been even better vocally. But maybe I am just used to the perfection of Broadway and the 25th anniversary edition that was awesome too......well!, I'm off to buy the soundtrack to see if they sound better there or not! Farewell!"
"apurvakanneganti","10","2","5","28 December 2012"," One of the BEST movies I have ever seen
","Although I had never seen the musical before, I spent two months reading the novel. Although it was fluffed with so much unnecessary info, the basic plot was outstanding! I think the musical pared down the unnecessary bits to perfection, leaving only the important things in. <br/><br/>Enough about this, let's get to the movie. Regardless of what others say, I believe the actors were very well cast. Hugh Jackman was amazing, especially in his death scene. Russell Crowe's Javert suffered slightly from the fact that his motive was not shown as clearly as it was in the novel. Eddie Redmayne's Marius was outstanding (the man can SING) and Samantha Barks' Eponine was a tear-jerker through out. Here we come to another problem. Aaron Tveit's tragically heroic Enjolras made me cry. Although Amanda Seyfried portrayed Cosette very well, the script and story fails her and Eponine. Modern women will identify more with Eponine's hidden and impossible love than with angelic Cosette, who seemly has nothing to do but sit pretty, cry for her father, and fantasize about Marius. <br/><br/>All in all, Les Miserables is a grandiose epic that is a must-see for any arts lover. I know I'm going a second and maybe third time."
"italo505","8","2","5","27 December 2012"," Best Picture of the Year? Perhaphs...
","Upon hearing the first verses from Anne Hathaway's ""I Dream a Dream"" with the a cappella quality achieved for this version of Les Misérables, upon seeing how her character Fantine struggles to make ends meet for her only daughter that she is so desperately trying to support is like seeing a wounded soul dying in despair. There's nothing you can do but to witness how the light escapes her eyes, how her voice breaks and how tears begin to stroll down her face after she's lost her pride, her reputation and her will to live. The scene alone is Anne Hathaway's ticket to her much deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, no question about it.<br/><br/>It's hard to predict whether a stage production can make a successful transition to film. Sometimes it pays off very well like with Chicago and Jesus Christ Superstar, sometimes it doesn't (ahem, no comment from this peanut gallery) but none have taken the time that director Tom Hooper did by recording the actor's voices live to later add the musical orchestration in post production which makes all the difference in the world. There's a more personable and intimate quality to approaching the musical this way that gives more meaning to the lyrics spoken. And making Les Mis a sure contender for Best Picture of the Year."
"jjlongstreet-civilwarreb","9","2","5","27 December 2012"," A story of hope, rebellion, pain, love, death, and redemption.
","I love Les Misérables. I'm a huge fan of the musical, and I re-read the book (which I recommend to all of you) just before seeing the movie. And this film was a phenomenal adaptation, a worthy addition to the Les Mis legacy. The subtle nods to Victor Hugo's novel were well done and a fantastic tribute. <br/><br/>The decision to sing live was excellent--there was a raw purity in the performances that could only come from live singing. Isabelle Allen is a surprisingly strong singer and a sweet Cosette. Anne Hathaway's I Dreamed A Dream was beautiful, and each of the actors shone in their roles. My one critique is Russell Crowe--while he has a great voice and presence, Javert needs more fire, more anger, more passion. Crowe's quiet interpretation, especially during Stars, decreased the believability of his character. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was wonderful in every song but one. Bring Him Home is always a jewel in the musical, and it has never failed to impress me--until now. Jackman's rendition was too forced, too loud. Bring Him Home is a prayer, not an argument. The high key of the song is gorgeous, but Jackman's performance did not instill appreciation for it. <br/><br/>I was also a bit disappointed with the many cuts taken from several of the songs. Eponine's death is always very sad, but the multiple cuts from her songs rendered her death less tragic than I expected. The song right after the fall of the barricade and Do You Hear The People Sing also suffered from the cuts. I realize that this is a long film as it is, and something had to be cut, but there were other things that could have been left out more easily. <br/><br/>Which brings me to my final critique. There is something to be said for leaving things to the imagination. While the film did a great job of portraying the horror and the reality of the situation, some of that horror could--and should--have been only implied. The moment just before I Dreamed A Dream is the most obvious of those. It's true--this film is not a happy, fluffy, family-friendly cartoon. The dirt and pain is a reality, but one that doesn't need to be forced upon the audience in that manner. <br/><br/>Reviews always seem to point out the negatives in a piece, rather than the positives. So I want to make it absolutely clear that Les Misérables was an astounding success. The things I've mentioned above are the tiny flaws I've seen in a job well done. It's a beautiful, wonderful film, and I would recommend it to everyone, fans and newcomers alike."
"dfigueras515","8","2","5","27 December 2012"," Well Worth the Watch!
","Personally, I felt that the movie was fantastic. Anne Hathaway's performance was nothing short of sheer brilliance. ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was a very different interpretation from what was usually done. And I honestly think it worked so much better. Well, maybe not better. But it certainly was a stand-out moment and fit more into the movie.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks was great as well, but that was expected. She's done the part before and her voice is gorgeous.<br/><br/>While Russell Crowe's voice wasn't particularly strong, I felt he gave a great performance because his acting was spot on. Many people tend to complain about his acting in this film as too stolid and not much there. But I honestly blame the writers for that. He did the best he could with what he had. The show doesn't really give us much in terms of Javert. He's the stolid and righteous villain doing what he believes to be right. In that respect, Crowe gave a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>As for the vocals not being up to par, I could care less. If you ask me, the piece was directed wonderfully and really gave it a gritty feeling that it should have. The stage show is a different entity completely. I don't feel like they should or COULD be compared at all. On stage, suspension of disbelief allows us to put aside the fact that the performers are trained singers that are singing their hearts out. In film, it's too intimate for that. That's not what Tom Hooper seemed to be going for. He seemed to be going for the grit. In the setting, gorgeous singing would be out of place. He made the show about the story and the acting. It gave it another level to play. So, if you don't go looking for beautiful singing, this really is an amazing movie (Hugh Jackman's ""Bring Him Home"" aside because...let's be honest, that was just awful on all levels.) <br/><br/>Overall, I felt it was an amazing film. Sure, the vocals left more to be desired at points, but this adaption wasn't about the vocals. I really encourage everyone to NOT read reviews before they see the film because it may give them an opinion that they find themselves agreeing with before they even see the film to make their own opinion. I really feel that viewers should make their own opinions of the film.<br/><br/>Of allthe films that are out right now, this is the one to see."
"rivertam26","6","2","5","26 December 2012"," Little bit of a disappointment
","I would first like to say that I've never been a huge fan of the musical Les Miserables. I saw it on Broadway when I was much younger and fell asleep and did enjoy the non musical version unlike so many others. Now watching the story unfold I can appreciate it's scope and complexity but I can't help but feel it's all a little dull, sorry. And I think that mainly has to do with the way its been executed this time around. After a brilliant first 35 mins reaching its peak when Anne Hathaway delivers a heart stopping, tear inducing performance of I dreamed a dream the film begins to flat line. Each scene less effective than the last. And the performances seem to follow suit. Hugh Jackman who blows you away in the beginning starts to come off too intense and forced, Russell Crowe although not terrible seems ill suited for the role and speaking of terrible Amanda Seyfred is just that she's so shrill sounding and has the emotional range of a stunted deer in headlights. Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also show up and deliver the films ghastliest performances with not an wink of charm. And as a pretty much a first timer of the material I can say most of it is pretty mean and dreary. Which is not a bad thing if it had been delivered with the panache that the film started with this could have truly been an amazing experience. Something raw, original and ground breaking. Instead we are left with halted promises as the we get further from the films powerful opening numbers after a while it all feels drab, lethargic and a little rushed at the same time. But I don't wanna be too mean to the film it has a lot of great moments and some truly wonderful songs that are performed exquisitely and it's no doubt that these actors have shown up with their game faces on too bad the proper direction wasn't their to assist them in making something truly special instead of another missed opportunity. ***/5"

I really have never understood what people thought was so great about this story or its music and this movie really brought that home for me. The whole thing was predictable and really kind of stupid. The music was repetitive and anti-melodic . The only good characters were the innkeeper and his wife because at least they were well drawn out and their song made sense. None of the singing was that great, but I expected that but the music made the bad singing even worse.

","Basic info about who I am when pressing play on this fiasco: I knew nothing of LM beyond that it was a book and a very popular stage musical. I knew not of the plot, characters or even basic premise, I have never seen a stage production of anything.<br/><br/>So when I watched this, I judged it like I would any movie and with an open mind.<br/><br/>Massive disappointment from the get-go, the dry dock scene made me think of eye-candy and forget about the characters I was introduced there. Who the bad guy and who good guy was became immediately apparent with the flagpole thing. I instantly knew that something wasn't being told when I found out Jean had been imprisoned for 19 years instead of his original 5-year sentence due to numerous escape attempts.<br/><br/>Skip to Anne's character (I had problems with remembering the names of so many characters), who had become destitute and near-suicidal before I even realized that we weren't on Jean anymore, at which point he pops up in a top hat and a new name (Oh right, silver!) and saves hear from the prison warden who is now a sheriff or something (Isn't police and prison guard entirely different careers?).<br/><br/>I honestly missed these texts that informed me of these time-jumps.<br/><br/>Anne dies and Jean promises to take care of her child, fair enough, it's a very Jean-thing to do. So he frees Cosette from this whorehouse (which is something that seems just glossed over, a little girl rescued from a brothel, seems like we missed the impact that concept should have), it's very cute.<br/><br/>At this point I'm kind of zoning in and out since following the story takes a massive mental effort with what I by now have realized is an entirely sung dialog and just a weirdly adapted plot line, so when Marius and his better half (that charismatic, adult leader that insists on having Marius beside him for no apparent reason), show up I'm already struggling to figure out what they are doing in the story and if I've missed something besides basic french history.<br/><br/>Marius and Colette fall in love at first glance and I lose a lot of interest in both characters, oh and it's been another time-jump (don't know how I missed those texts, honestly) so Cosette is now a lot older while Jean (who should be closing in on at least 50 'by now) remains the same 35-year-old-looking Jackman. What happened during this missed time is even more unclear than the last time.<br/><br/>From there to the barricade parts, the screen is dominated by Marius the bobble-head's face shaking in HD close-up about his immature and undying love for Cosette, but I can't be sure since I don't have the energy left in me to pay attention to a puppy-love affair between two uninteresting people.<br/><br/>The revolution is the best part of the movie, that said, it loses the vast majority of it's potential dramatic effect to the incessant, pointless singing. <br/><br/>Personal Peeves: 1. The girl who had a crush on Marius (I don't know why, he has no personality beyond loving Cosette), goes out of her way to take a bullet for Marius that didn't need to be taken. 2. Oliver Twist stepped into the line of fire for no good reason. 3. Cosette has no personality beyond loving Marius. Vice versa for Marius. 4. Sheriff Crowe's suicide. Why did this happen, again? 5. Jean's play at being a martyr at the end. Seemed mighty unnecessary.<br/><br/>Severe problems with the movie itself (Or why it sucked): 1. The singing. Oh by the nine divines the singing, it wouldn't stop! I didn't realize there were separate sings until I read other reviews about them. Since everything was a friggin' song, it lessened the impact of the actual songs, obviously. Quality over quantity, buddy. The singing wasn't great, but I couldn't really find it in my heart to care about the voices when so much more things were wrong. 2. Close-ups. Been said before but deserves to be said again, you adapted a musical to a movie, make use of these new resources to create a whole world, not limit yourself to exploring the pores of Marius Bobblehead. 3. Romance. Don't get me wrong, romance is just fine, but I'm an adult and I find it easier to relate to adults, there is nothing adult about Marius and Cosette. The whole thing just seems like a pre-teen girl's idea of love. That was all those characters were there for, too. But most of all, it took way too much screen time.<br/><br/>I would probably be kinder if this movie hadn't gotten so many positive reviews and so much praise. This isn't a matter of taste, this isn't a good movie, it is of poor quality."

And yet, spoiled by the continuous ( I mean really unstoppable singing) They could have made a musical (even though I really dislike musicals), containing some songs , but not this. Every line was sung!!!! Every line!!! I could not even watch anymore. I tried to stay, to make my ticket money count, but I could not anymore. All the actors were singing, watching the camera face to face. Everything was so terrible. Except the costumes. I would not suggest this movie to anyone. I can't probably understand HOW this thing made it to the top movies."
"marouski","Null","2","6","2 February 2013"," The best movie I've ever seen so far!
","I literally have no words to express the excellence of the film. It's such a remarkable adaptation of the musical, not to mention even better than the play itself! <br/><br/>First of all, I think this film is a proof that actors can still perform their roles and sing too, like the old good ones could back in the old times. I never expected Jackman and Crowe to sing as well as they can act, it was something entirely surprising that needs to be applauded (and of course rewarded with a handful of awards!) Not to mention Anne Hathaway, who left me crying for 10 minutes or so, like a baby, while singing ""I Dreamed A Dream"". The whole scene with Fantine singing and crying deserves an Oscar and much more than that. Samantha Barks as Eponine...no words. She's absolute perfection. (Yes, the part of ""On My Own"" gave me so many feelings and admiration for Sam.) I also have to give a big bravo and congratulations to the little boy, Daniel Huttlestone, who played Gavroche, my favorite character. (His screen time should be longer actually.) He did more than an excellent job, both to the singing moments and acting, and brought to life the street urchin I always loved from the book. That was exactly how I imagined Gavroche's character to be honest.(According to some sources, this is his first role in a movie and that should be noted. I hope he gets lots of awards for his performance.) In his death scene, he left me speechless (and sobbing) too. Generally, all the actors were plain perfect at everything!<br/><br/>Also, the songs, the costumes and the set were just...amazing, perfect and awesome! The set made me believe I was actually in 19th century's Paris. The barricades and the actors waving the liberty flags of the French astounded me, because it was like seeing these old paintings coming to life, the ones with scenes from the French Revolution, and that was really great. <br/><br/>All in all, I gave it a 10/10 because it was entirely amazing and beautiful. Like I said, no words can express the perfection of this film. I didn't expect to see such a beautiful film at times like these. It is worth watching and I definitely recommend it to everyone."
"s_campanale","5","2","6","28 January 2013"," The Grand made Small - Unlike the Book or the Opera, this is NO Epic!
","This review presupposes knowledge of the book and the musical. If you don't know the story at all, then there are big spoilers below!<br/><br/>150 years ago Victor Hugo wrote a huge novel that was grand in scope and powerful in its emotions, moving readers as few books had before.25 years ago a new form of ""modern opera"" was created, birthing a blockbuster show that was grand and emotionally powerful, which sent audiences the world over home in tears.<br/><br/>Now Tom Hooper has taken them both and made them small, weak and mediocre. The characters have the same names and the storyline is the same, but there is no heart, no soul, nothing to care about.<br/><br/>I managed to read the whole book (eventually!) and soon after went to see the London production of ""Les Mis"" in 1997, which overwhelmed me so much I had to be taken by my wife to see ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" midnight show at the ODEON Leicester Square to recover! When I saw the trailers and the hype preceding this movie adaptation, I was expecting something grand and epic, both physically (the story could be really opened out on film the way a stage show couldn't) musically (the score done in dolby digital multiple surround) and emotionally. Instead what we saw was a bland BBC production in which 85% of the movie is done in tight close ups of people literally just pacing around or sitting down! This was clearly either to hide the miniscule sets, which seem even more limited than the stage versions, or a botched attempt to do what cannot be done on stage, get literally ""in their faces"". Either way, it doesn't work. Also many of the numbers are seriously truncated, and events speeded up. True, this is necessary for film, but again it was badly botched, killing tension, character development and pathos as well as rhythm. The book/opera's many moments of emotional power are treated in such a glib and offhand manner that they become just trivial details. Jean Valjean's conversion to good, Fantine's fall from grace, young Cosette's pain, all get a light brushing over. They even managed to destroy Eponine's death, one of the most crushing and suffocating moments in musical theatre, which is unforgivable. Indeed, Eponine herself gets a noticeably short shrift in this production, (even her ghost is notably absent in the final scene) perhaps because Samantha Barks who beautifully plays her is showing up the other headline players, notably Amanda Seyfried, who is as bland and anodyne here as elsewhere, and so has to be shoved aside! Her parent's Mr and Mrs Thernandier are turned from the wicked scum of the book/musical into literal cartoon characters, and in their final scene at Marius' wedding they leave almost as heroes the audience is meant to be siding with. Where is the well-deserved vicious moral lashing they receive in the stage version? Shoved aside too so we can love those wacky bastards some more! The ""empty chairs empty tables"" song was done literally, with Marius sitting alone in a room with empty chairs and tables! Where are the stirring memories of his fallen comrades that we see in the book and the stage show surrounding him? It's in the text alone because we sure as Hell never see them.<br/><br/>It's hard to rate the performances since most of the cast are there for star power rather than singing power, even though most have some sort of musical background. No one is tuneless, but there is no energy, no drive, and no drama in their performances. Only Anne Hathaway manages to inject some little life into her character, but frankly you'd have to be really bad if you couldn't wring any pathos out of Fantine so it isn't saying much. In a work that functions entirely on drama and emotion, the lack of it is going to kill a production stone dead.<br/><br/>As I said before, I cried reading the book, and I cried at the show. Here I felt nothing, nothing at all. Many have written here saying likewise. Take from that what you will."
"mwriter-2","10","2","6","26 January 2013"," ** When Epic is Appropriate **
","The story is of course great, but clearly a challenge to reduce to a film, yet I found this to be honestly epic. I do not feel you had to read the book to understand or follow the story and the visuals carried us through the story delightfully. I felt many emotions and cried too, but I found great joy from having seen this movie. Without slight to the other cast members, this is Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe's movie. And unlike some who did not find Mr. Crowe to be great, I felt he delivered for me a wondrous character. That said, I feel this is the performance that will elevate Mr. Jackman to the halls of truly great actors. For me this was great experience and worth seeing again and again."
"meeza","6","2","6","13 January 2013"," I dreamed a dream that this movie was better
","I really don't have problems with movie musicals. It is not my favorite film genre, but I do respect the musical. However, a little dialogue would be nice from time to time incorporated with the singing. There was very, very little of that in Director Tom Hooper's film adaptation of ""Les Miserables"". So therefore, that was one main reason why I felt miserable numerous times in experiencing ""Les Miserables"". As most of you are aware, the movie is adapted from Victor Hugo's infamous novel and Broadway show. It is set in 19th Century France and tells the story of Jean Valjean, a former thief who for decades was hunted down by ruthless policeman Javert after he breaks parole. Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter Cosette. When Cosette grows older, she falls for revolutionist Marius who is set in standing strong against the tyranny of France. I wonder if Marius bought Cosette a corset and if they french kissed on the night of their prom. OK, those were some miserable puns! ""Les Miserables"" seemed like it lasted an entire day. Hooper does a decent job in reconstructing the look of the time and also the technical efforts in the movie were solid. But Hooper's direction was not powerful enough to persuade viewers who are not fan of the musical to buy in to ""Les Miserables"". If one is a Miserables fan, no doubt you will adore this movie. I can't really comment too much on the movie's screenplay because it was pretty much nonexistent since most of the screen played to characters singing away their melancholy. Undoubtedly, Hugh Jackman is a renaissance man and it showed once more in his performance as Valjean; however, I do not call it Oscar-worthy; Hugh know what I mean? Many people seemed to be scarecrowed of Russell Crowe's singing in his work as Javert; but it's actually not that bad. Anne Hathaway is sure to pick up a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the doomed Fantine for her emotional performance. I loved her work, but I was mostly watching a buzzcut Hathaway on screen and not a total transformation into the Fantine character; hey, that is just my buzz. ""Les Miserables"" includes other decent (though not spectacular) tenor performances from Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Samantha Barks as Eponine, and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. I could have done without the ridiculous performances from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as Thenardier and Madame Thenardier. ""Les Miserables"" is not the most miserable movie-going experience I have ever had; but if you are an avid fan of the infamous musical, you should not miz out in checking out Hooper's ""Les Miserables"". *** Average"
"secretsinger1998","10","2","6","5 January 2013"," unbelievable and outstanding!!
","I have seen a lot of musicals, and I have always had a love for them. but this one by far is the most emotional, outstanding musical yet!!! The story line is intense and very sad without even giving it much thought... Fantine ends up having to shave all her hair off and pulls teeth to pay for her daughter to stay alive. her daughter Cosette, is a slave for ThÃ©nardier and Madame ThÃ©nardier and dreams of a better life. then there is the romance problem with Ã‰ponine being in love deeply with Marius when he is in love with Cosette. Then the intense and at times hart warming conflict between Jean Valjean and Javert.. this movie is going to Absolutely hit some type of emotion in your heart. but don't worry you'll have some time to laugh at the con artist ThÃ©nardier and Madame ThÃ©nardier. They brought just the right amount of humor to the movie without making it too silly.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is amazing! the journey he takes is so inspiring and unforgettable it really makes you think twice about the chose you make in your life. Jean Valjean should be a role model to people of all ages; he started off in the dirt where he lost everything till someone taught him to love and show compassion to others, then he ends up living to help others and show mercy and compassion when they need him the most.<br/><br/>The amount of emotion that is put into the music is unforgettable! when you are listening to them sing in pain or happiness you can truly believe that they are feeling the emotion that they are suppose to be feeling. My heart dropped when Ann Hathaway started singing ""I dreamed a dream"" I felt so emotional and I felt so much empathy for her. Then when Javert was singing right before he commits suicide, you could see the ace of his pain and vengeance. These actors are MARVOLIS!!!! OUTSTANDING!! I cant emphasize on how great the acting was.<br/><br/>I was worried my friend who went with me was going to hate it for the fact that they hardly talk at all in the movie, cause its all singing.. but my friend to my great surprise actually liked it better than them talking. They make it really seem normal and natural to just be singing. I deeply admire that they sang live on set as well, that hasn't been done before and you could tell the difference! all musicals should just be live summary: This is an amazing movie! with amazing actors, script, music, effects, and singing. everything is so believable, I think that's why the movie is so tear jerking. seriously make this movie a must see in theaters, and BUY the DVD when it comes out."
"cultrara-163-986457","6","2","6","1 January 2013"," Movie vs. the stage version
","If you have never seen Les Mis you probably would have loved it. If you saw it on stage you would have noticed some changes which went against the stage version. Javier had more of a belting bravado voice as compared to Russel Crowe. Javier putting the medal on Garosche was totally out of character. Also the songs ran too together at times. It would jump from one song right to another. On stage there could be a continuity where it didn't jump all over. You were looking at once scene not bouncing from one person or place to another. But if you saw Les Mis with Colm Wilkinson as Valjean on stage the movie would in a sense ring hollow. I was very disappointed by Jackman. He butchered ""Bring Him Home."" He definitely does not have the ability to pull the role off like Colm. Having seen Colm play the role in Toronto twice was an honor. Putting him in the movie just reminded the audience of who the real master of the house was. It is worth seeing but if you had a chance to see it on stage you would enjoy it even more that more than the movie."
"bcook254","6","2","6","26 December 2012"," The 2nd half saved this movie.
","Les MisÃ©rables, at first seems to leave a lot to be desired. I was almost completely lost and had no clue what was happening during the first half. Also, the shots taken were all at awkward angles, and everything felt very cramped. There wasn't space for the characters in the shots.<br/><br/>Maybe this was just the theater I was in (but I really don't think it was), but the sound felt very empty. Hugh Jackman's singing left much to be desired and parts of the song were completely ruined. I know kids in high school that are more talented than him, in their drama programs. Anne Hathaway did surprise me a little and didn't do very bad at playing her character while she was alive.<br/><br/>Later in the film was when I actually started to enjoy the movie. When Russell Crowe started having more songs, I thoroughly enjoyed them and was pleased to hear how good he was. Also Samantha Barks was an excellent choice for Ã‰ponine and consistently had a clear and wonderful voice. Her acting and singing fit the part exactly.<br/><br/>The scenes and singing of the second half were much improved over the first except for Eddie Redmayne. As a vocal student listening to him and Hugh Jackman sing made me cringe every time. Eddie Redmayne singing from his throat sent shivers down my spine, and Hugh Jackman just didn't know how to sing.<br/><br/>The only reason this actually got a semi-decent rating was for the second half."

","""Les Miserables"" is the most thrilling piece of cinema i have seen all year. Director Tom Hooper, who won an Oscar for the ""The King's Speech"" has succeeded brilliantly in bringing the hit musical to the big screen. The only weak link is Russell Crowe who is a mediocre singer. His acting however makes up for it. Hugh Jackman is a revelation as Jean Valjean. His singing gets better as the picture progresses. As for Anne Hathaway they should cancel the best supporting actress category and just send the Oscar to her already. When ""One Day More"" started the my hair stood on end. I saw the stage version 3 times and wondered how they would pull this off but Hooper makes it dazzling. After the screening people cheered and clapped. The live singing was revolutionary but it worked. This is one the best films of the year and one the best musicals ever made. The finale with the entire cast singing is the most exciting ending you will see in a film this year. The order of the some of the songs have been changed but this is actually an improvement.

The filming was exquisite. The coloring set the tone in every scene.
It is the second most beautiful story of redemption....second to the Cross that is. What makes the story so beautiful is the weaving of the story of the Cross woven in. The Cross lifts men (and women) from shame and sin, washes them and raises us to the new life of purpose and freedom we were meant to live.
Yet the story shows freedom, love, and forgiveness are not cheap. To purpose to give them to others comes at a cost.

","I loved the Uma Thurman version. I am also a fan of the stars of this film. I was just not overjoyed to see them all together. Many of the songs worked magnificently. There was a lot of song dialouge that didn't work as well. I felt this should have been a musical rather than an opera. I was surprised at how well the actors could hold their notes, like a professional, yet not sound as well on simpler tunes. There are also professional singers who can act (not 50 Cent). Personally I would have cast them.<br/><br/>How is it all these Frenchmen have British accents? The music enhances the already rolling coaster ride of emotion of the saga, making the highs higher and lows lower. There has been almost a void of decent musicals in the motion picture industry since the 1960's. This one fills the void with a great story and cinematography. You are hooked on the film by a brilliant opening scene with Jackman surprising the bejesus out of me with his singing and Crowe does not.<br/><br/>As a musical, I won't rush out and buy the sound track. Looks good on the big screen. But seriously, 5 stars? Perhaps the most amazing thing is that Russell Crowe, who can't carry a tune in a bucket, got a major starring role in a musical. Don't look for that to happen again.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Brief sex scene."

"lee_eisenberg","9","1","2","5 November 2017"," feel the wretched existence
","Victor Hugo's 1862 novel ""Les MisÃ©rables"" (which means ""the wretched ones"" in English) is one of the most famous French novels of all time. I haven't read the novel, but I've seen the 1998 and 2012 movie adaptations. The 1998 movie, starring Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush, is a direct adaptation of Hugo's novel (and is a good movie). The 2012 movie is based on Alain Boublil's and Claude-Michel SchÃ¶nberg's musical adaptation of the novel. While I've never seen the stage version, I can say that this is a good movie, detailing protagonist Jean Valjean's redemption as the dogged Inspector Javert pursues him over the course of several years.<br/><br/>While I'm not usually into musicals, this one does a fine job connecting Valjean's life to the political turmoil that dominated France in the early 1800s. Indeed, Valjean spent years in jail merely for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's children (showing the hardship that most people in France faced at the time). It was understandable why the revolutionary zeal that brought down Louis and Marie Antoinette stayed alive for decades afterwards.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call the movie a masterpiece, but I think that they accomplished something with it. Very well done. It stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and Eddie Redmayne. Put another way, it stars Wolverine, Gladiator, Catwoman, Linda Lovelace, Borat, Bellatrix LeStrange and Stephen Hawking."
"iNickR","8","1","2","30 October 2017"," A Butt-Numbing Epic In A Good Way
","Bare with me a moment. When I think Les MisÃ©rables, the first thing that comes to mind is not the classic epic 1862 novel by the great French writer Victor Hugo. Unfortunately, for me, I think of the ""1% Club"" in expensive suits and gowns out for an evening at the theatre watching moderately-paid stage actors with unconvincing accents perform a classic epic novel exclusively FOR the enjoyment of the ""1% Club"". I mean, really, who in their right 99% mind would go to a stage show that takes place in the early 1800's OTHER than people with more dollars than sense? Let me clarify something, certainly past (and perhaps even present) stage productions of Les MisÃ©rables were probably not specifically geared toward the snobs of the world. In fact, the contrary may be true! Perhaps the novel was Mr. Hugo's way of ""sticking to the man"", 19th century style (he was a 60-year-old former royalist-turned-republican when he wrote ""Les Mis"" and later became a member of the French Senate)! But I digress.<br/><br/>The ""1% Club"" comes to my mindÂ…or I should say CAME to mind whenever I heard about Les MisÃ©rables because, I'm willing to admit now, it was my ignorance of certain things I don't care about (I am a narcissistic idiot savant after all). I never read the book and I had no desire to. The stupid thing is over 1,400 pages! (1,900 in the original French version!) The KJV of the Bible only has 1,200 pages and it took me 40 years to get through that (and I'm still an ignorant blasphemer at times)! I did try to read Les MisÃ©rables about 7 years ago but my mental health issues would not allow me to get past chapter 5.<br/><br/>Over the years I gathered from various sources what Les MisÃ©rables what all about: an ex-con named Jean Valjean (that's fun to say, isn't it?) trying to redeem himself but can't seem to escape his criminal past (which, by today's standards of good and evil isn't so bad â€“ he stole food for his sister's children!). Sure, sounds like a page-turner, I know, but I had better things to do. So, instead, I just deduced that the story was atypical of society today: a depressing struggle to live (am I far off?) and chose to pretend I was well-read and erudite when trying to fit in with the ""1% Club"". Les MisÃ©rables, the novel, is so much more than that (I repeat, am I far off?). If you have the time, and apparently no life, I encourage you to read it. I, however, took the easy way out and watched the movie â€“ and it still took me until five years AFTER its release to see it (thank you Public Library!).<br/><br/>This version of Les MisÃ©rables comes in at a butt-numbing 158 minutes. Unlike the theatre, or some of those epic films of the 1950's, there is no intermission which could allow time to use the washroom or check your Facebook (but there is a pause button thankfully). For someone with a short attention span like me, I didn't need to do that. There's enough action and violence to keep your butt in the seat, guys, and to be old fashioned in a non- misogynistic kind of way, for the women there's romance and familial bonds and love to keep you reaching for the tissues (even I enjoyed that part, too).<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of books-turned-musicals-turned-into-a-movie (I get the urge to sing everything I say), nevertheless this movie was not only enjoyable but also well made from a technical standpoint. Danny Cohen does a great job behind the lens (as is usually the case when he DP's a project). Cohen sometimes works with Production Designer Eve Stewart, and just like two of their past projects together - The King's Speech (2010), The Danish Girl (2015) - you can see that they do make a great tandem that helps bring this epic story to the screen. Skilled Director Tom Hooper unites the enormous cast and crew and even manages to get Russell Crowe to sing (!), all for a budget of less than $61 mil (USD). Not too bad, even a cynical 99%-er could appreciate the value of that."
"laurenknight-58650","9","1","2","12 December 2016"," Faithful Adaptation, great acting.
","I went into this movie unsure of what to expect. As someone who had seen the stage production three times, I was worried that the movie would ruin Les Mis for me and it would not seem right as a film. I was proved to be wrong.<br/><br/>From the first song, I was hooked. The dramatic scenes, costumes, makeup and acting really worked well to set the scene and give an emotional appeal. I found that the film did a great job of giving the story something a stage production couldn't have much of, close ups and setting. I found the setting really added a lot to the film and it was something I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>Now, onto the actors. Starting with Hugh Jackman, I thought he was great for the role of Jean Vajean. The way he looked and acted was very good. However, although his acting was very good, I felt that at times he did not have quite the vocal abilities. An example is during the song, Who Am I. He spoke more than sang and did not hold the notes long enough. However, the emotional delivery of that song was spectacular.<br/><br/>As many said, Anne Hathaway was very fitting. She had a great singing voice and put her heart and soul into the character. Although Russel Crowe was widely criticised for not being a good singer, he really portrayed Javert very well and his singing was not terrible. It did lack power in some areas, but he was good overall.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne gave by far the best delivery of any solo song in the entire movie. he had great facial expressions during the closeups and his singing and delivery was amazing. Amanda Seyfried's singing voice was also beautiful. It was high but not ear piercing and she really portrayed the beautiful and dainty Cosette very well.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed Les Miserables and probably cried about ten times throughout. It is definitely a must see for fans."

Jean Valjean the innocent prisoner , the one who feel the injustice as he was jailed just because he stole a piece of bread to feed his hunger, also an incredible performance from Hugh Jackman.

The songs focus mainly on the drama, but they do get boring, especially for someone who doesn't love musicals, but just wanted to see what all the buzz was about.

"ChristianLeFeuvre","2","1","2","27 October 2015"," Could have been, and should have been, SO much better.
","With being so passionate and hooked on the musical, I was extremely excited, but also slightly concerned, about the movie version...would Russell Crowe hit the long notes, would the emotion come across etc.....well, despite the fact it does do some things well, and some of the cast members are fabulous (Anne Hathaway, Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne), it is pretty dismal when compared to the stage production. That is, if they can even be compared. I have a few niggles but will come to those later, firstly enormous praise has to go to Anne Hathaway for her performance as Fantine. Her rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' is one of the best I have heard, she emotes every word and you really feel and understand every word and what it truly means. Eddie Redmayne was genuinely a superb Marius. I loved his rendition of 'Empty Chairs At Empty Tables' and I did weep like a baby most of the way through it hehehe. Samantha Barks as Eponine was simply AMAZING (having seen her play Eponine on stage and at the 25th anniversary concert it wasn't surprising she would be excellent in the role). The cinematography was excellent and I seriously had to control myself from not bursting into applause after almost every song, although I failed miserably in controlling myself from bursting into tears at almost every moment. However....now we come to the niggles. For such a powerful musical they needed singers who could act, not actors who could sing (or in Russell Crowe's case, actors who 'think' they can sing). Hugh Jackman as Valjean is not bad, but not good either (his 'Bring Him Home' was extremely disappointing). I seriously HATED Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers. The comedy of 'Master Of The House' didn't come across as it should, and there really was no need for his pathetic attempt at a French accent (which came and went). Both of them were very badly miscast. I was also slightly confused by so many lyric changes from the original, bits missing and new ones put in, and rearrangement of where songs came, for example 'On My Own' coming before 'One Day More' instead of after, very odd. The one new song written for the movie titled 'Suddenly', was good but I just felt it was adding a song for adding sake. If they hadn't bothered adding a new song they could have stuck to the original libretto and not cut so much. Russell Crowe surprised as Javert, but not in a good way. His singing was very weak and his rendition of 'Stars' lacked the emotion and despair it should have, such a shame they concentrated on a 'name' instead of real talent. I personally think Tom Hooper, who is a great director, was way out of his comfort zone and turned out a less than average movie version. I was extremely disappointed with so many aspects of the movie. In conclusion, some of the cast are excellent, some dreadful. If you are a massive Les Miserables fan, it is worth seeing, but definitely stick to the stage production and the DVD's of the 10th and 25th Anniversary productions."

","I could leave it at that. Beautiful. However, I will of course add a bit more. I have read the novel that this is based on, and wasn't sure what to expect... would they ""hollywood-ize"" the story just to make it all fit, or to make it work. Of course, it would be VERY difficult to put everything Hugo put into his book into a single film... there were so many explanations, pondering, memories, descriptions, social criticism. However, the things they left out... they picked well. Was it really important to learn about Fantine's past, the love she lost in Paris? They left out the scene of her leaving her child with the innkeepers, but that was OK as well. They changed the plot, having Valjean and the policeman meet during Valjean's imprisonment, while in the book, they didn't meet until Valjean becomes a mayor.<br/><br/>All this doesn't even matter. What matters is - this movie is beautiful. The performances are. Yes, it WILL take time to get used to pretty much everything being sung. It might be tough to adjust to that. I don't even wanna THINK about this being on normal TV, with commercial breaks or anything. This is an amazing performance all the way through. The way it was made, with the actors singing on SET while performing, instead of having to lip sync... very bold, and it works.<br/><br/>I was very touched by many of the performances. I definitely am no fan of Anne Hathaway or Sasha Baron Cohen. Still, I loved what they did. Anne seemed to really FEEL the pain Fantine felt, the desperation, hopelessness, the feeling of being so wronged, her longing for her daughter. Both actors won me over with this. I will never enjoy the movies they are famous for, such as Princess Bride etc, but here, I simply have to admit they did an amazing job, and I was truly impressed.<br/><br/>Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter added some comic relief, but it wasn't unnecessary, doesn't spoil things. It's not ""lets ruin this serious story with some modern and silly humor"". The scenes are a bit bizarre...it almost felt as if the whole bar-scene was co-directed by Tim Burton, and yet it works.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman... I am saddened he didn't get an Academy Award for his performance. He went through a LOT for this, losing so much weight, trying to actually LOOK the part (like in prison or at the very end), his singing was great, his performance so emotional. There were several scenes, not only featuring Jackman, that had me in tears, and I was stunned by how much emotion and power most of the actors put into this. <br/><br/>There are some beautiful scenes and images... the prison-scene and Valjean's trip through the mountains. The barricades. The funeral parade.<br/><br/>Of course, the music is beautiful, all the way through.<br/><br/>This will surely not be for everyone. I did not know what to expect, but I was captivated all the way through, and am very very impressed. Any award they won for this, they deserved."

","When I first saw this film, I was invested. Second time, I was bored. Third time, annoyed. And so on. I can see why people really like this movie. With no strings attached to any other productions, the movie isn't that bad. The characters are interesting, scenes are also shot in interesting ways, and it never lets up story wise. But being a music guy myself and seen better productions of this musical, I just can't see it the same way others do. I respect those who do like this movie, and a lot of people really enjoy it. I'm glad they can see past the close ups, misplaced singing, and brushed over side characters because I can't.<br/><br/>I tell you all of this because I just believe Les Miserables is just directed in a way where it ether just doesn't look good, confusing, or just boring. However, my complaints aren't connected to the acting in the film. For as much as Russell Crow has been criticized by critics for his horrific singing, he's still Russell Crow. He brings a solid performance of honor, determination, and authority. Hugh still gives his best singing and acting wise. And Ann Hathaway gave her role as Fantine her best. If this was shot in a way that was slow or tense or at the very least normal, this could've worked. Sort of what Joe Wright did for Pride and Prejudice , just a solid adaptation of classic with enough standout performances to make it an independent piece art but still keeping it to the source material so that you can say ""they made that"". But that's not what they wanted. They wanted an action adventure with dark deaths, harsh outcomes, and ambiguityÂ… with singing! That's the biggest problem with the movie. It's not sure if it wants to be an independent piece of art or faithful to the original musical. So, after a dramatic sequence where someone important dies, you might get some random slapstick that isn't even funny. It also wants to be a dark comedy along with being a dramatic piece of art. This works, if you're given a world you can fully embarrass. In Pulp Fiction, you laugh at horrific scenes because the protagonists didn't know what was truly going to happen. So it felt like you, a person with morals, could understand how insane these people really are. But in Les Miserables, there is no consistency with the kind of world they're living. It just says, ""There needs to be humor now"" or ""there needs to be drama now"". There is no over arcing tone to it all.<br/><br/>But, I'll say it again; the actors really buy into what is going on. They fully devote themselves to these roles. So, is it good? Well, in my opinion, I believe it's weak. I personally hate weak films because I can't particularly hate them nor can I like them. But it's worth a watch just for the actors or cultural value. But, if you had the choice between this film and Silence of the Lambs, I'd choose Silence of the Lambs."

","As someone who usually strays completely away from musical films, I stepped into the local Las Vegas movie theater on opening day to witness what makes this movie rise on a grand scale from its original stage production. When I did, the songs were incredible and the story was filled with drama, suspense, and humorous moments provided by funny guy Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter (reunited since the 2007 musical Sweeney Todd).<br/><br/>The story about recently-released prisoner Jean Valjean restarting his life anew in 1815 France, only to encounter various people along the way that affects him and those people greatly as years progress. The most notable person he comes across is the virtuous Fantine who tells him to find her daughter Cosette and care for her as her final dying wish. Jean raises her, but things become more complicated as rebels in France begin a revolution causing unrest. At the same time love, trust, and betrayal roll in as well.<br/><br/>With so much to say about 2012's Les Miserables, I find this an exceptional musical. The time and setting usually doesn't sit well with me, but none of it mattered when I kept my eyes and ears open to the cast themselves. Hugh Jackman delivered such a radiant performance as lead character Jean Valjean. Anne Hathaway was superb in belting out her rendition of ""I Dreamed A Dream"" while Russell Crowe's portrayal of Jean's pursuer Javert was done incredibly well with own singing performance. Samantha Barks did splendidly well as Eponine as the love rival to Amanda Seyfried's Cosette for Eddie Redmayne's Marius. But I say that the real show stealers goes to the kids themselves. Daniel Huttlestone had spunk and wittiness as young rebel boy Gavroche and Isabelle Allen's portrayal of young Cosette was pretty spot-on. Her singing displayed innocence and a longing to be loved. These kids really captured my attention!<br/><br/>I can now see why musical films are usually not looked upon widely by some avid filmgoers, but they have no idea what they're missing if they don't catch it. With Anne Hathaway's Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress and the riveting performance of the songs ""Suddenly"" and ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" were quite phenomenal. A nod to the original production of Les Mis is seen in the local church's Bishop (played by Colm Wilkinson) at the beginning of the film, which is a nice touch. I was clearly sold when it all ended. By far, the best of director Tom Hooper's work."

"TheFilmGuy1","5","1","2","4 August 2014"," This Movie Made Me Miserable
","Oh god. Let me start out by saying that I have seen what people seem to say is the best version of the stage production on DVD, but I have not read the original book, so I am essentially speaking about the musical. I personally extremely dislike the story of Les Mis. First off, the book looks like its longer than the bible, so the idea that you can cram all that into a 2 hour and 30 minute movie or a 3 or 4 hour stage musical is crazy. <br/><br/>With both the film and stage version, the plot of Les Mis is all over the place. First its about a man who stole a loaf of bread for his sister and was arrested, but then he is release and he steals some stuff. Forget the sister, cause we gotta cut to 8 years later with no info on anything in between! Now he's a mayor. He feels bad for a woman who he kind of was mean to and now he is taking care of her kid. BOOM MORE YEARS LATER! Suddenly we are focusing on a revolution and the character drama becomes more of a side plot. We also don't get any explanation for the revolution except ""we're poor and we don't like rich people so lets make a wall out of chairs and kill soldiers"", which is not good for people who have little knowledge of the French revolution. The movie seems to have so much to deal with that it just decides to fly around like a drunk bird hoping we get the idea. I'm sorry, but under the assumption that the book is better, the film and stage versions of Les Mis are a complete mess plot wise. <br/><br/>Lets talk about the music, seeing as it is a musical. One issue I have is that although I kind of like musicals, I find it hard to take seriously a musical that is singing about a serious subject matter. It feels odd when you sing about someone dying. Musical like Grease or The Producers allow you to have fun with the songs. This movie uses the music to make you feel...miserable. All of the singing was done live on set, and it shows. While this style of filming greatly benefits the actors ability to give strong acting performances, it can make their singing take a serious hit. I felt that Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks were the only too that let their emotions in their acting also benefit their singing and make both work. Occasionally Hugh Jackman did, but I feel like he sings kind of strange. Russel Crowe is good in certain moments, but can also be fairly monotone, which I understand is kind of the style of singing for that character, but still. In the end it feel that live singing while acting doesn't work for everyone.<br/><br/>A big plus in this film is its costumes and some of the sets. The costumes look very good and even the makeup and hair, except for Eddie Redmayne's character who seems to have some kind of hair gel, which they do because he's supposed to be the heartthrob for young girls (except he looks more like a frog with spikey hair). The sets can sometime feel quite real and well done, but other times feel fake and very set like, or even use too much CGI and feel unreal.<br/><br/>In the end, this film just doesn't work. It feels rushed and is so bloated with plot that it feels like it goes on and on and on. Also, I have never hear so many English accents in France. I understand that this happens in Hollywood films where they take place in Europe, but it really just seems insulting when the film is so heavily about France and the FRENCH people. I wouldn't recommend this film. Go see a fun musical, because you will be quite happy that you did instead of watching this."
"landerkiki","10","1","2","19 July 2014"," Nothing short of great!!
","I loved this as a musical and Tom Hooper did an amazing job bringing the musical to the big screen. I thought all of the performances were also fantastic especially Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried because unlike the others they didn't have any musical theater background whatsoever under the belts. No Mama Mia doesn't count because it was prerecorded and used auto-tune. I doubted Crowe at first and while he wasn't amazing, he did the best he could. He simply did not have the right voice or training to play such a powerful character. Anne obviously blew everyone away. Barks was only as good as she should have been, I mean she played Eponine on stage if she wasn't as good as she was that would have been shameful. Redmayne and Jackman were strong and belted out when needed. Carter and Cohen were amazingly funny and added much needed comic relief. Overall very well done. <br/><br/>Side note: I hate when people say Seyfried didn't deserve the part of she wasn't good enough. <br/><br/>1. If you read the book Seyfried with slightly browner hair IS Cosette. From head to toe, innocent. If she didn't look the part I don't know who would because their likeness is uncanny. <br/><br/>2. People say she has a thin voice and cannot hold her notes. Does anyone else in the movie have such impossibly high notes? <br/><br/>3. Cosette and Eponine were the two most auditioned roles in the whole film and Amanda beat out apparently over 1, 769 other actresses and singers hoping for the role. So get over it!"
"mjbrook","10","1","2","24 February 2014"," Movie Review and argument as to why the film was so successful
","Movie Review of Les Misérables <br/><br/>Les Misérables is a drama-filled and emotion packed film that has received a lot of respect since it was released on the 25th of December, 2012 (Hooper 2012). Originally being a musical on Broadway, Tom Hooper, the director, brought it to the big screen. Hooper followed the story line from the Broadway musical pretty tightly and even kept the live musical style to it. Out of the huge number of actors needed to make this film possible, the main and most well known actors were Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe who played the three main characters of Jean Valjean, Fantine, and Javert (""Les Misérables""). The actors, the live singing, and the set design had a large impact on the success of this film, but what I believe won Les Misérables its 51 awards was its easily relating to story plot featuring a hurting economy, a country in the middle of war, and the struggle of a prisoner trying to get back on his feet.<br/><br/>The setting for this movie was France in the mid-1800s. The majority of the people in France like in the movie were facing rough economic hardships. There was a lot of poverty and crimes committed because of the economic situation. In the movie, Anne Hathaway played a mother who did everything she could to support her daughter. When Fantine (Hathaway) was fired from her job working in the factory, she had to resort to anything that resulted into her receiving some type of income. Fantine sold her hair and even sold herself into prostitution just to be able to provide for her daughter (""Les Misérables""). This scene often reaches out to many parents' emotions because just like Fantine, most would do anything just to provide for their family. Maybe a father has to work a third job or a family has to mortgage their house, and although these sacrifices are not as dramatic or extreme as falling into prostitution, the same emotions are shared from the characters in Les Misérables to the audience. <br/><br/>The Revolution trying to overthrow the French government was also displayed in this movie. Like many of us know, with war comes the sacrifices of many lives for the greater good. When I think of war, I do not just think of fighting and blood, I also think of love. With the Revolution in Les Misérables, a large amount of love is shown between characters and their families. Like in society today, many friends or significant others would take a bullet in order to save the person they love just as Eponine, a friend of Marius, did. With Eponine sacrificing her life for a friend, strong emotions are presented to the audience. War veterans and families of war heroes, are immediately connected and engaged in the movie because they can somehow relate themselves to one of the members of the Revolution. Later in the Revolution, all but one student dies leaving the one surviving with despair and devastation. This feeling of despair and devastation is always seen in families and through veterans when lives are lost. Because Hooper was able to engage and connect his audience with those feelings, he was able to make his movie and the meaning of it so much stronger. <br/><br/>One last component Hooper was able to correlate with his audience in order to make the movie successful was the struggles of a convict trying to get back on his feet. According to Fox43, a little over 60 percent of inmates return to prison within three years of being released. Seeing Jean Valjean's experience, the audience is able to correlate the hardships that recently released inmates experience. Just as Javert kept a close watch on Jean Valjean, many parole officers and citizens keep a close watch on people that have committed crimes in the past no matter what the present looks like. Just like Jean Valjean, inmates on parole experience struggles of turning their life around and are almost forced to commit another crime just to stay alive. Hooper was able incorporate Valjean's past to show the audience that people can indeed change no matter the circumstances. James Bernardinelli of Reelviews.net stated that Hooper ""draws inspiration as much from the source material as from the musical to result in an engaging production that is guaranteed to enthrall audiences""(Berardinelli). With the inspiration of Jean Valjean's attempt to recover his footing, the audience is able to become engaged and can relate.<br/><br/>Les Misérables is viewed by critics as ""a must see"" and ""spectacular movie."" This film was able to attain the awards it did by capturing the audiences' emotions and running with them. Hooper used the bad economy, hardships of war, and recidivism as direct connections from the film to its audience and I believe this connection made the film win the awards it did and gain as much success as it gained."
"kwortha","9","1","2","24 February 2014"," A Directing Masterpiece
","""The time we live in is a postmodern age where a certain amount of irony is expected. This film is made without irony"" (Wioszcyna, ""Tom Hooper 'confused' by criticism of 'Les Mis'""). Tom Hooper, director for the box office hit Les Miserables (Hooper, 2012) defended his own film to interviewers when asked what he thought of some critics' response to his movie. Instead of caving to criticism, Hooper owned his movie had no postmodern charm of satire in it. While some critics view it a cheap and cheesy emotional manipulation, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) is a motion picture masterpiece because of the director's innovation in on-screen musicals, honest expression of raw emotions without irony, and the way he portrayed the themes. <br/><br/>Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) is an adaption of a Broadway musical to a movie. The complications with adapting a play to a screen are that the camera is a much more flexible medium than a stage and, specifically for musicals, the staged songs can seem forced and inorganic. However, director Tom Hooper and screenwriters were able to overcome theses difficulties. The camera work makes the play come alive as a video production. The singing in the film feels entirely organic because it was filmed on set. The actors actually had earpieces with a piano playing to keep them on key while they were shooting (IMBD.com). While the earpiece itself isn't revolutionary, the piano on the other end created a new way to film musicals. During the movie, the actor or actress singing set the tempo and the piano played along to the tempo he or she sang on camera. By allowing the natural tempo of the actors and actresses to rule the scenes, the songs sound as if the characters wrote them. <br/><br/>Some critics have pointed to the film's lack of irony as cheap emotional manipulation. However, as the director Tom Hooper pointed out, the object of the film was not to lighten the emotional story by making it satirical (Wioszcyna, ""Tom Hooper 'confused' by criticism of 'Les Mis'""). Through singing, the audience has a different emotional experience than in most movies. Crafted without irony in the plot, the movie sets a different tone. As New York Times critic Stanley Fish pointed out, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) defeats irony by not allowing the distance it requires. If you're looking right down the throats of the characters, there is no space between them and you; their perspective is your perspective"" (Fish, ""'Les Miserables' and Irony""). Because the film keeps the audience in the world of the performer, irony would have been out of place for the movie, and the director made a wise decision to leave the tone out. <br/><br/>The themes in Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) would not have been conducive for irony. The main two characters represent competing themes: mercy and justice. Valjean continually shows mercy to those around him after his turning point at the priest's house, Javert's anthem is always justice- to give each what is his due. At the end of the film, the resolution between the two competing morals shows that it is better to forgive and forbear. While rated PG13 by the MPAA (IMDb.com), the lessons in the movie are actually very relevant for any age. Because of violence and some sexuality, the film is not advised for small children but the story and the themes teach important values. <br/><br/>Through the moving songs, the themes were really the highlight of the film. With the emotion of poetry, each line exuded what that character stood for and it displayed characters through a different light than prose script would have shown them. By using the tempo the singer or actor set on film, the organic notes accented the point of the story: mercy triumphs over justice. If irony had been written into the tone of the movie, it would have lessened the power of the words in the songs and detracted from that main theme. Each part of Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) highlights the main struggle between Javert and Valjean, making it a masterpiece. None of this would have been possible without the abilities of Tom Hooper as director and his vision for the film. <br/><br/>An excellent example of his expertise in directing, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) shows Tom Hooper's innovation on screen, his wise judgment on the tone, and his masterful way of accenting and portraying the themes of the plot. Hooper's decisions to create the film, knowing it could incite some criticism, shows that he is a masterful director willing to look outside of the box for solutions in order to create something he can proudly defend to critics. Innovation in the techniques and tone, make Hooper's Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) worthy of the Oscars that it won. <br/><br/>Works Cited: Fish, Stanley.""'Les Miserables' and Irony.""

","Who knew that Hugh Jackman or Anne Hathaway had such great vocal talent? As soon as I began Les Misérables, I was immediately entranced by the voices and scenery that was pictured on screen. The actors, cinematography, and costuming instantly threw me back in time during the period of the French Revolution. Director Tom Hooper portrayed each aspect of this movie with such precision that not one character trait or object was out of sync with the era. The story unfolds over many years in 19th century France, as the impoverished and middle class attempt to revolt against the monarchy. <br/><br/>The movie begins with the musical talent of Hugh Jackman, who plays Jean Valjean a prisoner set free after being confined to a life of dishonesty. But his life quickly changes as he chooses to pursue a journey towards redemption after breaking his parole. The events that progress afterward ultimately lead him to his final salvation with God, as he watches over Cosette, daughter of Fantine. After experiencing an awful childhood Cosette, played by the talented Amanda Seyfried, pursues a life of happiness that her mother always dreamed for her. The love that Fantine has for Cosette is so strong it is hard to portray on screen, but the actress behind the role had no issue.<br/><br/>Academy Award winner – Anne Hathaway plays the dramatic role as Fantine, a middle-class woman, who gives up just about everything – and I mean everything - to save her daughter. To say that Hathaway can sing is an understatement because anyone listening to her is directly drawn to her character and the story in which she is telling. Her song ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is filled with such raw emotion that even the most impassive person could empathize for this woman. But not to just give credit to Anne Hathaway, the whole cast had such mesmerizing voices that were so real and believable it was if was I was experiencing every little thing that they were going through. Not to mention that director Tom Hooper had each actor sing live during the screening process, meaning every voice heard on screen was real. <br/><br/>To me this is the key to a great movie, believability, not allowing one part of the film to fall short of another, and I can vouch for Director Tom Hooper when I say that he did just that. From the original novel, to the Broadway stage version, to a previous movie adaptation, and now to Hooper's film revision, this classic tale has been used a lot. It is hard to keep the depth of a storyline when various directors attempt to draw a different type of audience, but Hooper was able to maintain all the key components to this historical masterpiece. Every scene, costume, song, and character flowed so well together that it was if you were to read straight from the original novel itself. There's a strong complexity of emotion that needed to be kept from scene to scene, and the costuming and scenery only developed the passion within. The tiniest effects made the greatest difference in this timeless tale of Les Misérables. The dirt under the fingernails, the worn and tattered clothing, and the off kilter buildings only emphasized the tiredness and rebellion of the era. <br/><br/>This modern remake of Les Misérables is a groundbreaking production in the film industry; thanks to its talented cast and accurate portrayal of the French Revolution era during 19th France. Director Tom Hooper's precision on the small details of the scenery, costuming, and cinematography only aided in the depth of the storyline, taking the audience back to this day and age. This movie is well worth the ticket, so why wait one day more?"

","The stage production of this had me in tears, the film version was even worse. I cried a lot; mostly because of the beautiful story, the powerful performances but of course the soul-wrenching music. Victor Hugo's story is one of the most beautiful and painful ever written and the musical score with all the motifs and themes is poetic and emotional as well as uplifting. The entire ensemble cast were clearly giving this one hundred per cent, and it shows. It was obviously difficult to film, live singing, and very difficult physical performances in terms of losing weight and looking pretty ragged, particularly for Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway and tells of the French aftermath of the Revolution.<br/><br/>The main characters are Jean Valjean (Jackman), Javert (Russell Crowe) and Fantine (Anne Hathaway), Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) also and Samantha Barks (Eponine) with special mention to child actors Isabelle Allen (young Cosette) and Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche). Hugh Jackman of course as a song and dance man did well in the main role of iconic Jean Valjean with a very powerful voice but surprise songbirds were Anne Hathaway who did well with the most well known song in the production ('I dreamed a dream') - excellently in fact and well deserved her Oscar - but Russell Crowe it seems also has a lovely warm voice and did well with his songs. Jackman and Hathaway were able to act and sing, which made their songs even more emotional but the best singer was definitely Redmayne as Marius, the character almost a mirror of Victor Hugo himself and his rendition of 'Empty chairs and empty tables' I didn't know I had that many tears left to cry! It's a lavish, grand production, and the Direction and cinematography was flawless and had done well to copy/use inspiration from the stage production.<br/><br/>The film is unbelievable emotive, and the saving grace of some of the comic moments in the story/play were not so well done, and Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen weren't the comedy players they needed to be to lighten the mood and be laugh out loud funny. The scenes in the Inn and the wedding were lacking and the film therefore was overwhelmed with the tragedy. It's the sort of film you have to be in the right mood for as it's just not uplifting enough to be a happy watch. You don't always want to be sitting sobbing, and I cried a lot at this - the music was incredibly emotive.<br/><br/>A superb epic film. Spectacle, emotion and outstanding performances."

","Superb movie. I saw the Broadway show. Loved it. Loved the music. I have the CD's. I know it pretty much by heart now. I also have other film versions of Hugo's masterpiece, but they are not musicals. This film version tops them all. It even helped me understand a few things not obvious in other versions. Anne Hathaway as Fantine is so, so good - her interpretation of 'I Dreamed a Dream' became a classic the second I saw it. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is excellent and very believable. Eddie Redmayne is a very good Marius and seems so sincere - his role became more important to me than in previous versions of plays or films. Russell Crowe as Javert is not that good though. That is not his element it seems; he is not bad, just a bit too ordinary. The Thénardiers are funny, a bit over the edge though, but it helps keeping the movie from being too 'serious'. Surprising role for Helena Bonham Carter, but she is very good. Is was a very nice gesture to have Colm Wilkinson as Bishop of Digne since he played Jean Valjean so often on Broadway and West End versions of the play. True to the original story. Better than the Broadway show even, I must say. Must see, large screen if you can."

In 2012 it made it to the big screen a huge, lavish, spectacularly assembled vision of the story from director Tom Hooper, with a colossal $60,000,000 budget at his fingertips and a cast of heavyweight actors in the lead roles. With so much expectation upon its shoulders and so many challenges to be overcome in execution, does Les Misérables pull it all off? The answer is a resounding yes - this is a splendid film, one of the very best of its year in fact. <br/><br/>Convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) endures nineteen years of miserable imprisonment after being caught stealing a loaf of bread. When his time is up, he is released by ruthless prison guard Javert (Russell Crowe) and told to keep to the strict conditions of his parole or else be brought back to jail at once. After unsuccessfully attempting to steal some silverware from a preacher (Colm Wilkinson), Valjean looks destined to a swift return to life in shackles. He is offered an unexpected reprieve when the preacher lies on his behalf, claiming to the police that he gave the silverware to Valjean and that it wasn't stolen at all. Touched by this act of kindness, Valjean vows to change his ways and his life for ever more. He skips parole and heads off to begin anew Javert meanwhile swears to hunt him down, no matter how far he must go or how long it will take. The rest of the film traces Valjean's adventures over the next few decades, with Javert entering the picture from time to time to force him to flee for his life. Valjean ends up helping a dying prostitute, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), by saving her illegitimate daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen) from a life of misery and raising her as his own. He also helps a number of young French revolutionaries in their fight against government soldiers. One of the young revolutionaries, Marius (Eddie Redmayne), is madly in love with the grown-up Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) and Valjean determines to make it his last duty to protect him from harm so that they may live in happiness.<br/><br/>Les Misérables is exhausting in many ways, putting its audience through an emotional wringer before the credits roll. It is, however, a very well-made movie, sticking closely to the show while 'opening out' its stagebound source very effectively. Epic widescreen shots combine with intense close-ups, making the story grander in conception than the stage version whilst allowing the actors to show far more via facial expression than is ever possible on stage. The stage version relies on the songs to convey much of its feeling; in the film the camera is able to linger on faces, capturing the many subtle nuances the actors lend to their characters. Jackman is excellent as Valjean (this is his best performance to date); Crowe struggles slightly with the singing aspects of his Javert role but more than compensates in conveying the dogged determination of the character. Hathaway's fifteen minute turn as Fantine is also excellent. The weakest aspect of the film is a slight sag in the middle. The section detailing preparations for the Parisian revolution is a little over-cooked, while the romance between Marius and Cosette is unpersuasive in its suddenness. The same segment is the weak link in the stage show too, and this film version is unable to correct the flaw. It is, however, a minor flaw. Overall Les Misérables is a cracker – a moving, triumphant, powerful cinematic experience."

","During the film I gradually downgraded my initial 10/10 expectation to a score of five. I had this film earmarked as a special viewing treat for some time so was really surprised at how much I didn't like it.<br/><br/>I knocked off a mark first of all because I couldn't get through it all in one sitting. That's bad, but then again that could be attributed to something else.<br/><br/>Victor Hugo's novel is a really exciting read, so I knocked off another mark for the film being so pedestrian. Granted, trying to condense such a body of work into a couple of hours is hard, but that usually results in inaccuracies, not drudge-like film entertainment.<br/><br/>The singing by Hugh Jackman was valiant but irritating. His voice is whiny and not up to the job, while Russell Crowe, unfortunately, was even worse. Big names, star-studded cast, but horrible sonics. Another mark erased.<br/><br/>But the worst aspect of all was the musical score. Two marks off. Listening to the main characters recounting their thoughts in song sounded, instead, like they were just making it up on the spot. I had difficulty believing many of the songs had a pre-defined structure at all. Considering virtually the whole film was in song, how could they have penned something so dull?<br/><br/>There were some good aspects to the film such as the inclusion of Sacha Baron Cohen, who is universally excellent, the parts with pretty Anne Hathaway, as well as some of the close up, portrait-like cinematography, but I couldn't help feeling the cast selection was an unimaginative rehash of other musicals/period dramas, especially the clichéd inclusion of Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>If you've seen 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' you'll appreciate how a musical should be done. It's witty, has great songs and has an underpinning dark and cynical nature to it.<br/><br/>LM has great actors, who don't act, but try to sing-talk instead, emphasising the director's tactic of using big names instead of concentrating on good singing.<br/><br/>To be fair to the cast and production crew, it's a musical ruined by a weak score."

","I should know better. It's not the movies fault or the original Musical, that I couldn't really enjoy this properly. I cannot for that matter compare this to other productions (be it stage or book form) of the subject matter. Obviously the movie covers a bit of History here, but it's the main characters that are the real attractions. Speaking of which: Wolverine, I mean Hugh Jackman gives the (oral) performance of his life! If anyone was doubting he could act, he more than proves it here, shouldering the movie amongst other things.<br/><br/>While Anne Hatheway did spoil a bit (of her part/character), at least to me, she's equally enticing as is the rest of the cast. Even the sometimes misplaced looking Crowe. But he only looks slightly the way I felt about most of the singing. A movie that lasts over 2 hours and consists of 90 % of singing ... So you might want to add one or two points to my vote, unless you are fond of the book as a friend of mine is.

","After checking out some of the other reviews, I've come to realize that this is a movie you either love or hate. Of course I think it is an exaggeration to give any movie that has won three Oscars only 1/10, because obviously it has its highs AND lows. I've given it 8/10 just for the sake of that, though I love this movie to bits personally and would rate it a 20. Here are some subjects of negative reviews that I'd like to address properly, so that newbies can get a true sense of Les Mis. <br/><br/>Some fans go in expecting the movie to be as grand as the musical, which in the singing aspect is not. And you can't really expect any more, can you? Hugh Grant, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway etc. are actors who an sing, unlike on Broadway when the characters are singers who can act. It is the acting that is the higher element here - if they wanted it to be the other way around, the directors would have hired singers, but that would have detrimentally damaged the film seeing that singers are SINGERS and not exactly actors. Granted, some notes were painful, but I think they did a pretty good job (the minor characters especially - Bravo Marius, Eponine and Enjolras!). <br/><br/>The ""lack of spoken dialogue"" complaint is by far the most confusing. This isn't Moulin Rouge or High School Musical - this is a legit MUSICAL with music and singing. The spoken words are meant as connectors in the film to assist scenes. We should be glad there is so much anyways! The real musical has ZERO. Sure it's easier to talk, but that's not the point of the film, is it?<br/><br/>Others say it was far too long, but if the movie was compacted into a regular hour-and-a-half film, I'm sure it would have even been worse. Parts would have been cut, and the fans outraged. So lets just accept the fact it is just as long as LOTR and move along. The story line may be confusing to a first-timer or one who hasn't read the book, but I guess the real question is why haven't you already seen the musical or read the book yet? Just humouring you. But really, the real musical must be even more confusing, seeing that the actors stand in front of microphones and there's little props - no brothels or inns or ledges to jump off of. The movie really isn't too hard to piece together, and if you still have trouble watch it again or read the book or see the real musical or watch the un-singing version. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie captures elements of the book and the musical into one crazy cool creation. So Bravo Les Mis! You deserve every ounce of praise."

","Known to theatre going enthusiasts, Les Mis has run for a successful 27 years and is still thrilling many people due, to the famous musical numbers. Tom Hooper's version will captivate the audience with an explosive cast, delivering emotional performances. The risky approach, Hooper takes with the non-stop singing performances seems to pay off, supported by gritty aesthetic and well represented costumes and settings, to transport you back in time. Jackman and Crowe complement each other with strength and bravery, portrayed through their unexpectedly impressive vocals. This is supported by Anne Hathway, the emotional stand alone feminist with her unbeatable rendition of I dream a dream. (Watch out Su-bo!) Light can be seen through this depressive era, as Sacha Bohen and Helen Bonham Carter bring a little comedy to the production, Playing the innkeepers. <br/><br/>Captivating and mesmerising, Hooper delivers an award winning piece, and Danny Cohen's cinematography will stun the audience. With a host of finely selected actors, who surely will be recognised at the Oscars."

","Have you ever experienced a feeling where you slide down your chair, your jaw drops and thick tears emerge from your eyes? If not, I would recommend watching Les Miserables. I can't remember the last time I shed a tear or two, before this film. It was beautiful in every way possible! <br/><br/>Previous to watching Les Miserables I had no knowledge of the plot, only of several characters and that it takes place my years ago. What got to me most was that throughout the film there was so much going on behind just what was being sung. For example, how throughout the film the main character, Jean Valjean, learns by harsh punishment of the law for stealing bread for his sisters son. He comes out years later, scared but determined to make a change while being humble and has an eventual heart for forgiveness. After several interventions with the one who punished him and represented the law, Javert, he finally has the chance to show no mercy and step down to the level of the unjust law, and kill him as the law killed the young boy- without mercy. Though, Valjean learns to forgive and not punish an individual for obeying his commander's orders, the ignorant criminals behind the law. Oh, it was so beautiful, I couldn't believe it. <br/><br/>Every actor did a sensational job fulfilling their character, even Crowe who for me was tough to see being in a film like this before. It was innovative and the production value was above what I had dreamed of. Every aspect of this film had something essential in the plot and I'm sure when I watch this film again, I'll run into new themes and ideas. Time flew by when this film was on the surround sound system at home (which is a must). Incredible!"

","Not only is Ann Hathaway the greatest ""Cat Woman"" ever, but she also won an Oscar for best supporting actress in a roll with limited on screen time that probably should not have qualified for a nomination in the first place. Yes! She is that good! It would have been simple to cast seasoned Broadway performers throughout the movie, but the brilliant cast choices will surely bring in some curious onlookers who otherwise would stay away. Russel Crowe gave an adequate performance, but did not quite capture ""Javert"" as the relentless,heartless,despicable and sadistic individual that he was. Hugh Jackman continues to demonstrate his great versatility. Is there anything he can't do? Samantha Barks, Eddy Redmayne, and Aaron Tveit helped to elevate the whole production to new heights with their amazing voices. At times the movie was breathtaking,but it did seem to drag on. It is much too long and even the die-hard fans were starting to fidget in their seats. Les Miserable 2012 is not going to attract legions of new fans, but the appetite of the staunch followers of the stage production will surely be satisfied."
"GTeixeira","5","1","2","27 April 2013"," Watchable musical
","The classical Victor Hugo story of an ex-convict who tries to create a new life for himself, becoming a well-respected man, while trying to flee from a law-abiding policeman who refuses to believe he changed. <br/><br/>Except done in musical style.<br/><br/>I should begin the review by stating that I don't like musicals. They are often overly silly or flat-out bad, either for their over-the-top cheeriness (the old musical from the 40's/50's) or in their try to be dramatic/serious ('Chicago' or 'Moulin Rouge' for example). It's rare for them to have actual great music or consistently good singing voices.<br/><br/>That said, the fact I managed to watch 'Les Misérables' with relative ease says a lot of this. It is a visually beautiful movie, managing to capture well the imagery we have of 19th century France; the very first scene of the movie was enough to sell it to me. The story is quite faithful to the book's too, which is already a great start.<br/><br/>I felt somewhat mixed at the acting/singing. Hugh Jackman was probably a surprise to most, being more remembered for the tough 'Wolverine' character than as a dramatic actor (ie.: 'The Fountain'); still, I was quite surprised that he did a good singing. I felt he exaggerated once in a while, but nothing to stain his overall performance.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe was maybe the highest point to me, though I have seen most people disagree. His singing was actually quite good to my ears, not giving his character a forced authority that a stronger voice would give; his authority is shown more from his posture/actions and that made him gripping to watch. His Inspector Javert was easily the character I liked the most in this, being much more humanized than every other adaptation of this story, even sympathetic, and his songs are my favorites from the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't like the rest much. Sacha Baron Cohen is funny as always, but a terrible singer; both Amanda Seyfried and Helena Bonham Carter are awful too and their singing was almost unwatchable. I actually had to fast forward most of Seyfried's scenes. They really bring the movie down a lot.<br/><br/>I felt Anne Hathaway was quite overrated in here. Admittedly, she does a very good acting job, conveying the pain and grief of her character very well, but she's not a very good singer; too many high pitches, and too much melodrama.<br/><br/>The film also makes the revolution, the climax of the story, very good to watch. While undeniably left-leaning, in here the June Rebellion is an outright communist-styled revolution; inadvertently, this only made me sympathize more with the so-called 'oppressors' (like Javert) and happy when the revolution was crushed (the exact opposite of what the film was probably hoping for). The fact the rebellion's face was a preppy, not-poor liberal student only makes it better.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a beautiful visual achievement and quite watchable, but far from great. The singing is good at points but awful at most others, and the acting is overall good. I would have preferred seeing this cast do a non-musical version of the story."

","Global stage phenomenon Les Misérables comes to the silver screen courtesy of Oscar winning director Tom Hooper (Kings Speech).<br/><br/>Based on the rousing Victor Hugo novel set at the time of the French revolution, a story of redemption, vengeance, love and added singing, lots of singing.<br/><br/>I will provide a definite warning, the cast sing ALL the way through, there are only two spoken lines. I repeat, they sing ALL the way through, if you cannot deal with that, then this is not the movie for you, there will be no more warnings.<br/><br/>John Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is first seen hauling a Galleon into dry dock, along with hundreds of other convicts being lashed with waves. Incarcerated for years for only stealing a loaf of bread for his sister's hungry child. Looking down upon him in every sense, is his nemesis Javert (Russell Crowe), a man who if sliced in two, would have ""duty"" written through him like a stick of seaside rock candy.<br/><br/>Eventually paroled, Valjean is persecuted and moves from place to place. Driven to a further crime, he is saved, finds religion and becomes a respectable well loved businessman, hiding his secret past. Following an unintended tragedy, for which he was only partially to blame, he finds redemption by caring for a young child.<br/><br/>The story then becomes embroiled with not only first stirrings of the French revolution but also his charge Cosette (Amanda Seyfield), who falls in love with a young revolutionary Marius (Eddie Redmayne).<br/><br/>Meanwhile Javert, clearly a man you would not cheat against at Scrabble, pursues his long lost adversary, obsessed with ensuring ""justice"" is done.<br/><br/>The film requires a lot of the cast, Hooper deciding to portray a very real, down and dirty Paris. The unfortunate poor are made to look just that, unfortunate and very poor. Sores, hideous teeth and a stylised down and out feel, into which our doomed heroine must fall. Fantine, Cosette's mother (Anne Hathaway), is cast into the abyss never to return.<br/><br/>Hathaway is simply stunning in this role, shorn of her locks and subjected to her fate, she belts out ""I Dreamed a dream"" in a way no one could have envisaged. Red raw and racked with emotion it is almost uncomfortable to watch, a stunning performance.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman acquits himself well, we know he can hold a tune and dance, Seyfield has a beautiful voice and gets to look lovestruck at appropriate moments. The other stand-out is Eddie Redmayne, who not only provides a solid acting performance but throws in a voice that most did not know he possessed. Impressive stuff indeed and his star status is sure to climb after this film.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, clearly not a natural born singer is like a man thrown into a swimming pool who cannot swim. The fact that he manages to get to the other side, makes his effort and bravery that much more laudable. His acting however is as solid and believable as ever, enabling a rather daft role to seem at least vaguely plausible.<br/><br/>Sacha Cohen Baron somewhat surprisingly, yet again proves that he can act, providing dramatic comic relief with Helena Bonham Carter, with her usual mad hair in, or rather out of place.<br/><br/>Downsides, the film is long and if you are not keen on musicals, like this reviewer, this film will most definitely not change your mind. The emotion is raw and tears flow freely, certainly the cast given free reign to emote on an industrial scale.<br/><br/>Whilst undeniably the set piece songs provide a crescendo of emotion, when the scene finishes the movie feels flat until the next head of steam is built up for the next rousing song. A tune that you may be humming to yourself a week later, despite your best intention not to do so. On occasion the enterprise feels like a high school musical on steroids, with minor characters straight from central casting but clearly the cast are having fun, belting out well known tunes, clothed in superb costumes on big budget sets and locations.<br/><br/>Not being a musical fan, one wonders why all the lines need to be sung, some songs seem like filler but perhaps this is missing the whole point of a musical. The film is immeasurably better than the stage play, as the story is explained better and provides better context to the numerous songs. There is no question that without the talented ""A list"" cast, the film would have floundered.<br/><br/>Incidentally, all singing was captured live with microphones sewn into the actors costumes, which then picks up all the ambient sounds. A novel and unusual approach that is sure to be copied, rather than the usual miming to a soundtrack recorded in the studio.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Rousing stuff, with some excellent performances, a risky project that could have left the ""A list"" cast list high and dry, but has paid off handsomely due mainly to the talent on display.<br/><br/>If you enjoy musicals, there is much to enjoy here. For those with even a mild case of ""musicalaphobia"" be aware that this may not be for you.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

","Les MostlyAbles<br/><br/>I first discovered the stage musical version of Les Miserables at age sixteen on a trip that my high school theater department took to New York. It was love at first sight (sound?). I don't think that I have ever literally cried so many times in a few hours in my whole life. It quickly became my favorite Broadway show ever (okay, tied with Cabaret). Obviously, when it comes to musical theater, I pull a little to the dark side. Which is why I was concerned when I found out that Tom Hooper the (okay, yes, Oscar winning) director of The King's Speech was going to be helming the long awaited film adaptation of the play. After all, this is the director who turned a story about disability and World War into a charming little lark about an unlikely friendship and now he chooses to take on the bloodiest, gloomiest musical ever made.<br/><br/>Despite my reservations about what manner of mood shifts Mr. Hooper might bring to the piece, I couldn't deny that he had assembled an amazing cast and my anticipations ran VERY high. Word that he was going to make the innovative move of having the actors singing live within the scenes rather than prerecording the voice tracks only fanned the flames of my excitement. ""So..."", I hear you wondering, ""Did Mr. Hooper remain true to the starkness of his source material or fall prey to his schmaltzier tendencies?"". The answer, sort of dispassionately, is: a little of both to be honest.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the choice to have the actors sing live was a rousing 95% success. One actor's lack of musical proclivity may have been accentuated, but the honesty of emotion that it lent to the rest of the performances is undeniable. Hooper was also able to pull some terrific work out of MOST of the cast, as he did in The King's Speech. The man is obviously a gifted actor's director. <br/><br/>On the not so positive side, those with cinematically weak stomachs might want to take some Lactaid before viewing a FEW of the scenes. I'll just give one quick example. In the stage play, the song One Day More ends the first act as all of the characters join in slowly until it creates a tableau of the players that freezes with several members of the general cast hoisting French flags to complete the picture. While slightly contrived, this is an accepted convention of stage craft that works in that medium. In conversion to film, Hooper chose to show all of the individual characters singing their parts of One Day More in the separate locations where they would logically be at the time, which is great. On the final note, however, Hooper flashes to random French citizens hoisting French flags in the street for no apparent reason and then cuts with no segue whatsoever to what was designed to be the beginning of Act II, Scene I, presented after an intermission. This climax and (lack of) transition significantly undermine the inherent power of one of the most affecting numbers in the production.<br/><br/>Besides a few cheesy directorial flourishes such as these, I really only find two faults with the film. I really hate singling actors out and he's already taken a lot of flack from almost every reviewer on the planet, but this is not Russell Crowe's finest hour (or two and a half hours, but why quibble?). Suffice it to say that this usually far more capable actor is horridly miscast, mostly because his singing is always strained and often slightly off key. His acting suffers as well in the struggle to over-compensate. My other gripe with the film is the Original Song ""Suddenly"" which lacks the (abundant) inspiration so obvious in the original libretto. It was obviously thrown in just to garner one more Oscar nomination (which it did) and does nothing to enhance the already lengthy production.<br/><br/>I'm sure by now it sounds like I didn't like Les Miserables and this could not be further from the truth. There is a lot of really good stuff going on. My personal affection for the source material just makes me very tough to satisfy completely. However, I would recommend the movie for exposure to the story and music alone. I have seen the film criticized for concentrating too much on the love story as if were some typical musical comedy but this could not be further from the truth. Les Miserables is no simple happy-go-lucky boy meets girl tale. Instead, it is a story about love can make the world a better place even in the most seemingly impossible situations: love of freedom, the love of a parent for a child, love of humanity, the love of God, and...yes...romantic love.

I'm glad I saw it; my review will be as brief as the movie was long.<br/><br/>There are few cultural classics like Victor Hugo's Les Misérables and Edmond Dantès' The Count of Monte Cristo to have stirred the reader in me as a youth, and thankfully now, both have been put to the screen so that the masses can enjoy some art which the privileged and well to do can share. The movie was an audacious venture, the actors who played key characters get their rewards from having been involved in the project and perhaps only few will get the little golden statuette; certainly, Anne Hathaway has the best shot at this.

"apollinnaire","6","1","2","9 February 2013"," Harsh cuts, swift insights and bi-emotionalism
","When you make a film, you make choices. Aiming at a 2-hour-something film and bearing in mind that major deviations from the cult musical would not be acceptable by the public, Hooper had his hands tied. Not being allowed a completely new, more minimalistic view on the original story and having to include the public's favorite hits, he is guilty of trying to include as many existing elements as possible into the film (so as to please every attentive die-hard fan), making it forcefully rather rushed. Victor Hugo's novel is several volumes long for a reason and making an all-in-one film like they made abridged versions of the novel was perhaps not the best choice, as far as the art of filming is concerned.<br/><br/>While we never lost track of Valjean and Javert's game, we lost focus on some characters that are beautifully portrayed yet not deeply explored. So, we ended up with a film full of shallow characters of which we never know much about for the sake of an epic tale. All characters are introduced and all come to an end but they remain strangers to the uninitiated viewer. I talk, for example, of the pitiable Fantine whose painful descent is less than 15 minutes long, of Valjean's journey from the gutter to wealth, his newly discovered God, this Javert who was born inside a jail, the Thénardiers as nomads, this Marius who traded aristocratic comfort for filth, these students who represent a different ideal, each of them, the passion that moves this enigmatic Enjolras, the fake cynicism and self-loathing that throw Grantaire into alienation, the romantic idealism of the barricades... only so would we understand the true meaning of the masterpiece's title. <br/><br/>Victor Hugo wrote about a misery that finds its way into glory. Hooper shot the film in two acts. Act I, Crying, Act II, Fighting. A strange way of putting misery and glory in pragmatic terms. The cut between acts is harsh and the last one is clearly trying to make up for the second as far as the typical commercial factors are concerned. <br/><br/>The choice of close-up is interesting (trying to make up for the earlier implied anonymity, perhaps). The quick-moving cameras, not so much. A dramatic moment like the death of little Gavroche and our chance to peek into his lifeless eyes calls for a slower motion. Fantine's solo is a fac-simile of Dreyer's Jeanne D'Arc phenomenon. Javert's Stars is filmed with such swift movements we lost the stern intensity of the moment. An exception for the remarkably sensitive eye cast on Éponine's soliloquy and the perfect depiction of Enjolras' final provocation and death."

","It's big and it's loud and it's (very) long. The sets, locations and costumes are stunning, capturing vividly the squalor of revolutionary Paris (and that's before the scene in the sewers): full marks to the designer as well as the director and cinematographer. The acting is of a very high order indeed.<br/><br/>But. It's a big but. This is a musical - and the singing is not of a very high order. Russell Crowe wasn't as bad as I expected: he reminded me of Richard Harris as King Arthur in CAMELOT, croaking along in a way that was not too far from melodious. Hugh Jackman wasn't as good as I expected, given that he's sung in stage musicals. His big number, 'Bring Him Home' (one of the stage show's show-stoppers), didn't have the emotional impact of Colm Wilkinson's original in the theatre (Jackman sings it in high tenor rather than boy soprano). Anne Hathaway's rendition of Fantine's 'The Dream I Dreamed' finally displaces Susan Boyle's as a re-definition of the song; it is literally heart-breaking and is the movie's musical high point. Samantha Barks also delivers a touching version of Eponine's 'On My Own' , but I seriously disliked Amanda Seyfried as Cosette: her voice had a vibrato more suited to Handel or a Jessie Matthews tribute show.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne was pretty good as Marius and has a pleasing singing voice, although perhaps the 'romantic lead' called for someone a bit more lyrical. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen had their roles as the comic-relief Thenardiers pruned; their 'high society' scene at the end was cruelly truncated. The ensemble pieces ('One Day More' etc) were, if anything, even more powerful than on the stage. Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone) sung as if he was in OLIVER, which is how the role should be sung!<br/><br/>The director's decision to have most of the dialogue sung rather than spoken was a brave one and doesn't entirely work - although this is how the stage version, like EVITA, is performed. Both Crowe and Jackman often sound very flat in these 'recitative' passages and it is here that the movie loses pace. <br/><br/>The spectacle and the narrative sweep of LES MISERABLES are fully captured, but the pathos of the stage show (a lot of characters are killed off) is slightly diminished, just as happened with Spielberg's film of WAR HORSE. Perhaps because LES MIS is more opera than musical, it needs the 'intimacy' of a theatre for its magic to work completely: operas do not generally translate to cinema unless they are filmed stage productions. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the cast here as well as the director have taken a brave stand at the barricades. At the end of the day ('you're another day older') it is a lot more entertaining - and better box-office - to have actors struggling to sing than singers struggling to act."

","Some factions consider this an ""opera,"" some consider it ""musical theater.""

Valjean cares for, brings up as her only parent, an orphan girl and in that process achieves his own redemption. <br/><br/>Set in 1810-1860 era France, it deals with class & gender inequities, retaliative laws & punishments, etc., then prevalent in France as well as much of Western civilization (& with vestiges today).<br/><br/>Stunning settings, excellent acting, but it was too much like some less preferred opera for me.

","For a story that is quite so well known and has been told time and time again in every imaginable format and media, this one is still surprisingly engaging.<br/><br/>The songs are well known and the singing is flawless. The scenes are familiar yet the visuals are stunning because they feel authentic. You know, right from the start, that every person involved fully believes in character they are portraying. It certainly is a well made movie.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman ages beautifully over the span of the 18 odd years while Russell Crowe is convincingly unyielding. Anne Hathaway and Eddie Redmayne pull all the right strings. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Cater are delightfully despicable. My favourites however are Daniel Huttlestone as the little Gavroche and Samantha Barks as Eponine. Both bring in their own unique style and yet blend right into the tumultuous fabric of the story.<br/><br/>Having said all of this (and found my eyes wet at the scene in which Fantine returns to comfort Valjean as he passes on) I still found myself looking at the clock many times during the run to see how much more of the melodrama I had to take!<br/><br/>I'd call it a valiant though head-on-the-shoulder effort"

","I'm going to start by saying that I'm reviewing this film as someone who knew nothing about this story before the film was released. I haven't seen the play / read the book etc. so I am only reviewing the film.<br/><br/>I've read some comments that ""you have to know the background to understand"" etc. and this really annoys me. By that logic, all films are fantastic because we should be able to fill in the plot holes ourselves and we should expect to have to continue a storyline in our own minds to make sure the film makes sense...<br/><br/>The main reason for giving the film 6 out of 10 is that anything I don't switch off i.e. anything I watch all the way through, gets an automatic 5 and then if there are any good points on top of that, I will increase my rating.<br/><br/>The film gets a 6 from me because (as you'd expect with this type of Oscar-bait film) all of the actors give their best and we get to see some fantastic performances from everybody involved.<br/><br/>My problem with the film is that it just wasn't a very good story.<br/><br/>Again; I'm sure the novel went into so much more detail but that's not what I'm criticising here. The story as depicted in the film is extremely bare and jumps from one ""monologue"" to another with some grand scenes and often random musical numbers in between. A lot of the time the singing is annoying because the songs are not particularly memorable (a few are very good) - sometimes people just start singing their lines without there being a real song. I'm not sure how to explain that but it's annoying!<br/><br/>It feels like in order to give every actor their ""15 minutes"" they don't have time to really develop each plot. Some things happen that just make absolutely no sense and are not explained - I don't care if it's explained in the book - if you want to make a film then try to make a good film; don't make a bad film and tell people who criticise you that they should read the book!<br/><br/>There are many great elements in this film as mentioned already; the acting but also some of the musical numbers really are great and clearly a lot of effort went into this but given that they had two and a half hours to develop the plot, I don't think there's really an excuse for the lack of plot and character development.<br/><br/>Congrats to them for finding a young girl to play Cosette who looks almost identical to the portrait on the original novel (or so says my limited Wikipedia-research). The poster for this film is really eye-catching. Now, when you have higher praise for the marketing team and casting than the film makers, you know there may be a problem.<br/><br/>Worth watching but not the epic it's made out to be and whilst the actors and set designers etc. deserve awards, the film itself does not I'm afraid.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I am currently reading the book--I am through about 7% of it according to my Kindle, so the first 5 minutes covered what I had read already, and I was really not prepared for this epic story of redemption and loss. I should have known to bring a box of tissues because my father in law had cried all the way through it.<br/><br/>I was a little leery of watching a 3 hour musical in a theater (I do not typically go to movies at all), but a friend wanted to go. The the music and lyrics really supported the story line, and deepened the pathos of the characters. <br/><br/>In the opening scene the lyrics were a little hard to understand, but it got better, and for the most part solos were completely understandable, while the choruses were a little garbled at times. That was worth maybe a point of one rating star.<br/><br/>The one real beef I have is that in the tavern scene, I just really did not think it was necessary to see a prostitute WITH ""Santa"" in a very graphic few seconds....and he would not have been called Santa at that point in history, and don't think he is called ""Santa"" in France. So for gratuitous sex that did not add anything to the story, I knocked it down 2 stars, and another .8 of a star for glaring lack of historicity.

","I have seen the musical on Broadway several times and have viewed the various Les Mis movies. I was looking forward to the movie based on the musical. In many ways it did not disappoint. There are some outstanding vocal performances (Marius, Fontaine and Eponine) Hugh Jackman managed to pull off the vocally demanding Val Jean. However the vocal mix was a bit strange, with the beautiful orchestrations buried. That is until the last song, when the surround sound seemed to kick in. The recitatives which carry the plot along might have been better spoken then sung. And Javier was a huge disappointment. While there were a number of cinematic scenes that really enhanced the musical, I just didn't feel like it was as well adapted as other musicals. Powerful yet lacking."
"howard.schumann","9","1","2","6 January 2013"," Reaches the heart in a big way
","Based on the 1862 French novel by Victor Hugo and the musical of the same name, Tom Hooper's Les Misérables is a moving experience that, despite its flaws, reaches the heart in a big way with its depiction of the wretched conditions of the poor and its theme of forgiveness, sacrifice, and redemption. The film is notable for towering performances by Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, and others plus great songs written by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil. There is no spoken dialogue and everyone in the film sings. Some do it effectively, others not so much, but the fact that the songs are performed live rather than pre-recorded, expands the emotional content, enhancing rather than detracting from the overall impact of the music. As well, repeated close-ups create a feeling of intimacy with the singers that can be missing on stage<br/><br/>The time period of Les Misérables spans 10-40 years after the end of the French Revolution. Hugh Jackman is Jean Valjean, a convict, imprisoned for nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and repeated efforts to escape. As the film opens, Valjean is paroled but policeman Javert (Russell Crowe), a staunch defender of the status quo, vows to follow him and hunt him down. Impoverished and hungry, Valjean takes refuge in a church where he is welcomed by the Bishop of Digne (Colin Wilkerson) and given food and a place to stay. In the scene that follows, the film first establishes one of its main themes, that of forgiveness. Valjean, doing what he has always done, steals silver from the church but is caught by the police and returned to the church. <br/><br/>In a key moment of the film, instead of being punished, the bishop pretends that the silver was given freely to Valjean and even gives him some candles that he allegedly forgot. This act of kindness will stay with Valjean and transform his life. Eight years later, Valjean, still being pursued by Javert, has changed his name to Monsieur Madeleine and has carved out a new life for himself as a respected mayor and factory owner in the small town of Vigau. Fantine (Anne Hathaway), an employee in his factory is harassed by fellow workers and fired by her manager when he finds out that she has given birth to a child out of wedlock. <br/><br/>The little girl, Cosette (Isabelle Allen), is looked after by unsavory innkeepers Monsieur and Madame Thenardier (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) who provide some comic relief, though their presence can seem extraneous and jarring. To stay alive and care for her child Fantine must sell her hair and teeth and turn to prostitution, a demonstration, according to Hooper, of the ideal of sacrifice. Fantine is willing to lose everything, her body, her life, to try to save her child. In one of the film's highlights, Hathaway's magnificent performance of the song, ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" is delivered with searing emotion as she sings about how life has killed her dreams. <br/><br/>Valjean visits Fantine on her death bed and promises to rescue Cosette from the Thénardiers and raise her as his daughter. The film then moves ahead nine years. Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), now a teenager, has fallen in love with Marius (Eddie Redmayne), a student revolutionary who is also being sought after by Eponine (Samantha Barks), the young daughter of the Thénardiers. In what has become known as the June uprising of 1832, Marius joins with his friend Enjolras (Aaron Tveit) and his supporters in establishing the Friends of the ABC, a group seeking to free the oppressed lower class of France by rising against the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Phillipe and establishing a new French Republic. <br/><br/>One of the inspirations behind the uprising is a young boy, Gavroche (Daniel Huddlestone), who becomes a symbol of the ideals of the rebellion. Manning barricades in the streets, the revolutionaries, vastly outnumbered by government forces, are inspired by such songs as ""Red and Black,"" and ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" The songs say that, ""When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums, there is a life about to start - when tomorrow comes, and asks us to reflect on the question has that relevance today ""Have you asked of yourselves - what's the price you might pay?"" Marius, who has paid a dear price in the crushing of the revolt and the death of many of his friends in the battle sings the soulful ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,"" one of the most moving anthems of the film. <br/><br/>Though there would not be another student revolt until 1848, the stirring message of Les Misérables touches our yearning for freedom and justice. Hugo is a humanist and the story is a joint examination of radical politics and the need for forgiveness and kindness, of whether the Red of Love is more important than the Red of Revolution. Les Misérables is more than a grand spectacle and musical extravaganza. Its message of opposing social injustice and the domination of the many by the few also reminds us that charity and compassion must be the unifying force in any attempt to change the system."
"georgep53","10","1","2","6 January 2013"," Magnificent
","Victor Hugo's epic novel about the search for justice in an unjust world is a full throttle smash of a musical motion picture. Hugh Jackman puts aside the adamantium claws of Wolverine to assume one of musical theater's great leading roles as Jean Valjean a man severely punished by a depraved justice system for stealing bread to feed a starving child. Jackman is Valjean in costume and in expression as he journeys from anger and bitterness to redemption thanks to the intervention of an act of kindness whose ripples eventually shake the foundation of a merciless police official. When Jackman sings the show-stopping ""Bring Him Home"" it is an awe-inspiring moment. Can Valjean's pleas move the supreme author of creation to rescue an idealistic young man dreaming of a just society? Russell Crowe brings a powerful presence to the role of Inspector Javert the sworn enemy of Valjean. He will never stop persecuting a man for a moment of weakness no matter how small the infraction. Anne Hathaway pours her soul into the role of Fantine a young woman with child whose dreams have turned into despair. Hathaway deserves the praise she is receiving and I also loved the work of Samantha Barks as Eponine a woman whose yearning for a man who doesn't love her is the subject of the beautiful ballad ""On My Own"". Eddie Redmayne is a picture of conviction as a young revolutionary. Helen Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen are the whimsically corrupt Thenardiers who operate an inn that becomes the home of Fantine's daughter Cosette.<br/><br/>Director Tom Hooper and his art directors create a vivid 19th century Dickensian world of industrial misery. The spectacular Schonberg/Boublil/Jean-Marc Natel score has memorable production numbers such as those at the Paris barricades and quiet, intimate ones poignantly performed. The great tenor, Colm Wilkinson, Jean Valjean in the original 1987 Broadway cast, has a small role. LES MISERABLES is a great motion picture and I can't wait to see it again."
"jburtroald95","9","1","2","5 January 2013"," Incredible screen adaptation of one of the greatest of all musicals
","The story of Legendary French author Victor Hugo's classic novel Les Misérables is one of those complex, epic timeless tales that instantly inspire and captivate the reader's imagination, even if the text itself is rather impenetrable and dizzyingly dense. A faithful stage or screen adaptation can often introduce a literary masterpiece to a wider audience, which is what Claude-Michel Schönberg's and Alain Boublil's hit musical achieved so well in the 1980s. It was one of those incredibly rare musicals like Chicago and Wicked! in which the songs were actually devoted to telling an interesting story.<br/><br/>Quite riskily, virtually every line of the piece is sung, but only occasionally does it feel excessive and laughable. If its sensitive director, Tom Hooper, had taken the easy way and pre-recorded all of that dialogue, I'm sure this cinematic adaptation would have been horribly jerky and unconvincing. His much-publicised decision to record the singing live takes the film to the other extreme. It is incredibly refreshing to hear raw, real singing coming through the surround sound and to look into the eyes of the cast and believe that its actually coming the characters mouths at that moment.<br/><br/>And what a fine cast it is. Led Australian actor-singers Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe, who occupy the most screen time and whose characters carry between them the films catalytic conflict, they are an altogether truly impressive assembly of talented luminaries and unknowns. Jackman plays the chief protagonist, Jean Valjean, a convict sentenced to 19 years of hard labour for the petty crime of stealing a loaf of bread in order to save his sick niece. Crowe plays the stalwart Inspector Javert, who sees the law as the only morality, and all its offenders as irredeemable.<br/><br/>Once Valjean is finally released, Javert and the black mark on Valjean's papers constantly prevent the penniless man from finding any work, and legally earning any income. As Jean Valjean is a poor man, a suspicious convict, a filthy gutter rat, one of the many downtrodden misérables that the film centres on. So he defiantly and proactively establishes a new identity with the help of a priest who teaches him kindness and forgiveness through demonstration. As Monsieur le maire, a wealthy businessman, he applies his insider's knowledge of the world of poverty, the priest's lessons, and a newfound trust in god, to help scores of unfortunates for the remainder of his life, even as his obsessed pursuer, Javert, who never shows any signs of learning anything from these demonstrations of mercy, as that would mean acknowledging shades of grey in his safely black-and-white world.<br/><br/>Both actors are surprisingly very convincing in their roles. Jackman has never looked so ragged and earthy, and his singing talents have never been put to better use. Crowe never reverts to his rock background during his many fine musical moments, and delivers a very compelling performance of a more internally tormented and trapped character.<br/><br/>Of the well-known supporting actors, Anne Hathaway, as the good-hearted Fantine, gives perhaps the most affectingly raw performance of the entire film. The more tortured, dishevelled, and wretched she becomes for the sake of her ailing baby daughter, Cosette, the more the often herself misused actress shows us what she's capable of. Her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream, the climax of her involvement in the film, is utterly heartbreaking and completely different to all other versions of the song, as it is acted as much as it is sung, melting our hearts with the words as much as with the notes.<br/><br/>At the other end of the scale, prolific actors Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen recapture their theatrical exuberance from Sweeney Todd as the comedic villains Mr & Mrs Thénardier, a slimy pair of costumed thieves who are, in their own way, as money-grubbing as the aristocrats who are about to meet their end in the French Revolution. It is a welcome pleasure to see these two experts doing what they do best in the moments where a bit of darkly comic relief is needed amidst the sweeping drama.<br/><br/>As the children of the street who fall prey to these two grimy, over- charging innkeepers, a host of young newcomers proudly display their fine acting and singing talents. 10-year-old Isabelle Allen is most endearing and sweet-sounding as the gentle Cosette, as is 22-year-old Samantha Barks as the noble Éponine, who quietly endures being part of a painful love triangle; but most astonishing is the 13-year-old Daniel Huttlestone as the plucky young Gavroche, the paupers' revolution's fiercest and courageous orator who forces the ignorant aristocrats to look upon the real face of the empire that mollycoddles them.<br/><br/>Gavroche proudly stands beside the young freedom-fighters of the revolution that is still incomplete as the film closes, but whose seeds have well and truly been sown. American actor Aaron Tveit is the last of the standouts as the movement's most fervent advocate. Even though Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne received billing for their respective roles as the adult Cosette and her love interest, the revolution's technical leader. Although Seyfried is a proved singer with a beautiful voice, and Redmayne isn't bad himself, their characterisations are rather bland, aside from his truly touching rendition of Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.<br/><br/>Watching this magnificent epic on screen, one wonders whether it might be even grander live on stage, with the present immediate energy of an in-the-flesh performance. However, cinema brings its own unique qualities to the piece. It enables smothering, intimate close-up, that Hooper makes good use of, and the actors are big enough to withstand. It also allows for a larger chorus, more complete set pieces, cross-cutting quartets and endless repeat viewings and showings to children and grandchildren alike far beyond the lifetimes of the cast and crew of this truly remarkable and almost flawless film."
"nkozach","8","1","2","2 January 2013"," A Faithful Adaptation to a Broadway Classic
","The musical ""Les Miserables"" is perhaps one of he greatest productions to ever be on Broadway. With that in mind, many people(myself included)were concerned about the transition to the big screen, and whether or not the movie would do justice to the musical it is based upon. Any person who has seen ""Les Miserables"" on stage can rest easy knowing that this movie very closely follows the plot of the musical, with minimal changes to the script, story, and characters. While fans of the Broadway production can enjoy the movie, newcomers to the musical sensation can easily pick up the story and follow along, without missing much of the experience. The performing by the cast is phenomenal, with each actor getting into his or her character. Hugh Jackman is amazing as Jean Valjean, and Sacha Baron Cohen is delightfully putrid as the greedy innkeeper, Thenadier. The one fault lies in Russell Crowe, who plays the role of Inspector Javer. Crowe's stellar acting is dampened by his flat and inflection-less singing, which is sad because Javert delivers a couple of truly heart wrenching songs in the Broadway show that in the movie fell flat. All in all, the movie is a worthwhile event for fans and newcomers alike."
"blanbrn","6","1","2","31 December 2012"," A musical that's a tale of hope, love and rising to oppose the rich and powerful for change!
","""Les Miserables"" is one of those musical's that is long and drawn out and kind of in depth from director Tom Hooper. And the film may not be liked by everyone as the live music action taking place on screen is much different than that of actual speaking dialogue it's like a live action musical! Anyway it has a touch of history being set in 19th century France as it involves the citizens uprising against the powerful and corrupted. Based on a Broadway play the musical performances are top notch especially the vocal work of Anne Hathaway. The story is centered around Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman) a prisoner a French convict who after years of hard labor has broken away from the grips of the tough and rugged French officer enforcer Javert(Russell Crowe), and along the way Jean will become the protector of Fantine's(Anne Hathaway) beautiful daughter. Fantine a woman who was a factory worker has turned to the world's oldest profession of selling her body to make a buck for her daughter takes a dive. So the rest of the way the surge and uprising and new revolt of citizens is lead by the ex convict Jean. Overall this film entertains as a musical and it's message of the people's uprising of revolt and fighting for freedom and rights of equality and wage rights rings true today overall a film that dreams of freedom, equal rights and human equality that equals and fights the powerful."
"andiam-1","9","1","2","29 December 2012"," Great film, but the voices could have been stronger
","On the whole, I enjoyed the film. Though I would prefer to see it on stage, it's good to realize that a lot of people who otherwise would not get to see the show will be exposed to this great music. One reason I prefer the stage play is that the violence and grime are better left to the imagination. The main problem I have with the film is the decision to cast film stars in the leads instead of talented singing actors. I know a number of opera singers who could have handled these roles more convincingly. Contrary to the opinion of several previous reviewers on this site, I did not like Anne Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream."" She over-emoted what otherwise is a beautiful song. Hugh Jackman was outstanding through most of the film, but he does not have the range for ""Bring Him Home."" And you need a real operatic voice to sing ""Stars""--my favorite song from the show--convincingly. I realize they needed name stars to recoup their investment, but some better singers would have made the film a more enjoyable experience."
"eschetic-2","8","1","2","29 December 2012"," An overwhelming experience soars above leaden direction
","This LES MIZ was largely wonderful despite astonishingly bad direction (the deft touch this director displayed in THE KING'S SPEECH has given way to the ludicrous ""tar and feather"" scene in the TV JOHN ADAMS mini-series which seems to be more his métier - relying on excessive close-ups as if it were a 1950's TV special - and he essentially destroys the ""comic"" Thénardiers. Someone really must persuade Helena Bonham Carter to play another NORMAL role some time soon; she's given this performance a few too many times). The rest of the cast however, soared above the challenges their director set them. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, the released convict who stole a loaf of bread to feed his sister's child & Eddie Redmayne as Marius, the wealthy young rebel who falls in love with Valjean's ward, Cosette, walk away with everything; both are beyond marvelous, but even Russell Crowe (the intense Inspector Javert, determined to track down Valjean) is far better than you've heard. No, he can't hit some of the notes in ""Stars"", but that *could* have been ""tweaked."" It's a real pity that it wasn't! This is NOT a filmed stage production but a fully realized (and in places abbreviated) film of a great stage work, so insisting on exclusively live performances even when the technology has improved to make that possible was, in this small case, foolish.<br/><br/>Opening at the end of the year, just before the serious Oscar races kick off, it is impossible not to consider a film's prospects on that front. Everyone's talking about Anne Hathaway's doomed Fantine (with her perennial hit song, ""I Dreamed A Dream"") because she's a ""name"" and she IS good - VERY good in the final scene - but Samantha Barks' Eponine (with her own hit song, ""On My Own"") is even better, even with a slightly truncated part! Isabelle Allen's little Cosette is the original poster child reborn, and the definitive Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson (robbed of awards for the top role in London and New York by a flashier performance credited with carrying another, lesser show), makes a fine appearance as the Bishop who redeems Valjean's soul! Ham handed direction aside, just about the only ACTOR who came up short for us - including Crowe - was a case of miscasting rather than lack of merit. Enjolras, leader of the student rebels (and the first Act Finale), NEEDS to be a figure of literally towering charisma - a young Hugh Jackman if you will. On stage, Aaron Tveit has charisma and intensity to spare, but standing next to Eddie Redmayne at the barricade, as he has to, he comes across as ""second in command."" Nevertheless, if you like the basic show, any such reservations are mere quibbles. With many sources talking about LES MISERABLES and Spielberg's LINCOLN being the prohibitive favorites for the Best Picture Oscar, it does give one pause that for the first time in MY memory, neither Oscar contender is particularly well directed - but at least LINCOLN's direction mainly fails at the start with the lame battle scene that tries to set the tone of a nation too long at war.<br/><br/>The last Oscar tie I can remember was when Streisand and Hepburn pulled it off (and well merited) for their leading roles in FUNNY GIRL and THE LION IN WINTER, but I'd really love to see three this year: LINCOLN and LES MIZ for Best Picture, Jackman and Daniel Day Lewis as Best Actor and Sally Fields and Anne Hathaway as Supporting Actress. I think LINCOLN may be close to a lock on the first two, and LES MIZ for the last, but if I had to choose ONE, I'd go with Jackman (Day-Lewis is magnificent and CONSISTENT as Lincoln, but the variety and intensity in Jackman's Valjean is astounding) and Fields (an actress I don't even *like* under normal circumstances, but making Mary Todd Lincoln not only human and understandable but sympathetic is a thing only achieved once in a lifetime).<br/><br/>I can't honestly make any observation about the new song they always feel they *have* to insert (regardless of the quality of a score) for Oscar purposes. We simply didn't notice it. If it's a good thing that it blended so well with the rest of the robust score as to pass un-noticed, it at least met that standard.<br/><br/>The audience we saw LES MIZ with on the Opening afternoon was rather fascinating as well - in part as reflection on things the film got very right. Eddie Redmayne had set the song up so well, that more than half a dozen of us unexpectedly - *I* certainly didn't see or even feel it coming! - broke out in audible sobs half a beat *before* Hugh Jackman swung into the iconic ""Bring Him Home"" (which he brings off credibly - no mean achievement) and again when he's revealing to Marius much later why he, Valjean, must go away! ...and of course, more than half the audience were wholeheartedly applauding at the end - I was amazed we weren't two or three times DURING the show. You *wanted* to, because the numbers are structured to ask for it.<br/><br/>Nice job - maybe director Hooper didn't do such an awful job after all - but if it had been as well directed as it was written and acted, LINCOLN wouldn't be anywhere near a lock on Best Picture this year. Regardless of how the Oscar races come out however, this is a fine film that any fan of the international stage success should want to savor over repeated viewings. 'Not perfect, but well worth waiting for."

Right from the start you are hit with the reality of nineteenth century post-revolutionary France where just about everyone's lives are miserable (hence the title). I applaud both Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway as they take on the two most crucial roles in my opinion perfectly. Truth be told I teared up when both Fantine and Valjean died. I went into the movie not expecting much out of Russell Crowe or Eddie Redmayne and left very surprised. Crowe because he really got into the role of the merciless cop very well and Redmayne for his role as the love-struck revolutionary. Like many others I was slightly annoyed by so many close up shots, but that was as nothing compared to the incredible performances. Even if you are not a music lover, you will appreciate the plot and intrigue surrounded by the June Revolution of 1832 as well as the comedic relief from the Thernadiers. Several parts of the movie had me wanting to sing along (though i restrained myself) and I am sure by the final 'do you hear the people sing' you will fight the urge as well."
"landinathome","9","1","2","26 December 2012"," More than just a musical
","This movie was an expansion of the musical rather than a condensation of the novel, but the musical was based on the novel, so either way it was Les Miserables. As with the musical it hit the highlights of the story in dramatic fashion. Most of the actors are not professional singers but their amazing acting ability compensated for any weakness there. It was an odd experience at first, to see actors singing their lines (with almost no dialog apart from the songs), and it took a little getting used to. At first I was thinking: I could have watched the musical in the comfort of my living-room with better singers - but I was wrong. Well, I was right about the singers, but these actors were able to bring so much more to their characters than the Broadway or London casts were able to do. The acting was superb. I did think Russell Crowe was a stand out. He had a difficult part to sing/play and did it beautifully and with powerful, yet subtle, emotion. It was a pleasure to watch his performance as Javert. Overall it was an emotional experience for all (we ranged from 12 yrs. to 62 yrs. old) and we all enjoyed it tremendously."
"Doylenf","6","3","12","9 January 2013"," Real singers badly needed to put over this epic tale of squalor and redemption...
","I have to give this a decidedly mixed review.<br/><br/>My first impression before the film's first hour was over was a silent reminder ""don't buy the soundtrack."" The singing, even from Hugh Jackman who acquitted himself so well as ""Curly"" in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ""Oklahoma!"" is, to put it charitably, just passable. Russell Crowe does as well as can be expected since he is a non-singer to begin with, but the others do not have the kind of voices that are needed to put over this kind of material.<br/><br/>Cinematically, it's a bit over-the-top with its wondrous camera views from high places. Nothing is done to suggest that the squalor isn't real. The mud is as muddy as possible and the make-up (in extreme close-ups of Anne Hathaway for example), is enough to convince us that these wretched people had nothing to sing about.<br/><br/>Not being a fan of the show and familiar with only a couple of the songs, I was not expecting to be thrilled by the score alone--and I wasn't. Whether you have an appetite for these kind of musical numbers is clearly a matter of taste. Most of the lyrics are as downbeat and desperate as the story itself suggests.<br/><br/>A much needed touch of humor is furnished by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, although some of the humor is a bit gross and overdone.<br/><br/>The almost unrecognizable first appearance of Hugh Jackman as a slave hauling a ship with his comrades as Jaffert (Russell Crowe) looks on, is an astonishing moment. Jackson looks nothing like his real self, so part of his performance can be attributed to a marvelous make-up job. But he does well with the anguish and pain of seeing so much suffering around him. Anne Hathaway is obviously a singer/actress who does all she can with the powerful emotions she displays in her big scene, but her role is a small one in the scheme of things.<br/><br/>Despite the power of some of the performances, the overall effect for me was a story that was not well told because of script problems, making it a confusing mess for anyone not familiar with the basic outline of the tale and hard to follow unless paying strict attention.<br/><br/>Your musical taste will decide whether or not you love or hate this film, but it's fair to say that the songs are not rendered in the best possible way by having them performed live. The pre-recording of all the lyrics would have enhanced the big numbers which required more vocal ability and professional technique than is offered here.<br/><br/>Summing up: Definitely not for everyone, but the squalor of the French Revolution period is magnificently realistic with lavish, detailed sets and costumes that convey the right atmosphere. Stunning photography is evident in the final scene where Crowe's conscience forces him to take drastic action.<br/><br/>Biggest flaw: The lack of tension in the cat-and-mouse game between Crowe and Jackman that was so powerfully portrayed in straight dramatic versions of the story filmed previously which sharpened the suspense. Instead, Crowe's recognition of the hunted man is done so casually that there is no building of suspense from the outset."

I think this was my happiest moment of Les Misérables. This year I was convinced that hugely invested money on movies is well received by Oscar voters even of the movie lacks talent and quality.

If you do not know what I wrote before, please navigate away, it's clear what's on your mind, do not know what you are looking for reviews of films on the internet when your purpose and meaning in life is perpetuation of the species.<br/><br/>Directed: I appreciated the theater feeling that one wants to convey. Overall a total fiasco: actors seem disconcerting, scared, more attentive to indications coming from soufflés perched on stairs than emotions transmission. Tom Hooper try something, but it's clear that he does not know or trying to prove the fact and leaves a mess tedious and boring. If you want an example of how to put on film a play, look at Carnage. Yes you can, but you must have with you, bro. Hooper Polanski did not ...<br/><br/>Scenario: stupid. A confused, the name of Manţog saying that maybe this film would make people who will watch will read the book. A stupid idea, written just to fill an empty space in a weak review. The film has little to do with the true story of the book. And over, who read the book know what the hell I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Dialogues: la la la la la la la la trilulululu trilalala rilu rilu to. Dialogues? Somewhere or be one myself I could not follow. I do not know if because actors whose painful grimace leads me to implacability a violent vomiting which rises from the stomach into the throat or lyric musicality was not felt. Dialogues or be, but I for one, have not heard. Why people lose time with musicals instead of going to the opera anyway? There are so many fascinating areas worth listening which are immortal,<br/><br/>I do not understand why should I be a masochist and listen how Hackman and Crowe bubble.<br/><br/>Characters: Les Miserables - Victor Hugo. Further no comment.<br/><br/>Actors: however I'm a fan Russell Crowe or Wolverine (Gene Hackman) and Anne Hathaway (who even manages something here unlike the rest) and Sacha Baron Cohen (which is ridiculous), Helena Bonham Carter (which I did not understand) and Amanda Seyfried (who's blonde ... and so), I prefer to forget this film as fast as possible. One who managed to do something in this film is Anne Hathaway and shw was was saved by her voice and talent. A good actor must know when to turn down a role, even if the director recently won an Oscar.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: supposedly the whole movie is a soundtrack. Who heard it to and buy it.<br/><br/>Impact: destroyer of pop-opera bodybuilders which is just noise and did not know the book by Victor Hugo. The film is catchy Bone-tone and snobbish.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I can not believe I'm saying this, but this movie is worse than Zero Dark Thirty. My friendly advice is if you have a choice between these two films, go to zero, even there you'll get bored but at least you learn you learn some contemporary history. American Mania for musicals I believe is the only thing that can explain this stupidity Oscar nomination. Movie rating: 4, 3 points because of Anne Hathaway, one is in office."

","""Les Miserables"" is a feast for the eyes, but PB&J for the ears. The acting is A+, but the total voices barely C-. This movies looks wonderful, locations, sets, art production, costumes. Lavish and splendid or grungy and threadbare as needed for the characters, and well acted throughout. <br/><br/>But Les Mis is a musical and the voices should count. Jackman and Crowe are the most disappointing. They carry show -- or should. A recent article had Jackman's movie vocal coach boasting that she had helped him extend his range four notes higher than he'd reached before. Trouble is, you can no more expand a person's vocal range than I could go from being 5'4"" to 6'. That's why Bring Him Home is so ""forceful."" Since Hooper seemingly wanted the songs done in their original keys, Jackman has to sing above his range, since he's not a true tenor. That's why his voice cracks, why it's strained and why he can't go from soft to loud and back on the same breath. It's everything he can do to get those higher notes out. As for Russell... other reviewers here have discussed him, so I won't. <br/><br/>Samantha Barks is wonderful, but then she's sung on the West End. Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit have fine voices. Otoh, SBC and HBC's voices are as bad as their characters. For many movie goers, as long as they can SEE the movie, all the problems barely register. The acting and look carry Hugo's wonderful story and the movie along. For many the DVD will be enough, but I don't think the soundtrack will do very well. When people begin to really listen, they might ask why Universal didn't look first for great singers who can act, instead of name actors who sometimes sing."
"nicked2101","4","2","7","18 January 2013"," Desperately disappointing
","As a huge fan of the stage production, I had high hopes for the film. What looked, on paper at least, to be an excellent cast added to my sense of expectation as I entered the cinema. That is where the problems started.<br/><br/>Whatever Hugh Jackman is, and wherever his skill lie, it is certainly not in musicals. His voice has nowhere near the required power to carry the role of Jean Valjean. He struggles to hit notes repeatedly, and whilst he certainly looked the part, his singing was some way short of average.<br/><br/>If only Russell Crowe could reach the dizzying heights of ""some way short of average"". Sorry, but he has been woefully miscast. Not just for the role of Javert, but the fact that he is required to sing. For two of the leading roles to fall so far short of the required singing ability is completely unacceptable. It would have been far better to have cast any two of the numerous outstanding stage actors who have played the parts so well at the West End - it is not as if people were flocking to the film specifically because Jackman and Crowe were in it.<br/><br/>There were some outstanding performances. Anne Hathaway in particular was outstanding - a brilliant performance that will undoubtedly win her an Oscar, and deservedly so. Samantha Barks as Eponine and Eddie Redmayne as Marius were also excellent, and the Sacha Baron Cohen / Helena Bonham Carter duo as the Innkeeper and his wife brought obvious talent and humour to their roles.<br/><br/>The costume and production were very good, and again got deserved Oscar nominations, but they were not enough to save a film that should have been one of the all time greats. I would go as far as to say that it is the most disappointing cinema experience of my life."

","I have not read Victor Hugo's novel, nor seen the stage version of Les Miserables, nor have I participated in it as a musician or actor. I don't have that frame of reference for my review--only the movie. Winners: 1) Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman--I think the criticism of their singing is unwarranted. I felt like their acting chops shined here. Jury's out: 1) Production values--no dubbing of the singers--the singing was presented, warts and all. On the other hand, the scenery and costumes was spectacular, even if the ""greenscreen"" at the end where the guard jumps to his death was all too obvious. 2) Victor Hugo--I have to wonder how he'd react to this spectacle. Losers: 1)Sasha Baron Cohen--yo, Sasha baby! Stick to broad comedies where YOU are the star. That way I can avoid seeing you for all time. What a horrible choice for this movie. 2)Kid with a Cockney Accent--if he can be coached to speak like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins, he can be coached to speak like a French child--or better yet, CAST a French child. 3) Female leads singing--sorry, it was pretty bad. I'm a big fan of Anne Hathaway, so I'm glad that this wasn't the first movie in which I saw her. See the first ""Princess Diaries"" when she's in her convertible singing in the pouring rain. Yo, Amanda! Singing a through-sung Broadway score is a LITTLE different than performing a jukebox musical (Mamma Mia)--even though you had the look for the part, your vocal chops weren't up to the task. 4) Too many closeups!<br/><br/>I'm sure people will think it's a good date movie, and maybe for theater geeks, it will be. Time to go to the library and check out the book."

","I caught a rerun of Les Miserables, the Movie, on cable the other night. I had forgotten how truly awful it is. Miscast and overproduced, it lacked all the passion of the stage production, which I'd seen four times (including the original New York cast). Hugh Jackman is a great musical theater performer, but Jean Valjean isn't his best role - physically or vocally. Non-singer Russell Crowe had no business being cast in the role of Javert, but was undoubtedly hired for his marquee value. Anne Hathaway is living proof that anyone can win an Academy Award if you spend enough time, money and energy campaigning for it. And Sasha Baron Cohen was just playing himself, without the necessary comic relief.<br/><br/>It's hard to translate an imaginative theatrical work to the realism of film. Less is more. On stage, Les Mis created a world and lifetime with suggestive moving set pieces. The real streets and barricades in the film are something of a letdown.<br/><br/>Les Mis is operatic in score and structure. You need bigger than life voices. You need passion and intensity. Most of all, you need imagination. This film had none of those things. It's lifeless."

","This is without doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.
It's like someone have made a list of the top 50 things I do not like about movies and then create a script around it.
If this movie was a cocktail then it would only have been made from things I did not like. <br/><br/>The nastiest food in a blender and diluted with so much water that it took over two and a half hours to drink it.<br/><br/>In addition they gave me a pizza with a very good tomato sauce but a chewy old dough but it is only occupied with my favorite ingredients and that makes the taste even worse, And the cheese is sandy. If I did not know better I would think the film exists solely and solely to annoy me.<br/><br/>No spice in the world can improve the taste, a movie that got so much attention because it's world literature.
However, I can say little positive about the book and the fact that almost only actors I like (and with which I would like to shoot myself) offend me to such an inward depth way.<br/><br/>With all the imagery, the music and all the content I can really say that is the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. (The movie equivalent to an insult.)
The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that I now have a scale of bad movies and can always compare for the rest of my life for the very bottom drawer."
"caseymoviemania","4","2","8","13 January 2013"," Casey's Movie Mania: LES MISERABLES (2012)
","By now, if you are a movie fan, you should have heard all the positive buzzes surrounding Anne Hathaway's pitch-perfect performance as the doomed Fantine in Tom Hooper's big screen version of Victor Hugo's massive novel, LES MISERABLES and of course its long-running 1980 Broadway musical. Her particularly vocal rendition of I Dreamed a Dream, which is filmed in a bravura single take, has single-handedly moved (many) critics and viewers to tears. After finally watching this movie, I must admit I was moved by Hathaway's heartbreaking role and I can't believe she actually sings very well. No doubt she is truly deserved to garner an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress (and I really hope she can win the award as well).<br/><br/>As for director Tom Hooper who is fresh off from his multiple Oscar win in 2010's THE KING SPEECH, has approached LES MISERABLES with a risky but bravura decision of shooting all of his actors singing live rather than lip-synching to pre-recorded playback often seen in Hollywood musicals. It's an exceptional novelty and added to the heartfelt, first half hour of the movie, LES MISERABLES looks very certain of becoming another clear winner for Tom Hooper. In fact, at the time of this writing, the movie has scored 8 Academy Awards nomination including Best Picture and Best Actor (Hugh Jackman). Unfortunately, this 158 minutes musical epic is strangely hollow for much of its running time.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, the opening first half hour looks promising enough. It begins with hundreds of convicts being ordered to drag the ship into the dock by using ropes. One of the convicts are Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who is pulling the rope at all his might. Then he is ordered by the sadistic warden, Javert (Russell Crowe) to lift a heavy pole that carries a French flag. Valjean manages to do so as he demonstrates such incredible strength.<br/><br/>After Valjean is finally released from prison under a parole, he proceeds to find a job but unable to secure any work because of his status as an ex-convict. As he is unable to find a place to sleep and eat, he is eventually lucky enough to meet a bishop (Colm Wilkinson) who is kind enough to provide him good hospitality. However, later that night, Valjean wakes up from the bed and steals a couple of silverware. He flees, but gradually being apprehended by the local police. He is brought back to the bishop but the bishop claims that he actually given him the silverware and further proves his innocence by handling him two silver candlesticks. In return for his freedom, Valjean swears to become a changed man.<br/><br/>Years has passed, and Valjean is now taking on the new identity as Monsieur Madeleine, a mayor and a factory owner. He meets a lowly factory worker named Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who gets fired when it is discovered she has an illegitimate child named Cosette (Isabelle Allen). Meanwhile, he crosses path with Javert again, who immediately recognizes him as the ex-convict he once knew before.<br/><br/>As Fantine struggles to make ends meet by turning herself into prostitution, she is eventually falling very ill. Valjean feels pity for her and promises to care for her daughter Cosette like his own child before Fantine's eventual death.<br/><br/>So far, so good. But by the time Fantine is out of the picture, the rest of the two hours' running time fails to match the intensity of what has come before, particularly when Hathaway sings her heart out so emotionally devastating in I Dreamed a Dream.<br/><br/>The biggest problem of this movie is Tom Hooper himself. Yes, the visual re-creation of the 19th-century Paris is stunning and while Hooper's decision to film all the actors' singing performances as much closeups as he can to proof that they are indeed singing live has that certain intimate quality, too much of everything can be seriously devastating. And that's what Hooper has made a huge mistake here. For all the lavish production values provided here, this movie feels too stagy to qualify as a cinematic movie musical. In fact, there are just too many closeup shots to the point of nausea.<br/><br/>William Nicholson's adapted screenplay feels stuffy and of course, heavy-handed. Apart from Hathaway's winning performance, the rest of the actors pale by comparison. Hugh Jackman is quite decent as the struggling Jean Valjean. He certainly can sing as well, but I'm not convinced enough he actually deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Actor because frankly, his performance is uneven. Russell Crowe, who is always impressive as a dramatic actor, looks hopelessly out of touch playing the role of Javert. Although he also part-time as a singer headlining a longtime band called 30 Odd Foot of Grunts in real life, his singing performance comes across as shallow and off-key. Not only that, he also looks too stiff and dare I say, boring. As the adult Cosette, Amanda Seyfried's performance is sadly forgettable, while Eddie Redmayne is fairly adequate as the rebel student, Marius. Newcomer Samantha Barks has a few minor moments for herself playing the doomed Eponine who had a crush with Marius. Her vocal renditions are also exceptionally top-notch. Finally, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, are adequately cast as two cunning innkeepers. At least they are good performing necessary comic relief (their duet in Master of the House is particularly quirky) in this otherwise morose production.<br/><br/>No doubt there are a few worthwhile songs here and there. But to sum this as an overall effort, LES MISERABLES remains a huge disappointment especially given all the massive hype and most of the highly-acclaimed talents involved here."
"Hello-Beautiful","9","2","9","23 March 2013"," Creative parallel to the Original
","Delicious performances you can fall in love with, beautiful idiosyncrasies abound, creative cinematography & the heartfelt warmth of live performances ... it's hard not to love it.<br/><br/>There might be the obvious objection to this film from those who dislike musicals, but I have to admit, I usually don't enjoy them myself & this is a work of art that I think most can appreciate. Most musicals start slowly, but the pace of Les Misrables is perfection. This more musical adaptation really is a beautiful parallel to the '98 Liam Neeson version & Jean Valjean was played fairly well by Jackman overall.<br/><br/>There are immediate feelings of religious overcast in the first few minutes of the film; particularly when Jean Valjean is a slave forced to carry the top of a flag mast (metaphorically showing the burden of Christ.) This overtone actually brings semblance to the film overall & is true to the original idea, so no one should take offense.<br/><br/>The real genius is found all in Hooper's directing & the genuine characters though. I'm still blown away that this film crammed Crowe, Jackman, Hathaway, Bonam-Carter in one delicious albeit whimsical performance.<br/><br/>The most mesmerizing performances definitely are won by Hathaway & Crowe by far. The small spotlight of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" being sang by disheveled Hathaway was INSANE & Crowe was masterful as Javert throughout. It's an extra little treat to see Daniel Huttlestone & Isabelle Allen (the children of the cast) take the stage & make it just that much cuter with their young & spirited performances.<br/><br/>If you're not sure what I mean about 'idiosyncrasies' then you should take note that Sacha Baron Cohen (Yes, the one from Borat) actually plays a mostly serious role & is paired with Bonham-Carter.<br/><br/>The one change I would make would be to switch the more passionate actor Aaron Tveit (Marius) for Eddie Redmayne's character Enjolras. Tveit, in my eyes, is clearly sexier & I felt immediately that Tveit would have played a better lover to Cosette. Redmanyne seems more like side-kick material to me. They did both play the idealistic revolutionaries well though, so I'm sure most audience members didn't care as much.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd recommend this to those seeking a unique experience that you won't find in cinema everyday or even every year. Les Miserables deserved more Oscar-attention."

It's not a knock on the actors in this production, it's just that their voices can not compare to trained singers. Valjean demands a tenors voice, just as Javert a voice must be a baritone, and Fantine, a mezzo soprano. Do your self a favor and see this live on Broadway or at one of the traveling shows.

So eventually when I had time and felt like watching a musical I decided to review this movie based on the great play based on Victor Hugo's novel in the hopes that the magic that I witnessed in London's West End could be transported to the medium of cinema for all to marvel at. By the end of the movie I thought to myself ""I should have just re-watched Sweeney Todd"". <br/><br/>As always lets start with the good things in this movie, first off the acting for the most part is great. It's not easy to transfer a stage show to the cinema and use the actors to the same effect. On stage the characters have to be exaggerated and stylised as does the singing. In the movies this doesn't tend to work so well as it just looks like horrible over-acting, which does actually happen in a couple of scenes here. However, the majority of the characters are believable and interesting with the majority of delicate, heartfelt scenes coming off well. The film's costume design is also very commendable and adds a very strong air of authenticity to the film. <br/><br/>So what reasons do I have for giving this film a 5? It's horribly filmed, the live singing was a poor decision, the story is f***ing stupid and despite it being nearly 3 hours long it has more corner cutting than a paper snowflake. The shaky-cam style of filming really doesn't work here and it's very clearly demonstrated in the scenes where any of the characters have to show a bit of energy. Furthermore, even during action scenes the camera is zoomed so far in on the characters faces that I'm surprised that their breath isn't fogging up the lens. I get that this works for sad or dramatic scenes but not through out the whole bloody film. The live singing is uneven and some of it is just really poor. Imagine hearing a beautiful rendition of I Dreamed a Dream by Anne Hathaway, full of emotion and soul that nearly brings you to tears. Then imagine Russell Crowe trying to belt out a lesser song without putting in much discernible effort or acting like he's trying to act like he gives a s*** about where he is or what he's doing. In terms of story, I'm not going to say too much as I don't like giving spoilers but let me just say it's the kind of thing you might see in a low budgeted sequel of a bad Disney film. Finally, the whole jump cut style thing with time cards is stupid. They sacrificed so much character development by just showing time cards saying ""9 years later"" and then suddenly one of the characters has made a huge transformation. If they maybe cut some of the scenes featuring Sacha Baron-Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter who add nothing to the plot line after their first scene then maybe they could have fit it in and made the story more interesting and believable. <br/><br/>So in the end this movie gets a 5 out of 10. It's biggest crime for me being that when I later watched a stage recording of the show that I bought a week later to wash the taste of this garbage from my mouth, I began to think that I was giving this show more credit than it actually deserved. That's what this movie did. So do as I do and forget that this movie ever happened. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading this review, if you found it helpful please feel free to check out my other reviews."

","Please take this advice before viewing the turgid nonsense that is Les Miserables. This effort makes Miss Saigon look like the wackiest comedy ever. I have honestly never seen such a depressing sight since my last tax demand. Hopefully everyone concerned with this production was offered counselling. By the time Javert decided to end it all by jumping into the swirling waters, I was on my feet ready to push him. Director Tom Hooper should have told young Daniel Huttlestone ( Gavroche ) that he was no longer playing a part in ""Oliver."" His cockney accent in the middle of Paris was ridiculous. "" Stone the Russell Crowes guv. You wouldn't Adam and Eve it"" Hope anyone who viewed this in the cinema went on Orange Wednesday 2 for 1. At least this would be a small compensation."

I simply never cry at movies, but throughout large chunks of this one, I was on the verge of tears.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it does have a couple of mitigating factors which predestine me to look favourably on it - a nostalgic glow from my childhood memories of the songs, and the fact that it seems to me an openly theistic film - and yes, director Tom Hooper uses every trick in the book to pull at the heart-strings.<br/><br/>However, there is no denying the strength (and bleakness) of the story, the strength of the cast who all sing and act out of their skins. With the exception of slight accent troubles with one or two characters, the film absolutely excels in every single area, achieving near-perfection in the field of cinema.<br/><br/>For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk"
"schgreen","1","1","3","1 June 2013"," Complete rubbish
","I have just sat through this with my family and I am absolutely flabbergasted that anyone could consider this a great musical film. It has a maximum of 3 songs with tunes, and that is being generous, and only 2 members of the cast could actually sing, and not very memorably. To me, it was the equivalent of watching a very amateur group perform an opera that consisted almost entirely of badly sung recitative. I have never seen the stage version, but I presume it is better than this, although that wouldn't be very hard to accomplish. Surely a musical must live or die based on the songs, and whether or not you leave the experience with a number of them in your head. For me, this had one tune, the "" I dreamed a dream"" song popularised by Susan Boyle, and I challenge anyone to hum anything else after watching this. Dire."
"peter-ferjancic","6","1","3","18 April 2013"," Both fantastic and fantastically bad.
","The problem with this movie is that it has excellent moments in a general sea of mediocricity and boredom. At the end it depends how quickly you are drained by the bad parts.<br/><br/>Let me be a bit more clear. Anne Hathaway got an Oscar for her role and you will see why. ""I dreamed a dream"" is a legendary piece that will be remembered for a long time. Unfortunately it's about four minutes long in a movie that clocks a total of 158. There is still Hugh Jackman that does a great job in both acting and singing and, unlike some reviewers, me and my non-existent musical ear found Russel Crove to be quite entertaining.<br/><br/>That's about it. The rest is fairly needless ""singing"" of pretty much everything which would include ""we're oooout of tooooilet paaaper"" (sing it in the ""look down"" rhythm for dramatic effect). While not bad in itself it streches the scenes and stops the plot in a grindhalt. Seeing the movie at home i just started skipping scenes toward the end and I didn't feel like i missed anything. That says a lot.<br/><br/>Basically if you find repetitive recitation of dialogue appealing this movie is for you, otherwise you may skip it and watch the ""i dreamed a dream"" scene on youtube."

","I almost did not see this outstanding film due to the critics reviews, as well as personal experience with stage to film adaptations. I tried to watch ""Phantom of the Opera"" but had seen the original stage production and nothing could compare.<br/><br/>The major criticism of Les Miz, seems to center around the idea that great actors should transform into opera singers, or vice versa.<br/><br/>It appears to me Director Tom Hooper chose to focus on Victory Hugo's 150 year old, multi-layered story (one of the best novels of the 19th century) rather than attempt to imitate one of the all time greatest stage shows. It was a brilliant decision. <br/><br/>A big budget film with extremely complex characters, demands a strong cast that will deliver on performance vital to the storyline, as well as appeal to a broad audience. <br/><br/>Mr. Hooper delivers magnificently using a method not seen before; He opted for strong, leading actors such as Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway, in the most significant roles. Rather than mime to prerecorded songs (the norm) they sing their entire performance. The fact that he chose a cast able to do both simultaneously, is an amazing feat and fascinating to watch. Undoubtedly some vocals are better than others, however those with smaller roles tend to have the most singing talent. Samantha Barks in her first film, is a perfect example of this. She delivers a phenomenal performance in her short screen time. <br/><br/>It is my opinion, unlike live stage shows, this format allows us to see the many dimensions of each character. Inspector Javert, came though much more authentically due to the ability and talent of Russell Crowe. (authentic to the story) My guess is that this film will suddenly inspire more interest in the history of France. On the big screen we can better envision the scope and magnitude of living and working conditions during this era.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is, undeniably excellent playing the lead as ""Valjean"". I was quite moved by his performance in every way. <br/><br/>Equally crucial to the storyline, Russell Crowe as ""Inspector Javert"" is receiving criticism. I thought he brought a great deal to a complex multi-dimensional role. (on stage this has not been done-to my knowledge) Granted he does not have a huge vocal range, but his acting range is superb and he does sing well! His baritone voice is perfect for the dark and menacing Javert. He delivers excellent performance singing Stars as well as his final scene. (no spoilers!) <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway has been given all the praise already so I will limit myself here, other than to say I also thought she was great!<br/><br/>The entire cast is incredibly talented and give outstanding performances. I purchased the DVD and watched several times already, each viewing I take a little more away from it. <br/><br/>In this era when Hollywood is giving us so little of quality to choose from and cutting films to 90 minutes, this 3 hours of pure talent and great storytelling is a treasure! Give this a try if you have not seen it, you will not be disappointed! Unless of course you don't like musicals. IMO - this will become one of ""those""...destined to become a classic! Easy 10 stars!"
"axel-koch","6","1","3","1 April 2013"," 1st chapter - meh, 2nd chapter - fantastic, 3rd chapter - get me out of this theater!
","Maybe I think like this because my local cinema didn't pause the movie, but this was just so tedious. While the intro of the movie was a rather weak debut, the second chapter was ceaselessly sublime and full with great, rememberable scenes. Anne Hathaway's performance was perfect, but sadly this can't be said about the bigger part of the others. While Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen added admirably funny touch the movie, I was quite disappointed with the rest of the cast. Yes, they were all good, but it's just not what I expected from such a big production. Hugh Jackmann did a great job most of the times, but I think his turn in this movie is overrated. The singing was also not as good as I expected it to be. <br/><br/>So much about the acting. A big plus point of the film is how it looks. Cinematography, make-up, costumes, set design, etc. are all quite Oscar- worthy. So the only major problem of mine with 'Les Miz' was the exhausting length. I admit that I've seen neither a stage performance nor an other movie based on Victor Hugo's novel in all my life - therefore I was a total newbie to the story - therefore I can't agree with the people that have read/seen 'Les Misérables' before and consider it a too short adaption of the story because the 158 minutes of this movie were already much too long for me.<br/><br/>But let's go back to the point where I was actually loving the movie, which is about the first hour and 15 minutes. After this second chapter was over and time fast-forwarded once again, the entertainment factor got lost in the skipped years. The revolution and the film's big love story are the new plot-points and that was far less interesting as the story of the films 2nd part. I admit, it was made totally fine, but it was just missing something to jazz it up (Anne Hathaway probably would've helped).<br/><br/>All in all, if you haven't seen any form of the story before like I did, you'll be better off getting the movie on home media so you can take a big break at some point - you'll need that."

","I just recently rented this movie, I know it won a lot of awards and in some cases it was awesome acting but I don't understand it. I thought there would be a little singing here and there but they sang the entire movie. I am really confused about Anne Hathaway storyline. You never get an answer as to who they are or what happened or what or why we care about these people. I didn't care for this movie in fact I had to walk out of the room a few times because I got bored with the constant singing. I can't ever tell you how the movie ended because I had to stop to return it back. This movie was just not for me, but maybe someone out there likes that kind of movie."

","Les Miserables is a one of a kind.<br/><br/>Best thing about the film (apart from the music) is the Acting. It's absolutely brilliant with a fantastic performance by Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway. Singing was spot on.<br/><br/>The film though feels a bit rushed. When the emotional scenes kick in, you don't really feel the emotion (unless you are a bit lighthearted). The action is also fairly average. I just think that another director who suits this genre would of done a better job. The film was also INSANELY hyped. It is a great film but it is far from being a classic.<br/><br/>Apart from the things said above, it is a great film with outstanding acting and beautiful music.<br/><br/>See it."
"larryssa-68-866888","5","1","3","25 February 2013"," well... when call call it miserables!
","I""m french, i knew the story even before i read the books, i later heard the french musical and i recognize in this movie some of the musical themes (but so few). All that to say that my opinion could have been compromised. But I also love cinema, and i can separate and analyze to forge an opinion, leaving my background behind myself.<br/><br/>But what is this?? This version lacks of every single drop of the original characters, scenes, themes developed... I hardly recognized the speech because it is so empty: this movie in a huge void filed with some acting and songs. Even the cast seems poor and i normally love the actors/actress. The only one that i can't really stand normally (anna Hathaway) is actually the one giving her best, and Javert Crowe seems to save both the original songs and the strong believes of the inspector but appears to be half-in half-out of his performance. <br/><br/>They could have had something great, but it is just an empty shell, a long one not well managed in duration, film making, and shooting. Take the opening scene: OK with quickly learn who is who and why... but what does it mean about the characters and their environment? Just their emptiness before they find their goals in life? Well, the shooting seems to go in that direction. And the close-ups in each songs, what are they supposed to mean? Proximity, extreme feelings? That's not the point: we have to see those miserables and the film gave them up by the filthy decorum and it's just too much. OK it's staged, it's a musical but it's not a cynical comedy as it looks like here...<br/><br/>I'm still glad to have seen it because i can judge and now i really want to go back to the books and some french adaptations. But why Hollywood (and cie) always seems to look for the tragic, exaggerating the drama by some powerful (but just awful) voices and music, some sad eyes, and poor dialog's???? a good story suffices by itself, a great one survives and lasts in memories and does not need to be act upon!!<br/><br/>Just try another recipe at some point, just make cinema with reason and eyes, not only with a strong heart and bad influences..."
"theredraylives","9","1","3","7 February 2013"," Hugh Jackman is masterful
","Les Misérables is, at once, one of the most engrossing, emotionally realized, and overwhelming theatrical experiences of the last decade. Many parts of it are so grandiose and spectacular that few words exist to describe how memorable they are; others are baffling and confusing. Still others are almost horrid mistakes. Its complexities and intricacies are many, but in the end, Les Mis stands as a fantastically beautiful film that should have been the best picture of the year.<br/><br/>The film's primary (and most engaging) narrative is the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), prisoner 24601, recently paroled after nineteen years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread. After his parole, his treatment and exclusion almost forces him to be a criminal in order to survive, leading him to steal silver from a church. Rather than condemn him, the priest instead takes pity on Valjean and gives him the silver, on the condition that he use it to become an honest man. Horrified by how low he had sunk and touched by this gesture, Valjean resolves to become just that.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman deserves to win best actor at this year's Academy Awards for this role. He is absolutely amazing as the tormented Jean Valjean, even after he skips out on parole and is living a good life he is still on the run, still afraid, bitter, angry, and uncaring. Jackman infuses all of these layers into his performance, creating a character that is utterly captivating. His voice is equally amazing, his singing digging deep to the core of the character. His evolution from selfish to selfless, and his redemption for his crimes, all brought to life effortlessly by Jackman's brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Equally moving is Russell Crowe as Inspector Javert, an inspired bit of casting on the part of Tom Hooper, which has drawn some ire from some circles but is a tremendous success. Though clearly not as musically inclined as the castmates around him, Crowe plays Javert's dedication to finding the escaped 24601 with zeal and hunger. He vanishes into the role and is effortless, and gives a performance that was sadly overlooked this awards season. His Inspector is firm, cold, and unforgiving, and played wonderfully so.<br/><br/>Hooper does a fantastic job blending the need for strong performances with the emotional singing, not content to just let one side or the other do the job. With such wonderful music, it could have been easy to allow it to elicit the emotion, but many of the performers blend it seamlessly with deep, visceral performances that complement each other beautifully.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway will almost certainly walk away with an Oscar for best supporting actress for her portrayal of Fantine. While this is a truly great performance, the film nearly falls apart during her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" for a few reasons. Hooper pushes the camera in close, allowing all of Fantine's raw despair and anguish to pour from the screen. She has a fantastic voice, but frankly Hathaway mugs the camera during the song, and she goes a little bit overboard in her performance toward the end- she is utterly perfect through most of it. More than this, the scene demands such emotional investment (between the performance, the close-up, and the song itself) that it becomes almost overwhelming. The film takes some time before it returns to the level of emotion displayed here, leading to a kind of slump that drags through the film. It's as if this were the complete focus of all of Hooper's efforts, and it feels too much like awards bait.<br/><br/>Nine years later, the film truly hits its stride as the tides of revolution wash in; the microcosm that was Valjean's treatment early in the film becomes the experience of all the poor in France. Éponine (Samantha Barks) is grown up and is desperately in love with Marius (Eddie Redmayne), but he is oblivious to this fact. Compound that with the fact that he and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) fall madly in love with one another from the moment they see one another, and that Marius is swept up in the struggle for freedom alongside Enjolras (Aaron Tveit). For the final ninety minutes, the film builds and builds to a magnificent climax, both in plot and in its characterizations. Redmayne in particular gives an astounding performance as Marius, especially with his brilliant rendition of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" Mind-blowing isn't apt enough a description.<br/><br/>Inevitably, Les Misérables has so many amazing moments it would be nearly impossible to recount them all. It is a film that demands multiple viewings. The music is brilliant, the voices singing it crafting each note with heart-wrenching honesty and emotion. That Tom Hooper, fresh off his win for his amazing work in The King's Speech, was ignored for a nomination for best director at the Oscars is criminal (despite it being a very crowded category).<br/><br/>It should have been the best picture of the year- in many ways, it is. Yet its pacing and length detract from what would have otherwise been a masterpiece of an offering. Too much screen time is wasted on the Thénardiers, between Helena Bonham Carter's wardrobe and Sacha Baron Cohen's ridiculous French accent (the only one in a film set in France). Still, from the moment Enjolras begins singing ""Do you Hear the People Sing?"" the film's pace thunders forward, finally re-capturing the emotional wave that had roared in when Hathaway belted out the film's most recognizable tune. It is a shame that wave too long receded, and that Hathaway's is the most talked-about performance in the film. From the very beginning to the end, this film belongs to Hugh Jackman, and his is the kind of performance that absolutely transforms a great work into something spectacular.<br/><br/>Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!"
"lasttimeisaw","6","1","3","6 February 2013"," Les Miserables
","A full-house weekend cinema viewing, maybe a second-row syndrome which left my anticipation unfulfilled. First of all, I never successfully accustomed to the ""all sung script""bravura which blatantly dissolved the narrative into a mess of inconsistent singing ballyhoo, yes, I aware it is a musical film, but the semi-sing,semi-speak preposterousness is so distracting as if we were watching aliens perform their own performing art, a dreadful insouciant nonchalance has penetrated from the beginning to the very end. <br/><br/>Secondly, the singing expertise from the cast is uneven, I don't intend to name the black sheep here, just wonder what's the advantage of adapting a musical into a feature film if the latter's voice prowess cannot keep in the same level albeit putting money to create more detailed settings instead of simple tableaux on the stage. There must be some artistic reasons behind but for the profitable perspective with exponentially-surging attendance. I may opt for a stage musical against my film aficionado predilection. <br/><br/>Special congratulations to Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks, their solo renditions alone are worth the ticket (maybe a soundtrack is more felicitous), Hathaway will 99% sure win her first Oscar, and she should perform in the upcoming Grammy awards as well. Barks is a new- found gem, but whether or not she can leap into a stardom out of the genre is a moot. Hugh Jackman finally gets his hard-earned Oscar nomination, but impaired by the sketchy and episodic storytelling, it is far from an award-worthy leading performance. Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried are adequate, while Helena and Sacha pair engenders a Burton-esque high spirit to offset the dreary misery and wide-eyed revolutionist mirage. <br/><br/>Fairly speaking, Tom Hooper's workmanship doesn't generate too much excitement, starts with his shaky camera, eerie and undetermined, the CGI surroundings can hardly be called innovative, as an Oscar-winning director, his unjust fluke will sooner or later boomerang on his own luck.<br/><br/>Sorry for grudging all over the place, I am pining for some involving lifelike revelations, clearly I am pigeonholing myself into the wrong consumer coterie, or simply don't watch it in the second row."
"agmoldham","5","1","3","1 February 2013"," A little bit long
","Must confess that I was a little bit disappointed wit Les Miserables after seeing plenty of hype about the film. As with most films that you are ambivalent towards that is mainly because I never really engaged with the main characters.<br/><br/>The film has an excellent cast and tells the story of Cosette, a girl brought up during the French revolution. The entire film is sung with varying degrees of professionalism by the main actors. Russel Crowe is a fine actor, but a fairly average singer and the same is also true of Hugh Jackman. That's a fairly minor gripe though as you soon ignore the quality of the singing and focus on the plot. <br/><br/>I felt that parts of the film should have been more emotional than they were. Quite sure that many other people will get very emotional watching the film and will really enjoy it. I just wasn't one of them."

","From director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech), 2010 saw the famous stage musical, based on the novel by Victor Hugo, celebrate its 25th anniversary of production, I had never seen it before, and there have been a number of film adaptations before, I was very much looking forward to this latest incarnation with a great ensemble cast. Basically, set in 1815, convict Jean Valjean (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Hugh Jackman) has served nineteen years in prison and is released on parole by prison guard Javert (Russell Crowe), Bishop of Digne (Colm Wilkinson) offers him food and shelter, but he leaves during the night with stolen silverware. The authorities catch him, but the forgiving Bishop says the silverware was a gift, touched by the love, grace and generosity he begins an honest life under a new identity, Javert swears to bring him to justice for breaking parole. Eight years pass, Valjean is mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer and owner of a factory, and there works poor Fantine (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Anne Hathaway), and being dismissed by the foreman (Michael Jibson) she is forced into prostitution to make the money she needs for her illegitimate young daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen). Arguing with a customer she is arrested by Javert, now a police Inspector, but is rescued by Valjean, and while she is in hospital he finds out that a man thought to be him has been arrested, he confesses his true identity to the court before a sentence is made. Fantine close to death is promised by him that he will take care of her daughter, and after duelling with Javert, who recognises him, he finds Cosette living with deceitful and uncaring Thénardier (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Madame Thénardier (Helena Bonham Carter), he pays them to take her and be a father to her. Nine year pass, the only sympathetic government official toward the poor Jean Maximilien Lamarque is dying, and students Marius Pontmercy (My Week with Marilyn's Eddie Redmayne) and Enjolras (Aaron Tveit), as well as street urchin Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone) are trying to bring together other students to stand against the constabulary. Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) is now a young woman, and catching a glimpse of her Marius has fallen instantly in love, she meanwhile is not getting answers from Valjean about Fantine or his past. After the death of Lamarque Enjolras has organised a group of idealistic students, while Marius's friend Éponine (Samantha Barks) leads him to Cosette so that they can declare their, but Éponine has a secret love for him that cannot be returned, so she joins the revolution. Mistaking a robbery in their house for Javert discovering them, Valjean tells his daughter they must flee, and the Parisians have rallied with Enjolras to revolt, Cosette writes a farewell letter to Marius. The following day the funeral procession for Lamarque is interrupted by the assaulting students, to spy on them Javert is posing as a rebel, but Gavroche exposes him and he is captured, and in the gun battle Marius is saved by sacrificing Éponine, before death she confesses her love, he is devastated. Valjean reading the farewell letter by Cosette realises her feelings for Marius and goes to find and protect him at the barricade, he is allowed to see and execute Javert after saving Enjolras's life, but he chooses to free his former prison guard and fires a fake shot, Javert wonders at his generosity. The students expected the Paris townspeople to join the revolution, the fight to the death is down to them, while Marius is saved by Valjean who drags his unconscious body through the sewers, everyone else is killed, and at the moment of exiting the sewer he is confronted by Javert who threatens to shoot him unless he surrenders, but he continues to save the young man, and conflicting with his thoughts Javert throws himself off a bridge to drown. Marius is recovering and mourning for the death of his friends, but Cosette is there to comfort him, and in private Valjean reveals his past to him and says that his presence puts his daughter in danger so he must leave, and Marius makes a promise to never tell her these truths. Marius and Cosette get married, and after an encounter with Thénardier Marius realises Cosette's father was the one who saved his life, and he and his new wife rush to find his location, they find Valjean dying in the local convent, where the spirit of Fantine is there for him to see and take him to Heaven, the couple find him in his last moments, and he hands Cosette his confession letter, and when he dies Fantine and the Bishop take him to paradise alongside Enjolras, Éponine, Gavroche and other rebels at the barricade. Also starring Frances Ruffelle as Whore and Natalya Angel Wallace as Young Éponine. Jackman is fantastic as the criminal turned humanitarian, Hathaway is magnificent and with her famous song very emotional, and supporting cast members Crowe, Seyfried, Redmayne, Carter and Cohen get their great moments on screen as well, this musical goes a different direction by having the performers sing live rather than mime to pre-recorded, meaning songs like the astounding ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and ""Bring Him Home"" are brilliant, I admit it is lengthy and looks gloomy a lot of the time, but the sweeping camera shots, marvellous costumes and rousing feel add up to a sensational period musical. It won the Oscars for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Song for ""Suddenly"", Best Production Design and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Make Up & Hair, Production Design and Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film, Cinematography, Costume Design and Outstanding British Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Original Song for ""Suddenly"".

","Since so much has been written already about this movie, you are probably aware of two facts that I will mention here, that I believe, kill most of the potential this movie had to become excellent:<br/><br/>1) Extremely bad CG ruins your immersion in the story:<br/><br/>When seeing the main characters move in the screen with an extremely bad computer graphics background behind, it suddenly reminds me that this is a movie, that this man is an actor, that the background doesn't really exist and that there are lots of technicians trying to fix that mess. I don't want that, I want to forget that it's a movie and I want to dive inside the story, but the extremely bad and distracting CG makes it very difficult. <br/><br/>2) The choice of the actors singing ""live"" brings an additional problem:<br/><br/>Here I am only guessing, but I am willing to bet that the choice of having the actors singing live, involved certain logistics that could only be achieved if most of the shots were static with very little movement and editing. That choice of directing makes that instead of a movie feeling, we get some sort of music concert feeling. In fact, this movie feels as static as the actual musical, but instead of a stage with live singers, you get a cinema screen.<br/><br/>If you are looking for drama and emotion, look somewhere else. The story has a lot of drama potential, but the directing choices and the distracting CG, kill most of that potential, so it ends up being a boring and extremely long piece that makes you come out of the cinema thinking ""What could have been""."
"akvilonn","6","1","3","26 January 2013"," Cinematic-performance wise - great. NOT the singing.
","Well, opening sequence was awesome, that is until I heard Russell Crowe sing.

Music orchestra IS awesome. <br/><br/>Crowd song signing is actually the best. Costumes and clothing - almost PERFECT. <br/><br/>And for the real experience, please watch 1998 movie, Les Miserables with Liam Neeson."
"eirinorum","6","1","3","24 January 2013"," Disappointing
","Despite not having read the book or seen the musical, I knew we should be prepared for tears and misery in this film, and looked forward to having a good cry to some beautiful music (I have sung quite a few of the songs/heard them sung through years in a choir). It did not turn out quite that way.<br/><br/>The opening scene was strange to someone who once had an office in a boat museum: why would they try to pull in a huge ship at such an angle during a storm? And why was the singing so distant and weak? I later learned that it was shot live, so I guess that's what it DID sound like when the wind blew the words away, but it took away from the emotional intensity of the song, it did not convey just how menacing the guards were, and how the prisoners were at their mercy.<br/><br/>The lead character, Jean Valjean, also surprised me by not ""coming through"" the screen. I only sat up and took interest when the priest entered the scene. There was that stage presence and interesting voice! And there was the heart in the acting that made it thoroughly believable that he saw an opportunity to save a wretched soul for God. The church was gorgeous, and Jackman's acting picked up a bit during his transformation.<br/><br/>I was a bit confused by the change to the next section: how did throwing away your prison record and assuming a false identity lead to becoming a very wealthy factory owner and even mayor? From this point on, Jackman's acting is up to par, and his singing is passable, but the same cannot be said for his adversary, Javert, who remains unimpressive throughout the movie. Russel Crowe is not half the actor he's cracked up to be, and should never carry a lead singing role.<br/><br/>Fantine's story is briefly told, beautifully acted and sung magnificently, but the portrayal of the slums and other prostitutes is farcical to the point of being disrespectful. Way too many close-ups of horrid make-up and horribly made-up skin problems! What sticks to my mind from this part of the film is the panorama from the hospital with all the curtains going on ""forever"", probably because such perspective is hardly ever seen in this movie.<br/><br/>Young Cosette did not convince me. She looked and sang OK, but lacked intensity. And the comic relief that should be provided by the Thenardiers disappeared because they just came across as creepy and cunning. <br/><br/>The second act introduction of Marius and his grandfather makes it understandable that he has real passion for the revolution, but the other young men remain background. What remains a mystery is Marius' passion for Cosette, who is about as flat and boring as a character can be, and the passion he instills in the unbelievably gorgeous, tiny- waisted and credible Eponine, who was the person in this movie that really sang the best. Perfectly cast! (I have later learned that she was cast from the same role in the musical, no wonder!). <br/><br/>About the singing: much of the dialogic singing did not work at all. It also sounded like the score had been transposed up? Or was it just that all the voices (except the three singers) were strained on the high notes? All the males certainly sounded MUCH better on the rare low notes!<br/><br/>There are two more things worth mentioning: * Gavroche is amazing! He lights up everything around him, steals the scene, and sings up a storm (never mind that he has a completely different accent from the rest of the cast). * The director's choice of using so many close-ups is almost unbearable at times. My daughter had her fill when Valjean and Marius fall into the sewer, and I agree with her that this is unnecessarily gross.<br/><br/>My rating would have been much lower if not for Eponine, Gavroche, the priest and the music."
"Scrius","Null","1","3","22 January 2013"," Surely the best cinematic adaptation of one of literature and theater's great classics.
","There's no need to vouch for the musical that swept the world. Few are as celebrated as Les Miserables, and for all the right reasons. The musical production was truly beyond compare. Its songs; powerful, its acting; stellar, the storytelling; wondrous; and its impact; everlasting. It's long earned its place as my favorite. To develop a work of cinema out of this phenomenon would be a great challenge requiring respectful care, but would not be an impossible matter. This much is established by Tom Hooper's most recent addition to his growing body of ambitious work, an entertaining film adaptation that faithfully emphasized the themes that countless viewers, myself among them, fell in love with. <br/><br/>The movie follows the same path as the musical, starting with Jean Valjean's release from 19 years of slavery on a charge of stealing bread to feed his starving family and his failed attempts at escape. A Bishop who shows him compassion and the path to salvation sparks Valjean's journey to redemption. Henceforth dedicated to upholding his bargain with God, Valjean assumes a new identity and a new life, breaking his parole to fulfill his mission to show the world the goodness that he has found within himself. Years pass and by that time Valjean has become a respected factory owner and the mayor of a town that prospered under his reign. An intervention of fate leads Valjean to a new task that would change his life once again. Fantine, a desperate woman symbolic of the miserable life of poverty in France was betrayed and deserted by her lover. Left alone with Cosette, the child she bore out of wedlock, she commits herself entirely to her daughters welfare, going as far as to sell her own body for the coin she needs to ensure her daughter's survival. As Fantine lies dying from an illness, Valjean learns that he had a part in her downfall. Fantine had been a worker in his factory who Valjean fired at the request of his lecherous foreman after she rejected his advances. Overcome by guilt and wishing to make amends he now makes another promise of a lifetime – to become the father Cosette never knew and raise her as his own. Valjean finds Cosette and what then begins is something greater than he could ever imagine being possible; he experiences love for the first time, a sequence illuminated in a beautiful song; one of the original touches this movie delivers which has rightfully earned its academy award nomination. <br/><br/>Made possible by Victor Hugo's novel, Les Miserables is a timeless story filled with timeless characters and enriched by timeless themes. The essential pillars which hold the structure upright are the complex forces that come into play. Throughout the course of the story, Valjean is hunted by his obsessive enemy Inspector Javert; a man obligated by his duty to the law who shows no remorse for those he perceives as unjust. Since he does this sincerely in the name of God, he and Valjean prove to be two sides of the same coin. Javert isn't evil, but his own unbending sense of Justice renders him blind to the forces that can lead weaker men astray. This and his complete lack of compassion for those he considers sinners ultimately lead to his tragic downfall when he realizes that Valjean is a better man than he. The Thénardier couple, an innkeeper and his wife, who kept Cosette in a dismal life of servitude light the tone of the story with comedic appeal. All of these events unfold in the midst of a revolution of youths rising up against an oppressive government, under the leadership of the dashing and charismatic Enjolras and Marius Pontmercy (who would later develop a loving relationship with Cosette). Within this turmoil, all the characters find themselves bound. <br/><br/>Fresh from the success of The King's Speech and the John Adams mini series, Tom Hooper gave the world of Les Miserables a gritty and down-to-earth atmosphere and took the unusual step of recording the songs during the filming rather than dubbing the voices in later. This is where the movie has fallen flat for those expecting top-notch vocal performances. More focus is thus placed on the acting as opposed to singing and it doesn't seem fair to compare the actors to their musical theater counterparts. There are enough positive elements to overwhelm the negatives, including the Oscar nominated performances of Hugh Jackman (who is no stranger to the musical world and as a result is absolutely wonderful portraying Jean Valjean) and Anne Hathaway, who despite having much less screen time, delivers a stunning performance as Fantine. Her scene involving the famous song ""I Dreamed a Dream"" shows how far she has come since Princess Diaries, a powerful blend of song and emotional acting. The production value reflects the tone that was intended and enables the viewers to immerse themselves in the world of strife and struggle; to savor all the passion. The most important aspect is conveying all the emotions and all the themes for which Les Miserables the classic novel and classic musical is rightfully renowned for – liberty, love, redemption, and the triumph of the human spirit even when the battle is lost. <br/><br/>I admire all movies that take risks, those that take a path that conformist filmmakers dare not tread. Tom Hooper's Les Miserables is a work of exceptional fidelity that is surely the best cinematic adaptation of one of literature and theater's great classics. The cinematic experience is one that won't soon diminish for me and frankly I hope it never will!"

","The movie is a roller-coaster of a performance, that will have you all over the board in emotions. Not all the cast can sing well, but with what they lack in singing skill they make up in their performance with the emotional tones and display, that actually carries the movie in its own way to a new level of excellence. I was shocked at first to hear such moderate to even poor singing ability at first by some of the cast, but then their skills in acting took over and made up with diamonds to compensate for that lack. The performance by everyone from short scenes to full carriage was above excellent. This is a must see movie!"
"Anurag-Shetty","6","1","3","20 January 2013"," A flawed yet charming musical.
","Les Miserables is a musical, set during the French revolution, about Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman) who breaks his parole & is viciously hunted by police chief, Javert(Russell Crowe). Valjean agrees to adopt Cosette(Amanda Seyfried), who is the daughter of Fantine(Anne Hathaway). After adopting Cosette, Valjean's life changes forever. The supporting characters include, Marius(Eddie Redmayne), Eponine(Samantha Barks), Thenardier(Sacha Baron Cohen) & Madame Thenardier(Helena Bonham Carter).<br/><br/>I would like to start by saying, Les Miserables is a good movie but, definitely not a great movie. The movie's story, based on the book & the play of the same name, is touching & brilliant. However, the story is hampered by the constant singing throughout the duration of the film. All the words that come out of all the different characters' mouths is in the form of a song. Not even a single dialog is uttered throughout the movie. Whether they're dueling with the policemen, happy, sad, heartbroken, or even dying they sing about everything. This can get extremely frustrating, at times. This is the movie's greatest flaw. A note on the performances. Hugh Jackman is mind blowing as Jean Valjean. His role in this film is completely different from X-Men antihero, Wolverine. This movie proves that, Jackman can attack any role with the same dedication that he attacks the role of Wolverine. Russell Crowe is brilliant as the antagonist, Javert. We really do love to hate him. Anne Hathaway has given one of the best performances of her career as nice girl turned prostitute, Fantine. Amanda Seyfried is great as Cosette. Eddie Redmayne is spectacular as Marius. Samantha Barks is impressive as Eponine. Helena Bonham Carter & Sacha Baron Cohen are hilarious as Madame Thenardier & Thenardier respectively. All the actors sing beautifully. The most impressive part is that they all sang live while they were shooting. Although Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway deserved their Golden Globes for Best Actor & Best Supporting Actress respectively, I doubt the movie deserved the Golden Globe for Best Film: Comedy or Musical. I'm sure the Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence starer, Silver Linings Playbook was a better movie. Anyway, I would like to conclude by saying, watch Les Miserables only if you love musicals. However, I'd recommend that you give this one a miss if you hate a movie with songs every one minute or so."

This movie was amazing, the characters, the passion the emotion. I soon got used to the singing and really enjoyed it. Hugh Jackman should win an Oscar he had a fantastic voice and delivered so much passion and emotion in his role All the characters are great, from Russell crowe to sasha baron cohen, the people in the French revolution, the cast are amazing This is the story of deliverance, happiness and love despite all the problems and suffering in the world and poverty. Totalling gripping from start to end this is the essence of LIFE, the essence of True film making, not rubbish super heroes like Hulk Ironman and nonsense. This was real, raw human emotion, love, god it hits you in the heart and you have so much connection with the characters.<br/><br/>Easily the best film I have seen for the last five years It is packed full of emotion and passion I recommend it, but it is a bit sad but that's Life!!"

","Box Office records have been truly broken after the release of Les Misérables, and rightly so.<br/><br/>Not only that the soundtrack has raced to the top of the the albums charts in US and UK.<br/><br/>Over 60 million theatregoers have watched the stage version of this phenomenal musical worldwide and the people are still flocking in. All those people surely cannot be wrong.<br/><br/>All this should tell us something about this immaculate story, which could arguably be the saddest story every told.<br/><br/>Thank you Victor Hugo for possibly the most emotional story ever penned. I am sure he will be dancing in heaven knowing that such a libretto and musical composition has been created.<br/><br/>I won't go into the complete storyline of Les Misérables because I am sure most of you know it.<br/><br/>With regard to the movie.<br/><br/>It is never an easy task to create a musical movie from a stage musical but where Phantom of the Opera was not I am afraid to say totally successful, Les Misérables succeeded superbly.<br/><br/>Thanks mainly I suspect to the man with the Midas touch, Cameron Mackintosh.<br/><br/>Each actor played their part superbly, Hugh Jackman (Jean Valjean), Russell Crowe (Inspector Javert), Amanda Seyfried (Cosette), Eddie Redmayne (Marius), Sacha Baron Cohen (Thénardier), Helena Bonham Carter (Madame Thénardier) and Samantha Barks (Éponine) and everyone who appeared right down to the smallest part.<br/><br/>We must not forget the wonderful performance of Daniel Huttlestone who played the young lad Gavroche nor the delightful Isabelle Allen who portrayed the young Cosette. Although Isabelle was not on screen for very long she played a wonderful young Cosette and Daniel's presence on screen was certainly very memorable.<br/><br/>Added to this I was amazed that everyone of them had a more than passable singing voice, something I would never have associated with some of the actors, especially Crowe and Jackman but both Amanda Seyfried and Samantha Barks are well established for their extremely powerful singing voices. In fact Samantha Barks sang the role of Éponine in the Les Misérables 25th Anniversary concert.<br/><br/>Also Colm Wilkinson played the role of the priest in this movie but he sang the role of Valjean in the 10th Anniversary concert of Les Misérables.<br/><br/>One little known fact is that Wilkinson also appeared in the 1978 Eurovision Song Contest where he reached 5th place for Ireland singing 'Born To Sing' he was known as Colm T Wilkinson then. I hope Colm won't cringe when I mention this.<br/><br/>There is one star I have not yet mentioned and that is Anne Hathaway.<br/><br/>She played the role of Fantine.<br/><br/>Although she was not on screen for the entire movie I have to say that she was without doubt the finest actor in the movie. When she was in front of camera she was simply electrifying and this I feel was by far the best performance she has ever given and she will find it extremely difficult to surpass it.<br/><br/>Anne (Fantine) was perfection and when she was on screen it was impossible to take your eyes off her. Anne can also certainly be proud of her singing voice.<br/><br/>SPOILER BEGINS <br/><br/>Fantine works in Valjean's factory and is hounded by her fellow workers which ends up with her being dismissed. Fantine is a single mother with a daughter (Cosette) who is being cared for by the innkeeper (Thénardier) and his wife. I say cared for but she is treated with terrible cruelty and is no more than a slave to them.<br/><br/>With no work or money Hathaway (Fantine) sells her long hair for a few francs.<br/><br/>This scene for me was the nothing more than heartrending because Anne actually allowed her hair to be cut off on camera and did not rely on skullcaps or wigs. The expression of pain and horror on Anne's face as this was being done I am sure was not an act.<br/><br/>Fantine still did not have enough money to send to the Thénardier's so she sold two of her teeth also, although Anne permitted her hair to be cut off she drew the line at having her teeth actually pulled, although it was jokingly (I assume) suggested.<br/><br/>Anne said in an interview that it was one thing losing something that will grow back but when it comes to actually losing teeth it was another matter. I can't say I blame her one little bit.<br/><br/>Still with no money she very reluctantly turns to prostitution to earn enough money for the upkeep of her daughter Cosette.<br/><br/>Fantine ends up extremely ill, I assume with an anti-social disease and is dying. Jean Valjean takes her into his care but Fantine sadly dies, but not before making Valjean promise to rescue and care for her daughter Cosette.<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDS <br/><br/>Another tremendous plus for Les Misérables for me is the fact that the songs were actually sung on screen and not dubbed after the movie was completed. The actors had headphones hidden in their ears to enable them to hear the music and to do this, although the headphones could not be seen.<br/><br/>I feel sure that every aspect of this musical will stay in the memory of those watching it for a long time to come.<br/><br/>The direction of Tom Hooper was second to none and from the locations to the scenery to the costumes all were just perfect.<br/><br/>We must of course not forget Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil for their truly memorable music and lyrics respectively.<br/><br/>Les Miserables is up for a fistful of Oscars and other awards. I believe they deserve to win every one.<br/><br/>plutus1947"

","'Les Miserables' is the film adaptation of the theatre adaptation of the novel by Victor Hugo. Directed by Tom Hooper (The King's Speech), it tells the story of Jean Valjean's (Hugh Jackman) – an escaped convict who adopts and raises a child in the middle of revolutionary France.<br/><br/>The cast, on paper, is quite impressive; everyone will be a fan of at least one member of this ensemble it is that diverse. Thankfully, the great cast live up to everyone's expectations and do a really great job here. Hugh Jackman does well in this; he acts well, provides an extraordinary amount of emotion in crucial scenes and his singing isn't bad either. Amanda Seyfried did well here too but her character does not have a great amount of screen-time despite being the core of the film. Eddie Redmayne really surprised me here; he gives a truly fantastic performance and it is unfortunate that he does not appear to have had any award recognition for his work. Another surprising performance was that of Aaron Tveit, an actor I was not familiar with until I watched this. Of course, Anne Hathaway steals the show as Fantine. Her great singing and highly emotional scenes instantly win over people who aren't really fans of musicals. Russell Crowe is the only actor here who disappoints; you can't really expect excellent singing from everyone because they are actors, not singers. Russell Crowe obviously struggled to do the two things at once because everyone else manages to bring emotion to their scenes whereas his facial expression does not change at all when singing – I'm sure he would have given an admirable performance here if he did not have to sing but unfortunately he chose a musical in which all dialogue is sung. <br/><br/>The endless singing can get on your nerves a little but only when it is not during a huge song piece and they are genuinely just singing bits of dialogue. These moments are few and far between though. It was very brave of Tom Hooper to decide that there should be live singing but it has worked out well and made the film a lot better than it would have been. 'Les Miserables' is almost three hours long but it is not a chore to watch, there is no point where you feel bored or that the plot is moving along slowly. The whole film builds up to a truly fantastic climax that raises everyone's spirits.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a highly emotional musical which I think will bring them back into fashion. If they're all as good as Les Mis then I welcome them."
"asda-man","10","1","3","17 January 2013"," One of the greatest films I've ever seen
","I think it's important that I start off by saying that I've never seen the stage version of Les Miserables, nor have I read the original book. In fact, going in I had no real clue what the film was about at all! Also with all the hype surrounding it, I was preparing myself for something unbelievably good and that's exactly what I got. 2013's only just begun yet Les Miserables is already looking like it's going to be the film of the year (as it came out in January in the UK). It's a spectacular achievement with every department exceeding themselves, whether it be acting, directing or music.<br/><br/>I knew that Les Miserables was going to be pretty incredible right from the opening shot with the camera creeping out of the water (and I don't think it's any coincidence that the final shot was soaring in the sky) and sweeping over a huge ship which hundreds of convicts are pulling at with thick ropes. It's a truly epic shot which immediately sets the tone and scope of the film. The image of Russell Crowe pacing up and down over them is also not just phenomenal directing but spectacular cinematography which doesn't hold up until the credits arrive. It immediately transports you to the location and I found myself being sucked in until the very last frame.<br/><br/>There was a moment when I realised that what I was watching was quite extraordinary mid-way through one of Hugh Jackman's first songs in a church, as I realised that this song was being sung in almost one shot and it was conveying so much power! The scene is only heightened by the extraordinary sweeping extreme long shot which plunges into the depths of Paris at its most depraved. Anne Hathaway's rendition of I Dreamed A Dream is also one of the most astonishing moments in the film as it's sung in one shot and almost entirely a close-up! It gives the song and the character so much power and you can't help but feel moved by it.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway's role is barely 15 minutes long but in the style of Anthony Hopkins and Judi Dench she could very well win the Oscar despite the little screen time. The role she plays is already significant, but Anne gives it even more significance as we see a woman at the lowest point in her life with zero hope and nothing to live for but her child (the poster girl). Similarly Helena and Sacha have few minutes on screen but offer us so much more. They provide some much needed light relief after some of the most depressing moments captured on film. Sacha is a great actor and is naturally funny so it's great to see him in an actual funny role rather than one of his crude obnoxious characters which serve more to shock than to amuse.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman should also have a high chance for the Oscar (although I do think it will go to Daniel) for he breathes such likable life into his character. Now Hugh and Russell may not be able to sing very well but let's not forget that they're not just singing, they're acting as well and they're fantastic in their roles (besides their not Pierce Brosnan bad!) I hate to admit it but Hugh and Anne did make me go a little teary at the end, however they failed to push out even a very small man tear, as it seems bizarrely, only the Nutty Professor has the power to make me cry! The narrative motors along in a breeze. Some people moan about pacing issues but I found it to be one of the fastest two and a half hours I've experienced, in fact I didn't really want the film to end, and extra character development on certain characters would've been appreciated. Yes some scenes maybe did drag longer than they needed to, but in a film of such length that's to be expected and by no means does it effect the overall film. The narrative features such likable and deep characters that you can't help but find yourself become completely involved in the story and their lives.<br/><br/>The production design is also astounding. The costumes and sets are all above par and really help to transport you there, making it more of an experience than a film. Tom Hooper's directing is also nothing short of incredible. At times it felt as if Darren Aronofsky was behind the camera! I know he already won an Oscar for the King's Speech, but here his directing is even better. The raw hand held close-ups on certain characters convey a certain power that's difficult to put into words. He directs on such an epic scale and knows exactly when and where to place the camera. His gorgeous directing alone is worth the price of a ticket! Les Mis also made me produce quite a few chills throughout, which is certainly a sign of a masterpiece and that's exactly what it is. The film conveys such power and in the end becomes incredibly uplifting and the only way to get that feeling is to watch it again. I can see myself watching Les Miserables as many times as Matthew Crawley's mother sits in the front of a car (i.e. A lot!) I'll be counting down the days until its out, until I can see this extraordinary master work again. Even if the idea of people singing constantly puts you off, go and see it, trust me it didn't bother me at all and by the end of it you start to think it's weird when they speak! Films with this power don't come along very often, so you'd be a fool to miss out!"
"heartinstone","8","1","3","15 January 2013"," Les Miserables...Le Misery...
","I had been waiting to see this movie from the first time it was said to be released. All the previews and all the behind the scenes special made me really excited for it. Fortunately, I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie .Unfortunately, it was not as epic as I had hoped. <br/><br/>Adam Lambert may have slammed the movie, saying that Hooper should have tweaked the music in the studio to make it sweeter. He also declared that Hooper should have chosen actors that could sing, and that the voices threw off the concentration and the enjoyment of the movie. <br/><br/>I wholeheartedly disagree. Most of these actors have had Broadway experience. With the exception of Russell Crowe, each of these actors performed spectacularly. I loved the raw and real feel of the singing. Hooper was right not to tweak the vocals. Crowe was probably the weakest one in the group, and all though his voice was not to par with the others, it got better as he went along. All though, what was different about Crowe is that he seemed to have trouble acting and singing at the same time, and I felt he mostly concentrated on trying to move and sing, rather than act and sing. <br/><br/>Hathaway's performance of Fontine was so incredible. I could barely take my eyes off screen because she was so amazing. Her voice is beautiful and her performance was so real...it effected me in more ways than one. Fontine is such a minor character, but Hathaway's performance made it more meaningful. If she doesn't win best supporting actress, then I don't know what the Academy has against her. <br/><br/>This version of Les Miserables is definitely something to watch. I don't personally feel it will win best picture, but it is still a great movie to watch. Trust me, I had the songs stuck in my head after watching it, lol. (Just a note: if you are not a Broadway or theater person, you might think other wise. This kind of movie is not for everyone, as there is pretty much all singing and barely any spoken acting)"
"jwardww","6","1","3","13 January 2013"," Miserere nobis! Save this artifact with selective dubbing.
","Apart from the portrayal of Javert, there's nothing essentially wrong with the acting here. Of course, it's easy to fault Crowe's conception, when one has the genius performance of Charles Laughton as Javert to compare it with. In that much earlier film one ends up caring more about Javert's tragedy than about Valjean's thwarted love story. That being said, you can save this very expensive new edition by dubbing the roles of Fantine, Javert and Valjean with real singers. Consider it very post, post production. For Fantine, get someone like Christine Andreas. Tap Norm Lewis for Javert, and Jonas Kaufmann for Valjean. The third stand-in is an A-list opera tenor, which one apparently needs to get the role's long recitatives executed with conviction and musicality. In fact, some of his music was borrowed from a real opera. The show is through composed, so every line is set to music. If one is not musical, that can be disastrous. The three actors cast here could not handle this style of sung dialog and most of their work is painful to the ear. That seems odd. It's not as if this were Janacek's From the House of the Dead or something vocally challenging, but apparently beyond the efforts of these leads. As for the music itself, it is not that extraordinary, except for Valjean's big number, Bring Him Home, which everyone knows was stolen from the Humming Chorus of Puccini's Madama Butterfly. However, this film is worth saving, as the art direction and cinematography are fine and all the other characters sing beautifully, even Amanda Seyfried. Barks' Eponine gives a vocal performance that will give you chills."

The vocals are spot on (save for Russell Crowe, his were lacking a bit of depth. However, his portrayal of Javert was impeccable).<br/><br/>There can't be more than 10 spoken words in the entire film. The music carries the film incredibly well.

","Today I have just watched Les Miserables. It's the first time I've heard people clapping in the cinema after the movie ended. I couldn't clap my hands cuz I was busy shedding tears.The movie is just too beautiful. When I was a kid,I read a review of the book. The critic wrote that Gavroche was an angel. And today he's really a lovely angel to me. The music is amazing. "" I dreamed a dream"" is never that touching. I love every character in the movie. All the cast did their good job. Even though the film is quite long, I just want it to last forever. I cherish every moment of it. Thanks Tom Hooper for bringing us such an awesome movie. Next Saturday I will definitely go to the cinema to watch it again :)"
"DavidTL","6","1","3","12 January 2013"," The Miserables
","‎Les Misérables. What to say? Quite a lot. Tom Hooper seemed to be more interested in adapting the musical than creating a movie with a coherent plot and good character development. Theatre and film is very different, and with the theatre can get away with more things.<br/><br/>You didn't have enough time to care for the characters, and some scenes took place in the same location for way too long and the sets sometimes actually look like film sets than real life, which made it feel more like a filmed version of the stage play than a movie. They also changed some shots you'll see in the trailer which is annoying as they were better in the trailer than the changed ones in the movie. It feels like they cut a scene short. The film doesn't deserve all the nominations it received, but Anne Hathaway does but I also feel they cut or trimmed some of her scenes or changed the shots that were used in the trailer which were frankly better and showed her acting ability a lot more.<br/><br/>I don't mind musicals that are sung through, don't mind them at all. But for the movie they should have changed some parts to just dialogue. They did that with the The Phantom of the Opera musical movie. The stage show is sung through after the prologue but in the movie they changed parts of songs to dialogue, because they actually don't need to be sung. And if they did this they could have added additional dialogue where there is more character development, which there currently isn't at all, just forced friendships. The film doesn't focus on the people of France much for me to care about their revolution and this is where scenes with normal talking could have helped. All of the main songs in the film that actually add to the plot could still be sung, but not every single one. It also would have made it more powerful when songs did kick in. <br/><br/>Javert's suicide also feels random, but I believe that he just became obsessed with hunting down Valjean over the years and kills himself so at least one of them will be free, because he knows that if he does capture him, he'll feel lost as it became his life-long obsession to arrest Valjean. I also can't help but feel that the creation of a new song for the film, which was 'Suddenly' was created just in hope for it to be up for a possible Best Original Song nomination, which it has been.<br/><br/>The acting, directing, cinematography and singing is brilliant, but work on the script was needed."
"jamaalrgreen","8","1","3","9 January 2013"," As good as a movie musical can be
","Les Miserables was a fantastic adaptation of the musical into a movie musical. Direction by Tom Hooper (The Kings Speech)was spot on as each character was recreated fabulously. If you are not a fan of the musical then this won't change your mind. This musical film version of the Les Mis is far Superior to the the dramatic version released a few years back starring Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush. I would give the entire cast an A for effort in doing justice to the musical singing wise. Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried have beautiful voices and Hugh Jackman is just an animal. He eats up the role of Val Jean and would fit right in on Broadway. I didn't expect the actors in this film to contend with the Broadway or London productions of Les Mis but they did well. The only roughness was Russell Crowe whose voice is just not strong enough for this kind of material but he covers himself well as the hawkish Javert with his strong acting skills. The supporting cast all performed well especially the young lad who played Gavroche. The cinematography was stunning as well as the set work. My only complaint was the over reliance on the close up during several of the characters singing performances. I don't think I could sit through any other movie musical without getting restless leg but Les Mis scored an 8 out of 10 to me and will contend for several awards"
"Ric-7","6","1","3","9 January 2013"," Wanted to like this much much more
","I felt very Miserables as I sat there, the only person in the theatre. The transfer from stage to screen was filled with problems. First, they couldn't cast basic unknowns in the lead roles of a big budget movie. They certainly could have found some actors/actresses who did Les Miz on stage and cast them (because they would know how to sing).<br/><br/>If this was just a remake of the non-musical earlier films, I'd say that the acting was inspired, and a film with the same actors, sets, direction, but without singing, would be Oscar-worthy. Unfortunately, I found that the biggest distraction was the music. Bad thing about a musical.<br/><br/>This is basically an opera. Onstage, there were only a few words which were spoken--everything else was sung. In an opera, the effect is created by beautiful music, expressive lyrics which denote what the characters are feeling, and singers who can sing. In grand opera, the typical audience member is far away (there are no close-ups), so subtle emoting is unnecessary in opera--the lyrics tell you what the character is feeling, and your imagination supplies what he or she might have as facial expressions, based on the lyrics.<br/><br/>So having an extremely talented film actor (but a very mediocre singer) such as Russell Crowe sing a major role is a big problem. Expressive lyrics were unnecessary for him to put across the mental anguish of his character--his few non-singing moments were absolute perfection, because Javert is a very, very difficult character to make convincing. However, his final aria was unnecessary because he had already conveyed every word in that aria, but without signing. For example, when you see the film, he silently pins a medal on someone, and that five seconds on film said more than the final aria.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was acceptable as Jean Valjean, but this should not be surprising because he won a Tony Award for singing Curley (Gordon MacRae's role) in Oklahoma!, in a Broadway revival. And he is an absolutely terrific musical stage actor. I can't fault his acting or singing. And noteworthy is the fact that the filmmakers resisted the temptation to find some excuse for Jean Valjean to lose his shirt, which in general is kind of a waste in a Hugh Jackman film, but TG they avoided unhelpful show-stoppers.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway was great, having to sing a deathbed soliloquy naturalistically in close-up horror-show makeup, but the director's insistence on putting her in excessively squalid surroundings was unnecessary, distracting, and counterproductive. Really: someone who has been so abused and is dying of consumption is not going to be warbling like a nightingale. Give the girl a break.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried was surprising as Cosette. She started in soap operas, and had a few interesting but non-descript roles (she is playing Linda Lovelace in the film of that title to be released this year). Here she sings a high soprano flawlessly.<br/><br/>When you see the film and are amazed at how great Eponine sings her songs: Samantha Barks (Eponine) played the role onstage.<br/><br/>The Thenardier couple is played by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, and they are an invaluable addition of comic relief to a very downbeat story. I thought their opening number could have been a lot better if it had remained a rousing bar-song rather than turning it into a parade of unnecessarily-real grotesques.<br/><br/>If you are not familiar with the musical, then the film may give you a good idea of what the stage show was. The dilemma faced by this film was how to replicate the stage show with the best chance for financial success.<br/><br/>The final scene is a close (and very good) replication of the stage version. And the Bishop, who appeared early in the film and had very very much to do with all that happens afterwards, makes a return appearance for the finale. In the film, the part is played by Colm Wilkinson, the first Jean Valjean in the Broadway show.<br/><br/>You probably should see the film. I am not saying you should rush out and pay full price."
"MarkFreedmanNY","10","1","3","7 January 2013"," Met My Expectations
","We saw Les Miz a few days ago, and now that I've let it sink, I can say that it was really *great*.<br/><br/>I don't know if listening to a soundtrack of it works too well -- unlike the play, you need the visuals with the music. The decision for recording the singing live was wise. The emotional impact makes it worth it. I know some people complained of the close ups, but I thought that was essential.<br/><br/>But if you want to listen to a recording, the 10th anniversary edition is the one to go to.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway's performance is Oscar material, and not for just her ""I Dreamed a Dream"" performance, but for her entire performance (no matter how short it was). Isabelle Allen as the young Cosette was terrific, as was Eddie Redmayne as Marius. As a matter of fact, almost everyone was great. Even Russell Crowe, who singing may have been the weakest, made up for it with his performance. The most disappointing performance, although still amusing, was Helena Bonham Carter, unfortunately. She didn't bring her ""A"" game, like she did for Harry Potter. She actually seemed a bit bored.<br/><br/>But it lIved up to my expectations. Highly recommended."

","'LES MISERABLES': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Director Tom Hooper's British film adaptation of the immensely popular French musical play (by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michael Shonberg) from the 1980s which was adapted from the 1862 French novel by Victor Hugo. It's the first time the musical play has been adapted into film form and is entirely 'sung-through' (like the play), which I wasn't expecting. It was scripted by Boblil, Shonberg, Herbert Kretzmer and William Nicholson and stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. The film contains all the songs from the play except one (although some have been shortened) and contains one new song (Oscar hopeful 'Suddenly'). The actors all did their own vocals live on set using only piano accompaniments, through earpieces, to sing to. I've never seen the musical, any other film adaptations or read the novel so I knew little about the storyline or what to expect (I have heard many of the songs multiple times before though). For me it was an interesting and awe-inspiring film-going experience that took some time to process (how I felt about it) but came to the conclusion that it's a musical masterpiece and one of the best films of the year!<br/><br/>The film is set in 19th-century France and centers on an ex-convict named Jean Valjean (Jackman) who breaks parole in 1815, after serving a nineteen-year prison sentence for theft. He moves to a town called Montreuil-sur-Mer and becomes mayor, as well as purchases a factory. One of his employees, named Fantine (Hathaway), is fired by the foreman for having an illegitimate child, named Cosette (Isabelle Allen). She turns to a life of prostitution on the streets and grows ill. When Jean Valjean comes across her, and learns he is somewhat responsible for her condition, he vows to take care of her child (as she dies in a hospital). The rest of the film focuses on Valjean raising Cosette to adulthood (then played by Seyfried) as she falls in love with a student turned revolutionary fighter named Marius (Redmayne). Valjean is also constantly pursued by the prison guard turned police inspector who released him (Crowe) while Marius's friend Eponine (Barks, who also played the part in the 25th Anniversary Concert) deals with her rejected love for her friend.<br/><br/>I do love musicals if they're done right. I think they're a very beautiful and artistic form of film that requires a lot of skill to do right (more so than most other film genres). A great deal of likability to a musical has to do with how good the music is though (and if the viewer likes it). So if you don't like a lot of the music in a musical you're probably not going to like the film very much either (no matter how much it might work on other levels). Here the music is about as good as it gets and the rest of the film is so beautiful to look at and acted so well (especially Hathaway, Jackman and Barks) that one almost has to give it respect. It is odd at first to see the characters singing nonstop (if you're not prepared or used to it) and some of the scenes seem to go on for too long. Also it's hard to really develop the characters well when you only get to know them through singing. Due to these flaws I wasn't sure how I completely felt about the film but I knew I was blown away by parts of it and loved the music and performances (all of the actors do a decent to excellent job singing). A lot of the time the films you have to think about for a while (and come to love more over time) are the very best ones. This is definitely a unique and wonderful film going experience.

"jameshspanos","9","1","3","4 January 2013"," One of the highlights of the year
","Les Misérables is a beautifully crafted and beautifully acted movie that will not only entertain and enthrall musical lovers but also anyone who enjoys a good movie.<br/><br/>To give you a bit of background I am an eighteen year old male and that means I shouldn't enjoy this movie but in fact I was fixated and engulfed into this world created by Tom Hooper. One of the things that jumped out at me throughout the movie was the lack of movement within the scene (in terms of the camera). The camera is often left focused only on the character singing and this allows you to be enchanted by one of the many fantastic performances in the movie. <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman are just phenomenal in this movie. Both deserve nominations when it comes Oscar time and both were just incredible. The highlight for me was Anne Hathaway performing 'I dreamed a dream' and her performance was just breathtaking. <br/><br/>Something to note is that the actors sang live during the movie. What this means is that they actually performed during the filming and weren't lip syncing over pre-recorded tracks. This was a stroke of genius from Tom Hooper/whoever made that decision because you get to hear such raw emotion and passion and shows just how amazing the performances are.<br/><br/>Sure this movie has it's problems. Some may say it's too long. Some may have issues with some of the cinematography (I don't, I thought everything was shot beautifully) but every movie has it's problems and these nit picky things don't change the fact that I loved the movie and rate it very highly.<br/><br/>If you were already looking forward to seeing it then you won't be disappointed. If you don't like musicals then you might give this a miss but if you're a musical lover or just your average Joe; Les Misérables will provide you with close to three hours of captivating performances and beautifully directed movie."

","From the first note to the last it was an amazing film adaptation. Cameron Mackintosh has assembled a creative team the could reach his expectations, and those of us measly viewers.<br/><br/>The casting was spot on, I have read many reviews that basically said many of the actors were not up to the demand of singing. All I have to say to them is remember this is a film adaptation of a stage production which is apples and oranges. Hugh was Valjean I could not this of any other actor could have played that role and make it believable. Many were worried at the casting of Russell as Javert. They were WRONG, he played Javert straight and narrow, with no shades of gray, and his vocal performance was the same. I can never listen to ""I dreamed a dream"" the same way after Anne's raw emotional=, move over Susan Boyle, there is a new girl in town.<br/><br/>It could bring home some heavy medals during the awards season. which will be well desevrved."
"dgalvin24","7","1","3","3 January 2013"," Very pleasing to the eyes and the ears
","Two years after cleaning up Oscar awards for The King's Speech, Tom Hooper shown the spotlight back on one of the most beloved stories and musicals of all time. The star power and the acting are very compelling even if some of the singing seems forced and difficult for certain numbers. Hugh Jackman changes the tone and volume of his voice as Valjean evolves throughout the movie, but the opening numbers with him seem like they are just barely out of his range, to the point where he sounds nasally. Russell Crowe makes a terrific Javert on paper, but it seems a struggle for him to match the volume of everyone else. In his defense, his performance gave much needed humanity to an otherwise rigid and bombastic policeman chasing a bread thief. The uncertainty and conflict is a welcome touch from Crowe's interpretation of Javert, so much that his performance from an acting standpoint is second only to Anne Hathaway's Fantine. Speaking of which...<br/><br/>Damn....I mean, just...wow. Hathaway owns every single second she is on screen, just as she did as everyone's favorite feline comic book character earlier in the year. She provided the most gut wrenching and heartbreaking martyrdom for any character in recent memory. The fact that she is able to belt out such melancholy notes while maintaining the character's anguish speaks to her true talents as a performer. (Something you have to see to truly appreciate) Some songs felt like they were in the wrong key for some of the cast or that some of the cast was wrong for the key the songs were in, but that couldn't be further from the truth in Hathaway's case. She sounds angelic in every sense of the word. <br/><br/>The cinematography provides for some breathtaking shots of Montreuil, especially during both renditions of ""Look Down"" and the revolution. The idea to fixate the camera on Fantine's face, as well as Valjean and Marius during their respective soliloquies. The supporting cast also provided for a stronger ensemble as the movie did not have to rely entirely on star power. The Thenardiers were appropriately cast (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) even if their characters relied too much on SBC and HBC doing SBC and HBC things. Again, those two are textbook actors for those roles, but I was a little annoyed every time they appeared on screen and I was just as relieved whenever they went away. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like they are both becoming ubiquitous at being cast as the scoundrels and deviants they play in any movie they find themselves in anymore. <br/><br/>It was truly refreshing to see the return of this masterpiece to the forefront of mainstream cinema this year. Some have complained about the casting, but like it or not, Tom Hooper has an Oscar and I have a feeling he knew what he was doing when he made this movie. It probably won't win too many of the big awards aside from Hathaway running away with Supporting Actress, but it's bound to receive a lot of technical recognition. And why not? Hooper's vision was as memorable and stunning as any adaptation of this timeless classic."
"elviskim3","9","1","3","2 January 2013"," Amazing
","I was initially hesitant to see the movie because I am not a big fan of musicals, and when I found out that this movie has little to no dialogues and all the cast sings all the way through the movie, I was really hesitant, but after hearing people raving about how amazing the movie was, I had to see it. And I am glad I did. The chemistry between the cast, the singing, and just movie in general. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I usually don't write reviews, and the only time I ever log onto IMDb is to rate movies, but not write reviews. I logged into IMDb after seeing movies like The Fight Club, Momento, The Pianist, etc. movies that definitely impacted my life, but never left a review, but I feel like this movie is different. I highly recommend it. If you are on the fence about it, go and still see it. You won't regret it."

","Victor Hugo's classic story of Jean Valjean seeking redemption against his pursuer Javert in the midst of a revolution is a powerful one that has already been adapted to film and the stage many times over the last fifty years.

After leaving the prison Valjean finds his way to a convent where a priest offers him food and water. Valjean steals all the valuables he can get his hands on before he runs away, but is captured by the local authorities. The priest plays along with Valjean's story about where he got the gold and silver items which later brings Valjean to an epiphany that will lead to him becoming a new person.

"kylenewalker","8","1","3","2 January 2013"," Did you know that it is a musical?!
","I read a lot of bad reviews before seeing this film. In particular, Entertainment Weekly tore it apart. From what I read, reviewers did not like Hollywood actors singing, long close-ups of said singing actors, and the fact that the singing actors wouldn't stop singing. Well, I guess those reviewers just didn't get it.<br/><br/>Yes, Hugh Jackman does not fill the role that Colm Wilkinson immortalized as Jean Valjean in the London and Broadway stage productions. And I will readily admit that Russell Crowe's singing chops do not match his powerful presence. But the important thing to note about this film is that it is not simply a film adaptation. This is the musical Les Miserables which Tom Hooper happens to have filmed. The performances are real (the actors are singing live on set as opposed to lip-syncing prerecorded songs). And while the singing is not perfect, the performances are genuine and for film you need trained actors to pull that off--not trained singers. Had director Tom Hooper gone for a fully musical theatre trained cast he might have ended up with something more stagnant. Let's face it, Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe are dynamic actors to watch and the flaws in the singing only add to the characters' vulnerabilities as humans with flaws.<br/><br/>There are indeed several long close-ups of the characters singing. Embrace the close-ups. Delight in watching the actors put all of the emotion of that scene into just their faces because, again, there is no lip-syncing. Unlike previous movie-musicals (Chicago, Moulin Rouge) when the camera gets too tight on an actor during a song it becomes painful to watch the actors acting like they're singing. In particular, watch for the lead actors when their emotion over-takes the song--there might be a voice crack, a whispered line, or an unexpected pause--all caught in close-up making the character seem real.<br/><br/>Too much singing, eh? Well, movie-goers should know what they're getting into before going to see a musical. One reviewer complained that it was painful to watch the actors sing through the dialogue. I'm sorry, but that's just the nature of Les Miserables, the type of musical, and its origins in opera--an opera with few recitatives.<br/><br/>Overall, Les Miserables is a masterpiece in its own right. I'm not sure it can compete against other big weights because of the inherent limitations of the musical (I still have no idea why Chicago did so well). Hugh Jackman is incredible from start to finish and Russell Crowe seems to let Javert's hardened sense of duty fill his body as he commands every scene with his body language and stern glare. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys beautiful cinematography (like The King's Speech), who can appreciate Victor Hugo's archetypal and cathartic characters, and who goes in knowing that it is a musical."
"ross_kewl","9","1","3","2 January 2013"," They save the best til last.
","Honestly, 2012 has been a disappointing run of movies. Perhaps it was just my high expectations but films such as Prometheus, Batman, The Bourne Legacy and Skyfall drained my faith in the movie industry. Going into watch Les Miserables, I was not expecting a great film because of the above reasons, (maybe my low expectations is the reason why I think this is one of the best films of the year). Instead what I experienced was an admirable, enjoyable and stunning piece of film. <br/><br/>Being an Australian, I was particularly proud that the two male leads were Australian, namely Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe. Considering the fact that I did not consider these two stars as singers, they did an exceptional job. It was sad that Anne Hathaway's character Fantine was killed off so easily, taking into account how she cut her beautiful long hair for the sake of the movie. However, the unsung heroes for me, was the performance from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as Mr and Mrs Thenardier. Because of the context of the movie, during the cruel times of the French Revolution, it was pleasing to see some comic relief.<br/><br/>It was an emotionally engaging film. Usually the comedy can be less overlooked then emotions of sadness and despair. Even without the laughter I still would of rated this film an 8 just because the hilarity can take a film the next step higher. A good film should engage all senses which Les Miserables achieves.<br/><br/>People who are doubting whether they should see the film because their not huge fans of musicals, well neither was I but I thoroughly enjoyed it an would recommend it to anyone of any tastes."
"Lawlass","10","1","3","31 December 2012"," Fans of the stage production will not be disappointed
","I have seen the stage production of Les Miserables three times. I loved this movie as much as, if not more than, the stage production. I have always found the second act (the revolution plot and the story of young love) to be somewhat dull compared to the first act (Jean Valjean's redemption and Javert's pursuit of justice); this is so, despite my favorite songs being contained in the second act. However, the movie production kept me consistently interested in the characters, such that, for the first time, I really cared about the revolutionaries and the young lovers.<br/><br/>While all the actors were superb in their roles, I was awestruck by Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Fantine. Her facial expressions, her physical transformation, and the depth of misery in her eyes, combined with her enormous talent as a vocalist, had me crying with compassion throughout most of her performance. She deserves an Oscar for her performance.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was excellent as Jean Valjean and really hit a home-run in singing my favorite tune, Bring Him Home. Jackman was really flawless throughout the film, with his vocals and his acting performance. He deserves an Oscar nomination, but I think that Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond in Skyfall should be rewarded with an Oscar over Jackman's Jean Valjean (and yes, I have seen that bore of a movie, Lincoln, which should not be nominated for anything except for the Why in the World did Daniel Day Lewis pick this one? category).<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne as Marius deserves a best-supporting actor nomination. He really owned the character of Marius - a character I never before found to be even slightly interesting. Redmayne brought that character to life and showed a dimension to Marius that you do not take away from the stage production.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is one of my favorite actors and he brought out a different side to Javert than is portrayed in the stage production. Crowe's Javert was less of a dark villain, and more of a man whose soul is imprisoned by his own rigid view of the world. There was a vulnerability in Crowe's eyes that I had not seen since L.A. Confidential, and it softened this portrayal of Javert, so that one was able to empathize with him and feel that he was trapped into this world where he only sees things as good and evil, right and wrong. It was simply a beautiful acting job, and I thought his voice was perfect for the complexities of the character.<br/><br/>Lastly, George Blagden as Grantaire, the young revolutionary with the dark curls and the sweet face; I had never seen him before, but he truly stands out in this movie as taking a small role and turning it into a memorable part. His talent in this film portends a great future."

","I didn't quite know what to expect of the film. I never had the luck to catch the musical; I knew a few well-known tunes but nothing of the story.

Do yourself a favour and watch it.<br/><br/>I later went to do my research and saw enough videos to say I've ""seen"" the entire musical's worth of content off the Internet. I cannot deny that the actors do not sing nearly as well as the professionally trained vocalists, and I found Hugh Jackman's tendencies to half-speak many of the words supposed to be sung to be a little unnecessary. While it works amazingly in several instances, it takes away from the musical phrasing of his numbers in a way that distracts me - though I also know many who absolutely loved his performance.<br/><br/>I applaud the movie for being extremely faithful to the source material. The acting was all-round great, and the attention to details in the setting and costumes were phenomenal. This is, I feel, where the movie shines in a way the musical could not. In a film setting, the performers are no longer limited to the stage and props. The grandeur of many of the set-piece moments was brilliantly brought out with the help of great settings and CGI, while it would have been left to your imagination if you were watching a musical.<br/><br/>I loved the music and the characters even though I couldn't even quite catch some of the French names that came left and right, and there were so many goosebumps moments and moments that give me the urge to give the SCREEN a standing ovation.<br/><br/>It is apparent that many of the negative reviews are unfounded, and many of which come seemingly from trolls from the Internet. I think there is little need for elaboration on why and how comments like ""They sang too much"" are hardly legitimate criticisms.<br/><br/>This is by far my favourite movie of 2012, if not for the Hobbit (I am a Tolkien fanboy), and I would name it my favourite movie of all time, if not for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (I told you so)...<br/><br/>I cannot express adequately how amazing the experience was and I really think that everyone should watch the film if they are able to."

","This is an excellent picture. Anne Hathaway steals it, with her solo performance. The one thing that needs saying, that apparently nobody is willing to express is that the actor with the voice most lacking in the cast was Hugh Jackman. <br/><br/>One need only listen to the performance of Colm Wilkenson (whose performance I witnessed on Broadway)as the elderly bishop, to understand what an important difference a masterful voice makes to the role of Jean val Jean. <br/><br/>I have seen this Hugo work in many iterations and without a strong voice in the lead, the drama cannot maintain a top vote. <br/><br/>Yes, it's a matter of business. Hugh (sexiest man alive) Jackman does tend to get the butts in the seats, but at what cost to the greater work.<br/><br/>In my opinion, he should have been dubbed.

"DirectedByBrian","8","1","3","27 December 2012"," Beautiful Music, Shaky Image
","A full-bodied cinematic treatment of the unstoppable Broadway hit. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is perfect. Russell Crowe sounds a little like he wishes they had lowered his songs by a couple of keys, but is otherwise strong as the embodiment of the Law, Inspector Javert. Anne Hathaway bravely lets the make-up department rob her of all her beauty and drag her interpretation of Fantine into utter despair, but Samantha Barks seems to have insisted that Parisian street urchins like Eponine can manage to look like skin care models while surviving poverty-stricken Parisian winters.<br/><br/>No expense is spared on costumes and sets, and the complications of having actors sing their roles live instead of pre-recorded was worth the results of some very emotional solos - some of which could have benefited from the occasional cut to a different angle.<br/><br/>And thank goodness they had the foresight to replace the pathetic synthesizers of the original cast recording with full orchestration throughout! The music for the film is everything it should have been 20 years ago - and some orchestration is even altered better to reflect the emotions of the moment, such as some very ominous undertones shortly before a key character's suicide.<br/><br/>With all this lush production value, it's a shame someone kept poking me at regular and extended intervals throughout the movie, totally distracting me from the emotional impact. Oh, wait, sorry, that was just the shaky-cam. I know, you're going to say it's irritating how much I complain about that, but in terms of concentrating on the movie and totally losing myself in its embrace, ""organic shake"" is to my mind as someone's elbow is to my ribs. I can't help it, it's not something that will ever ""grow on me"" or be an ""acquired taste"". It is something I do - not - like. It ruined several moments of the film for me, period.<br/><br/>Excessive close-ups and fast cutting during ""Master of the House"" deprive us of the joy of watching the Thenardiers go about their pick-pocketing. You can see that it is happening, but the deftness of their methodology is obscured and rendered joyless when that should have been one of the most rollicking moments. It was still more rollicking than any other moment in such a heavy musical, but it lacked the pizazz I was looking forward to.<br/><br/>Throw in some shots that violate the Rule of Thirds and Look-space for no apparent or useful reason - in layman's terms, look for characters' heads so low in the screen something just looks like a mistake instead of a well-framed shot - and I am befuddled by what the director and cinematographer were thinking they were adding to the production value with many of their camera choices.<br/><br/>It's a big movie, crafted with care. I cried a couple of times, so for the most part, it works. But it's not perfect, and I can't say I left ""amazed"" or with any interest in seeing it more than once."

","Having enjoyed several live productions of Les Miserables over the years, I awaited the opening of this film with great anticipation. That being said, if you are unfamiliar with the music and story, I suggest that you do your due diligence before seeing this movie. My partner and I listened to the music from the Broadway production several times, AND we also read several versions of the story line to refresh our memories.<br/><br/>Just as our teachers used to say, sometimes it pays to do your homework! We both thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The outstanding cinematography and attention to detail added a new dimension to the production, and created a far different visual experience than I remembered from the stage production. The cast was absolutely superb! Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne and of course, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were just tremendous. Who knew that these ""Hollywood Actors"" could sing so beautifully! It was also great to see Colm Wilkinson (one of my favourite performers - The Phantom in the Toronto production of Phantom of the Opera)on the big screen.<br/><br/>Thanks for a wonderful and enjoyable Christmas treat."
"zr001","8","1","3","26 December 2012"," Faultless acting, flawed singing
","On the positive side, I thought Hugh Jackman acted brilliantly, as did the rest of the cast. However, the way Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe sang, for example on ""look down/prologue"" was not strong enough to move you and impact you like it does in the West End. Now, I appreciate that the way they constructed the film was to have the actors sing straight into the camera and not to pre-record them, but I think that if they had they could have really given some of the songs a proper punch that would have really got the blood flowing. On other songs, feeling right up close and personal with the actors was special, such as when JVJ is in the first church. I think that this could have been tweaked for maximum impact: to turn up the impact of the real belters that should be loud (prologue) but allowing the more intimate songs to be done the way they were.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway gave a performance I didn't think she was capable of and I think she should be applauded all round. She was Fontein.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron-Cohen was weak, he seemed to be unsure what accent he was actually putting on- it was a bit of a cross of Ali-G and some kind of joke French, which I actually thought was inappropriate and unacceptable for Les Mis. Yes, the inn-keepers are supposed to be funny but I felt Cohen ridiculed the role and made a joke of it. Helena Bonham Carter was her average self, she didn't really act at all she was actually speaking like herself. I come from the same area she does and I know how we speak, and she didn't really make any effort or change to that. Take it or leave it with her really.<br/><br/>Young Cosette was absolutely perfect cannot fault her she sang wonderfully and really looked the part. Seyfried does actually have a wonderful voice which we all know from Mamma Mia! and the harmony on ""heart full of love"" really came to a lovely crescendo.<br/><br/>I'm going to put this on a new line because Eponine was absolutely fantastic, sung beautifully and touched everyone- there were no loudness (or, really, clout) issues with her (as with Jackman and Crowe)- she was just right.<br/><br/>I would like to have seen the blonde student (not Marius) with longer and straighter hair but that is my preference for the character, he was good enough. Marius also did enough but neither of them made you think ""wow"". At least they had the punch it needed on ""red, the colour of angry men"".<br/><br/>Visually speaking, I thought the sets were wonderful and I did love that beginning scene when JVJ lifts the flag before he leaves was fantastic. The sets or CGI had that epic feel to them which was required and worthy of Les Mis. I wonder if they could have made the set behind the barricade with the big main window a bit more realistic, because even with suspension of disbelief there was no arguing that it was fake. It wasn't possible to make believe that street actually existed.<br/><br/>I've seen better gavroche's.<br/><br/>The final seen when JVJ dies was very moving and did bring tears to my eyes: the movie was woven together well at the end with the effect it was meant to have.<br/><br/>Overall then, there were some extremely strong performances (Eponine, young Cosette, Anne Hathaway) some good performances (Amanda Seyfreid) some mundane ones (the students, Helena B-C) and some inappropriate and undermining ones (Sacha Baron Cohen) which actually detracted from the movie. The singing could have been far stronger at points- on the songs where loud and specifically strong renditions are needed, but the acting was excellent, especially Hathaway and Jackman, the former giving the performance of her life that she probably didn't even know she was capable of. There were some beautiful moments, when the main characters were singing at about three different points (Heart full of love, when JVJ dies...) and I thought the sets overall worked though behind the barricade was a bit too fake looking.<br/><br/>I think that it was a nice thing to bring it to the cinema and I think they got about 80% of it right, but there was certainly tweaking to do. I like the fact they made the characters sing live, but I think they could have post-produced some of the songs that needed the extra punch. Indeed, perhaps it was the fact the camera was right up close and the director was going for an in your face approach at times which may not have worked for when we needed Jackman in the beginning to give us the feelings JVJ had. They could possibly have cut the scene in the middle when Jackman is with Seyfried in the carriage leaving their house, it carried on a bit too long. Also, Seyfried was a bit of a boring choice for the role I would like to have seen a fresh face for it. As I said, Eponine was fantastic. So, in conclusion, some characters (Eponine) were far stronger than others (Baron-Cohen) and they did get 80% of it right, but a few tweaks would need to be made to get it 100%, which I have mentioned throughout and in summary in this paragraph. Perhaps if the format takes off they will be learning and improving on it each time. I think they need to work on the interaction between the camera and the actors/set if they really want to get it right on one hand, and on the other make sure they get the right actors."
"mistymountain","10","1","3","26 December 2012"," Oscar Contender!!!!!!!!
","I'm giving this movie 10 stars even though Russell Crowe sucked as Javert. Hugh Jackman was the main highlight as the protagonist, Jean Valjean. Anne Hathaway really brought Fantine's character to life. Amanda Seyfried did her best as Cosette. For the humorous side, you had funny man Sacha Baron Cohen(Borat, Bruno, Ali G, etc.)as the innkeeper, and Helena Bonham Carter as his wife. ""Master of the House"" was the BEST here in the movie version of the Broadway musical. Hugh Jackman's portrayal is completely genuine and emotional. Russell Crowe's unimpressive last song in the movie took messy end. The stage version of his ""dive"" was much better. And if you look carefully, Colm Wilkoxon, who played the bishop in the movie, was the original Jean Valjean in the stage musical. Wilkoxon represented Ireland in 1978 in the Eurovision Song Contest. Overall, this movie grabs your attention from start to finish. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD. I'd definitely see this movie again, although next time in the morning, because night shows cost almost 12 bucks a pop."
"AndersonWhitbeck","10","5","36","27 March 2013"," Moral Masterpiece
","Universal's Les Miserables is a moral masterpiece. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman deserved and got top billing in this film version of the legendary Broadway success. Jackman becomes Valjean. Oscar Winner Russell Crowe and Oscar nominee Helena Bonham Carter are brilliant, and indeed the entire ensemble cast.<br/><br/>One should note that Valjean is turned into a moral human being by the actions of a Catholic priest who notes ""our guest of honor"" and when Valjean steals the Silver and is returned to the monastery, the Priest refuses to press charges but says it was a gift and indeed includes two candelabra that feature in the film at the end. Thus Valjean becomes the moral force of the movie during the Revolution. <br/><br/>Splendid songs and Anne Hathaway deserved her Oscar for her memorable I Had A Dream, and the ending of the film when Valjean is about to Die and has his daughter and son in law with him Hathaway re appears to guide him to Heaven, and one sees a startling scene of Valjean's body in a chair but his spirit walking towards Heaven. <br/><br/>Great movies have great endings and the soaring end of this fine film is one of the best I have seen in the many films I have seen in my life.<br/><br/>Les Miz should have won the Oscar."
"markgorman","4","2","10","13 January 2013"," Awful. Turgid and mawkish. (Except for Anne Hathaway who is outstanding.)
","I've seen Les Mis twice on stage. It's too long. Fact. <br/><br/>But I was interested in what would happen on screen and hoped that Tom Hooper's horribly fussy direction of the King's Speech would not follow him into this. <br/><br/>I hoped but my wish was unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper puts the blown into overblown in everything he does. The Damned United wasn't a patch on the book, The King's Speech is simply the most overrated movie of the past few years and this, well put it this way, if Anne Hathaway hadn't been in it I'd have been asking for my money back.<br/><br/>Let's deal with the positives first (shouldn't take long). Anne Hathaway's performance as Fantine is mesmerising, especially in her death scene at the end of the first reel. It's a shame because the movie dies with her. And it's all the more remarkable that Hooper will have two Oscar winning performances under his belt from two lousy movies. As I said; remarkable.<br/><br/>In places (Hathaway's death scene in particular) the hand held camera work with a LOT of focus pulling (necessary because of the narrow depth of field and low light works magically. It's incredibly intimate, yet at others it's just plain annoying (and repetitive).<br/><br/>Next, the sound. I could hear every lyric from start to finish which meant that, unlike the stage play, it was easy to follow the (turgid and unlikely) story easily.<br/><br/>But the sound is actually one of my biggest gripes. Yes it was brave, and in parts very good (Hathaway again) to make the actors perform the numbers for real but by focusing on clarity of audio the incidental sound had to be dropped with the result that almost the entire movie sounded like it had been recorded in a recording studio and consequently appeared entirely fake.<br/><br/>Now the rest of the bad news.<br/><br/>The sets are horrible. Entirely unconvincing from start to finish.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is unbearable to watch (his singing voice is unlistenable).<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is appalling, but not as bad as the double act that is Helena Bonham Carter (surely her worst performance ever) and Sacha Baron Cohen who just plain sucks.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne left me totally cold but I'm sure the ladies will like his boyish good looks. But nah. He sucks too.<br/><br/>The direction is mawkish in the extreme which makes the child parts nauseous and heavy handed.<br/><br/>I could go on but I don't want to bore you and I know that nobody will like this review on IMDb because nobody likes critical reviews on IMDb. Ah well."

"adromew","3","1","4","25 July 2019"," -insert Les Miserables pun here-
","What is everyone talking about?? We've got people who hate the movie because it was all sung? That is how the musical was written and let's face it, there are PLENTY of other reasons to dislike this movie. I have seen Les Miserables on stage probably nearing 10 times. This movie brought the set pieces and the theatricality to life but the music and the choice to record the singing live ruined it for me. The music has enough emotion and the actors are good enough that they don't need to sing-act. I'd much prefer the singing and music to be perfect than to have a little more ""emotion"" in the scenes.<br/><br/>To preface: I think all of the actors could have done much better had their singing been pre-recorded and produced separate from the acting and then they can act to their singing. I think they deserved better.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman - great actor, mediocre singer. I've heard him live and let's just say that I'm glad he has his charisma, great acting, and general good-guy-ness.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe - did someone stick something into his nose before he sang? Why is every note seem to be bypassing his nose? I agree with some reviews that say perfect persona for this role but holy cow...please stop singing.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks - NEEDS MORE CREDIT. She is the only trained Broadway/West End actor in this production and it shows. I believe she was actually playing this role on the West End when she got chosen for the movie. Her singing is amazing and her acting is great.<br/><br/>Everyone else...I don't really remember and it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Don't agree with me? Look up Colm Wilkinson/Ramin Karimloo/Alfie Boe as Valjean, Philip Quast and Norm Lewis as Javert, and/or any of the original Broadway or London cast recordings. You'll see how the music can move you without the ""live recordings""."

","I love musicals, and Les Miserables is my all time favorite. I've seen it 10 times in the theater, and listened to the CDs for years. I just can't get past four horribly cast people. Russell Crowe was horrific as Javert. Javert is an amazing part, and he was wooden and most egregiously, he can't sing the amazing songs Javert has to sing. Sacha Baron Cohen was miscast as Thenardier. Thenardier doesn't have to have perfect singing. But Cohen lacked the personality needed. Helena Bonham Carter also was poor here. Singing and wrong personality for Madame. Anne Hathaway is also a decent actress normally, but she lacked the chops for acting and singing for Fantine. Beyond that, decent movie."
"dbirkwood-01970","7","1","4","31 December 2018"," Shame about the box office taking being more important than the casting
","It broke my heart that they had cast box office 'names' rather than talented singers in the lead roles of Cosette and Javert. Amanda seyfried sounded so high pitched, as though she had been on the laughing gas and Russel Crowe's voice lacked any strength and passion. It's especially sad when I have seen those roles performed on stage on numerous occasions and always sung so beautifully and yet when it comes to casting, those actors are overlooked. Very sad."

","With so many talented actor/singers in this world why make a movie with people who cannot sing. Sorry, but the point of a musical is music with singing so why cast actors who struggle to carry off each and every song. Performance crimes of weak voices, flat voice and parodies of emotion. I am perplexed by the praises but the majority always perplexes me in their choices. I put this in the same barrel of rotten apples with the nauseating Sweeney Todd starring boring, over used Johnny Depp. How sad that in the pursuit of comedy they overcooked the master of the feast characters and scene to the point of not funny. Yes, talented people they may be but not for a musical. Like the comedian who longs to do a serious role and the serious actor who longs to 'make 'em laugh', are these wanna be frustrated musical actors? No, just actors who cannot sing, carry a tune or have any power of performance of voice. Guess this is another movie fad. Put rotten singers in musicals. My opinion, don't waste your money or time."
"jackasstrange","9","1","4","4 December 2013"," Hands down one of the best musical films ever made, the very first masterpiece of this decade
","Stole in the Oscars and Snubbed by some critics. Ah! What they are thinking? This film is almost flawless, best of 2012 as far as i am concerned. The cinematography was OK, but the art direction really was top notch. The acting, in a cast overall, the best in a long while. The plot maybe hard for some to follow, since that it's all singed, as an opera. But it's terrific anyways. <br/><br/>I was inclined to say that this film is entirely perfect after my first watching, but now i realize that it's not. But yes, the first one hour is perfect. Period. Denying that will be denying the truth. It's the best first hour ever in a film. You can search flaws on it, but you won't simply find. All the story development was fantastic, and the singing just added a poetry indeed to make it perfect.<br/><br/>The second hour is very good, but not perfect. It had far many performances that just didn't worked for me. Still, they were all really well-made 'numbers'?. Anyways, what really drew my attention in that half was the revolutionizers and their fight to free the France, what brings a direct conflict with the government and the police force, which leads the revolutionizers to their *Spoiler* tragic end. This made me dislike totally the french people, since that they were cowards and choose to do nothing and being enslaved than to help a good cause. Bastards.<br/><br/>Still in that second hour, i liked a lot the cinematography on the war sequences, it just brought an epic feeling to it, which of course, i found awesome! The score is also truly awesome, it looked like it fits much more the war sequences than the normal ones, though. And in fact, it was used much more in 'normal' situations.<br/><br/>And now, a big paragraph to talk only about the cast:<br/><br/>I just find unbelievable how Hugh Jackman didn't won the Oscars in that year. He absolutely was the best actor, and Daniel Day Lewis wasn't all that jazz in Lincoln. Jackman not only brings life,sorriness and the tiredness required for the role of Jean Valjean, but also does it superbly. Few times i've seen an actor so dedicated to a role. I also liked a lot Eddie Redmaine in this film, i've never seen him before anywhere, but he definitely convinced me in this role of Marius. And i became absolutely speechless about Anne Hathaway; she was just phenomenal in the film, one of the best performances by a woman in a musical since Björk in Dancer in the Dark, though Hathaway definitely did a better job. To be honest, it's one of the greatest performances ever. No jokes. I really doubt Hathaway would ever repeat half of the effort she put on Les Miserables. Of course, Amanda Seyfried was very annoying, one of the most cringing voices in the film, if not the most. But she acted well. All the cast did, including the Tarnadiérs infamous hustle couple, being Madame Thernadier interpreted by Helena Bonham Carter and the always hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen interpreting the dirty monsieur Thérnadier. Both were always hilarious when they appeared in the film, despite them being despicable and hated persons in the Victor Hugo's book. And their versions are much better made in the film, i say ya!<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this film just yet... you are losing one of the best films made in the past 30 years! 9.8/10"

","Les Misérables is an epic musical drama based on the musical of the same name by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg which is in turn based on the novel by Victor Hugo. It has an ensemble cast led by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, and Amanda Seyfried. It was written by by William Nicholson, Boublil, Schönberg and Herbert Kretzmer; and directed by Tom Hooper.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who becomes mayor of a town in France. Soon exposed, Valjean agrees to take care of Cosette, the illegitimate daughter of the dying Fantine, but as a fugitive must also avoid being captured again by police inspector Javert. The plot spans 17 years and is set against a backdrop of political turmoil, which in the film culminates in the June Rebellion of France. <br/><br/>This is a big story, with big themes about love, law and revolution in 19th-century France.Hugh Jackman is sensational as zero to hero Valjean. Few can sing, dance and act like him. Here, he combines all three to glorious effect.Despite its multiple Oscar nominations and wins like Anne Hathaway's win for Best Supporting Actress as well as its numerous accolades that it has garnered, it is bombastic, overblown, overlong, needlessly convoluted and full of simplistic characters. No question about it.But it runs too long that - and a half hours - and most of the dialogues are sung that one's big expectations may not be enough to get fully satisfied in it considering it should have been the movie event of the year. Inspite of its imperfections,it still manages to entertain especially loyal fans of the musical."
"tommystans","1","1","4","21 July 2013"," Les Miserable
","I've seen this movie on the plane on my way back from Singapore to Sydney from London and I decided to give this movie a watch and see why everyone love this movie. I've seen the trailer and thought it has that over the top thing with its angles and quality of film and thought it was bad but I wasn't hard on it as it was a trailer and I thought this movie would be, like all musical films, to be having a story with dialogue and then some songs. But this...The entire movie was nothing more then just singing and singing and singing and singing, with a rare part of people talking, that it's just unbearable to watch. The movie felt like a series of songs as I don't even know what the story is about! Granted I haven't read the novel, but I'm not into whatever genre the book is in. <br/><br/>The singing, the only actors that are good at that were the extra characters that played as the poor towns people and Anne Hathaway. However Russell Crowe is just awful he is no Pavarotti to me the movie feels like that it needs big name actors like him to make this movie a success. Hugh Jackman's singing, it's a little better then Russell Crowe's but it's not the best. <br/><br/>As I stated before I haven't read the novel, but I don't even understand the story. What is the story? It's just a series of songs. Plus I find it very ridiculous of how Hugh Jackman's character manage to lift a huge mast from a boat off the ground by himself! It was just unrealistic of him to do that as that would've weighed how many tons! <br/><br/>I know it's a musical, but when I see musical films I see the ones like 'Grease' or 'Give My Regards to Broad Street', I know that wasn't a success to some critics but at least that one has a story! Those movies have music numbers and dialogue that make a story and I think the director should've stayed close to the book rather then the musical. Plus I don't understand why in the movie it was set in France and yet all of the characters speak English, that also happened in the 1998 version. I haven't seen the musical but I can tell that the musical has more potential then the actual film. In conclusion, it's overrated, I don't understand the story with the singing and that they could've chosen better actors then big name ones. They should've called this 'Les Miserables: The Musical Movie'. <br/><br/>However I do think Anne Hathaway is a good singer in this movie, so that is my only positive criticism about this movie. But that won't make me change my opinion about the entire film."
"TxMike","Null","1","4","12 June 2013"," Wonderful movie, brought tears to my eyes.
","Before I sat down to see this one I had seen an earlier filmed version, and I knew the basic story. But I have never seen a stage version of it, nor am I a Les Mis ""fanboy."" I took it for its own merits with no preconceived notions. Well maybe one, I had heard that Russell Crowe was an abomination. I was very happy to find that not only to be untrue, he actually did very well. He is not the lyrical singer that, say, Jackman is, but Crowe always sings on-pitch, and his somewhat unrefined voice actually fits the character he plays.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, of course trained and successful song and dance man, is Jean Valjean. And his nemesis for life is played by Russell Crowe as Javert . What makes this story so remarkable is that Valjean and Javert are more alike than different. Both of them want to be honorable men, but with different approaches.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Anne Hathaway, as Fantine , sings the famous ""I Dreamed a Dream."" It has been well publicized, the songs were not recorded in a studio but actually sung by the actors live, as the scene was being acted and filmed. There have been many beautifully sung renditions, but Hathaway's version is more acting with good singing thrown in, and it really touched me. <br/><br/>The only poor singer in my opinion is Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. Now I like Seyfried, as an actress, but as she demonstrated in ""Mamma Mia"" and now in ""Les Mis"", she desperately needs training to learn how to control her voice and sing well. She has a natural, rapid, shallow vibrato that makes anything she sings cringe-worthy. <br/><br/>Also Eddie Redmayne as Marius and Samantha Barks as Éponine were revelations to me. I had seen Redmayne in several movies and knew he had acting chops, but he is a wonderful singer, and Barks, in her big break, is so much better than Seyfried that she actually made Seyfried sound even worse than she is. <br/><br/>I know it is a very long movie, a bit over 2 1/2 hours, but I didn't really want it to end, I was enjoying it so much."

Russel Crowe should stick to acting because a singer, he is not. Apart from that it was otherwise a spectacular event, especially Fantine's downfall. Other scenes were excellent, such as in the sewers and at the barricade. It was a surprise to see Colm Wilkinson in the very minor role of Bishop. He was a brilliant Jean Valjean in the stage version. Another surprise was Sacha Baron Cohen as Thenardier, a change from roles such as Borat, The Dictator, etc. My preference for this movie would have been for the traditional mimed singing to give a far superior effect."

","Even though this is the best movie I have ever seen I am disappointed with the DVD. Thsi is a spoiler alert, I would like a response. This was the best movie I ever saw in my life. I could not wait to buy the DVD. $20 is a lot for me to spend. But my husband bought it anyway. We were disappointed that scenes were missing and we felt it impaired the characterization of the movie. Why is there 30 min missing on the DVD? Is it the same on the blue ray edition? Is there someone we can contact? Has anyone else noticed the missing parts? I feel that if you pay for it you want the whole picture. There is no mention anywhere on the cover that anything is missing."
"galadriel-elanor","9","1","4","3 April 2013"," A musical with heart!
","First things first. If you're going to enjoy Les Mis, you need to leave your cynicism at the door of the theatre. Yes, people don't usually fall madly in love with a single glance, for no good reason. Yes, people don't usually launch into emotional songs as they die. Yes,in real life, no one cries quite as much, or as frequently, or with as little provocation. But this isn't real life. If you can digest that bit, then you can enjoy the spectacle that is Les Mis.<br/><br/>Second - the music. While there have been many supporters of the whole live-singing process, a lot of people have complained that when making a musical, one should hire real singers; that using ""actors who also sing"" meant the songs were far from vocal and technical perfection. To each his own. I freely admit that while the singing was impressive, it wasn't pitch-perfect at several points. But at least for me, that paled in comparison to the level of emotion the songs were able to convey. In 'Valjean's Soliloquy', I felt his helplessness and his conflict; in 'I Dreamed A Dream', I felt Fantine's hopelessness. When Eponine sings 'On My Own', I'll bet any girl between the ages of 15 and 30 would know EXACTLY how she felt. 'Do You Hear The People Sing' made me want to wave a tricolour even though I'm not French. And so on. If it's the heart of a song that matter to you, then that's there in spades.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway was the only cast member who won a (much-deserved) Oscar. She was undoubtedly fantastic. But don't let that fool you. The rest of the cast were equally brilliant - special shout-out for Hugh Jackman (of course - performance of his life!), Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron Tveit & Daniel Huttlestone.<br/><br/>One final note. I don't know when 'emotion' became a dirty word in films. Recently it's become 'cool' to be glib, quirky, disguised and sarcastic. To hell with that.It's refreshing to see a film that goes for broke with honest-to-God FEELINGS, for a change!"
"menotseen28","10","1","4","3 April 2013"," Excellent Remake of a Stage Sensation
","The cast was superb. The voices although Crowe wasn't that strong were exceptionally done. Hathaway blew me away with her performance as Fontine. Jackman was amazing as Val'Jean. They really did an amazing job with the whole feel of the movie as you really felt the gritty and poor lives of the people there. If you cant watch this movie when Hathaway sings ""The Dream I Dream"" and not cry, go have yourself checked for a pulse. I was moved by how well everything was done, coming from seeing the concert and seeing clips on Youtube of the actual stage play, the disaster movie with Neeson that came out around 89 or 90. I pushed very hard for my husband to set down with me and watch this as we both LOVE musicals. He was moved with it as well, and you will catch him humming songs from it when he is looking around on the Internet. He also has the full soundtrack on his mp3 player, the songs are all catchy especially ""Master of the House"" in which Sacha Baron Cohen plays another knock out role. Its my favorite part in the movie. Although, I hope that they make DVDs sturdy because mine is going to have a skip to it where I have worn it out. This is definitely the best musical that I have seen since Across the Universe, it stands out among the rest and has stood strong with the rest of the Broadway musicals turned into movies."
"sascards67","4","1","4","23 March 2013"," I can only give it a 5
","As a big fan of this musical I knew I had to see this film but was put off after hearing about Russell Crowe's singing. I finally went to see it and my fears were correct. I appreciate that Crowe did a very good acting job here but not since Pierce Brosnan in Mama Mia has an actor been so wrongly cast in a musical. Crowe's voice is not terrible but it is not nearly robust enough to handle a rich part like Javert. The rest of the movie was good, not great. It was great to see Colm Wilkinson get a part as the Bishop but using him instead of Eponine in the finale was a mistake. The harmony of Eponine and Fantine singing to Valjean as he is dying is one of the things that make the ending great. Leaving it out was a mistake. I do not plan on buying this on DVD. I'll watch and listen to my 10th Anniversary concert DVD instead."
"aeastham-1","8","1","4","10 March 2013"," From a Male Perspective
","I'll start by saying that I've sat in the second row in a London theatre and watched the original Les Mis and nothing can compare to the energy of the play. However the film does expand on the play and include scenes which better explain parts of the story. At 158 minutes long though it should be able to provide more detail, even if 9 of those minutes are the end credits. I spent the first hour comparing the film to the stage play and eventually realised this was reducing my enjoyment, I just allowed the remainder of the film to wash over and found this a better way to experience the story.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway is excellent as Fantine, she makes the viewer believe she is actually experiencing the fall to the bottom. Hugh Jackman also puts in a star performance, for an instant I thought a different actor had been used to portray Valjean as the slave convict and Valjean as the respectable business man. I was not as impressed with Russell Crowe, he played the part of Javert very woodenly for me. The best performances by far are those of Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Cohen as the utterly reprehensible Thenardier's. Their scenes in the inn are for me the best parts of the film. <br/><br/>I suppose as a male I should mention the eye candy in the film but for once the film makers got it right. The past,particularly the large cities of the past were dirty, squalid places of filth teaming with people covered in muck and suffering disease. The actors here looked like this, even those pure white Hollywood teeth seem to have been yellowed. Although nothing could hide the beauty of Samantha Banks as Eponine. <br/><br/>Some of the CGI work leaves a lot to be desired but don't let that worry you, this film is all about the story and as a musical works so well. There is very little actual speech,almost all the words are sung and said to a background of music. <br/><br/>So if the girlfriend/wife/partner wants to watch this, close the curtains,turn off the light and crank up the volume, it's a good film."
"sgp-12345","9","1","4","5 March 2013"," A Musical Triumph!!
","There are many musicals that have come out over the time in film history, dating back to the 1930's with the phenomenon of The Wizard of Oz to the most recent of ones like Pitch Perfect. The musical movie has really changed over the years, with musicals having overall gone from a theatrical type of feel and vast scenery to now more of an American Idol or Glee feel of a competition of singing. I think about the opening sequence of A Sound of Music compared to something like Pitch Perfect, as I already noted. <br/><br/>Also, musicals have always been a genre of movie that you either really enjoy or don't like much of at all. There really is no in between. The idea of singing as speaking to one another either goes too over the top for people due to the non-realism of it, or you grow to love the songs, and thus, love the characters due to the feelings they are expressing through song. <br/><br/>However, recently though, it seems like the musical movie has started to lose its luster like movies such as Rent or Phantom of the Opera. The musical if you think about it, was one of the major movie genre's going back to the 1960's with movies like The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story. Well, I have to say that with Les Miserables, the movie musical is back for now, and then some!! <br/><br/>For me, the reason that I love musicals, besides that I love music obviously, is that music has an emotion that words can never express. In Tom Hooper's Broadway adaptation of Les Miserables, he nails that emotion immensely!! The characters and cast in this movie are all just beautiful and have so much passion about what they are doing. Hugh Jackman as the lead character Jean Valjean is exceptional! In fact, so much that as much as I love Daniel Day Lewis as an actor, I personally would have given Jackman the Oscar this year for Best Actor. The way that he shows so many different kinds of emotion while singing and carries the the film is just spectacular! Samantha Barks as Eponine also is terrific! She sings with such beauty, and is someone that you can do nothing except root for in the film. Her performance of On My Own alone is sure to send her into more roles in the future. It was Barks who played Eponine in the 25th Anniversary Broadway version, and with the performance, you can understand why. Eddie Redymayne as Marius is also particularly good and Aaron Tveit, like Barks, who is also from the 25th Anniversary cast as Enjolras is great. Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried, though the two weakest links for me in the movie, still are enjoyable to watch. And Sacha Baren Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thernadier's are also great and provide a comic relief to the audience. <br/><br/>But the performance that stands out for me is Anne Hathaway as Fantine. Her Best Supporting Actress Oscar is so well deserved and is one of the more memorable roles I have seen in quite a while. Every scene that she is in is tear-jerking and her rendition of I Dreamed A Dream is just incredible! In fact, for me, when I first watched it, I said, Wow! This may be the greatest song in musical history! But the music like that song is also what makes Les Miserables so strong. From songs as beautiful as I Dreamed A Dream and On My Own to songs as epic as Look Down, Do You Hear The People Sing, and One Day More, the music propels the movie to make it feel like you are in the character's world and also makes it feel like you just started watching. <br/><br/>Now, this is not a movie for everyone. What makes this film different is the fact that the singing is consistent like an opera, even with lots of regular talking into song. Most musicals have spoken dialogue and then songs every few minutes or so. This nearly never lets up with song and due to that, can be exhausting and unrealistic for some, but for others like myself, just powerful and emotional. <br/><br/>Les Miserables is a film that will make you not only cry your eyes out, but also want to stand up and cheer as well. Not only can I not remember that for any musical I have seen, but there are few films that I remember feeling both of those ways, period!! It is a film with so much heart, and just due to that, you appreciate what you are witnessing while viewing it!"
"kaskadaks","8","1","4","21 February 2013"," Not bad, but hurt by casting names instead of great voices
","I've been a long time fan of Les Mis. It's easily my favorite musical, not just on the strength of the story and characters, but also because of the beautiful music, which I've kept coming back to over and over. So I thought it was sad that the first half to a large extent had distractingly mediocre singing, unfortunately especially so in the largest roles of Valjean and Javert.<br/><br/>I don't care much for Crowes timbre and, what might be worse, his expression was quite flat too, perhaps having to focus too much on singing technique and hitting notes, and not leaving enough of his attention to naturally act through the music. Now I know he's a great actor, and often enjoy his films, but trying to sing on this level while acting was clearly too much of a challenge and both aspects of the performance left much to be desired.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly like Jackman's timbre either. Perhaps he was often straining due to the range. Imagine singing on the edge of or out of your comfortable range for hours day after day. It's got to hurt your voice. Or maybe that's just the way he sounds, I haven't heard enough of other material with him to be able to tell. Also, I really don't like the talk-singing. Perhaps they got carried away and overdid it due to the novelty of the live singing. The director will certainly also have to take some of the blame for that bit though. In any case it didn't make the songs better to more or less ditch the melody here and there. I'll confess I thought Jackman's acting was good though, when I wasn't too distracted by the less impressive singing.<br/><br/>It was an odd thing during the first half, when even some of the dissonant ""ugly"" songs almost felt musically more appealing due to having better singers, than some of the main numbers sung by the two biggest roles. Lots of minor roles were actually really good, and the smaller main roles were also decent, or even great, as with Barks, Redmayne, and what's-his-name playing Enjolras.<br/><br/>I can't blame neither Crowe nor Jackman for wanting the parts - who wouldn't want to be there if they had the chance? But casting them in these roles was a mistake and this simple thing is in my opinion what hurt the film the most. Names instead of voices. Imagine casting a couple of unattractive people as the leads in a rom-com, or a scrawny nerd as an action hero. It will hurt the film no matter how good they act or how good the rest of the material is. It just doesn't work, and neither did this. Musicals need really really strong singers in their proper range so that the music can enhance the experience of the story, not distract from it.<br/><br/>I think it's also a bit sad that the orchestrations were often so low. Les Mis has some lovely themes and I missed some of that. Also, with the instruments low it places even greater demand on the quality of the singing.<br/><br/>But it finally picked up getting into the second half at Red and Black, and was for a while really nice - number after number of beautiful music and acting, with lovely visuals. Imagine if the whole film had been like that! What a magical experience it would have been. I was just a little bit disappointed that they shortened A Little Fall of Rain. It was quite a highlight with two of the best singers and yet they chopped it for what, to save a few seconds? Then along comes Valjean again, poor Jackman straining out of his range in Bring him home.<br/><br/>That they didn't lower it is just nuts. There's no way he compares vocally to the likes of Wilkinson or Boe, and they took enough liberties with the material anyway, so why not just lower it and give him a fighting chance? After that it was a very mixed bag. Hathaway had a nice voice though, when she wasn't sobbing all over herself, and the final numbers did get to me as they always do.<br/><br/>Visually I thought it was pretty decent, not as bad as I'd feared based on some critique. But then I was in the last row expecting a lot of close ups, so maybe that saved me. And the sets and clothing etc were well done.<br/><br/>Overall I'll give it an 8, being a fan, and thanks to the strength of the source material and the quality of most of the second half. Usually I prefer the first half, but that's when the Valjeans and Javerts are top notch singers. If they had been in this version, and if the orchestra was more prominent, I'd likely go see it at least once or twice more while it plays - and drag people with me. Now... probably not. So to sum it up, it wasn't bad, but nowhere near what it could have been, which is sad, as there are so many of us who don't have reasonable opportunities to see it on stage."
"th3-voice","5","1","4","6 February 2013"," Beautiful, but incomplete
","I really like this musical, and I was excited about this movie... thus I was prepared for the possibility of disappointment. After seeing it, these things stood out.<br/><br/>The ""our guys really sing on-set, for reals"" thing is a detriment. Scenes that could be shown as happening during the songs are instead put in between them, to make room for close-ups of faces dwelling on long syllables - poor use of the toolkit at a movie maker's disposal.<br/><br/>Crowe is perfectly fine as Javert. He is no great singer, but I think he performs well.<br/><br/>Biggest dislike: I hate Cohen's Thénardier, but I am unsure as to whether or not this the fault of Cohen's performance or the director/writers - as Thénardier's role has been amputated, crippling it completely.<br/><br/>What makes him effective in the stage version is how he starts out amusing, yet in the (cut) song ""Dog eat Dog"" shows how much of an absolute monster he is - initially a somewhat affable crook, there is something thrillingly horrid about the his glee as he pulls the gold-filled tooth of a fresh corpse in the sewers, his mocking disdain for those who died for noble goals while he himself urged them on. The movie scene fails to convey the true blackness of his heart, thus he remains a comedy villain, robbing the story of a major element.<br/><br/>I also, to an extent, resent the movie for not taking the opportunity to make Cosette and Marius' love story interesting. I will gladly accept the ""love at first sight"" thing, but the two of them are uninteresting. <br/><br/>Eponine and Fantine are both very well performed and inspire the very empathy they are ""supposed to"", in my opinion. Job truly well done.<br/><br/>The few seconds saved by cutting a verse of ""Castle on a Cloud"" were NOT worth it. The song is already tiny... why cripple it, too?<br/><br/>This may be an odd and ""reverse"" sentiment, but I don't think the movie was too long - or at least, that the things that were left out/cut were at every turn the wrong things. To summarize, then, a collection of OK- to-great performances very poorly sewn together."
"valentinomita","6","1","4","28 January 2013"," A simple critic
","I have read the book years ago, but i did not have any expectations from a Hollywood movie to be accurate with it. So for me this was not a reason to not watch and not like this movie. <br/><br/>What is wrong with this film is simple: Russell Crowe has a nice voice but did not match at all with his character; How can you sing about something bad with an angelic way? He was bad as well playing his role making the bad guy...<br/><br/>The film was too long, and the songs needed that something more to give this 'magic' to the audience, except a track that you could hear during the whole movie which makes the difference. Also a musical film does not mean that all the characters should sing all the time (which made this movie really boring) while its not needed at all, they could talk as well... <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway was amazing and really emotional, and even if her role was really small she was still big. Hugh Jackman proves one more time how great actor he is.<br/><br/>Simple!"
"love_for_nails","8","1","4","27 January 2013"," Not Victor Hugo, not the truly Les Miserables, but very good and inspiring in it's own way!
","Now, don't get me wrong people, I'm not a purist ""Les Miserables"" book nerd or a musical hater. Not at all in any meaning, so you can scroll your eyes peacefully through this review. It will be a kind of a long review but I hope that some of you will find the patience to read thoroughly in order to understand the idea. I feel the need to point out as an avid reader and as an admiring and respectfully reader of Victor Hugo that no adaption did capture by now the complex essence of Victor Hugo's work (that's NOT a bad thing) nor I do think it will ever capture, unless a very long TV series will be made. In a movie or musical you can capture only bits of what this story wants to communicate to the public.I know that probably some of the viewers can get easily intimidated by the amount of pages and informations the book preserves, I really hope some of you will find the patience to read the book, it's worth your time.<br/><br/>And now for this adaptation. This and the 1998 version are the only so far adaptations I have watched until now. The ones that impressed me were not Anne Hathaway, not Hugh Jackman although he did a good job but non-other than Russell Crowe for whom I expected the biggest disappointment and the utmost failure as I didn't saw him as a great actor (sorry but this is the truth). But here, in ""Les Miserables"" maybe he was not Javert (he was NOT that Javert at all) but as a little villain he portrayed the character with very much talent and managed to show more of that little side of the tormented and human Javert that we never got to see from the story but we thought about it. And his voice was very good. I admit at some parts I couldn't help not to chuckle when he began singing but he did a very very good job. Even great if I can say that and I totally changed my opinion towards him. I appreciate him very much for his work and I praise Tom Hooper now for his insistence in casting him. He was right for this movie. For this movie, as Geoffrey Rush is and will always be the truly Javert for me. He will always be Javert for me because that was how Javert really was in almost his entire life. But it's good to see Russell Crowe's Javert too, no doubt.<br/><br/><ul><li>Hugh Jackman did again a very good job, as well, as Jean Valijean though I think that his character wasn't developed properly as I almost forgotten him in the scenes were he didn't appear, and that's not good since he is a key character. The only parts were he managed to impress me was when he sung ""Suddenly"" (kind of ironic since this song only appeared now) and at the end when he *spoiler* died *spoiler*.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Samantha Barks was a very good casting choice for Eponine since she already played the character on Broadway, so she was familiar with the role and did a great job. Nothing more to say about her, but honestly now, Eponine it's not actual a key character. While she has a pretty large role in the book, she is not a key character and her story arc is not very important, but nonetheless romantic and sweet for others. In the 1998 version everybody bemoaned her absence and love triangle with Marius, but that version wasn't supposed to be romantic and her part would have been nothing but a villain who tries to ruin Cosette's life after she settles down for a while, and not a tragic character. It was for her image sake to not be included and I respect that choice and consider it very wise. Remember the Gerard Depardieu version where she is actually portrayed as it's said a bit mean and selfish.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Aaron Tveit was truly amazing as Enjorlas. He was the perfect handsome and patriotic young man that the adaptations will have in my opinion. I loved Aaron's performance, I was very impressed by his Enjorlas and his power and strenght of how he fought to the very end. He is the main hero of the June's Rebellion and Aaron did justice to his character. Congratulations!<br/><br/><ul><li>And Anne Hathaway. Here is my little problem. I'm not a hater, I respect her very much for her work and devotion toward this movie, but I felt that she did too much for the part. It's not really about cutting her hair and losing pounds but with all Fantine's sad and tragic story I couldn't manage to connect with her and feel sorry for her. And again, as I mentioned with Hugh Jackman, maybe her character wasn't developed properly for this version too. Anne Hathaway while she indeed managed to express the miserable life and feelings of Fantine she still missed something very important from what defined Fantine, and for which I apologize but can't describe. She was great but I'm really really sorry, she tried to much. She doesn't deserve the Oscar for her performance, but maybe she deserves it for the hard-work and sacrifices she made for the role.</li></ul><br/><br/>As for the production, it was very interesting but lacked certain things again for which it got a black mark. The story wasn't developed properly, that was the main flaw for sure. I couldn't connect with the characters nor feel emotions towards their situations. I felt everything was rushed but knowing the story I don't complain. But for those unfamiliar with the story it's very hard to understand. The only part that captured me and impressed me was the revolution. The revolution was the most exciting and beautiful part of the whole movie. I think it expressed perfectly the feelings and the miserable situations of the people back then.<br/><br/>8/10"
"lisarrowe","5","1","4","25 January 2013"," Good for a musical
","Russell Crower should not have been allowed. He belongs in back street brawls, not in musicals. Anna Hathaway does a good job of being miserable, quite fitting, as does Hugh Jackman, as many people say he was born for the stage - hell, he looks like he was. But Russell Crowe? He should never have gotten an invite. Performance was lacking of any emotion aside from anger, as he is apt to with his record of bag-slinging bar fights.<br/><br/>Honestly, there was so much emotion, but Russell Crowe does not fit the bill.<br/><br/>The movie fits the artistic bill. But why would Hooper choose Crowe? He adds nothing."
"wbeeman","7","1","4","21 January 2013"," Great Actors, Poorly Trained Singers
","I enjoyed seeing the film of Les Miserables, having seen the stage show several times. Film is hyper-real, so questions arise that never come up in the stage show. The events of the novel and the film take place during the 1832 June Rebellion not the First Revolution (1789-99) as many Americans might assume, but Hugo's novel was also influenced by the Revolution of 1948 which deposed Louis Philippe. Victor Hugo hated the monarchs of the time and the novel (and the show) exaggerates the bad social conditions of the time. <br/><br/>But the main problem for me was unfortunately the singing. The work is effectively an opera with almost no spoken dialogue. The music is a huge part of the emotional appeal of the work, and the actors--great as they are--make one of the great mistakes of singing. Rather than letting their voices convey emotion, they emote first, then sing. They obviously don't know the difference, and it is a very significant one. Since they were singing virtually a capella on the actual set of the movie under extremely strenuous physical conditions I can empathize with their limitations, but the director's method here, though bold, robbed the movie of much of its emotional impact. <br/><br/>Then there are some, like the great Russell Crowe, who sadly, just don't have the chops. Javer's fabulous ""aria,"" ""Stars"" fell flat in Crowe's safe but bland rendition. Javer's enormous conviction sets up his later suicide, and Crowe couldn't bring it off. Sad. <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway grinds her way through ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and robs us of the emotion inherent in the music. Susan Boyle brought me to tears. Anne Hathaway made me admire her grit and physicality, but it was not her singing that created the much more limited emotional response I felt. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has the singing chops, but his big ""aria,"" ""Bring Him Home"" is the graveyard of many stage Jean Valjeans. It is horribly high in tessatura, and Jackman was almost screaming to get out the high notes. The song says, ""hear my prayer"" and it was not a prayer, but a shout. <br/><br/>These are all great actors, but the direction was off-base here, and audiences who never saw the stage work will never know how affecting it can be if they only see the movie."
"advictoriam","8","1","4","20 January 2013"," A solid adaptation of Les Mis from the stage to the screen.
","It is important to note that this review is from the point of view of someone whose favourite musical of all time is Les Mis. I went into the theatre on Christmas day being extremely familiar with the story- I studied the book in French, saw the 1998 movie, saw versions of the stage musical, and have seen both the 10th and 25th anniversary concerts.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie was spectacular. In particular, the opening scene was incredibly well done. The costumes and the set were superb, and I have no complaints about the lighting and cinematography. Although this movie has a runtime of approximately 2.5 hours, it does not drag, and is carried along by the musical numbers.<br/><br/>For those who are unused to musical theatre, the ""constant singing"" may come as a surprise. For others, it is a relief that the music is retained and is not converted into dialogue. This movie takes pride in the fact that it is 'sung live' and not pre-recorded, in order to make it feel meaningful and raw. Kudos to the director for this- it really helps maintain the spirit of musical theatre. However, some of the actors were incapable of fulfilling the vocally demanding roles that they were called to fill. Others presented solid performances.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was decent in the role of Valjean. His acting was terrific, and the singing was good overall. The only song I had significant issues with was his rendition of 'Bring Him Home' which lacked the tenderness and flowing quality of Colm Wilkinson or Alfie Boe's versions. The powerful notes sometimes had a screechy quality which detracted from the emotion in the scene.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway has been heaped with praise for her role, and rightfully so. She adapted the stage version of Fantine to the Fantine on screen flawlessly, and demonstrated why Les Mis was made into a movie; the intricacy of her acting and the raw passion of her vocals worked excellently in the scene. However, her version worked due to the fact that the song is, plot wise, at slightly different- but extremely significant- locations between the stage musical and the movie. Hence, her raw and heartbreaking rendition is appropriate, whereas in the stage musical, a vocally powerful and slightly more hopeful version is usually done.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe was the least suited for his role as Javert. Vocally, his voice sounded muffled and emotionless, and his songs were forgettable. He wasn't particularly redeemed by his acting, either.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried was vocally unsuited for the role. The character of the grown Cosette is one that is fairly one-dimensional to start with, but managed to fall even more flat in the movie. Her soprano voice is without substance, and her vibrato is shaky; hence, she had difficulties showing what emotion her character had through her singing.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne did a good job, as did Aaron Tveit, and Samantha Barks.<br/><br/>Overall, I was happy with the way Les Mis was translated from stage to screen. The story was told with care and conviction, and I was brought to tears multiple times. The casting could have been better; it was an excellent idea to cast Samantha Barks, who was in the stage version, and Anne Hathaway was also fantastic. Although I will stick to my 25th and 10th anniversary soundtracks, the movie itself is one that I can see myself watching again."
"Taliska","5","1","4","20 January 2013"," So disappointed - sound was poor
","I don't usually write reviews, but this film was so disappointing for me that I felt the need to write about it.<br/><br/>The sound was the one aspect, in my humble opinion, that totally blunted my enjoyment of the film - after one minute of it starting I went out and asked the management at the cinema to check that there wasn't a fault with the sound equipment.<br/><br/>You have an 'all surrounding' advert saying how good the sound is in the cinema, and then the soundtrack is 'all at the front' like some ancient film from the last century. There are a few sound effects that then inappropriately pop out at the sides and back, and the finale suddenly surrounds you at the end. Aarrgghh.<br/><br/>I am so sad - I really like the musical, and this was poor in comparison. I don't feel the need to say anything much about Russell Crowe - a poor casting decision (Sorry, Russell, I know you tried).<br/><br/>Will have to get the Blu-ray when it comes out and get the DSP on the amplifier to do its best to bring some life to it."

","It will be a huge injustice if Hugh Jackman does not get an Oscar for this role. He was amazing. The supporting cast were also brilliant with not one weak link. The emotion and feeling from the actors was tangible. Russell Crowe was perfect casting for Javere, a man dedicated to carrying out his duty to the end. Anne Hathaway as Fantine was vulnerable but showed a mother's strength and determination to care for her daughter no matter what depths her life sunk to. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter brought badly needed light relief when most needed as the comic pair who had been entrusted by Fantine to care for her daughter Cosette. i think the decision to record the actors singing live was a stroke of real genius and brought this movie to a higher level. Although a long film it was over too soon. I loved it!"
"thcgator","6","1","4","17 January 2013"," Try and make it to the second half ... it does get better.. Jackman does not sing as much
","So went to see Les Mis tonight... I have to say I was a bit disappointed. First let me say that Barks, Redmayne, and Seyfred saved the show for me. Cosette, Marius and Eponine makes the back half of the movie really good. Hathaway as Fantne was very good as well and man she really sacrificed for the part. However that is where the good parts end... it seemed to me that they could not figure out if they should make it look like a theater stage or Paris in many of the scenes. Crowe does an OK job as Javert but you can see he struggled to show any of the emotion of the character and sing his lines. However at least he can sing .... Jackman holds a note as about as well as a colander holds water. He was really the wrong person for the job; they should have looked for a singer who has done some acting rather then an actor that has clearly never had to sing. The part I was most disappointed with is ""Who Am I""; This is a powerful turning point for the character and he just did not have the strength in his voice did not show it ... I might have been ruined since I saw it first in Gainesville from the actual Broadway cast."
"FudgeSquirrel","3","1","4","12 January 2013"," Not bad, but overshadowed by the stage version.
","If you haven't seen the stage performance of Les Miserables, then the film will no doubt be excellent is your eyes. The story has been kept close to the original and portrays several key morals (greed, revenge, etc). However, the good points of the film are taken from before, so in my opinion the film adds no flavour of it's own. Being one who has seen the stage performance of Les Miserables in the West End, I felt slightly disappointed at the film. It was definitely superior than all predecessors big-screen adaptations, but lacked the atmosphere and thrill I was expecting. I leave this down to the lack of climax; the beginning of the film is very moving and Anne Hathaway was extremely good, but the second half didn't gain much momentum and the powerful songs (such as 'Do you hear the people sing?') were done in such a way that I didn't receive chills as I did during the stage version. Apart from that, the fantastic storyline of Les Miserables boosts it's score, alongside the swell performances of Hathaway and Crowe."
"cinematic_aficionado","4","1","4","11 January 2013"," Why I think it is a flop
","So the studios thought they could make a big screen musical, based on a West End theatrical musical to commemorate the 150 years since Les Miserables was first published.<br/><br/>To achieve this, they brought on board some A-listers as well as other known names in the acting profession. Now, had this been a movie or a theatrical venture it would have probably been a different experience altogether but to engage a bunch of non-stage actors into an ambitious 2hr 40min cine-musical was an utter fallacy.<br/><br/>Both the leading characters, played by Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, are great actors but there was nothing memorable about their performances in this film. The introduction to their characters was rushed the acting had no spirit and despite it being a very long film the over focus on singing made the plot rush itself.<br/><br/>The several feel good moments, an area which mainstream Hollywood excels, skilfully covered up the lack of sequence in the narrative where later in the film a soft spoken actor and model (Eddie Redmayne) portrayed a leader or the revolutionary moment. Yes, seriously.<br/><br/>Last but not least the spirit of one of the greatest novels, which allegedly this film is based upon, is simply not there. Compare this with the 1978 version, starring Anthony Perkins or even perhaps the 1935 version with Charles Loughton to see how much the standards have fallen.<br/><br/>I am well aware that I am voice crying out in the wilderness; there is no doubt in me there will be an army of women who will be enthralled to see Crowe and Jackman playing soft and hard singing their hearts out, not to mention Redmayne singing love songs to Seyfried. Expect to hear: ""How touching, what a great movie, I couldn't help weeping."" Undoubtedly, the combination of A-listers, grandeur in the production with the several feel-good moment will induce that effect to many.<br/><br/>The fact is to those of us who are eclectic this is a grand disappointment and to see it competing for Best Picture award with the likes of Amour (2012) or Argo (2012) is bordering the offensive."
"DUKEJBM","Null","1","4","4 January 2013"," I never liked musicals... until now! What an AMAZING and MOVING film!
","First, I have to confess that the only knowledge I had of this legendary tale came through popular culture references. If it wasn't for Star Trek or Seinfeld episodes, I would have known absolutely nothing about Les Miserables. Yeah, I'm THAT guy. I can also say that I never met a musical that I liked or even wanted to give much of a chance. That changes in a BIG way here! <br/><br/>I was completely enthralled and completely moved by this film and the way it was presented. I've read the critiques stating that the direction may be inferior or that the vocals should have been sweetened in post but I find both those criticisms to be without merit whatsoever. The entire cast was superb and there really are some award-worthy performances to say the least. Hugh Jackman is amazing as is Anne Hathaway (although being a novice to the tale, I was surprised at how small her role was). Every actor struck a chord with me emotionally. I honestly didn't expect that to happen. Sure, a person can nitpick the story and the rather instantaneous love and connections that happen between characters but why seek to cheapen the experience? Getting hung up on logic when everyone is singing their thoughts and feeling would be missing the point. The overall message is as grand and moving as the performances. I also have to finish with another confession. It takes a tougher man than I to not tear up at the end of the film. The conclusion hit home in a big way with me as did this film, much to my surprise.<br/><br/>(Note: I usually consider myself in the ""it's not my kind of thing"" category when it comes to musicals. I saw it because of the hype. Five minutes in when Crowe and Jackman are doing their opening sing/speak I thought to myself, ""good lord, this is going to be intolerable."" ""Why the heck did I pay to see this?"" Now, I'm so glad I kept an open mind and allowed the film to do it's thing. This is one of the few 10/10 ratings and experiences for me of the 2012 releases. I enjoyed it FAR more than I thought I would.)"
"srikiraju","9","1","4","3 January 2013"," Shoo away negative reviewers
","All the negative reviews say is that either there is too much music(duh) or the singers were not ""singers"". OK, screw that. All the actors were very good at singing. I couldn't believe that Hugh Jackman was singing that well. He was very well cast. Going up close and focusing on the characters with the camera is different and actually makes the soliloquies that much better.<br/><br/>The only problem I ever had with the entire movie was that Crowe sounded a bit bland in some songs. But other than that, it was an exceptional movie. Damn fine. <br/><br/>Of course this movie isn't for everyone. It's a musical. If you like musicals, this is great."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","5","1","4","2 January 2013"," Maddeningly Uneven
","Years ago I wrote a review of Les Misérables: the Tenth Anniversary Concert where I said there was no way a movie musical could top it. It turns out I was right. The long awaited adaptation of the Broadway musical is a large scale enterprise, but much of the singing falls flat and it suffers from mediocre direction.<br/><br/>Les Misérables is about an ex convict, Jean Valjean, whose quest for redemption challenges traditional notions of morality and justice. The ex convict's life is changed when the Bishop of Digne pardons him for stealing his silver; Valjean, touched by his sympathy, decides to break his parole to start a new, honest life for himself, one where he could be unburdened by his label as a convict. But his life really begins anew when he adopts Cosette, the daughter of one of his factory workers, Fantine. Valjean inadvertently approved Fantine's termination of employment, forcing the single mother to become a prostitute and sell her hair and teeth for money. Taking responsibility for his actions, Valjean rescues Cosette from the sniveling Thenardiers while being pursued by the relentless policeman, Inspector Javert. <br/><br/>But let's get to the musical. Overall, this film is maddeningly uneven. The singing ranges from amazing to downright pitiful. Les Miz has garnered a lot of attention for the decision to have the actors sing live and I think it had mixed results. The group musical numbers like ""One Day More,"" ""Master of the House,"" and ""Lovely Ladies"" work pretty well, but the quality of the solos vary. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, who plays Valjean, is a decent singer and actor but he can't seem to handle high notes. Anne Hathaway is the star of this film- the only cast member who sings as well as she acts. Her very moving rendition of I Dreamed a Dream is the highlight of the film (eat that Susan Boyle). The other cast member to really look out for is Samantha Barks as Eponine. Barks has played the character before on the London stage and her experience shows. Eponine is in love with Marius, a young student who tries to start the next French Revolution, but Marius does not return her affections. Marius, played by Eddie Redmayne, is also a good singer, but his voice sounds a little muppetish at times (you have to see it to know what I mean). Marius's heart belongs to Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) and the feeling is mutual. Seyfried manages to get through her songs, but her voice is very thin. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe as Javert is the oddball of this cast- he doesn't hold a candle to any of the other cast members. This is a character that demands a powerful presence and Crowe just doesn't have it. Casting decisions like this are usually justified for two reasons- the film needs big stars to make a return at the box office and they can emote better than stage actors. The former might be true, but the latter certainly isn't in the case of Crowe. Crowe is a good actor, but he's basically an emotionless zombie in this film. Crowe just falls flat in every scene. <br/><br/>Rounding out the cast are Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baren Cohen as the greedy Thenardiers, who provide some much needed comic relief. <br/><br/>Poor direction is also a large culprit for the film's flat musical numbers. Critics have said this before, but I need to repeat it- someone should get Tom Hooper a better cinematographer. He uses far too many close-ups and amateurish cattycorner camera angles to signify ""danger."" The shoddy camera work turns what should be enthralling musical numbers into very tedious affairs. The movie just lacked dynamism.<br/><br/>Much has also been said of the film's sluggish pacing. At two hours and forty minutes without an intermission, it can be tough to sit through. It feels a bit more like a collection of musical numbers rather than a cohesive story. I'm not sure if this could have been avoided without sacrificing loyalty to the original musical though.<br/><br/>To his credit, Tom Hooper did make some good decisions in reorganizing the order of the songs and incorporating parts of the book to help transition between certain scenes. He gives us a slightly different interpretation of A Little Fall of Rain, a duet between Marius and Eponine, which actually overshadows Eponine's signature song On My Own. *SPOILERS*His decision to include the Bishop of Digne in Valjean's death scene instead of Eponine was pretty smart, since Eponine was not important to him at all. *END SPOILERS* The sets and costumes are all top notch of course, and if the movie wins any more Oscars it should be in these categories. <br/><br/>Some people might see this movie as further proof that musicals just don't cut it in Hollywood, but I still have hope that the genre can make a comeback. Heck, the live singing in this movie worked brilliantly at times. I think part of the problem is nobody has the guts to do a musical properly- they always cast musically ""handicapped"" people like Russell Crowe to draw in crowds. The belief that people just won't like a traditional musical, or that movie actors are somehow better suited for musicals than actual singers has always struck me as a capitulation to fear more than anything. I think with the right music, the right cast, the right script, and the right director, musicals can be as good as ever.<br/><br/>If you want to see a real performance of Les Miz though, just watch the Tenth Anniversary Concert."

","First of all, I've seen the stage production of Les Mis 2 times. First time was about 20 years ago and I sat near the back and fell asleep halfway through. The last time was about a year ago when the production was in the area and I really enjoyed it. Also, in the last couple years I've seen the specials they have like the 25th anniversary one and other clips on you tube. I went into the movie with some high expectations but I realized that these were actors singing. I was curious about Crowe singing since the only clips of him singing on the internet I had my doubts he could handle Javert. I really liked this movie a lot. It had me in tears more than a few times and certainly more than the stage production did. I really liked the little Cosette, she was really cute and liked that she whispered that one line, brought some tears there. Hathaway did a great job as Fantine, but I had seen her in the trailer already so, I was expecting that. I really liked Jackman and Crowe as well. Although their voices were not perfect compared with the stage productions, they were more than good enough for me and the way they sang gave it a more believable tone. I could understand the lyrics better than when I listen to the other versions. I really enjoyed Marius and Cosette meeting for the first time, it gave me goosebumps and Marius was great in the empty chairs song. Overall great movie and I wouldn't mind paying to see it again, or actually buying the DVD when it comes out."

","For the uninitiated, ""Les Miserables"" concerns itself with the lives of 19th century Frenchmen and women dealing with issues as vast as love, redemption, god, hardship, and revolution. The principle yarn involves a former convict named Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who makes a promise to a young lady (Anne Hathaway) to take care of her young daughter after she succumbs to illness.<br/><br/>If bravado and bombast were an award category, I'm sure ""Les Miserables"" would take home the blue ribbon. But while ""Les Mis"" is filled with many, lets say rewarding emotional peaks, the film as a whole suffers from way too much muchness; too many story lines, too many indispensable characters, too many close-ups! Too many sustained moments of cathartic weeping and whimpering, clunking along to the ebbs and swells of Claude-Michel Schönberg's musical score.<br/><br/>This is not to say the makers shouldn't be credited for their hard work. Recording the vocals live instead of in studio must have been exhausting and ultimately did add a little je ne sais quoi to the proceedings, but like the first films in technicolor, the artists behind the camera just didn't know what to do with such techniques.<br/><br/>The story of ""Les Mis"" has been adapted for the big screen more than a dozen times, and will likely be adapted again in the future. Watch it only if you have to, otherwise consider ""Les Mis"" obvious Oscar bait likely to be forgotten by this time next year.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

Yes, there were some good singers, but overall they were pretty average, so it was lacking that bone-chilling note on a lot of songs. I was especially sad with One Day More. That song when done on Broadway makes me shiver, and I just didn't feel that here. but I didn't walk in expecting them to be as great as the Broadway singers. So I wasn't terribly upset. I was actually ecstatic about the fact that I feel like these actors captured the raw emotion of the story better than the Broadway actors did themselves. Ann Hathaway managed to break my heart, and Hugh Jackman did wonderfully. Everyone keeps complaining about Russel Crowe, but personally? I think he did pretty well! He isn't a bad singer!

","Les Miserables is my favorite musical of all time, having seen it nearly 40 times all over the country, I was really afraid that they would not capture the soul of this play on screen. I was presently surprised and was really feeling all the emotions throughout the movie. All actors were great and a real shout out for Samantha Barks who played Eponine, where has this actress been hiding? Her voice is utterly fantastic and she really did a great job of acting. My favorite surprise was the appearance of Colm Wilkerson who played the Priest in this movie version, Colm Wilkerson is known as the ultimate Jean Valjean with a voice that is known as the standard that all others are graded. Most nearly all followers of this musical would agree. The only disappointment to me was the voice of Amanda Seyfried who played Cosette, she seemed to only be able to sing in a very high range that did not always fit well with the scene, but her acting was very good. As a hard core Les Miserable follower, I was very pleased with the movie version and I am happy that many people who have not seen the play, but have heard the music will be able to understand the music better now as they can see the story more clearly. All in all, a must see movie!"
"edb-5","7","1","4","26 December 2012"," Somewhat disappointing
","If you've seen the stage version of this musical, it's unlikely you will find the movie adaptation satisfying. Russell Crowe and Sacha Baron Cohen are out of their depth vocally, and in the case of Crowe, this is a serious shortcoming. Even Hugh Jackman, who I believe is a consummate all- around entertainer, strains with the vocal demands of his role. Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne are lovely as Cosette and Marius, although they project little amorous fire. The smaller roles of Eponine, Gavroche, young Cosette, and Enjolras are very well cast. The editing is unnecessarily choppy, although I know this is the common model of today's filmmaking. There's no question the film is visually sumptuous, but the production never misses an opportunity to hit us over the head with the pathos, as if audiences are incapable of relating to subtlety. It is a sad statement that the appearance of Colm Wilkinson as the bishop makes one long for his performance in the role of Jean Valjean."

Aesthically? Spot on: makeup, set design, costumes, special effect. 
Casting, Blockbuster! Great actors best choices! 
So so much to love about this film! I appreciate good musicals (phantom of the Opera, beauty and the beast, greatest showman, etc.) But this musical...not the actors fault who ever consciously decided that (this) was a good decision was an idiot. Anna Hathaway is a good Singer and a good actor but was forced to sing out of her pitch and cry sing. No one can cry sing and it be anything but a bag of cats. Not her fault
Hugh Jackman was forced to sing every line even the most basic of dialogue that doesn't fit the music. No one does that! Phantom of the Opera had unsung dialogue, name any musical and there is dialogue that cannot and shouldn't be sung.
Amanda Seyfried has a beautiful voice and she was okay I'm this. 
Everyone gives Russell Crowe crap for his singing being flat and monotone but it was in his range and it was perfect. I looked forward to his singing than Anna Hathaway's screeching cats.
But the angel of the whole movie was Samantha barks! Her solo was divine!
I want to love this movie I really do but the conscious decisions on the music experts whatever they're called was amateur and screeching that smears what is actually good about the movie."
"curtis-1","1","1","5","15 August 2017"," Worst movie adaptation of a musical ever
","I love the original musical, but this movie totally botched their casting in hopes of getting names that people would recognize or come to see. This is even worse than The Phantom of the Opera where they booked a Phantom who couldn't sing.<br/><br/>1. Giving the role of the Bishop to Colm Wilkinson (the original Jean Valjean). His voice was good back in the day, but he was clearly no longer up to the task. He spoke most of his lyrics and barely sung the rest. Ruined one of my favorite songs (I have bought your soul for God.)<br/><br/>2. Hugh Jackman as JVJ. He's a great actor and a good singer, but the songs were clearly out of his range. It's a tenor part and he is a baritone. Bring Him Home is supposed to be a prayer spoken over a sleeping boy. He had to do it at fully voice because it wasn't in his range. Totally ruined the beauty of that song.<br/><br/>3. Russel Crowe sucked from beginning to end. Couldn't sing and that's the worst acting job I've ever seen him do. I think he was so worried about the singing he forgot to act. I've cardboard cutouts that acted better.<br/><br/>4. I love Sasha B Cohen, but e he and HB Carter beyond disgusting in their roles. Took comedic relief beyond comedy. Made me want to puke. One could argue that their role was always this gross. I've seen the play this many times and have never been this grossed out.<br/><br/>5. Eddie Redmayne is a great actor but sings like Kermit the Frog.<br/><br/>6. Amanda Seyfried's super trilly vibrato is like fingernails on a chalkboard.<br/><br/>It wasn't ALL bad.<br/><br/>1. Gavroche was good.<br/><br/>2. Anne Hathaway was transcendent and the best part of the movie. Her solo was the most heart-wrenching one I've ever seen. Too bad she dies 10 mins in.<br/><br/>3.

"ElMaruecan82","6","1","5","5 June 2017"," Where's the 'Mute' button?
","I tried. I really tried.<br/><br/>But after a third failed attempt, I guess I'll have to declare myself forfeit. I can't watch ""Les Miserables"" in its entirety not with keeping myself glued to the screen anyway. I'm not sure I would use it as a background noise sorry, I meant music. I love ""The Misérables"" as a story but is the fame so great for the American audience that director Todd Hopper thought a musical would be the best way to boost the audiences or grab the interest. I know it's an adaptation from a Broadway musical, but this is no musical, this is an opera, a loud, bombastic opera where every line is sung as loudly as if the actors' lives depended on it, it comes to such a proportion that there's no purpose whatsoever to have a language section in the Bonus Features and here's why.<br/><br/>The second time I tried to give the film a chance, I put the French version, just for fun, well, what do you know, the songs were kept in the original language so that French was popping up here and there in a few random moments where the characters actually spoke, like ten minutes in a whole, I totally forgot it was in French. That's how ubiquitous singing is, and not just singing, everything is emphasized to the point that you almost feel the pain and the agony of all these talented actors but so-so singers, it's like you witness suffering and despair in motion, and again, it's so omnipresent that there's no moment that can pass as relief, one you could catch your breath. Even the highlight of the film that earned Anne Hathaway her Oscar is diluted in the rest where it's all the same loud and hyperbolic songs. ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is memorable but not a standalone moment because everything else is just the same.<br/><br/>The film had everything, the sets, the decoration, a talented cast, Hugh Jackman did a convincing Jean Valjean and even Crowe could be a decent Javert, I wasn't even shocked by Sacha 'Borat' Cohen as Thénardier whose villainous two-faced creepy role has often been played by comedic actors as to highlight the grotesque clown-looking men, but Todd Hopper's choice to tackle the story through singing wasn't the most inspired. He proved to have succeeded with simpler methods with his ""King's Speech"" which, while not the most flamboyant movie of the year, was still moving enough to catch the hearts of people. Here, it's like the young, and certainly talented and well-intended director, was so wrapped up by his success he wanted his musical. Recently, Damien Chazelle did the same with a better movie, and yet lost to the more modest ""Moonlight"". Sometimes, the fewer, the better.<br/><br/>Musicals are hit-or-miss but while ""Les Misérables"" is a critical success (or was it?), I'm not sure it's the wisest approach to a story that is multi-layered and benefits from regular acting. Take the scene where Valjean meets the priest who saves him from another arrest with the candelabra, this is a quiet and powerful moment between two men, something that should say a lot without an abundance of lines, here they're singing their lungs out and it's totally inappropriate, if not comical. So many attempts on emotions are lost because of this focus on opera and the more you progress in the story, the more you realize it was a bad strategy after all.<br/><br/>Indeed, if people aren't into music and opera, they will not enjoy it, if they do, they'll hate the singing and deem it as amateur and cringe-worthy, a simple glimpse at IMDb's review section will give you an idea. So ""Les Miserables"" belongs to the posterity on a simple Wikipedia-level, but I'm not sure it will have this aura that stands the test of time, and as if it embraced its own malediction, even Anne Hathway wasn't too happy about her win.<br/><br/>The film was obviously made to impress, but I wish it wished to 'express' as well."

","When I was little, Les misérables was a cartoon aired on Saturday mornings, mostly focused on Cosette as a child with Jean Valjean. When I got a little older, I read the shortened version and during the last few years, the full length version was just a book laying around my room that I read passages from when I felt like it. I watched the old movie version a couple of times when it was aired on on one of the six channels I have home. Watching this movie made me realize that I have now a pretty strong emotional attachment for this story. It makes me also aware that I can't imagine the perspective that one who was not previously acquainted with it might have on Hooper's rendition. For me however, every second of it was brilliant. The cast is perfect. I liked Hugh Jackman in general, but I really am in love with him as Jean Valjean. Hathaway's fifteen minutes on screen- despite my expecting otherwise, are in fact enough to earn an Oscar. Even the children playing Cosette and Gavroche are pulling their weight. You have to watch this movie like you would watch a Broadway show: for the voices and the raw performances, the decors and the epicness. If you don't like musicals all that much and are waiting for the story to get on with it, you will hate it."

","Having watched the Broadway version of Les Miserables, I had high hopes that this would be at least an adaptation of the Victor Hugo classic transposed from stage to film, done for the benefit of the hoi polloi who, for various reasons, are unable to witness the stage musical in all its glory. What we get instead is a truncated plot with more holes in it than Swiss cheese and a mishmash of actors and actresses, all professionals and veterans, singing in disharmony and disunity. Oh, well, perhaps I may have overstated. Hugh Jackman does have a pleasant singing voice, and his performance is at best, passable, as there are moments when one can feel the embodiment of Valjean in him, but at other times he is just, well, Jackman. Russell Crowe, while turning out an physically apt menacing presence as Javert, struggles to maintain the high C's (or should that be D's?), and it shows in his facial expressions. Anne Hathaway has a brief but memorable performance as Fantine, her rendition of ""I Dreamed A Dream"", while not particularly outstanding imho, does tend to rend at one's heart-strings, especially coupled with her gaunt and pathetic countenance of the factory worker turned prostitute. <br/><br/>Most disappointing of all, are the portrayals and performances of the characters the Thenardiers, who are supposed to provide the comic relief to an otherwise dark period of French revolutionary history. They are simply not in any way detestable nor funny, and I question their physical appearances particularly Mme Thenardier (in the novel and stage) is supposed to be a large, dumpy, homely harridan, here in the movie version, she's a buxom (if still dumpy) hussy shamelessly flaunting her wares at the inn's male customers. Mr Thenardier is simply too well-groomed and natty to the point of almost effeminate, and his half-hearted monotonal singing doesn't help either. ""Master of the House"" performance, supposedly the highlight of this particular scene, seems a bit rushed and makes little or no impact at all to the point of being forgettable, and neither Sascha Baron-Cohen nor Helena Bonham- Carter seem neither comfortable singing nor enjoying their roles.<br/><br/>There are a lot more I could say about this film rendition of a Broadway classic - but that has already been mentioned in other (negative) reviews in IMDb, so I'll not waste words nor space reiterating. the critic review at everythingmusicals.com pretty much sums up my feelings about this film - DON'T BOTHER watching at cinema."
"anoceanroars","5","1","5","26 February 2013"," Les Miserables made me miserable
","i will start by saying that i hate musicals, but Anne Hathaway's performance of Fantine was reason enough to sit through this miserable musical. i had written her off as an actress, but she proved me wrong. She was present for her performance and drew me into her character. The director decided to film the actor's singing live, which proved to be a big mistake, especially since he cast some actors that cannot sing. The film suffers from actors like Russell Crowe, which cannot sing at all to actors which are known for singing, Hugh, but fall flat. Eddie Redmayne should be singled out as another actor that stole the film during his scenes as Marius. i had no idea that he could sing. i am surprised that he was not nominated for his performance. Hopefully, we will see more of this fine actor. The next remake should be in French and not be a musical. Please France make it right."

","I was in love with Anne Hathaway from both the first time I had seen her face and heard her voice. Since a time I had spent as a young child. Though at said time, I was me and Anne was a fleeting romance of imaginary whimsy, a summer-camp girlfriend of preteen puppy love whose real name shall be forever kept dear; her face and character were still the image that had yet to be Miss Hathaway.<br/><br/>Lo and behold, seeing her early exploits selling houses to realizing enchantments had been nothing less than divine. A voice, charm, eyes like pools of I-would-be -lost-in -there.<br/><br/>And then it all went sour, lately. Seems the feminist crowd and the gay right have co-opted, as usual and in combat, to force the sickening and world destroying agenda of gender politics disguised as art. Sweet Anne is now to portray Winona Ryder from a ""Girl Interrupted"" ha-ha, as Anne Hathaway being Fantine. It does get confusing, I know. Anne Hathaway is a woman deserving of better than a butch job and third rate publicists. And yet, she can carry all and sundry to a higher level of talent that directors need only imagine. Cinematographers have yet to catch up on the true wiles of this amazing star. <br/><br/>Ohhh, the movie? Whatever, it was OK. High production, medium heart. Strip away the gloss, it's just sham and mentalist drudgery borne of smoke and mirrors that insult a truly great cast and production crew. Enough. Hello Dolly"
"gavin6942","7","1","5","11 February 2013"," A Visual Spectacle, Though Not My Cup of Tea
","In 19th-century France, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) after he breaks parole, agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter, Cosette. The fateful decision changes their lives forever.<br/><br/>Let me say that this film is visually stunning and for those who love the musical, I think they will be quite happy with the performances here. Tom Hooper has given our senses something to enjoy, and this may be his bet work yet (though I still prefer ""King's Speech"").<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is a performer even more so than he is an actor. Maybe that is a fine distinction, but Jackman has singing and dancing in his blood. Sure, he made a name for himself as Wolverine (among other roles), but he also starred in ""Oklahoma"" and other musicals. The world of ""Les Mis"" is no foreign territory, and he shows this. I wish I could say the same for Russell Crowe, who was pale in comparison (though with Valjean as the hero, maybe this is okay).<br/><br/>Stealing the show are Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. Could two people have filled their roles better? I doubt it. They had too brief a time on screen to be seriously considered as supporting actors, I suppose, but I would still wish that honor upon them just the same.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Anne Hathaway. I just do not care for her. I cannot say she is a bad actress and I cannot say she is a bad singer, but I did not care for her as Fantine and although she gave it 110%, I just do not have my heart in giving her an Oscar for this role. She has a Golden Globe and she is probably the Oscar front-runner, but I just do not see it. Although, I suppose this is the peak of her career (thus far).<br/><br/>More than my personal dislike of Hathaway is my apathy towards the film in general. I never fully empathized with Valjean or any of the other characters. I like the historical context of France between the two revolutions (1789 and 1848) and I appreciate that the June Rebellion is included in the musical. But the overall story is Valjean's redemption, and the story is too broad and covers too much time.<br/><br/>I know I am probably in the minority and those who love musicals are huge fans of ""Les Mis"". I like my share of musicals, but I just cannot get behind this one. I can accept it getting Oscars for sound mixing and visuals, but Anne Hathaway as best actress? No way. And best picture? It should never have been nominated."
"jtindahouse","5","1","5","2 February 2013"," Long and flawed
","When a film chooses to run for more than two and a half hours it has an expectation to justify this. Les Misérables does not. Most films with a run time this long do it because it adds to the film. They need that time to get the information out and include their action scenes. The Dark Knight is a prime example of this. Even in that case Christopher Nolan knew he would be pushing the audience's patience and so filmed the movie with very quick edits and cutaways to make the two and a half hours feel like much less. Les Misérables' long runtime on the other hand works against it. What could have been a solid story, with above average acting and some great musical numbers, instead turns into a snoozefest with the audience pleading for it to end. It's also a rare case where the first half of the film is far more entertaining than the second half. The movie's pace just grinds to a halt and never starts up again.<br/><br/>Length aside, Les Misérables is held together by some good performances throughout the cast, none more so than Anne Hathaway who had a golden 2012 in support roles (Catwoman in 'The Dark Knight Rises' being the other). Her reasonably brief appearance is certainly the highlight of the film and by far the most watchable part. Her rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' was the highlight of all the musical numbers. Hugh Jackman (the other Oscar nominated member of the cast) was not as impressive for me. He just never ""wowed"" me and his singing, whilst not awful, was nothing to write home about. Russell Crowe was so-so, I didn't love his singing but the intensity he brought to the role was well received. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen excellently provided some humour in a film that often takes itself far too seriously. <br/><br/>Unfortunately this is a real miss for me. Almost every line in the film is sung (as most will already know going in) making it almost operatic in style, which is not for everyone, including me, but I promised myself going in I would look past this and judge the film solely on its merits. It still failed for me. I never cared about a single character and felt no sympathy or joy towards any one of them at any stage. The singing was adequate for the most part and nothing more. I personally could've happily gone through my life without ever hearing Crowe sing. As previously mentioned I found it too long and think a shorter run time would've found it with a lot more fans. Overall a pretty uninspired effort, only carried by a few good performances."
"az95","5","1","5","19 January 2013"," I Dreamed a Nightmare...
","I feel a pressing need to rant about Les Miserables because OH MY GOD IT Stunk. No, seriously. It stunk. It stunked bad. Or, as they might say in the movie, iiiiiit waaaaaaas baaaaad.<br/><br/>First, let me say that I am a theater geek. I've seen Phantom of the Opera on Broadway, I once snuck into Avenue Q, and a good chunk of my iPod is composed of songs from musicals. I had never seen Les Mis, never read the original Hugo novel, didn't know anything about it except that it is set during once of the most interesting periods of history- at least in my opinion- the French Revolution. I went into the theater with an open mind and expected to come out with a new crop of songs to sing in the shower.<br/><br/>I guess I'll have to stick to my old tunes.<br/><br/>I think the movie is bad because the source material wasn't that great to begin with. A policeman, Javert, chases after Jean Valjean, a thief-turned-hero (He stole a loaf of bread! Oh, the horror!) for, what, 19 years? And all because the guy broke his parole. And when Javert realizes he will never catch Jean, who, for whatever reason- I guess because he's nice and believes in hope and love and rainbows- spared his life, Javert kills himself. And thank God for that, because Russell Crowe cannot sing.<br/><br/>And that's what really gets me about this movie. They could have AT LEAST CAST SOMEONE WHO COULD SING INSTEAD OF CASTING SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE HE'S FAMOUS. I mean, really. I'm no brilliant actress myself, but I can't imagine it requires any Brando-esque acting chops to pull off Javert, you know? There are probably a million starving actors out there who could have pulled off the part and perhaps earned an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>And speaking of Oscar nods, I read an article in Entertainment Weekly about Anne Hathaway and it made me very sad. I'll tell you why: She literally had to starve herself for the role of Fantine, and she said she couldn't sleep at night because she was so hungry. Even worse, she said filming wasn't a fun experience at all. It took 9 hours to film ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" and when she got home she ""crawled into her husband's arms"" because she was so emotionally-drained. And all for a 20 minute role in absolutely awful script. I hate thinking about how much emotion she put into a script that has no inherent emotion itself. I really didn't feel too bad when Fantine died because I hardly had time to get to know her. I was only sorry that Anne didn't have any more screen time. Or a better script.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the whole police chasing a criminal who redeemed himself by helping out a prostitute plot seemed to me like a watered-down, French adaptation of Crime and Punishment. And even though I hated that book, I can at least appreciate it for its depth and (dull) brilliance.<br/><br/>As for Les Mis, I can't believe I wasted ten dollars on that movie when a certain Daniel Day-Lewis(!!!) was being all cute and super Method-y right in the next theater."
"contrascout","4","1","5","20 January 2013"," Not what I hoped for
","I don't write reviews often, but I have to add my 2 cents in this production. I've seen Les Mis live multiple times in multiple countries with a variety of casts and sets. I'm pretty sure anyone that gives this film anything over 6 stars has never heard anyone sing and project to an audience. The acting is good, but if you are going to cast a musical, find people that can use there voice, not just sing in a studio. I'm actually surprised that an actor/actress that can learn to sing well enough to pull of this production fails to learn to USE that voice. The entire thing is as flat as a MIDI file in the early 90s. I was never drawn into this film far enough to forget who the actor was and let the characters take hold, the performance was just that bad. That, and I feel like this movie is a parody movie where they're making fun of producing scenes to win an award.<br/><br/>If you see this movie, like/love it......buy a ticket for the musical and go, you'll be glad you did. Yes, it'll be live and nothing is ever perfect, but the stage production is miles above this failure.<br/><br/>All in all, I really wanted to love this movie. The production of Phantom came across so well and this was the opposite. It's unfortunate because the story and music for Les Mis is much better and this movie fails to connect in that manner."
"dukegleeson","4","1","5","19 January 2013"," Les Miserables was really awful
","As a big fan of the musical since I was the age of 10 (15 years) I was very much looking forward to the creation of a film. First i'd like to congratulate Tom Hooper for bring real singing back real singing back to movies. Yes indeed studio recording are gone.<br/><br/>The movie start off with a rather epic beginning which i thought was rather exciting and the visual was powerful. I slowly counted down to the moment when Javert (Russel Crowe)would enter the musical. As I was always worried about his singing abilities (his album) perhaps best poked fun at by South Park. He was much better than I expected him to be so I feel that I have to give him some credit for that. However I overall felt that his performance lacked power, conviction, self assurance. As this is such a key role in the film i felt that a lot was taken away.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was OK i felt that 'Bring him home' was especially week. Although yes you can not compare him to Tom Wilkonsson (the original Valjean) by any measure of the imagination. His performances were quite lack luster and most songs lacked rise and fall. For me he does NOT deserve to win a Oscar compared to the other performances in the category.<br/><br/>perhaps the biggest mistake of the film was the casting of the Thénardier's which are suppose to be the comedy character of Les Mis. There scenes were carefully constructed however EXTREMELY poorly executed. I've never laughed less compared to the other times i've seen the musical on DVD or on stage. Their songs were sung really poorly and I felt the didn't suit the roles. The actors came across as they were not confortable with the roles. Considering there weakness they were given far too much screen time.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway was great thought through and executed. Samantha Barks was very good which i expected since she has filled the role of epoinne quite a few times on the stage.<br/><br/>The Barackage was pathetic and looked like a gust of wind might blow the whole thing away. Even the construction scene was poor.<br/><br/>One thing that struck me about the songs throughout the songs were that they seemed really flat and soulless. I don't know if that was Tom Hoopers choice since even Wilkonson was flat. it made all the songs quite boring. The transition some were good others were really really poor. It seemed like that they took the 25th Anniversary version (with the changed lyrics and extra song or two) and made it so much worse that. Such a terrible disappointment seeing this film. IF YOU WANT to see Les Mis go and see it at the Theatre."
"lisamaria142","5","1","5","19 January 2013"," Carrying a tune in bucket with holes
","First off, I will clarify my decision by saying that I have read the book ""Les Miserables"" by Victor Hugo, and seen many movies, plays and adaptations (both in English and in French), so it's fair to say that I have seen this piece many a times. I'll start off by pointing out the positives.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway as Fantine was by far the strongest of the cast. Her voice was both melodic and heart breaking. She deserves all her recognition and praise for this role. Fantine has always represented the downtrodden that unfortunately can't get back up. Anne Hathaway understands this and plays her role wonderfully. Next, I really enjoyed how they portrayed the Revolution and introduced characters that sometimes get ignored in other productions: namely Eponine and Enjolras (as well as the rest of the ABC friends). It's great to see this film actually portray what was a big part of Victor Hugo's story and how it wasn't just a background set piece: it added a lot to the film to see the preparation and the actual Revolution. The costumes and makeup were very well done as well (although I am not an expert, but they certainly held my attention). I also enjoyed the smooth camera work. Tom Hooper has an excellent reputation with artistic filming. The comic relief was also very well done (praise to the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I must stop my praise there. The first and biggest problem I had with the movie was the singing. This is coming from someone who loves the opera and Broadway musicals of all kinds. I am certainly not against movie-musicals either (Sound Of Music, Fiddler on the Roof, etc.) but unfortunately, this movie missed a big mark: singing. I feel like many people have forgotten that all these actors are just that: actors. And while they may have had voice lessons and professional coaches, none of them are professional singers. This doesn't mean that they did a bad job (As I mentioned, Fantine was very well done, as well as some of the others), but it takes away a lot from the movie. Let's be honest: Russel Crowe is NOT a singer. He is a wonderful actor, but he is not a singer. As well as Hugh Jackman, for his acting and emotions were very well done, his singing was sub par. This is a big miss considering he and Russel Crowe are the main characters. I wish instead of using big name celebrities, they would have found people who could simultaneously sing and act, or if the movie hadn't focused on the singing (which probably deters from the point of the movie). Unfortunately, this movie falls short mainly because of that. If you listen to the London Broadway version, you will hear exactly how much better the emotions and the story becomes when it's sung professionally. <br/><br/>I have a few other knit picks: such as why did some of the actors have cockney British accents when it's a French story in France? I was also a little disappointed by the romance between Cosette and Marius. In the book, they do fall in love at first glance, but here, even that feels a bit...rushed. Which is a paradox to my next criticism, the timing. I feel the pacing of the movie could have been better. Some parts were riveting and exciting, but some just seemed to drag on (which I suppose were used to create contrast, but just annoyed me). I understand that the book is over a thousand pages long and it's very hard to decide which parts are ""important"" or not, but I feel it could have been done better. <br/><br/>My final verdict is that it was an OK movie. Nothing really stood out to me. It's all been done before (but in this day and age, what hasn't?) and I wish they would have invested more time on the singing (considering it's a core part of the film)."
"DefLowd","5","1","5","19 January 2013"," They should have either recast the actors or redub their voices.
","This is an opera where the singing is just inexcusably poor. The filmmakers captured all the singing live on set, which is a great idea in concept, terrible in execution. It might have worked if they got better singers, but that was not the case. Only the classically trained singers (Samantha Barks, the chorus) shine. Everyone else just can't pull it off. Big songs that should hit hard just fall flat...one after the other. The film consequently just drags, as the script goes from song to song in the show. Like most adaptations in 2012, it suffers from being too faithful to the source material. <br/><br/>I feel bad for the Hollywood cast, they seem to try their best but only Anne Hathaway sounds competent. It's just a fundamental flaw with the film. How can you make an opera with people who can't sing?"
"aadc1","Null","1","5","18 January 2013"," The worst thing is the singing all along the whole movie!
","I saw once an older version (1958) of this one with Jean Gabin on TV and was astonished that I could like such kind of movies. Dramas I mean as usually I do not like them. But the classic one had a wonderful coherent story line. Good actors and all fitted together. Here it is a different thing. The worst thing is the singing all along the whole movie! I mean common' people what's that?! And then such horrible singing, especially from Russel Crowe. I was very surprised to see him, specially him, when you have seen him in Romper Stomper and Gladiator and then this?! Strange, really strange experience. If there wasn't the singing I think I would have liked it more. Also I was surprised to see Sacha Baron Cohen in this one. If you consider that normally he plays in a complete other kind of movies (Borat, Brüno) which I like much more. But he played well and funny."
"TheSquiss","5","1","5","14 January 2013"," Perfect for aficiandi, endurance for all else. And apparently the French Revolution was fought by Cockneys!
","I'm not a big fan of musicals. I love the great rousing songs that lift the heart and prickle the hairs on the back of the neck, but I just can't get to grip with all those people singing dialogue instead of just talking. As I child I enjoyed the classics (Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Sound of Music et al) on TV and ventured forth to the West End to relish Time and cringe at both Cats and, yes, Les Misérables. So what the heck, I hear you ask, was I playing at by going to see Les Misérables at the cinema? <br/><br/>Um, (in a tiny voice) I was impressed by the trailer <br/><br/>And there's my lesson for the day: Great trailers are not indications of great films! The trailer for Les Misérables is excellent. It provides us with a glimpse of the stunning sets, an introduction to the principal stars, sorry, characters, and excites with snippets of those famous rousing songs (you know the ones I mean) that do the prickly hair thing. The trouble is, they account for only about twenty minutes of the 157-minute running time, which is still five minutes shorter than the stage production.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, in fact it's more than adequate and has moments of being excellent but, my goodness, it goes on and on and on The opening sequence is a terribly clumsy mix of set and CGI in which an almost unrecognizable Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean pulls on a rope with a hundred other prisoners while glaring up at the disdainful Javert (Russell Crowe) and we understand the relationship between the two and get to grips with the history of the former. It's when we also discover that Crowe isn't a terribly good singer and get accustomed to hearing him strain himself as he attempts to warble masterfully. Perhaps he should return to gladiatorial school.<br/><br/>Jackman owns the screen when he is emblazoned across it. His performance as the unfairly convicted man who finds good in the world when a priest refuses to shop him for theft is masterful. He sings powerfully and will surely take a Golden Globe tomorrow night for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. While his screen time with the standout Anne Hathaway as Fantine (I predict a Golden Globe and an Oscar) is brief, their scenes are amongst the most watchable. Hathaway's presence is sorely missed when she exits the film and her performance is saturated with heartfelt emotion. Director Tom Hooper shoots her I Dreamed a Dream sequence largely with a single shot and the wretchedness of the mother forced in to prostitution to support her daughter is palpable and deeply affecting. What a pity such emotion and high quality doesn't continue throughout the film.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne, as Marius, continues his ascent of Hollywood but while he sings surprisingly well and he seems comfortable in the role, his impact is reduced by the ridiculousness of the plot. While most readers will know the story, for those odd one or who who don't, I shall refrain from pointing out quite how ridiculous the events are for fear of spoiling the film. If you don't know the story, just don't approach Les Misérables hoping for logic. The film is faithful to the play but that doesn't make the idiocy of certain characters' decisions any easier to deal with.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried (as Cosette) carries much of the film but she is overshadowed by her rival for Marius' love by the Samantha Barks' Éponine. Barks has a screen presence Seyfried can only dream of and there is a sense of belief in her performance as opposed to Seyfried who lacks depth or passion.<br/><br/>In all such films, there has to be a comedic turn or, if you're really 'lucky', a double act. With sour memories of The Dictator, I dreaded the appearance of Sacha Baron Cohen as Thénardier, the innkeeper, but he and Helena Bonham Carter waltz brashly through Les Misérables bring life and colour when it is most needed.<br/><br/>Yes, Les Misérables looks good, the songs will engage, it will satisfy the die-hard musical aficiandi and it is clearly the best musical on the big screen at the moment (yes, I know it's the only one!) but why, when it is based in France is it performed largely by Kiwis, Aussies, Brits and Americans in every accent other than Gallic, the notable exception being Cohen? Since when did peasants in the French Revolution have Cockney accents? If you love musicals, and watch the stage version a million times, you'll love Les Misérables, but it isn't going to convert anybody to the musical cause and is an endurance rather than a great night out.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"
"jillk60517","7","1","5","13 January 2013"," ...Comparing to the Stage Productions
","The movie will be probably most appreciated by those who haven't fallen in love with this work on stage. The movie went for star power over voice power in almost every character, doing disservice to the most beloved numbers. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman - Jean Valjean. A fabulous performance by Jackman. He's unrecognizable in the opening Valjean imprisoned character. Incredible transformation. Slightly higher pitched than the stage version Valjeans I've seen, but it works. I was moved to tears during his Bring Me Home...and judging by all the sniffling around me, mission accomplished. He deserves his nomination. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe - Javert. Of the six times I've seen Les Mis, five on stage, Crowe's Javert performance ranks 6th. He is a good singer, not great. Javert's performers on stage have commanded standing Os every time. If Crowe were on stage, other than for the Javert role prominence, I doubt anyone would be standing because of his voice.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway - Fantine. An A for effort but a D- for voice appeal. I'm speechless at how poor a singer Anne Hathaway is and the superlative accolades she's receiving. She murdered I Dreamed a Dream - nails on the chalkboard. At one point I covered my mouth - in shock. Fantine's voice is supposed to be beautiful and convey deep anguish. She conveyed the anguish fine but it made my ears hurt. There was nothing beautiful about it. She simply does not have a good singing voice. It was literally hard to listen to and it seemed endless. She gives her whole heart to her performance, but she shouldn't be in a musical starring role. <br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried - Cosette. The star voice of the show. Best Cosette I've seen. She masters everything and her range is stunning. <br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne - Marius. Reminded me of a high school musical performance. Every time he sang Eponine's name it sounded different. Fair voice, not great. Countless performers could do better. Disappointed with the casting of this very important supporting character. Distracting physicality including extreme vibration of throat, mouth. Incredulous love at first sight. Now the Enjolras actor would be a different story. Not Redmayne's fault, they miscast him.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks - Eponine. Excellent Eponine. As good as any I've seen. Great voice, beautiful girl whose story evokes emotion in the audience.<br/><br/>Aaron Tveit - Enjolras. Excellent performance. Wish he had been cast as Marius though. I'd understand why Cosette would get worked up over Aaron. <br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter - Thenardier couple. Drop them on the stage anytime, anywhere. They were perfect.<br/><br/>Colm Wilkinson - Bishop. Best performance for this role ever. He and the movie version of this character explain the effect on Valjean better than the stage ever has. His role is so powerful you are reminded of him throughout the movie unlike the stage version ever achieved but would have benefited from. <br/><br/>The movie feels like an old friend - reminding you of the best of times. However, when you look at the friend today, you see a not-so-strong version of the friend of yesteryear. <br/><br/>For those who have trouble with musicals, since there is very little talking in this movie, it is similar to watching a movie with subtitles...you get used to every word being sung and the music becomes a subconscious thread adding depth to the words.<br/><br/>The casting agent went for stars who could sing. Most of them could anyway. I'd prefer no-names who are better singers (but keep Jackman and Seyfried). In the scenes where the non-stars performed (crowds, etc), those performers were as good as stage. Since the characters nominated have been played thousands of times by better voices across the globe over the past couple decades, it would be difficult to understand how they would win an Academy Award. I'm very pleased Jackman's performance was recognized as he was excellent."

","No one can put the blame on Hollywood for this musical adaptation of the great Victor Hugo novel of the same title, for it was conceived by two Frenchmen, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil. The work, which started in Paris, made it to the London's West End by a genius of hype, one Cameron Mackinstosh, who gave it a fabulous theatrical production, which finally made it to Broadway, where it ran for some seventeen years.<br/><br/>The work was ripe for a screen adaptation, so enter Tom Hopper, who had a hit with ""The King's Speech"" a couple of years before, as well as the television series ""John Adams"". On paper, Mr. Hopper seemed the right man to be at the helm of the screen adaptation. The film, unfortunately, has not the same feeling as what was transmitted in the theater. Part of the problem appears to be in Mr. Hopper's insistence in having the actors sing directly as they were portraying their parts, rather than have the music synchronized to the actors who had lip-synched the actual songs.<br/><br/>It becomes clear the two principals, Hugh Jackman, and Russell Crowe were not up to the task demanded from them. Hugh Jackman, a charismatic actor who has done well on Broadway, sounded as though he was having trouble with the almost operatic voice, demanded for his role. His voice almost cracks at times. Russell Crowe, on the other hand, is clearly out of his element. The best thing in this version is Anne Hathaway, who makes the most of the material and shows she can sing. Amanda Seyfried makes a nice Cosette. The best things in this dramatic show are Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter."
"headly66","7","1","5","1 January 2013"," Beautiful. moving but way way too long.
","The GOOD: The costumes, scenery, singing and acting were incredible. Ann Hathaway is very moving especially in her solo in the beginning. Hugh Jackman runs the range of emotions and does a great job carrying the story.<br/><br/>The BAD: As with the stage play, it runs way too long (about 20 mins), each time you think it's over someone starts to sing again to the point where you are cringing. The only flaw as the singers were concerned is obviously with Russell Crowe who puts in a good performance, although not as good as any Inspector Javert done before, but he is given too great a task to sing these heavy tunes. He is OK, and that's does not cut it, put it this way, he would never have made the cast of the play.<br/><br/>All in all one of the better musicals ever, though it needs some more speaking here and there to give it balance.<br/><br/>PS: Sit in a comfortable chair."

","The story was kept intact from the play. The acting was great. All the actors really brought the full range of emotions of the characters to life. The singing was indescribably amazing. Russel Crowe did not sing as strong as the rest of the cast. Javert was not as loose with his emotions as other characters. His restraint of singing came through as a control of his emotions, not lack of emotions. Anne, Amanda, and Samantha were so great, they could have played any of the parts. <br/><br/>The constant facial close-ups during the songs took away from the grandeur of the movie. Many times during the close-ups, the focus was not kept. This lack of focus had no relationship to the song. The sets appeared marvelous but during the songs, 90% of what you saw was the face of the singer and little else. <br/><br/>Without the great acting and singing I would rate it a 1 out of 10."

","This movie had some amazing stand out performances. However the technique used to capture the actors' singing while was effective at some points was also very problematic. Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried were the standouts and gave incredible performances. Eddie Redmayne and Russell Crowe really left a lot to be desired. The way the camera drunkenly swung around was dizzying and frustrating at times. I am someone who has read the book twice and worships the stage production so it was a little disappointing seeing this film fall a little flat.

"jessie-rex","10","1","5","29 December 2012"," Les Miserable - Possible Spoilers
","Though I love musicals, this was my first encounter with Les Miz. I had done a little homework and had the general gist of the storyline, but a dry synopsis doesn't do this story justice. I won't go into the story, you either know it, or can read up on it yourself.<br/><br/>So, my review, this movie is gritty, and awe-inspiring. I love the live singing! I guess I am not a very vicious critic, everyone did an admirable job in their roles. I have read criticism of Amanda Seyfried's voice and depth of character. I love Amanda's voice, quite warbly here, but as the sheltered, even ""caged"" Cosette, I thought the vocal talent was perfect. As for the lack of acting depth, I didn't time her minutes on screen, but she is really asked to put across a lot in a little time. That she and Marius fall in love at first sight is stretching credibility, but it is written that way, and with her beauty, I can imagine a young man in a bitter struggle for liberty could find her the image of the perfect world for which he is fighting.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman carried the movie nobly, and Anne Hathaway was wonderful; I wish she had been allowed more screen time to flesh out her role, maybe more back story. SB Cohen and HB Carter were both perfectly cast as the Thenardiers.<br/><br/>All in all everyone gave stirring performances; I think the difference in voice and performance quality gives a realism to the show."
"rjdoan","10","1","5","29 December 2012"," A Must See Movie to End the year
","Despite some of the early reviews which indicated that the movie was less than spectacular, I went to see it for myself. I admit, I have never seen the staged production and I read the book by Victor Hugo so long ago that I have forgotten the intimate details of the story.<br/><br/>I loved the movie. I loved the music. I enjoyed the cinematography and the acting and the character development.<br/><br/>The movie is real and gritty. The characters are caked with the reality of life during the early 19th century. I could almost smell the streets of France as the movie progressed.<br/><br/>The movie spans 1815-1832 during periods of rebellion and revolution in France; beginning with the final defeat of Napoleon and ending with the June Rebellion. The story revolves around a man, Jean Valjean, played by Hugh Jackman. He was imprisoned for minor thievery for 19 years and is pursued through the rest of his life for breaking parole by the chief policeman, Javert, played by Russell Crowe. Along the way, Jean adopts the daughter of Fantine, played by Anne Hathaway, who had fallen on very hard times and was striving to provide for her daughter, Cosette, played by Amanda Seyfried.<br/><br/>The music is spectacular and real. The character development is well done and effective. Did I say the music is fabulous?<br/><br/>Isabelle Allen is stunning and effective as the young Cosette. It is her face that forms the poster for the movie.<br/><br/>Th movie is long, listed at 165 minutes, but it is a fast movie. There are few places where it drags and the depth of the acting , the story, and the richness of the sets and characters make it a very engrossing movie.<br/><br/>I found the make-up to age the characters through the years to be especially intriguing. I also know that many of the actors starved themselves to give the realistic appearance of being destitute during the period of the movie.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, this movie ought to have a lot of Oscar nominations: Best picture, Best actor: Hugh Jackman, Best supporting actress: Anne Hathaway, make-up, costumes, set design, and a few others.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATION: See this movie! Bring tissues for the ending."
"quizzard123","8","1","5","27 December 2012"," Good, but not great
","After having seen Les Mis 5 times, in three cities on two continents, I was hoping but worried about a film adaptation. I have to say that I wasn't horrified, but also don't consider it a great movie. It was a decent adaptation of a great musical.<br/><br/>Pros: Hugh Jackman's Veljean was credible. Not the best I've heard, but very good. Bring him home still resonates in my chest.<br/><br/>Loved seeing Colm Wilkinson, the original Valjean, both early in the film and waiting for Valjean at the end. Nice touch.<br/><br/>Probably the best Marius I have seen. Marius always comes across as a whiny wimp on stage, it was nice to make him a little more real.<br/><br/>By adding in a few scenes, the movie would probably have been easier to follow for non aficionados than the theatre piece is.<br/><br/>When it came to the big numbers, the movie ALMOST always came through. The final scene had half the people in the theatre singing along, and I've never seen so many people having to sit and get their composure before leaving a movie. Absolutely thrilling in that respect.<br/><br/>Cons: I seem to be alone in NOT liking Anne Hathaway's performance. It just seemed too over the top, and it was NOT helped by the insistence on filming every song in tight close up. I get it, she'd had a bad life, and I get it, we gave them all makeup to look really poor and sick, but i really don't need to see every detail of their rotten teeth or messed up complexion. I found the constant tight close ups very annoying by the end.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe? Meh. Could have been worse I suppose, but I found he was singing to the camera, not to the upper balcony, and with The Stars above or his final scene, it NEEDS to be sung to the back of the room, and both fell flat for me. Decent voice, but just not enough power when it was needed.<br/><br/>Did not like Sasha Cohen at all, and had to admit that I was disappointed in Helena Bonham Carter. She added nothing of her own personality or power to the role. It was a competent performance, but not much more. Perhaps that explains the Thenardier's roles being reduced.<br/><br/>I found the orchestration weak. When the music should have been rising along with the song, they didn't always bring it up enough. It seemed to get better as the movie went along, though, and for the mass anthems such as Do you hear the People, both singing and music were perfect.<br/><br/>The last point I'll make is a big one for me, and that is the editing. I know this is a movie, not a stage production, but after a big number, there has to be a pause. Just a few seconds to let the crowd breathe a little. To jarringly jump to the next scene right after On my own, or Bring him Home, or 24601 just sucks all the drama out of it. <br/><br/>All in all, a decent adaptation. Might even go see it again. But did they knock it out of the ballpark? No, not quite."
"afigueroa-522-249844","10","1","5","27 December 2012"," Perfecto....What a Great Movie
","I saw this movie on Christmas later in the day, and heard mixed reviews about it. So I decided to check it out myself. After watching it, I know I will go back and watch it again. I believe all the actor did a fantastic job. If you watch the play or read the book, I highly recommend this for you to watch. If was so heartwarming and you will like it. I believe Crowe was a great Javert but to hear him sing was kind of different. don't get me wrong, was a good choice, but watching him in gladiator and this Les Miserable, was different. I say WATCH IT. GREAT MOVIE!!!! We all clapped in the theatre and all cried at some part. You just want to sing along if you know the songs. Every moment was perfect."
"shutesrl-161-284149","7","1","5","27 December 2012"," Not Bad/Not Good Either
","Les Miserables was written as music, not a classic stage play with dialogue. Therefore, first and foremost, you need people who have the vocal talent, musical background, and range to perform this. The director relied to heavily on 'acting.' It is the music that carries Les Miserables, not acting. Using Hollywood big names in any role may stimulate box office receipts but in the end dooms the production. Russell Crowe - a great Roman general, lousy singer. Hugh Jackman - should have stayed with X-Men. Eddie Redmayne - best of the group, but needs coaching to do Marius. Aaron Tveit - good but not the caliber I've seen on the stage. Similar comments for the other actors as well. This is a good attempt but falls short. The music as always, moves your soul, just overlook who's performing. I'm surprised Cameron MacIntosh signed off on the choice of actors."
"paulclaassen","5","1","6","2 July 2018"," Incredible production, but no.
","Let's face it, I'm a big Hugh Jackman fan, and due to the media and critics referring to the film as ""sensational"", I eagerly anticipated watching the film. Boy, was I disappointed. The film is no doubt visually stunning, and from that perspective a masterpiece, actually. The plot, however, left very little to be desired. No one in this film seem to recognize anyone, and everyone seem to die for no apparent reason, and they have a little boy lead a revolution!! The young lovers in the form of Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried becomes inseparable after having just met. Nothing about this film is convincing, not even the singing (which, quite frankly, became way too much for me to swallow). Russell Crowe is completely miscast and his character also dies in the most pathetic way. I mean, seriously?!"
"muellercraft","1","1","6","22 January 2015"," Much worse than the stage version
","I saw Les Miserables on Broadway some years ago and had very mixed feelings about it. The production had some emotional power: the funny scenes were funny, the sad scenes were sad, the stirring scenes were generally stirring. That said, I decided I didn't like the musical because I simply don't like the plot. I haven't read the original story, I hasten to add -- maybe it was better as literature. But the plot of the musical is hard to buy into. The main characters make a habit of doing things that make no sense. They are self-destructive in a way that seems to be almost like an ancient Greek drama: the Fates have decreed that so-and-so must suffer, and so suffer he shall. On and on, for his whole life. And his children's children unto the seventh generation.<br/><br/>The plot aspects dealing with the short-lived 1833 revolution really don't work for me. This was one of many French mini-revolutions that seems (at least to a non-Frenchman) to have been about nothing in particular and accomplishes nothing in particular.<br/><br/>Now on to the movie version. I give some points to the producers for attempting to get a live feel to the performances. It is a conversion of a stage play, after all. Still, I don't think the effort really works. The camera angles are all wrong, and made me feel cramped and dirty. I don't really want to enter that world viscerally, I guess.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the fact that the performers were basically film actors rather than stage performers. I don't think that's necessarily a disqualifier, but it does create problems. Singing on pitch is only part of the challenge, after all. The singer's art also encompasses feeling and nuance. The skills required to do that on film don't always correspond to what it takes on stage. In any event, the singing just didn't work for me in this version. When you decide to film a production in which every word is sung, that's a problem.<br/><br/>The combination of not really liking the story combined with the flaws in presentation chased me from my seat about an hour in. Came back to pick up the rest of the family when it was over and they generally wished they had fled early with me.<br/><br/>If you really love the stage version and you can tolerate second or third tier vocal performances you may want to see this. Otherwise I can't think of any reason to bother."
"volkan65","4","1","6","25 February 2013"," Weak as musical, fast-forwarding in storytelling
","Having read the novel the second time recently from a more comprehensive translation, I felt that the film was fast-forwarding the events too much for the sake of making it a musical. It doesn't tell us how J. Valjean became a mayor, how Fantine had his child, why the factory workers hated her, and the most important events were squeezed into seconds. Of course it's a bulky novel, a challenge by itself for those who want to turn it into a 2-3 hour movie. I could have forgiven this if only it was a good musical.<br/><br/>Similarly, I didn't expect all of the cast to be good singers in so far as they can act. Some of them did good (such as Anne Hathaway), some was just OK (such as Hugh Jackman, S.B. Cohen), but R. Crowe's singing was awful. However the actors' talent as singers was not the worst part of it; it was the composing. Not even a single tune that stuck. In fact, apart from the last song they sung as Medley at Oscars, it doesn't seem that the composers put much effort into it. Most of the time actors seem to be improvising melodies for their lines, in the worst possible way. In an average Broadway show you can find more catchy tunes."
"thechez2004","3","1","7","5 April 2013"," Terrible film
","This was a film I was really looking forward to but after an hour I was almost suicidal,The story is impossible to follow unless you have read the book or seen an earlier film and the constant singing was so annoying. It just seemed to jump from scene to scene without any explanation and the girl and the boy fell hopelessly in love after one glance in a crowded market. The later scenes during the riots were agonisingly long and I thought they would never end. The opening scenes in the prison never explained the relationship between the hero and villain.<br/><br/>This could have been a superb film but I would not recommend it to my worst enemy."
"timsiepel","3","1","7","19 January 2013"," Good bye Javert
","The best part of this movie was when Javert jumped in the Seine, because I knew I wouldn't have to listen to Russell Crowe sing any more. Unfortunately, Hugh Jackman's character lived on, for another half hour. As someone who can't sing, I can sympathize with the plight of Mssrs Crowe and Jackman: How can one turn down all that money, despite the risk of permanently damaging one's career, and humiliating oneself in front of thousands of real singers! I suppose I too, would have humbled myself, and taken the job. Thankfully, I wasn't asked. It must be admitted that several of the supporting players, such as Amanda Seyfridd, did very well, and we thank them for that."
"ahmad_hgh","4","1","7","2 January 2013"," Good production, but musicals are so outdated!
","Good acting, good costumes, etc. my only problem with this movie was that it was a musical. I find it very hard to drown my self in a story when everyone is singing every single word in their conversation. If it was made like a normal movie it would have been a masterpiece. But musicals are a little ridiculous (IMHO). In a serious scene, having someone singing in the front and a group of people acting as a choir in the back repeating the main persons words is just too ridiculous for me, so I stepped out of the theater. So in summary, everything about this movie was good, but making it as a musical ruined it (again IMHO). I think if someone comes along and make it again as a 2 hour normal movie it will be a huge success."
"Stewball","6","1","7","26 December 2012"," Not even for musical lovers
","I'm a big musical fan, but this (the 11th film iteration of the book with ever how many of those as musicals), as I suspected is a one and a half song wonder. The lyrics are good enough, but for most of the movie, all of the dialogue is set to musical notes placed in the score with a shotgun. Add to that the the subject matter, class warfare between snobs and ""the miserables"" with their hands out and chips on their shoulders. The only one I really liked was the little token French Oliver who was sharp as hell and had spunk. Anne Hathaway and ESPECIALLY Amanda Seyfried have superb voices, but the rest were only so so, including Samantha Barks who probably gets some sympathy points for her character.<br/><br/>I think this franchise gets a lot of support from people (many of whom were applauding at the end), because it makes them feel that by doing so they're doing something for the poor. I'm just glad this wasn't a theater production where I'd have had to endure the endless encore applause with the audience and the cast all making each other feel good, thinking the story applies to modern Western Civilization in some way."

","Can you hear the people sing? If not, try listening harder to 'Les Miserables.' Tom Hooper's take on the musical based on the Victor Hugo classic is a raucous, bloated Parisian behemoth that embraces its musical roots to its detriment.<br/><br/>'Miserables' boasts an A-list cast and earned a best picture nomination in addition to others, but it's hard to see how it got there. Sure, Anne Hathaway isn't a half-bad singer (Russell Crowe, on the other hand...). And yes, there is some pretty awesome set design going on here. And sure, the numbers from the musical are magical, from ""I Dreamed a Dream"" to ""One Day More,"" but the way they are brought to life on the big screen feel lackluster at best.<br/><br/>There's also just too much going on in this adaptation. Sure, it's hard to fit the story into an appropriate runtime, and you're never going to please anyone when you take on a classic like 'Miserables.' But Hooper probably could have decided to make a few different decisions in some areas.<br/><br/>If you are a huge fan of the musical genre, you probably shouldn't skip 'Les Miserables.'

I watched Les Miserables mostly on the strength of the reviews and found it perfectly awful. The story was so so, the acting was blah, and the singing was cringworthy. Producers of musicals tend to cast singers who can also act to some degree because a ""musical"" mostly relies on the music. Here we have decent actors who can't sing and consequently seem out of their comfort zone in the acting department as well . Listening to them struggle thru their various songs was more tortuous than watching the terrible injustices their characters were living out in the story.

I actually watch movies simply because HE is in them *drool*) and Samantha Barks (She IS the best Eponine, ever).<br/><br/>And I absolutely LOVE Les Mis. So to summarize it: I was SOO looking forward to this movie. My favorite actors and actresses coming together in my favorite musical.. I really thought it couldn't be such a big disappointment as it was...<br/><br/>The Singing! No, no, no, no. Amanda Seyfried who I KNOW can sing sounds like a chirping bird, and it's unbearable. I know they decided to not record the songs in a studio and act according to them, but to sing while acting and that's a pretty nice idea. Kind of like how they do in musicals. The problem is just that these people aren't trained musical artists. They are are wonderful actors and actresses, BUT listening to them ""sing"" while acting was horrible. <br/><br/>Samantha Barks! She is the BEST Eponine according to me. She's an amazing singer and she's done a marvelous job in all the Les Mis productions EXCEPT for this. I don't know what happened, but the key in ""On my own"" was low and the movie's version of On my Own is the worst I've heard by far. I KNOW she's capable to do soooo much more and the only reason for why things went the way it did was because of the directors as far as I can figure out. <br/><br/>The Acting! The acting was good. Because that's what these actors and actresses are good at! But please, leave the singing to the trained! <br/><br/>All in all: 1. For future references: Cast musical actors and actresses to do the singing AND the acting is necessary. 2. Before making a new version of a musical, it's best to listen to the actual original songs and know how they are supposed to be performed (For example: On my Own is a cry in the void made by Eponine. She sings in hope to over voice her broken heart. This is a POWERFUL song. Something the directors, writers and musical department failed to realize . 3. I gave this film a 4 because of the acting, ALONE. Watching this movie on mute with subtitles is a very beautiful experience. And that's the only way this'll be an enjoyable movie for me. Looking at Eddie Redmayne and Hugh Jackman... *drool* <br/><br/>Watching this version of Les Mis was just as painful as to watch Nick Jonas taking on the role as Marius in the 25th Les Mis anniversary, and THAT is saying much. Re-do it, do it right."

","Watching this movie has been one of the most emotional experiences of my life. I slightly knew about it through middle school chorus and slight mentions of it in the dinner table. I knew this was going to be a good movie when I saw the trailer on TV. It was a musical and Anne Hathaway starred in it, I couldn't pass this up. After seeing the movie, I was in awe. I felt like I was in France, experiencing what the characters are going through. The movie felt so natural and it wasn't like any other musical I've seen. Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar 100% and I was mad that Hugh Jackman didn't win for best actor and the film for best picture. I thought they deserved it fair and square. And the Oscar performance from the les mis cast was beautiful. It was so nice to see everyone together! What I really loved about the film is the chemistry between everyone. Though Valjean and Javert played cat and mouse with each other, they are best friends off screen. I also heard that the girl cast members would sing karaoke when they were not filming. I felt the connection. It was real. I didn't mind that most of the dialogue is sung. I have to say that I cringed at some moments (sorry guys), but it gives it more of a natural feel. The acting is spot on. I easily felt the emotion the characters gave off, which was why I felt like I was in 1800's France. I also realized there was a Broadway musical and a couple of concerts along with a book (yes they all came before the movie, but I had no clue until after I've seen the film). I have not read the book yet (it's over 1000 pages!), but I have seen it on Broadway and seen the concert (even the one with Nick Jonas, which I LOVED --> I was a Jonas Brothers fan back in the day). I loved them all. It's a beautiful, yet sad story and YOU should find a way to watch this through the film or Broadway musical. It's 24601% worth it!"

","This is by far my favorite film due to its excellent music, acting, and story line. The first aspect that especially caught my attention was the fact that the actors sang the entire film live. Not only did they do a fantastic job vocally, but this aspect made this film unique from the rest. Secondly, the directors did an excellent job in casting for the film. Each actor/actress was a perfect fit for each roll and they did a great job portraying the character through their personality, costumes, and mannerisms. Lastly, the directors did a great job in turning a well-known play into an enjoyable film. Although it is common for people to be disappointed after watching a film that is based off of a play, this film exceeds many expectations. I would personally recommend this film to anyone who has read the novel, seen the live performance, or just loves musicals in general!"

","I've never been interested in this musical because the idea of turning a novel like Les Misérables into a musical seemed insane, like making a musical based on the Holocaust. But I happened on the fantastic video of Anne Hathaway singing ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and immediately thought ""I've GOT to see this movie!""<br/><br/>As it turns out, I was right before, and that scene is the ONLY thing worth seeing in the whole 2½-hour movie. Some of the music is beautiful, but all of the lyrics are moronic, like something a twelve-year-old might write.<br/><br/>But even if the original French lyrics are much better, this story just does not work set to music. I know the musical was hugely successful, but I still think it's a big mistake. I'm giving Hathaway three stars."
"user-196-766417","6","0","1","2 January 2015"," A fairly good adaptation but with a poor choice of singers.
","Les Mis is a great film adaptation of a great musical. Under Tom Hooper's direction, the cinematography, costuming and setting are breathtakingly amazing and contextually accurate. The characters and plot stay true to the musical, which is heartening to see when so many film adaptations like to make changes.<br/><br/>There is, however, one slight problem.<br/><br/>The singers.<br/><br/>It is obvious that these singers have been cast for their big names and the reputation that they bring to the film's marketing, rather than the strength of their voices. If you have never listened to either the 10th or 25th anniversary concerts, their voices may be passable, but as an avid listener of the 25th, I thought most of the cast's performances were weak.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is obviously unable to reach the high notes of songs such as 'Who Am I' and 'One Day More', and is unable to hold long notes. He also seems to lack control, demonstrated in 'Bring Him Home'. The song is supposed to start off gently and quietly and build up to an epic climax, but Jackman belts the song the whole way through, ruining the pleading and ponderous tone of the song.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's performance as Javert is lacklustre in the fact that he is unable to emote Javert's firm authority. In 'Fantine's Arrest', 'Confrontation' and 'Stars', Crowe drags his notes on, removing the power and strictness that a crisper staccato would bring.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway, however, emotes too much. Her acting ability is absolutely amazing as Fantine, portraying her struggles and her desperation brilliantly. However, she extends this too much to her singing, and the result is a boring rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' that is so spluttery it's difficult to listen to.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit as Marius and Enjolras (respectively) lack power and conviction in their voices for the roles of the revolutionaries. However, I do think that Redmayne delivered a decent rendition of 'Empty Chairs At Empty Tables'.<br/><br/>Interestingly, although people complained about Amanda Seyfried's voice, I thought it suited her character. It is sweet and gentle and plain, which reflects Cossette's innocence and purity. <br/><br/>Samantha Barks as Éponine is amazing, probably because Barks played her in the 25th anniversary concert and has had previous theatre experience.<br/><br/>In short, Les Misérables is a good film adaptation, but the choice of casting makes it lack the emotional depth and poignancy that other productions have had. The only redeeming features of the music were the epic choral songs and the beautiful orchestra."

","Tom Hooper's movie of ""Les Miserables"" is by far the biggest disappointment of the year and, in fact, one of the year's worst films. It wouldn't have been this way if the worthy project had been given to a different director.<br/><br/>The original stage musical has been justifiably loved by many and won many awards in its various languages. Though flawed by its paucity of melodic creativity (there seems to be one song that keeps reappearing throughout with small variations) and a tendency toward over-bloating the material (Javert dies not from an ignominious death in a canal but a leap from a height that rivals the top of Mount Everest), the original musical was a masterpiece of adaptation from the Victor Hugo novel.<br/><br/>The movie captures that accurately and perhaps beautifully but the beloved property has been undermined and eventually destroyed by the most incoherent and pedestrian film direction I've witnessed in at least a decade. In short, the film is a mess due to Tom Hooper's insistence of dizzying, relentless close-ups of grotesque singing faces spasmodically darting about, and his total inability to place two or three people into an organized and meaningful composed shot. Establishing shots are completely absent, and no attention seems paid to any visual relationships between characters, the organizing of which is a prerequisite for any director.<br/><br/>One searches in vain for any intelligent use of space here, as Hooper haphazardly frames faces off-center, too high or too low, as if a child or a disabled grandparent inadvertently picked up the camera and aimed it without being able to see its image through the viewfinder.<br/><br/>In the hands of a competent director a simple conversation (or a duet) between two lovers can be a thing of significance and beauty in which we experience one lover declaring love at the same time we experience the reactions of the other lover simply listening, but here all we get is one face at a time repeatedly shoved into our mugs in an assault as if an out-of-control jack-in-the-box puppet is out to get us. This is no way to convey the subtlety or sensitivity of a marvelous property like this epic musical. It only remains to see if the aficionados of the original have the good sense (and the imagination) to realize what this film could have been -- and how much they've been short-changed as well as dishonored.<br/><br/>Sorry this functions as a mere footnote, but a word needs to be said about the singing. In essence, some are inadequate for the task (Crowe's weakness bothers me less than Jackman's irritatingly uncontrollable vibrato) but a few are marvelous (like Samantha Barks and David Heddlestone). However, it is truly Anne Hathaway's earnestness and heart-felt singing that towers over the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>And in the future I can only hope that any project I value doesn't fall into the bungling hands of Mr. Hooper!"

","Normally I do not prefer writing negative critics about a movie. However, this time, after spending almost 3 hours I could not keep myself from writing a couple of words about the movie. <br/><br/>First of all, no one should start watching it with a great expectation. Given the fantastic novel, one may consider that the movie would be breath-taking with some famous and respected Hollywood stars. But the movie is too far from being breath-taking. I only liked facial acts of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe while I found Anne Hathaway's facial acts ""unnatural."" <br/><br/>I love musicals, I love them a lot. But for God's sake, what was that music? Throughout the movie, I could hear good sound for only 3 or 4 times! The remaining was just repetition while the repetitions were with poor quality. Anne Hathaway rescued the musical part only with one song of Elaine Page. She really gave emotions and we could hardly learn a bit about her character. To me, almost all musical parts were forced. Take Moulin Rouge for example. There are many conversations in it and you don't feel weird while watching. Most of the songs in that movie were unique. On the other hand, this movie made me feel that they wanted to make a musical and they just composed some cliché sounds to rescue the day! I never liked the music and at some point, it disturbed me. <br/><br/>I gave 4 for the sake of some rare good features. This is absolutely not a movie that I will keep in my movie DVD archive."
"gauvinma","5","0","1","15 March 2014"," It makes me sad to see what Hollywood has done...
","First off, I have to say that I love Les Miserable. I first saw it when I was only 9; I was a kid that hated musicals, but I absolutely loved this one, the story, the music, everything was perfect! That being said, I was very excited to see this movie in an updated, high budget re- creation. I have to say I was very disappointed. The directors for this movie seem to be confused about the difference between a musical and an opera. In musicals, there is music, and people talking in-between, kind of like Sweeny Todd (which I also enjoyed). An opera, has people singing everything that comes out of their mouths. I do not enjoy opera for this reason, and it is THIS REASON that I simply cannot take this movie. Even my fiancé, who enjoys musicals far more than I do couldn't stand watching this train wreck. Casting was okay, and the portrayal of the characters was good. There were a few weak moments from some of the actors, but on the whole they pushed out good performances. As some of the other reviewers (those not under the employ of the studio) have pointed out that some of the story line is not well explained. More attention needed to be put into explaining why Javere would jump from a bridge from being so conflicted about turning in a parole breaker who saved his life, or why Cosette would be so enamoured with a fellow she saw one from a distance, but couldn't be without. These are little things though, they don't bother me as much since I already know the storyline and understand the characters. I can only give this 6/10 in good conscience. I almost feel like demanding another version without all the idiotic singing of conversation, but after winning Oscars, I know this will never happen. Too bad, this could have been an amazing work of art, but instead just became a mediocre Hollywood attempt at a masterpiece that I can't even bring myself to watch again."

","Other than one song by Anne Hathaway, this movie was simply a mess. Most of the music is like fingernails on a chalkboard. Russell Crowe has a fine voice for pop/rock but it doesn't fit this operatic style. Hugh Jackman also has a great voice normally but he was out of his range and style as well and he has a huge musical presence in this.<br/><br/>The completely sung dialog between the major musical pieces was obviously penned by a 1st grader in the style of ""I am so and so. I live in this place. I'm a good guy but had this thing happen. Look how special I am...."" I've never read the book and have no idea if the original story has so many references to God and religion but this director certainly emphasized it to the point of feeling preached to.<br/><br/>The director also decided shock and grossing out the audience was more important than any character development and story. In the end I felt no sympathy for any character deaths and I'm generally full of empathy. <br/><br/>Save your nearly 3 hours instead for a colonoscopy."

","Okay, let me stress that I have almost no idea of the whole plot or characters of Les Miserables, I have not seen the stage show and I have never read the book. I saw this film because my mother LOVED it. She was stressing to me how fantastic this one was and how Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar etc. The end result was my questioning whether this really was the musical of emotion and feeling.<br/><br/>The plot is that Jean Valjean is a prisoner on parole but can't get a job because the warden, Javert, has stated that he is a dangerous man. In a time of rape and murder what was Valjean's crime to make Javert so obsessed? He stole a loaf of bread...From what I have been told thats in the play too but it becomes insane when this character torments Valjean for 30 years and his crime was stealing a loaf of bread? For the musical of feeling, I feel no character motivation for that to happen.<br/><br/>Okay so Valjean breaks his parole and becomes mayor in 8 years in a jump cut that quite frankly happens so fast that it doesn't seem real at first (great development there guys!) and is called into his factory to settle a dispute between Fantine and the other workers. The Forman kicks Fantine out and because she has a daughter, she sells everything she has to provide for her and it eventually leads to the famous ""I Dreamed A Dream"". Whats my beef? We only know Fantine for half an hour of the entire film. We should care...why?<br/><br/>Javert notices that the Mayor looks a lot like the criminal he's obsessing over and after a total of 3 conversations he notices that it IS him. Valjean, however, tries to respect the wishes of a dead Fantine and raise her daughter, Cosette who is being raised by Sacha Baron Coehn and Helena Bonham Carter whose characters are named...<br/><br/>Cut to a mere 9 years later, we see Cosette as a teenager who falls in love with a boy named Marius at first glance. Marius is in the Revolution which is led by his friend whose name is...<br/><br/>However Eponine (I'm not sure how its spelled and I'm too lazy to look it up) is in love with Marius and happens to be the daughter of Sacha Baron Coehn and Helena Bonham Carter and like many love triangles, the person that doesn't have the happy ending is given the most development. After Javert finds out that he has an obsession over Valjean again, Valjean decides to leave Paris...9 years there where Javert could come in at any moment and just NOW he decides to leave. But this upsets Cosette because shes in love with Marius who is beginning to build the barricades for the revolution. After they are delivered a note from a little boy who is one of the revolutionaries and is named...() anyway Valjean reads the letter and decides to help Marius in the revolution.<br/><br/>Anyway the revolution goes belly side up, the revolutionaries are killed with the exception of Marius who is rescued by Valjean and taken to a hospital. Javert questions this act of kindness and his own morals which causes him to kill himself. Marius and Cosette marry and Valjean dies being carried away by the spirit of Fantine.<br/><br/>What is my major problem with this movie? It has WAY Too much story. I have seen films that clock in two and a half hours and they have nowhere near this much plot. Its like if someone tried to adapt the Dark Knight movies in one condensed version. The plot is so overdetailed and so overdone that I don't feel a single moment where I connected with the characters and for a film thats title can be translated into ""The Miserable Ones"" to include no reason to care is a huge crime.<br/><br/>The cinematography for this film is awful. I can name three different shot types that take up the majority of the movie; close up, tracking shot and crane shot. Because this film is shot so boringly and has no reason to connect with the characters, the whole film just becomes boring. Even the action scenes, its so tightly shot that you can NEVER see whats going on.<br/><br/>I also don't think we need comedy in a film called ""The Miserable Ones"" I mean sure, Sacha Baron Coehn has his fans but his comedy in this film consisted of stealing things and Helena Bonham Carter raping Santa...this begs one question from me as a viewer ""What the hell am I watching?""<br/><br/>The only other real complaint is the live singing. I think the director used this as a gimmick to start some sort of musical trend...the reason why it never took off was because it produces horrible singing. I swear, the only really good singer was Hathaway and even then I like her performance in the final song, not I ""Dreamed A Dream""<br/><br/>In terms of films I didn't like, I have seen worse however this film just didn't work. I have never seen the play and this film committed the worst crime an adaptation can make, it turned me off to an even more extent.<br/><br/>Overall if your a die hard fan, go see it, it doesn't mean you're an idiot but I'd prefer a version with more emotion please.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh and if you want my personal recommendation, go and watch the Les Miserables that was made in 1998. It sacrifices such things as comedy and unnecessary plot points in exchange for...emotional development, explanation of character motivation, beautiful cinematography. I wont spoil it for you but if you want to see what I'd call a good version of Les Mis, go for the 1998 version."

","I am a literature not a cinema scholar, but the narrative methods of films fascinate me as they allow for a different way of storytelling. I am also of the opinion that a film based on a book – novel, diary or memoir – should not be judged based on how close it is or how faithful it is to the narrative that inspired it. Literature and film are two different ways of imitating reality and they rely on their respective tools – equally valid – to express the reality they create. In a way, comparing the two is like comparing painting and photography or theater and opera. That being said, I think that those of the critics who complained about this movie for not having been entirely faithful to Victor Hugo's novel missed the point. This is a film inspired by the musical, not by the book. It's that simple.<br/><br/>But more than that, Les Miserables is a refreshing take on an old story. The recent Hollywood drought of stories, lack of inspiration and bad writing have led to the revival of a number of classics, but for the most part the only contributions consisted of added special effects. Not so for Les Miserables. The movie is a cinematic take on a musical, which makes it very close to a filmed opera with the added benefit of moving sets.<br/><br/>There is a lot of courage in this new perspective on Jean Valjean's story. First, there is the aforementioned courage to make the movie so close to an opera. As an avid opera lover, I am sad to admit that opera does not seem to satisfy the appetite for entertainment of most audiences today, having been replaced with the more visually strong television, movies or computer games. So, making Les Miserables a long filmed opera at the risk of not making it a blockbuster was an act of courage, and one promptly attacked by some of the newspaper film critics.<br/><br/>Second, there is the audacious use of makeup in combination with close-ups of the main characters filmed while singing – which seemed to have been very unpopular with a lot of the critics. In a time when we are uncomfortable to say the least with movie actors not looking perfect, yellow teeth, moles and saliva filling the big screen are a sure way to get infantile reactions of disgust. In our naval-gazing society, we'd rather not idolize and identify with imperfection. However, the lives of the characters in this story are, indeed, ""miserable,"" and what better way to show that than through their decaying bodies? Last but not least, Les Miserables chose not to sanitize the revolutionary spirit that animated more Hugo's novel than its multiple Broadway interpretations. Valjean's is ultimately a story of injustice from an unjust time, a story that rightfully ends with a major rebellion, the Paris commune. To eliminate that side of the narrative because it makes audiences uncomfortable is to take away its entire social manifesto. Whether we like it or not, this is a 19th century version of the ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement (as one critic astutely put it, only to emphasize her distaste for it), as disorganized, haphazard, leaderless and doomed to failed as its 21st century counterpart, but filled with the same amount of desperation and ideals.<br/><br/>I, for one, can only hope that Les Miserables will open a new page in the way we do film: more engaged, more meaningful, more social, more thought-provoking."
"annuskavdpol","7","0","1","1 January 2014"," A great movie, and interpretation of Victor Hugo's book.
","The film-maker of this film is a great visual story-teller. He used triggers to link pieces of the story together weaving everything in such a creative way as to honour Victor Hugo and at the same time remaining true to his own craft (namely making movies). For example, the future king had a gold ring. This gold ring appeared in the middle of the narrative, then again closer to the end and then at the end of the movie itself. The visual linking of the gold ring hooked most parts of the story together and weaving them together with such finesse. The story, Les Miserables by Victor Hugo is a complex one, but the movie explains it like the stories of the bible on the stain glass windows in the Middle Ages did to people when they visited the church. The one downfall in this movie is the special effects. I think I would have preferred some of the landscapes to have been authentic landscapes versus a 100 % reproduction. Other then that, all and all a very well-thought out visual experience."

","SAILING IN France. In the beginning, there are about a thousand homeless guys pulling a ship on dry land. I guess that's how they sail in France. So, one of the homeless guys gets paroled and the guard tells him to watch himself. The parolee is a guy named Jean Valvoline. They don't say why his Mama gave him a girl's name or if he is related to the oil fortune. Come to find out he stole some bread. I didn't know they called it bread back then. Anyway, the guard, a guy with one only one name, Shove'it, has it out for Valvoline. REDEMPTION. After visiting a church, Valvoline goes straight and in about eight years becomes a mayor and owner of a sweat shop (kinda like Mary Rose Wilcox). A chick working there, Fatima, gets sideways with some bitch and gets put on the street. Eventually Valvoline goes out whoring, finds her, takes her to the doctor and adopts her kid. Go figure. But guess who shows up, the cop, Shove'it. What a plot twist. THE PLOT THICKENS. Here is where it gets hard to follow. Valvoline can save an innocent, homeless guy by showing up in court, but he will lose the adopted kid, who is by now, a hottie. Somehow Valvoline gets out of it, gets to stay with the kid, (her name is Croquet). Before you know it more years fly by while Valvoline and Croquet seem to be in witness protection. Then, wouldn't you know it, a bunch of college kids start a revolution. And who shows up? You guessed it, Shove'it. Never mind that, Croquet sees one of the college kids, a trust baby named Mario, and of course, they fall in love. (Mario has a chick hanging on him by the name of Epitome, but that whole thing is too confusing for this summary.) REVOLUTION! Not so much. As you know French army surplus rifles are great buys because they are usually un-fired and only dropped once. A bunch of the college kids are killed and a few uniformed Frenchies, but no revolution. The population pretty much stays home drinking wine and eating bugs. For the nerds reading this, Les Mis begins in about 1815 and ends about 1832. The French Revolution occurred in three phases, ending in 1804 with Napoleon. No revolution to see here, just the June up-rising. THE END. Magically, Croquet and Mario find each other, and Valvoline goes to a convent to croak. I figure he knew something about the nuns we don't. Everyone sings and it's bye-bye Valvoline. Apparently Croquet and Mario live happily ever after in a mansion with a yacht pulled by homeless guys. STORY NOTE. Wonder what ever happened to Shove'it? For some reason the guy making the movie thought the audience would care and it turns out Shove'it is a jumper. Splash, no more Shove'it."

The song is awkward because of the strange accent: like the music's written for the word EXTRA to have only two syllables. But he made it sound like three, EX-TER-RA, plus he rolls the r's so it almost sounds like four syllables and he has to catch up to the music. And what is he doing in this movie anyway?

And although they have a top American cast in this movie, that doesn't make them good singers. Jackman's/Crow's singing is hilarious at moments. The original lyrics and music, which this movie follows rather truthfully, revolve around music and lyrics, and not so much around acting and context.<br/><br/>There are many time-gaps in the original that are filled in by the movie – which might be a good thing for understanding Les Misérables. So yes: the musical is much more difficult to follow, especially if it is not subbed or seen for the first time without knowing what it is about. But at the same time in the musical there are many contextual gaps which are left to the viewer's imagination, but which are filled in by acting and (mediocre) special effects in the movie. Even more, because there are simply way more gaps than the movie can fill in its 2h30, they make the movie look very shallow. So in a sense everyone sees ""his own"" Les Misérables during a musical, but we all see the same movie, and this does not appeal to us all."

","This is like the ""crud I've been too busy watching Fame before my Julliard interview next week"" version of Les Miserables... This was the modern opera at its peak; a complex classic story telling of tragedy and characters a midst conflict. You have to remember there were giant cats running around on stage for the first time when this became an irreplaceable masterpiece; it doesn't get any more dramatic and polished than this. I did see it with original casts at that time on Broadway and in London, and the human voice is a crucial part of the chorus and the characters. Although the acting is well done, the voices drop out constantly, leaving this element as lackluster as the overly gritty costumes and sets. Hugh Jackman keeps it afloat, but Sacha Baron Cohen is not funny once again, only this time it was at a crucial point needed for comic relief. The main flaw with this movie adaptation is the lack of focus on characters, emphasized by the absence of their voices. Drama is something the stage can produce with professional ease, and we are without it for the movie version. This problem is best summed up with Garosh, whose lines got cut down instead of his character; he is the spirit of this revolutionary war, the main theme, the only boy among all the men, and if you have any emotions for the opera and the idea of tragedy, his character should have been the tear jerk-er. Instead, he rushes onto the scene as a nuisance and stays that way to the viewer until he is rushed off. The idea of camera is also at fault as we are zoomed through this lengthy story, not allowing any time for breathers or for focus through simplicity. In conclusion, this did to Les Miserables what Snyder did to the graphic novel Watchmen: What happened?!!! Personally I kept thinking about that Futurama episode with Leela's boil."

","Musicals are not my thing. Up until now I have seen only 2 that worked: Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Julliet (yes both Baz Luhrman's). With all the positive reviews and the high IMDb score I was willing to give it a fair chance...but after 5,5 mins I had reached the limits of my patience, I HAD to turn it off. This is just unbearable! Do they really have to sing EVERY SINGLE LINE of dialogue? No wonder this thing clocks in at 158 mins. It's better to burst out into song for no reason then to continuously pound people in the face with them. Some performers are great actors, sure, but that doesn't mean they have a great singing voice. Be realistic, no one is good at everything. I guess this film has a certain audience (it made 433 m$ worldwide) but I'm pretty certain I'm not one of them."

","How many of you have actually read Hugo's Les Miserables? Very few I would imagine. I would have to include the writer of this musical adaptation of the work. Well, he adapted from previous movies for he follows the last three films very well.<br/><br/>Musicals elicit emotions and mix spoken and musical moments to carry the story. The writer does a fair job but not a good one. For example in one scene Jackman follows a spoken part with a brief two lines of song which are confusing for both him and the viewer. This is followed by a wonderful singing part by Crowe.<br/><br/>The DeLorean was a wonderful and beautiful car. However, it was a piece of crap to drive because the designer failed to understand the relationship between a motor's horsepower and the weight and design of the automobile. This movie fails in the same manner.<br/><br/>It is entertaining and the insertion of several pauses over several days allow the viewer a wonderful experience. It is also good to prepare food by, kind of like listening to a radio in the background. It has brilliant moments which are shadowed, if not overshadowed, by poor production and writing."

It was one of the movies where I found myself constantly checking the time to see how long until it was done.<br/><br/>Fair warning, I'm not a big Les Miserables fan (if you hadn't already guessed). I've seen the Liam Neeson version which I liked a bit (more than this version) and that's it.<br/><br/>I also thought it would be a musical film similar to Chicago in which the songs added to the movie periodically. I did not realize that it is literally 24/7 singing wherein every single line is sung.<br/><br/>That was unexpected to me - if I had known that I probably wouldn't have watched it.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is great as the main character, really believable and a great, charismatic actor.

","I didn't know much about Les Mis, having never seen it at the theatre. But when I heard the rave reviews being given for the new, all-singing cinema release starring Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway, I really wanted to see it. Seeing the cinema release would be my chance to find out why Les Mis had always been so well-loved. <br/><br/>But somehow we didn't get to see this new film and in the meantime my husband rented the non-singing version of Les Mis, starring Liam Nesson, from Lovefilm. I was enthralled. It was fantastic! So well acted. So memorable. Moving. Believable and insightful. <br/><br/>Strangely enough, the school where I was temporarily working were also doing a performance of Les Mis - a singing version of course, and I spoke to the stage director and he said to see the school version and you wouldn't need to see the latest film. He was kind of, right. The school's actors and singers were brilliant. Great singing. Great heart. And not having heard the songs in the Liam Neeson film version, it was lovely to say, aha, that's where those songs I've heard people singing on Talent Shows comes from and fits in. <br/><br/>Eventually, we rented the Hugh Jackman version and all I can say is, it didn't hold a candle to the Liam Neeson one or even the school-play! Not good singing or acting (except I could feel passion and enthusiasm in Russell Crowe's performance beyond his singing capabilities). But Hugh Jackman? He is no Jean Valjean. Not good acting, singing or stage presence. I could not believe in him as a convict or as a good upright mayor of the town. His singing was high and screechy and I really didn't like it, though I've heard him sing on chat-shows and he sounded like he had a good voice. His singing actually annoyed me in the film. I didn't mind anyone else's voice, they all did okay and some singers were very good. I particularly liked Marius. Also, why the Irish or sometimes Scot sounding)accent from Jackman? Was he trying to play the part like Lim Neeson? Probably...but he failed. <br/><br/>I watched the film through to the end. My husband slept. Now I can justify thinking of Liam Neeson from the 1998 version as THE Jean Valjean and Geoffrey Rush as THE Javert. 10 out of 10. Excellent. The best I've seen out of three different renditions. This one is the one I will always remember. See this classic for yourself, if you haven't already. Don't bother with the 2012 version. Not really very good at all."

","This is not a filmed version of the stage musical. I understand that. And while, the rearrangement of the plot is awkward at times, I can forgive that. What I find impossible to forgive is the casting of certain parts. Though his voice isn't as powerful as it should be, Hugh Jackman is good as Jean Valjean. Russell Crowe can't sing worth a damn. Ann Hathaway acts her part successfully but her voice isn't particularly good. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helen Bonham Carter don't exactly ruin the comic highlights of the musical but neither of them is a singer. To my taste, Samantha Barks as Eponine is the only singer who could have stood up to his or her stage counterpart. Frankly, the only emotion my wife and I felt when the film ended was relief. The highlight of the film is the opening scene where the convicts are hauling a battered vessel into dry dock. After that, it's pretty much a pale imitation of the stage version we saw. I did, however, appreciate the scenes in which Colm Wilkinson appeared. He was ""our Jean"" Valjean and, though too old to play that part now, a better singer than Jackman."

","When the stage show appeared, everybody raved about it, but I didn't have time back then. I did notice, however, that unlike Evita, Sound of Music, etc., no songs from Les Mis were ever played on radio. Now I know why: the whole thing consists of a series of tuneless recitatives. The one song with a melody might have appealed to Australians as it was a variation on a song most learn in primary school - I found myself singing along ""One Night While Travelling Sheep..."". The effects were very good, and it was excellent from a dramatic point of view, but apart from Valjean and Javert, it was hard to keep track of who was who. I can't imagine how Hathaway got best supporting actor when she could only have been in about a quarter of the film, and the credits didn't tell us who played who - thank goodness for IMDb."

The only thing beautiful about this movie was the trailer, because at least the trailer had emotion... not once did I feel anything for the characters, not even Fantine when she died. The movie didn't have a real character development, just like songs from now the story lacked meaning. There was no true beauty it was just a long and overdone song. Another thing, could this movie have picked a worst singing cast, Anne Hathaway was amazing, but Russell Crow, I couldn't even watch the movie to the end because of his putrid singing (if that's singing is).

It is funny in the DVD bonus section the director tried to tell us Russell crowe is a good singer. Come on, we all can hear. If you make a casting mistake, just admit it.<br/><br/>Casting Russell crowe in this movie kind of ruined the musical. The fault is not with Russell crowe, but with the people who cast him.<br/><br/>The children actors also don't sing very well. If you watch TV talent shows you know there are children who can sing as well as adults, so I wonder why they don't cast children who can sing.<br/><br/>Another gripe I have is sometimes they sing a conversation, without a melody.

So now, months later, I get the DVD thinking that some control in viewing might help -after all, this thing is so well liked that maybe it was just not my day. No. No. I know that comparing the book with a movie is unfair, so, just one detail: Cossette is in the dark carrying a bucket heavy as herself and the burden suddenly becomes light. This, in the book takes more than a page to tell -Mr. Hugo, no brevity anywhere. For me that image was one of the strongest in the book. The movie ruined it to an idiotic trivialization. Someone could use the visual strength of this movie, with modest effort improve on the music, and give us ""The Toilers of the Sea"".

Why does Hollywood spend all that money to make a musical and then not use singers? They did it again with Les Miserables. In even the opening song ""look down"" there were many notes missed. Of the primary stars the only one who came close to singing the part well was Russell Crowe as Javert. Hugh Jackman would be OK at a party singing beatles tunes but he does not have the strength or range for the role of Valjean. Neither of the Threnadiers (Helena Carter and Sacha Cohen) can sing.

","To start with: I love the Musical, always have, always will! Unfortunately living in Germany I have to travel to London to watch it in English (which I have and will do again) as the German translation kinda sucks (IMO). I don't agree with either the high praises or the worst critique of the film. It was an okay version of the musical. So critique time: As a fan I had the highest expectations of the film. It turned out to be a so-so experience though. Some parts I liked (Anne Hathaway did a good job, Daniel Huttlestone and Samantha Bark's performances as Gavroche and Eponine were brilliant), some parts I hated a lot (singing everything, turning dialogue into badly written, badly rhymed pretend versions of the musical, Amanda Seyfried (she was awful!!!), Sacha Baron Cohen, who seemed to have lost all of his natural charisma and don't get me started on Helena Bonham Carter, WTF!!! I love the innkeeper's wife usually but this was just awful!). SPOILER!!! Another thing bad for me was that one of the most memorable scenes from the musical has been turned to be about Jean Valjean. Just after all the students (apart from Marius) have been killed on the barricades, there is an iconic minute or two when you just hear sad music and the barricade twisting with Enjolras spilling over the top. I know it shouldn't make me feel good but that scene always does. It makes me think of all the young people standing up for what they believe in and yes, sometimes dying for it but ultimately making a change. In the film version it just showed Enjolras for a couple of seconds and then it was back to Valjean. I guess people having seen the musical will get me. So rant is over. All in all I enjoyed the movie but prefer the stage version. Still, the movie is only based on that so in the end, it was okay."

","I am a Les Misérables virgin, meaning I have not seen any other performance or adaption of this story before.

They do live up to their name and reputation - the performances of the actors are astounding and I have never had more respect of Anne Hathaway, who finally had the chance to show what an amazing performer she is. As far as acting, the only negative I can comment on is that I feel Russell Crowe was an extremely wrong choice for this role - I am sure there are plenty others who would be a lot better for this particular film. What a shame.<br/><br/>As far as directing goes, I was disappointed how Tom Hooper didn't use more in his arsenal than close-ups and zooming in and out. Also, making the actors sing every single word (well, at least 98%) was a bit too much.

"seaview1","8","0","1","10 March 2013"," The Triumph of the Commoner in LES MISERABLES
","There are musicals, and then there are musicals. This adaptation of the smash Broadway show, itself sourced from Victor Hugo's classic novel of the post French Revolution and the suffering plight of the populace has been transformed into an impressive film which will appeal to those open to its free flowing style of song and music. Think of this type of musical as operatic narrative with hardly a spoken line of actual dialogue. For the uninitiated and fans of traditional movie musicals, this may take some getting used to. If one can embrace the format, it is a well made, emotionally moving tale of love and hope.<br/><br/>Spanning the years 1815-1832, in Paris, France, the years following the French Revolution have left the country divided with its common citizens in poverty and hard labor. A prisoner, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), is paroled under the watchful eye of policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe). Stigmatized by his record, Valjean flees his past and makes a new life for himself as an upstanding citizen until a chance encounter exposes his identity to Javert, and the hunt is on. Meanwhile, in a related incident, a factory worker, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), has been unjustly fired and must struggle to survive and care for her young daughter, Cosette. As Fantine must resort to desperate measures and all hope begins to fade, Valjean intercedes, and while Cosette grows into a woman (Amanda Seyfried), their lives intertwine with a movement to rekindle the Revolution as a growing revolt pits commoners against French soldiers even as Javert closes in on his quarry. <br/><br/>Through these characters, we witness a wide range of behavior from treachery and betrayal to loyalty and unrequited love. It's also about the secrets and the choices made especially by Valjean who comes to a series of crossroads in life. Jackman does a great job of conveying shame, guilt, desperation and anger, but those feelings give way to wanting to be a better man. His Valjean is the conscience of the film.<br/><br/>Hathaway owns her role as the doomed Fantine and has the chops to sing the signature song, ""I Dreamed a Dream"". Her character's descent into hell is not unlike the doomed characters in The House of Mirth or Sister Carrie. Crowe has the unsavory role of the obsessed Javert but proves an effective foil to Jackman. The folks that made TV's The Fugitive must have modeled Inspector Gerard on Javert! <br/><br/>The storyline has numerous supporting characters and subplots including one involving a pair of crooked innkeepers played with villainy by Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. (What's with these three name actors anyway?) There is also a nice musical, montage sequence that alternates and merges several different settings and characters; it is directly reminiscent of the pre-rumble sequence in West Side Story. <br/><br/>Production values are outstanding with the set designs realistically recreating 19th century Paris (with parallels to Dickens' London settings) befitted with costume designs of the period. The camera-work relies heavily on hand-held close-ups for realism. Of note, this is one of the few musicals that did not loop the vocals in post-production. Rather, the actors actually sing on camera, and fortunately they all acquit themselves well with these terrific songs. The effect is more akin to witnessing a live, stage production. <br/><br/>The end is memorable as wishes and legacies are fulfilled. When you figure the resources and talented cast directed by Tom Hooper (the King's Speech) that brought this to the screen, it is a remarkable achievement. Because of the theatrical source material, however, just be wary of the way it's all presented, narrative and all. ""Vive la France!"""

","Several things are written about this movie. Tom Hooper took a risk by taking a subject so close to the audience that the comparisions were bound to happen. Still after seeing the movie, one is not disappointed. The credit goes to Hooper for taking a subject and expressing the emotions of the situations and story in such a manner that one gets hooked on to the musical and goes on a journey till the end. Of course the time of the movie may be a concern for some, but once you get engrossed to the movie, you will not care about the time. A big round of applause to Tom for delivering the best performances from each of the cast, This definitely makes him a worth nominee for Oscars.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances of the movie, The act is top notch starting with Anne Hathway and Hugh Jackman. Well desereved nominations for Oscar. Though Anne had a small role, but the time when she sings I dreamed a dream......makes you feel the pain which she is going through. Its great to see an actor who once started with Princess and now has delivered a performance of a lifetime. She deserves to win an Oscar.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, what to say, The man comes as a great surprise after his highly impressive X men movies. He surely can sing and gives a marvelous performance, Jackman has the best songs and emotions to emote, and he does it flawlessly. You can see a change of a man's life through his entire journey. Even the voice which changes in the ages for Jackman and to show it on screen in a detail manner is remarkable. <br/><br/>What comes as a surprise is Amanda and Eddie. Amanda gave a surprise by that voice, she should really take up some Broadway musical or cut and album for that voice. Eddie is like the dark horse, you can see the man evolve from My week with Marlyn till Les miserables, he sings well, emotes well, and look great, Here is a great actor in making. The romance between these two is the only happy part of the film which makes the movie not a documentary. Same holds for Samantha, First thing to notice is the tiny waist, Don't know how much waif look the actors acquired for getting in the characters, to show the hunger and pain. She acts great and sings great, she is the most surprising package of the movie, She plays eponine like a pro. Your heart goes out to her specially in the scene when Amanda and Eddie meets for the first time, and Samantha is singing with them emoting how much she loves Eddie and cannot get what she always wanted from him. Sacha and Helen have the good parts to be funny, and that's what makes you laugh at some point and enjoy the emotional rollar coaster ride called Les Miserables. Many things are told about how bad the singing was of Russell Crowe, But it is impossible to say that he did'nt act well, You will not find any fault with him, Its just the perception of people because of the hype created around the movie and knowing the Broadway performances and then comparing them with Russell, I would say, People please give the guy some credit of singing and playing his part well.<br/><br/>The sets cinematography, costumes, makeup all deserves a point to be noted as everything was upto perfection and done on a lrge scale. For a musical movie lover, the movie is a cheese cake. Go and Enjoy the movie.........and get lost in love, sacrifice, revlution,songs, ambition..........thats what life is about."

","I had been looking forward to seeing this from the moment the trailers were released and while there were a lot of positives (most of which gushing reviewers have covered many times over) but it was ultimately a little disappointing.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me was that everything was robbed of context making it hard to connect with the characters. The framing is reminiscent of a film that has been badly cropped for television! Most of the musical numbers are close up head shots... all well and good but you never really feel that the characters exist in a era that has a profound effect on them and gives them an emotional connection with that same world. There are very few long shots and those that there are are disappointing or fleeting. The editing goes from non-existent in the main numbers to a bit choppy the rest of the time with little in between. It could have been epic but instead they have managed to take something relatively small scale (the stage production) and made it feel smaller and a lot more cramped. They should have opened up Victor Hugo's visions of France but instead it feels like you are getting a glimpse through half drawn curtains.<br/><br/>The passage of time is also poorly dealt with, condensing the whole production into a slightly frantic affair. I think complaints of its slow pacing are dues to that fact that (despite a few genuinely compelling performances) you might not really care about the characters. There is little evidence of the true oppression and hardship besetting the world the characters live in due to the 'singing heads' nature of the camera work. A few more minutes setting the various scenes would have helped the pace rather than hinder it.<br/><br/>All that said it is entertaining and there are some very good performances, the lighting is generally good as is the digital grading (not too severe for the most part).<br/><br/>7 out of 10 from me as I appreciate the live vocal technique used and it was a reasonable (if slightly frustrating) trip to the flicks.

","Right after I saw this movie, it was clearly a 10. Then I chewed on it for a couple of days and came to the conclusion that during the movie version, I never got emotionally attached to some of the performers, except Jean ValJean and Javert - since they were so prominent. But Cosette, Marius, Eponine - the love and emotion was not felt between that triad because those scenes constituted such a small fragment the movie. I had concluded that the theatrical version was better because 1. there were no visual distractions, thus slowing the story down and allowing you to connect to the characters. 2. the vocals were better - the movie was good, but the theatrical version much better, 3. the live orchestra pierced through your body better than a megawatt surround sound system. 4) don't discount the impact of lighting at a theater, a main light on one person performing invokes different senses.

The film-sets and special effects are completely absorbing and firmly teleport you to historic Paris, the costumes and make-up are impressive, and the fancy camera angles and tricks make for a hypnotising watch – but the real triumph is the acting performances. Hugh Jackman proves his skill as a serious actor, especially in the first 20 minutes – he's fantastic. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, (albeit a little close to her character in Sweeny Todd) provide very welcome relief from the intensity of the movie, and I must admit, I fell madly in love with Eponine and the actress who plays her (Samantha Barks), the instant she hit the screen. But Anne Hathaway and ""I dreamed a dream"" ?!... I don't think I've ever stared at a screen so hard. Utterly engrossing. And it was only towards the end of the song, I thought ""Hang on...was that just one continuous take?"" That alone, is a reason for me to watch this movie again. Russell Crowe in my opinion, was the only strange casting. I'm not his biggest fan, I admit, but his singing was doubtful, and he is wooden and emotionless almost throughout – maybe part of the character, granted, but far inferior to the others on screen.<br/><br/>So, what other reasons for not giving this 10/10? Well...the whole movie is just too long and intense. The lack of spoken dialogue sort of lends itself to this style, since the music throughout the movie, is itself, highly passionate and intense – but it's almost as if there is no beginning or middle to this movie, only a 2 ½ hour finale. The lack of much spoken word ensures that this high emotion is relentless to the end. It's fairly exhausting. I found myself looking at my watch. Am I too fussy? Maybe. Especially since I enjoyed it as much as I did, while not being an avid musical fan. To finish with a slight cliché, this is a real ""movie going experience"" so go see it on the big screen if you can – you won't be disappointed."
"Sir_Dancealot","7","0","2","8 February 2013"," Les Miserables, honest review
","A tale of a prisoners' trials upon release and his struggles to do what is right in difficult circumstances and harsh times.<br/><br/>I had read a couple of reviews of this before hand and also had my Mum (Normally a good yard stick for my own views) wax lyrical about Tom Hooper's latest film.<br/><br/>I saw the stage musical when I was very young and had luckily forgot the story and plot before watching. I had high hopes for this as I thought The King's Speech was superbly crafted and Mr Hooper got some great performances from his cast. I watched it at The Ritzy in Brixton and it went out of sync a couple of times, but I will put that completely out of mind for the purposes of this review.<br/><br/>I thought it was great film making, again. The acting was first rate and I got emotional at all the (hopefully) right bits. Shooting close ups of the cast is a way of immersing you into the narrative in a way a stage musical doesn't.<br/><br/>My only problem was with some of the voices. Hugh Jackman was outstanding as Jean Valjean and I would find it hard to think if anyone else as him from now on. But he had a tendency to sing through his nose, and it grated on me, the other person who I thought wasn't up to the singing was Amanda Seyfried (Cosette), again great acting, but her voice was shrill and if you compared her to Samantha Barks (Éponine) as her love rival, I wondered why on earth Eddie Redmayne (Marius) would chose Cosette over Éponine. Although Mr Redmayne's (Again, brilliant acting) voice rubbed me up the wrong way when hitting the strong notes.<br/><br/>I think a very honourable mention should go to Daniel Huttlestone great as the 'little tyke' Gavroche. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were also superb and their comic timing is fantastic.<br/><br/>I put spoiler alerts on this for two reasons. One because I have given away a small plot line, but the other is because I didn't want people to be listening out for the voices that I didn't like, if you can watch it without them grating on you, you are in for 9 out of 10 movie. I can't and it did spoil it for me a bit."
"JamesHitchcock","7","0","2","6 February 2013"," The Blood of the Martyrs
","Most cinematic musicals these days do not fit the traditional Broadway model, that is to say a story told through a mixture of spoken dialogue and songs which serve the plot by commenting on the action or revealing the characters' emotions. Modern musical films generally depart from this model in one of a number of ways. In some (e.g. ""Fame"") the characters only sing in situations where people would sing in real life. In others (e.g. ""Mamma Mia!"") the storyline is contrived to fit a collection of pre-existing songs which were not originally written with a musical in mind. And Les Misérables"", like ""Evita"" from the nineties, is the sort of operatic musical which is entirely sung, with no spoken dialogue at all. <br/><br/>Victor Hugo's vast, sprawling novel might seem too complex to turn into a stage play, but in fact the musical by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg has provide a huge international success, produced in 42 countries in 21 languages. The plot is a complicated one, if less so than that of the original novel, but essentially it tells the story of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who becomes an honest man after a religious conversion, and his efforts to bring up his adopted daughter Cosette. Valjean's efforts to reform, however, are threatened by Inspector Javert, a zealous police officer determined to return him to the galleys for breaking his parole. <br/><br/>The film has two main faults, although these are, to a greater or lesser extent, shared with it source material. The first is that the music, both in the theatre and in the cinema, has always struck me as insufficiently varied. Most of the numbers, whether what we are listening to is ostensibly a love song, a satirical comic song or a revolutionary anthem, seem like variations on the same theme, even if they are not. The second fault is that it can be quite shamelessly and manipulatively sentimental. It is sentimental about religion, about politics and about obnoxiously cute children. The actress playing the young Cosette was quite sweet, but the film's Gavroche must be one of the most repulsive screen youngsters for many years. <br/><br/>Although Hugo regarded himself as a freethinker rather than a practising Catholic by 1862 when he wrote ""Les Misérables"", the film has a general air of specifically Catholic religiosity throughout. Valjean's conversion comes after he is saved from arrest by the intervention of a saintly bishop, although even before this event he is not what we would today think of as a criminal; his original ""crime"" was to steal some bread to feed a starving child. I have always thought that it would have made for a more effective story had Hugo made the pre-conversion Valjean a genuine villain; it would have made his conversion more dramatic and might have explained just why Javert is so obsessive about pursuing him. (I am sure that the French police in the 1820s had more pressing priorities than the theft of a loaf some thirty years earlier). <br/><br/>The film's sentimentality about religion is inextricably linked to its sentimentality about politics. For reasons best known to himself, Hugo used his novel to mythologise not the famous French Revolution of 1789, or even the less famous although successful revolutions of 1830 and 1848, but an otherwise obscure event, the June Rebellion of 1832, a failed attempt by an unholy alliance of republicans, Bonapartists and legitimists to overthrow the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe. In reality the majority of the French people, reluctant to see a second violent change of government in less than two years, refused to support the insurrection, which was crushed in two days, but here it is presented as a heroic act of self-sacrifice and the revolutionaries are, quite literally, portrayed as Christian martyrs. The song with which film ends, ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" contains the line ""The blood of the martyrs shall water the meadows of France"", a deliberate echo of that even more sanguinary line in the ""Marseillaise"" about impure blood watering our furrows. <br/><br/>Musically the highpoint is the rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" by Anne Hathaway; in the context of the story I would rate this higher even than the celebrated version by Susan Boyle. Hathaway's voice might not quite have Boyle's power, but she brings to the song a pathos which brings home the plight of her character, Fantine, a factory girl who through ill circumstances has been reduced to poverty, degradation and prostitution. Hathaway has been nominated for the ""Best Supporting Actress"" Oscar, and would be a worthy winner. I knew that Amanda Seyfried had a good voice from ""Mamma Mia!"", where (musically at least) she was the only one of the cast to emerge with any credit, but I was favourably surprised by both Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, neither of whom I would have thought of as the musical type. Jackman's rich and sonorous voice is well suited to his characterisation of Valjean as a man of great integrity and courage; Crowe's voice is rather harsher, but again this seems appropriate to the driven Javert. It would be too simple to see Crowe's Javert merely as a villain; he is an officer of the law, determined to uphold it at all costs, but he allows this otherwise laudable goal to become a dangerous obsession and to blind him to other moral duties. <br/><br/>Tom Hooper quite deliberately brings a dark, moody look to the film, as if to emphasise the harsh lives of its characters and the fate against which they struggle. The music may not be very varied, but it can have a great emotional power, particularly when performed by Hathaway and Jackman. Overall the film is not a bad one- it is well directed with some good acting performances. I just wish that it had been a bit less keen to wax sentimental about the shedding of blood in a dubious cause. 7/10"
"dario_malic","7","0","2","5 February 2013"," A little change is always welcome
","Often these days prominent filmmakers decide to tell a story already told. Sometimes even a story told multiple times. Whether it's for a lack of ideas or because of their love of the subject and confidence they can make something special out of it is debatable, but whatever the reason the expectations from such endeavour are always high. That was also the case with the latest of that kind, Tom Hooper's Oscar hopeful ""Les Misérables"".<br/><br/>Adapted from a famous musical play which was in turn based on the novel by Victor Hugo (both having the same name as the film), the film retains the musical form and does it in an unusual way, with actors singing and recorded live during the shooting. It makes for a somewhat uneven experience due to the difference in actors' vocal capabilities and dependance on the conditions at given time. While the acting is solid across the board, more famous names like Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen or Helena Bonham Carter do mostly mediocre work singing-wise. Fortunately the young ones: Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Aaron Tveit and Daniel Huttlestone, save the day with some great singing. And then there's Anne Hathaway with the performance which there's no sense in writing about but really just has to be seen.<br/><br/>Technically the film is very good but has some minuses. Production design, cinematography, and editing while generally good make some scenes, especially those with the barricade, feel staged. That's probably the legacy of the play, which doesn't work as well in the film. That applies to parts of the story and some of the songs too. I don't know to what extent Hooper and the screen writing team (in which there were the authors of the play among others) stuck to the play but the theatricality is sometimes too apparent. Costume design on the other hand, as well as makeup and hairstyling, is as great as you would expect from a high budget period piece like this.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned, there's little done to escape from its predictability. I imagine the screenwriters didn't want to steer too much from the source material, but they even didn't have to. A lot would be accomplished with just a little different balance of the themes. The revolution part of the story is left underdeveloped in spite of some striking scenes while too much time is spent on Jean Valjean's lamentations and a sense of thematic connection between the two is, I feel, not properly addressed. Also the relationship between Javert and Valjean is shown mainly as one between the hunter and the hunted while there's much more to it. For example, Valjean as the symbol of change is locked in the seemingly endless battle against Javert as the man who can't break from his own constraints. However, the end comes and Valjean emerges victorious, showcasing that a change will come despite of presently suppressed revolution. All of that and probably more is present in the subtext but Hooper unfortunately failed to put any emphasis on it.<br/><br/>While the singing presents the story without any difficulties and make for some truly rousing scenes, its occasional lengthiness slows the film down making it unbalanced and overlong. In addition to a couple of overly pompous scenes, that degrades ""Les Misérables"" turning it into a good movie instead of a great one it could have been. It's a shame, but it is what it is. At least we can hear the people sing.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

That was a bold move.<br/><br/>I don't think much of Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. Neither her acting nor her singing grabbed me. I liked Isabelle Allen as young Cosette, though. She was absolutely perfect looking and didn't have to do that much acting. <br/><br/>I agree with everyone who said it had pacing issues. It didn't flow well for me at all. I wish the loaf of bread theft had gotten more than one quick mention at the beginning.

","I'm not a Les Mis fan particularly. I saw the show live about 20 years ago, and was less than impressed. I remember not being able to understand many of the words. I found it all melodramatic, a little tedious. The whole thing is sung. I don't think there is a single word of dialogue. It's a modern epic opera with a few great songs.<br/><br/>However, this movie performance of Les Mis brought the musical to life for me, and even quite moved me (both of which are strange considering its stylised and artificial nature). I enjoyed this movie much, much more than I enjoyed the live performance I saw. I think it's partly because the movie was subtitled in Dutch so I could follow every line. <br/><br/>I was really surprised to be so moved by this movie. Who would have thought? I suppose you could say that I now finally get Les Mis.<br/><br/>Putting it on film was a great idea and Hooper and his cast have done this classic justice. Jackman and Hathaway really stand out as great singers and performers. No one who sees this movie will ever look at these two actors again in the same way. I'm a huge fan of Crowe, a talented actor and singer, but I feel he was miscast here. I don't see him as the complex evil/tragic Valjean figure.<br/><br/>I would give the movie a 9 or 10, were it not for the fact that I'm not particularly a Les Mis fan."

I was really let down by this movie maybe I was expecting something completely different but overall was left feeling that this did not belong on the big screen. There were some notably stand out performances but it just didn't seem to quite gel for me. Maybe some of the characters didn't fit in. Someone really needs to tell Russell Crowe that he can not sing whether it was Hugh Jackman singing too well that made Crowe look bad I don't know but it was definitely visible. Th story moved along well but it lacked that extra kick and every time I thought it was about to ignite into something spectacular it would just slow right down again. Cinema in my opinion needs to be cinematic and as my fiend pointed out it just didn't offer anything cinematic the close ups the shaky cam and loudness of certain scenes just didn't sit well. It's a shame because for all the good the movie did show it was quickly put in its place by the poorer elements. I'd even go as far as to say was this a movie at all or was it just one large set after another trying to be a moving piece of dull theatre? Maybe the theatre is the best place for this story and the cinema should reserve the right to be a place for true cinematic art."

","Okay, well. I went to see this during Christmas week, and it was a fabulously movie. No doubt about it.

I was crying when she sang ""I Dreamed A Dream"" (which has become one of my favourite songs of all time). Hathaway's character in the movie is the most pitiful and sad.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks as Eponine is a relatively new actress and this is my first time watching her perform. She actually surprised me with her acting and singing skills when she sang her number ""On my Own."" All of the other actors gave a decent performance in the movie including Hugh Jackman and Eddie Redmayne.<br/><br/>Even though the movie was great for the most part, I was disappointed with some things, most notably the dialogue being sung all the time which did give me a headache at one point in the film.<br/><br/>Another thing I was disappointed in was Russel Crowe's awful singing.

"nkskipper92","7","0","2","26 January 2013"," Jackman isn't Wilkinson. Crowe is somewhat miscast. See it anyway.
","David Letterman once said that everyone who has hosted a late-night program in the last 30 years has been trying, in vain, to be Johnny Carson. Similarly, everyone who has played Valjean in the last 30 years has been trying, in vain, to be Colm Wilkinson. Hugh Jackman is no Colm Wilkinson, but he's not really trying to be - his performance breaks out of the vocal and emotive mold that Wilkinson created for the role. It's different and, once the audience gets past that, fairly well done.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's singing, such as it is, will make no one forget Philip Quast or Norm Lewis (I frequently found myself wishing they had gotten Lewis, who played the role in the 25th Anniversary concert) but, taken on the merits of the acting (disregarding the singing), Crowe has a decent (not great, but decent) showing and, particularly in one scene after the second attack, stays true to Hugo's vision of the character, if not Boublil's and Schonberg's.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway kills and buries her Disney legacy with her turn as Fantine, which absolutely deserves every accolade it has received. It's not pretty. It's not refined. It's ugly and brutal and hard to watch (in keeping with the character and her story) and it is riveting. She has set the standard for future actresses in this role. Period.<br/><br/>As for the Thenardiers, it's a different take than the loud, bombastic performance you see on stage, but again, they're not on stage, and it works fairly well. As well, this is the first Sacha Baron Cohen performance I've thoroughly enjoyed, and I wish he would do more things like this, and less playing with feces and calling it piercing social commentary.<br/><br/>Speaking of doing right by Hugo, the final scene is beautifully done and pays a wonderful homage to the both the novel and the play. If it doesn't leave you at least thinking about being in tears, check your pulse.<br/><br/>In summary: if you've seen the stage show, don't expect a line-by-line faithful adaptation of the stage show. Expect to enjoy, but not be blown away by, the vocal performances of anyone not named Anne Hathaway. But if you allow yourself to move past those limitations and be immersed in the movie, do expect to enjoy yourself, and probably to be moved to tears more than once.<br/><br/>If you've not seen the stage show, it may help to familiarize yourself with its basics, but then the same applies."

","First let me say that I have seen the Broadway musical three times over the years. When performed well, the play is a moving experience filled with memorable moments of music.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be a disappointment, probably because I expected (hoped for) so much. It's not a bad film, but I think it could have been more.<br/><br/>The idea of live singing is a noble experiment. In some cases, it lends authenticity to the performances and melds the singing with the emotions. But, I think, it required rephrasing of the songs to make them more realistic. In doing that, it compromised the emotional impact of the songs.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the realization of Paris and the surroundings of the story. The costuming other production values were excellent. However, choices in editing and camera work were distracting. One should not be so overtly aware of these choices.<br/><br/>In the end, I wish the director had dubbed in voices for two performers. Russell Crowe's Javert is a strong presence in the film, but his voice simply did not convey the same strength. And Cosette's (adult) voice could have been stronger.<br/><br/>I recommend the film, but I wish it had been more powerful. Compare Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge, where he used actors, not Broadway performers, but managed to create a powerful experience. Some might say he overproduced the songs, but the music was stirring and carried more emotional impact than the naturalistic renditions in Les Mis."
"thesanibanani","9","0","2","24 January 2013"," Interesting Angle
","When I first heard they were going to do a new ""Les Miserables"", my first thought was who was going to play who and whether or not it was going to be a musical.<br/><br/>I've got to say, the cast surprised me in many ways, both good and bad. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean started out very questionable, but once he sang ""Suddenly"" after retrieving Cosette, he melted my heart away and I finally realized he was doing a great job as Jean Valjean, just a very different one from others I've seen so it was hard to get used to. Anne Hathaway as Fantine was hard to believe, until she sang ""I Dreamed a Dream"". Again, it was a very different way of singing one of my favorite musical songs, but I went with it and she convinced me, nearly had me in tears even.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, by far, was the most disappointing part of this movie. Having read Les Miserables (by Victor Hugo), Javert became possibly one of my favorite storybook characters of all time. Crowe nearly butchered him to death. His singing was not the worst I've ever heard, but it just did NOT fit in with this movie. It was not operatic, it wasn't Broadway. It was... having a few beers and testing out karaoke night. I don't know why someone cast him as Javert, but it was absolutely horrendous. His facial expressions were believable, at times, but in general he just was not a good choice for this role. At all, no excuses.<br/><br/>The second weakest link of the chain is Amanda Seyfried. She wasn't any Cosette I've seen or read about. She just seemed sort of ditzy. Not like her Mean Girls character, but not very relatable. I didn't really care about her at all. A story like this where she's pretty much what EVERYTHING is circling around, you want to at least sort of like her. I didn't really care what happened to her, no sympathy for her without Marius, no happiness when she got him.<br/><br/>Samantha Barks as Eponine was REALLY good. Her version of ""On My Own"" was truly brilliant--especially that camera work with the lines about the lights and the rain... you guys ;).<br/><br/>Finally, the crescendo of this movie I felt, was Eddie Redmayne as Marius. I first saw him when the movie started, looked at my boyfriend in the theatre and scowled. Who is this weakling trying to play the noble, but confused, Marius Pontmercy!?!?!? But in the end, WOW! Blew me away completely. Very, very strong voice to my COMPLETE surprise!! Also as a side note, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were hysterical and gave just the right amount of comedy to one of the darkest dramas I've read. They came in at the right moments, and bless them for their ""Master of the House"" scenes!!! In addition to them, Aaron Tveit as Enjolras was really great.<br/><br/>To conclude: Watch this movie for Hugh Jackman and Eddie Redmayne. While others in it are good, these two were the carriers and without them I would be giving this film a much lower rating. My standards might be high, but this is a very popular story and needs to give the world justice.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - Les Misérables is the classic story of Jean Valjean, a man who is hunted for many years by the ruthless officer Javert, after breaking parole in 19th-century France. He promises dying factory-worker Fantine to take care of her daughter Cosette. It is a story about belief, honour, debts, love, and revolution.<br/><br/>There is an amazing cast assembled here, and the talent is splattered across the screen. There's incredible acting, and astounding singing (some people get all the talents). Especially Russell Crowe as Javert and Anne Hathaway as Fantine stood out to me as being exceptionally great. Their characters go through some intense emotional hardship and this is performed remarkably.<br/><br/>Les Mis' production design and -value is also exceptional. Both the grandeur and squalor of 19th century France is showcased remarkably well in huge sets with incredible detail. Not to mention the huge amount of actors, in especially the revolutionary scenes, really sell the experience.<br/><br/>As this is a musical I can't ignore talking about the music and lyrics. I have never seen any other adaptation of Les Mis, and went in to the movie with absolutely no expectations or preconceptions. I was pleasantly surprised with the beautiful story, which is transferred really well by the music and lyrics. However, it is quite a sit-through. The movie runs over 2,5 hours, and with the exception of a few lines of dialogue, everything is sung. Lines such as ""Where are you?"" and ""Help, I am stuck under this cart!"" are all sung. This does wear on you in times, and perhaps elongates the runtime more than was necessary. On the other hand, it's a musical, what do you expect? I hate to be too critical here, as I did like the overall movie-experience, but the cinematography was abysmal at times. There are certain choices that the director made that are unfathomable to me. Among others, there is a severe overuse of hand-held camera-techniques. This humanizes the audience, and lowers them to the level of the characters, placing the audience within their midst (as opposed to the 'eye of god'). I can understand this in and of itself, but combined with some of the other techniques creates a feeling quite separate from the intention of the story in the movie. Deliberate off-kilter framing and dutch-angles are used multiple times. These are used to create a sense of uneasiness and tension in the audience. Very effective, and amazing when used at the right times, but completely misused in Les Misérables. Here they appeared in scenes involving love and happiness. Although I doubt the average movie-goer notices such things consciously, I believe it would subconsciously detract from the emotional connect the audience makes with the on-screen characters, and the movie-nerd in me was not happy.<br/><br/>Having said that, emotional connect is in no way an issue with Les Mis. There are some incredible scenes where, using a constant close-up and one long take, a character gets to pour his/her heart out to the audience, and this is felt through the bone. Anne Hathaway's ""I dreamed a dream"" springs to mind as an example. During what must be a multiple-minute long constant take Anne sings the entire song in one take, whilst performing an incredible range both emotionally and vocally. (Singing whilst weeping hysterically can't be easy). I can neither confirm nor deny a heightened moistness of the eyeballs at this point.<br/><br/>Les Misérables is quite the show, grand in design and performances. Its long runtime and excessive singing do make it a formidable watch however, certainly not for everyone's taste. And thus, even though my personal feelings would suggest a nine-out-of-ten rating, I want to be somewhat objective here, and suggest you only watch this if you are interested in either musicals or the story of Les Mis in general. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com"

Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman), who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert,(Russel Crowe) after he breaks parole, agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's(Anne Hathaway) daughter, Cosette(Isabelle Allen/Amanda Seyfried). I have to admit, I wasn't expecting to enjoy a musical but this film re-enforced that you can't fully enjoy a movie with an open mind. Enough about me, onto the movie.<br/><br/>This is an all star cast and these are some top notch performances especially by Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Russel Crowe and Samantha Barks(Who surprised me, for some reason I was very impressed with her role). Anne Hathaway's riveting performance as Fantine completely captivated me, every second she was on camera with such raw emotion and brilliance - I was blown away. Hugh Jackman was phenomenal as well with his leading role, a very commanding performance and again, with great emotion. They each sang with such passion and intensity. I was highly impressed with each and every actor's performance in this film.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed how each theme - Dream. Hope. Love and Fight were incorporated into the storyline and brilliantly brought to life. Fantine's DREAM for Cosette brought to life because of Jean's HOPE for a better future and the LOVE and FIGHT of Marius. The songs were written well to suit each character. I loved the costumes and the fact this this movie wasn't made out to be too glamorous so that it would keep the real feel of what the characters were going through at the time.<br/><br/>I was really impressed with this film and I enjoyed its as a real emotional roller-coaster. Les Misérables is a must see for anyone who is interested in a truly exceptional film."

","This film was certainly the best of the year! Enjoyed every moment of it.<br/><br/>I only wish one thing, for it to have been sung and performed in the French language (with subtitles). We audience are ready for that. The sound of the French solo voice singing is a glorious and wonderful sound to listen to. It is one of the finest sounds the human ear can hear, the mind can listen, and the heart and the soul can feel. This would have made the film perfect. and it would have got my first 10/10.<br/><br/>My reasons for saying this, is due to countless people I have spoken to who actually believe the story was all based in England ... Yes, they were actually serious. I was gutted with shock upon their lack of education.<br/><br/>I'm still shaking my head (at them)."

","This movie is good, but isn't great. My only problem with this movie was the ""musical on screen"" thing, and as that took up 90% of the movie, I didn't think it was that great.<br/><br/>The cinematography is superb. Very good camera work, one of the best features of the movie.<br/><br/>Acting is also superb. Emotional, dedicated performances from most of the cast. Dialogue is good (even though there was barely any of it)<br/><br/>Soundtrack of course was excellent. Some very good numbers in there, although there are some moments in the film that would've been better suited as dialogue, instead of a cappella singing.<br/><br/>If this film was just a film (not a musical) I probably would've loved it. I just didn't really enjoy the constant singing on screen. Only two songs actually suited their role on screen, the rest just seemed a bit weird in a movie. I probably will much prefer this in a theater.<br/><br/>The scenes with dialogue, or just music and no singing were the best, but they all came to about 15 minutes in total. I just wish there was more of it, instead of four songs in a row with no dialogue between them.<br/><br/>If you like the concept of musicals on screen, this is great. If you don't, should probably avoid it."

","A excellent film which brings out every emotion, superb vocals and the best acting I've seen in a long time. Anne Hathaway brings a new life to her character and Hugh Jackman brings many emotions to the movie.Its a film witch will make you laugh (thanks to Helena Bonham cater ) and cry thanks to Samantha barks beautiful rendition of on my own, witch in my opinion rivals Anne Hathaway's version of i dreamed a dream for the most beautiful song in the movie. A superb remake of a heart retching story. <br/><br/>Hollywood remakes aren't normally as good as the original stage production or the book, but the crisp sound and high definition screens really brought this film to life, i personally think that this is the best reproduction of this story to date, and Hollywood should attempt more musicals."
"Christian_Dimartino","6","0","2","19 January 2013"," It's flawed, but there is a good amount to admire.
","Out of the nine Oscar contenders this year, I have only seen three. So I need to get cracking. Yesterday I saw one of the top ones, Les Miserables, is a film that has a few strong qualities and a high amount of ambition, so I can't help but admire it in some way. But yet it is far from perfection.<br/><br/>Based off of the popular musical(which is based off of Victor Hugo's popular novel)Hugh Jackman plays the film's hero, Jean Valjean. Valjean, imprisoned for stealing a piece of bread, breaks his parole and begins to live a new life again. But it only lasts a certain while. After he meets a poor young woman named Fantine (the remarkable Anne Hathaway, will get to her later) and begins to take care of her daughter Cosette (the older version played by Amanda Seyfriend, who honestly doesn't get to do a whole lot), Javert (Russell Crowe, who should probably stick to what he does best), the cop that imprisoned him, sets to bring Valjean back down once again.<br/><br/>I liked the first forty minutes or so. But once it flashes forward another eight years, I began to get exhausted. The film is non-stop singing, which might not be a bad thing if everything was worth singing about. You can tell that Jackman just wants to talk. He would be saying something like,"" I would to have a..."" and then immediately switch over and sing,""HAMBURGER!"" I'm not the biggest fan of musicals. I love the dark and depressing Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. But at least that movie has conversations. Just when you think a conversation is going to arrive in Les Miserables, someone always has to get my hopes up by singing.<br/><br/>I admire what they have done with it. There is so much effort put forth. But a little too much. It sort of feels like everyone involved knows that this puppy is going to get an Oscar nomination, and surely enough, it did. The latter half of the film had some interesting moments, in particular, the ones with Jackman, and not the ones with Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne, who plays her lover. The latter's scenes lost my interest.<br/><br/>But there is so much to admire here. Jackman is as marvelous as ever, and though some films hold back his gifts, Les Miserables lets him display them. This is one of his best performances, definitely worth an Oscar nod. Then we have Anne Hathaway, who is so obviously going to win her a much deserved Oscar. Why? This one amazing scene where she sings ,""I Dreamed a Dream."" Never before has a musical number been so astonishing. In fact, when I was starting not to like the movie, I always thought back to that scene, and it saved the movie. ""I Dreamed of Oscar"" would've been a more appropriate title.<br/><br/>Then we have the comic relief of Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as a couple almost too desperate to make money. HBC and SBC, two Sweeney Todd alumni, are hilarious here, and I looked forward to every scene with them. Even with the glumness of a musical like this, they make it funny.<br/><br/>Les Miserables is the second film from Oscar winner Tom Hooper (The King's Speech). Is it as good as that one? No way in hell. Yes, he tries so hard here. But there doesn't need to be this much effort put forth. Sweeney Todd was a depressing musical, and that film worked perfectly.There are a few fantastic moments here, but not nearly as many as Sweeney Todd.<br/><br/>I give kudos to Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, and Sacha Baron Cohen. But whenever their not on screen, someone in the background should've yelled,""Shut up!"" to those who were. I think it's worth watching on DVD, but the length feels longer than World War I, so I don't think it should be seen in theatres.<br/><br/>B-"
"CelluloidRamblings","7","0","1","19 January 2013"," I liked it, but it could have been better...
","Nominated for a total of 8 Oscars, it's difficult to not go into this film with ridiculously high expectations. Not only have you got Tom Hooper at the helm, whose previous film 'The King's Speech' swept up the Academy Awards just two years ago, but you've got the likes of Catwoman, Wolverine and Maximus Decimus Meridius belting out the tunes made famous by Susan Boyle. And it's a musical. A musical. How's that going to get an audience? It's just a case of ticking all the right boxes. For the women, could be the best weepy since Titanic; for the lads, well, you may need a little more convincing. But it's certainly safe to say that fans of the stage production will be wholeheartedly satisfied.<br/><br/>Much like a subtitled film, it takes a little while to get used to the cast singing almost every single line of dialogue, and the film doesn't gradually work it in either. The opening scene is a sweeping long shot of a ship being hauled into harbour by bald and bearded convicts. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is among them; he stole a loaf of bread which resulted in a 19 year sentence. Javert (Russel Crowe) tells him that his parole has begun, making him a free man. However, when Valjean breaks his parole following a religious redemption, Javert embarks on a life-long mission to capture the elusive Valjean.<br/><br/>Watching this is like a wave of unsubtle emotion crashing over your face for 158 minutes, but it is somewhat refreshing. In a baron cinematic landscape where 'epic' usually means a lack of character, it's comfortable knowing that Hollywood still know how to make 'em how they used to; load, vast and unashamedly sentimental. However, the constant tear-jerk emotional reactions that the film is constantly trying to provoke, especially in the second act, becomes unintentionally grating. Also, some of the songs become extremely tedious; after all it's only musical theatre, no Bizet. Not only that, but there are times when the second act seems rushed, almost as if you barely know the characters that are meeting their demise. But that is not to take away from the astonishing raw power of the first half. Anne Hathaway steals the show as Fantine, providing a lump-in-your-throat rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' caked in tears and snot. If she doesn't get the Oscar this year, there is something wrong with the system.<br/><br/>Overall it's an enjoyable, solidly crafted movie, but it's not the weep-a-minute that so many of us were expecting. The second act doesn't live up to the brilliance of the first half, but nevertheless, it's a useful reminder that musicals are still alive and well. <br/><br/>My Blog: www . celluloidramblings . blogspot . co . uk"

","What I Thought: I thought this was a very fine piece of movie making. I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but I love the story and remember reading it as a child. I have my favourite parts in the story such as the exchanges between Javert and Valjean. The music is very stirring and extremely well performed by the actors. Hugh Jackman who has a history of musical performance is excellent as the main character Jean Valjean and he is aged very well throughout the course of the film. One of the few negatives I had read about the movie was the performance of Russell Crowe. I think this is a little unfair as I thought he was brilliant as Inspector Javert; his singing is consistent and for me he was one of the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway's role in the film as Fantine is major plot point, but her screen time isn't that long and personally I don't think her part is big enough to warrant a Best Supporting Actress nomination, although she is superb in the role and sings beautifully. The design of the film is expertly done and you can see that a lot of work has gone into making this a big contender for awards this year. I enjoyed the movie, but mainly because I like the story and some performances pleased me.<br/><br/>Conclusions: Very well made, some great performances and very true to the book as I remember it. Les Misérables will definitely win some Oscars this year.<br/><br/>For the full review and more movie reviews visit - http://smurfdok.wordpress.com/"
"moh_hamade96","6","0","2","18 January 2013"," A kind of movie that leaves a mark, but could leave a bigger one!
","Les Misérables! Indeed a miserable experience. A nerve-wrecking, sorrow-enhancer roller-coaster, that describes the miserable tale of Jean Valjean played by Hugh Jackman and his journey towards rehabilitation, and vengeance on the inspector who ignited his torturous 19 years of jail sentence. The inspector, namely; Javert played by Russell Crowe. On the way he encounters obstacles in the form of a burdened mother Fantine played by Anne Hathaway, a mother working tiring hours to support her father-less daughter. It is indeed a mother load of ambiguous talent. A 157 minute movie twisted, swirled and squeezed with remarkable singing and acting talent. Entertaining as it may seem, it is probably the only problem of the movie. It is, without a doubt an eventful movie, a movie manifested with conflicts and events; Jean's life in prison, Fantine's experience with the injustice of the country, jean's coral with Javert, Cosette and Marius's lovestroy, and on top of that the French revolution, that arguably resulted in the viewers not being able to bond mentally with the events. The viewers should adhere with the chain of events; we should be one with the characters; experience what they're experiencing; we should bond with the them. A bond was undoubtedly felt with Jean Valjean and with Fantine, I felt their pains and sorrow I was down when they were but not with the rest. Cosette and Marius's love was thrown out there just to associate the chain of events with that of the novel. Love of their standards was not felt it had the caliber of an epic love story; however, dull as it may be I felt more love in the lucky one! And that is saying something! The French revolution is such an epic twist in history, such changes it brought to the present, displayed effectively and ineffectively. A flame of entertainment was, frankly, kindled but the flame of bonding was extinguished hurriedly. It was joyful to watch, but the young men responsible for this revolution should be portrayed in such a manner where the viewers could trust them with their life, they are the men that will lead the past to the present, they have entrusted themselves with a mature duty! To be blunt, I didn't feel I could trust the to fetch me a loaf of bread! My journey with musicals is somewhat bumpy, at best. I believe their mimicking of life is neither sufficient nor effective. But with this movie, I have reached the peak of the bumps. They have collected an acting ensemble, a hurricane of manpower that the director was able to coherently connect them and display this work of art! It is deadly difficult to connect camera movement, with the music and with the characters movements, yet so easily mastered. The move to sing and act, rather than lip singing is what made the movie so vividly displayed. Tom Hooper has done an excellent job going with the characters initially! When Valjean sang Valjean's Soliloquy, and when Fantine sang I Dreamed a Dream. Those two were the peak of the movie! The ending performance resembled a remarkable child in a room filled with ignorant ones. The ending was sadly associated with a poor middle that didn't give the ending the hype it deserved, yet it delivered to reach the peak of the movie! The character profiling of Jean Valjean, was uniquely good! William Nicholson showed how a person would have times of wisdom and good judgment, and moments of self-centeredness, Everyone has a fluctuating character; a personality not consistent to one bad or one good but multiple ones. And that was Jean Valjean! I shall not take anything away from the acting. Ability to sing and act; adjust the vocals; the ups and downs simultaneously with the expressions; adjust the body movement keeping in my mind not to go off-track with the lyrics, such actives were so greatly exhibited by the entire crew. Hugh Jackman! If actors were presidents, he'd be the president of Australia. Such talent will lead the future; he will hold the lamp for the future, clear the path for a race with dominating intentions! I believe his performance placed Mel Gibson's performance in brave heart in his tiniest pocket! If that's not Oscar caliber I don't know what is. Every moment of the 157 minute I have not seen a wolverine I have not seen a hairy beast! I saw a different person I saw jean Valjean. That is what distinguished and determines good acting from lousy ones. In the future when Anne Hathaway is mentioned expect your skin to be invaded with dominating Goosebumps, your legs attacked by strength , forced to stand, your arms forced to raise on your forehead and offer your salutations to magnificence made into a body. Long has she been described as the next Julia Roberts; well unless Julia could perform like that, then that statement is a disgrace and an insult to Anne!! I envy the Oscar critics this year; they have the easiest job in the world! Just give it to Anne Hathaway! A blockbuster movie? With these acting legends, yes definitely! A kind of movie that leaves an emotional mark on you, but with this man power they had the ability to strike your heart with a scar! Just a clear image of what to expect!"
"donb-519-335075","7","0","3","17 January 2013"," Unfortunately . . . . disappointing
","I'm sure my expectations were too high. Les Mis is our all time favorite play - we have seen it a number of times on the stage & on videos of the play. Unlike some who were disappointed by the singing (which in the case of Russell Crowe especially) was not good - that gave the movie a dose of realism. And a number of the cast were excellent singers (A Hathaway - Sasha Baron Cohen - Aaron Tevit - and Samantha Barks) but the rest were so - so.<br/><br/>The two highlights of the movie for me came early in the production - Hugh Jackman's great acting/singing after he is given a break by the man of the cloth - as he contemplates turning his life around - Pefection; and Ann Hatheway's ""I dreamed a dream"" after being raped (it certainly was not consensual sex). As far as I am concerned she stole the show (Susan Boyle creep back into obscurity). She acted the song while she sang it - for me the highlight of the entire movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the rest of it did not measure up. In fact I was quite bored with some of the transition scenes - the director should have known that less is more. Maybe they could have kept the movie closer to 2 hours without some of these scenes which were not really needed.<br/><br/>One good thing: they got to the crux of Valjean's issues quite quickly - I have seen a few of the plays where it takes 15 - 20 minutes (or so it seems) to get to the stirring opening chords - and on with the actual story.<br/><br/>Now I contradict myself. Russel Crowe's problem is that he did not project the focus and determination - and self doubt that I have seen in many of the plays as Javert. And I believe the reason he did not do so was because his voice was weak - not up to it. In the play, ""Stars"" is a moment which really stirs the blood as we see how Javert sees the world - which sets up the questioning and self doubt expressed especially after Val Jean gives him a break. It it takes a butt kicking manly voice to project the certainty and power that Javert has - until the very end. Poor R Crowe could not hack it. In my opinion there was enough star power with H Jackman, A Hathaway, and A Seyfried to interest the audiences - one more star who barely sings better than I do (well - that's going a little far) was not needed - and I think put a damper on the whole movie.<br/><br/>I'm glad I went (& only paid $5) - it is a good movie - the story of redemption is timeless - and the music is the best. Again - I just think I expected too much. DonB"

","First of all I have seen the stage version 3 times and love it. However I feel the movie was good, but not great. My negatives are Russell Crowe when he sang, Amanda Seyfried also. Anne Hathaway was good - not great. Hugh Jackman was better. I feel Sacha Baron Cohen was miscast, but Helena Bonham Carter was good. However the best to me was Eddie Redmayne - his version of Empty Chairs and Empty Tables was the best I have ever seen. My main problem with the movie is how it was filmed - it is a movie of close -close ups and it was hard to watch after awhile. When the camera went back to the whole scene - or half of it- it was easier to watch. I much prefer being able to see the whole scene - not just the face of the main character at the time. The music is fantastic - the orchestrations were worthy of the music. There is so much going on in each scene and I think Hooper could have done that better. I will see the stage version any chance I get - but not the movie version."

","Les Misérables is one of the biggest musicals in the world, being performed on the West End, Broadway and every major theatre district in the world and had countless tours around the world. But it took over 25 years of development hell for a film adaptation to be made.<br/><br/>Based on Victor Hugo's epic historical novel, Les Mis the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a convict who had served an 18-year sentence of hard labour after committing a theft. After breaking his parlour he receives the hand of Christian charity from the Bishop of Digne (Colm Wilkinson, the original Jean Valjean) and Valjean seeks to repay his kindness by devoting his life to hard work, charity, religion and seek his redemption. But Valjean is constantly hunted by a determined police office, Javert (Russell Crowe). Along the way on this 17 year story Valjean ends up adopting a young girl Cosette (Isabelle Allen), the daughter of one of Valjean's former workers Fantane (Anne Hathaway), who is forced into poverty and prostitution. And in 1832 students plan a revolution and one of them, Marius (Eddie Redmayne) falls in love with Cosette as an adult (Amanda Seyfried), a man whose best friend, Eponine (the beautiful and talented Samantha Barks) suffers from unrequited love.<br/><br/>Fans of the musical will love this adaptation. The casting for the most part was spot on and the songs are in tack. There are only a few minor changes in the order of the songs and it works for narrative sense. Most of the critical response has been very positive and the majority of the negative reviews are from critics who admit they never liked the musical in the first place (which makes you wonder why are they reviewing it if there opinion is so bias).<br/><br/>There is a great cast in this adaptation, from big name stars to up and comings to two very talented child actors. Hathaway was best performer, giving a heartbreaking performance as a woman who is broken and her version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" will become the definitive version. It was also great the filmmakers took the risk of casting an unknown to play Eponine brought in Barks (someone's casting I somehow predicted). Barks gave a star making performer that was full of emotion and it is somecase of how different directors can get different performances from the same actress. Barks' performance at the 25th Anniversary Concert was more powerhouse with a strong delivery whilst in the film it was more gentle. This was most noticeable during her performance of On My Own to small moments where she sings lines like ""every word that he says is a dagger in me"". I like bold version.<br/><br/>Jackman is a man who started as a musical performance before he landed some small comic book role. He gave an excellent performance, both acting and singing and he gave his all for the role. Redmayne was also of the best Marius' ever. Many of the signature songs were song fantastically and given justice. But there is one big fat elephant in the room: Russell Crowe. He was obviously cast because of his big name, not because of his singing ability. To be fair he was fine when he was singing with other actors because he was working with and reacting to them, acting more then singing: but when he had to do his big solo numbers he was unable to hold the high notes.<br/><br/>Director Tom Hooper took the bold step of getting his actors to sing live on set instead of lip-syncing to a backing track and it worked for the actors: they are able to emote and react to the situation instead of being stuck to a ridged song. Many of the big solo numbers ('I Dreamed a Dream', 'On My Own' and 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables') were done as one long take, intensifying the emotion and we get see every facial expression and feel every emotion. Because of the live action some moments work better in film, like the line 'every word that he says is a dagger in me' was Eponine singing to herself instead of belting it out. Most of the performances were more gentle and naturalistic then it was on the stage. Some songs worked better on the stage simply because the way the flow the stage can provide when a film would need to cut.<br/><br/>At a running time of over 2 and half hours Les Mis is long, but it was actually a breeze and it is a great sign that a long film feels shorter then it really is. But the biggest criticism I have is the staging, particular during the revolution because the Barricade and the streets of Paris did look like a sound stage then a real location. I was hoping for a classic, David Lean style epic.<br/><br/>Les Mis is a very enjoyable, worthy film. The most harden person against musicals would possibly not be won over, but I personal prefer a musical be mostly sung throughout then people mostly speaking and then suddenly burst out into song."
"DubhDoo","8","0","1","16 January 2013"," ""Can you hear the people sing?"" Oh yes.
","Despite being proclaimed in every interview surrounding this film to be something brand new, singing live in a movie musical isn't; it's been done before on films such 'At Long Last Love', 'The Fantasticks' and 'Across the Universe'. However, it's worth noting that it has never been carried out on such a scale, with the film all- sung over the course of its relatively lengthy runtime. That means that there is no dialogue (only the occasional one line) and what we get instead is conversations being sung, ""My name is Jean Valjean"", sings an impressive Hugh Jackman, ""and I'm Javert!"", replies a strong Russell Crowe. This approach takes some adjusting to; it was about ten minutes before I got into the rhythm of it. Tom Hooper should be commended for making the decision to have his cast sing live, even if it's not a new phenomenon, mainly because it lends itself to the story and world of the film brilliantly. You can feel the songs erupting from the actors' chests, see their veins popping and sense the sheer effort they all put into it; yes, even Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>It is a film with a fantastic sense of physicality. When we see the prisoners pull the huge ship into the yard, you feel the ropes they hold firmly in their grasp and get a full sense of the gargantuan ship slowly lurching forward. The sound design helps with this; as the uprising occurs in the film's third act and many a musket is fired, you hear each shot at such a volume that it appears as if the characters are standing at your side. Too many movie musicals have an unfortunate stagey-feel (some purposely, e.g. Baz Luhrmann's brilliant 'Moulin Rouge') so it was deeply refreshing to see one with an unmistakable sense of space. <br/><br/>Much of this is down to Tom Hooper's great direction. He is fully aware that the stage primarily consists of mid-shots because of your distance from the stage, so he does everything you can't onstage, with the film's camera-work mainly relying on facial close- ups and sweeping wide shots. The former is particularly effectively in conveying the raw emotion brimming from the actors, while the latter works in giving the movie a wonderfully epic quality, especially in the Paris exterior scenes (the Elephant of Bastille!) and that stunning opening, where the camera glides in over the sea, climbing over the ship to reveal Hugh Jackman and his fellow convicts pulling it forward with as much force as they can muster. Hooper is aided by impressive lensing from DoP Danny Cohen and production designer Eve Stewart (both of whom collaborated with Hooper on 'The King's Speech') who offers a marvellous recreation of 19th Century France; sure it may be stylised, but it works to great effect in the context of the film.<br/><br/>Then there's the actors. I'm sure you've heard of the praise surrounding Anne Hathaway's performance as Fantine and how it will win her her first Academy Award. Frankly, I'd be shocked if it doesn't. Her twenty minutes on screen are a revelation to watch and should silence any naysayers who've dismissed her as being ""incapable of serious work"". Her heartbreaking delivery of 'I Dreamed a Dream' is the kind of showstopping moment that only comes along once in a while and that alone will win her the Oscar and probably the BAFTA; she's already won the Golden Globe (and deservedly at that). Then there's Hugh Jackman; great as always, he's no stranger to musicals, having impressed in a stage production of 'Oklahoma!' amongst others and appears very comfortable when belting out a few numbers. His performance is truly great and quite possibly his best yet, rivalling his similarly vein-popping work in Darren Aronofsky's criminally misjudged 'The Fountain'. Russell Crowe has garnered a lot of criticism for lack of vocal range, and while it's true that his voice is not up-to-the-standard of say, Jackman, (he occasionally slips into the rock stylings he used on 30 Odd Foot of Grunts and The Ordinary Fear of God ) , he makes up for it with his powerful presence and undeniable acting ability. Samantha Barks, having previously played Éponine onstage, is a joy to watch, delivering a great performance that simmers with broken-hearted emotion. Eddie Redmayne also impresses, rounding off a strong cast.<br/><br/>The movie has its faults however. The pacing occasionally dips and in a handful of moments, drags slightly. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter lighten the dour mood as the Thénardiers, yet simultaneously feel as if they've stumbled in from another film, because their OTT appearance and 'comedy' jars with the film's tone and realism. Amanda Seyfried meanwhile, is the only weak link in the cast; her blandness does little to help her character's inherent drippyness, while her vocals regularly stray into an irritating shrill that reverberates like a singing Disney bird being shaken about, contrasting with the vocals of literally everyone else, and no, not for the better. Thankfully, the superb Barks and Redmayne (just about) save the love triangle from awfulness it could have fallen victim to otherwise.<br/><br/>This is big and bold filmmaking at the hands of an excellent director who still allows the occasional experimental flourish (e.g. oddly tilted camera angles) to see the light of day, even in a film of this size. Sure, it is bombastic and straight-faced, but it's also one great big emotional experience. It's probably the best musical I've seen since the aforementioned 'Moulin Rouge'. You had me at ""a loaf of bread"", Mr. Jackman."

","It has always been known by the famous stage musical which first came out in the 80s and it is still running since. Discerning fans will know that it began life as one of Victor Hugo's most well-known novels. Regardless how one first came to know Les Miserables, it has now made it to the silver screen.<br/><br/>Especially for those who have watched the original stage musical and/or read the novel which first inspired it, there is a certain degree of expectation in terms of how it will translate to the big screen, considering there have been movie adaptations before, but without the singing. It is different this time, with the entire cast singing it 'live' as it progresses. A personal disclosure before the review: Yours truly actually first came to know about Les Miserables in its stage musical form learning to sing one of the songs from the musical 12 years ago in school, which the movie musical version certainly brought back memories. It was what happened 12 years ago where from there yours truly read the novel which formed the basis of the famous stage musical and now, the movie musical version.<br/><br/>For those who have watched the original stage musical, the movie musical directed by Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper (first known for his work in The King's Speech) along with the crew who had played a part in the success of the original musical production by the likes of Cameron Mackintosh, Alain Boubil (who co-wrote the original French lyrics), Herbert Kertzmer (who wrote the English-language version of the lyrics), Claude-Michel Schonberg, it follows the original musical's storyline in its adaptation based on Victor Hugo's novel.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated, set in post-French Revolution 19th century France, the story began in 1815 of ex-convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who has been released on parole by Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) after spending a 19-year sentence for stealing a loaf of bread for his sister's child before finding solitude in the Bishop of Digne (Colm Wilkinson) who pardoned him for stealing silver where eight years later, Valjean under the disguise of Monsieur Madeleine, has assumed on a different identity as factory owner and mayor in Montreuil-sur-Mer who is well-liked and respected by the locals. One of his factory workers Fantine (Anne Hathaway) would eventually be sacked for sending money to her illegitimate daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen as young Cosette) who works at an inn the Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) run. Fantine would become a prostitute in a desperate attempt to support Cosette, before being saved by Valjean (whom she only knows as Monsieur Mayor) after she was arrested by Javert for attacking an abusive man, who brought her to hospital. Valjean would reveal his real identity to the court after learning from Javert a man believed to be him was arrested, before arriving at the hospital to promise Fantine's dying wish of looking after Cosette. Valjean would escape from Javert again at the hospital before finding Cosette at the Thenardiers and paid them to allow him to take care of her and promising to be like a father and mother to her. It would be nine years later in 1832 where revolution was in the air after the death of the only government official sympathetic to the poor in General Jean Maximilien Lamarque with people like the student revolutionaries in Enjolras (Aaron Tveit), Marius Pontmercy (Eddie Redmayne) and street urchin Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone) discussing plans for heading to the barricades on the same day of General Lamargue's funeral. In between talk of a revolution, Marius fell in love at first sight with Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), now a young woman.<br/><br/>One cannot escape the goosebumps when it comes, and it did at various moments in the movie musical for yours truly. There were times it does coincide with the poignant scenes, like Hugh Jackman's Jean Valjean character after being pardoned by the Bishop of Digne with 'Valjean's Soliloquy' and questioning his own identity with 'Who Am I?' and the highly-publicised performance of Anne Hathaway when she sang 'I Dreamed A Dream'. Apart from those moments and the times yours truly actually nearly cried given of the level of the poignancy from different scenes, there is also the comic relief provided by the Thenardiers from especially Sascha Baron Cohen as the 'Master of the House', one of the songs he sang along with Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>With the memories of yours truly learning to sing Young Cosette's 'Castle On A Cloud' back in school in music class before learning the background story to the song and Les Miserables in general, there is a degree of expectation prior to watching the movie musical with all the more of what has been said about the movie musical in terms of how it was made. Yours truly have been disappointed by a past movie adaptation she once watched, and it has nothing to do with no singing was involved. While I am impressed by the fact that the cast of the movie musical has to sing their parts 'live' with especially Jackman and Hathaway in terms of what their roles demand of them in Jean Valjean and Fantine respectively, it is the camera angles which can be a put off, being a little too close for comfort at times.<br/><br/>Other than that, despite never seen the full stage musical version before and more of depending on what I know of Les Miserables from the novel itself and what I have read about the stage musical, it still manages to do one of Victor Hugo's well-known novels justice and making it relevant for the modern audience once again."

","Let's not talk about the singing. We know it wasn't as good as we want it. But... Set that aside, let's talk about the acting and how the whole movie came out... was it good?<br/><br/>I, as much as everyone else, had high expectations for this movie. It was so good in a lot of very specific moments... that it makes you resent the other scenes which came out very poorly.<br/><br/>Okay, it's love-hate for me. I didn't like it as much as I expected I would. It wouldn't even be my Best Picture pick. I just feel like they compromised too much and forgot to piece it all together.<br/><br/>I am a big Les Miserables fan. I just know that there are so many ways that this 2012 version could have been made better. I have seen the 25th Anniversary Concert, I have seen the 2nd movie with Uma Thurman and Liam Neeson as Fantine and Valjean. The 2nd movie wasn't a musical but it was done so good that it raised the bar for a 3rd movie. <br/><br/>And this, I have to honestly say: I feel sorry for Russel Crowe. He wasn't right for Javert's role. It's NOT his fault. He is a great actor... but he just isn't right for the role. I love Russel Crowe. But he is no Javert. Every moment the camera is on him, I see only Russel, I do not see Javert. The Javert that is cunning and inhumane... the Javert that I have come to hate... I can't see it. That it's frustrating. Javert's role is very important here and they failed to show that in this movie. He is the reason for Jean Valjean's suffering but sadly, it wasn't portrayed well. <br/><br/>Overall, I really didn't like it. It's frustrating. Because there were scenes here and there that were really captivating and moving, but there were so many other scenes that makes you feel like they weren't sure what they wanted to do.<br/><br/>You know that feeling when you are about to sneeze but you lose it at the peak of wanting to sneeze??? It felt that way for me. I can think of a much better way to explain that but it's too pornographic. But you know what I mean.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate. It could have been really great."

","I cry at movies a lot. I'm a father of six in my late 40's who has quite a sensitive side, and have been that way most of my life. (I realized growing up that Chicks dig that:). I've seen the play and seen the non-musical with Liam Neeson and Claire Danes. This movie was a masterpiece in a lot of ways, but I felt like the musical talent wasn't robust enough to meet the challenge. The actors that sang put a lot of passion into it, but it was stifled by their lack of true musical talent. To be quite frank, if they weren't big names, and sang like that, they wouldn't have gotten the parts. There were some very good scene adaptations that were different that the other productions of Les Mis that I've seen. I'm upset that it didn't move me to tears frankly."

I have nothing against musicals and some benefit from exposure to the silver screen but Les Miserables has just 2 memorable songs and just doesn't grab me, the story is weak, especially when the bad guy is played so unconvincingly. I admire the photography and set pieces to this film and hats off to whoever had the courage to make it a full blown musical, the live singing gives the soundtrack reality, especially Anne Hathaways set piece (oscar on it's way) though the acoustics especially in the opening scene were a little weak and the film, like the stage version, is way too long. All in all this is given an above average mark as it is by no means a turkey"
"iankinzel-1","5","0","4","12 January 2013"," Good Effort Ruined by Russell Crowe
","The striking cinematography gravitates towards awe-inspiring panoramic views and searingly honest close-ups; Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman are masterful as Fantine and Jean Valjean, respectively; the ensemble cast brings out compelling character traits that one won't see in other visual adaptations of Victor Hugo's novel. For all this, ""Les Miserables"" would seem to have much to recommend it.<br/><br/>However, like reputations ruined in single instances, all this effort has been wasted on account of two facts:<br/><br/>1). Russell Crowe plays Javert, an unyielding, nearly omnipresent nemesis to Jackman's Valjean; and 2)Russell Crowe can barely sing. <br/><br/>Crowe never goes past his head voice, lending his entire performance an airy, cordial, occasionally nasal quality. This Javert would be more in place as a meek hotel bellboy; he lacks the sternness, the dignity, the power of, say, Phillip Quast's stage rendition. All this might be forgivable if Crowe's performance were at least pleasant to listen to - alas, if only.<br/><br/>On occasion, Crowe has the chance to speak a line instead of singing it. It's on these occasions - ""Take one more step and you die"" - that it becomes clear why Crowe was cast for the role. He's a perfectly capable actor for the role of Javert; he's simply not a capable singer for it.<br/><br/>Given how integral the role of Javert is to this production, and given how poorly suited Crowe was for the production, I can't overlook this one (constantly) glaring flaw in giving ""Les Miserables"" more than a 5 out of 10. This is disappointing to me, as there are many remarkable performances, a lot of amazing camera work, and - above all - a beautiful play with transcendent music. Sometimes, though, it's the one big mistake that matters more than the many successful components."
"MovieNinjaGuy","5","0","2","12 January 2013"," Great but not perfection.
","Fantastic movie but not excellent for me. <br/><br/>The film did add some more story which was fabulous. <br/><br/>Loved ""The Confrontation""!! And Hathaway did superb with Fantine. Her death scene was well done and very emotional. Probably more so than Valjean's.<br/><br/>Changing the order of a few of the main songs irritated me. Hearing the echo line ""Do you hear the people sing"" in ""One Day More"" BEFORE actually hearing the full song seems wrong. Musicals have a careful structure and it seems sloppy to mess with that. In fact ""One Day more"" simply didn't feel as grandiose as I think it should, some better shots could have been added. As my wife pointed out, it should definitely have faded to black at the end of that. Perhaps even go for full 3 hrs and use an intermission?! The whole film lacked medium shots I think. It was always up close or far away. I appreciate the use of close ups to feel involved but at times it seemed an unnecessary cheap way of making the film.<br/><br/>Further slight disappointments were Master of the House. Err.. watch 25th Anniversarry version for more fun. Complete unnecessary disgusting parts added here. I always picture it more of a party with a sly pub owner and his wife. Matt Lucas and Jenny Galloway were more fun and lovable. Jackman's ""Bring Him Home"" was too forced and slightly uncomfortable to listen to. I would have re-shot this song for the film.<br/><br/>The ""Les Miserables"" title DEFINITELY should have been added at the very start of ""At the end of the day."" and a bit more oomph in the orchestra and dynamics should have been included throughout the film pretty much. How come Cameron Mackintosh signed this off after running the show for so long. There is simply a lack of attention to detail here I think, for no reason.<br/><br/>Jackman, Crowe and Hathaway were all excellent though. Didn't mind Crowe's singing, it felt good enough. Seyfried slightly wobbly but nothing too uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Great but with a few more critical film makers on board it could have been perfect I think. Will go see the film and the London show again though as I think a combination of the two is probably what makes Les Mis great now. 8/10"
"jmpa-580-83376","8","0","1","12 January 2013"," Cathartic, didactic, awesome
","My childhood encounter with an old film of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables made me resistant to the musical when it appeared on the London stage. However, having seen film clips, I wanted to go and see what the director had made of it on the big screen. This is an experience which should take you on a roller coaster of emotions- but in fact leaves the viewer in awe as the music opens out beyond what can feasibly shown in a stage performance. Les Mis is less of a stage musical and more of an opera- and given the scale of history and the amount of bloodshed and human suffering three hours isn't actually long enough to do it justice. The director's decision to have the actors sing live mean that this isn't a slick, engineered stage musical- in the same way that Evita was- but there's a fair bit of raw emotion around. The use of green screen and CGI to recreate Hugo's picture of 19thC Paris is cleverly done- especially in those scenes where Russell Crowe's character is literally walking on the edge contemplating his battle of wills with Jackman's Valjean. The filming of the revolution scenes in Greenwich was a tour de force- the scale of those buildings adds a sense of the period and the drama of the failed attempt at sedition. Marius and his colleagues light the touch paper- but instead of a full scale rebellion- they pay for the damp squib with their lives. This is where film shows the scale of the disaster. The death of the child revolutionary Gavroche- so full of zeal and spirit- a really spiky little lad- and the gesture in which Crowe's hard military officer pins his medal on the corpse was the moment in which the futility of the rebellion is brought home to the audience. As expected, the performances of the ladies in the film tugged at the heartstrings – there was nothing slick and glossy as we watched Anne Hathaway's Fantine, endure the most horrific suffering. The poor young woman- a victim that Valjean failed to save- goes through the circles of hell as she sells her hair and her teeth, and finally her virtue. It is in this moment as we see her heart break when she sings 'I dreamed a dream' that we appreciate that director Hooper's not using a recorded track was particularly poignant. Other performances save the film from becoming too much of a weepy- Helena Bonham Carter in the caricature trademark performance that she has developed (at one point I kept seeing parallels with Sweeney Todd) and Sascha Baron Cohen as her sidekick mountebank spouse. However, as we watch his journey from the galleys to redemption, the film very much belongs to Hugh Jackman. I'd packed tissues expecting to weep all the way through- but in fact only needed them at the point where his dying hero is united with Fantine- the death of a good and just man. I'm really glad I saw this movie- it does stay true to Hugo's didactic story- and the audience does experience a real sense of catharsis. One word of advice- don't wait for the DVD- this has to be seen on the big screen."

","Les Misérables is a screen adaption of a famous play of the same name. Set in France during the 19th Century, the film is the story of Prisoner 24601 or Jean Valjean played by Hugh Jackman, a man imprisoned for stealing bread, who escapes and goes on the run. After meeting a woman, Fantine, played by Anne Hathaway, she tells him she has a daughter just before she dies. He retreats the daughter, and decides to become a father figure to her. All the while being chased by Javert, played by Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper, the director, has only really directed one feature film - The King's Speech - with a relatively small budget and mostly unknown cast members (except for Helena Bonham Carter). In this second feature, he goes bigger but unfortunately not better. I quite enjoyed the first hour and a half or so of Les Miz, but when it reached a certain point in the storyline, introduced a new character, and completely changed direction. The singing became tiresome, the ending prolonged and the character's became less and less interesting. Everything went downhill. Could have done with shaving about 20 minutes maybe more.<br/><br/>But aside from the last hour or so, the first and second act were fantastic. I was really enjoying it and you could tell so were the directors and actors. Everything was unique and I've never seen a film quite like it before. The acting was still great from everyone also, and the directing continued to be great throughout. A few problems with the CGI and the sets (and Russell Crowe singing. It was good, but didn't suit him.)<br/><br/>I'd give it 8/10 for the first half, 6/10 for the second. 14/20. 7/10 in total. Enjoyable, but needed a bit of work to become better. First half is still pretty amazing though."

","The life of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is best summed up in the words of another beloved street rat, ""All this for a loaf of bread?""<br/><br/>From that single loaf, we become witness to an epic game of cat-and- mouse (between Wolverine and The Gladiator), the birth of a revolution, and a gut-wrenching performance from Anne Hathaway you won't ever forget.<br/><br/>The movie was filmed in five months, and is the first musical film adaptation to record the audio live, rather than have the actors lipsync over a pre-recorded studio track. Tom Hooper's decision to film the actors live evokes some of the most powerful scenes in recent memory, particularly from Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, both deserving of Oscar nods. His use of extreme close-ups (REALLY extreme close-ups) and long, uninterrupted takes gives a raw, gritty quality to the film that brings out the true pain and suffering of the Miserable.<br/><br/>While there is much that goes on in this sweeping tale involving the excitement of an uprising, and a short-lived love triangle not unlike the one in Victor Hugo's other masterpiece The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the story is all about redemption, and redemption comes in the form of Jean Valjean. He spent 20 years in captivity, and his only crime was being a good uncle: he stole a loaf of bread to feed his starving nephew. Those 20 years moved Jean Valjean to lose faith. The real story of Les Miserables is Jean Valjean's quest to find it again.<br/><br/>Problem is, the road to recovery is blocked by the lawman Javert (Russell Crowe), who forces Valjean to play Catch Me If You Can a la Frank Abagnale. Like the nugget that won't flush, Javert keeps coming back. He suffers from a classic case of hubris, and refuses to see Valjean as anything more than a criminal. The only thing that keeps Valjean going is Colette, I mean, Cosette (Isabelle Allen/Amanda Seyfried).<br/><br/>While Allen is absolutely adorable as young Cosette, and worth fighting for, Seyfried shines in the role of the woman Cosette has come to be, her voice so angelic you soon forget she used to predict the weather with her boobs. While Javert represents Pride, the only obstacle in Valjean's road to redemption, Cosette serves as Hope and the only guiding light. Valjean takes it upon himself to raise Cosette, after discovering he inadvertently led Cosette's mother's life to ruin.<br/><br/>Not since Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta has any female performance looked so tragic yet so beautiful as Anne Hathaway in her role as Fantine. As brief as her appearance was in the film, she killed the role and stole the show. If Anne Hathaway doesn't get an Oscar, I will shave my head.<br/><br/>How did they deliver such an ambitious film in so little time? For one they had the right crew. The composers and lyricists of the original musical were heavily involved with production. It also helps to have Tom Hooper as Quarterback. Hooper was masterful in telling a simple story about a king with a speech impediment, and is the perfect captain to helm the ship that takes us on a voyage of so many emotions. There's even ample room for humor provided by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, which was much needed in a story so miserable. They both have big names and have the effortless ability to bring big laughs. The same can be said for the entire cast. Not the big names and the big laughs part, but the effortlessness in their abilities to know their roles and to own them. Did I mention Anne Hathaway deserves an Oscar?<br/><br/>Catwoman and Wolverine in one of the most epic musicals of all time. Who'da thunk it? At least we're already used to seeing Jackman with Mutton Chops. Too bad Jean Valjean can't Berserker Barrage his way out of this tragedy. He does, however, have the power to heal himself, only it takes much, much longer. He heals himself through humility, through forgiveness, and through moving musical soliloquies that show us how powerful we can be even when we are most miserable."

I think Hugh Jackman is a great actor, but Colm Wilkinson IS Jean Valjean!<br/><br/>However, I remain to see Les Miserable as a film and I am eager to see how the movie adaptation compares to the real deal. I can only hope that Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe can pull it off. I don't expect them to be as great at singing as the West End or Broadway performers, but if they give the songs good justice, then I'll be happy with the casting. <br/><br/>I still think that Colm Wilkinson however, is playing the wrong part.

","The tale is epic, grand, and stunning. The pathos is heart-rending, the joy is exhilarating. Les Mis is the truly the pinnacle of the visual storytelling art. The story is told in a way that, as a lover of the theater version who's seen it multiple times, this was the first time I could follow the story without having to wrack my brain to keep characters straight. HOWEVER, this version misses the mark in some serious ways. As many other commenters have mentioned, the extreme close-ups, while helpful for keeping track of characters, are distracting and take away from the grand scope, and several of the acting choices detracted from the musicality - should've stuck with actual singers. **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** The big downer for us was some choices the directors made to show details that were unnecessary. Fontaine's time as a prostitute, in every other production I've seen, is hinted at. This is far more intimate, and revolting, to the point of almost walking out of the movie. Showing the ""dentist"" moving in to remove her teeth (for cash) did not add anything to her desperation than the usual hair cutting/prostitution. Javair's suicide - we get it, you don't need to show the body breaking on the waterfall and hear the crack of his bones breaking. The innkeepers were not just bawdy and funny, they were nauseating and far past over the top. Showing Santa/Bishop ""getting some"" was, again, just unnecessary, and detracted from our enjoyment of the show. In each of these scenes, you could hear the audience cringing. The tale is too grand, the message too worthy, the music too powerful to damage it with Hollywood's idea of ""gritty"" or cheap sensationalism. **** SPOILERS BEHIND **** Again, when it kept the grand scale, when it tells the story, Les Mis is a beautiful, wrenching tale. We loved it. When it tries for Hollywood style ""intimate details"" to make it more realistic or whatever, it fails."

","""Les Mis was great except for the part where the people were singing. So... at least 5-10 minutes in there. This film just reminded me what I don't like about musicals generally: thin story, weak character development, heavy reliance on suspension of disbelief, and melodramatic plot points.<br/><br/>Conveniently, at least two characters just decide to die when the story needs them to without giving any explanation as to why (Fantine and Valjean were were quite healthy in the scenes just previous to their death). And yet wading through sewers of human excrement with open wounds and no modern medicine doesn't seem to phase these characters. Javert has a pathological obsession with prosecuting some guy who stole a loaf of bread 30 years earlier and only did 20 years time for it... even as all sorts of heinous crimes are taking place around him, yet no insight is given into his character - does he have friends, family, goals, ambitions? And though Jean Valjean laments about what will happen to his factory when he turns himself in, the film never shows the factory again and no mention is ever made as to what happened to the seamstresses who work there. The female leads seem incapable of doing anything for themselves even as the male leads can reinvent and recast themselves many times throughout the film.<br/><br/>Worse, Cossette is given no character goal other than to be transferred from the care of her foster dad to a random guy she met two days earlier. Where's Nora Helmer and her Dollhouse when we need her? What a shoddy excuse for a film. But nobody seems to expect much in terms of plot because the weak story is drawn out into 157 minutes of singing about obvious emotional conflicts and plot points.<br/><br/>Clearly I don't appreciate musicals... particularly on film. ""Django Unchained"" was playing just across the hall and during many of the intolerable singing story slumps I imagined dancing out of the theater and into the next."

","After two decades of waiting, the long-awaited movie version of the hit musical Les Miserables has finally arrived and it was worth the hype and worth the wait. This film has come at a time when the nation is still recovering from the Newtown tragedies and Hurricane Sandy. One of the film's songs, Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, and the rousing finale, gives a dramatic sense that we must keep our heads up and move on with our lives and the world all around us.<br/><br/>Spanning around two decades of a French Revolution-like era in the 19th century, the film begins in 1815 with Jean Vaijean {Hugh Jackman} being free on parole after 19 years being jailed for stealing a piece of bread for his family. He tries to fit in, but finding no work because of his parole papers, he decides to steal some sliver from a bishop. The police stop him, but the bishop decides to give Vaijean two candlesticks. For Vaijean, it becomes a change of conscience, and with that, he rips his parole paper to shreds. Soon, Jean tries to run away from the law and hide, while police officer Javert {Russell Crowe} is straight on his trail for the next 16 years. Along the way, Vaijean gains a daughter, Cosette {Isabelle Allen in early years, Amanda Seyfried in adult form} from factory worker-turned prostitute Fantine {Anne Hathaway}, has run-ins with the loony Thenardier innkeepers {Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter}, and helping to fight in the Revolution with her daughter's lover Marius {Eddie Redmayne} while trying to escape.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper of King's Speech fame has crafted a heartbreaking, powerful and brilliantly made musical epic this side of West Side Story. The script has the same plot and wall-to-wall singing as the musical, but some of the songs are changed in the movie {for instance, I Dreamed a Dream takes place right after Fantine becomes a whore}. With the film, Hooper has broke ground with having the cast sing their songs live on camera instead of going to a recording studio recording them. This new technique works so flawlessly that you forget who the real actors are singing the song. Like in The King's Speech, Hooper also succeeds in making his cast of characters as real as they are really seem to be. Plus, with giving the film a fast-paced style, hand-held camera-like images and filming one-shots on Dream and On My Own, Hooper may become the British's answer to Scorsese.<br/><br/>Jackman is wonderful as Vaijean, while Crowe's rock star-like voice adds a bit more authority to his Javert. Newcomer Samantha Barks is magnificent as the Thenardiers' daughter, and her rendition of On My Own is pure musical awesomeness. Cohen and Carter are both madcap funny as the Thenardiers, and Seyfried and Redmayne make a enchanted couple as Cosette and Marius. But the biggest standout in the film is Hathaway, bar none. Her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream is in a word, unforgettable. Here's hoping Anne has a spot at home saved for Mr. Oscar.<br/><br/>While Alain Boubill and Claude-Michel Schonberg's opera-like score is hummable in some spots, it has the texture and sound of classic British poetry. Their Master of the House is still one jolly showstopper, while the film's only new song, the sweet Suddenly could be a Oscar lock for best song.<br/><br/>We're now finally proud to have Les Miz sung on the big screen, and it couldn't come at a better time like this.<br/><br/>P.S. Bring two or three packs of Kleenex. You're really gonna need them just in case.<br/><br/>Rating: **** Rated PG-13 for suggestive and sexual material, violence and thematic elements {For ages 14 and up}"

Not exactly because of the music since I think that its music or the lyrics are not very rich or brilliant and singers not particularly good at it. But the development and presentation of the story are great indeed as well as the performing of the cast and the depth and strength of the dramatic scenes from beginning till the end. As most of us know by having read the novel in our youth, this is the moving story of an ex-convict released on parole and being hunted by inspector Javert during all the rest of his life for having broken parole rules by evading vigilance and building himself a new honest life who brought him to the post of mayor in a town. Javert was the symbol of those law agents who care more of the strict law abiding than of human justice. The other main characters are the young girl Cosette that our ex-con takes care of during his permanent trial to escape Javert's searching for his whereabouts to have him jailed again and her young revolutionary lover. The action in the movie gains more and more dramatic intensity till its epic end when the plot mixes itself with the events of the aborted revolution of 1832 in Paris. The street fighting and the barricades scenes are violent in terms of action and very well filmed.<br/><br/>To love this,movie you must forget its musical weaknesses in my opinion and stick to the story drama."

","Tom Hooper's 2012 film adaptation of Les Misérables has introduced movie goers to the French revolution through an entirely new lens, and has been described by some as ""you want to stand up and wave your flag fabulous."" It's left some enthusiasts in awe of the story and its characters anew, while others walk away with mixed feelings.<br/><br/>A love affair with Les Misérables rooted firmly in the music leaves little room for viewers to appreciate the film, which follows a set of priorities distinctly different from that of the musical. Arguably, much of the enchantment and delight of the stage production lies in Claude-Michel Schönberg's musical score. While filmmakers have largely maintained the familiar melodies and lyrics for all you die-hard Les Mis fans, the singing too often disappoints.<br/><br/>Schönberg's Stars is the quiet before the storm. Terrifyingly beautiful, it is the promise of death itself veiled in perfect serenity and a sense of justice. Yet Russell Crowe's rendition is merely passable. Just as the song rises and swells, Crowe holds his voice back to a strained nasal tone, leaving the music flat and expressionless. Not even a quavering shadow to Philip Quast singing Javert.<br/><br/>Moving on to Hugh Jackman, the film's Jean Valjean. I noticed myself exhaling a palpable sigh of relief each time the camera panned away from him in the opening scenes. Jackman's singing is forced, overdone, and dramatic to a fault. Case in point: the beauty of the song Bring Him Home lies in its quiet simplicity, which incessant and melodramatic vibrato does not convey.<br/><br/>While we can't help longing for the voice of our beloved Lea Salonga, if we've entered the theater with an open mind it is surprisingly easy to accept Samantha Barks as a lovely Éponine, and Anne Hathaway portrays a remarkable Fantine. Though in my opinion it is Isabelle Allen playing little Cosette who is the best singer of the lot.<br/><br/>Where the singing falls flat, the film turns to talented actors and tricks of the big screen to rope us along. The film begins with a strong, successful reworking of the original musical's opening scene, featuring the common man of the French revolution. The stormy shipyard and enormous ship looming over a huge ensemble cast singing in booming tones takes advantage of the capabilities of the big screen while preserving the integrity of the original story.<br/><br/>In any musical production, there is a fine line to walk between song and speech. The brief singing sections as artificial transitions that string together the original songs of the Les Misérables soundtrackYes, they are rather cheesy. Yes, they can be rather awful. But this is musical theater we are talking about. Better contrived singing clips to provide transitions than awkward dialogue gaps breaking continuity.<br/><br/>While the most significant of these musical clips Suddenly may initially appear to be a daring deviation from the original score, this new piece is composed by none other than Claude-Michel Schönberg himself. We must give credit to the film where credit is due. As we must acknowledge the indisputable significance of Colm Wilkinson, our original Jean Valjean, playing the part of the bishop.<br/><br/>And on that note (pun not intended) something significant, something huge, went right with this film. Live takes allowing the actors free reign of their music and self expression has surely set a precedent for musical films of the future.<br/><br/>Capable acting repeatedly saves the show when singing has failed to impress. Any lack of raw singing talent Anne Hathaway betrays is easily disregarded as her conviction and commitment to her character brings Fantine alive anew. Genuine, distinctive, and moving, Hathaway pulls herself away from direct comparison and truly makes the role of Fantine her own.<br/><br/>In the same vein, perhaps the film's most redeeming quality is the genius casting of Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as the leeringly lascivious, maliciously mischievous Thénardiers. Carter and Cohen craft a brilliant world of the blithely upbeat yet terrifyingly unsettling realm lurking just below the surface of bourgeoisie Paris.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne as Marius, on the other hand, is not likable in the slightest. Granted, one valid interpretation of the story would depict Marius the romantic, the weak one, the lone survivor of the revolution. Yet in this film he is rendered undeservingly pathetic, his expression pleading, his voice consistently taking on a girlish tone.<br/><br/>But perhaps we ought not care that Marius is unlikeable, as he plays only a minor role. Likewise, the stories of the students and of Cosette and Éponine are brief and largely overlooked. From the building of the barricade through Little Fall of Rain and Gavroche's death, the songs are smashed together in a tacky, transparent time crunch. The film unabashedly shunts Cosette, Éponine and Marius off into mere side stories.<br/><br/>Initially, I was affronted by the rushing of Éponine's story, which has always been particularly close to my heart. But the emphasis on Marius' rescue at the hands of Valjean and on the father daughter relationship between Valjean and Cosette, so severely overlooked all these years by theatrical renditions of Les Mis, indicates a larger overarching goal: to better focus the movie on the life of Jean Valjean himself.<br/><br/>What Tom Hooper has done with the story is nothing short of brilliant. He has made Victor Hugo's entire enormous volume and Claude-Michel Schönberg's lengthy musical accessible to the whole of our movie going, entertainment seeking modern day society. He has maintained the integrity of the story while streamlining it to center around one man. Taken alone, it is possible to appreciate this masterpiece for what it is.<br/><br/>The illusion is broken when we remember that the music of Les Misérables is itself the magic of the storytelling, and that this movie soundtrack cannot hold a candle to the singing prowess of Colm Wilkinson, Patti Lupone, Ruthie Hensall, and the voices of the Les Mis stage."

","Les Mis is one of the world's best movies of all time for music. It is a feel good and relaxing film. If you like singing than Les Mis is the movie that you need to go see on the big screen before it sales out. It is a movie that is a old time movie kind of like Rock of Ages or Hairspray but much much better and more modern. I would love to see this wonderful movie again it is a work of art i love it so much. I never wanted it to end that is how good this movie was it was magical wonderful brilliant and so so so much more. If you are going to take your kids there is some bad language in this movie and some smoking in it as well but besides all of that your kids will love this wonderful movie. I think this was one of the most magical movies of 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 and 2007. i just loved it I hope this review was helpful for you."

The director did an amazing job shooting this. I wouldn't say I found it sad to a point of crying, but I definitely felt something inside watching this. I was amazed, upset, excited, and felt hope at the same time. I never found myself getting lost into films as much as I did watching this. <br/><br/>By all means, I don't watch musicals.

"ClaytonDavis","9","0","2","5 January 2013"," Les Miserables is Broadway Magic on the Silver Screen!
","In what seems like an eternity, Tom Hooper's long-awaited Les Miserables starring Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, and Anne Hathaway has finally been screened and finished. Director Hooper came out to introduce his film at the Alice Tully Theater at Lincoln Center on Friday, November 23, 2012 and explained that he had just finished the picture at 2 a.m. the evening before. The wait was well worth it. Les Miserables is not only stunningly powerful, and beautifully crafted, it's the best stage musical adaptation since Rob Marshall's Chicago (2002). Incredibly moving and featuring some of the most powerful musical numbers ever constructed, Tom Hooper tops his previous film The King's Speech (2010) with artistry and passion.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a paroled prisoner in the 1800s that over the course of decades, attempts to find redemption while a police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) pursues him relentlessly.<br/><br/>What astonishes me is how emotionally invested I became with the characters. I've never witnessed the stage musical on Broadway so this is my first outing with the musical. Hooper brings focus to each player and ensures they are an integral part of the story and film. Jean Valjean is our hero, placed firmly front and center, attached to the screen and centered cinematically in the medium for all the audience to invest. Jackman has never been better, delivering his most devoted and tender turn of his career. His opening number ""What Have I Done?"" and near closing ""Bring Him Home"" are his shining moments showcasing a vocal master class and a sensational acting piece that will put to rest any doubts about how talented he really is. It's unfortunate that despite his career-topping work, the Best Actor race is incredibly competitive and even more stacked. It's not a sure-thing for him to be named among the nominees but a strong campaign with a constant reminder of his preparation for the role, losing 30 pounds, vocal training, etc. could push him over.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe in the role of Javert was the only principal actor not to be featured (prominently) in the full-length trailer and featurette, placing speculation in his abilities to sing for the role. Unfortunately, standing next to the likes of Jackman, Eddie Redmayne, and other cast members, his vocals are merely satisfactory. There are many who may find his work here grating and ill-fitting. Physically, Crowe fits the role quite well. He's always been an outstanding actor, proving time after time that he can deliver in the right roles, singing roles notwithstanding. His final number ""Soliloquy"" shows his limitations considerably but Crowe cannot be completely faulted. He makes do with what he has and is satisfactory.<br/><br/>In the role of Fantine, Anne Hathaway sings and seals her Oscar speech with ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Despite her role being incredibly brief, she makes an undeniable impression and has solidified herself in the Best Supporting actress category. Hathaway lost nearly 15-pounds for the role, cut her hair off, and vocally prepared for weeks. Hathaway doesn't just act like Fantine; she becomes her, with blood, sweat, and tears and talent, voice, and art. It's her best turn since Rachel Getting Married (2008).<br/><br/>As Epinone, Samantha Barks is one of the year's found treasures. Devastatingly heartrending in her number ""On my Own,"" Barks shows she was born for the role. Is Barks Oscar-worthy? You bet she is. As Cosette, Amanda Seyfried puts her best practices to use as she sings delightfully and remains a warming presence. Don't get me started on Young Cosette played by Isabelle Allen who is cute as a button and full of acting abilities. In our rare instances of comedy, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter stand out among a great ensemble. ""Master of the House"" is a hilarious scene that has the two performers doing what they do best.<br/><br/>When you feel like you're down by a few runs, a coach always sends in his pinch hitter to shut the other team down. In this case, Tom Hooper got a whiff of other viable contenders like Steven Spielberg's Lincoln and Ben Affleck's Argo closing in on the Oscar game, Hooper went into his arsenal and sent in the stand out and very talented Eddie Redmayne to rid any doubts that Les Miserables is not the year's most innovative picture. More importanly, Redmayne has put himself in a prime position to be one of cinema's most gifted thespians in years to come. As Marius, Redmayne embodies him, heart and soul, and allows it to pour from the screen and into the aisles tear by tear. Incredibly moving, Redmayne during ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,"" will make you believe in the power of Les Mis and even more, the power of the movies. Eve Stewart's Production Design is stellar and stands brightly next to other period contenders this year. Danny Cohen's Cinematography feels more appropriate and even more ambitious than his last outing with Hooper. It's a nomination that Cohen can easily capture. Paco Delgado's costumes are gorgeous and with his choices for Cosette and Marius' wardrobes, he'll stand out next to any contender this year at the Academy Awards. Chris Dickens' editing is fluid and in many ways is the reason the film succeeds so well.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper's direction is what shines as he delivers zeal and intensity in his approach to bring every single actor and craftsman to their fullest potential. He's the conductor, composing in ways, his most personal work. He deeply cares about the story, music, and production. There are instances as the film engulfs you into the screen, where Les Miserables feels larger than life. A cautionary tale about revenge and redemption that could be the great musical structures this side of the world. Hooper respects the medium, appreciates and understands the narrative, and nurtures his performers like the father of cinema....Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"
"samkowaluk","10","0","2","4 January 2013"," We wanted a perfect adaptation. We pretty much got it.
","As a Les Mis fan, I was damn excited for this one (Even more excited then I was for Dark Knight Rises), and after seeing it, i think we've gotten the perfect adaptation we wanted.<br/><br/>If you don't know the story, dude, plot synopsis. Top of the page. So, let's get right into the film. As I said before, Les Miserables is one hell of a masterpiece in my opinion. I think some fans might be disappointed by it, considering it doesn't have the polished singing and the trained singers they're used to, but I think that would have taken away from the film had they done that. I think Tom Hooper made a great decision to have live singing, because in that, we get the true emotion that these songs are supposed to convey.<br/><br/>Performance, it's mostly phenomenal. Hugh Jackman is PERFECT as Valjean, his singing, his acting, it's all amazing. Eddie Redmayne is amazing as Marius, his rendition of Empty Chairs at Empty Tables is truly flawless. Anne Hathaway, yes everyone says she's winning the Oscar, she is, let's move on. Samantha Barks is incredible as Eponine, it was really good seeing her play the part again, and she's got a bright future ahead of her on the screen. Aaron Tveit and Daniel Huttlestone do strong work as Enjolras and Gavroche and Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bohnam Carter near steal the whole film as the Thenardiers.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about Russell Crowe. Now that I've seen the film twice, i can safely say that he is.....OK. Not amazing, not horrible, just OK. He tends to get a bit nasally at times, especially during Javert's Intervention and Javert's Suicide is kinda lackluster in terms of his acting. Amanda Seyfried, I don't hate her, I don't even think that she's a bad singer or actress, it's just that her vibratto is just horrible and obnoxious. She sounds like a goat for God's sake. <br/><br/>Some of the cuts they made are understandable, but missed (especially the cuts to Master of the House and Javert's Suicide and the entire cutting of Dog Eat Dog) Here's hoping for a Director Cut on the Blu-Ray<br/><br/>Everything else, the score, the sets, the costumes, the makeup (MY GOD THE MAKEUP) are astounding. Some of the shaky cam can get annoying at times, but I can live with that. The shaky cam, Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried aren't as good as the other parts, but it definitely won't ruin the film for you. Expect multiple Oscar nominations I think"
"lisaakeenan","9","0","2","2 January 2013"," This movie had a lot to live up to.
","Theater acting is a whole different ballgame than movie acting, with their main differences revolving around viewership. Theater actors are required to sing not just because melodies are nice, but also as a way to make sure everyone in the audience can hear the words. Their acting and costumes border on the ridiculous for the same reason.<br/><br/>Movie actors however fall on the other side of the spectrum: due to the fact that everyone will be able to see and hear what's going on, it becomes all about nuance. The subtle interplay of emotion and fine details predominate.<br/><br/>And therein lies the advantage of this film. On Broadway, the heartrending song 'I Dreamed a Dream' mostly relies on beautiful singing and lyrics to transmit emotion; in the movie, Fontaine's anguish is written all over her face. Even though Anne Hathaway can't sing like a Broadway actress, her movie acting skills more than make up for it. I actually found myself somewhat unimpressed by Samantha Bark's portrayal of Eponine, because even though she was by far the best singer, her facial expressions were at times overly dramatic for me. Russell Crowe had quite a challenge playing Javert, seeing as the character calls for a lack of emotions, and his singing voice every one in a while. Hugh Jackman was also amazing, giving what I felt to be the most well-rounded performance of the bunch. His singing and acting skills were both phenomenal.<br/><br/>In conclusion, even though I love the Broadway version of Le Mis, I felt more emotion from the film. I was always moved when I watched the play, but I bawled like a baby at the end of the movie. Despite the minor difficulties in transitioning to different medias, I still highly recommend this movie."

","I have been a huge Les Mis fan forever. I have the Complete Symphonic sound track on my phone and finally got to watch it live in September. Then I heard of this move and was thrilled. I was not impressed. The singing was alright. There were a few great parts but a few painful parts. There were also some changes made to Eponine's part that I did not like. She was great, as expected, but they limited her role some. Russell Crowe was not good at all. Even when he commits suicide he was not able to put the correct emotion into the song. Also they need to get rid of the camera man. He could not hold the camera still. They were not even moving the camera in a manner that matched what was going on at the time. It was annoying at best and I found myself closing my eyes and just listing to the movie because of it a few times. If given the option between watching the movie and just listening to the Broadway actors on the soundtrack, I would chose the soundtrack. I will say the final seen is the best singing in the entire movie and it is seeing if only for that one part."

","Les Miserables is a common mans movie that can only be appreciated by those with a mediocre understanding of history or a love for musicals; the Ann Hathaway scene in the beginning was poorly done; for a tragedy it failed to stir me once- the cinematography sacrificed original plot sequences in order to appeal to a larger audience- why the most tragic part of this movie is the ruination of a masterpiece; but perhaps I couldn't enjoy it because I was worried that a lunatic would enter the theater and open fire on the crowd.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie already I highly recommend it, but only so you can criticize it."
"classicsoncall","10","0","4","31 December 2012"," ""Remember this my brother, there is a higher plan.""
","Well if you're interested in reading a review from someone uninitiated in the story of ""Les Miserables"" you can carry on from here. I'm not a fan of movie musicals but I had the instinct to tell me that this would be something special. I wasn't wrong, and I rate the film a positive 'ten' for everything it's got going for it, but at the same time I can't say that I really liked or enjoyed it. See, I think there's a dichotomy to the movie going experience that allows one to step out of their comfort zone at times to take in something they wouldn't ordinarily care for. I read another reviewer on this board for the film who stated the nearly three hour run time felt like only ten minutes. For me, this felt like every bit of three hours and then some. I'm not trying to be flippant here, in fact I recognize the exceptional performances turned in by Jackman, Crowe and particularly Anne Hathaway. I can actually say that ""I Dreamed a Dream"" blew me away, so it's not that I can't appreciate an exceptional performance. But otherwise, I really had no interest in the story the way it was presented. I don't doubt that the film will garner it's share of honors at the Oscars. In fact, this might be the lone serious contender against ""Lincoln"" for best picture, although I haven't seen all the other nominees. Fans of the stage play will almost certainly find favor with this picture, and if you're into it, you won't be disappointed I'm sure. I'm not upset that I made the effort to see it, it's just not my thing, so it's probably best I leave it at that."
"ferguson-6","7","0","1","30 December 2012"," Master of the House
","Greetings again from the darkness. One of the most anticipated films of the year is the first from director Tom Hooper since his Oscar winning ""The King's Speech"". It also happens to be based on one of the true literary classics by Victor Hugo (first published 1862). Oh yes, it is presented as a true musical ... the dialogue is sung and story advanced through forty-something songs. The latter feature gives it more of an opera feel than the stage version I saw more than 20 years ago.<br/><br/>The biggest question and curiosity going in was whether the cast of top notch movie stars could hold their own vocally. Sure, Hugh Jackman (Jean Valjean) is a Tony winner, Anne Hathaway (Fatine) has some Broadway chops of her own, Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) sang in ""Mamma Mia"", and Russell Crowe (Javert) has toured with his own band. But this is a whole new challenge, as director Hooper decided to have the actors sing ""live"" during filming, providing a more intimate feel to the film. Throw in two exceptionally strong vocal performances from Eddie Redmayne (Marius) and Samantha Barks (Eponine) and only the harshest critics will claim the singing disappoints.<br/><br/>""Seinfeld"" fans will enjoy the comic relief from thieving innkeepers Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as they take advantage of their customers while belting out ""Master of the House"". It's pure joy to hear Colin Wilkinson's voice as The Bishop who offers Valjean his chance for redemption. Mr. Wilkinson is legendary as the original Valjean in the London and New York stage versions from the mid-80's.<br/><br/>There were a few things that distracted me at times. The most annoying being the incessant facial close-up on every song. This is typically a device to cover-up weak set design, but here the sets are spectacular and really capture the nastiness of 19th century France. And while I certainly enjoyed Ms. Hathaways' show-stopping ""I Dreamed a Dream"", I found her overall acting to be quite distracting during her few scenes. Russell Crowe's physical presence perfectly captures the omnipresent Javert, though the lack of punch in his vocals prevented the boom needed in a couple of songs. Lastly, Mr. Jackman seemed to strain on the high notes in my favorite ""Bring him Home"", though again, none of these things ruined the experience for me.<br/><br/>As with most film musicals, the best approach is just to allow the story and songs to wash over you ... don't dwell on the minor issues. Keep in mind that this is a powerful and interesting production thanks to Victor Hugo's source material. It's a privilege to enjoy a first rate presentation seen through new eyes and heard through new vocalists."

","Overall, it was very well done. Several aspects of the film disappointed me (Russell Crowes' singing, some songs shortened and eliminated, minor story changes, too much spoken dialog). However, the good outweighed the bad (Russell Crowes' acting, Anne Hathaway's outstanding performance as Fantine, close-ups of the generally great acting and generally acceptable singing, additional songs and lyrics).<br/><br/>""Lovely Ladies"" was a little more graphic than the stage show, but in a sad way, not a gratuitous way. The same is true of the battle sequences and Javert's suicide.<br/><br/>My kids both gave it two thumbs way up and were not as disappointed as I was through some of it. My son said he knew Russell Crowe's singing was weak, but he could actually feel me tense up as he butchered ""Stars"" and the suicide song. I wanted to push him into the river. Overall, it was an adequate film version of an outstanding stage show based on a classic book."

"kelli-crispin","8","0","2","28 December 2012"," Great singing - except Javert
","First off, let me say that I LOVED this movie and would definitely pay a second movie admission to see it a second time. <br/><br/>I would also preface my review with saying that I already know Les Mis, have listened to it, seen it onstage and already love the music. <br/><br/>This movie isn't for a novice. I've read quite a few reviews from people who hated the experience. If you aren't prepared for 2.5 hours of singing, it could definitely catch you by surprise! I always like a musical better once I've listened to the cd's a few times and know the songs. <br/><br/>A few really great things about the movie: 1. Anne Hathaway was absolutely AMAZING. Never knew she could sing like that, and her portrayal of Fantine blew me away! She seemed so authentic, and had me in tears practically from the time Fantine was introduced. 2. Hugh Jackman was also great! Again, never knew he could sing, so I was completely amazed. 3. The opening scene with the boat was really cool. I'm not a movie buff, and I won't claim to know anything about cinematography, but as a layperson, all I can tell you is that I thought it was powerful. <br/><br/>A few downsides: 1. Russell Crowe as Javert - Russell Crowe's looks did the job, but his singing lacked the emphasis and punctuation that I associate with Javert. Basically....the character seemed ""softer"" than I would have liked. All of Javert's singing was done in an exact tempo with no variations that would make it unique and add depth. Not a fan. 2. Too many close-ups. I like to see a close up when someone is really having an emotional moment, but I felt like this film spent a little too much time on the characters faces. For example, I LOVED Marius's voice. However, all the closeups at one point had me examining his stubble in too much detail, as well as the trembling of his jaw while singing. It was just a little too much of a good thing. <br/><br/>Also, the Thenardiers were great comic relief throughout the movie, and their casting was great! I wish that Sasha Baron Cohen could have broken out another accent (he sounded just like his Italian barber character from Sweeney Todd), but all-in all the Thenardier's were hilarious. <br/><br/>So....the 2 items above aside, I absolutely loved the movie, and will definitely be seeing it again. I'll remember my tissues this time, however!!!"
"pswilson1","6","0","5","28 December 2012"," great filming, poor casting of stars
","I think people who LOVE this film are more likely to be those who have not experienced these songs on Broadway or listened to the tracks performed by the Broadway singers.<br/><br/>While the movie WAS well done, bringing Hollywood actors to these roles was like bringing a knife to a gun-fight. Sorry, but you cannot ACT your way through a great song (Anne Hathaway). People who had previously heard these wonderful songs, written to soar, performed by singers up to the challenge, will, in this film find them brought back to earth.<br/><br/>Yes, some of the actors did better than others. Hugh Jackman, nearly passable, Anne Hathaway, a disappointment. Ha, Russell Crowe, an embarrassment. A couple of the younger actors did fairly well, but lacked power (Eponine).<br/><br/>I am not saying that the film stunk. But the director was misguided, as have directors been in the past, to think of pulling off a musical, especially a great one, with the wrong type of talent. Lea Solonga will not be losing any sleep after this one."
"Troy_Campbell","6","0","1","28 December 2012"," Accessible to non-musical fans too.
","Those close to me know that the musical genre is the one I find hardest to enjoy. When the entire movie is sung, instead of featuring dialogue and musical numbers segueing into one another, this only makes it all the more difficult. Kudos, then, to The King's Speech director Tom Hooper for making his cinematic version of 'Les Miserables' accessible (if not always entertaining) to everyone, not just genre aficionados. At two and a half hours long there are moments of insufferable dullness, yet there are also patches of breathtaking beauty and show- stopping splendour; not least due to Hooper's use of computer trickery to create sweeping, one- take shots otherwise unachievable. The cast hit the right notes too: Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway are seemingly at ease as Jean Valjean and Fantine, Russell Crowe is a gruff and compelling Javert, Eddie Redmayne is powerful as Marius and Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen are a hoot as swindling thieves Madame and Master Thenardier. Way too lengthy and occasionally pretentious, 'Les Mis' isn't always a blast, although it makes up for it with passionate performances and stunning visual design."
"MrSosotris","6","0","1","27 December 2012"," And Excellent Film, but a Disappointing Adaptation of the Musical
","Movie musicals are tricky things. For a long while, they were just frothy confections to distract people from the unsettling goings on around them (the Depression, WWII, etc.). They were never really taken seriously as a legitimate art form for a long time. But after a while, some truly quality movie musicals came out of Hollywood, and things changed.<br/><br/>In recent years, musicals have come in two varieties. There are the light-as-air escapist musicals that people watch because they're fun, don't require much thought, and are great fun to sing along with (Moulin Rouge comes to mind; though it's completely predictable and dripping with melodrama, it's so darn entertaining, you can't help but like it). Then, there are the movie musicals that have a bit more substance, like Chicago, which is stylish, sophisticated, and beautifully executed). <br/><br/>On stage, Les Mis is a flamboyant, stirring, explosion of emotion that blows audiences away from the thundering opening notes to the final chords belted out by the whole company. But, beneath that, it is also an excellent story, taken from Victor Hugo's mammoth novel of the same name. The characters are numerous, but relatable, and one finds themselves genuinely challenged by what, on the surface, seems to be a bombastic melodrama.<br/><br/>This particular version of the musical digs into the emotional journeys of the characters, not seeking to sugar coat anything. In fact, it's so emotionally raw that, at many times, it's actually uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>I have nothing against Hooper's decision to have the actors sing live, but when the actors are digging into raw nerves in order to choke out their songs through heaving sobs and strained, broken voices, the results are incredibly unpleasant. Most of the main songs aren't so bad. ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,"" and ""On My Own"" are incredibly done, as are the anthemic ""Red and Black"" and ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" (two songs which couldn't be boring if they tried). Things get shaky, however, when the actors force themselves too hard and lose control of the music. in many cases, it would have been better if they had just spoken the lines instead of whisper/croaking them out. It wouldn't have been true to the musical, but it would have been a better alternative. In many cases it seemed like the actors were frustrated with the fact that they had to half sing their lines because it seemed to be interfering with their performances. It was raw and genuine, yes, but it was not pleasant to listen to. <br/><br/>Visually the film looked great. I'm not sure if anything different was done with the cameras, but the picture was absolutely crystal clear, almost as if it was filmed at a higher film speed (like the Hobbit). I could have done with more wider camera angles here and there, though. Sure it was intimate and personal, but it also made the film seem cheaper, as if it had a small set budget and didn't really have much to show the audience, which made it seem very studio-bound. It never really felt like Paris; it felt like a soundstage.<br/><br/>In the end, I clapped along with the rest of the audience and had the songs stuck in my head all the way home, so it wasn't a terrible film. It was entertaining and featured great performances, but it just didn't work for me. It took itself too seriously and showed a lack of faith in the power of the music itself.<br/><br/>It was as if Hooper said, ""How will people know it's a sad song? They'll never figure it out on their own. Let's add rain and darkness and a giant neon sign that says REMEMBER THAT YOU SHOULD FEEL SADNESS NOW so they'll understand the emotion of the scene."""

","I was basically dragged to this movie. I heard it was depressing and I had no interest. I reluctantly went, and my mind was blown. Everything from the plot to the music to the actors was absolutely incredible. There were moments that ripped my heart out, others that made me laugh, and many that made me want to ""breakfast club"" fist pump (I can't believe I admitted to that!). Hugh Jackman was fantastic. Anne Hathaway, although she is in it for a very short time, is incredible especially in her performance of ""I dreamed a dream."" I wish we could have learned more about her. Every musical performance was jaw-dropping, made even more impressive because the actors sang live. ""Do you hear the people sing"" was my favorite. it was impeccable (that was one of those ""fist pump"" scenes). All the actors were fabulous in the musical performances, with the possible exclusion of Russell Crowe, who was at times difficult to listen to. Even though Russell Crowe is not much of a singer, the entire ensemble brought something to the film. The actors made me care about the characters like I was living in France during the revolution. This is an absolute must see!"

","For such an epic as Les Mis (and as a longtime fan of the Hugo book & the stage versions), I feel I over scrutinized the movie a bit, especially after the tragic Liam Neeson version.<br/><br/>Going in, I was not a fan of Hugh Jackman or Anne Hathaway but MAN were they both amazing - ESPECIALLY Jackman. Unbelievable! To hear all of the live emotions and imperfections when the songs are performed instead of reduced to rumble edited versions is beyond words. It is something that should be done ANY time an actor sings in a movie.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne was my next favorite character - completely believable as a young revolutionist in love and oh, that voice! Samantha Barks nailed her part.. I really could gush on for hours... Coen and Carter = Perfect innkeepers... Wow. I seriously could see the movie again tomorrow and be just as floored.<br/><br/>The only downers in the entire movie were deadpan Russell Crowe as Javert. You'll notice every note he had to hold faded into very loud music. For most of the movie his face had no affect. Javert, to me, is forceful and boisterous like a villain should be. Crowe was... meh. I felt like i was watching a young boy give a painful recital performance every time Crowe had to sing.<br/><br/>Every time Amanda Seyfried opened her mouth, her fast, shrill vibrato made me look for Snow White. A fixed deer-caught-in-headlights look is not good for a movie such as this. Aside those two, the movie was amazing.<br/><br/>OH and Marius' ""brothers"" in revolution also brought on tears with, ""Can You Hear the People Sing?"" And and and the new song fits well into the movie; it's not too long or too out of place :) Seriously. This version of Les Mis is epic."

","I can't think of any better movie, nor is there anything in IMDb Top250. This seemed better than Casablanca, Dr Zhivago, Third Man, Citizen Kane, and the 1939 movies. In ways, the plot here is similar to Shawshank Redemption, but this redemption is more intense, involves more people, and more interrelationships.<br/><br/>The movie was very true to the play, but added some important subtleties from the book. Even so, the whole feel was much larger than the play - more lifelike. The acting and cinematography was really excellent. The imperfect live singing made everything more real. There were a few added minor songs which were OK. Fantines downfall was heartbreaking. In the very end of the play, Fantine and Eponine were involved; in the movie, Fantine and the bishop; a nice change.<br/><br/>The amount of action at the barricades was distracting. No, there was no intermission after One More Day, but the way the movie did it was almost as good as the play. Except for these, all the changes from the play were improvements. My main criticism was that while the singing was good, some was not quite up to this very demanding score."

","I think that the last musical that I saw was Chicago and I really liked it so I thought that I would give this one a shot. Unlike Chicago, where there was some dialog between the songs, that was not the case in this film. There were very few spoken words and it took a little bit of getting used to. The story centers on a convict that had spent 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread and bad behavior. He finally gets paroled and decides to start a new life and violates his parole and becomes a prominent business man. This man is Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who ends up adopting the daughter of a prostitute named Fantine (Anne Hathaway). Javert (Russell Crowe) is the determined inspector that is dead set on hunting him down. All of this is going on at the brink of the beginning of the French Revolution. Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), the little girl that Jean adopts grows up and falls instantly in love with the rebellious revolutionary, Marius (Eddie Redmayne). I thought that I would be kind of bored by the middle of the film, but the film actually gets better. I think that the fact that the singing was done while they were actually shooting the film (instead of being dubbed in), gave the scenes more depth and emotion. The actors acted with an earpiece and there was a guy on the set that played the music in their ear. They added in the ""big"" music later. I can see why Anne Hathaway was nominated for a SAG and Golden Globe. She did an outstanding job on the films signature song (I dream a dream). I also want to mention the young actors/singers in the film; Isabelle Allen who played the young Cosette and Daniel Huttlestone who was the miniature revolutionary mascot Gavroche. Both young actors have a bright career ahead of them. This is one of those films that if you love the classics (as I do), then it is definitely a must see. If not, this is one that may change your mind. This was a big story to tell on screen and director Tom Hooper definitely got it right. I know that this is yet another long film, but it is worth it. Although it does indeed contain a lot of misery, I am going to give this film a green light."

","My wife and I saw this Christmas day at the local cineplex - a wonderful musical and emotional experience.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Anne Hathaway as Fontine, and Samantha Barks as Esponine deliver emotional charged, brilliantly musically acted performances.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper (director) made a conscientious decision to have all dialog sung live while filming and it works beautifully. The emotion in many scenes is palpable! Anne Hathaway's ""Dreamed a Dream"" about a quarter into the film is exceptional and left very few dry eyes in the theater.<br/><br/>Jackman, Hathaway, Barks, and Hooper should all win awards for this awesome movie."
