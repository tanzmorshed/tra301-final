","I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.<br/><br/>The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.<br/><br/>What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.<br/><br/>I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Let me just tell you that, as a middle aged film buff, I have seen my share of flicks, good and bad. Very few rate as high as ""The Game"" in entertainment value. ""The Game"" is most definitely one of the ""most fun"" movies to hit the silver screen in a long time. Filled with plot twists and turns, this film takes the movie-goer on a psychological roller coaster ride from the tile screens to the final credit roll.<br/><br/>""The Game"" is truly an intelligent tale, sort of a brain teaser that you get to watch and listen to, with a time limit. You have just 128 minutes to solve this, and chances are, like me, you'll be hanging on the solution to this puzzle until the very end.<br/><br/>The script was well written by a writer who clearly understands the needs of an adult audience. Yes, we like our fun but we like to exercise our brains once in a while also. And let there be no mistake about the great performances offered here by Michael Douglas and his co-stars. I was engrossed by all and couldn't take my eyes of the screen.<br/><br/>There is plenty for everybody here. Fun for all. A big winner in my book and definitely on my list of all time favorites. Get it and enjoy the ride!"

","What an amazing thriller, it's totally original, i've never seen anything like it before. The casting of Michael Douglas and Sean Penn was inspired and the story is compelling to say the least.<br/><br/>Nicholas Van Orton (Douglas) receives a strange birthday gift from his brother Conrad (Penn) A game, that's the gift, a game that plunges him into a living nightmare; a conspiracy (or so it appears) Life or death, true or false; The Game poses many questions and is steeped in mystery and tension from the moment it begins.<br/><br/>All the questions do get answered by the end, and the surprise ending caps off this thriller excellently.<br/><br/>Terrific entertainment 8/10"

","""The Game"" took me on one psychological thrill ride after another loaded with twists and turns scene after scene.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas pulled off his best performance as Nicholas Van Orton a man who is approaching his birthday. Upon which he receives an invitation to play a game given to him by his brother Conrad played by Sean Penn. Nicholas reluctantly agrees and soon finds out that the game is more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film because I never knew who was trustworthy or what was going to happen next, this truly was one film that must be seen by those who enjoy never knowing for sure how a movie will turn out.<br/><br/>
""The Game"" is all Michael Douglas and how well he pulls off his role of being the innocent who happens to be in the middle of a game he can't control. However, a really good movie can not be pulled off by one actor, a whole lot of credit should go to Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger for their convincing portrayals in this film."
"Benzzo","10","246","327","2 August 1998"," As gripping as it gets.
","Whether you love it or hate it, The Game definitely will not bore you.  By far the most engrossing movie I've ever watched.  I saw this on the big screen and throughout most of this masterpiece I kept asking myself, ""where is this movie going?""  For 128 spirited minutes The Game takes your mind and twists it ruthlessly, contorting it in any way it so desires.  Michael Douglas is the perfect actor for this role, he played it flawlessly.  I love this movie, it's definitely one of my personal favorites."
"MaxBorg89","9","46","57","20 May 2007"," Tight, twisted and tense - one of the most interesting thrillers of the '90s
","Having conquered the critics (and the box-office) with Se7en, David Fincher could have ""sold out"" and kept delivering more of the same. Fortunately, he was wise enough to try different paths, and although all his movies can be classified as thrillers there's no real similarity between them, except maybe a common theme of alienation and solitude.<br/><br/>In Fincher's third film, The Game, that solitude is physically incarnated by Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy businessman who is so obsessed with his job he has forgotten everything about the simple joys of life. The only person who still stays in touch with him is his younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn), who is Nicholas' polar opposite in terms of attitude. One night, when they're out to celebrate the elder brother's birthday, Conrad mentions a ""game"" that changed his life and suggests Nicholas participate too, as it would be ""fun"". Though initially hesitant, the latter eventually gives in to curiosity and decides to give it a shot. Within a few hours, however, he will regret it: the ""game"" is actually some sort of conspiracy involving everyone in town. With his assets frozen, his apartment no longer a safe place and no one left to trust, Nicholas must figure out how to solve the problem before it's too late - for him or someone else...<br/><br/>As usual, Fincher makes sure the film works on a technical level, cleverly using camera angles, lighting (shades of red and brown being the dominant color) and editing to keep the suspense alive and the atmosphere conveniently murky. It is mainly this masterful handling of film-making tools that keeps the viewer from questioning the logic of the nonetheless brilliant screenplay, some of the twists giving the impression of a dystopic set-up rather than a plausible situation (and yet the script is supposedly based on a real event). Two other elements contribute to elevating The Game above the average mystery tale: a truly unpredictable, phenomenal ending, in pure Fincher tradition (well, at least until he made Panic Room), and the great work by the leading men, Douglas' paranoid desperation slyly erasing all hints of typecasting (after all, this is not the first time he has played someone who is being manipulated; in fact, one scene explicitly spoofs one of those previous movies) and Penn's smug anarchy anticipating director's masterpiece, Fight Club, and its central character, Tyler Durden (without a doubt Brad Pitt's best role to date).<br/><br/>In short, those looking for a ""different"" cinematic experience should give The Game a try: it might come off as overly cold or contrived at first, but like all of Fincher's movies it deserves a re-evaluation (Fight Club wasn't exactly a hit when originally released) and stands the test of time as one of the most original, smartest films of the '90s."
"Theo Robertson","7","111","148","5 December 2005"," Worth Watching - But Only Once
","THE GAME is the type of movie that was very popular at the turn of the century - One that has a great twist in the tail . Unfortunately when the great twist is revealed the film comes crashing down . The producers may claim that that THE GAME is more of a journey than a destination whereby the audience are transported somewhere but the more you think about the plot at the end of the line the more the audience will complain that the journey was a little too contrived to be worth going back on the same route <br/><br/>!!!! SPOILERS !!!! The premise involves "" what do you get for the man who has everything "" , Nicholas Van Orton has everything we wants in a material world but it's come at a price where he's a lonely middle aged man and you're instantly reminded of Michael Douglas Oscar winning role in WALL STREET as Gordon Gekko . His brother Conrad buys him a birthday gift from Consumer Recreation Services and then all sorts of strange and dangerous things start happening <br/><br/>The problem with the scenario is that when the ending is revealed your suspension of disbelief may not have been suspended enough . The comments pages for this film is full of people pointing out things like "" What if Nicholas got mugged in Mexico, or if he jumped off a different part of the building or if he did or didn't contact such and such a person ? he wouldn't have arrived at the ending "" and they're right . In fact if you stop to think about it it also means that every single previous customer who used CRS must had a successful time other wise the customer would have sued the company in a multi million pound court case . Are you trying to say all that excitement wouldn't have caused a previous customer to have a heart attack or be seriously injured , perhaps even killed ? Why do you think no one in real life has come up with something like CRS in real life ? That's because of the real life possibility of litigation <br/><br/>I do confess that I'm taking things a little too serious and people will point out that it's only a film and they're right . For most of the running time I found THE GAME rather compelling entertainment similar to TOTAL RECALL without the high body count and sci-fi elements and though everything disintegrates with the revelation I do recommend THE GAME as entertainment mixed in with a redemption plot"

","Nicholas Van Orton, a successful businessman lives a good life until an unexpected birthday gift from his brother destroys it all. Nicholas has been enrolled in a game - ""a profound life experience"" that begins quietly but soon erupts in a rush of devastating events. Van Orton has to win this deadly game or lose control of everything in his life. And this time money and power are meaningless. This is a suspense/thriller, that does manage to hold one's attention. The film stars Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Deborah Kara Unger (David Cronenberg's ""Crash"") turns in a fine supporting roll as well. Davd Fincher, director of Seven and Aliens 3, continues to set high standards for motion picture making. This lastest entree of Fincher's does not lose a beat in delivering the maximum impact of the story. This movie will get into your head. It will keep you guessing the whole time. If you don't give this movie a chance you'll never know what you missed."

","Very few films have captured my attention the way The Game did. Every turn, every corner seemed to have some hint of intrigue and deception. This film would be the life's work for any major film maker, but then again, this David Fincher were talking about.<br/><br/>Years from now, when Fincher is honored with his lifetime achievement award at the Academy Awards, his true fans will always remember this film. It put a whole new twist on the idea of ""plot-twist."" One of the few films me and my father both liked (we never agree on any film)."
"silarpac","5","7","7","27 February 2018"," Good start, then the ending was bad.
","This film made sense up to about 3/4 of the way through. We had a suspense crime drama with exciting plot twists and a Scrooge-like protagonist getting his comeuppance, so far so good. But at the end the writers decide to throw a plot curve ball that misses the strike zone by a mile. It turns out that all the machine guns, explosions, attempted murder, and psychological terror was just a joke and it was all just good clean fun. Huh? Who would pay an organization to drive their client to the point of attempting suicide??? Why the client's brother of course! He did it because his brother was becoming ""such an asshole"" and he wanted to help him. <br/><br/>This was a reworking of the Christmas Carol plot except in this version Scrooge isn't taught anything about goodness or love for his fellow man. He is just terrorized to the point of madness and the audience is supposed to accept this as a good thing to do. In the end he accepts that it was all for the best and even thanks the brother and offers to pay for half of the cost of the plot to terrorize him. I gave the movie a five because it was really well done up till the ending but these filmmakers have their moral values frapped in a blender."

","This has to be one of the more interesting psychological thrillers made recently.  Just when you think you got ahold of the plot it changes! Playing with ""the implicit viewer"" this movie has a tendency to constantly surprise and redefine itself in relation to the ""expectancy horizon"". What a wonderful positive redefinition of ""Seven"", culminating in a refinement of the human nature and at the same time leaving the viewer with a subtle taste of the ""rosicrucian initiation"" in the mouth.<br/><br/>Definitly worth a view!"

","I was hungry like anything when I started watching this movie and that was the only time I felt hungry. 2 hours and 3 minutes passed like you are playing your favorite GAME and could not concentrate anything else. If you think Micheal Douglas is an over rated actor then this movie is enough to prove you wrong. Sean Penn does full justice to his cameo. This is not a movie that leaves you with puzzles after watching unlike many mystery thrillers, instead it solves itself and relaxes your muscles after a rough ride. This is a movie with an engrossing script, excellent acting and flawless direction. If you have not watched this movie yet then PLAY it. You wont regret it all. Entertainment at its best. Now I can have my snacks and you go watch it. 8/10"
"Confidante77","8","75","104","28 January 2007"," An extremely underrated movie
","After the great success, both with critics and with the public, of ""Seven"", Director David Fincher turned to this film. It has often been said that this movie was one he'd wanted to make for a long time and upon viewing you can really see his belief in both characters and the story- overall an excellently directed movie.<br/><br/>Although several people argued that ""Seven"" was gory, in my opinion it wasn't, for example, there is a total lack of blood in the Lust scene, something which I particularly admired- the fact that a director could make a chilling and shocking movie without resorting to piling tons of blood onto the screen. Fincher continues this streak in ""The Game"" by drawing the tension and shocks of the film by using psychological terror.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie could not parallel the success of ""seven"" upon its release and also received mixed critical reviews, however since then it has become somewhat of a cult movie with far more success on DVD than in the box office.<br/><br/>Perhaps most notable about the film is the fact that (apparently) Fincher himself often seems to direct his actors in a detached way, the way one might move around chess pieces in a game. Whether this is 100% true or not his direction, the acting and just about everything else is superb."
"rmax304823","6","91","129","2 November 2003"," Who Dealt This Mess?
","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>I think it was Chuang Dz who is supposed to have asked: ""Last night I dreamed I was a butterfly. Today, am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?""<br/><br/>The question, like this movie and many others before it, deals with the problem of distinguishing what is real from what is illusory. An old philosophical question. But this movie does a pretty good job of exploring the issue.<br/><br/>The plot, basically is this. Sean Penn enrolls his brother Michael Douglas in something called ""the game."" Douglas enrolls in this program, a birthday present, without having any idea of what it's all about. Douglas is an extremely wealthy control freak who lives a life encased in ice. He's brutal to subordinates, frosty to friends, and lives alone and likes it. Then things begin to go wrong. First little things. His pen leaks and stains his shirt at the airport. A waitress spills wine all over him at his favorite restaurant. A man seems to drop dead in front of him. Then things spin wildly out of control. People shoot at him. His bank accounts are emptied by the people running the game. A wild taxi ride ends up with him trapped in the car at the bottom of San Francisco Bay. He's drugged by someone he trusts and wakes up dressed in rags, his nose bloodied, with no ID and no money, in a rubbish-strewn Mexican graveyard. This has happened to me once or twice and I can tell you -- it's discomfiting. <br/><br/>It's like an episode from The Twilight Zone or John Fowles' novel ""The Magus"". Or, citing cinematic history, like the pod people or Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or Steve Railsback in ""The Stuntman."" Who belongs to the conspiracy and who doesn't. Or does ANYBODY not belong? And, as a birthday present, this ""game"" is like one of those really ugly ties that somebody gives you, that you know you'll never wear, but you can't take it back either.<br/><br/>Douglas gives a surprisingly good performance. He has greater range than I'd previously given him credit for. He shows the same disdain for others that he did as Gordon Gekko but he brings a fragility to the character as well. When he sees mouth-to-mouth resuscitation being given to someone he displays what could easily pass for real disgust. And when he cuts his hand on a sliver of glass, he grimaces with pain while he rinses it and wraps it in a handkerchief, the way the adventurer of ""Romancing the Stone"" would never do. And there is none of the comfortable matter-of-fact laid back quality he showed as a doctor and boy friend in ""Coma."" The other performers are competent but Douglas has the only role that stands out.<br/><br/>Interesting use of location shooting too. San Francisco doesn't look like an urban theme park here. Almost all the scenes take place at night on depopulated streets and they make San Francisco look about as ugly as it's possible to make the city look. The dialog doesn't leap out at you but it does have its quiet wit, which I'm not sure is always appropriate. Douglas loses a shoe to an attack dog. ""There goes a thousand dollars,"" he remarks to his companion. ""Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?"" she asks. ""That one did.""<br/><br/>At the movie's end, just when you think the game is over, there's yet another twist coming, the last one leading Douglas to suicide by jumping off the roof of a high-rise hotel, only to land safely on an air bag judiciously placed below in what looks like the lounge of the Sheraton Palace. The movie is entirely implausible. As explained at the end, there isn't a believable moment in it. But it has the kind of illogic that a real nightmare has. The viewer may realize afterward that what has happened is impossible but Douglas has no way of finding that out. Everything seems askew to him as it does to us while we watch. Even Daniel Schorr on CNN has an interactive exchange with him. ""This is impossible,"" says Douglas. ""That's right,"" replies Schorr. ""It's impossible. You're having a conversation with your TV set."" If you can't trust Daniel Schorr something is seriously screwed up.<br/><br/>Alas, the denouement does flunk the believability test, and badly. Douglas has been put through hell, and it all turns out for the best -- all those dangerous pranks, the living nightmare, the humiliation, the druggings, the action movie clichÃ©s, all have made him ""a better man."" He's grateful. Whereas a lot of fairly normal people, myself included, would try to track down every soul involved in this scam and beat the living crap out of them. I'd make a particular point of celebrating my brother Sean Penn's next birthday by crowning him with a crowbar -- a real one."
"Bogmeister","9","48","65","10 August 2005"," Play to the End of Your Life
","The Game weaves its way into and around your brain, challenging you to figure out the puzzle. It's a rather unique film experience because of that no-holds-barred challenge - it challenges you to figure out what's coming next, in a direct way not many other films attempt. It's a thinking person's film; whether it's actually intelligent or not probably depends on the individual, but I'd like to think it's pretty smart. Also pretty smart is the character played by Michael Douglas - business smarts, that is. Douglas was near the end of a roll playing businessmen, began in Wall Street(87). He becomes involved with an odd company, CRS, introduced to him by his younger brother (Sean Penn in a small role). What begins as amusing distraction for his orderly world soon turns sinister.<br/><br/>The film points out that people, especially smarter people whom you'd think don't need amusement, all need some kind of distraction. Isn't that what we're all doing essentially during our lifetimes - finding different means of distraction before the inevitable end? And aren't those distractions just a means to avoid thinking about that end? Douglas may be closer to that end than he thinks here. As the toying escalates and becomes dangerous, the viewer may think this has the makings of a slick, if standard, thriller, but that's not the case, to everyone's credit. You reach a point, however, when certain incidents demand suspension of disbelief, no matter how much you trust the filmmakers. How far can a man fall, for example, before you start to think there's a limit of how much I can buy into here? How much can be allowed, how much power can you allow for the puppeteers before a line is crossed? It crosses that line with me towards the end but reaching that point was an interesting experience, something I can say about too few films.<br/><br/>This was Fincher's middle film in his personal great trilogy, caught between ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club."" If there's one other minor quibble I might voice, it's that his stylistic flourishes are missing in this one - it's comparatively straightforward, even with the Super-8 type flashbacks, and I would have to rate this a smidgen below the other two. However, if I had to pick one to watch over and over, it would be The Game."

","I first saw this on VHS tape when it first came out. It was not in theaters long enough for word of mouth to drive a wave of references. This was the only movie I ever had to immediately rewind, gather the family and watch it again that night. Do not watch on TV where it is has been cut for time. What I liked about this film is that every frame and every scene was important to the story. There are no puppy in the window filler shots. I applaud the writing and the directing for such an intricate weaving of ""The Game"" concept. Not a film for those with no patience or interest in covert operations. I now enjoy watching others watch this film as they start to recognize things and try to figure out what is going on, only to be wrong several times. I see something new every time I watch it. Brilliant concept and execution of the concept on film."
"hoobama","8","21","28","7 May 2006"," totally implausible, but who cares
","I was looking over my shoulder and racking my brain throughout this movie trying to figure out how the game always managed to stay one step ahead of Michael Douglas's character. Okay, so it asks you to accept some pretty wild premises and some fairly insane leaps of logic. Okay, so after you think about it, the suspense really has no sensible roots. The bottom line is that this movie is fun to watch.<br/><br/>There's really no way to so comprehensively map a person's every possible reaction that you could keep constantly abreast of him/her. I'm also not sure how sane the idea of plunging a taxi cab into water is, whether there's a supposed diver on the scene or not. And shipping the guy to Mexico in a box? Come on. I mean, at some point, this guy is going to come up with something the game-writers can't foresee. So the game itself, I just don't believe could work.<br/><br/>But the movie does. The viewer is brought into the game at the same speed as Nick Van Orton (Douglas), so the mystery works on two levels. It raises a number of questions, and although it doesn't satisfactorily answer them all (or even most of them), it still sends chills up your spine. What would you do if they seized your bank accounts, stole your identity, chased you, drugged you, and shipped you a thousand miles away in a coffin-sized box? It's creepy to think about it, even with your brain constantly untangling the overbearing contrivance that put it on screen in the first place.<br/><br/>The truth is that I was totally skeptical of the game all the way through and even after I saw the movie, but I just don't care. I liked watching it. I was entertained. And isn't that what the movies are all about?"

","""The Game"" is about a wealthy investment banker, called Nicholas Van Orton, who is given a mysterious birthday present by his brother Conrad. When he participates in this game, unusual events happen that interfere with his daily routine, endangering his life. The closer he gets to figuring out the master behind the game, the more dangerous the events get, making him become closer to death. He must risk everything he has to discover the deadly secret.<br/><br/>The director, David Fincher, creates this film in a great way. The earlier success of his previous film ""Seven"" gave the producers of ""The Game"" an opportunity to acquire a higher profit. The film was eventually ranked #44 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.<br/><br/>This thriller successfully holds suspense the whole way through. The incidents displayed throughout the film are shown in a sequence that continually makes us wonder what is happening, and the rapid change in events keeps us watching. There is a wide range of occurrences happening throughout the movie, which only make sense at the end of the story, so once we have seen a few of the experiences that Nicholas must go through, we are dragged into the film, continually wondering who is good, who is bad, and how the events all link together. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who likes mystery story's, thrills and suspense.

","I am a long time IMDb lurker, first time commenter. Allow me to start with my conclusion: I was flat out offended by this movie's supposition that I would be too blinded by senseless suspense to apply logic or rationality. This movie is simply incoherent and somehow tries to have profound meaning.<br/><br/>The Game is essentially a modern adaptation of the Ebenezer Scrooge story. The only notable difference being that The Game makes far less sense than the original (despite the fact that said original involves ghosts embodying the living dead and bilateral time travel). The viewer is to believe the protagonist is lead via elaborate scheming to have a life changing insight. Unfortunately for the scriptwriters, this scheming involves innumerable logical paradoxes. Any attempt to compile these retardations here would result in my death (likely by suicide). I can only hope that I may still sleep tonight knowing that, thanks to this movie, a throng of people think that so-called 'squib bullets' can pierce through the window of a BMW and pose no threat to anyone in the vicinity.<br/><br/>Do not see this movie."

","Conspiracies. Films tend to be made about conspiracies and mysteries. Everyone has conspiracy theories that they put in movies (""JFK,"" ""Conspiracy Theory""). ""The Game"" is a different kind of conspiracy. It is about an entire organization holding something against one man. Only a few people know about this organization and what it does in the movie, it seems. But if only a handful of people know about the organization, how could it possibly get booming business? That's one of the many, many plot holes that ""The Game"" seems to have. It just has too many plot holes to save itself. It has a pretty good plot, good acting, good directing...even a good script...but the plot holes in the script cause the problems.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas plays a rich businessman, whose birthday is coming up soon. Sean Penn, his younger brother, tells Douglas that he (Penn) has bought a present for Douglas called ""The Game."" Douglas goes to the location of The Game Headquarters (it has a name but I can't remember right now), and there he finds out that The Game Headquarters must test Douglas' health before they activate it (The Game). They ask him questions, do health tests...all of this going to use later...and then Douglas goes to dinner. At dinner, one thing leads to another and pretty soon things start happening. A hysterical Penn tells Douglas that he didn't have enough money to pay for The Game, and now The Game is coming after him. So now Douglas is caught up in this conspiracy which he may never get out of alive. Because now they're coming after him. Blackmail is only the beginning of what they'll do to Douglas.<br/><br/>First of all, ""The Game"" has a nice setup. I really enjoyed the beginning. It holds a great sense of suspense, and seems to be filmed effectively, in a very suspenseful way. It has all the markings of a Hitchcockian thriller. Unfortunately, Hitchcock would have ironed out the plot holes before he filmed the movie, because despite being a suspenseful film, the plot holes are unbearable, kind of negating all the suspense and belief in the film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>First of all, how does The Game know that Douglas is going to do everything he does? They're betting an awful lot that he will jump off the building at JUST the right spot to crash through JUST the right glass (if you've seen the film you'll know what I mean). I can't exactly go into the entire film--it would spoil the entire thing--but the plot holes in the movie are just too obvious. They are literally betting on every step Douglas will take, and while they have people to help him make decisions along the way, there are times that he is by himself...how do they know, in a moment of despair, he will not try to put a gun to his head?<br/><br/>At the end (major spoiler ahead), Douglas stands on the edge of a skyscraper with a gun. They make it look as though Douglas has just shot his brother (by accident). Douglas, on the verge of a mental breakdown, walks to the edge of the skyscraper and jumps. Here are two things.<br/><br/>1. How did they know Douglas wouldn't just lift the gun to his head and blow it off? Why jump off the building? Yeah, I know, that's what his father did and therefore Douglas would do the same--but what if he hadn't? If I were Douglas' character, just because my father jumps off a building doesn't mean that that would be my decision of effective suicide.<br/><br/>2. What if Douglas had jumped off the wrong point of the building? What if he all of a sudden, before anyone could do anything, he decided to run off the other end of the building? And even if he jumped off the building at the right point, what if a) the wind (there could be some strong gusts from that high up) blew him away from his destination, and b) from that speed, even fake glass would cut him up IF he reached his destination.<br/><br/>That's one of the things that got me, but really, the whole sake of the film lies on what Douglas will do. What if Douglas shot himself early on? What if the shock of thinking he killed his brother gave him a heart attack? What if he didn't get out of the underwater taxi and drowned? What if? If I were The Game, I wouldn't bet that much on a suicidal man."

","This movie was made not long after the movies ""The usual suspects"" and ""seven"" were made. Both of them had what is called a ""surprise ending"". I'd bet a year salary that ,after seeing the success of those films, some greedy producer told his stuff ""I want you to make me this kind of a movie!!"" so the writer first thoght of a surprising end and then had built a movie around it, I don't buy for a second all the other analysis of the movie about ""inner layers"" or some other crap. This movie was meant to make some money by having a surprise ending and that is all. Well, don't get me wrong I love those kind of movies but I hate when I'm presented with something so illogical and insulting to the intelligence. let me explain why: No one is that smart period. no one can predict what someone is gonna do so accurately, it is IMPOSSIBLE. Imagine a crime scene filled with potential clues, it might take a lot of time figuring out the relevant clues and figuring out who is the killer. Now suppose you know exactly who did it and why, so now (suppose you want to look smart) you know exactly what clues are relevant and how to build the chain of evidence that will lead you to the cuLprit. do that and all the other detectives will think you're the smartest man in the world - It is very easy to know what to do in retrospect. and that is exactly the error of the movie - the writer knew the ending and builT the entire movie around it ,because he knew the answer it is easy to reconstruct the questions! so it easy for him to forsee the hero's actions. but ,as I said, No one is smart enough in real life. You think that someone might be? well. for example, there is a famous problem in physics called the 3 body problem: you have 3 bodies revolving around each other and you have to know (knowing the start \ point) their position after an arbitrary time. the equations governing their movement aren't very complicated but even the most powerful supercomputers cannot do that in a reasonable time. only 3 bodies!!!<br/><br/>And in the movie we have much much much more complicated thing -real people, the real world etc. so You're gonna tell me that a small group of actors can predict all what the hero would do in such accuracy? don't make me laugh.<br/><br/>As i said this movie was made to make money by having a surprise ending and It has done so and let all laws of logic be gone to hell.<br/><br/>this movie was awful and an utter insult to the intelligence of anyone with I.Q over 60."
"secondtake","7","9","12","8 December 2011"," Twists upon twists, amazing filming, stunning acting, and a preposterous end
","The Game (1997)<br/><br/>The steely intensity of Michael Douglas comes to play once again here in a role where that determination keeps getting waylaid by the mixed-up birthday present he's been handed, somewhat against his will. <br/><br/>Or against his better judgement, at first, because he does sign off on playing ""The Game,"" which is an experience with a bow. That is, without any good clues about who the players are or why it's quite happening, except that his birthday has come and gone, events begin to happen around him that are inexplicable. And that he can't ignore.<br/><br/>Intensity rules. Douglas, playing the obscenely wealthy Nicholas Van Orton, gets led further and further into the madness and crime and murder of this huge huge charade. Or so it seems.<br/><br/>In a manner the director, David Fincher, is cozy with, reality bends but psychology seems to be solid. That is, you are secure, somehow, in the main actor's head as the world distorts. The main example is of course ""The Fight Club,"" the distortions are almost literal in the more ordinary ""Panic Room,"" and the world is somewhat friendlier in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Yes, these are all Fincher films (as is the brand new American version ""Dragon Tattoo"" flick and the riveting ""Se7en"").<br/><br/>The production and the shooting and editing in particular are all first rate, classic Fincher. Douglas plays his part with conviction and you end up not quite sympathizing with him (he's a spoiled jerk even as his world evaporates) but you certainly are in his shoes, wondering what is going on. It's crazy and exciting and certainly baffling for a viewer--which is part of the game, actually. The viewer is another layer in the layers of perceivable reality.<br/><br/>And then it just goes too far. In a way, the film is preposterous from the start, but yet you go along with the idea because very rich people have very unusual lives, and maybe this kind of mind-trip birthday present with lots of people participating could happen. Money moves mountains. But when things get almost comically absurd, when the twists of identity and loyalty keep happening, you want to just say, walk away. Get a grip. Refuse to play, or maybe (at least) refuse to believe things like this are possible.<br/><br/>This is where Michael Douglas is perfect, and maybe does what few actors could pull off. Because as it gets insane, his character toughs it out. He's the type to take a challenge, to get extreme, to be risky, to protect his self-interests without surrender.<br/><br/>In some ways it's a great movie, so watch it as if it'll never let you go. And when it's just too much, be glad you went along for as long as you did. And enjoy the rest of the show for its theatrics. It remains really well made all through."

Probably like me, he was busy holding back the tears when he realised that his brother was alive. The outcome of the game, in the end, is based on the strength of a brothers love. It's clear that Nicholas would do anything for Conrad, and that's why he plays the stupid game in the beginning.

I say. IT'S A FILM.<br/><br/><br/><br/>IT'S A FILM.<br/><br/>The whole idea of this film is to make you suspend your disbelief for 2 hours. and get you to see how someone might react if their every move was just part of some elaborate game that eventually has you believing it is real. As for those who say ""I would have killed them all at the end"" answer me this. If you have a brother (I have three), if you believed you killed him only to find out he is still alive would you instantly want to send him back to the grave....  I think not.<br/><br/>

","I was really looking forward to this film given that it was Fincher's follow-up to the superb ""Se7en"" and that the cast contained Sean Penn. For me, Fincher is the most exciting director working in Hollywood today and has rarely put a foot wrong either in his technique or his script choices. Sean Penn is a maverick whose colourful life off screen adds barely needed interest value to some eclectic films and performances.<br/><br/>A message to these two crew members: ""Sean, I can't really blame you for the debacle that is the end result of this film, I just wish you'd expunge it from your CV. David, what were you doing? Unless it was the studio's decision to foist off that pathetic ending on the audience, you made a serious error of judgement; so far the only one in your otherwise brilliant career, but an error nonetheless. Here's hoping that ""The Panic Room"" will once more fully showcase the brilliance I've come to expect from yourself..."" <br/><br/>Usually, a film has to have several bad points before I will stoop to awarding a '1' rating on IMDb, but this is one film where the ending is so inconceivably awful as to negate everything good that has gone before. Fincher does a neat line in edgy suspense and for most of the film this is showcased brilliantly. However, as I remember, this is quite a long film and towards the end my patience was stretched by the seeming lack of an impending payoff. I started to idly wonder about the possible climax, with each new thought being more innovative and thrilling than the last. Then the movie delivers, and it's such a letdown. I was expecting Fincher to keep with the 'dark' themes he has exploited so well in all his other movies, but instead of a visceral sucker punch we get the movie being far too literal. As such, any second viewing would most likely be pointless, since then you'll know that all the posturing of the slow-burn build up leads to something completely empty. Not that I was planning to sit through a well-done first half again to get to its shallow conclusion. Once was enough. The single biggest cinematic disappointment of my life.

When he is put through the strenuous ""application"" tests and is told he was not accepted he gets defensive. Little does he know, the game has already begun!

","I don't tend to write reviews on IMDb, but saw this gem and was compelled to do so simply due to the fact it isn't mentioned AT ALL, by anyone. It's one of Fincher's best films and deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Fight Club, Se7en etc etc.<br/><br/>It starts by slowly showing us the world of Nicholas (Michael Douglas) and how he's alone on his 48th birthday. He receives and odd gift off of his brother which he then decides to follow up on. What follows then is sheer cinematic brilliance. It's dark, unpredictable and unrelenting. It got to a point where any single character couldn't be trusted, and it made it all the more gripping. Seeing the protagonist descend slowly into desperation made us feel empathy for him. There's not much to say other than it's a typical Fincher film. Including his long tracks, his persistent use of the tripod, and I think it really compliments the story and builds up this sense of unease. <br/><br/>I just needed to express my gratitude for everyone who worked on this film and obviously David Fincher himself. It's so underrated and should be classed as one of his best films - without a shadow of a doubt.<br/><br/>Enjoy. You won't want it to end."
"SteveReed007","1","25","44","26 March 1999"," A cinematic abomination, shamelessly manipulative
","The worst aspect of this film is how the creators don't care to follow through on their convictions. They are clearly nihilistic. Instead of showing this, they play on the desire of the audience members for something coherent. I left the theater (and my viewing of snippets when I run across it in channel surfing) with a feeling of physical violation, of having had depraved intellects smeared across my brain.<br/><br/>Too harsh? I don't think so. One is expected to empathize with Michael Douglas's character, in trying to understand that all of his arbitrary injuries are in fact aspects of an incredibly complex practical joke. (No, I'm not going to dignify it with the noun ""game."") Yet one is expected, simultaneously, to believe that some malign organization is genuinely trying to destroy him.<br/><br/>The problem with this tension is that if Douglas's free will is ever asserted, the plot (such as it is) instantly collapses. He can't be too smart. He can't think outside a limited set of boxes. He can't match up facts in any way that shows insight -- or else the joke-makers will not be successful in anticipating what he is doing. In short, the story depends on Douglas's character being precisely as vapid as everybody expects of him at his worst, and that he won't give up until they think it best for him to give up.<br/><br/>If Douglas, here, believes the premise of a malign power, he would be more likely to slip up -- with a deadly result for himself or someone else -- out of sheer overconcentration on his situation. Too much stress, y'know? You aren't at your most perceptive. Especially with a gun in your pocket. The plot counts upon his virtues, as dullard as they are, while at the same time undercutting all of them.<br/><br/>The final twist involves the apparent death of someone truly close to him, at his own hand. Yet did it happen? And is such a shock something to be used to deprive -any- human being of personal dignity? So much so that, shortly afterwards, he's expected to recover and be mindlessly festive? I found this to be an instance of psychological torture. If I wanted this, I'd watch the war in Yugoslavia, and CNN has nearly zero marginal cost.<br/><br/>That brilliant cinematography, adept character acting (on occasion), and Douglas's dogged persistence are used all create no excuse for such incoherent manipulation. All we have is a canker on the human spirit.<br/><br/>This is a nihilistic cesspool. Don't waste your money, not even on a 99-cent bargain rental night. If you possess any human sensibilities, you'll berate yourself later... when it isn't giving you nightmares."

Director David Fincher did a masterful job of taking a well written, but very far fetched, story and knitted it together with great performances by Michael Douglas (spectacular), Deborah Kara Unger, Sean Penn, and brilliant atmospherics that make this a stomach twister from beginning to end, and end, and end, (there are three). When viewing a film like this you have to ask or answer only one question. Does it suspend your disbelief long enough for you to go along with what you're seeing and have the required emotional response for the story to move forward? The answer here is, YES. <br/><br/>If not for Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger this could not have worked. Douglas, as Nicholas Van Orten, brings the audience along with him on a terrifying journey, The Game, from his perch high above the financial world to his complete ruin, destitution, and eventual suicide. It is a wild and scary ride and at least once I jumped right out of my seat. Deborah Kara Unger, as Kristine, had an equally challenging job and I loved how she did it. She is the chameleon in the story. She deftly blends into whatever phase the story is at and you're never quite sure if she's a killer, a thief, the mastermind, or your best friend. How she does this is amazing to watch. A simple turn of her head can send a chill up your spine and you suddenly know (or think you know) she's not who you thought she was. When Van Orten confronts her with her fake first communion picture she's toast. Or so you think. Without missing a beat she walks right up to him and whispers, ""they're watching"". It's chilling. I love performances that are quiet and mysterious and hers is as good as they come. <br/><br/>The original music by Howard Shore is brilliant. The score, as far as I can tell, uses only a few strings, piano, and a very haunting French Horn. So simple, but so effective. Other popular songs dot the movie and that's where my only complaint of this film comes in. I love the song ""White Rabbit"" by Jefferson Airplane. And it's used to great affect in this film to scare the crap out of you. And so from now on when I hear it I'll think about getting the crap scared out of me. Thanks. <br/><br/>This really could have been a disaster. It's very well written but without Fincher's direction and a brilliant cast all bringing their ""A"" game it would never have worked. The holes in the plot, well itemized here at this site, are many. But it is still suspenseful and frightening and believable long enough for you to be taken in completely.

Many people talk about the implausibility of Nicholas just happening to find the 'sweet spot' to jump from and other similar occurrences. I would guess that these are the same folks who grouse about the benign landing of the spacecraft from Krypton - right after they watch a movie about a man flying around in tights and a cape. It's the utter implausibility of it all that makes the story. Actually this movie is like the butterfly effect - with thousands of possible variations, every one of Nicholas' actions, if not perfectly taken at the exact moment necessary, would ruin the outcome. It boggles the mind but makes for great cinema. I think the movie is really about Nicholas, a solitary man who believes he is in total control of a life scarred by his father's death and the responsibility he shoulders as a result. The Game continually undermines that control until, at the end, he surrenders, emotionally and physically. Compare Nicholas' body language from early in the movie to when he is led off the giant airbag - Michael Douglas pulls it off beautifully. I wonder if he got into the cab with Christine..."

","An oldie but a goodie.<br/><br/>I hadn't seen this movie for a good many years. Made back when Douglas was in his acting prime.<br/><br/>It moves at a steady pace with good flow. The surprises are plentiful given the basic premise. <br/><br/>Considering the lack of CGI and the effort in the script I wonder if we will see anything of its type come out of studios in more modern times?<br/><br/>Let's hope to see a movie of similar calibre some time soon."

","The ""paranoia thriller"" is a formula-based movie genre - some individual has his or her nice comfortable life overturned by some external agent, usually with a malevolent motivation, which results in the poor victim / protagonist going on the run, with their entire support network (financial, social, residential, identity, everything) in tatters.<br/><br/>The good thing about this particular formula is that it hasn't been overused. This means that films falling into this pattern (The Net, Pacific Heights) come across as fresh and pleasing. The Game is another good example. Nicholas (Michael Douglas), a hard-nosed business man, having cut himself off from his entire family through work, suddenly finds himself embroiled in the Game, given to him as a birthday present by his estranged brother Conrad (Sean Penn). As the conspiracy underpinning The Game becomes clearer, it destroys every element of Nicholas's life (and also Conrad's). Nicholas fights as best he can against this unstoppable and faceless conspiracy, but...<br/><br/>This thriller is intelligent, fast-paced, exciting, and involving. All the cast are excellent, and Douglas succeeds in making the unlikeable Nicholas someone who we ultimately sympathise with. If you haven't seen it, it is well worth catching."

His brother has the idea: A ""Game"", tailored to the recipient. when he accepts the present and starts his ""game"", changes his life radically. He loses the control, his financial empire and even fights for survival, because ""the Game"" knows no rules...<br/><br/>David Fincher created a thriller that is suspense to the last minute and full of good actors, especially Douglas and Penn. This is definitely not a movie for people that like to ""turn off"" their brain while watching movies. you need to focus on the movie every minute to understand the ending (which is also very good).<br/><br/>it's probably not Fincher's best, but I liked this one most (my opinion!).

"blanbrn","8","6","9","2 November 2007"," One of the best films of 1997. Mind thrilling with fun entertainment and suspense!
","Of all the films I saw in the year 1997, this ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas has to be one of the best. Because really you don't see any complex plot twist, and the the film is thrilling and suspenseful with a hard and direct pressed acting performance from Douglas. I really too liked the story and thrilling mood from director David Fincher. You have Michael Douglas as millionaire businessman financier Nicholas Van Orton who's very successful yet he's lonely and carries a very uptight personality while living in his San Francisco mansion. So one day younger brother the more liberal and free spirited Conrad(Sean Penn) gives Nicholas a birthday present a gift card from a corporate company called consumer recreation services(CRS) for as Conrad says the experience and pleasure of a lifetime that this game will add all the fun and entertainment to your life that's missing. So Nicholas tries the service out, and one by one his life starts to get creepy, unpredictable, and very strange in very unusual ways. Many of the moments and scenes are memorable from his talking TV developing it's own voice, the clown left in front of his home entrance, to his meeting of a sexy blonde waitress Christine(Deborah Kara Unger)and most of all his taxi cab one night takes a plunge off the golden gate bridge! This nonsense starts to drive him crazy as the worry starts to make him wonder if he will end up like his father and meet a tragic end the past haunts him so much. Only to find out how it ends is strange and simple it really surprises the viewer the first time they watch. Overall really a fine done film with good acting from Douglas and the story was a neat concept from Fincher with thrills and fun suspense and in it's day this film might have been a glimpse into the future form of identity theft. Anyway ""The Game"" still entertains and it's clearly one of 1997's best."

","Definitely worth a rent AT LEAST. Fincher's third movie stars Michael Douglas as the rich, cold and alone Nicholas Van Orton. His brother, Sean Penn, gets him a reality-life game from a company who specializes in creating different life games for different people based on their lives, history, likes and dislikes, etc. The object of the game: to figuare out what the object of the game is. Orton is very reluctant about the game, however you can tell he secretly is very intrigued by the idea. As you may guess and without revealing too much- things get out of hand very quickly and things are not what the seem. Michael Douglas is at the top of his game as well (pun intended). Personally, I find this to be one of his best movies he's ever made. All in all, this one is a must for thriller fans, Fincher fans, Douglas fans, and just about everyone else too. 8/10"

I can say that if I had a relative of mine do to me what Sean Penn did to Michael Douglas in this movie, when I went on trial for their death I can't see how I wouldn't be found as justifiable homicide.

The gift is 'The Game' it is apparently the next step in entertainment - an all-inclusive life experience, it may his brother claims change his life. The game is run by a company called CRS (Consumer Recreation Services), and before they let you play you are required to go through a complete battery of psychological and physical tests.<br/><br/>The story is intriguing, the performances are good and the production values are great. It's a little to long at 2hrs+ but that is only a minor complaint.

","David Fincher shows early signs of his mastery of the thriller genre with this film. The tone throughout the film really creates a great atmosphere and helps keep the mystery interesting. The ending doesn't feel quite as impactful or jaw-dropping as I would have hoped for given the terrific build up to it, but it still is pretty satisfying."
"ametallicaman1989","6","2","2","21 October 2018"," The ending...
","I really enjoyed about 95% of this movie. The ending however kinda undone and ruined everything else I saw before. The story is cool and the events that unfold really put you in his shoes with his confusion and bad luck. When it comes to that is was really just a surprise for his birthday. As unrealistic as some of the events he went through is. It is nothing compared to his nonchalant attitude after he finally finds out just bothered me. I would have much rather him go off on his brother and others or the ""game"" goes wrong and his brother or someone else really did die. Overall not awful but wouldnt care to watch again."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","17","34","9 May 2004"," Great, but could have been better
","David Fincher is almost always reliable to deliver some good thrills. Se7en is probably the best thriller I've ever seen, Panic Room is pretty exciting and I've heard a lot of good things about Fight Club. However, this one stands out, at least from Panic Room and Se7en, since pretty much nothing in this movie is what it seems. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the action scenes, and it keeps you wondering, up until the very last minute, what the hell is going on. Then you find out. I'm not saying the ending was downright bad, but it could definitely have used some improvement. It could have been worse, but it could also have been so much better. The end just seems to ruin a lot of the buildup of the rest of the film. Anyway, the plot is very good, a man who has everything, but isn't completely satisfied with his life, gets a chance to have some ""fun"". He takes it, and his life is changed forever. The acting is all good. The characters are well-written and credible. Actually, everything but the ending is top notch. The ending is the one reason that this movie doesn't get, at least, a 9. It just ruins so much of the movie, especially because the moment the definite end of the movie is reached, it feels empty. Up until that moment, you feel like you were watching a work of art, and then just before it ends in the same way that the rest of it has been, it cuts to some lame excuse for everything that happened in the movie up to that point, rather than a good explanation. I really wish they had made the ending better. Overall, a pretty good thriller, that could have been a masterpiece. I recommend this to fans of Fincher's other work, and fans of psychological thrillers altogether. 8/10"

","This movie is absolutely wonderful. It's the best movie I've seen in months. Sure, the ending leaves you with a 'what the hell just happened' sort of feeling, but it's not irritating, as it sometimes can be. It's a lot of fun to watch and the plot twists are in no way predictable. Even when I thought the movie was once again in reality, it wasn't. The movie totally turned into a case of 'where does the game begin and where does it end?'. I really enjoyed trying to figure out what the game was, who was in it, and why the people at CRS were so relentless. Because if the people at CRS (spoiler, I suppose) were only trying to screw Nicholas Van Orton over, why didn't they just stop once they made him look crazy and got control of all aspects of his life? Truly a magnificent film. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers."

In the end it was obvious what was going to happen, but the ridiculous idea that someone could have planned and anticipated every action that someone might take was beyond absurd to say the least.<br/><br/>Then of course we can just fall through a window and be perfectly ok.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound too rude, the film wasn't that bad, but to claim that it was clever and has a shock ending, is ridiculous.  The film was silly, unbelievable and very predictable."
"onepotato2","1","17","36","8 January 2002"," Terrible!
","There are two reactions to this movie - People like it or hate it. Put me in the second camp. Whether it was ""The Freshman"" or ""The Truman Show,"" you've seen this bad, bad movie before. It's the wish fulfillment of the arrogant. It goes something like this in ""the Game:"" You may be an a**hole but you're such an important a**hole that everyone in your life (even Daniel Shor) is playacting just for your benefit, just to guide you to a lesson. It still flatters self-important d**kheads into thinking that people in their lives are pawns manipulated for their benefit.<br/><br/>Regardless of continual trick endings, you've already suspected the whole thing is a ruse, because if it's not, it's a pretty standard and boring conspiracy thriller. The movie has a few funny moments early on then it becomes mysterious, then it become more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then... Get the picture? Did you really want me to say ""more mysterious"" again? No! Because part of the fun of a mystery is being allowed to play along. Providing developments instead of underlining the mystery again and again. ""Contact"" did this beautifully. Although it eventually gets nowhere, every fifteen minutes or so you're allowed to see a little more of a full picture. Here, the mystery just deepens without any actual developments. Wasn't anyone in a preview shouting, ""Yes, David WE GET IT!""? It gets so tedious that I actually skipped three or four chapters onthe DVD. I just didn't care. It reminded me of ""Total Recall"" and ""Sleuth."" 2 other movies that wear you out with pointless plot-twists and reversals.<br/><br/>Hollywood airheads think they recognize this as an idea film. ""The Game"" remains a game to no matter to what absurd scale it grows, even though there is no way you could even anticipate the random causes and effects in a single day of your life. Free will is completely erased in this movie. That's just how smart the controllers of the game are. Sadly David Fincher isn't that smart and there are plot-holes you could throw talentless scriptwriters through. How did they know where he'd jump off the building? Don't ask such silly questions! Surface effects are much more important than credibility. And that final ""wow' ending (Think of this movie as a really long tedious sermon) matters more than any internal logic. As idea films go, this one tugs - If rich pompous businessmen require a ruse this elaborate and expensive, who would actually care about them?<br/><br/>Finchers ideas are really lame. I can now add this to the list of very bad Fincher movies. Seven, Alien 3, and it's so bad that it even makes me reconsider Fight Club and it's lame ending.<br/><br/>The people I know who like this movie are self-important blowhards most in need of a lesson like this. I knew enough to suspect their raves. I would jam this baby into my top five worst movies of all time list."

"Jacques98","1","13","27","3 December 2008"," A ridicules, well-done thriller. Wait . . . what?
","The Game doesn't try to be anything except a standard, well-done thriller with an intelligent moral. In David Fincher's mind, that was all he was trying to accomplish. Did he do it? Well . . . I'm not sure I have a definitive opinion either way.<br/><br/>On a technical level, The Game certainly succeeds. David Fincher knows how to use a camera, and I'm not sure anyone, including the most negative reviews of this film, could say otherwise. The Game creates a flawlessly dark atmosphereliterally, but not so much figuratively. Instead of jumping on the wagon and trashing the viewer over the head with horror clichés as similar movies do, The Game slowly builds up to its over-the-top moments in an attempt to immense the viewer in reality before going into the unbelievable. If this movie were in the hands of any other director but Fincher, it would have been the single biggest cliché-fest in cinematic history because it wouldn't practice any subtly whatsoever. For example, the clown in the opening of the movie was fully grounded in The Game, but in any other movie would have just looked like a cliché prop. This is a credit I do have to give Fincher . . .<br/><br/>But it's also a credit I have to take back by the end of the movie. Simply put, I've seen a lot of unbelievable movies, and I usually vouch for them. ""Unbelievable movies are rarely as unbelievable as real life,"" is something you'll always hear me say. Not so with The Game. At all. By the midway point, the level of ridicules things happening brought to me to the point of laughing. Though other reviews have taken the time to carefully label and point out every plot hole, there is one big one that few people are seeing. The people behind the game could not know every single move the main character would make to such a precise degree. Period. When you finally figure this out by the middle of the movie, the entire plot become worthless and very formulated.<br/><br/>The other major problem I had with The Game is it's absolutely nothing new or original in the least. Thriller writers have used this exact plot so many times it's second nature to the hardcore thriller fan, such as myself.<br/><br/>And when I say ""rehash"" I mean it in every way I can. The Game is so slow-paced and tedious, not to mention repetitious, I could honestly see people shouting ""We get it, come on!"" at the screen. Oh the irony: what is the point of a thriller if it isn't thrilling? Entertainment valuealongside originalityis almost a dead concept among modern directors, isn't it? They're so fixed on making sure their movies have some sort of cliché, pretentious social commentary they forget that watching a movie was once, dare I say it, a fun thing to do.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. When I say movies lack entertainment value, that doesn't mean I'm not all for movies that scar the viewer and show them something meaningful, but The Game isn't that either. The big moral point at the end is just another cliché in the pit of clichés The Game already was. We got it back with A Christmas Carrol and It's a Wonderful Lifewhy did we sit through this tedious movie just to hear old news? Excuse the overused pun, but in every aspect The Game loses. It leaves the viewer feeling like they were just cheated in the same way the main character was, but not in the meaningful way. More in a ""I could have done the laundry in the time it took to watch that pointless movie!"" kind of way.<br/><br/>1/10"

","Michael Douglas plays steely-cold investment banker in San Francisco who gets a curious birthday gift from his ne'er-do-well brother: membership in a mysterious club which promises to enrich Douglas' existence. At first, the pranks are elaborate but silly, but eventually the icy businessman encounters blackmail, entrapment, attempts on his life, and finds himself quickly losing his cool. The film, stylish yet limited, only works if you accept Douglas' reactions--but I didn't believe it for a minute when he freaks out in a public place because his briefcase won't open. There are not so many 'errors' in the film as outright implausibilities, and Michael Douglas as an actor finds himself in quicksand, occasionally looking just as ridiculous as the plot. Director David Fincher is becoming rather predictable: once again, he gets the proceedings off to a sluggish start (with stilted introductions to his players) and doesn't follow through on promising ideas or with basic logic (as when Douglas finally calls the police about a break-in, yet the scene is left unresolved). The picture is frustrating, but not in the suspenseful sense. It should've been smarter. ** from ****"

"sddavis63","4","5","8","18 November 2010"," It's Completely Lacking In Credibility
","I like psychological suspense-thrillers. What makes them work really well is believability. No matter how outlandish the story may seem, there has to be at least a bit of your brain that's saying as you watch ""I could see that happening."" That's when you get drawn into the story. That's when suspense takes hold. That's when you begin to be able to feel the fear of the main characters. That's when a psychological suspense-thriller works really well. Unfortunately, ""The Game"" doesn't work really well. It doesn't do any of the above. It's simply not believable. Never once in the movie (or at least once we were introduced to the game that Nicholas Van Orten was playing) did I have the thought that ""I could see this happening."" Never. It was too outlandish. Think about it. In order for this game to work, pretty much the entire City of San Francisco would have had to have been onside. Van Orten could have done any number of things or (and here's the real problem) encountered any number of people who - not being in on the game - could have changed things completely. The game (to me at least) is unworkable; unplayable. Since that was my feeling right from the start, I didn't get pulled in by the story. I found it long and drawn out. The writers tried valiantly to keep me on my toes by throwing twists and turns and surprises - but I really didn't care, because I just didn't believe any of it. Too bad.<br/><br/>Too bad, because the cast was good and solid. Michael Douglas was in character, playing a fairly stereotypical character for him, as Nicholas Van Orten, and Sean Penn did well as his little brother Conrad, who presented Nicholas with the game as a birthday gift. I liked Deborah Unger as the ""waitress"" Christine. Honestly? She's attractive, but not the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, but she had a chemistry with Douglas, and she did present a real aura of sexiness, even though that wasn't particularly what the character was about (the ""I'm not wearing any underwear"" comment notwithstanding!) <br/><br/>The basic idea of a movie about a ""reality game"" (made in the era before ""reality TV"" became a staple) was interesting. If this had just been toned down a bit, and the scale of the game not been quite so large, it would have been more credible and therefore much more suspenseful and satisfying."

","Some movies have a distinct tone and rhythm, and you just get immersed in them, and it's that proverbial ""emotional rollercoaster."" These are the best movies, in my opinion. The Game is one of those. The music really helps with achieving that immersion.<br/><br/>In the end, it is hard not to go over the movie in your mind, consider if the plot holds together when you finally discover what is happening, and ultimately it does not entirely hold together, it has contrivances necessary to realize this story and requires you to suspend disbelief and/or not think too hard about the plausibility of some sequences. I mean, Forrest Gump made you suspend disbelief about a lot of stuff, but it was also a great movie.<br/><br/>If you consider folk tales, they are stories that have exaggerated or unrealistic or supernatural elements, so you must suspend disbelief somewhat to enjoy them. And we can and do suspend disbelief, and thus we can and do enjoy them. But some movies try to present a plausible reality, like a ""what if this really happened,"" and when THOSE movies cheat with obvious fake and contrived plot elements, it knocks us out of the story and makes for a bad movie. Well, I think the Game and Forrest Gump and Fight Club and some other movies along those lines (maybe the entire James Bond series) are sort of like modern folk tales... If you judge them against realistic dramas or thrillers, their contrivances will seem like a flaw. If you consider them like, say, a Paul Bunyan story, you don't immediately hate it because there's no such thing as a giant blue ox, right? The point is, the Game has contrivances, but only those needed to tell this very subtle and complex folk tale. (I realized Legend of Bagger Vance is probably another good example of this kind of movie.)<br/><br/>The great thing about the movie is that tells the story of a man who has all the material trappings of success, but he's basically a prisoner of his own life, having gotten unknowingly trapped into plodding along like an ox turning a millstone with no way to escape because his own mind is the trap. There's a deep truth here, that people get into their own ruts and opportunities to truly step out of our rut and change direction and gain a better perspective on life, are rare. You watch the movie, see the main character unhinged from his ordinary life to where he can have a transformative moment, and you maybe can have a little echo of that yourself, thinking about your own life, how you might be in a rut and not taking time to appreciate what really matters. That's a pretty big feat, and not many movies can do that.<br/><br/>I saw another reviewer who wrote the movie is good once, but has no re-watch potential, but I completely disagree, and have seen it at least 4-5 times."

"Leofwine_draca","9","3","4","20 July 2016"," Twisty-turny thriller makes for compelling viewing
","A thriller that is actually thrilling? A complex film which is actually easy to follow? Well, it doesn't happen very often, but occasionally a certain director can pull off a potentially baffling movie and turn it into something of a masterpiece. This is the case with THE GAME, a typically dark and mysterious, occasionally disturbing film from director David Fincher. It's very much in the style of Fincher's other films, so it might be a good idea to have some idea of what to expect with this one. Basically, nothing is what it seems and the whole perception of reality and normal life is subverted in THE GAME, which starts off with a typical businessman in a typically dull life and soon goes off in some very strange directions indeed. Okay, so it's mightily implausible and some parts just don't make sense when you think about them a lot, but this is a darn sight better than most contemporary thrillers which are content to rehash old ideas and styles. Yes, it's original, and yes, it's a cracker.<br/><br/>There is an almost constant stream of intense situations, puzzles, and little mysteries going on in this movie. There's always something odd or exciting going on which means that it holds the attention throughout, from the very beginning to the very ending. The acting is exceptional, with Michael Douglas perfectly cast as the hard businessman caught up in some very strange situations. Sean Penn also has a good, if small, role as his wacky brother. The supporting cast are uniformly excellent, as is the camera-work, music, everything. Everything is exactly right with this film. Watch out for the weird, yet brilliant moment when Douglas' television starts talking to him. You won't believe your eyes either. There are also about ten twist endings to enjoy before the credits roll. THE GAME is a compelling, twisting thriller which deserves to be see by everybody immediately. Required viewing for Fincher fans, this Hollywood thriller is more mind-bending than most."

","I had seen this movie at the theater when it came out in 1997, and decided to watch it again tonight (March 2012). I remembered that the movie ended with a birthday party and that the whole thing was fake and orchestrated by CRS the whole way through. Even so, while I was watching the movie again, a part of me couldn't help but believe CRS had actually missed finding the gun in Michael Douglas' house, and that he had actually killed his brother. I thought that perhaps I had remembered wrong and that the true ending was Michael Douglas committing suicide because he felt so bad about shooting his brother, and was depressed about being so lonely. Had the movie ended like that, I would still think it was a great movie because of the very powerful emotions the movie was trying to portray.<br/><br/>I have to admit the whole premise of putting your brother through all that as a ""birthday present"" is pretty perverse, but even having already seen the movie, I still thought it was gripping and brilliantly made. I'm sure that if you analyze the movie really closely, you will find some inconsistencies and situations that are completely implausible. But this was still thoroughly enjoyable: the big picture premise is truly mind-bending and impressively creative."

","Just watched this suspense thriller directed by David Fincher and starring Michael Douglas on HD DVD. Douglas is a broker in San Francisco who's about to have a birthday coming up. His brother Sean Penn gives him a present in the form of a possible membership in a company with the initials C.R.S. I'll stop there and just say that while things get unbelievably ridiculous, one gets curious anyway because of how one just wants see what they would do next. Fine supporting performances by Deborah Kara Unger as ""Christine"", Armin Mueller-Stahl, and James Rebhorn as someone connected with C.R.S. in more ways than one.

","This is definitely a roller-coaster film that never lets up, throwing nonstop intensity your way, continually remaining unpredictable and serving as the ultimate movie-going escapism. Michael Douglas turns in a likable performance as the perfect character to have so many things go wrong for him, and the dialogue and music craftily add to the suspense; the unnervingly high-pitched piano and deep string music never lets you forget this is a thriller. And the setup and progression of events are so enthralling that even if you don't approve of the outcome, getting there is all the fun. The idea is fascinating, and the way each of the events continues to draw Nick into a more and more complex fantasy is unique and endlessly amusing. His paranoia and uncertainty of what is happening interests us in the same way as if we were engaged in the game ourselves.<br/><br/>David Fincher has been making feature length movies since 1992 when he directed the third film in the Alien series. Since then, he's directed eight others, included GWTDT, and has another in pre-production. Fincher will turn 50 years old next year putting him in a generation of filmgoers who love movies like Easy Rider, The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Midnight Cowboy. These are great movies but they are for another generation, not necessarily the one that is targeted in films like Fight Club, or in The Social Network. Fincher has chosen to make movies for the generation following his own and he has captured the eyes of so many with a type of honesty and a type of gritty portrayal that we don't see from a lot of filmmakers targeting that same audience. The way Fincher's movie's look and a feel appeal more to that generation than any other is difficult to put into words but I'll do my best."

I would rather not discuss the plot with anyone because this movie is definitely an experience which some could argue come close to what the late Alferd Hitchcock would bring to us , all I can say that after watching you might love it loathe one thing is for certain and that is that won't ever be bored during the course of this journey. As good as Sean Penn is , this was without a shout of a doubt Micheal Douglas's movie , from the begin he just lures you in with his unique form of acting to the point where one actually begins to sympathises with him. There are classic Dave Fincher trademarks whether it be deliberately keeping things dark with plenty of twists and turns and not to mention a tight script. My only complaint was that the movie might just drag a little in places but having said that it never wonders far at all and the action and suspense is great. To conclude I had no idea what this movie would be like when I viewed it last night and I guess that was the trick of it all as we take the ride with Mr Van Orton !

","""The Game"" plays about as well in today's world as ""Let them eat cake"" did in Marie Antoinette's. I just can't bring myself to care about Michael Douglas's investment banker character who lacks nothing in the material world but apparently needs to have ungodly millions spent on him to open his eyes to life again. Poor guy. It also doesn't seem that Michael Douglas cares much about the character either, since there is nothing particularly engaging about his acting; on the other hand, to be fair, Michael Douglas pretty much never does anything except play Michael Douglas, so what can we really expect. Sean Penn is superb at being super annoying, but then we all know that's not really acting either. The premise is that friends or loved-ones pay a company to subject ultra high net worth clients to bizarrely complex, supremely dangerous, and highly improbable games in which they're pushed up to and beyond their physical and mental limits. It's supposed to be good for them. In reality, the various kinds of trauma this would produce would inevitably lead to huge lawsuits and significant jail time for the perpetrators. It didn't even look to be the slightest bit fun or spiritually enlightening as a movie, never mind in real life. I kept thinking that maybe this was all going to play out as some kind of supernatural horror story along the lines of ""Angel Heart"" (which was truly horrifying), but instead this plot was somehow supposed to be possible. You simply cannot suspend disbelief with this film. In reality, Michael Douglas would be dead 100 times over, so the fact that the story was somehow supposed to happen completely killed the whole experience for me. And finally coming back to the beginning of my review, this film was made in 1996. The world has changed a lot since then. The gap between the haves and have-nots is now a yawning chasm, and when you imagine the preposterous level of financing the company behind ""The Game"" would have required to ""awaken"" its super-spoiled clients, the whole theme of the movie doesn't play well today. It's like, ""Oh, you poor dear, you really had to make do with $10,000 a bottle wine. How did you ever survive?"" Especially after all of the twists were revealed at the bitter end, I was only left feeling that I couldn't have cared less if every character in the movie had died a violent, horrible death. All of these insufferables would have been ""friended"" by the guillotine not so long ago in history. Therefore, other than excellent production values, no other values of any kind in this movie. I really wish I hadn't fallen for the high rating on this movie, so I gave it one star rather than the two I'm more inclined towards in a futile effort to bring the rating down a little bit."

","Nicholas Van Orten is a billionaire who has forgotten how to enjoy himself, and how to connect with anyone else. An ex-wife with whom he has little or no contact, a younger prodigal brother, and memories of a father who took his own life are the only human points of contact in his orbit. Pretty poor fare, and his plight is hardly going to top anyone's sympathy list.<br/><br/>Fincher gives the whole thing high production values and a sinister sheen, adding pace and intrigue throughout. He makes excellent use of shadows and light, casting Van Orton's home is a particularly frosty hue. The story moves along briskly and economically, Van Orten fighting to retain control (his biggest fear being to lose control) of a situation that escalates rapidly in a series of adrenaline rushes. The sleek cars, expensive suits and chrome office buildings give way to Mexican dirt and dust and a bus ride with chickens. And that is the game just starting.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas may lack range, but he can match any actor alive in the sneering stakes. Sean Penn is a nice counterpoint, rash and unruly but somehow charming with it.<br/><br/>This isn't a film with a message (except for the inevitable thinly-disguised morality tale element Hollywood so often insists on), and you probably won't watch it twice.

","Like many of the prior comments here, I found this film engrossing and interesting, in terms of its presenting more intelligent fare than most of the offerings today, on large screen or small. Having recently seen it again, it is also a flick which is one of those as interesting on subsequent viewings as the first.<br/><br/>And aside from the excellent cast and performances, and with Michael Douglas, my personal favorite actor -- it managed to combine several genres at once, all of them better-presented than in films where only one would be involved.<br/><br/>Science fiction has always presented unexplainable and impossible features compared with ""real life."" Heck, 70 years ago, Buster Crabbe as ""Buck Rogers,"" along with his cohorts, was flying throughout the universe in a craft, large and well-equipped and -furnished, much like Kirk and Spock and the ""Star Wars"" denizens, everyone walking around freely as if they were in a fancy hotel suite. Yet even today, the ships and space stations remain cramped and less-than commodious.<br/><br/>Along with ""science fiction'"" (and containing many occurrences patently impossible, but somehow credible), this film also has characteristic of the horror genre, ""Poltergeist-""type occurrences; also the good old-fashion ""noir"" flick of the 40's and 50's (the reason why Brian Donlevey died with a healthy estate). It also has pure mystery elements, along with those of sophisticated drama, the ""main character (however powerful and rich)"" reordering his priorities and finding what's really important in life. It also provided some ""road film"" scenes, and plenty of danger for the lead character. <br/><br/>There probably are a few other categories, but these are sufficient to describe this outstanding picture, well-crafted, interesting, and one of those few capable of holding your interest throughout."
"alexx668","8","4","6","13 July 2008"," Game over
","What really sets ""The Game"" apart is the metaphysical undercurrent. As a mystery action-thriller, it's great, full of plot-twists and tension. As the game that central-character, Nicholas Van Orton, was offered unfolds, and prank after elaborate prank turns to deadly ambiguous reality, Nicholas loses control of his life but also finds himself as the traveler in a Danteesque hell.<br/><br/>The metaphysical meaning is this: the whole experience works as some sort of purgatory for Nicholas, who gets a chance to redeem himself of his sins (him being a ruthless capitalist businessman and alienated from pretty much everyone around him). At the start of the game, the mysterious organization company CRS (a sort of god, though in the end guided by the mere mortal players' wishes) evaluates Nicholas and his abilities, so that it organizes the perfect experience for him. At the apex of the game, and when Nicholas loses his money, he is being left for dead in a cemetery in Mexico. He metaphorically dies and is reborn a changed man.<br/><br/>The director, David Fincher (of ""Seven"" and ""Fight-Club"" fame) obviously had a ball filming this."

","Movie viewers usually enjoy it when a twist is thrown in at the end of the film. Perhaps Alfred Hitchcock deserves some credit for inventing the idea, and some might say it is the secret behind M. Night Shyamalan's success with movies such as the Sixth Sense. However, a twist at the end isn't necessarily always good. Sometimes it is little more than ridiculous. This is the case in The Game. The Game has all the hallmarks of a great movie. Suspense, action, dialogue, and great intensity as Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) tries to figure out what the hell is happening to him. Things get worse and worse for Van Orton (all the money is sucked out of his account and he is left for dead, and penniless in Mexico) and on his return to America he sets out to find who was behind the plot. It turns out that it was all a big hoax set up by Van Orton's brother to get him to enjoy life more. It is a clever idea, but one has to wonder if the ending was tacked on because the movie was getting too dark. The revelation at the end that everybody was acting, and the bullets shot at Van Orton in a few scenes were blanks (one has to wonder whether the script writers realised there was a major problem in that you actually see the bullets shattering glass, making holes in walls etc.) feels something like hearing a joke that builds up for 5 minutes and ends with a silly pun. Anyhow, this is a classic film, and who knows, some people may like the ending, but in my view the final explanation is so weak that it brings the rating down from a 9.5 to a 7."

","You would have thought that a thriller helmed by Hollywood darling David Fincher, whose resume includes Seven, and with a cast that includes Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and the wonderful Deborah Unger could not fail to deliver.<br/><br/>It does fail and there are two reasons why. One is the screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris. They obviously think that patronising the audience's intellect will somehow makes us believe we are witnessing a work of genius. The other is Fincher's preoccupation with style and visuals. Now there is nothing wrong with that per se but it should not be at the expense of content. With the benefit of hindsight I am sure the Producers could have engaged Tony Scott for half the price!<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, involves a birthday gift to millionaire businessman Douglas (resurrecting his Gordon Gekko role) from his seedy and disreputable (what else!) brother Penn (Carlito's Way?). The gift comprises an invitation to participate in a ""Game"" run by the mysterious Consumer Recreation Services company.<br/><br/>Once Douglas reluctantly joins the ""Game"" he is gradually drawn into a nightmare world where mishaps perpetrated against him become increasingly dangerous and violent. He desperately tries to retain control of events as his world falls apart.<br/><br/>I am sure the writers intended us  to be astounded by the cleverness of each new twist and gasp in awe at every predicament that befalls our hapless victim as we, the poor dumb audience, try to make sense of it before all is revealed. Unfortunately, we never stood a chance because the clues were never put there by the writers. All red herrings and no rosetta stone I'm afraid.<br/><br/>The problem is that by two thirds in to the film the events have become so laughably far-fetched and unbelievable that we no longer care what happens  to the beleaguered Douglas or why they are happening.<br/><br/> The denouement to the movie, when it comes, is so preposterous we almost want to believe the writers planned the whole thing as one big joke on the audience, sadly,  this movie is not as smart as they would have you believe.<br/><br/>It fails as a black comedy because it's neither dark enough nor funny enough and is simply too ridiculous to work as a thriller. Deborah Unger and character actor James Rebhorn try valiantly to inject some life and Douglas and Penn do what they do best, but ultimately it's an empty exercise. And if all this wasn't bad enough it's got a soundtrack that includes Jefferson Airplane!<br/><br/>Fincher has flirted with great filmmaking with the dark and bleak Severn and undoubtedly knows how to light a movie to create a foreboding and tense atmosphere. He adopts the same stylish visuals to good effect here but until he finds a script worthy of his style and talent the jury will remain out as to whether he really is one of Hollywood's great filmmakers.<br/><br/>I have no doubt this movie will do well because it is slick, glossy and pushes all the right buttons for an undemanding audience and at the end of the day that is what the studio executives want. More demanding audiences will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Verdict: Rent the Out of Towners with Jack Lemmon instead."

On his birthday, he receives a gift from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) who had a troubled past with addiction and mental imbalance. The gift is actually a life experience game designed specific for each individual based on their past and their thought process. Is it really a game? Is it an elaborate scam? Whether you like it or not, it is a Michael Douglas show from start to finish. It is an interesting concept to discuss it over a drink, but just does not seem feasible considering it is either not science fiction or fantasy. Once that is plotted in your mind, whatever happens on the screen just looked ridiculous for me and it is one of those thrillers where you want to get it over with rather than eager to see what happens at the end. Worst part was trying to getaway with a flat screenplay and editing that does not try to be either abstract or non-linear. At least that would keep the audience puzzled a bit.

","Nicholas Van Orton has everything - health, wealth, a nice house, and a general satisfaction with life. Life hasn't been easy for Nicholas - his father committed suicide and his wife left him, but he manages to get through smoothly. Smoothly until his eccentric brother comes to town and gives him an unusual birthday present - a ticket to a game. Now, whether Nicholas wants to be involved or not is irrelevant, because the game is already playing him...<br/><br/>This film draws a strange parallel to Bret Easton Ellis's novel ""American Psycho"" and also the film version which came out in 2000. Ellis told the story of a man who has everything and wants more and more to the point of obsession. ""The Game"" tells the story of a man who has everything, but frankly doesn't give a damn. Work is work, who cares. Nicholas Van Orton goes through the motions in way much like the notorious Patrick Bateman - up in the morning promptly, off to work, meeting, gym, lunch, phone calls, drive home, dinner, etc... Like a robot on autopilot. Nicholas Van Orton is annoyed by the slightest deviation from his finely tuned routine so the viewer can really see how much ""the Game"" is a hell for him.<br/><br/>Cleverly devised and continuously diverting until the end, the story is a brilliant and though provoking look at the worth of endless wealth. You can't do everything like Bateman tries, but you also can't do nothing like Van Orton tries. You have to do something. So why don't you? Go out and play. --- 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R despite minimal violence and limited profanity"

","I watched this based on having read many positive reviews. If I had read the negative reviews, I would probably have given it a miss. The main thread common to most all of the poor reviews is how things so quickly spin out of control with absurdity piled on absurdity, finally reaching an ending that ranks with the most ridiculous I have seen.<br/><br/>Things start out well enough with Michael Douglas playing the self-important, officious, extravagantly wealthy financier Nicholas Van Orton. Douglas carries this role off well, a talent he has shown in other movies. Things start to go wrong when Van Orton signs on to ""The Game"" with a company known as CRS. The game is presented as a mysterious life changing experience with no specifics offered. There is no way a person like Van Orton would have innocently agreed to the detailed interrogation he was subjected to at CRS in order to participate in some game. He would have sent out a fleet of lawyers and investigators to find out every last detail about this company before ever having anything to do with them.<br/><br/>Once Van Orton does sign up for the game, things only get more and more unbelievable. The intent is to have the audience guessing what is real and what is part of the game, but, if you are a realist, this hocus-pocus will cease to hold your interest. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger (who plays Douglas' main antagonist) try to stay serious in what is essentially a frippery. While on screen only briefly, Sean Penn plays Van Orton's brother with the appearance of having participated in this foolishness on a lark.<br/><br/>I give the movie credit for its high production values."

""Well, it's for free.""<br/><br/>What a waste of time! I was not as angry as I was when I left the movie theatre after seeing ""Seven"". Maybe because I expected a ridiculous story, a film only concerned with manipulating its viewers by using hollow effects, where a sledgehammer is a subtle tool compared to them. The director isn't interessted in his characters for a second, so why should we be. Maybe this film was about the changes in the personality of Michael Douglas character. But the director lost focus, seemingly more concered with the boring action sequences.<br/><br/>Yes, the film was boring. Mainly because I couldn't identify with any character, especially not with Michael Douglas' character. How dumb could this guy be? Using his bank passwords on the phone when one of the known ""enemies"" is sitting next to him? Even if not, telling the password on a cell phone? And how dumb did Fincher think his audience is: Maybe not everbody understood, what that burning price tag inside the lamp meant. But I guess everybody knew after he opened the empty fridge. Opening drawings, looking on bookshelves and turning photographs was really annoying.<br/><br/>If you like thrillers where the main character doesn't know who's on his side, don't bother with this flick.

","Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy, and very unlikeable, businessman who has every material comfort and pleasure money can buy. So, his younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), gives Nicholas an unusual gift for his 48th birthday: an invitation to play an elaborate and mysterious ""game"", from a mysterious corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).<br/><br/>It's an intriguing film concept; a cold-blooded corporate exec submits to a proposition that forces him to function as a puppet on a string. We can imagine all sorts of humiliating challenges that this reptilian man must confront, what great payback.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, although it's a great concept, the story is awful. Nicholas' challenges are too physical to be believable. Most of the middle Act consists of repetitive encounters that cause Nicholas physical pain and/or major financial and logistical trouble. Over and over we see him confront ludicrous obstacles that are so contrived and improbable as to be silly. The problem here is that the script is written as a souped-up action movie, evidently to appeal to kids. The film presents all of this revved-up action well. But, given that Nicholas does not invoke the supernatural or super human skills, the film's plot is totally inconsistent with reality. Plot holes are everywhere.<br/><br/>The film would have been far better with challenges that are more cerebral, more realistic. But, of course, that would have bored the intended audience. As is, ""The Game"" comes across as an animated cartoon, aimed at youngsters.<br/><br/>The film's cinematography, acting, and production design are fine. I am disappointed that Michael Douglas would agree to play the lead role in a film wherein the story is so implausible, so ""cartoonish""."

","It was entertaining, but the ending was totally obvious. Anyone shot in the chest is wearing a bullet proof vest in every movie. Hollywood formulas give away the fact that his ""jumping"" was not final - no music, no moment of questioning....as soon as I saw the glass too, it was quite obvious. Finally, who would be happy with that? they tortured him. Anyway, my real question is the very end, she invites him to coffee. If He gets in the cab with her (which they probably predicted he would) does that mean the game hasn't yet ended? Does it ever end? isn't life all a game? Everyone else seemed focus on the party being the end, but I was wondering what people thought about this encounter with ""Claire"" from ""Colorado"" (she did not sound very truthful even then)...she had probably been waiting out there until Sean Penn had a change to tell his brother she was waiting for him right? is it still a game?"

The writing, the atmosphere, the dialogue, the score, the cinematography and the brilliant performances are as close to perfection as you can get. One of the complaints I've heard about The Game is that the movie isn't realistic and goes too far. Well, today we have technology that is far more impressive than anything seen in The Game. I came to realize long ago that the world is usually a lot more complex than we realize and with money and an endless amount of resources you can get some pretty amazing things done. That being said, the goal of the movie was never to be realistic. It was rather to create an exciting ride into the realm of cinematic magic, a world where reality and fiction dance together as elegantly as possible.

When ""The Game"" starts, you are in a thriller ride of you lifetime. <br/><br/>Overall, ""The Game"" is a good as thriller can possible be.

"antonjsw1","Null","2","3","15 August 2015"," An intelligent, gripping drama, filmed with crisp efficiency
","A very solid, thoughtful and stylish outing from made with great precision that is becoming a hallmark of David Fincher. His interest in 'films that scar' continues, and while this film doesn't top quite the heights of the remarkable Se7en, it is still a very worthy achievement, thanks to a trenchant yet subtle performance from Michael Douglas. The script is solid, but it is really the effective partnership between Douglas and Fincher, as well as great supporting acting turns from Sean Penn, James Rebhorn and Debra Kara Unger, which really helps ground this slow burning but always engrossing psychological thriller. You have to pay attention, but as the plot twists and turns it does work its way to a satisfying if surprisingly climax (especially for a director of Fincher's background) you'll enjoy the way that Douglas's Nicholas Van Orton character is stripped of his layers of reserve and control as the character is cleverly placed in one crisis after another. <br/><br/>Technical credits are as usual very polished – production design and Haris Savidies's photography stand out, but its Howard Shore's minimalist score that really enhances the mood of the film brilliantly. While the score has some of the dark overtones of Se7en, it is not as dark as that movie but still works very well to make the viewer fell unsettled – in particular the use of a sole piano is extremely effective in certain scenes. To cap it all it is slickly edited and comes together with a crisp efficiency. Overall another film that firmly cements David Fincher's reputation as an extremely talented and uncompromising film-maker."

","In a dark, dangerous San Francisco lives Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas), a very rich businessman and a total loner. He doesn't come across as pathetic, but as rather as stern and cold, and blatantly unhappy despite the lap of luxury in which he lives. Sensing Nicholas' unhappiness, Nicholas' wild and über ostentatious brother Conrad (Sean Penn) appears and presents Nicholas a birthday gift, a gift that is sure to add some excitement to Nicholas life, and lift him out of the depressive fog that he carries around everywhere.<br/><br/>Along the way we learn some little bits of information about Nicholas' life, but not much, which is nice because his past doesn't really seem to matter anyway. Fincher takes the character and forces him to deal strictly with the present time. All past regrets, misdeeds, and sins fall away when you are literally fighting for your life.<br/><br/>Conrad's gift is a game. A set of real life, role-playing scenarios designed and executed by a company alleged called CRS. We don't know what CRS is, and neither does Nicholas, so when bizarre happenings start to occur, such as the nightly news anchor breaking character and speaking directly to Nicholas in his living room, Nicholas cannot tell what is really happening. Is this part of the game? Or am I hallucinating? Soon the puppet masters at CRS crank up the intensity of the events. There are numerous attempts on Nicholas' life. At one point he wakes up in Mexico after having been buried alive in an underground tomb. The occurrences are so extreme, that as an audience, we are just as confused as Nicholas. It is real? Or is it a game? It is impossible to tell, and this is what makes this film so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>The world that CRS tailors to its clients is very cool and well put together. Even though Nicholas is told distinctly that the CRS game will begin, and it is not until after he is told this that strange and dangerous things start to happen, we are still unsure if it's game or reality. Fincher is essentially blurring our understanding of the common philosophical conventions of cause and effect.<br/><br/>The Game is a good thriller, and an entertaining watch. The production value of the film is excellent. It projects on screen in dark, shadowy tones, mixed with diverse textures setting one scene to next to a another composed completely different. The film is full of interesting settings from Nicholas' mansion, to a Mexican border town, to meetings in coffee shops, to cabins in the woods, but despite the actual events taking place being very entertaining to watch, the film never really establishes what truth it is trying to convey. The ending is disappointing. We are not left with any kind of substantial meaning.<br/><br/>The CRS experience is meant to be a massive, over-the-top shock to the nervous system. This shock forces one, Nicholas in this case, to decide whether he wants to fight to stay alive, or let go and die. Maybe we are supposed to take the hint and choose to live now, even though we don't have CRS to break us out of our depression and lethargy, as individuals, or as a whole society. But this might be pushing the limits of interpretation. Despite the absence of the deeper themes, such as investigating the pointlessness of existence as in Fight Club, or the proving the worthlessness of humanity as in Seven, The Game is still great watch. Once the film ends, it doesn't linger for days in the front of your mind like the best thrillers, but while your watching it you'll be on the edge of your seat, never knowing what it going to happen next.<br/><br/>Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"

The movie is about Nicholas Van Orton ( Michael Douglas), a wealthy bank investor, who has everything. It's his 48th birthday, and it brings back memories from his childhood. His father was 48 when he committed suicide. My impression from watching the movie was, Van Orton, is afraid he would end up like his father.<br/><br/>When his brother Conrad comes to San Francisco, and hands him a Birthday card, he wonder what Conrad really wants. Conrad Van Orton ( Sean Penn) is the somewhat troubled younger brother. He has had a troubled past and Nick is wondering if Conrad might be in trouble again. Once Nick opens the card he sees this invitation to CRS, Community Recreational Services. A place where people can go for a GAME. Conrad explained that he used their services in Europe; and the experience was incredible.<br/><br/>Nicholas ponders on this and decides to go to CRS. Once there he takes a physical, psychological, and visual exams. He believes it's a waste of time; but he is just new to it. The next day he gets the call from CRS saying his application is deigned. He thinks it's no big deal and goes home, once he is through the gate of his house he sees this plastic clown. He brings it in and does a WTF. He decides it's a joke and goes on with his evening. He is sitting down; and watching this type of Finance Channel. He discovers that his game is beginning, he gets instructions about CRS and realizes he will be getting several keys; and it's up to him to discover when to use them. This movie is a roller coaster of fun. It takes Nicholas from his boring rich life to a life of excitement, suspense, and thrills. It's what his life is missing and that is what Nicholas Van Orton's game is. Near the end it is almost too much for him, because he is unaware that it's just a game. His game puts excitement in his life, but it comes close to taking him over the edge.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, too bad there is no such place that can give you something your life is lacking. I don't understand why I have seen some negative reviews unless it's because some didn't understand the plot. All in all this is a great movie, to those who haven't seen it you will not be disappointed. It's one of the best movies I have seen Michael Douglas in, so check it out.

","I don't know how accurate this is gonna be as I saw this movie 4 to 5 years ago. The only reason I am going to write a review for this is that I have only recently started writing reviews.<br/><br/>The very fact that I want to review this movie is a good indication of how much I liked it at the time. This movie as gripping as they come. Its a very intriguing tale of a birthday gift, very unique in its nature, from a younger brother, who his elder brother feels is a failure in life, to his elder brother, for whom success in the world is the only thing he wants, and who has spent his life chasing these worldly goals, and has forgotten to live. This gift will take him on a roller coaster ride for sure, but the end of the game, is not known and very surprising.<br/><br/>I felt the relationship between two brothers has been brilliantly portrayed in the script, and in the thrill a minute ride the movie is, this well portrayed relationship between the two brothers at two different ends of life is what elevates this movie from being just any thrill a movie, to being one of the truly memorable ones.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away anything so will keep it as spoiler free as possible. So I will suffice it to say that the twists never stop coming, and even when you get to a point in the movie where you are sure that one particular twist must be the last, you get another one 5 minutes later. Also the twists are not the hollywoodised twists, which are there in a movie just for the sake of it. No, it is one of the most cleverly written plots ever in a movie, and easily (for me) David Fincher's finest hour.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas and Sean Penn (whose role could have been a little longer) absolutely nail their characters, and when the movie is done, Mr. Nicholas Van Orton is a name you will never forget. <br/><br/>Its is must for you if you like intelligent thrillers that keep you guessing."
"The-Sarkologist","8","2","3","16 February 2012"," This movie will mess with your head
","This is what I would call a movie that messes with your mind and is one where I will not mention the ending because it will give away too much. Anyway, it is the 48th birthday of very rich investment banker named Nicholas Van Orten (Micheal Douglas). On this birthday his brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) gives him a ticket to this game, but Nick is not really that interested, but gives it a go anyway and suddenly discovers that his life has been turned upside down. Throughout the movie one is not sure whether it is really just a game or some very elaborate plot.<br/><br/>Nicholas Van Orten is an incredibly anti-social person. Right at the beginning of the movie one notices that he just does not want company. He is given an option of all these social events and rejects the lot of them. He just hates socialising, though he does cancel things for his brother. Nick is a very serious man who just doesn't find that fun is all that important. One of this things that adds to his personality is the fact that his father committed suicide on his 48th birthday. There was no reason for his father to suicide but he did.<br/><br/>The game starts with an intense psychological test where they probe every part of his personality and then give him tasks that are truly challenging. Unfortunately I cannot give too much of this away because it will spoil the movie and remove the mind messing aspect of it. It is an incredibly good movie and I enjoyed it because I did not know how it was going to end."

","The first act of The Game (the first 30min) were immaculate. The plot set-up was perfect, characterisation was sublime, it was a textbook screenplay. And from this moment on, I was hooked. The deviation from normality following this immensely realistic opening created an amazing contrast that set the tone of the film.<br/><br/>The plot twists come and go, and you never really know what is going to happen - the guessing game is expertly crafted both by Fincher in his direction, as well as John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris in their screenplay.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas was faced with the task of holding this film upon his shoulders, as it was essentially a one-man show, and he was amazing. His fraying emotions heightened his downward spiral and altered viewer perceptions of the character as a result. Sean Penn was very good as Conrad, the brother, as is Deborah Kara Unger, as the ever mysterious Christine.<br/><br/>Fincher's direction only cements his position as one of the greatest directors of modern day (our generation, if you will). Along with Se7en and Fight Club, his films are cult legends and The Game doesn't let you down one bit."

","This film is exceptionally one of David Fincher's best film. I enjoyed Fight Club, Se7en, and Panic Room (for the script). This should be considered one of his trademark film. You either like it or something else. The shots and the score all fit to the necessary atmosphere and script. Michael Douglas once again give a great portrayal of a man tortured mentally. The gradually rising tensity and some major twist leave the audience blank, for they know not what is going to happen. And we all love him for it. You are not there only to spy on the party. You are IN the party. And the family-video title sequence give me one of the best first impression I haven't seen in a long time.<br/><br/>This is a really good film from one of the finest director of our time. 9/10."

"The-Social-Introvert","8","1","1","21 January 2016"," Quickie Review: The Game
","It's been some years since I've seen The Game. I remember enjoying it very much so. Despite being a step down from his previous film, David Fincher's second outing in urban thriller-mode feels like something of a taut modern classic. A neo-Hitchcock movie if I ever saw one.<br/><br/>The film follows a dull and greedy investment banker who is given a card as a birthday present by his brother, who tells him to phone up the company whose expertise lies in some form of enigmatic character building game. Despite phoning up and attending an arranged test he is told he did not qualify. However, after this our protagonist finds some truly odd thing occurring in his life. Are these events real, or are they a part of 'the game'? What follows is an engrossing roller coaster ride with enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat during the course of its runtime. You never really know what's coming next. <br/><br/>Douglas and Penn as brothers are on form in a film I'd recommend to anyone. It's a fun movie for a Saturday evening, but not one that assumes its audience are idiots. Quite the opposite, in fact. If I had any complaints about the film it would be the ending which, for a movie that was pretty believable for the most part, required a lot of suspension of disbelief<br/><br/>Best Scene: Like I said it's been sometime since I've seen it. One part still remains in my mind, however – Douglas is visited by a frantic Penn begging him to forget everything about the game. It's a real um, game-changer in the film because it was the scene that cemented the realisation that ""Oh, hang on. Things are serious here."" (Or so I thought.)"
"StevePulaski","8","1","1","11 May 2013"," Ridin' the game out
","Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called ""the game,"" which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life.<br/><br/>After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for ""the game,"" he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that ""the game"" itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious.<br/><br/>Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice.<br/><br/>Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one.<br/><br/>""The Game"" in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to ""live"" or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years.<br/><br/>Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well.<br/><br/>Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher."

","'The Game', directed by the legendary David Fincher, is A Well-Made Film, that grabs your attention, thanks to it's terrific story-line, that is innovative, escapist & yet, arresting. The only glitch, comes in it's culmination, which left me in mixed emotions.<br/><br/>'The Game' tells the story of an investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.<br/><br/>'The Game' begins fabulously and grabs your attention from the very start. The Writing, in the first-hour, especially, is so engrossing & captivating, that it hardly gives you a chance to move your eyes from the Screen. The second-hour is interesting as well, but I thought the culmination, was plain average. The Screenplay by John Brancato & Michael Ferris is very good, but they definitely could've come up with a better end. <br/><br/>David Fincher directs this Psychological thriller, remarkably. His work, in each and every scene, is praise-worthy. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is sharp. Art Design is passable.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Michael Douglas pitches in an incredible performance. The Highly-Talented Actor plays the participant, with utmost conviction & understanding. Sean Penn is excellent as his brother. Deborah Kara Unger is decent. James Rebhorn & Armin Mueller-Stahl lend good support. <br/><br/>On the whole, An Interesting Watch, that to a large-extend, stands out."

This movie also ranks number 44 on the 100 scariest movie moments of all time, and ""The Game"" is not even a horror movie.

","I was surprised, after reading some of the comments, how much most everybody thought this movie through when all the confusion was over. It made me happy to think that a lot of people are still capable of absorbing material without blindly accepting it. We all aren't completely mindless fools yet. This is somewhat encouraging, keeping in mind how American education (among others) has been steadily dumbing down over the years. I read that the average vocabulary of a 14 year old has decreased by something like 4 times from what it was about 50 years ago. Anyway about the movie....it was quite suspenseful to my 16 year old mind which hasn't seen many of the movies of the past with similar approaches and tricks. I liked all the little plot twists and the acting was excellent. However, in my opinion, this was a movie, that one can pick apart in terms of realness and believeablility, what with all the simultaneous occurances and split second decisions that somehow coincide with something else that is suppose to happen. Basically, in real life the whole concept behind ""the game"" would be a very hard one to achieve......too many things could go wrong. This doesn't bother me too much though because I have always thought that movies' main purposes are to entertain and provoke thought, and THE GAME reached great success in both of these areas.<br/><br/>

"liakos","4","6","15","13 August 1999"," A typically modern ""unwise"" story,a ""temporary"" movie.
","The biggest of  Game's mistakes is its self-undermining storyline.When viewing it for the first time, it is true that a process of intense identification with the Michael Douglas character develops since we cannot but ""live"" his nightmare -although he is presented as an unsympathetic character.However this identification is violently dissolved by the end of the film-which I will not reveal for obvious reasons. The greatest predicament for the picture appears when put under a second viewing;there,identification-free,the viewer finds himself critically distanced from the character's misfortunes (since the ending is so sadly revealing and demythologising)and unhappily put in the position of a cynical observer of a man's adversities without feeling the slightest emotions of sympathy.This definitely presents a problem for a suspense-mystery film that the creator intends. Apart from this failure ,or should I say in addition ,the inadequate script offers minimum evidence of the ""hero""'s redemption and remorse - which are obviously at the core of the narrator's intentions-let us not forget Fincher's obsession with the Christian (or to be more accurate Apocalyptical)philosophical doctrine. The question this film poses, I feel is rather alarming:Why do contemporary filmakers(and it's a pity Fincher,whose Seven is truly one of the finest moments  of the decade,awakened this problematic issue),show such indifference to their art's lasting potential? The Game is a movie that could have been better - or even great;its handling ,nevertheless,both by its director but especially by its screenwriters relieves it from that opportunity and condemns it sooner than any of them anticipated."

So it's his birthday, and his brother proposes, ""What do you get your brother for his birthday when he already has everything he could possibly have in the entire world?"" Well, it turns out, you buy him a real life action sequence set up as a game, that the receiver of the gift, played by Douglas, will never know when his game starts, and won't know when it will end until that exact moment.<br/><br/>For the next hour after the game begins we, as the viewers, are taken on a long journey filled with on-foot and car chases, shootouts, kidnapping, explosions, and other clichÃ© and typical action sequences.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the action is so ridiculously over the top, that it can only be seen as a plot hole, bad writing even. Because the organizers of the game destroy cars, structures, entire houses, create explosions, fire assault automatic rifles off in the middle of downtown L.A. with no police repercussions for any of this. Suspending disbelief is just too impossible for this level of activity being unnoticed by local authorities. Not to mention many of the actors in the game impersonate federal, state and local law enforcement, and EMTs, all felonious acts.<br/><br/>Not to pigeonhole the movie into the 'all action no substance' genre that Hollywood is often accused of, the movie creates some horribly written dialog that is melodramatic, philosophical, and preachy. Not qualities that are fitting for an action-thriller movie, and serve to mostly get in the way of the explosions.<br/><br/>The cinematography, audio post production, and especially the acting, are all brilliant. The plot, and writing, and editing however are amateur at best and take away from the positives significantly.<br/><br/>Though the idea of this film is extremely original, the premise takes much creative license with reality and runs wild with an absurdly furious and unrealistic pace that would never go unnoticed by proper authorities. Everything that happens in the movie is part of 'the game' that the main character is experiencing. Factor in a $50 million budget then, and you have to wonder how his drug addicted, jobless, impecunious, and unkempt brother could have possibly afforded to pay for this birthday present. Throw in the fact that the company that runs that game would have to insure every aspect of the game that brings the total of the cost of one play-through of the game into the $100 million range. I just can't suspend disbelief that much for a movie that ignored its plot-holes to get straight to the explosions."

It starts off well, with visually pleasing establishing shots of the world our protagonist lives in, but scene after scene it looks less organic and more off-putting. One could say it's a purposeful act that's meant to enhance the feeling of the inorganic nature of the realm we're observing. I'm not talking about that kind of ""off-putting"". It just looks ugly.<br/><br/>For most people, the glaring issue of the film lies in its hardly-believable plot, and the absurdity of the idea that Douglas' actions could be anticipated to the last detail, as well as the fact his character never really does something off-beat to disrupt the CRS. This can all be ignored if we view the film as mindless entertainment, but it takes itself far more seriously than that to let it get away with that excuse.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is described as dark, yet it feels comical, and the viewer is left unable to fully process the weight and severity of what's happening.<br/><br/>The really big issue this movie has it it fails to be everything it's supposed to. For it to be an entertaining movie of the mystery genre, the game Douglas is playing would have to be entertaining. It's not.
We see him get overwhelmed with absurd situations, that fail to create tension and entice us, instead generating sheer frustration for the viewer. After a while it just makes you indifferent to his plight, and rather than craving resolution, you wish for it to end.<br/><br/>On the other hand, for the film to be a compelling mystery drama, there needs to exist character progression in order to justify layers upon layers of mystery. The protagonist is supposed to be shown experiencing growth and change based on the situations he finds himself in. Bluntly said, he's supposed to come out of the game being a better person, at least that's what the supposed point of the movie is. We never really get to see the effect of ""The game"", not even after the grand finale, and certainly not throughout the movie. We're just supposed to take it at face value that he's a different, better person now.<br/><br/>This is hard thing to accept, as it robs the audience of a certain kind of reward of growth and resolution.<br/><br/>To sum it up, The Game fails as entertainment, mystery and character study."

","Yeah it got me going for a little while there, thought this one was nicely building to one of those movies that plays deftly with the mind of both protagonist and viewer. A lot of you guys were fooled too considering the rating - this thing averages near 8/10, are you serious?<br/><br/>Boy oh boy that ending... I don't ever remember an ending of a film so badly souring everything that's gone before. Wicker Man & the first ""It"" adaptation come close... ""It"" disappoints while ""Wicker Man"" through laziness ruins everything that comes before (and the dumb ones in the audience think it's being clever). <br/><br/>But this ending takes the cake. So they knew exactly how this guy would react, in a moment of extreme emotional torment, because humans are so predictable at the best of times, let alone under extreme emotional duress. They knew he would shoot, they knew he would jump. <br/><br/>They knew precisely what part of the building ledge he would jump off, to the point they could plan where to put the big canopy to catch him. The ledge was a pretty wide ledge, had to be dozens of feet on one side, dozens on the other, but hey, they knew exactly what part he'd jump off. They trusted that he would land like a pro stunt man, on his back, not on his head, which would still have broken his neck, soft landing pad or no.<br/><br/>And, um, the company doing all this... what the heck do they charge? The budget for this kind of ridiculous service would be many millions, so you're saying a skeptical Michael Douglas agreed to pay this before knowing what he was getting? And the company wasn't worried about being sued by a rich client if something went wrong, which, with this absurd set up and the risks involved, easily could have?<br/><br/>Michael Douglas was good, which shouldn't surprise since he's playing more or less the same character he's played in nearly every film, the unsmiling corporate head honcho type. I gave it an extra star for that.<br/><br/> This could have been a good movie if they had been willing to come to a different conclusion somehow, maybe something a bit more metaphysical, but then you might have confused a few of the stupider viewers, and as we can all see, those outnumber the rest of us.

The story, about a man caught up in a deadly game apparently run by a big-bucks San Francisco company, makes no sense at all.  Spirited performances by the cast can't make up for plot holes big enough to coast a Mack truck through, and the finale is almost comical.

The concept is interesting but the script falls a mile short, forcing the audience to let its intelligence to be insulted for 2 hours.<br/><br/>There are so many mistakes and implausibilities in the movie, I'm sure I didn't even notice them all. But the most obvious: the timing of all of Douglas' encounters, the inability of the cops to do anything, Douglas' constant stupidity, and the fact that Douglas could have easily been killed on a few occasions.<br/><br/>Even the ending is very Sliver-ish, because they backed themselves into a corner.  Not to ruin the ending for anyone, but there are only 2 possible endings, and so both are predictable - is everything real or is everything just a game?  Does the audience care??  I say no.  Because either way it is completely unbelievable.<br/><br/>I highly recommend that you avoid this movie if you have half a brain, unless you want to see how NOT to make a suspense movie.

I feel that the whole movie had such a complex storyline for the sake of it due to the fact no satisfaction was aroused in my mind as the story progressed.

"kira02bit","2","4","10","2 June 2015"," Interesting concept that becomes preposterous and dumb
","Director David Fincher has developed legions of fans that praise his every move and now try to go backwards and rehabilitate his mistakes. Fincher truthfully is an uneven filmmaker. For every Seven, The Social Network and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, you have the indefensible Alien 3 and this little ditty, The Game.<br/><br/>The Game starts out well enough. Millionaire businessman Michael Douglas is given a gift for his birthday from ne'er-do-well brother Sean Penn to participate in an enigmatic game. Out of sheer curiosity, he investigates and is put through a battery of physical and psychological tests, before being told he does not qualify, which miffs him a bit. Then strange things begin to occur. Weird gifts show up, Douglas becomes certain that he is being watched/followed, and attempts are ultimately made on his life. He initially thinks it is ""the game"" but as the stakes rise he comes to believe something more sinister is at work.<br/><br/>Fincher provides his trademark dark brooding tone. The Game has a nice set-up and there is a fascinating idea at the core of the film, but it begins to fall apart in the execution by the one-third mark. It also requires us to suspend our belief and then brings out a jackhammer to shatter that suspension. As a result, it becomes increasingly foolish and stupid as it progresses, until it reaches an out-of-left-field climax that is not just preposterous, but requires the viewer to remove their brain completely and have Fincher stomp on it.<br/><br/>Douglas is not the most sympathetic or emotive of actors in the best of circumstances. Even in his Oscar-winning role of Gordon Gekko, he is basically an icy individual. Here is no different. Douglas should elicit our sympathy fairly quickly, but his central character is often so distant and aloof that it becomes difficult to care for him at all. Penn is unlikely cast in a glorified cameo as his brother (wouldn't you have loved to see their parents?). He brings nothing to the film. The remainder of the supporting cast is fairly irrelevant.<br/><br/>Prior to the big reveal at the end, the film has already evolved into a preposterous series of attempts to terrorize the main character. When the end comes and the big reveal is laid out and then the central character gets to react to them, your jaw drops to the floor because in no possible way could this have unfolded. Any attempts at realism have been slaughtered and left by the way-side. We have watched Douglas for a lengthy period of time be chased, terrorized, have his life placed in danger, driven into the ocean, made to think he has had his millions stolen and left a pauper, bamboozled by friends, acquaintances and family, worked up into hysteria, made to believe he has murdered his brother, and then driven to such extremes that he attempts suicide by jumping off a building...only to find that everyone has been in cahoots to convince him to enjoy life and stop and smell the roses! Huh? The film hits a new realm of idiocy in the sequence where Douglas takes his swan dive off the roof of a building and miraculously lands in air bags right outside of a swank dinner party for his birthday where all his family, friends and the people responsible for terrorizing him sit with champagne glasses in hand to welcome him. Miraculously, Douglas' response is not to hold everyone accountable for what he has been through, but to laugh it off, thank them all profusely and then try to pick up the femme fatale that the game's agency has had leading him on a merry chase. This is a shaggy dog twist that even M. Night Shyamalan would not touch. This is a real time-consuming mess and it is inconceivable that it has the high rating on IMDb that it does."

I really wish I didn't. This is a movie that is not very interesting and runs at a slow pace. Michael Douglas DOES do a good job acting it's just the character wasn't very interesting. Another thing I am a big fan of in David Fincher films are the legendary plot twists. I mean the ones is Seven and Fight Club are genius. But this one is somewhat predictable and keeps changing as if it can't make up it's mind. Basically it's just not smart and edgy like Fincher's other films. But hey everybody has a bad film.

The mysteries come one after the other with little if any explanation as to *why* stuff happens. We are meant to be thrilled by each tidbit on its own. <br/><br/>The one all-encompassing explanation comes at the end -- but we are expected to believe the many near-misses we experienced were all part of the design of the game.

So many people could easily have died in this one that it is really just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Sean Penn is one of the finest actors currently working in the USA and he is sadly under-used here.

But there was something about it that really didn't appeal to me.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas seemed bored in his role, proving that he can't really cut it any longer as the lead male in an action thriller.  All the other characters were hollow and one-dimensinal, the female sort-of love interest being a noteable offender.  The film never really seemed to know where it was going, and it never had the sense of urgency to it that thrillers are meant to have.  <br/><br/>All in all, there were some nice ideas and sub-plots that, if followed up, could have led to a much more entertaining film.

His life is in such an order, anything that is hard to control has been kicked out such as love and feelings. But if you look at his whole life, he had the most out of control life because his dad committed suicide. It is the most uncontrollable thing in life, which probably made him a controlling freak without awareness. CRS tried very hard to shake his life by making him lose his face, money, house, even identity. But none of them worked, he was very rational and was always able to put himself together and push it back to origin. Until he ""killed"" his brother which he used to despise but deeply loved.

","What do you get when you blend the narrative structure of ""The Usual Suspects"" with Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances, and the moral universe of Anton Chekhov's short story ""The Bet""? You get this finely crafted thriller directed by David Fincher (Alien3 and Seven) and starring Michael Douglas (Falling Down, The American President).<br/><br/>Michael Douglas plays a wealthy investment broker who appears to have it all. For his 48th birthday, his younger brother (well-played by Sean Penn) gives him a gift designed for the man who has everything-a membership in a recreational services club that custom-designs experiences to meet the unique voids of each individual client (or so they say). The catch is that clients never know what's coming, and the line between real life and ""the game"" gets more and more blurred as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>The movie pushes credibility to the limits, and occasionally, beyond. But the story is engaging enough that I found myself restraining my disbelief until after the ride was over. One of the things that can make this an enjoyable movie-going experience is taking some friends along who like to probe deeper meanings.<br/><br/>""The Game"" works not only as an engaging thriller, but also as a moral parable, a social commentary on the hollowness of contemporary society, and a kind of philosophical riddle. Viktor Frankl has described the illness of modern humanity as noogenic neurosis-an existential vacuum in the soul-that leaves us longing for deeper meaning. While ""The Game"" does not offer profound solutions, it does provide an engaging story about the problem."

","If you're like me...<br/><br/>Go into this movie expecting a bit of fun and not too much more than that, hence my 6/10 rating. The movie starts well and creates a lot of intrigue to the possibilities of what ""The Game"" might be. Though the whole time I was wondering if it could live up to the hype - that would be what decides the fate of the movie, is it going to be an ever unravelling puzzle which never really gets solved?<br/><br/>The puzzle will be solved, though it's certainly nonsensical and to be taken light heartedly. Don't worry about trying to take this movie too seriously, as you'll be disappointed with whether certain things are all that realistic. You have to get beyond that and imagine that it's plausible. <br/><br/>If you like David Fincher, expect the usual suspense, mystery and thrill that surrounds his movies, but not to the same high class. That's down to the plot rather than any fault of Fincher's. I don't think the movie (written how it is) has as much potential as Se7en, Gone Girl, Fight Club, even though at the start you would maybe think he could be onto another real hit. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas is well cast as the middle aged wealthy hotshot banker who goes through life without much spontaneity and fun, so his brother (Sean Penn) decides to get him involved in ""The Game"" to spice things up. Penn isn't in the film too much, so not necessarily one to watch just because you're a Penn fan, though the parts where we do see him, he's very typically emotionally Penn. That's a good standard as usual, but nothing new or lengthy here.<br/><br/>What stops this movie being great? It's certainly not down to acting or direction, in my eyes just the over elaborate plot which could've done a couple of things differently, so that in the end it all made sense. It's the ""that could never happen"" factor which stops it being great. It was possible to keep the plot along the same lines, with the same outcomes, but with different details in between. They instead chose a route which was implausible. That was the downfall unfortunately.<br/><br/>Still, I didn't mind enough to dislike it. I was especially intrigued at the start, and you do want to see where they go with the story. You want to find out what ""The Game"" is.<br/><br/>It's not one that i'll be revisiting anytime soon, but i'm glad I gave it a go. Have fun."

Plot: Numerous unexpectable and intelligent twists, especially at the end, in combination with a lack of information that is well placed throughout almost the entire movie create a suspenseful and exciting atmosphere. This plot, in which I see the excellence in this movie, has all it needs: a philosophic topic that can be found in the raised question of whether we are capable of knowing whats real and whats not; the protagonist's great motivation and desire to comprehend his surroundings and to survive; and last but not least: the high amount of absolutely great twists that keep the unpredictability steady. <br/><br/>2. Acting: I personally was very impressed by Sean Penn's performance that in the end effect brilliantly conveyed his characters motivation in a very subtle way. Douglas delivered a very authentic performance as well, but is not to be especially mentioned in my eyes, even though I would be incapable of spontaneously criticizing his acting in this movie. Furthermore Armin Mueller-Stahl brilliantly portrayed Anson Bear, the co-founder of Bear-Grant Publishing, who is soon to be made redundant. <br/><br/>3. Direction: One just has to hear the name David Fincher and it is clear that this movie is beautifully shot, absolutely aesthetic and simply outstanding concerning the direction. Once more David Fincher's sense for symmetry, beauteous colors and timing made a movie nicer to watch (at this point: thank you, Sir!). <br/><br/>My standpoint is that these are the things to mainly mention about this movie. There is neither an outstanding score, nor genius editing etc.. It is legit and solid, but not superb. On the other hand there is a great plot, along with a brilliant direction and nice performances that compensate these aspects and even make it one of the most intelligent and suspenseful movies I've seen so far. <br/><br/>Conclusion: The Game is an incredibly well made, thoughtful and intelligent thriller."

Far fetch may be the solution but you have to admire these filmmakers' desperate attempt to force feed us with this plot about a rich person's morality game. Michael Douglas tries in vain to convince us that he is a cold ruthless financial head, rolling in money and ego, (WALL STREET all over again?). But his little brother, Conrad, (Sean Penn in another manic performance), sets him up for a gift he'll never forget. Director, Fincer, uses his technical craft to enhance the thrills but if you're quick, you'll work out the ending fifteen minutes into the film."

I wasn't able to believe that what happened to Van Orton was serious. So I laughed a lot but wasn't really touched by the story. It was all to much: the big house with the man all by himself. The videofilms of his youth which I didn't found logical. No, even the game I didn't believe. Maybe that's the reason why I laughed so much. I don't think that other people can always know how a person will react in a certain situation, even after 2-day-psychological tests.

","For the first two hours of this movie, I absolutely loved it.  The sheer scope of the plot against Michael Douglas was amazing.  It was well-acted, well-plotted and excellently directed by Fincher.<br/><br/>Then came the ending (warning: there is a spoiler coming up).<br/><br/>I have never seen a lamer ending to any film in my life.  The fact that Sean Penn would put his own brother through such an ordeal is beyond me. Douglas was driven to the point that he was going to take his own life; you can't just shake that off in five minutes when you learn that it was all a big joke.  What if the elaborate ending had gone wrong, huh?  What if Michael Douglas, when he jumped from the building, had happened to miss the atrium and fell thirty stories onto the pavement?  Ol'Sean wouldn't have had such a good time then, eh?<br/><br/>Fincher usually ends his movies with a flourish.  ""Seven"" had a marvelous finale.  ""Fight Club,"" although a flawed film, at least had an interesting conclusion to it.  But this?  The Game is a terrific movie sabotaged by an awful ending."
"Pythius","6","2","4","22 September 1998"," Stylish but flawed
","Stylishly directed by David Fincher in a very convincing modern-day film noir mode. Plot is genuinely intriguing but takes a long time to gain any momentum at all. Ending is a real let-down particularly when an obvious window was there for a more intriguing and intelligent conclusion, although I suspect that popular tastes are the cause of this problem. Penn and Unger are good but Douglas as the lead character gives a rather lackluster performance that could easily have been put together from bytes from his other films."

Once you accept that, it's a lot of fun to just go along with this film.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, the first half (and maybe a bit more) isn't the best. Becuase there's apparently only so much you can do with the premise of an alternate reality game gone too far, it becomes pretty repetitive very quickly. However, once Michael Douglass wakes up in Mexico, the film picks up again and becomes better than ever.<br/><br/>It's not one of David Fincher's best movies (in fact, I would say it's his weakest film, not counting Alien 3), but his direction is so good and the thrid act so bonkers that I have to reccomend it."

","The opening scenes of ""The Game'' show Michael Douglas as a rich man in obsessive control of his life. The movie seems to be about how he is reduced to humility and humanity--or maybe that's just a trick on him. The movie is like a control freak's worst nightmare. The Douglas character, named Nicholas Van Orton, is surrounded by employees who are almost paralyzed by his rigid demands on them. ""I have an Elizabeth on line three,'' says one secretary, and then a second later adds, ""Your wife, sir.'' ""I know,'' he says coldly. We have the feeling that if the second secretary had not spoken, he would have replied, ""Elizabeth who?'' His underlings are in no-win situations. It is, in fact, his ex-wife; at age 48, Van Orton lives alone in the vast mansion where his father committed suicide at the same age. His birthday evening consists of eating a cheeseburger served on a silver tray and watching CNN.<br/><br/>Van Orton's younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn) visits him and announces a birthday present: ""The Game,'' which is ""sort of an experiential Book of the Month Club.'' Operated by a shadowy outfit named Consumer Recreation Services, the Game never quite declares its rules or objectives, but soon Van Orton finds himself in its grasp, and his orderly life has become unmanageable. ""It will make your life fun again,'' he is promised, but that's not quite how he sees it, as a functionary (James Rebhorn) leads him through the signup process.<br/><br/>Soon everything starts to fall apart. His pen leaks. His briefcase won't open. Wine is spilled on him in a restaurant. He is trapped in an elevator. The level of chaos rises. He finds himself blackmailed, his bank accounts are emptied, he wanders like a homeless man, he is trapped inside a cab sinking in a bay, he is left for dead in Mexico.<br/><br/>Of course many of the physical details of what happens to him are implausible or even impossible, but so what? The events are believable in the sense that events can be believed in a nightmare: You can hardly worry about how a horror has been engineered when you're trapped inside it.<br/><br/>The mounting campaign of conspiratorial persecution is greeted by Van Orton with his usual style of cold contempt and detachment: He knows all the angles, he thinks, and has foreseen all the pitfalls, and can predict all the permutations. But he finds he is totally wrong. Even those few people he thinks he can trust (including a waitress played by Deborah Kara Unger--or is she a waitress?) may be double agents. There is even the possibility that the Game is a front for a well-planned conspiracy to steal his millions. Michael Douglas, who is superb at playing men of power (remember his Oscar-winning turn as Gordon Gekko in ""Wall Street"") is reduced to a stumbling, desperate man on the run (remember his unemployed engineer in ""Falling Down"").<br/><br/>""The Game,'' written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, is David Fincher's first film since ""Seven,"" and projects the same sense of events being controlled by invisible manipulation. This time, though, there's an additional element: Van Orton is being broken down and reassembled like the victim of some cosmic EST program. And it is unclear, to him and to us, whether the Game is on the level of a fraud, or perhaps spinning out of control.<br/><br/>The movie's thriller elements are given an additional gloss by the skill of the technical credits, and the wicked wit of the dialogue. When Van Orton's brother asks, ""Don't you think of me anymore?'' he shoots back, ""Not since family week at rehab.'' And when his ex-wife asks if he had a nice birthday, he answers, ""Does Rose Kennedy have a black dress?'' The film's dark look, its preference for shadows, recalls ""Seven'' and also Fincher's ""Alien 3."" The big screen reveals secrets and details in dark corners; on video, they may disappear into the murk. Like ""Seven,'' the plotting is ingenious and intelligent, and although we think we know the arc of the film (egotist is reduced to greater humility and understanding of himself), it doesn't progress in a docile, predictable way; for one thing, there is the real possibility that the Game is not an ego-reduction program, but a death plot.<br/><br/>Douglas is the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change. Indeed, one of the refreshing things about the film is that it stays true to its paranoid vision right up until what seems like the very end--and then beyond it, so that by the time the real ending arrives, it's not the payoff and release as much as a final macabre twist of the knife."

","David Fincher's first movie was the polarized ""Alien 3."" All he needed to do to make an acclaimed film was make a psychological thriller and his career was set into motion. Fincher has outdone himself since, but for most other directors this would be their peak.<br/><br/>At the centre of the piece is Nicholas Van Orton, played to the usual max by Michael Douglas. He lives the lap of luxury but is very lonely. Having no friends and only one family member (Sean Penn), none of Nick's millions of dollars has made him happy. The suicide of his father is also engraved in his memory.<br/><br/>Nick's brother, Conrad, seems to be the only person in the world that cares about him. For his older brother's birthday, Conrad summons Nick to participate in a ""game."" Nick is very reluctant but goes along with it anyway. Ready to be given instructions and get the whole thing over with, Nick's uneventful life soon turns into one near disaster moment after another. He meets a girl named Christine (Unger) who helps him survive. She may or may not be part of this game.<br/><br/>I must talk about the twist because I think that's what makes the movie so good. Nick almost getting into deadly accidents and all the scares are just a series of setups by Conrad so that Nick can have fun. Conrad had to get almost the entire town of San Fransisco to play along and fool his brother. Almost anyone else would be pissed that all these near-death situations were just pranks. But Nick is just happy to be alive. He is also flattered that all of these strangers would go through so much just so that he would have a ""good time."" I guess that's possible, but this almost seems to be an adult fable.<br/><br/>Nonstop excitement and no predictability make the climax all-the-more rewarding.<br/><br/>4/4"
"frankde-jong","7","0","0","13 December 2019"," One of the best performances of Michael Douglas
","The beginning of the ""The game"" is very stong. We see Michael Douglas as the self righteous, grumpy, egocentric (in short nasty) rich businessman Nicholas van Orton. Nobody likes this guy and that becomes extremely clear when he celebrates his 48th birthday all on his own in his big house watching CNN and eating a hamburger.<br/><br/>A day later he gets a present from his brother. It is a ticket to a tailor made game. From then on the film tells the biblical story of Job, learning a rich man humility (apart from the fact that Job was rich but good from the beginning). The life of the control freak Van Orton is turned upside down and he seems to lose all his money. It is no coincidence that on the film poster his face disintegrates in the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>Director Fincher tells the Job story in a spectacular way. The fact that a crime element or a crime possibility is always lurking on the background maintains the tension. As a viewer you forget that the story is highly unprobable. The organisation of the game seems capable of 100% predicting the reactions of Van Orton. It almost seems like the detective Dupin in the Edgar Allan Poe story ""The murders in the Rue Morgue""."
"doctord-1","8","0","0","3 August 2019"," A gamey ending. But solid all around
","I must admit it was hard not to be enthralled with The Game. Well written with solid acting choices, The Game gives you the basic plot setup from the start, without ever really letting on to exactly where it's going. It may seem slow to start on first viewing, but when it starts rolling, like our main character, you're rolling right with it. It's one of few movies where you feel you just might not have a grip on where it stands. The only setback is the somewhat implausible ending. Scratch that. Very implausible. They could have had filthy-rich Nick Van Orton win the Powerball instead. The odds may have been better that the odds of pulling off the climactic finish and or ""stunt"" in the grand finale. But as Steven Spielberg once said of an implausible ending to Jaws, ""I had the audience glued this far, I could probably end it any way I wanted."" Same here. But if you shake your head in disbelief in the last few minutes, you still won't regret the first 120 or so that take you on a puzzling, fun ride."

"classicsoncall","7","0","0","17 June 2018"," ""This is your game Nicholas, and welcome to it.""
","What I'll say about ""The Game"" is what I say about a lot of action/thriller films. As you're watching, the story engages with an innovative concept, uses clever twists and delivers excitement at a visceral level. But then, when you have time to reflect on the story, it kind of falls apart when you consider what would have been required to pull it all off. This one relied on Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) to make the decisions precisely that he did, especially at the very end when his attempted suicide was thwarted to put an end to the game. How did the 'Game' manipulators know he would even think of something like that? Sure they ran that psychological profile, but by the time came when he shot his brother Conrad (Sean Penn), Van Orton's judgment would have been severely put to the limit to act rationally. <br/><br/>There's also the complexity of the set-ups, which would have required months of planning and getting the right players in place to pull off the Game. No way could it have been rigged during the amount of time allotted for Van Orton to begin the game as soon as he signed off on it. And how about a situation like the one in which the taxi driver bailed and the cab plunged into the river? One assumes that the assassin bullets were blanks and the shattered objects that were hit were set off with miniature explosives, but how would you explain Van Orton making his way out of the sinking cab in time to avoid drowning? It all requires a major suspension of disbelief to view the events happening on screen as if they were actually possible.<br/><br/>And finally, who would have come up with the price tag for this extraordinary con job? Conrad didn't appear to have the means to pull it off, which leads us to the idea that Nicholas Van Orton would probably have had to foot the bill to scare the living crap out of himself. With that kind of money, he could have gotten himself a real birthday present."

This is like an extended Twilight Zone episode, with twist upon gotcha upon twist. While these were good, they weren't mind-blowing. The best descriptor is ""competent"". As far as his film's go, it's in my second tier of his selections along with _Panic Room_. Competent but not extraordinary. That said, it's still leaps above your typical Hollywood barf. Fincher managed to snag Michael Douglas for this, one would assume on the tails of the much superior _Se7en_from 2 years prior. That's a minus for me - I find it hard to take Douglas films seriously.<br/><br/>But I nitpick. By general standards this is superb viewing for stay-at-home, night in popcorn viewing.

It is a very thrilling movie as we see a man get involved with an organisation that he can not seem to get himself out of. It has all the elements you would expect from a David Fincher movie, his talent for telling a story and setting up a dark, eerie atmosphere is very evident here. <br/><br/>The film did feel too muddled for its own good, there was a sense that they were making it confusing for its audience because they did not know where they were going with it. Rather than building up the exciting twists and turns they had planned well in advance, the script felt like the writers were making it all up as they went on.<br/><br/>The ending is the major disappointment for me and makes the entire film as a whole feel very flawed. It is nowhere near as exciting as we would have anticipated, and I felt somewhat cheated on by this underwhelming finale.<br/><br/>The film shows that a thriller will not work to full effect if we are following a protagonist who really knows nothing, and finds out very little as the plot progresses. It could have worked better as a puzzle solver, rather than scene after scene that raises more questions than it answers. Thrilling and entertaining, The Game certainly does not shine as much as some of Fincher's other work, nor is it as enjoyable as Michael Douglas' previous thrillers, but I would still say it is worth the watch if you are looking for a good Mystery, just do not go out of your way to see it. <br/><br/>On his birthday, a wealthy businessman's brother gives him a present in which he becomes involved with the CRS, a mysterious organisation with unusual motives. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Michael Douglas"

","I know it's got about an 8/10 here on IMDb but its metascore is only 61, which is a ridiculous average, and overall people just never ever ever talk about this film although by my count this is a better film than Seven or Fight Club which weren't as clever or well constructed or intelligent as this one, and they get a ton more notoriety. Douglas is just superb in this one, and Penn, Unger put in very good performances as seconds too. It's a film which concept is so concise you'd think it should be made into an episode of a mystery-type series, and that it could never work out as a 2hrs+ silverscreen production, that its plot would run out of breath too soon and that it would need a bunch of exterior elements added to the plot to keep it relevant and that eventually the dynamics of it would be bent towards the middle-to-end area because the twist seems obvious etc... but none of that. None of it at all. The film is completely coherent with its tamed, nightly atmosphere. It is subtle and vows to put most technical questions about the plot the viewer may have to sleep. It's very careful and professionally handled in laying out all the premises and details necessary to making the plot possible, plausible; and til the very end, we are truly kept away from the secret. The twist is very strong, and a satisfying release of tension, with questions answered; and quite moving too. All in all, very ambitious project, and: mission accomplished. Superb piece."

","I have seen this film twice. While it is my least favorite of Fincher's, i still like it. Rarely a dull moment. If you're a fan of suspense, you're in luck. Overall, i would say the core of this tale is Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. Majority of the movie is set in San Francisco,with a brief, but cool view of the Golden Gate Bridge by night during one of the more dramatic scenes. It is unfortunate, however, that you realize how far fetched the whole story is by the end of the movie. Regardless, the cast is not bad at all and the acting not too shabby. After all, we're talking about Michael Douglas and Sean Penn here... playing brothers. Good score; very effective. Moral of the story: Don't let your childhood crap ruin your adult life."

","The Game. A gripping mystery with the victim of the dangerous game played efficiently by Michael Douglas keeps you on the edge throughout the run time except the last five minuets.

For obvious reasons I can't tell you why I felt cheated at the end, after all it is a mystery. Smooth uncluttered narration done with haunting back ground score with lots of twists and turns makes you feel intrigued. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for The Game.

","Michael Douglas accepts an invitation to join a mysterious exclusive ""recreation activity"" at the insistence of his loser brother, and is then thoroughly terrorized by the game makers. It's a mile-a-minute barrel ride over the edge of a waterfall, with the audience left in the dark right alongside the protagonist. Young director David Fincher plays up the suspense gorgeously, but isn't quite able to compensate for a few inherent flaws with the premise. First and foremost is Douglas's leading part, a thoroughly unlikeable one-percenter who's such a Scrooge it's impossible to grow too invested in his fate. In a way it's cathartic to see him tormented by such a brutal series of twists and turns, especially in the afterglow of the Wall Street bailout, but the film goes out of its way to paint him as a sort of tragic hero. The plot's reckless yanks on the steering wheel, too, aren't all they're cracked up to be. Those constant swerves provide a great series of unpredictable thrills, but ultimately ring hollow when our suspension of disbelief is nudged too far beyond the coincidental. The entire closing sequence, in particular, is just so dependent on things happening in precisely the right place, at precisely the right time, in precisely the right way, that it left me questioning the validity of everything that had come before. A nice effort, and a strong-legged concept, that falls short in too many important areas to deserve high marks."

","The Game is another one of those very fine examples of style over substance. There are great action set pieces, some slick dialogue, some sparkling acting and some fantastic direction from David Fincher. But, in the end, where does it really lead? Not really anywhere. Fortunately for this film, because there is so much going on, you can afford to forgive the ending. <br/><br/>Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) is a cynical, detached banker. He has an ex wife he takes no notice of. He has a brother who is clearly disturbed and he has to live with the knowledge that his father committed suicide in front of him. He lives only to make business deals and cares only for money. <br/><br/>That is, until his brother gives him a birthday present - a ticket for something known as 'The Game'. Reluctantly, Van Orten signs up to this game, little realising that he's opening up a total nightmare. Soon, he is apparently the victim of fraud, his house is broken into, there are attempts to kill him and his brother is apparently committed. Van Orten is left to try and solve everything himself, using only his wits and whatever sense is left in him. <br/><br/>Make no mistake that this film is worth watching. For several exceptional reasons. Firstly, the script and in particular the dialogue is pretty sharp with some cracking action and some good dark humour. Secondly, David Fincher directs this with his usual talent for dark atmosphere and slick action. There are some exceptionally good action scenes and some carefully crafted talk scenes that always move the film forward at breathtaking pace. Finally, the acting it absolutely outstanding. Every part in this film is cast as perfectly as possible. Michael Douglas shines in a role that he is always so well suited to. Sean Penn, someone I'm not usually keen on, adds real paranoia and depth to his scenes, and the two leads are then supported by several very talented character actors that give more than the film gives them in return. <br/><br/>The problem here is the ending. It's not all that believable, and feels more like a last minute cop-out because they were either nor sure how to end it, or were too afraid to make it even darker. The ending isn't just unbelievable - realistically it's not possible. After suffering all that he does throughout the film, there's little chance that Van Orten could take that one final twist. He'd either be insane, or a broken man. Instead what we get is something a little too happy, and not dark enough for the rest of the film. <br/><br/>However, ending aside, this film is very, very good. I'd still recommend it, even if just for everything up until the ending, the first rate acting and the atmospheric and slick directing."

","The Game is a suspenseful mystery about a wealthy banker, Nicholas Van Orton played my Michael Douglas, who is a loner in life. The movie stems around Nicholas' 48th birthday. Nicholas watched his father comment suicide by jumping off of his home's rooftop at the age of 48. Nicholas is deeply troubled by this throughout his life and even more on his birthday. The audience is made aware of this because of several flashback scenes in which Nicholas relives seeing his father commit suicide. Nicholas has a younger brother named Conrad who is played by Sean Penn. Conrad has had several addictions in his life and has had a distant relationship with his brother. Conrad visits Nicholas to give him a birthday gift. He gives him a certificate to Consumer Recreation Services which Conrad tells him is a company that creates a real life game to play and urges Nicholas to try it. Nicholas' curiosity is peaked and he signs up for the game. He does a day's worth of testing and then is told that CRS couldn't make a game for him. Shortly after that he finds himself in a real life game in which he is the key player. The game is played out and pushes Nicholas to his limits physically, mentally, and emotionally. As he plays the game he keeps meeting up with Christine played by Deborah Kara Unger. Christine tells Nicholas that she knows information about the game and is valuable to him and that he needs to keep her around. Nicholas is put in several life and death situations throughout the game. He also begins to trust no one when he learns that the game was all about CRS's owner, Jim Feingold played by James Rebhorn, taking away everything that Nicholas has worked for. He believes that Jim has emptied all of his accounts and taken everything that he has worked for.<br/><br/>Finally Nicholas has been pushed to his limit and goes to the CRS office in hopes to find out who is behind the whole game. When he goes to the office he finds many familiar faces that have all played different roles in this game. He takes Christine hostage and they end up on the roof top. Christine tries to calm Nicholas down and explain what is going on but he is on the verge of a breakdown. Since he took her hostage he believes that everyone is coming to get him and that's all he can concentrate on. When the door opens to the rooftop, Nicholas fires before seeing who's there. It turns out that some of the key players to the game are there with Conrad. Nicholas had shot and killed Conrad as he stood there with a bottle of champagne. The other players in the game can't believe what happened. The game had gone too far. Nicholas is so distraught that he jumps off of the building believing that his fate is the same as his father's at this point. He falls several stories and then through a glass rooftop where he surprisingly lands on a giant airbag. This was the final stage of the game. All of his family and friends are there expecting his arrival. His brother is also there. His staged death was also part of the game.<br/><br/>His brother got him the game for his birthday in hopes of shining some light on his life and showing him that he can enjoy life and not be held back by the fact he watched his father commit suicide. Nicholas seems very thankful for the game his brother got him. This movie reminded me of the movie Crash with the constant mystery and then satisfaction of seeing how all of the characters were intertwined among one another. There were several scenes that were very dark in the movie. The low lighting helped both the mood of the scenes and the suspense of not knowing if there was more to come in a particular scene. The Game continued to be mysterious and suspenseful throughout the movie right up until the end. I thought the game was over when Nicholas shot Conrad. Then I thought it was over when he jumped off of the roof. In reality the game didn't end until Nicholas arrived at his birthday party."

","A rubbix cube, like any normal game in life can do many things for its player. It can excite them, challenge them, and at some notable point frustrate them drastically, out of the person's natural desire to simply win. In Director Fincher's 3rd directorial film, ""The Game"", its main player of focus Nicholas Vanhorton (Douglas) is never thrilled nor excited about the game he receives at the recommendation of his recovering addict brother, Conrad (Penn). Connie's suggestion proves to be interesting enough, for many other revealed players have proclaimed CRS to be a life changing experience. In fact one player in particular quoted ""Where as once I was blind, now I can see"" John Ch.9 verse 25, and trust me Nick sees quite the sight. Within the next few days his patience, and his usually calm demeanor are pushed through the limits of his character. Witnessing the destruction of his home, nearly drowning, and even being watched at every angle and location possible, Nicholas's hopes for an end to the game seem lost, not as lost as his brother, for he too was a participant. Nicholas's only hope is a mysterious woman named Christine, who apparently works for the company and reveals enough to give Nicholas no reason to trust anyone, including her. When Nicholas first attended CRS, it was disorganized, riddled with odd and even pointless question regarding the physical and physiological, all good factors serving as forefronts to distract him, with enough time for them to make him their pawn. His accounts, his lawyers, and even his business associates seem to be un trust worthy, with the possibility of being his enemies. It becomes very clear, in the game's true motive of changing the player completely, for Nicholas himself wasn't exactly the nicest guy around. He wasn't evil, nor greedy, just simply miserable. Witnessing your own dad's suicide can really leave some marks, marks that probably made him into the person he is. Despite being an investment banker, closing deals with various clients, moving large sums of money to various accounts, and living a more than accommodating lifestyle, Nick always had this calm, but nevertheless suppressed anger, an anger that soon diminishes at the games final and ever most devastating stage. In the wake of Nick's last chance to unravel the truth of the whole matter and settle this insane game of unending madness at gunpoint, all he is given are constant warnings, and how if he continues he'll regret his actions if not stopped. In the moments of desperation for the truth, Nicholas shoots an approaching figure, turning out to be his brother. Driven to depression over the murder of his brother, suicide becomes his last option. That fails just as much as any chance he truly had of figuring the game out on his own. His fall from who really knows how many stories turns out to be yet another part of the game. Hell the whole plan was Conrad's idea, with the purpose of changing his brother and preventing him from ever turning out like their father. In the end Nick hugs is actually alive brother in grief and relief, with a possible better outlook on his life. ""The Game"" may not be David Fincher's masterpiece, but I can certainly call it one of Michael Douglas's finest performances, portraying a character with so much anger, and misery to define his persona, that happiness is rarely shown throughout his role at all. The only glimpse of a smile viewers will get from him will be in the end as he asks Christine (Unger) for dinner. I would honestly say that the way Douglas portrayed his character was very cold, that his cold and suppressed nature perfectly fits the creepy neo noir theme of the film, making his very anger very ravage when released during moments of intensity, or personal confusion to Vanhorton. It's sad to say though that Douglas's acting isn't enough to save the film. ""The Game"" has no limits when it comes to playing with its character. All these crazy acts are physically possible, but not legal. In fact, even though the push for Nick's concluding character development was perfectly fit, it still makes you wonder if the film could've made it a little more tragic, because it was really a pretend scenario meant to help him. It sounds like Nick dodged a bullet, when most people who change for the better get a taste of the bullet. It's not easy to learn what you have in front of you, and feel like you've done everything to lose it, but when it's fake in the character's, rather than then actor's perspective, the drama seems not to moving. I still enjoyed the film, but it would have been better if CRS was a company for evil rather than well intentioned purposes, making the purpose of Nick's development all the more valuable."

","Nicholas Van Orton is given a strange birthday gift from his brother. It's a card that tells him to go to this place called CRS, Consumer Recreation Services. They give Nicholas a chance to be a participant in a game. Things get a little too out of hand when the game itself becomes life threatening and Nicholas can't seem to stop it.<br/><br/>The Game is never really mentioned when talking about Fincher and his body of work, good or bad it gets left on the cutting room floor. I guess it's because the film is the middleman sort to speak. You have Se7en, and Fight Club, his two most popular and fan favourite films. Then you have Panic Room and Alien 3, considered lower calibre. Zodiac and Benjamin Button seem to be in a totally different class here, but The Game deserves to be mentioned because it is a well written, thought provoking thriller that manages to peel away at it's mysteries and never have the viewer bored. Even the film's ending, which many people seem to complain about, did not make me hate the film, or think the first 80 or so minutes were a waste. <br/><br/>The film looks and feels just like Fincher's others. It's cold, dark and unforgiving. He manages to craft his most suspenseful film to date and having Michael Douglass run around trying to solve the mystery helps the case. I'm a sucker for films full of mystery, that slowly but surely peel away at those mysteries to reveal the truth. A lot of crime films are like this, but The Game is something different. A bit more psychological, another reason why I liked it so much. Much like Memento, we are lost like the lead character. We know it's a game, he knows it's a game. But we, nor him, know exactly what the game is or what is happening next. We are trying to solve the same mysteries and Fincher makes us care about these things. <br/><br/>Complaints for the film are ones that would have me base the film is reality. To believe the stuff that happens in the film is for one to suspend a lot of belief. The film ends in a way that made me think whether I liked it or not. I would have preferred the first ending, as opposed to the second one, but the way they did it didn't ruin the film. I'm not sure how I will feel on repeated viewings, but as it stands, the thrills were still there and I still enjoyed them. I'm still left with some character motivation questions, some that I will not go into for the sake of spoiling things in the film. <br/><br/>Douglass, whom I usually hate, does a great job here. He is a jerk that slowly begins to unwind his sanity. His Gordon Gekko demeanor works here and yet we still root for his character. Sean Penn has a small role, one too small for me to really comment on and the supporting cast usually only have a scene or two to do anything. Deborah Kara Unger plays a good role in which we have to decide whether or not we trust her. She usually plays wackos. <br/><br/>The Game is something that might frustrate you with the ending, but that's what films are all about, getting some kind of emotional response. I'm not a fan of the last 3 or 4 minutes, to me it seemed to be tacked on by pressure of the studio and would not be something Fincher would normally do. But in the end, The Game is a worthy film if you are looking for a suspenseful thriller."

","According to Game Theory (a branch of mathematics), a game consists of a set of players, a set of moves (or strategies) available to those players, and a specification of payoffs for each combination of strategies. What make several non-mathematicians astonish in this definition is that nothing is said about the object of playing. From non-mathematical games we know that one can play with balls, chess-figures, straws (Halma), dominoes, etc. But what happens when one of the players become the object of the play or game? According to the above definition, then, he must know about the moves of the game, and also about the specification of payoffs for every move - in this special case also for his own moves and not only for those of the other players.<br/><br/>This is, abstractly said, what ""The Game"" (1997), a very intelligent and metaphysically deep movie, is about. Mr. Van Orton gets as a very special gift from his brother with whom he has a very problematic relationship, a gift which is on first sight nothing more than an entrance billet to a VIP-club. After Mr. Van Orton has filled in a very detailed questionnaire, the play starts - but without knowing him any parts which belong per definition to any game. As a matter of fact, the audience who does in this case not has the luck of the distant observer to be always at least one step in front of the protagonist, gets involved in the game, too, and without knowing that until just before the movie ends. Therefore, the game, which is based, both the main actor and for the watcher, on fully obscure rules, appears more like a dream, or better a nightmare, and the only question in the two hours of running time is: When and how will this nightmare end? In the end, however, one will see that a game which is based on the violation of all defining rules of what a game must be, has to follow enormously complex rules in order not to risk the life of the object of the game."

And the studio took out its gigantic pair of scissors and turned what COULD HAVE BEEN in my opinion, one of those movies that people talk about 20 years later into a half-decent TV movie. He could have just made TOUCH OF EVIL or REBECCA. Fincher could have taken a stand and had some stones. But he is a sellout!

Just two of the idiotic things he has said: (paraphrasing) ""I don't make low budget movies cause i can only imagine expensive movies"".

","Well... what can I say? The movie gets a stellar grade of 7 out of 10, because the acting, directing, editing, music, and cinematography were all very well done. However, despite a genuinely suspenseful thriller that was 'The Game,' I can't help but feel frustrated at the conclusion to the whole ordeal. There are countless instances in which the main character, and the subject of the deadly ""game,"" acts abruptly upon whatever trouble finds him, yet is lead to believe that the game-makers, a company called CRS, knew exactly what his actions would be. When viewing the film, one is almost certain to, at some point in the movie, ask themselves: how could they REALLY have known Nick (the main character) was going to do that. I can only suggest to see it for yourself, though I can, and will, do so with a high recommendation."

","""The Game"" took me on one extraordinary psychological thrill ride after another loaded with twists and turns scene after scene.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas pulled off one of his best performances as Nicholas Van Orton, a man who is approaching his birthday. Nicholas receives an invitation to play a game given to him by his brother Conrad played by Sean Penn. He reluctantly agrees and soon finds out that the game is more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film because I never knew who was trustworthy or what was going to happen next, this truly was one film that must be seen by those who enjoy never knowing for sure how a movie will turn out.<br/><br/>""The Game"" is all Michael Douglas and how well he pulls off his role of being the innocent who happens to be in the middle of a game he can't control. However, a really good movie can not be pulled off by one actor, a whole lot of credit should go to the supporting cast that includes Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger for their convincing portrayals in this film."

Then I saw it again on video, and I started seeing the plausibility factor and the suspension of belief dwindling away. It's the same thing that 1999's ""ARLINGTON ROAD"" was criticized for: NOBODY CAN FORTELL THE FUTURE THAT ACCURATELY WITHOUT A LITTLE TIME TRAVEL GOING ON!!!

","I love this movie, and have seen it several times. The first time you see the movie through Van Orton's eyes. The next time you watch the film you see it from CRS's view. This, to me, makes it great. Upon repeated viewing's I realized just how clever this film is. <br/><br/>It seems, though, that some people who watch this just won't pick up on a few things, and be left in the dark.<br/><br/>For instance, even though you might not react the same way that Van Orton acts, it doesn't matter because The Game is designed around him. They studied him for a whole day with comprehensive psychological exams, and probably learned a whole lot more from his brother. That way they know what he will most likely do, and have several safety nets in place if he doesn't. Magicians and Mentalists use these kind of techniques all the time in their shows.<br/><br/>If you focus too much on what you would do during the movie, it might effect your enjoyment of it, and might make you miss the whole point of the movie altogether. <br/><br/>This movie is amazing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>****SPOILER WARNING****<br/><br/>The only problem I had with this is the end. No, it's not that I wanted him to die. In fact I think it would have ruined the movie if he had died. To think that CRS could manipulate him so completely up to that point and then... whoops he's dead.. would have been a cop-out. No, the only problem I had was that if he had strayed to a few feet to the left when he went through the glass he would have hit a cross beam. The movie could have turned into a black comedy very easily. That's my one and only complaint.<br/><br/>******END SPOILER******"

So the studio have to reshoot & rewrite the ending (That's where I think the ""Gonna shear some more sheep"" line comes from, it sounds like it was written in a hurry).<br/><br/>Why? Why? Why?

#1-If Nicholas did something absolutely ludicrist like go dancing buck naked down the white house lawn, would he be arrested by secret service guys also hired by CRS?  If Nicholas was mangled alive by savage dogs and taken to the hospital, would the surgeons also be actors hired by CRS?  If you've seen the movie, and haven't gotten my point, i'll make it perfectly clear.  There are too many CRS actors stationed in too many strange places throughout the movie. Consumer Recreational Services could not have predicted Nicholas would have been at half of the places that he ended up at, interacting with people hired by CRS.  This would be unless there is some stupid conspiracy where half the world secretly works for CRS.  Beware of the new world order! Haha.<br/><br/>#2-CRS could pull of all of their tricks with absolute precision. I don't believe for a second that they could have covered all the things Nicholas could have, or would have done.  Somewhere, some how, something is bound to go wrong as expose the entire outfit.  Maybe that did sort of happen when Nicholas discovers that the guy who interviewed him for CRS was a freelance actor who does pill commercials.  But this is one more reason why CRS could not formulate games for people to play- someone, somewhere, would have pull out an ace that would surprise and screw up the whole thing.  Like for example, I give CRS credit that they might have predicted that Nicholas would try to commit suicide at the end.  But how did they know where the exact spot he would jump off the building would be at?  They had a landing cushion set exactly under him when he fell down.  Yeah, mmmkay, I buy that (psyche).<br/><br/>#3-I understand that the function of the game was to make corporate big whigs lighten up and be less of a prick.  However, one must have a strange sense of humor to laugh or even smile after it is over.  How do they know Micheal Douglas's character wouldn't have jumped off the cushion in the end and slugged someone in the face, then pressed charges.  And believe me, when you have a lawsuit pending against you from a big corporate guy, it's a pretty good idea not to try and stimulate them through a strange and often illegal sense of humor."

I had heard mixed things about this movie, but became intrigued by it while watching.  What piqued my interest was the question as to what kind of ""game"" it was.<br/><br/>Warning, many SPOILERS FOLLOW.<br/><br/>The notion that they started messing with your mind was very interesting. Then it starts to degenerate -- they really just want to steal your money. OK, I can deal with that, that makes it at least an interesting plot twist and makes a comment -- things you do for fun sometimes get out of your control. And of course the complete breakdown of the world's wealthiest and most self-centered man was fun to watch.<br/><br/>I was even with them for the first (trick) ending.  After Conrad was ""shot,"" I was thinking it was an interesting movie, and when Nicholas pitches himself off the building, I was truly impressed.  At that point, that was his only way out after killing his brother as the result of a prank.  It made perfect sense and I felt a good sense of relief that the film would end that way, even if the shot of him dropping to the pavement went on for a while.<br/><br/>Then he starts crashing through the glass, not once, but twice, and then lands on a big safety air mattress.  Until I noticed the big X in the center, I was thinking that it was there for another reason unconnected to him, and that by some freak of fate he was going to live through this and have to deal with the consequences.  Even better.<br/><br/>Then the whole thing falls apart when Conrad walks in alive.  Sure, there's a moment of ""wow,"" but then you have to think what your reaction would be. I'd have killed the little punk, not hugged him. I'd go and find real bullets for that gun after what he put me through, if I was Nicholas. Would have wrecked the party, but hey, that's what you get if you mess with someone's head like that.<br/><br/>Like other Hollywood movies, it seems that more folks had their hands in the pie and dictated a happy ending.  Had it ended with both of them dying, it would be a great movie.  This way, it's just another schlocky movie that panders to the perceived need for a happy ending, and tries unsuccessfully to make some comment about the dangers of being wealthy and self-centered. And ultimately, those dangers and the repercussions are not real, so the lesson is completely lost."

He knows nothing about it or the rules, but we're led to believe that his rather empty, wealthy life has left him with an overwhelming ennui, so this slightly rash decision on his part was sort of credible. At the end we discover that all the terrible things that have happened to him (being shot at, nearly drowned, buried alive in Mexico, his beautiful house being trashed, losing his multi-million dollar fortune) were all faked to make him think these things were happening. I could almost have bought that. BUT, and here's the clincher for me, the final act in the game was to make him believe he shot his own brother dead. Believing this, he leaps from the roof of the building to kill himself. He falls firstly through the glass roof of the restaurant below, then into a huge inflatable crash mat, put there to cushion his 10-storey fall. Yes, this was just another trick--part of the game. The whole game was a birthday treat paid for by his brother to spice up his life a bit. Uh huh. What if he'd jumped a few feet to one side? Are we seriously meant to believe that his brother would risk him missing the mat and exploding on the sidewalk as part of a birthday treat? Ludicrous. And then, discovering all this, the rich guy is all smiles and handshakes and thanks for a great time? Wow. Even watching this movie made me want to kill everyone involved in the game.

But even so, in a movie that puts your protagonist through all manner of doubt and peril, I might've cared about his character were the direction not so detached. This movie is cold.

What if he'd picked a different side of the roof to step over? And there's no way any sane human being wouldn't cold cock Sean Penn for that.

She reported so much stuff that she thought was staged on her daily routine and at the end even said she rethought many aspects of her life. Then, Derren reveals that nothing was ever staged on her daily routine - no actors, nothing.

I doubt that. It's impossible that everything was always under control. Something could have gotten out of hand. People could get injured. The guy could go insane. He could have a cardiac arrest during his suicidal fall. He could be traumatized forever. No previous tests could predict his behavior, reactions or mental health like we are supposed to believe. <br/><br/>And I'm sure several laws were broken in the process of making this torture game that somehow ended with happiness all around - A birthday party.

Now the reason this is frustrating is that a large amount of stuff in the movie doesn't make sense within this context. I mean there is one point in the movie where he is in a taxi and they drive into the water and he nearly drowns. So, that means he was in actual danger right? Like lots of people just panic when they drive their car into the water and are unable to escape. If that happened would they just be like oops sorry. Didn't mean for that to happen. Also what happened to the cab driver in that scene? Also I guess at the end when he shoots his brother but his brother is alright implying that their were blanks in the gun. But if you made someone that desperate couldn't that have unintended consequences? I mean what if his gun got knocked away and he got so scared that he beat someone to death? Also when he jumps off the building how the heck would they even know where he would land? Like oops your brother fell two meters left than expected so now he's dead. Also, how the heck did they know he jump. And just generally how did they account for pretty much everything that happened in this movie. I mean when the cab driver picks him up did they not account for the fact that he could take another cab? To be fair David Fincher still does a great job directing the movie and most of the acting is pretty good but i just couldn't stand this script.

","Actor Michael Douglas is one of those rare Hollywood talents who doesn't make a fool o of himself on screen. An excellent judge of movie scripts, he either creates trends as he did with ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Basic Instinct,"" or catches them before they curdle as with ""Romancing the Stone."" In British director David Fincher's latest excursion into paranoia, ""The Game,"" Douglas has found not only a choice role for himself but also a provocative thriller that is as cerebral as it is tantalizing. You won't have nightmares from watching ""The Game,"" but you might think twice about that next alcoholic drink somebody else pours for you. Scenarists John Brancato and Michael Ferris have penned an imaginative but mischievous movie that lifts elements from the Yul Brynner chiller ""Westworld"" (1973) and the 1932 classic adventure epic ""The Most Dangerous Game."" Neither a science fiction opus nor a gruesome adventure, ""The Game"" is an enthralling melodrama that keeps you dangling for most of its lengthy running time. If you're one of those moviegoers who strives to stay a step ahead of the hero, ""The Game"" may frustrate you. Brancato and Ferris serve up a number of obvious clichÃ©s and rely on time-proved plot gimmicks. Nevertheless, they have integrated both into the action so seamlessly that you should think before you complain. In ""The Game,"" characterization and motivation ably abet the vicissitudes of a deliberately murky and incredibly far-fetched story. No, ""The Game"" is not as aggravating as the Mel Gibson, sleight-of-hand thriller ""Conspiracy Theory"" with Julia Roberts. <br/><br/>Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton. He is a strictly business oriented tycoon who would warm the cockles of Mr. Scrooge's heart. Divorced from his wife, he resides in a dark, tomb-like, palatial mansion with huge, wrought-iron gates. Van Orton's maid (the 1960s' bombshell Carroll Baker of ""Baby Doll"" fame) dutifully cooks and cleans for him, but their relationship is distant, too. He keeps everybody at arm's length, and his personality is as remote as it is regimented. Van Orton has no qualms about firing an employee on the spot. In sum, Van Orton combines the ruthless characteristics of Douglas' honcho in ""Wall Street"" with the awkward social graces of Harrison Ford's banker in ""Sabrina."" Van Orton is not a sympathetic character, so everything that befalls him in ""The Game"" constitutes a just comeuppance for the shoddy way that he has treated people.<br/><br/>That's part of the fun of ""The Game."" The Douglas protagonist is an out-and-out bastard. He deserves all the bad luck that he stumbles across, and we get to cheer every obstacle that he encounters because it is going to screw up the carefully preserved life that he has constructed for himself. You don't so much worry about how Van Orton effects his hair-raising escapes in ""The Game"" as you indulge in the way those cliffhangers challenge him. Van Orton's 48th birthday is creeping up, but he is in no mood to celebrate. In a series of superbly done flashbacks that resemble vintage Super-8 movies, Van Orton relives the suicide plunge that his equally remote father took on his own 48th birthday. Into Van Orton's musty, stale lif34 bursts his black sheep brother played with marvelous abandon by bad boy Sean Penn. It is an amazing coup of casting that works because Conrad is so much Nicholas' opposite in both personality and temperament. Conrad gate-crashes Nicholas' private club and breaks the rules about smoking because his older brother is so highly placed. He presents Nicholas with a belated birthday present. It's a gift certificate from an obscure agency called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).<br/><br/>Conrad assures Nicholas that ""the game"" will put the fun back into his humdrum existence. At first, Van Orton is reluctant to contact CRS. Curiosity gets the better of him. When he goes in for an interview, he finds the CRS people are neither deferential nor accommodating. They require him to fill out time-consuming questionnaires and perform various physical skills tests. When they're finished with these grueling tests, they assure him that they'll call him about his evaluation. Miffed at their callous treatment, Nicholas stalks out. Of course, Nicholas qualifies to play the game. What exactly is the game? ""The Game"" is one of those movies that you only really get to see once. The filmmakers are depending on your own curiosity as much as your frustration with the lengthy setup for the story. <br/><br/>Almost an hour into ""The Game,"" you still aren't totally sure what is happening. It's as if the filmmakers are stalking their audience, delaying their revelations as long as they can to get the most out of both the plot and the audience. If you have the patience for this complicated build-up, you'll be rewarded. If you see ""The Game"" a second time, you'll appreciate that long build-up because you'll see it coming and its multiple surprises won't catch you as off-guard like they may on first viewing. While credit must be given to both the calculated efforts of writers Brancato and Ferris, director David Fincher probably deserves the lion's share of the success of ""The Game."" A former music video direction, Finch broke into the movies with ""Alien 3"" back in 1992. <br/><br/>The performances contribute to the success of ""The Game,"" too. Douglas is perfectly cast as Nicholas Van Orton, and Peen's intermittent appearances are cleverly timed. Deborah Kara Unger of Crash"" fame looks as if she could be the next Sharon Stone as the sexy siren who lures Van Orton to his destruction. ""The Game"" has a haunting quality, and you can't be sure whether the filmmakers are out to scare you or have a joke at your expense. As they used to say in the vintage Patrick McGoohan sci-fi television show ""The Prisoner"" to say anything more about ""The Game"" would be ""telling."""
"spacefoam314","10","2","5","26 November 2006"," Wonderful photography
","We all know that certain aspects of ""The Game"" are impossible but who cares its a movie. I was floored by the photography of the movie. The darkness in the movie is clearly used as an art form. Much like an artist working with their color pallet, which would include blue, black, and various shades of grey. The film demonstrates a washed out appearance which adds to the overall mood of the film. Even the film grain adds edge to the film. The lighting adds unbelievable ambiance to certain character scenes/interactions. For example some of the kitchen scenes with Michael Douglas. The sound brings the film to an unbelievable level. Especially the kitchen scene where Michael Douglas gets his birthday dinner. Everything is so loud and has a major echo within the kitchen. This is a perfect example of demonstrating the loneliness in his life. Even down to the song ""White Rabbit"" adds to the overall ""Alice in Wonderland"" confusion of the movie. Finally the echoing piano gives the movie a somber feel, a feeling of loneliness. It also adds to the overall chaotic feel of the movie. Never fully engaging in a orchestra at times but just a single instrument dictating the mood of the movie. Unbelievable use of sound in this movie. Strongly subtle and very low key. Matter of fact I am sure many people have missed this fine trait of the movie due to the lack of proper equipment to hear the sound. It can be best described as an immersive sound field that barely hangs in the air and eventually falls to the ground. One that your not really aware as being there until you listen for it and then it disappears just as easily. Very similar to the tactile qualities of the ""Green Mile"" This movie should find its way into peoples movie collections not only as a masterpiece but also as a solid test disc. This can demonstrate your Projector's/TV's true potential or expose its fatal flaws. This movie will also show you how responsive your receiver may or may not be."
"Quinoa1984","9","2","5","21 April 2006"," a thriller with enough paranoia and gusto to be one of the better films of 97
","The Game is basically an elaborate hoax, but unlike at least several others I've seen over the past several years, director David Fincher gets something really right about this one. The fact is the plot is so convoluted at times, so pumped with the kind of paranoia and surrealism to give Hitchcock the willies, that it almost works to annoy the viewer with the amount of manipulation it puts across. But, as it turns out, it is more about being manipulated than it is about, well, to put it this way, the audience isn't necessarily cheated as in a lessor picture. Adding to the intelligence level of the audience (or, for some, lack thereof) is superlative craftsmanship on the part of Fincher, who has carved out for him with his roster of films from the 90's quite a nook of edge-of-your-seat thrills that, at the least, isn't boring.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas is really excellent here as well, on par with some of his best work of the past decade and a half. At first his performance seems rather subdued, like a distilled version of those businessmen he plays in almost every other movie he's in. Again, part of the manipulation not just on the audience, but tenfold on the lead character. Nicholas is given a birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn), and it turns out to be 'the game', where anything can happen, and rather relentlessly at that. Soon Nicholas, cold and sort of detached from those around him, becomes super-duper paranoid and on his toes as the CRS (Consumer Recreational Services, ho-ho) goes to work on him. Pretty soon he has no money, no home, almost no life. Or is it? It's not too inappropriate to have the opening image over the credits of jigsaw puzzles is not far from what the film is itself, just one huge set laid out on the carpet.<br/><br/>If there could be anything that started to bug me as the film started to near its climax, it would be that, well, it's a reminder of both how much I like and dislike getting mind-f***ed by a movie, particularly a brilliantly shot-one like this. And the more I think about it, however, it may possibly lack something that Fincher's follow-up, Fight Club (possibly his best film to date), had, which was a connection of character to some kind of statement about something. Has the hoax that ends up showing itself as amounted to something in the way that it should've, or could've? The cat-and-mouse factor of the script, direction and acting, and the whole atmosphere is probably on par with Fincher's other work, but is there a connection with how Nicholas was and how he does become, or is it all meant for the gimmick? <br/><br/>Still, with this observation, if not quite a criticism, I still recognize this film as being a mile ahead of other films that have come in its wake. Too often do I see a film where a lead character- or characters- get the run-around (so to speak) just for the sake of the script. This time in the Game, the director- by way of the almost TOO convincing performances (that scene between Douglas and Penn in the car & stairs at night had me talking to the screen for the right and wrong reasons)- doesn't insult the audience's expectations. Bottom line, go in with a suspension of disbelief, and it's one of the better elaborate hoaxes put on film in the 90's."

","Nicholas Van Orton is an Investment Banker who has everything. He is very well organized, very successful, and always in control. The one thing that is missing in Nicholas's life is excitement. It's his 48th Birthday and lately he has been remembering his father. His father was 48th when he committed suicide, so Nicholas isn't very excited about his big 48th. When his brother, Conrad Van Orton( Sean Penn) calls; the two meet at Nichlas's Club. Conrad gives him a gift like no other. It is an invite to CRS ( Consumer Recreational Services). It is a service that provides games for people. The game is designed around an individuals background, what they like or dislike/ something missing. It's a vacation that comes to the individual; and everyone's game is different. So when Nicholas arrives at CRS; Finegold, the CEO gives him the lowdown about the company. Then Nicholas gives it a go, and after 3 hours of tests he is good to go.<br/><br/>When Nicholas gets back to his house his game has begun. When he pulls into his gated driveway, a clown is in the way. He brings it in to his mansion puts it down. He gets ready to watch his nightly financial news station, and notices a key in the clowns mouth. When he continues to watch the news; the program interrupts. The reporter tells him his game has begun, among other things including info on the camera. The reporter informs him about various keys he will be getting. These keys will all be different; and can be anything from a hotel key card to a car window handle. He will have to know how to use them, and finding out the object of the game is up to the player. There is no help your on your own. What Nicholas doesn't know is that everyone he meets is involved in this unique type of role playing game. Especially a friendly he meets at his club Kristina?( Debra Kerr).<br/><br/>At this time Nicholas is starting to lose control, something he rarely does. He is starting to believe the events that are taking place are actually happening. He is starting to confuse reality with his game. He is slowly going crazy and things get worse after he is drugged and left for dead in Mexico. The game is truly twisted with lots of suspense. I really enjoyed this movie, because it's different and a total mind upset. In reality, it would never happen. The price and consequences would keep it shelved."

","Alfred Hitchcock used the term ""refrigerator movie"" to describe certain films. According to the great director, refrigerator movies are well-paced thrillers that work effectively while being watched, but fall apart upon later examination (while ""standing in front of the refrigerator""). David Fincher's The Game is an obvious member of this class of motion pictures. As it's unspooling on screen, the film is hugely entertaining, but there are several significant plot holes that grow wider the more closely they're investigated. Douglas- who is pretty much in every scene is fantastic as the lead. This is a great thriller to watch."

","I've never been a fan of overly complex thrillers with plots that are deliberately convoluted and confusing. I can never seem to get into them and they usually end up being more frustrating than entertaining. 'The Game' falls directly into that category, and is particularly unrewarding given the awful plot twist and horrific ending, which makes the rest of the film feel like an even bigger waste of time.<br/><br/>On the surface, 'The Game' looks great. It's well made, the cinematography is top notch, and Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are excellent in their roles. While for these reasons it's a perfectly watchable film, the convoluted and unrewarding storyline, along with the unsatisfactory plot twist at the end, make 'The Game' a difficult film to like. It's clear that it wants to be a sophisticated and intelligent thriller, but ultimately it's too smart for its own good."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","2","11 October 2017"," Psychotically manipulative
","Do not try to reduce this film to only one meaning.<br/><br/>It is obviously a film centered on the relationship between an elder son and his father when the father commits suicide in front of the child's eyes when he is 48 and the child is about six or eight. The case is made more complex with the fact that there is a younger son who the elder son took care of as his brother, which is natural, but in a way oppressive in the absence of the father. Even trickier is the fact that the elder son has taken over the family estate (and business), has been married but is divorced and lives alone on the estate with the housekeeper of long ago, of the time when he was a child, hence who has known his father, though she is either older than she looks, and hence too old to take care of such an estate, or she was very young at the time of the suicide and hence cannot really remember much about the father. That connection to the past is rather loose since Ilsa should be at the least 20 at the time of the suicide and should have been hired when she was eighteen. But that is young for a servant who is now the housekeeper and has been for a long time. Otherwise forty years later she should be at retiring age and should have entered that service when she was rather 25 or 28. <br/><br/>The second element is the rivalry between two brothers in the absence of the father who spectacularly stepped out of life. Then the whole shebang being devised by the younger brother, it is a very perverse way for him to remind his elder brother whose forty-eighth birthday is celebrated today that their father committed suicide on exactly the same occasion by jumping from the top of a high chimney onto the flagstones of a terrace behind the family estate. Perverse and morbid if not even worse than morbid. With a suicide note supposedly signed by the elder son, Nicholas or Nick, saying ""Like my father before me, I choose eternal sleep."" Note this suicide note is slightly bizarre because of the present tense directed at Nicholas himself in the game. But it is supposed to be read after the death of the suicidee, and that is hyper important for the suicidee who would use the preterit, the past if you prefer, because he is before committing his suicide projecting himself mentally into what is going to happen after his suicide is in the past. And in the past, it would even be worse because the effect would be multiplied on Nicholas since it might mean for Nicholas in the game he is dead. This rivalry is enacted to the very end of the game: harsh confrontation of the two brothers in the night in some San Francisco street stairs; the ""accidental"" killing of Conrad, the younger brother, by Nicholas on the roof of the skyscraper from which he is going to jump (or he would have been thrown over by one actor, if he had not jumped by himself), reenacting his father's own suicide; and the new confrontation of the two after Conrad's rebirth, resurrection and Nicholas great fall like some Humpty Dumpty. The last touch on the two brothers will be some kind of reconciliation when Nicholas suggests sharing the bill and Conrad accepts. <br/><br/>So far that is banal and that would only make a good psychological melodrama, a drama with a good ending. But it is so much more.<br/><br/>First, it is a game but the game is played in the real world with real means and with as little visible cheating as possible. All the bullets have been changed to blanks, though the gun Nicholas uses is from the ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" copy hiding a very powerful handgun (at the top of the library in the family estate), and at the end the actress playing Christine will have to convince Nicholas that his gun has real bullets whereas all the other guns used in the game only had blanks. This is slightly hard to believe for us because the shooting of a gun from the game punctures a tire in one of the chasing episodes, and the machine guns, or so, used by the CRS posse when they try to neutralize him when he gets berserk at Christine's do make many holes in the setting. Of course, it is nothing but a cinema scene, so everything is fake but in the film, it is a real situation that probably explains the price of the game because of all the hundreds of bullets holes that have to be exploded artificially to make Nicholas believe the CRS agents are using real bullets. We, of course, can see the treachery at every corner in that labyrinthine plot, but Nicholas is not supposed to see it though at times it is slightly too obvious. Some scenes are even comical and emphasized as such by some comment from Nicholas like ""Dinner for two, please"" when Christine and Nicholas emerge from the two dumpsters behind a Chinese restaurant. As some would say, too good to be true.<br/><br/>Second, we are projected into a world where crazy adventures can happen virtually but as if they were real. The film is a metaphor for virtual reality and games in that virtual world, virtual reality games that are so true that we believe they are real life. What is surprising is that several times, often to save their skins, some actors reveal it is a game, to the point that Nicholas believes it and wants to step out, to pull the curtain, to stop the game. . .

It revealed that pretty much whatever choices he made there was a plan for it. For instance it showed there were divers and people ready to save him if he didn't manage to get out of the taxi underwater and that there were safety balloons on all sides of the building etc. There absence from the cut i saw totally ruined it for me and especially my girl as it just made her say at the end ""what if he'd done this, what if he'd done that"" The cut i saw showed you exactly that. This cut version just makes it seem totally based on chance and therefore stupid and contrived. Someone please tell me i'm not going mad and they have seen this version i have.

"oOoBarracuda","4","1","2","3 May 2017"," The Game
","David Fincher is a highly celebrated modern director responsible for a few modern-day classics, as well as the 1997 film, The Game. Fincher is one that I have struggled with. Some of his films make it easy to see their greatness, while others seem overrated, to me. The Game starring Michael Douglas as a rich investment banker looking for a break from his life shows interest in a mysterious game his brother informs him about. A mystery folded within an exercise in personal revelation, The Game never quite delivers on either message it promises. <br/><br/>Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a wealthy investment banker living in San Fransisco who enjoys his time alone more than he enjoys crowding his life with an abundance of people. He has even become rather estranged from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn). When Conrad tells his brother about an unusual game he can play, then gives him a gift certificate to partake in the game for a birthday present, Nicholas is intrigued. Nicholas is constantly haunted by memories of his father's suicide, and these flashbacks have intensified the closer it gets to Nicholas's 48th birthday, as that was the year his father ended his life. Seeking a refuge from his life and the constant flashbacks, Nicholas begins to investigate taking part in the game. Almost immediately after his entry to the game, Nicholas endures trauma and troubles in every aspect of his life. His professional life, his personal life, and even his safety have all become uncertain as the lines between reality and the game become too vague to discern.<br/><br/>The Game presented a unique premise but perhaps was a bit too far- fetched. The elaborate measures one endures while taking part in the game, up to and including being abandoned for dead in Mexico yet unable to trace, beg for more than a suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience member. The film also has a serious pacing problem. Tightening up the narrative and reducing the run time by about 30 minutes would have been a great benefit to the audience. The film really starts to slog about just after the halfway point, becoming easy for one to lose both interest and intrigue. I read a reading of the film that presents it as a modern-day retelling of A Christmas Carol. I have difficulties with this reading because there is not enough establishment of Douglas's character as a bad person before he starts playing the game. Scrooge, in A Christmas Carol, is quite obviously a curmudgeonly fellow, obsessed with profits and his own gain. Douglas's Nicholas, however, comes off as a man successful in his field who appears broken by the looming memories of his father's death. Without a clear identity of Douglas as a man we are supposed to dislike due to his business practices, it's difficult to watch his livelihood taken away from him due to a sick game. I came off disliking the seemingly heroic Conrad than I ever disliked Nicholas. The Game falters on its premise and suffers from too little establishment of what is apparently supposed to be an unlikeable character, which is a unique problem in a film in which pacing is such a slog."

I even have a co worker who went to see this film in a movie theater. I am going to say it again I love this film to death and I love Michael Douglas! <br/><br/>""I'm being toyed with by a bunch of depraved children..."" <br/><br/>Plot: Wealthy San Francisco financier Nicholas Van Orton gets a strange birthday present from wayward brother Conrad: a live-action game that consumes his life.<br/><br/>THERE ARE NO RULES IN THE GAME. And that will make life very difficult for Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas). a successful businessman who is always in control. Van Orton lives a well-ordered life - until an unexpected birthday gift from his brother (Sean Penn) destroys it all. Van Orton has been enrolled in a game - ""a profound life experience"" - that begins quietly enough but soon erupts in a rush of devastating and bizarre events. Like it or not, he must either win the game or lose control of everything in his life.<br/><br/>The movie is a mystery about a game from a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) it is a game like a vacation for holidays, just the vacation comes to you. This is a birthday gift from Connie (Sean Penn) to his brother Nicholas (Michael Douglas). When the game starts you keep thinking this is for real and people are really trying to kill Nicholas to get his money. First they screwed up his brother and now they want to screw him over.<br/><br/>This is very, very well directed thriller and Michael Douglas best performance ever. I found the ending to be brilliant and makes sense. Deborah Kara Unger was extremely gorgeous and very hot sexy babe! I was even in love with her after seeing her in this movie. The scene in which protagonist Van Orton finds a life-size clown doll in his driveway was ranked #44 on Bravo's list of The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.<br/><br/>For a David Fincher fan like myself, there are movies that I actually like they are: Se7en, Zodiac and of course Panic Room (2002) this was the film I went to see it in the movie theater in June 2002, when it was by us released in Slovenia it was actually the first Jodie Foster film I saw in a movie theater. But The Game will always be my favorite David Fincher film and Michael Douglas's third favorite film. I also do think this movie is very underrated and some people don't like it. Well I don't like Fight Club and I am probably the only one , but The Game I love to death. I heard years ago that Michael Douglas had a fun making this film with David Fincher and he would love to do another thriller with Fincher again, if Fincher would offer him another movie role.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film is with the taxi cab when the taxi driver leaves him alone the car and the car drives on the pier in the water and Nicholas open's the window with that hook he received for the game package. I love when operatives of CRS are using suppressed Heckler & Koch MP5K's automatic machine gun to shoot the apartment of Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) and opens fire on Nicholas. Nicholas leaps off the skyscraper and crashes through a glass ceiling, but he lands safely in an airbag. There he finds his family and friends awaiting his arrival and The Game is revealed to have just been a game. The accounts have not been drained, the gun was replaced with one firing blanks, and his brother is alive.<br/><br/>I am giving this film a perfect 10 out of 10 which I do believe is a classic David Fincher's underrated psychological best mystery thriller. Mine favorite Michael Douglas film of all time I love it! <br/><br/>The Game is a 1997 American mystery thriller film directed by David Fincher, starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, and produced by Propaganda Films and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It tells the story of a wealthy investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his everyday life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.<br/><br/>10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Studio: PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Universal Studios Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, Peter Donat, Carroll Baker, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Anna Katarina, Charles Martinet Director: David Fincher Producers: Steve Golin, CeÃ¡n Chaffin Screenplay: John Brancato and Michael Ferris Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hr. 9 Mins.

","Yesterday I watched a movie that I hadn't seen in 19 years so I decided to watch another movie that I hadn't seen in about as long. Whereas the other movie was worse than I remembered, ""The Game"" was better than I remembered.<br/><br/>Before the morbid movie ""Saw"" put chosen people through an orchestrated ""game"" of sorts there was ""The Game"". Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker out of San Francisco. He's arrogant, rude and cutthroat--many of the qualities needed to be a successful businessman--but he's also lonely. On his 48th birthday his brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), gave him a gift of a ""game"" set up by CRS (Consumer Recreation Services). The ""game"" was no game at all to Nicholas, it was real.<br/><br/>I liked the fact they made Nicholas realistic. In other words, he wasn't a raging a-hole. They didn't make his character so over the top that you thoroughly hated him. He was a businessman that had standards. He wanted things done a certain way and he expected them done the way he wanted. He never made a scene to humiliate anyone or belittle anyone. He was subtle but his point was made. In that sense we weren't set up for some major conversion ala Scrooge.<br/><br/>The game he got involved in was elaborate. Maybe that would be the only real knock against the movie: just how elaborate the game was. It involved dozens of participants, series of misdirection and even some near death moments. It was so elaborate it bordered on extreme.<br/><br/>Besides that nuance I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it today just like I did, ahem... years ago."

","This movie hooked me from the beginning.<br/><br/>The first minutes are not spectacular, but really atmospheric and disquieting.<br/><br/>This is my favorite Michael Douglas performance along with ""Falling Down"". He portraits a nasty businessman who does not care about anyone but himself. At first you hate the character, but then you start to empathize with him . Anyway, his attitude will be ""rewarded""... The way in which will be rewarded this attitude, is the point of the movie. And this way is surprising and original. Even if you guess the end of the movie, or you think is predictable, it is still original.<br/><br/>I want to highlight the presence of Deborah Kara Unger (Crash), who has a remarkable performance in the film.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Literally unbelievable, gets you tricked from start to finish, impossible to expect what is going to happen, extravagant ending! Every scene is important in the the story, no filler shots. Each time you watch it you are going to see something yet unseen, but the movie itself is not worth watching more than once, since when you know the huge surprise effect of the film, it is not going to be exciting for you watching it again.<br/><br/>Just when you think you got the plot right it turns around again and you have no clue what is about to happen next, that is the most intriguing part of this movie. Nicholas Van Orton gets a chance to get away from his monotone life, he is extremely wealthy, but never gets to experience anything fun or adventurous, well i would not say i found all the troubles he went through fun, but it is a clever way of showing how being rich is not everything.<br/><br/>Great acting, very intense, keeps you on your toes throughout, easy to sit through without getting bored. Definitely worth seeing once!"
"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","11 October 2015"," That ending though...
","Now I wouldn't be surprised if the director for ""Saw"" got some of his idea from this movie. Now the main reason I wanted to check this movie out is because it's directed by David Fincher. The guy is just meticulous and entertaining when it comes to the thriller genre. Now I like watching movies that revolve around a test or some sort of a game the characters need to overcome and the trials they need to face. As long as it's done in a innovative, immersive, interesting and entertaining to watch approach. Now I am not picky to the point to say it must have a high level grades in these aspects. But good enough to keep me invested to what is going to happen next and how they are going to go about it. So in that department, ""The Game"" works. So the plot is about a emotionally distant and selfish business man played by Michael Douglas. Entering a program called CRS as a gift from his younger brother for his 48th birthday. Weird and negative stuff that doesn't make much sense starts to happen to him. The constant guessing and trying to figure out what exactly is going on is the main drive going for this movie. If the movie was a bit more clever and had Michael Douglas trying to fit the puzzle together and you follow along with that. It might have been more interesting though. The movie had my attention most of the way through, but it also got a bit boring a few times. But knew when to pick it up by adding twists and turns or something cool just when my attention to the story started to run out. Plus David Fincher is really good at putting in that odd mysterious elements. Where you as an audience can't help but feel that something is off. So the build up is quite good, but the ending. Now the ending was pretty darn far-fetched. Besides that it's a pretty cool thriller that is worth checking out.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The Game (1997): Dir: David Fincher / Cast: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn, Armin Mueller-Stahl: Jigsaw puzzle thriller that exercises the mind with extreme implausibility. Title refers to mind play as well as an operation called C.R.S (Consumer Recreation Services). Michael Douglas reluctantly joins but instead of a relaxing vacation he is faced with a night of pure mayhem. C.R.S appears to be watching him but their building is vacant upon his return. His home has been bugged and mysterious strangers enter his life all of whom carry a piece of the puzzle. Douglas discovers that he cannot trust anyone. Stylish directing by David Fincher who previously scored big with Seven, another film about manipulation and accepting fate as is. Douglas is excellent as a wealthy man brought down only to learn a huge lesson in a surprise twist ending. Sean Penn is fine as his brother who ends up becoming involved in this scheme. Deborah Kara Unger plays a waitress whom Douglas is instructed to follow. James Rebhorn has a bit part as a C.R.S head whom Douglas will face down before revelations are met. Armin Mueller-Stahl plays a business associate whom Douglas suspects is behind the whole charade. Spectacular film about letting go with a vacation that is too good to be true and too horrifying to be ignored. It simply must be complied with. Score: 9 / 10"

","This film tells how Nicholas Van Orton, a smug and cold millionaire, enters a bizarre and unique game that promises to play with his life. But when the game starts and Nicholas sees the twisted and perverse way unfolds, things start getting out of control. Directed by David Fincher (director of the film ""Seven""), features Michael Douglas as protagonist.<br/><br/>The truly wealthy have always had a reputation for being arrogant people, cold, impersonal, smug and only concerned about themselves and their business. Nicholas Van Orton was like that, even disregarding his own brother. And it is from him that Nicholas receives a different birthday gift: participation in a game organized by a mysterious company that everyone seems to know but about which nothing is said nowhere. Intrigued but afraid, Nicholas boards the game without real sense of where he is in, which says a lot about the personality of some rich people. The film will thicken up gradually, leaving the audience in anticipation and securing it constantly. It is an addictive movie where Douglas shows all its value and can brilliantly interpret your character. All this makes this film an excellent thriller, perhaps one of the best of the late twentieth century."

","Wealthy San Francisco financier Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) gets a strange birthday present from wayward brother Conrad (Sean Penn): a live-action game that consumes his life.<br/><br/>This is a strange film, and one that is hard to follow at times because it is so unexpected. One could rightly call it two hours of red herrings. Never get too attached to any characters or scenes, because they could change or disappear at any time. Is this a strength or a weakness? <br/><br/>What strikes me is that this film was picked up by Criterion. Not saying it did not deserve their attention, but it is a bit unusual. The movie is not old, foreign, independent... it is not a movie that slipped under the radar (though it is not as well-remembered today as some of Fincher's other films). Well played, Criterion."
"videorama-759-859391","8","1","2","5 March 2014"," Live a little. Place the game
","It's no surprise, this film, with it's originality of story, is steered by Se7en director David Fincher, though really at the time it was a low profile movie that came and went, hitting the video shelves within months that followed. Douglas of course fits this role, as a sour, bitter, ex divorcée, who lives a life of riches, as an investment banker, or something like that, with a great spread, and has just turned 48. His younger, coke dependant, mentally troubled brother (Penn, in good form) who like other people, close, who have been shunned away from him, gives him a gift, and thus what begins, becomes one living nightmare after the next. He's given this voucher for a mind and health improvement facility, called Consumer Recreational Services, where based on many questions and analysis's, improves that life of the person (player) who partakes in the test. I mean, really what do you give for the man who has everything. Okay, I will admit this movie is very far fetched, but there's a message there too. We see a little bit, how the Douglas character has became the way he is when witness to his father's suicide as a kid, in light coloured sepia tones of flashback done, in of fast motion, that are pretty cool, and creative. The character Douglas creates, that of Nicholas Van Orton, is one of longing fascination. He's an angry and one might say, though not really knowing him, intimately, grudgeful guy, but one thing of certitude, is that, he's not happy, or content. At the end of the film, we learn how the real game is played, as though one big joke has been played on us through the entirety of the movie, as Douglas too, but it's an exciting and maddening ride getting there. The jump scene and landing, like the one in Lethal Weapon, here, more spectacular, is just another far fetched moment, which has you asking, ""How can an ending like this exist?"" but for this film, it works. Douglas, who's never played it more straighter or stricter, and the shaky, fidgety character of Penn are two other reasons, apart from the film's originality to check this low profile, but ""goodie"" pic out. Not as good as Seven, but who's judging."
"jessejedi","8","1","2","19 October 2013"," Thrilling, Exciting, Attention Grasping until just before the end
","This movie is the first movie I have seen in a long time, and I saw it at home on the TV. The opening scenes and music lead me to think of it as a horror film with the playback of memory slides, and the quite mysterious music at the background. However, as the movie progresses, I quickly abandoned the idea of being a complete horror movie, but with the mysterious music playing throughout the film, I have to keep the idea that it is at least a thriller.<br/><br/>The movie did not disappoint me. My attention was completely focused on the movie trying to not miss a scene. I did not try to solve it, I simply sat and tried to let the movie take me away. And I recommend that you watch it in that way too as that is the best way to experience any movie.<br/><br/>I once tried to confirm to myself that everything happened is just a game. But there are so many scenes that happened that try to smash this idea. The cab into the water, any slower reaction, and Nicholas could really be drowned in the water. The shootings (without even guessing that it is loaded with planks) that I thought could have killed Nicholas. The ""confession"" made by ""Christine"" when Nicholas was drugged. There are so many risky places that could lead to an early end to the game. For example, what will happen if Nicholas decided to not follow Christine and let the ""cops"" coming from the CRS car to arrest him? What would happen if the planks shot him before he could get away from so many scenes? What would happen if Nicholas (at a very small chance) tries to expose his experience to the public? Just to give myself an explanation, I guess I can say things happened the way they were, and hence they worked. But those are exactly what caused the plot- twists of the movie -- to let you think that it is, and let you think again that maybe it is not.<br/><br/>I give the movie only 8 points because I think the end, the final twist, happened too fast. Assuming the gun from the book is really under control as well and it is loaded with planks, there are still a number of questions I have.<br/><br/>First of all, assume the CRS guessed that Nicholas would open fire under such pressure, why is the back of Conrad's shirt also dyed with blood? I cannot find a proper reason why would the back also contain a blood pack even though that did make it realistic if Nicholas were to check Conrad's back right after Nicholas shot him. But I think the chance of Nicholas shoots Conrad, goes up to the body to examine, and flips Conrad over to check the back as well, is too low. The fact that Nicholas did not check Conrad's ""body"", but they still showed Conrad's back of the shirt have the blood pack is quite intriguing.<br/><br/>Secondly, the guy said he would have pushed Nicholas down the building if he didn't jump himself. It seemed like a nice add-on to have, but having Nicholas drop from that high, I can only say it is lucky that he fell back first onto the lights. If he fell face first, god knows what may happen to him. Also what if he jumped from the other two sides? Maybe that place only has one side?<br/><br/>Thirdly, with both the top two ignored, the turn at the end happened way too quickly. One minute before we are grasping at the death of Nicholas, and the next minute a party begins. It explains it well, but I find it hard to accept. If it were to happen a little slower with a few more transition I would find it more pleasurable.<br/><br/>With all that being said, I will give the movie 10 out of 10 if not I don't think the ending is wrapped up careful enough."
"ElMaruecan82","9","1","2","20 September 2012"," Sometimes heart-warming, sometimes heart-breaking ... always heart-pounding ...
","It's possible that ""The Game"" asks too much on the ""suspension of disbelief"" department, maybe it would be nearly implausible to come up with such a well-crafted, meticulous, and high-scale prank without an incident, that no hazardous ""what if"" could have made the whole plot fall down, maybe.<br/><br/>Yet it's nearly impossible not be thrilled by David Fincher's ""The Game"" a film elevated above all the conventions of the action genre thanks to its inventive premise and Michael Douglas' central performance, both are strongly connected anyway. Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, and as the 'Van' clearly indicates, he's a rich and influent man. He's also one of these miserable loners leaving not much to envy, celebrating his 48th with one hamburger, a cupcake with one candle, and watching CNN on a big sofa, in a vast mansion where he lives alone, divorced and totally passionless. Acting as cold-hearted tyrant with his employees and servants, he strikes as a man who trusts no one and needs to keep things under his control.<br/><br/>Only Douglas can make the alienating effect of excessive respectability and a sense of desperate misery coexist within the same character. A living paradox, Nicholas Van Orton is like a combo of Gordon Gekko and D-Fens. Yet, the film alternates between scenes where he vents his anger on his entourage and childhood flashbacks. Nicholas' father committed suicide when he was 48 and it surely affected Nicholas for the rest of his life. How do we know? Well, the script wouldn't have bothered to show it right in the beginning otherwise. If it was revealed later in the middle of the life-changing process, we'd have known that Nicholas could change. But we have to know the wound in his heart from the beginning, to understand that not only he can change, but needs to change.<br/><br/>His brother Conrad (Sean Penn) is a more optimistic and down-to-earth character: his name-code to reach Nicholas is Seymour Butts and his gift to Conrad is no less original, a sort of game provided by CRS, a Consumer Recreation Services. The game is a life-changing experience combining fun and self-improvement, two things that cruelly lack in Nicholas' life. Visibly intrigued but not really enthusiastic, Nicholas promises to give a try. Coincidentally, he finds himself near the CRS' new headquarters and hears people talking about it. As one of the managers, played by the90's ultimate character-actor James Hebhorn says, ""it's the 'game that comes to you"" and we sure had a glimpse. Nicholas is invited to forget his suspicion, to admit he's intrigued (and that's a clever wink to the audience by the screenplay) and that he's got nothing to lose, except one or two hours of medical and psychological tests, that would last longer naturally.<br/><br/>It's so enjoyable to watch a control freak like character like Van Orton, pushed in weird to uncontrollable situations, gradually building the suspense. As soon as the game starts, it's a long descent into one of the most nightmarish cinematic experiences, driven by the growing conviction that anything, a waiter, a taxi cab, a cop, a man sitting in front of you, is part of it. What would you expect when even a TV anchorman talks to you or when you're lured into drinking a poisoned coffee by a woman who was not supposed to be part of the game? The paranoid feeling is efficiently conveyed by Fincher's directing, by borrowing some aspects from ""Seven"", it does show a more shadowy and menacing face of San Francisco, and the film owes a lot to the subtle yet powerful performance by Douglas that puts us directly in his shoes..<br/><br/>Yet as promising as the idea of a game that puts a client on one deadly situation after another sounds, the film couldn't have handled it for a 2-hour runtime. Indeed, even if ""The Game"" expects a final twist, it has to mislead the viewer. After all, if a film is supposed to reveal that the bad guy is A, you have to suspect B and by personal deduction. The same goes with ""The Game"" and proves Fincher's special talent to handle twist endings. If we take into consideration that Van Orton is a wealthy man, and that the whole game is a scheme to steal his money, then everything makes perfect sense. The script hooks us to this certitude until the end, where we realize that it was indeed a game that went wrong  enough to turn out to be successful. Believing that he accidentally killed his brother, Nicholas jumps off a high building and land in the right spot, on an inflated lifesaving cushion. The game is over and all the protagonists are here for a last 'Gotcha!'.<br/><br/>This part is hard to believe for movie purists, but what would they have expected anyway? If you admit that CRS was always one step ahead of Van Orton, and could have predicted his reactions from his tests, if not believable, it seems plausible. Besides, it makes a whole sense to the character's arc, he had to be lonely man who had no other choice than being the way he was after his father's death, , to experience the same act of despair and realize that there's much to life than drowning his past on sad memories, when he opens his eyes, he's given a second chance. It's simple, believable, but the script if not a masterpiece of sophistication, is well-constructed enough to deliver what we'd expect and Douglas' performance turned it into something even more emotionally challenging.<br/><br/>The film started with a man celebrating his birthday alone, and ends up with the same man celebrating his rebirth with all the people that count in his life. And in between, it's all suspense, thrills and mystery, what can you ask for more?"
"LeonLouisRicci","5","1","2","13 July 2012"," You Won...But You Cheated
","This is a very hard movie to like. It is so manipulative that it's hard to suspend disbelief. After it is over you feel that your opponent has won the game, but had to cheat to do it.<br/><br/>It is played out in a back and forth ""game"" of...they are playing with me and now they are playing against me...no wait, they have played the game and its over and we just don't know it...no wait, maybe...it all just gets to be overwhelming.<br/><br/>It is too clever for its own good and has a few too many plot twists to sustain and it all comes down to an overloaded, bloated, confusing letdown."
"ColtGanloso","8","1","2","17 April 2012"," Fincher Fans Only.
","Following ""Se7en"" was never going to be an easy task & in comparison to that masterwork ""The Game"" was always going to feel a little underwhelming, but by no means is it without merit: Visually, it is excellent (As with all Fincher movies) colour is drained from the screen giving it an almost sepia feel. As with the visuals, the score is minimal - and used to great effect - creating suspense & an unsettling quality a la ""Se7en"" & ""Zodiac"" but while there is much to savour and admire; ultimately - this film lacks any real substance.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film, Michael Douglas' rather unlikable character states that he wants to ""look behind the curtain"" unfortunately, there isn't much there, the ""Is it a game, or is it real?"" scenario has been done much better in other movies & credulity is stretched to breaking point; on repeated viewings things just don't add up. The less said about the ridiculous ending, the better.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I would recommend ""The Game"" one can file it under ""Interesting misfire"" as it lacks the depth & overall satisfying conclusion of a ""Se7en"" or ""Fight Club"" but for Fincher fans, there is much to enjoy here."
"hammerstacey51","7","1","2","3 March 2012"," Solid Douglas Performance
","The reason to watch this movie was Michael Douglas (Nicholas Von Orton) and no problem there as he made a very strong performance throughout. He just doesn't know what's going on as I didn't. Every 10 minutes the story gets a twist and says that all things previously seen are fake, now is the moment of the truth. Then in another ten minutes, again and again and again. In fact, in the end I got a bit tired of this and the constant change was not so entertaining. I watched the last 20 minutes only for sake of curiosity, to know what will be the final solution, which was original indeed. I think less twist would have been more, with more development of Nicholas' character, description of the plots. That way it would worth a second watch for me, this way it was just a fast moving funny action movie.<br/><br/>About the idea of 'The Game' - funnily the movie started me to think after a bit - this whole idea is so strange for me. First, it is so awkward that you need hundreds of people and millions of dollars and an incredibly strong impact on your personality to make you a shock and discover 'where life is' and come back to reality. Second, when you constantly discover, that everything previously experienced was a setup, when you showed true emotions and reactions others were just playing around you, when killing your brother was a fake and even your own suicide was a fake - then I think to loose ground and simply my personality would crash. I would no longer be able to trust anyone and any experience because I would constantly doubt whether this is part of a setup or is this 'real'. Authenticity is very important to me in my personal relations, and when someone plays with emotions and trust, all I can do is to let my walls fall build up suddenly, put on my mask, and keep all authentic feelings and reactions inside, and just give a smile to The outer world. Living such a way for a long time would be really a nightmare for me.<br/><br/>However, I like the idea of Mother Theresa and Sai Baba, who said ""Life is a game. Play it."" - though the words are similar, somehow that is such a different approach to life than what is presented in the movie ""The Game""."

His luxurious, routine and also boring life took a drastic turn when he enrolled himself in a 'game',which was given to him by Conrad as a Birthday gift.<br/><br/>From that moment, the movie revolves to show erroneous events occurring.

"son_of_cheese_messiah","6","1","2","8 April 2011"," Contrived sadistic thriller
","I can't decide whether I find the premise of this film interesting or merely silly. No doubt if such an idea had occurred in the golden age of Hollywood, the life changing adventure would have been exotic travel, secret agents and romance. This being the modern age, however, the hero must endure a harrowing ordeal for enlightenment. In this sense it anticipates films such as SAW where likewise a dubious piece of cod psychology is used to justify a series of sadistic events, so the audience can safely watch. The idea that undergoing a series of horrific events is life-affirming is as ridiculous as the notion that undergoing gang rape is sexually liberating (we still await this to become a thinly veiled excuse for a plot, but surely it will in the near future).<br/><br/>The audience is swept along by all this as it happens. Indeed, the events are so extreme that it is hard to believe that this is merely a game. The hero (Nicholas, played well by Michael Douglas) is subjected to a potential drowning, buried in a Mexican graveyard and forced to shoot his own brother (Sean Penn) dead. This drives Nicholas to a state of despair so that he hurls himself off the top of building in a suicide bid which emulates the manner in which his father died, at the same age. Surely even someone with a cursory knowledge of human mind will realise that this will not do anyone's long term mental health any good, even with the fig leaf of psychological profiling? <br/><br/>It is only at the denouement that a sense of dissatisfaction and audience manipulation kicks in. The plot is deeply contrived and contains a huge amount of x-factors which no psychological tests could predict. Bullets can easily be faked, but that does not explain how Nicholas could have been guaranteed to overcome the many dangerous situations into which he is placed. The jump into the skip, for instance, could have easily ended in a broken neck. Would a wheelchair bound Nicholas said to his brother ""Thank you for your birthday present""? The escape from the sinking car was even more hazardous. Had he died would the company have said ""whoops""? This is to say nothing to the death dive at the end. Yet all this is greeted with a ""thank you"" a piece of glibness which is remarkable."

","I was really stunned by the screenplay. This is my first ever review about a movie and this movie compelled me to write a review. I just liked it a lot, it has a lot of surprises in it. But for sure you will feel the surprise only for the first time, you can enjoy it only once. So I advice the users not to read the plot of the movie before you watch it. Its a better thriller and surprise. And I was expecting another twist in the end, like a negative ending or something. It would be a big big problem if companies like CRS exists. Now I became a hardcore fan of David Fincher. I felt the casting was also perfect, everybody did their job amazingly well in the movie as well as in the Game! I could say that this movie is ""A Twister of Twisters"". I really got obsessed with this movie and for sure I am going to annoy my friends at least for a week with this movie's story line! Now I just got a big list of Fincher's movie and am gonna watch them all and enjoy. Guys this is an awesome movie, just go ahead and enjoy the movie."

","In short, very few movies have made my heart sink to a low that makes me feel like there's been a heavy weight added to it, shout out going to Kelly in Ohio at this point. There are movies with a twist which usually brings the viewer back to reality or that reveal a secret meaning to what's gone before. Unfortunately for me, the twist in this one will be leading me to an early grave, not due to the quality of the acting which was as always 'adequate' Douglas, but simply due to the fact, how do you create a meaningful twist out of such a twisted movie? The answer is you can't! <br/><br/>This movie is not one to watch alone, not one to watch with the family, nor the Mrs's or dare i say it with friends, which leads me to the conclusion that this movie is one for the dogs."
"ruffinelli_ro","9","1","2","3 April 2009"," One good movie
","I have seen many movies with many twists before. But none of them were like this one. With what I think is one of Michael Douglas' best performances, this movie takes you into a spiral of things that doesn't make much sense at first but are really clear in the end (I said that in the good way). The rest of the cast was great also. They helped a lot in setting that odd mood. The movie shows us a strange place filled with bizarre people.<br/><br/>Fincher's work is really great and is definitely worth watching. I can assure that 3 or 4 of his films will be included in your all time favorites. He does his job like nobody else can. Each film is unique, and different from what we are use to see. So give this and most of his movies a try."

","David Fincher follows up ""Seven"", the by ""The Silence of The Lambs"" influenced thriller that broke out of genre conventions and subsequently became the second most influential thriller of the nineties, with another puzzler. ""The Game"" lays it's cards out in plain sight from the get-go: figuring out the object of the game is the game. Which doubles the fun if Fincher's smoke and mirrors fool you. <br/><br/>When his unkempt brother Conrad (Sean Penn) first tries to warm him up for the idea of actually participating in ""The Game"", Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), aggravated, says 'he hates surprises'. Conrad pleads: 'It's a profound life experience'; prompting Nicholas to reply: 'Like a stroke?'. Fools speak the truth when they're joking. Van Orton soon finds himself in a roller-coaster with no seat belts, and he forcibly comes to an insight when the cart plummets into the abyss.<br/><br/>If there is such a category, I'd put ""The Game"" in with escapist thrillers: pretension-less, fun, keep-you-guessing films with twists as a goal onto itself. Therefore, people shouldn't stumble over the improbabilities in the plot. It's like reading Jim Thompson, a man who does not know the meaning of the word restraint as far as hardboiled characters and plot u-turns go.<br/><br/>Fincher directs straightforward thrillers with such a sleight of hand, I can think of no contemporary directors who can match his skills in the genre. Cinematographically, ""The Game"" was well ahead of it's time. It seems DP Harris Savides and Fincher make a great team: they also collaborated on ""Zodiac"". Both films' night time scenes take my breath away. Add three time Academy Award winning composer Howard Shore into the mix and what you get is a very effective psychological thriller."

","Nicholas Van Orton is a very wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is an absolute loner, even spending his birthday alone. In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide) his brother Conrad, who has gone long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, suddenly returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird and bad things start to happen to him.<br/><br/>If I had to pick one thing out of this movie that would have people talking for days or even months, or why the movie is talked about so many times (I assume, when it came out) was because of the ending. The TWIST ending. You're thinking it's just another twist ending, right? WRONG. This ending would either make you HATE the movie or LOVE the movie. At first, I didn't like it, or better phrased, I didn't get used to it. I may suggest people to see this movie more than once to get used to the ending because it's going to be stuck in your throat for quite awhile.<br/><br/>So what's so controversial about this twist ending? I don't know. Well, I do know but you have to find out for yourself. I'm not going to ruin the surprise. I've probably build it so much that you're wanting to watch this movie already. I'm sorry I did that. Let's get back on topic. What I loved about the movie, after seeing it for the second time and after I got used to what I just saw, I loved the twist ending because it provides a moral. Yes, indeed the ending provides a moral, much along like a fairy tale story. It's like loving ""Citizen Kane"" because of its ending.<br/><br/>However, the whole movie was very ingenious. Very unpredictable, I must add. This may be even one of the most unpredictable movie you'll ever see in your life! *sigh* OK. This movie will sure make you think a lot. Before I continue, I literally thought about this movie in my sleep the day I saw it. I was still thinking about it when I woke up. That's how great this movie is! It's one of those movies that will have people talking for days and days! OK, well, the first few minutes of the film really pulled me in. I was intrigued. VERY intrigued.<br/><br/>However, there came a point when the movie did lose its steam. It's when Deborah Kara Unger comes in. Now, I would've just preferred her to not be part of this movie or, better yet, not come as early into the film because I liked Sean Penn playing the game by himself and not with a partner. That's just me, though.<br/><br/>But overall, I loved the plot for the film and it did keep me guessing from beginning to end. My mind was literally blank. I love the whole puzzle feeling from the film. It gives you one piece at a time until the ending where it puts all of the pieces together. It was really great to have seen this movie. It gives us an important lesson (but I'm not going to say a thing) and this thriller is just that unpredictable that you can't believe it!"

"UlrikSander","7","1","2","14 September 2006"," Unique David Fincher thriller gem
","David Fincher is a master of establishing atmosphere and mood as demonstrated in the White Rabbit sequence. A stumbling, moody, and almost tickling piano score underlines Nicolas Van Orton's (Michael Douglas) delusional mind-state. Douglas is acceptable as the main-character, although somewhat anonymous. That is a good thing! We are supposed to accept this guy as just another guy from the multi-millionaires' club. Sean Penn over-acts as Nicolas' brother Conrad, playing it very paranoid, but there is no question it works.<br/><br/>It is interesting how the movie is constructed so that the audience's mind-state follows Nicolas' mind-state. We develop paranoia in the exact pace he does! When Nicolas believes CRS are after him, we believe it. When he thinks it is a game, we think it. When he doesn't - we don't. Consequentially we are not convinced that it is just a game until the plot-twist end.<br/><br/>""The Game"" is, however, not perfect. The last five minutes are mostly unnecessary. It is such a shame David Fincher didn't have the guts to pull off an open ending. The current one leaves no room for further interpreting. An open ending would have left the movie running in the mind of the viewer long afterward.<br/><br/>Its flaws aside, ""The Game"" is a very successful thriller that should appeal to everyone."

"nycritic","8","1","2","18 February 2006"," Let's Toast the Man Who Has Everything
","Hot on the heels of his breakthrough success with 1995's SE7EN David Fincher, at that moment Hollywood's new It director, went one step further into the darkness within an everyman's life with this twisting refrigerator movie that tells the story of ""the man who had everything"", Nicholas Van Orton, who gets a special gift from his tricky brother Conrad (Sean Penn). This gift is a ""game"" which a company named Consumer Recreation Services provides ""whatever the customer lacks"" in entertainment. Nicholas, a humorless man, reverts to his old life -- until odd incidents begin to manifest themselves, growing in severity until he realizes that this is not a game and his very life is threatened.<br/><br/>With conscious nods to NORTH BY NORTHWEST and SECONDS, THE GAME is an underground contemporary classic that lets us is on the perverse pleasure of being mean to someone and seeing their cold veneer and control-freak nature crumble under pressure. David Fincher knows suspense and how to tighten the noose around his main character and he throws all the stops out, like the Wizard behind the curtain in THE WIZARD OF OZ. He loves making even the most seasoned film-buff try and second guess the plot, only to throw a monkey wrench into the proceedings. Not much else can be said about the supporting actors (Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger) without giving crucial elements away, but it's enough to say they're both fine as wine. Penn is playful, but a loving brother; Unger is smoldering like the best of femme fatales. Michael Douglas, however, is an actor used to this kind of role -- the persecuted Everyman -- and it's great fun to watch his control give away to frantic desperation as he breaks through that fourth wall to reveal who is hiding behind that green curtain."
"paul2001sw-1","9","1","2","7 March 2004"," High Class Hokum
","'The Game' is the sort of film that Hollywood does best.  Michael Douglas plays Nicholas van Orton, a wealthy banker whose brother (Sean Penn) signs him up for a real-life game.  When the game proves not to be too much fun, and van Orton finds himself unable to stop it, the question of where the game begins and reality begins is not easily answered.  Director Fincher handles this material adroitly, ratcheting up the tension as van Orton fins himself in ever deeper trouble - but it's also very funny, the plot is preposterous, but enacted with such conviction that it keeps you gripped, even as you laugh at its sheer outrageousness.  Full marks must go to Douglas (a natural in the role), Penn (playing uncharacteristically nerdy) and Deborah Unger, excellent as a tough and sexy femme fatale.<br/><br/>Fincher's films all seem to have a similar quality, films that dare you to take them seriously but which ultimately make fun of you if you do.  'Se7en' is senseless in terms of the motivation of its characters - 'Fight Club' appears at first to be a study of modern masculinity, but turns out to be just a very clever joke.  The key is to enjoy the joke, and the ride, at the same time - and in enabling the viewer to do this, 'The Game' is perhaps his most successful (and least pretentious) work.  I was riveted, and although it is nonsense, even moved by the end.  Great stuff!"

","The Game is an excellent piece of film on many levels, not least of which is the strong philosophical perspective I believe it supports.

Conrad's gift to Nicholas is not just some life-enriching experience; he is giving Nicholas back his soul. There are many other excellent aspects of this film as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography alone is worth a second viewing, especially the grainy Super-8 style bits at the beginning set against the silent backdrop of those giant trees on Nicholas Van Orten's elegant estate, and the action scenes are crisp.<br/><br/>I used to dislike the way Michael Douglas was always playing this type of character, but I truly believe he was born to play this part.  This movie, along with A Perfect Murder, has renewed my appreciation of him as an actor.<br/><br/>The editing and storyline were very tight, with a good pace and rich detail that constantly keep the viewer alert for fear of missing a crucial clue to what is going on.

","**SEMI-SPOILER**<br/><br/>The Game is a wonderful film.  I could stick with saying just that, but this film is getting highly criticized for it's tendency to be ""unrealistic"" or too ""out-there"".  But David Fincher has this movie more in his control than we think.  I hear a lot of ""Well, how did they know he would do exactly this"" or ""There's no way to tell he would've gone here or here"".  But what we are supposed to understand is that the ""Company"" has got this totally organized.  They are very thorough with their attention to detail, and we can see this in the scenes where Nicholas is getting examined, tested, or whatever you want to call it by the ""Company"".  It is evident that lots of hard work and time were put into this one small factor of the plot.  I mean, tests are created, workers are hired, an entire office building floor is setup.  You think that with how hard the ""Company"" worked on that one thing, that they would mess up on something so small as getting Nicholas to go one way or the other?  This was obviously a professional team of workers, if he didn't go where they wanted him to, they would've MADE him go there.  If he didn't escape or didn't take the right key or use the right words or fall into the right situation, they would have had to make it happen.  This is evident if you watch the film close enough.  And one might say that the idea of this kind of controlled living would be impossible.  Well then why was it so easy to believe in say, the Truman Show?  But enough of that, onto the film itself.  David Fincher did a wonderful job of drowning us into this dark world along with the character of Nicholas Van Orton.  The settings were perfect and eerily dark, it had an gritty urban feel to it the whole way through.  Nicholas Van Orton is played wonderfully by Michael Douglas, as we remain just as confused as him throughout the film.  It's very interesting to see how this methodical, serious-as-a-heart-attack millionaire starts to lose his mind, and how he goes back to the basic human instincts that anyone would use to get to the bottom of this situation. Fincher did a good job of helping us connect with his character throughout the stages of the film.  The best part about this movie is that you HAVE to watch the whole thing.  The first part gets you captivated, the second part gets you confused and curious along with Nicholas, the third part gets you very much so involved, and then BANG, the ending comes and you are blown away.  And anyone who says they could've predicted it is lying.  This film had not one but TWO shock endings, and they are both done perfectly.  This film was the first I had seen from David Fincher, and he had quickly became one of my favorite directors shortly after.

","********SPOILERS********* SPOILERS**********<br/><br/>The movie begins by showing Nicholas Van Orten living a constricted, joyless, emotionally dead and isolated but very affluent life in the days before his impending 48th birthday -- the same on which his father killed himself. He's given a present from his brother, who's also been obviously scarred by the aftermath of their father's suicide as evidenced by the chaotic life he's led. The present is The Game. From the moment Nicolas is clued into the leaking CRS pen in his shirt pocket by a man in the airport, his life begins to unravel. (This is the same man who, at the movie's end at the bar at the banquet, holds the contract for the game that's just been played. From folklore we know of the identity of the Adversary who wants a signature on some sort of contract, don't we?)<br/><br/>As quoted in the movie by one of two men Nicholas Van Orten meets in his club lounge: John 9:25  ""Whereas once I was blind, now I can see"".<br/><br/>
But how about Matthew 16:26 ""What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?""<br/><br/>Or even Jeremiah 31:29  ""In those days people will no longer say, `The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'""<br/><br/>
For those who have had traumatic, catastrophic events in their pasts such as the suicide of a close relative or parent, the question of how much they are like them is a real one. (Van Orten even asks his housekeeper, Ilsa -- the still-lovely Carroll Baker, where ya been??! -- ""How much like my father am I?"") It's also common knowledge that suicide seems to ""run"" in families as shown, unfortunately, in the Hemmingway clan. What gripped me about this movie was the director and writers' intent of addressing very tricky, subtle questions of personal identity, predestination and the volatile effects of that mixture of nature versus nurture on the human psyche.<br/><br/>
The Game flies furiously through that realm between madness and spiritual rebirth a few of us have been lucky/unlucky enough to be forced to play in. The endless and exhaustive psychological evaluation Van Orten is forced to undergo before beginning the game is a tip-off to the depth of knowledge of his character that only an omniscient entity could have of a human soul. CRS is a stand-in for God. Nothing less could account for CRS' fantastic foreknowledge of  Van Orten's reactions to each new twist.<br/><br/>Of course this movie is unbelievable in a literal sense, but that's obviously not exclusively or primarily how the director intended it to be viewed although there is a powerful attempt to make it work on that level, as well. But how about a parable? Until I popped ""The Game"" into IMDB's search engine I didn't know the director, David Fincher, had also directed Fight Club and Seven, the latter being another movie with biblical overtones while the former also deals with psychosis/Multiple Personality Disorder as well as any movie ever could . . . in a wild, over-the-top and hilarious way, that is. The Game, like Fight Club, is another movie by director David Fincher that addresses real questions of the human condition using elements from the action/suspense genre. Exploring themes of personal identity and spiritual awakenings in such a subversive way can have its payoffs, but can also alienate many viewers whose struggle with their suspension of disbelief overwhelms those deeper themes.<br/><br/>What happens during the course of the film is the stripping of Van Orten's wealth and dignity and the shredding of his sanity. All the external trappings of his life are systematically tested to the breaking point as he's humiliated and eventually humbled by circumstances always beyond his ability to predict, control or overcome. Truly a fall from a great height. In a penultimate twist he's drugged and buried in an old cemetery in Mexico -- a beautifully shot scene among many -- forced to sell his father's heirloom watch to get back across the border and reduced to a bedraggled, beaten pilgrim on a crowded bus heading northward; not much separating him from everyone else around him. A woman rests her head on his shoulder, sleeping. Not something we'd expect from this formerly rich financier. He has to beg for a ride to San Francisco in a roadside diner. When he gets there he admits his faults to his former wife who still obviously loves and forgives him although she's remarried. Some subtle and not so subtle signs of death and rebirth for the character.<br/><br/>But he's still enmeshed in the game, even though he thinks he's got the upper hand and a loaded gun in it and is about to pull back the curtain to ""see the wizard"" at CRS.<br/><br/>So, on the rooftop when, in his panicked paranoia he shoots his brother Conrad, he reacts in the only way he can. The question of nature/nurture, the theme woven into this movie from the opening credits -- is it genetic or incredibly seductive and powerfully strong patterned behaviour? -- comes to the surface for Nicholas Van Orten. The point of the game was to break him after all, wasn't it? To force him to this moment. It's what Life often does to us, finds those deep fault lines and drives in a wedge with relentless blows like CRS had done. Sometimes you have to live through your worst nightmare, to submit to or be dragged through your deepest fear in order to transcend it. But does he live? Shattered to the core he steps up onto the ledge and falls . . . . . .and lands on a huge air mattress in the midst of some Great Banquet: another Christian image. (Did anyone else notice that Conrad had an exit wound in his back from the gunshot when he hugged his broken and stunned brother?) So what's ""real"" or intended here? There's the dark guy with the beard from the airport who has the contract and awaits their signatures: the dark Trickster, that instrumental angel.<br/><br/>The Game is stunningly realized from the superb acting of the entire cast and the deliberate and sure directing of David Fincher to the haunting score, dark, beautifully foreboding cinematography, the shifting levels of chicanery and the bits of sardonic humor: the CRS psych interrogator holding up the cartoon picture of a car sailing off a cliff and Van Orten saying in annoyed deadpan ""Oops."" Van Orten, in silhouette, silently thrashing the briefcase he couldn't open!<br/><br/>""Off to shear some more sheep!"""

To think about the reality from another point of view.  The reality is indeed like a game, only in real life, the games don't run this way, maybe not this fierce.

","First of all, I think we can all agree that something like this could never happen in real life.  Reviewers who pick apart the various plot points are taking this film way too seriously........For me, it satisfied all my basic requirements........it was unlike anything I had ever seen before, (so it gets several points for originality alone), it held my interest for the entire movie and I thought the actors all did a great job.  I was especially impressed with Michael Douglas.  I haven't seen him in a while and I had forgotten what a good actor he can be.<br/><br/>Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the movie wasn't as ""creepy"" as I thought it was going to be.  The ending was not a big surprise to me (probably the weakest part of the movie), but many of the twists and turns were, so overall I thought it was pretty gripping.  I gave it 8/10."
"Andy C-2","9","1","2","14 April 2001"," Entertaining and clever
","Before I watched this film, I heard some people compare it to the Truman show. First of all the Truman Show has Jim Carrey (a clown 'actor' - his 'acting' abilities are badly shown up here), this has Micheal Douglas, the Truman show is totally boring and unintelligent, this is entertaining and intelligent. In summary the Truman show is rubbish this is again quite the opposite.<br/><br/>I think this film is entertaining from start to finish as an action/thriller intends to be, but avoids all the common action cliches involved of tacky one-liners when something blows up. It also has clever twisting plot, in that it constantly leaves the view wondering whether he's been conned out of all his money and his life, or whether it is 'just a game'. The same applies to the characters involved, you never really sure who's real and who's not. You can also see the point of the game in trying to add excitement to his mundane and seemingly unhappy life, the old chestnut of being rich, but so what? its only money - is clearly present. The direction, acting, set design, stunts etc are all very impressive as well, and most of all the attention to detail.<br/><br/>With all these elements put together I think this is a very good film, one of the best films I've seen made in the late 1990's. (Along with Lock Stock, Snatch, Smoke (1995), and American Beauty). Also note: Traffic is superb, watch it (video/DVD in America, cinema in UK), if you haven't already.<br/><br/>Admitably this film has many 'flaws' plot wise, in that obviously CMS couldn't practically do all the things they did, with the precision they did. But this doesn't necessary mean that the film isn't good nevertheless, we don't know if this is set futuristically - where some of things could be possible, due to technology currently unimagineable. And theres no reason that he wouldn't react the way he did right at the very end, everyone is different - its naive to think he would be angry necessarily rather than relieved.<br/><br/>Although I can see how this film isn't for all tastes, as a sense of realism is essential to some people - maybe the less open-minded and unadventurous audience, who knows? I gave this film 9/10."
"byrne_c","Null","1","2","26 March 2001"," Mind-blowing
","This is such a great movie, it keeps you guessing to the end. All of these people raving about the twists in movies like 'The Sixth Sense' need to have a reality check and hire out this classic. The formula seems simple enough, take a middle aged business man with too much money and not enough time, make him part of a game that seems to be innocent enough but quickly becomes out of control, plunging his life into a nightmare of events that he can't escape, or can he??? Not so simple, anymore. Just when he thinks he's on top, the rules of the game change, leaving him wondering just who is one step ahead of who??? In the end, it is the audience who is left reeling. A must see for those of you with a taste for your more intelligent movies. Plus, Michael Douglas is in it, and that usually says a lot about the quality of the film."
"danbo-6","Null","1","2","5 March 2001"," WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH!!
","I saw this film on TV the other night, and am only glad that I didn't pay to see it at the cinema. A few points worthy of note:<br/><br/><ul><li>Just 'cos a film's directed by David Fincher doesn't automatically mean it's a masterpiece. He's managed to acquire an undeserved reputation as a Hollywood ""wunderkind"", endlessly praised by 22-year-old film-school graduates (or ""readers of Empire magazine"", as they're more commonly known), who think that films shot with lousy lighting and lots of rain are just soooo original (see Fight Club, Seven, etc.).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why is the plot such a copout? The film would surely have been far more impressive if it had stuck to the abstract idea of Michael Douglas being subjected to the Game for the sheer hell of it - I know it transpires in the end that the Game was the whole point, but in the meantime it degenerates into a confused hour-long car chase.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does Michael Douglas only seem to appear in morally repugnant films? He may look good on camera, but his overall personality seems pretty objectionable.</li></ul><br/><br/>So there you go - The Game is over-rated, over-hyped, over-praised, and way over the top. Plus, while we're being all arty and filmy, the innercity scenes looked like they were heavily ripped off Martin Scorsese's under-rated 1985 film, ""After Hours"":if you haven't seen it, watch it - it knocks The Game over and TRAMPLES on it!!"

","This film is a shining example of how versatile David Fincher is, keeping in mind that this was only his third motion picture you have to be totally amazed at just how competently he handles every aspect of this film. His use of characters and actors is second to none, I would have to say this is the best performance from Michael Douglas that I have seen in the past 10 years.

"Tunica","7","1","2","19 February 2000"," Could Anyone Play it?
","Like most David Fincher movies, The Game has style and tension to spare. The problem I had with it was that it lay in the middle zone of fantasy; that is, it introduced elements of high fantasy into a low fantasy world. This odd combination prevented this viewer from achieving the needed level of suspension of disbelief. The movie starts with an excellent premise, but the storyline becomes increasingly implausible. Only a puppet could have been at all the right places at the right times, as Mike Douglas's character was. Problem is that this character has an Alpha Dog personality and could never have been manipulated in this way. Beyonf that, many elements of the game were so risky that it is unlikely the player would have lived through them.<br/><br/>Basically, what The Game plays on is the wide-spread belief and/or superstition that there is one or more highly organized group of people in this world that could take total control of your life.

"GreyHunter","6","1","3","6 December 2019"," I really want to rate this movie higher
","The acting is great -- Douglas, especially, was amazing, and the action gradually, then frantically, picked up the pace to make this a true thriller. The premise was interesting, even though you could see both major twists coming a mile away (partly a function, sadly, of knowing that few movies would have the huevos to end this movie ten minutes earlier than it did end.) It had plenty going for it except...<br/><br/>...I haven't read any other reviews here, but I suspect my criticism can be found in many of them: the movie asks too much in terms of suspension of belief. Some of the events were guided. I get that. But there were so many possible ways things could go completely wrong, and all the personality tests in the world wouldn't be able to predict how a man will react to serious danger and stress for what I can only assume was the first time in his life. The extent of control needed to pull this off would require resources and (wo)manpower and contingency planning to put a serious dent into Nicholas' own $600 million dollar fortune. They couldn't just plan for a straightforward trip and have alternate plans on paper. They would have to allocate the same amount of time, money and resources to every possible contingency because an alternate plan is just a piece of paper if you don't actually have the resources in place to execute it if it becomes necessary. And this is the generous assessment of the suspension of disbelief issue. The harsher one is that they literally couldn't possible control the chaos enough to make the game feasible, let alone safe. All it takes is Douglas deciding to run in front of a car in panic or despair, or grabbing a random knife somewhere and slitting somebody's throat or deciding to board the wrong transportation in Mexico or throwing a certain blonde of the wrong side of the roof for things to go very wrong. I just couldn't buy that any organization could have that much power and control. We can't even get the government to pull off anything perfectly (people forget, for instance, that the carefully-planned and executed killing of Osama by the U.S. government still resulted in a crashed helicopter) and the government has more resources than any novelty company.<br/><br/>A couple other issues -- the organization was still breaking laws. Doing questionable things to a guy who signed a release? Sure, fine. Impersonating a police officer, reckless driving/endangerment, intercepting electronic communications? Transporting someone illegally over national borders? Felonies, and no release in the world will change that. And, in my personal opinion, Nicholas' rapid turnaround and ability to accept everything in good humor at the end just...seemed unlikely, especially for a high-strung man like Nicholas. Eventually coming to term with it, I can buy. Just not a 15 second transformation into a jolly good fellow. It's the most supremely optimistic Hollywood idea of how a person would react to a given situation I've seen in a good long while.<br/><br/>But, yeah, it was a fun watch anyway. I just can't gloss over the suspension of disbelief issue to rate the movie higher."

","This movie was forced upon me by my step father, ""this is the kind of movie where you must pay attention 100% of the time"" excellent, my kind of movie.<br/><br/>The protagonist of this movie is a wealthy gentleman though his name escapes me, I have no idea why, I remember the names of most the characters in this movie, but his I guess just wasn't as memorable as ""Conrad"".<br/><br/>Scrooge McDuck is approached by his brother who looks like he's young enough to be his son, he hands him a card, insisting he call the number. This is the first of about a million plot conveniences that will occur in this movie. He goes to the base of operations from which this company operates from, why? Plot convenience.
He asked exactly what is it that they do? Oh, they do games, fantastic, well I'm a wealthy business man and I have no time for games, take your noodles and shove them up your- this doesn't happen. For the sake of plot convenience he stays for most the day, answering stupid questions and doing random tests.<br/><br/>I don't want to go on about the plot too much, but I will mention some moments that were especially... Plot conveniencey.<br/><br/>There's one scene that particularly stands out to me, McDuck is trapped in a taxi as it's sinking into the water, though he manages to escape using an item he had obtained earlier, fantastic, he didn't die! It's so good that in a situation where most people would panic and just try punch the window or something, he was able to think clearly and logically. And if he didn't, and he just died, oh well, guess that's that.<br/><br/>The absolute WORST scene in the entire movie:
McDuck is on a roof holding a woman hostage with a gun, she explains it was a birthday treat, he of course, after almost dying a few times, doesn't believe her, one thing leads to another and he fatally shoots his brother through a champagne bottle, killing him in seconds. Drowning in guilt, the poor man walks to the edge of the roof, and jumps off falling to his death, dying the same say his father died... And at the same age, it was a heart wrenching moment.
He falls through the glass, lands on a super safe bouncey castle and lives to tell the tail, hahaha you idiots, he didn't kill his brother, he didn't jump to his death! It's so good that they were able to predict with 100% certainty the exact part of the ledge that he'd jump from, it's not like he could of jumped from anywhere else, its not like he could of tried to kill himself in any other way. What if instead of casually stepping off the edge to fall to his death, what if he had ran and jumped?<br/><br/>And after all that, he seems to be happy and grateful for all the dread and stress he's been through??? I'd be so angry that it'd be punching whoever was closest to me! The experience probably took 10 hears off his life. Why did anyone think it was a good idea???<br/><br/>I went into this movie, told that I had to pay attention to every detail, not to switch off for a second as every single frame was of the upmost importance. I'd say though, this is the kind of movie where you have to switch your brain off, don't analyze ANYTHING, as the holes are everywhere."

"jrarichards","9","1","3","29 July 2018"," Still an effective and enjoyable watch, with Douglas in his prime
","Today I dug out the video (not DVD) collection as a kind of challenge to myself, had my attention drawn to the 1997 movie ""The Game"" from David Fincher (who has since gone on to several other good things), and gave the cassette a whirl through the machine for only the second time in its existence.<br/><br/>Doubtless we've got used to Michael Douglas doing this kind of thing but here in ""The Game"" he is in - shall we say - his ""middle period"", and the film very largely hangs on what he can bring to it - which is plenty. His character Nicholas Van Orton goes a little past cliche, which is nice. Although he's an investment banker (which goes without saying, I guess), and although he's doubtless good at what he does, there's actually a good dose of clumsiness, fear and self-doubt - even self-loathing - just below the surface here, as well as plenty of loneliness right on the surface; yet when things go off the rails (as they regularly do in a Michael Douglas film) he's not THAT effective, but actually a bit of stumblebum.<br/><br/>This does much to endear him to us.<br/><br/>The plot is well into the realms of fantasy - and you'd do VERY well to ignore the more-thoughtful morality side - but somehow it's darned good - even 21 years down the line. Carried out with conviction and seeking out what are (apparently) a host of great San Francisco locations most (though crucially not all) of which are definitely on the wrong side of the tracks; it proves great fun (especially as we in the audience get all the benefits of what happens here without having to take on ANY of the risks). In that way it gets to be quite a rollercoaster ride, with moments of comedy and thrills and spills all thrown in).<br/><br/>Interesting how times change - in a more recent film we would surely have expected more from ""Christine"" (a fascinating enough character played here by Deborah Kara Unger) - in this respect some of our wishes go rather unfulfilled! Even Sean Penn doesn't do that much, though he's OK when on-screen. Personally, I've always had a soft spot for ""the"" character that James Rebhorn plays, so that's a reward for me at least, as he gets quite a bit of screentime.<br/><br/>But in the end it's mainly down to Douglas as Van Orton, and this is not entirely by chance given the nature of the film, which can be watched and enjoyed with no problem whatever in 2018."

"colinscouser-05442","8","1","3","31 December 2017"," With respect to Remington Steele
","Michael Douglas' performance superbly holds this film together. Now matter how ludicrous the plot becomes - and it does become ludicrous - Douglas plays it so that he and the audience together are none the wiser and piece it together at the same speed. <br/><br/>Although it seemed highly original to me at first, in fact its plot owes a lot to the 1984 Remington Steele episode 'Elementary Steele'. The fact that punters have paid £500 to a business so as to take part in 'The Game' where a mystery is laid out for them around the city to solve; the fact that it starts to look like a scam; that the punters (playing Holmes and Watson) chase someone who they think is part of The Game but she protests she is not, and says she is just an actress, when she clearly knows more than she is letting on; plus. gunshots fired (at Remington Steele) in the street turn out to be blanks because the gun is part of the Game; plus, when Remington Steele visits the business's offices (doing his detective there), he finds almost no-one and nothing in the room (basic office furniture); etc, etc. All these things are developed in the Michael Douglas film, turning a light romp into a dark thriller that keeps you guessing. Highly entertaining and tense. It's increasingly less and less plausible but Douglas keeps you believing, just."
"SnoopyStyle","5","1","3","26 September 2014"," Functional gimmick expertly executed
","Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a lonely divorcée and extremely wealthy San Francisco investment banker. It's his 48th birthday which is the age of his father when he committed suicide in front of him. His absentee black sheep brother Conrad (Sean Penn) returns and gives him a card. What do you get for somebody who has everything? Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) which Conrad claims to be the best thing that ever happened to him. It's an unique game different for everybody. Jim Feingold (James Rebhorn) does the examination for CRS but Nicholas is rejected. Then he finds a dummy sprawled on his driveway with a CRS key and the game begins. Strange things start to happen. Waitress Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) spills on him and gets fired. They both get sucked into the CRS game.<br/><br/>This starts too slowly. There is a general lack of energy. The first 30 minutes almost lost me waiting for things to happen. It wants to be atmospheric. David Fincher is certainly good enough but I find myself not caring about Nicholas. He's a rich annoying douche with very little to like about him. It's an interesting if somewhat unoriginal gimmick. It would probably be better as a horror. I guess it would be helpful if I am naive enough to buy into the game. It would also be helpful to have a younger, sweeter, and more innocent actress to play Christine. The movie never escapes its manufactured sensibility. The point of most of this genre is to have Nicholas act paranoid and for the audience to question his sanity. His sanity is never in doubt in the mind of the audience. It's just one insane thing happening to him after another. And the cops would never say it's OK to murder him as long as Nicholas signed the contract. It's kinda stupid but the movie asks the audience to buy into it. It's so well made that I'm fine with how crazy this game gets. However it does go one too many turn. It would have been much better to leave with a sad ending."
"vincenttiggelman","5","1","3","14 September 2014"," Like a Ferrari without the engine.
","Let me start by saying the film has good atmosphere. The usual murky dark-brown tones that David Fincher is so good at. And Michael Douglas plays well, although the part is so familiar to him it's a bit like Bambi playing Bambi. Still, he pulls it off. <br/><br/>But then there is the story itself. So it's a game. Or is it? Or isn't it? Or is it? Or...oh well, you get the picture. The film starts off quite promising with millionaire banker Nicolas van Outen slowly being sucked into strange and gradually more and more dangerous situations. He is not sure who he can trust and whether the game is either real or if he's being screwed by some criminal organization. He gets more and more paranoid as he discovers that people he thought he could trust turn out to be in on it as well. All this is quite interesting when the viewer also believes that the game is not really a game but some kind of a con.<br/><br/>But the ending is such a disappointment that i find it hard to believe anything that happened in the 2 hours leading up to the plot twist, that really isn't a plot twist at all. The game turns out not to be a game at all until we find out that it was just a game after all. When we find this out, everything we have seen turns out to be as unbelievable as a fairy tale. And i guess that is what this movie is: a fairy tale. Filled with incredible plot holes and far-fetched situations that could have gone wrong at any given time. Nicolas could have died in the taxi, killed himself making that ridiculous jump in the end (what if he chose to jump off the other side or cut his neck open on the glass in those 2 ceilings?) or if he decided to buy a real gun because the creeping paranoia blurring his rational thinking? It's simply too nonsensical.<br/><br/>So in the end the film looks good, sounds good and is well played but far too unbelievable to leave me satisfied."

","I have to feel very strongly about a movie before I would want to spend precious time writing about it.

It just keeps piling up more and more ridiculous scenes one after another. At the end of it, I truly felt I wasted 2 hours of my time and my money. <br/><br/>In fact, I was about to hail the movie when it was turning out that the game was a big scam job. It should have been that way and would have been totally credulous. Then came that grand silly ridiculous ending. <br/><br/>In fact, when I watched David Fincher's other movie, Seven, I really couldn't buy into it as I found the ways the murders were carried out highly unbelievable. But it was a very well-made movie so I could forgive the incredulous elements there. Little did I realize the much higher bounds of Mr Fincher's penchant for and capability in concocting incredulity until The Game.<br/><br/>Even the dumbest action movie has more credulity than this. If not for the good video quality, I would have given a 1 or 2 rating, because I do still feel very pi**ed with it."

That being said, when he does occasionally get excited about something it's for a good reason, and I've never known him to be wrong.<br/><br/>One quiet evening back in 1997 I received an email from him that said, ""Sell all you have run and see The Game.""

I was bewildered, shocked, happy, and totally satiated by the single best cinematic ride I had ever been on. <br/><br/>Hollywood labels movies by genre, so you will find The Game listed under drama, mystery, thriller. Today, sixteen years later, we would probably say psychological-thriller, but combine all of these genres, and you still haven't rightly labeled this movie.

","I suppose ""The Game"" was the first film I ever saw that had a twist ending that was actually twisted. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a great movie, sure, but the ending wasn't twisted. A shocker, yes, but not twisted. Even the killer from ""Se7en"", Fincher's masterpiece, wasn't a twist ending. A twist, yes, a surprise, hell yes, but a twist ending? No.<br/><br/>With Michael Douglas and Sean Penn headlining a cast that also includes James Rebhorn and Armin Muehler Stahl, you wouldn't expect a twist at all. No, with these actors you'd probably expect maybe a nice little thriller or maybe even a comedy of sorts, and that's why ""The Game"" is such a masterful film. These actors are so completely taken out of their element it's scary.<br/><br/>Douglas is Nicolas Van Orton, a rich man who's unhappiness in life has been noticed by his brother, the care-free, James Dean-ish Conrad Van Orton. Conrad gives an unthanking Nicolas a card for CRS, a company that will make Nicolas' life better. And so begins a long, perilous, and unimaginably entertaining psycholgical mind game where Nicolas' life doesn't just turn upside down, it turns inside out.<br/><br/>I loved ""Se7en"", so I had high hopes for ""The Game"" and this film didn't at all disappoint. In fact it raised the bar so much that I've made a point to see every Fincher film since. (Fight Club and Zodiac are also fantastic films) The camera-work is awesome, with each scene having and holding a growing sense of claustrophobia.<br/><br/>The acting is just superb. I don't think Michael Douglas is able to turn in a bad role. He's just as good in this as he was in ""Wall Street"", and will be when ""Wall Street 2"" comes out this month. Penn is also very good, showing his stripes as the free-wheeling brother. Deborah Unger is beautiful and underrated as an actress, I wish she'd be in more movies like this. Stahl and Rebhorn show why they are also some of Hollywood's most underrated blood.<br/><br/>To sum it up, ""FANTASTIC MOVIE."" The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the film as a whole, awesome. The ending absolutely blew me away. Don't just rent this one, buy it, because you'll want to watch it again and again."

","The Game is a non-stop homage to Hitchcock, from the never-quite-modern San Francisco milieu to the symbolic doors, windows, mirrors, stairs, glass shards, blood, to the clueless man on the run from inexplicable evil, to fake falls off very high places to lifeless mannequins propped up in chairs.<br/><br/>Check the suggestive sign that lights up behind Michael Douglas as he moves to look down a subway staircase (which is really stairs from a bridge to the street) with a phone (and weird derelict) at the bottom; then a split edit with phone ring audio leading that cuts to Douglas answering a quite different phone. Consider the lyrics of the Jefferson Airplane/Grace Slick ""White Rabbit,"" which appears in the film and is reprised in its entirety over the end credits.<br/><br/>Like every Hitchcock movie, The Game is, itself, a game: thoroughly engrossing when you're playing it, but obviously preposterous when you think about it five minutes later. If playing the game of The Game(and spotting all the Hitchcock tropes) is for you, you'll have a blast. If you're irritated by the wildly implausible (and even downright impossible), go watch a documentary.<br/><br/>If you fall in between, as I did, give in to the chase (BTW, the R rating must be solely for some F-- words: there's no explicit sex or violence) and enjoy the show. A great film it ain't; but for high class Hollywood production, it wins in every category."

"billreynolds","10","1","3","16 May 2005"," John, chapter nine, verse twenty-five
","""The Game,"" much like ""Se7en,"" ""Fight Club,"" and ""Panic Room,"" is both an extraordinarily well-crafted and extremely thought-provoking movie. Like ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club,"" ""The Game"" contains a shocking twist near the end that forces you to reevaluate the entire movie. Many viewers don't like the twist (as can be seen from some of the comments here), contending that it makes the whole film a waste of time. They may have a point, but I can't say I agree with them. In a way, ""The Game"" is a descendant of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" in that what happens is essentially a dream that is still important though none of it really ""happened,"" because of how the dream affects the main character.<br/><br/>""The Game"" began life as a spec script that reputedly floated around Hollywood for years, well-respected as a piece of work but considered unfilmable. Enter David Fincher, who has made a career of filming the difficult, the outrageous, and the provocative.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas gives a brilliant performance as Nicholas Van Orton. In a way, this seems to be the role he was born to play. Only Gordon Gekko rivals this character in Douglas's career. Part of the problem with Douglas is that you tend to get the same performance, the same persona every time out, and Nicholas is almost type-casting. But this movie asks Douglas to go a little farther than I've ever seen him go. He finds real levels of panic and desperation in his performance here that are fascinating coming from such a normally controlled actor.<br/><br/>This movie is basically about the humiliation and degradation of Nicholas Van Orton, breaking him down and stripping him to nothing in order that he can build again from a solid foundation. As a result, although the movie for the most part plays very seriously as a tense thriller, on repeat viewings one can perceive a wicked streak of black humor running through almost every scene. Many of Douglas's moments in the film are extremely, though subtly, humorous -- such as when he's talking to the two ""new members"" at his club about the game; he perfectly conveys both the fear of embarrassment and secret interest that Nicholas is feeling. Or the look on his face as the runaway taxi is about to crash into the bay (with him in it), or when machine gun fire suddenly rakes the window behind him at ""Christine's"" apartment.<br/><br/>The things CRS does to Nicholas are both hilarious and disturbing. He is very much a Scrooge character at the beginning of the movie -- cold and isolated, mean and unhappy. One set piece after another humiliates, unnerves, and ultimately terrifies him, until he has no control left over what used to be his life, and finally he can take action with no thought for consequences.<br/><br/>Perhaps what is most disappointing about the ending for many viewers is that Nicholas ultimately ""loses"" the game -- CRS drives him to commit suicide (or so he believes), and he only survives because they have arranged for him to survive. In a strong parallel to ""Se7en,"" the protagonists in both movies remain at the mercy of their antagonists (John Doe and CRS) until the bitter end, after the point at which, in an ordinary Hollywood movie, they would have successfully fought back and regained control. Ultimately, what CRS does to Nicholas is destroy his life, take everything from him, make him think he killed his own brother, and then -- give it all back to him. In the process, he does learn to be more engaged, learns that money is not what really matters in life.<br/><br/>It's a hard movie to get a handle on, and that's what I love about it. One aspect I'm not crazy about is that only a very rich person could afford the ""benefits"" of the game. But maybe a less expensive ""game"" could be tailored for a less wealthy person. And besides, part of the point seems to be that Nicholas was such a jerk at the beginning, he deserved to be treated this way. And maybe all wealthy corporate titans like Nicholas deserve to find out what it's like to lose everything.<br/><br/>As usual, in this movie Fincher moves the camera (and the objects and people being filmed) with the grace and kinetic energy of the young Spielberg, composes the frame with the beauty and attention to detail of Kubrick, and stages action and generates gut-wrenching suspense like Jimmy Cameron. Fincher's movies are always pervaded with a deep, penetrating intelligence. Everything here is thought out to the finest detail, and all aspects of the production, from sets to costumes to music to (of course) cinematography and editing are flawless. The supporting performances (and everyone here other than Douglas is really in a supporting role) are all outstanding."

","Or you can read on and let me give away the movie's secrets.  I don't really advise this.  I suspect you can't watch ""The Game"" as if for the second time unless you really are watching it for the second time; reading about it in advance probably isn't good enough.  Anyway, in some sense or other, there are serious spoilers ahead.  You have been warned.<br/><br/>The real secret, saved for the very end, is this: it really IS all a game, every minute of it.  CRS is exactly what it presents itself as being at the start.  Corollary: Nicholas is never more deeply deceived than when he thinks he's penetrated the illusion and discovered the true purpose behind the game.  The secret behind the game is that there is no secret behind the game.  It's all just a game.<br/><br/>All very clever, but it makes for a deeply unsatisfying set of ""twists"". The real twist is that there ARE no real twists - and deep down, we sense as much.  There are only ever two possibilities before us: that things are as they appear to be to Nicholas at that time, or that it's all just a game; and since we're introduced to the possibility that it's all just a game right at the start, we can never really let go of that possibility, and consequently we can never feel particularly surprised at any particular revelation or supposed revelation - least of all the revelation that it's all just a game.  If we'd been given access to information Nicholas HADN'T been given access to, information which let us KNOW that it was all a game, the cleverness of the deceit would have been far more enjoyable.  And the movie's key moment would have come across far stronger.  If we'd been half-identifying with the illusionists at CRS all along, then when Claire (if that's her real name) stared in alarm at Nick's pistol, and says, ""You're not meant to have a real gun"", this would alarm us deeply.  The moment would feel more like the climax it's meant to be rather than hurried exposition.  And - for just a moment - Fincher would have completely fooled us.  COMPLETELY fooled us.<br/><br/>This doesn't happen, but as for the rest of the movie, see it for the second time and it's almost identical to the masterpiece it could have been the first time.  Which means that it damned near IS a masterpiece (it's certainly, without any contest whatever, David Fincher's best film), however invisible this fact may be to first-time viewers."

But it's not just an excersise in ""trying to figure out what's happening""...it really pulls you in.  <br/><br/>""Keeps you on the edge of your seat"" is an oft-used cliche to describe thrillers, but it definitely applies here.

","One first-class thriller, ""The Game"" manages to catch you and reel you in with surprise and suspense. POSSIBLE SPOILERS: A creative and suspenseful story and script centers around Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a millionaire/investment banker living it up in San Francisco. He's a jerk. Plain and simple. Really mean. He's had an unhappy child hood (he saw his father kill himself) and is basically falling apart and losing focus. Mr. Douglas pulls this part off gloriously, by the way. Sean Penn is his ""interesting"" brother who gives him a birthday present that sends Douglas into a spiral of madness.<br/><br/>A ""Game"" from a company called Consumer Recreation Services. What it does is makes a person's life more interesting by pulling off complicated tricks and pranks on its clients. After many crazy situations and embarrassments, Van Orton becomes a better person. And as it turns out, that's what ""The Game"" is there for. What is interesting about Fincher's film, more than its ingenius story, is its style and feel. It is hard to grasp how amazingly everything boils down. The music consists of a high-pitched piano playing repetitious tunes which is just what Douglas is going through. Ficher's trademark colorizations are apparent throughout, mesmerizing characters and developments are there, too. The acting is great, full of hellacious outbursts and uncontrollable action. The movie pulls also enough dramatic punch for almost 5 average dramas, and the payoff is brilliant. This was easily up there with ""L.A Confidential"" and ""Titanic"" as one of 1997's best. Much better than ""Fight Club"", this is the pinnacle of David Fincher's career with the amazing ""Alien3"" and the profound ""Se7en"". What a ride! What a film! What a masterpiece!<br/><br/>10/10"

"tmensamaster-2","10","1","3","15 October 2002"," One of my 'top ten' favorites: Fincher's best film
","David Fincher's 'The Game' is a surprisingly human thriller. Instead of the 'big thrills' with no thought or care for the characters, Fincher delivers to us a film that has some surprisingly poignant moments, mixed with some real smart 'big thrills'. The film's opening sequence, set to a quiet, somber piano piece sets the tone to a thriller that will impact us emotionally, as well as jerk our adrenaline.<br/><br/>Nicholas Van Orton[Michael Douglas] is bored. He makes sarcastic, biting remarks about his life while at the same time preparing for his 48th birthday, the same age at which his father killed himself. His brother Conrad[Sean Penn] surprises him with a birthday gift, a free membership to a company that, as Conrad says, ''will make your life fun.'' Since he really doesn't have very many other leisure activities and the memories of his father are bothering him, he decides to sign up. What he doesn't know is that 'The Game' may be too 'fun' for him.<br/><br/>The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since 'Wall Street'. Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitressis she a waitress?]. Sean Penn is quite good[in a role meant for Jodie Foster of all people] at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy 'little brother'. The script  has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight 'black comedy' feel. As usual in a Fincher film, the cinematography is dark and forebodding and creates a 'noir' atmosphere of sorts. Howard Shore's music is excellent: Instead of attacking us with bombastic chords, a sound as simple as a piano tinkling is used to make our hearts race. The plotting is ingenious and one plot twist after another is instigated until the film creates a spider-web of fear and paranoia that has us mind-boggled. The films themes[of redemption and paranoia] are followed through right to the end in an ending that some think is supremely contrived.<br/><br/>Why? The film has followed its logical course to this destination and fulfills its themes. I personally LOVE this ending and think it is one of the most surprising ones I've seen in recent movies. It twists us around one-hundred and eighty degrees, flips us upside down and leaves our mouths agape in a 'WOW' shape. I ask, 'Is there a better way to end a movie than that?'<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film: it is an astounding. arresting and emotionally exhausting thrill-ride that deserves multiple viewings to fully appreciate...........A true classic..... 10/10"
"JessicaLouise","10","1","3","25 May 2001"," Amazing
","After I watched Fight Club, I never thought I would ever see another movie of comparable quality.  The Game is of comparable quality.  I guess that David Fincher has a knack for choosing excellent projects to direct.  I am still in a state of shock over how wonderful this movie is.  Usually, I am able to figure out movies well before the ending is revealed, but I was completely engaged for the duration - trying to figure out this one.  If you have not yet seen this film, you had better."

","Wow.<br/><br/>Divid Fincher delivers, yet again. Those of you familiar to his work,(ex. SE7EN, Fight Club) will undeniably love this crazy piece of celluliod. Fincher's ""in your face"" guerilla style of filmmaking leaps out at you, grabs you by the cajones, and shoves a big gun in your face. What I'm trying to say, is that, this is the kind of film that takes you for a very dangerous ride right up until the end. It has various twists and turns and it keep you thinking. No rest. I'm not gonna give you a synopsis. I'd just be regurgitating something that's been explained over and over again. What I mean by, ""this movie keeps you thinking"", is that you can't ever be sure if the guy is still involved in the game or not. Is all this real or is it just part of a major conspiracy focused solely on YOU. Is all this part of the biggest mind-f*** ever carried out? You have to watch this movie to the very end.

The adventure Michael Douglas gets involved in is truly worthwhile to watch, a ""rollercoaster ride"", so to speak. When it's all over you're left with lots of questions but it's<br/><br/>a disgrace that some of the viewers have ""answered"" them all with their comments. The end may be a strange one but that's why such movies are being made.Life is already predictable enough. The fun part of this movie is that you're left to find yourself the answers to the questions it raises. How wonderful that there ARE movies like this one, a thriller like none ever made before.

It's a vehicle alright...It'll drive ya right up a wall."
"bababear","Null","1","3","30 August 1998"," Good beginning and ending, too long a middle
","THE GAME starts out so well that it's a shame it bogs down in the middle.  But the ending more than makes up for it. At two hours and eight minutes it runs way, way too long. It needs at least half an hour cut out of it.  If fact, more than an hour and a half could be cut and it could be run as the most expensive episode ever of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.<br/><br/>But, as I said, it starts well.  Nicholas is an investment banker, played by Michael Douglas with his WALL STREET characterization and wardrobe intact.  Nicholas makes money.  Nicholas has money.  Nicholas wants more money. He lives alone in a huge house in San Francisco, presumably spending his evenings alone counting his money.<br/><br/>Of course, his life is going to change.  That's the film's whole thesis.  Instead of changing in an unusual way, though, what happens blends elements of SECRET CINEMA (and this year's THE TRUMAN SHOW), THE WIZARD OF OZ, and A CHRISTMAS CAROL into a meatloaf of a movie made with leftover ingredients.<br/><br/>Nicholas's birthday comes along, and he gets together for dinner with his brother Conrad (Sean Penn).  Conrad is the loose cannon of the family.  In and out of trouble, in and out of rehab.  He and Nicholas were both traumatized by their father's suicide many years ago, an event which will be strangely echoed in elements of THE GAME's most excellent climax.<br/><br/>Conrad has a gift for Nicholas: a gift certificate for a once in a lifetime experience.  Nicholas submits to a battery of psychological and physical tests, and soon the game begins in earnest.<br/><br/>Driving home one night, Nicholas finds a wooden clown in the driveway.  He carries the clown into the house, and later finds an important key in the clown's mouth.  While Nicholas watches the news on tv, reporter Daniel Schorr talks to Nicholas, calling him by name and alerting him to at least one hidden tv camera and microphone in the room. Before long paranoia is building in Nicholas's mind as the events become more and more bizarre; there are signifigant questions about what is real and what is paranoid fantasy. And there's a beautiful woman named Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) who changes from ally to enemy as many times as Eva Marie Saint did in NORTH BY NORTHWEST.<br/><br/>From here on the movie is a series of Chinese boxes, with plot revelations coming at ten minute intervals just like subway trains- and with the same predictability.  A big theme of the story is that the bad guys have figured Nicholas's mind out so well that they can predict his every move, and his every move gets him trapped deeper and deeper.  That same element of predictability adversely impacts the movies seemingly endless second act.<br/><br/>Nicholas is told that the game can be stopped at any time he wants, but Conrad confirms that it can't.  There's a strange conversation with Conrad in which I'd swear that about ten seconds of dialog is played twice, which gives the scene the feel of a dream, but it isn't.<br/><br/>Nicholas starts out with a life of luxury and comfort; the opening scene of the third act finds him having to hitch-hike from Mexico to San Francisco, and plead with patrons in a roadside diner to give him a ride.<br/><br/>After making a false start with the third film in the ALIEN series, director David Fincher came back like a champ with SE7EN, which I felt was by far the best film to come out that year.  THE GAME is a small step back for him, one from which he'll probably recover; if SE7EN hadn't blown me away so completely, I might be more forgiving of THE GAME.  Counting uncredited ones, a total of at least four writers worked on this film.  It shows.<br/><br/>Lord know he has a great cast to work with here.  Sure, Michael Douglas's character is familiar to us in the first act as he plays the ruthless captain of industry, but as the story progresses we see a more human side of Nicholas. Sean Penn is always a welcome sight, even if he does have a rather small part here.  And Deborah Kara Unger is a good actress who may well have great things ahead of her.<br/><br/>And that ending.  Wow, that ending.  It's not often that I'm shouting advice to onscreen characters when I watch a film on cable, but this time I was yelling ""Look out!"" and ""No!  No!  NO!!!"" loud enough that even though Michael Douglas couldn't hear me, people driving by our house probably did; hey, my family already thinks I'm strange, what the heck.<br/><br/>And a very important thing that I can assure readers of without spoiling anything: the story is NOT a dream nor is it a halucination brought on by any drug.  I was braced for it to end with Nicholas sitting bolt upright in bed drenched with sweat mumbling about what a weird dream he'd had; I didn't like that plot device in INVADERS FROM MARS or any other movie except THE WIZARD OF OZ.<br/><br/>Parents' note: THE GAME's R rating is almost entirely for language.  There's very little violence and no nudity or sex.  The R rating is to trick teenagers into thinking they'll see more than they are going to.  A skilled editor could (and should) have cut it to a PG in an afternoon.<br/><br/>On a scale of five, Pops gives THE GAME four birthday cakes."

","Somehow I missed this years ago and it popped up on Netflix and like most other NF movies I tend to check IMDB reviews as a lot are duds, however this moving getting such a high review rating I had to check it out. It starts off great and has a good suspenseful feel. Sadly though around the midpoint it just gets way to unbelievable. I get that the writers / director wants to keep you guessing if this is just a game, if it's real, who's in on it, etc... and that does keep it exciting and as far as entertainment the movie does deliver, but being so unbelievable it more or less bounced me out of the movie. Plus I thought the end was cheap and way to full of holes<br/><br/>** Spoilers ahead ** As mentioned before, I liked how it started out, was intriguing, you definitely get the feel that the lengthy interview process and all the details within would be used against him later on, and they certainly are. It was enjoyable as he started to become paranoid about who was in on it, what was going on, etc... But then right about the point where his house is completely trashed I told myself, either it's for real and he's being discredited and on the chopping block, but that didn't add up. Or it was just a game, but that was just unbelievable, either way I was bounced out of the movie.<br/><br/>From there things just get more and more ridiculous and you realize the scale of which this is operating. We're talking potentially hundreds of people involved on this game / con depending on what you're believe at the time. In the end after the big reveal (or not) you start to mentally go back and think about things and realize just how ridiculous and unbelievable it all was, even for a movie. The amount of expense to even pull something like this off would have to be a few hundred thousand dollars, given materials, people, destruction, etc... And his brother sure didn't look to me like he could have covered the bill unless he had some big inheritance he was sitting on<br/><br/>I realize it's just a movie and it was entertaining but if at the end everything comes unraveled then you come away with the feeling that you were cheated, which is how I felt. Nobody has a crystal ball and can tell exactly what a person would do, regardless if you had all the upfront info they had. Nobody could do that amount of preparation either to account for what he might have done. Then there's the other aspect that nobody was seriously hurt or killed, which is very unrealistic given all that happened. The fact that he didn't get seriously hurt, or killed, or hurt or killed anyone else for that matter. And I don't buy that the phycological screening made it so they could play him like a pawn, nobody is that predictable, especially all the elements you can't control. It's in these aspects the movie unravels itself and falls apart.<br/><br/>Now what could have made this great, albeit maybe not as action packed, is if it wasn't so over the top with the near deaths, or if it wasn't so picture perfect. He knew he was being played all along regardless if it was a game or the stakes real, but if he would have outsmarted them at points, caught them off their guard, or hit dead ends it would have made for a much more realistic aspect and made it much more believable in the end. And especially the end, you can't predict where someone is going to jump off a building to their perceived death. That definitely shouldn't have played out that way. All in all a great idea and could have been pulled off much better. I really don't understand the high rating given all the holes and how unrealistic it was, but I guess you can't please everyone..."
"bowdallen-16-351643","5","1","4","4 June 2014"," Great idea, terrible execution.
","The Game isn't terrible, it has top notch acting from both Douglas, Penn and Unger. However there's a reason this is deserving of a 5 and not an 8 or 9.<br/><br/>I can only suspend my disbelief so far and The Game is about a mile beyond that, the original idea of a man who is bored of life's activities intrigued enough to sign up for a ""game"" without any idea what it's about. However, the execution of said idea is about as ridiculous as Stalone and De Niro making a boxing movie in 2013.<br/><br/>Okay first off, 53 year old Michael Douglas would most likely die from the stunts his character performs in the movie. The first likely death or serious injury of Douglas would have occurred in the first adventure where they have to fall what looks like 25-30 feet into metal garbage bins, better have good aim considering they looked to be about 4x5 feet. Next,the taxi bail into the body of water according to Christine they had a safety net, except how long would it take to pull out a full cab of water, most likely long enough for him to drown. I'll skip the minor possibilities and go right to the most ridiculous part, the end, so Douglas shoots his brother with what i assume is a blank because they showed his chest, after shooting his brother he jumps off the building and happens to land perfectly on the target they had set up, lucky he walked off the perfect spot of the building, also lucky he didn't have a heart attack on the way down which is common for people jumping off skyscrapers, also also lucky he landed o the target zone on his back or chest and not his neck.<br/><br/>Anyways not a terrible movie but a little bit silly for me."

","Long before Occupy Wall Street, long before the term 1% (or 99% for that matter), we get The Game. The Game is one of those movies where you are captivated by the plot and action, you get to the end, you finish, and then 10 minutes later yell out, ""That film sucked!"" Why? Because of the ending, simple as that. We are thrilled with watching Michael Douglas slowly get stripped of everything he has by unseen assailants, only to find out that he was part of a game hosted by a company who caters to giving the ueber-rich a fun time. True, the Douglas character needed to have a change. His life was all cold profits and needed heart. How much better to have had him wake up from the experience and be ""changed"" somehow. Instead, I as an audience member felt not only did he go through no real change, but that the film was saying, ""Isn't it neat the kinda services the rich can afford?"" Of course, this film was made back in the '90's, when the economy was good and we still had a middle class. To see it now, it plays like the prelude to the bad dream of the excesses the 1% who have 40% of the country's wealth. This dream is of course reality, which makes The Game somewhat prophetic."

","Essentially, The Game is an interesting and fascinating film. While it is overlong, and lacking in credibility at the end, plus it is not Fincher's best film(Se7en) it does have a lot to like about it. As is the case with David Fincher, the film is visually stunning, with intriguing shots and camera angles and bold, stylish colours. Fincher's direction is ambitious and also very good, while the film's pace is brisk, the script is well crafted and the story is a great idea and is very gripping up until the ending. The acting is very good, Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as the increasingly desperate pawn and Sean Penn is equally impressive in a role that I actually think could have been bigger. All in all, it is a very good film, yes with its foibles but it is an intriguing idea constructed in an entertaining way. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"pamsfriend","5","1","4","28 September 2006"," Where's Dickens?
","The original script for The Game was written back in 1840. Seems this guy is rich, has everything, but is cold as ice. His poor assistant lives on crumbs, and in the first scene he chases those with charity in their hearts out the door. That night he eats some spoiled gruel and has this dream that leads to his salvation.<br/><br/>This script floated about for 160 years. Several tried to make a film of it but were defeated by all the treacle it summoned up. Then Fincher came along and realized what the film needed. Take San Francisco instead of London, wet streets, dark night, threatening music and do the whole thing up again and Voila! The Game.<br/><br/>Douglas plays Douglas and is impressive doing so. Sean Penn is wasted in his part and the others go through the motions. The suspense can grab you because you are not sure if Fincher is going to have Douglas reprise the suicide of his father in the script, a plot device Fancher punched up by use of old home movies. Then you realize Fincher only kills off good looking heroes like the Bradster; he couldn't possibly do this to that A-1 pr--k Douglas, so he will grant him redemption and all will live happily ever after. Btw, the home movies were used to better effect in Michael Powell's Peeping Tom.<br/><br/>I will give Fincher credit: he started to borrow the bloody toilet scene from The Conversation but decided to let us see water. And he must have loved the demise of Malkovich's assassin from In the Line of Fire, but he permits Douglas to survive his fall. <br/><br/>So it is a fairy tale or a fable which is worth an evening's entertainment, but not much more. And seeing it again time is truly a waste of time."

","When ""The Game"" first came out in theaters, I didn't really know much about it, so when I went to see it, I was pleasantly surprised. Portraying San Francisco banker Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) getting involved in a ""game"" that invades his personal life, the movie keeps you guessing every minute. I can say with certainty that I couldn't have predicted anything that happened in the movie. And that ending was sure a shocker.<br/><br/>One thing about the movie that really struck me was Sean Penn's performance. It had just been two years since he'd affirmed his presence on the silver screen with ""Dead Man Walking"", and he was now starring in this most perplexing film (around the same time, he also starred in the equally perplexing ""U Turn""). This all showed that he would soon have a solid filmography - not to mention become one of America's primary political activists.<br/><br/>But the point is that you're sure to have a good time watching this movie. It affirms David Fincher as a great director (he was also behind ""Fight Club"" and ""Panic Room""), and makes me nostalgic for autumn, 1997, when we also had movies like ""In & Out"", ""LA Confidential"" and ""Good Will Hunting"". Very well done. Also starring Deborah Kara Unger, Armin Mueller-Stahl and James Rebhorn."

He is completely aware of what is going on, but he doesn't appreciate just how far and how dangerous it will play with him. Just like being in a nightmare that you cannot wake yourself out of.<br/><br/>But the plot become rather hackneyed come the second half, primarily because its just another cat & mouse thriller that has been done to death elsewhere. The cleverness of the first half is somewhat undone come the ""join the dots"" amateur-hour of the second.<br/><br/>And the least said about the final 10 minutes the better because that really did insult the intelligence of the average viewer with its cop-out ending.

But it was just purely coincidental that he should fall in exactly the right place to fall through the glass roof and straight onto a waiting air cushion, suffering only minor cuts. How did the people organsing The Game, know he would attempt the suicide on exactly the right spot on the roof and to fall on the exact spot on the air cushion?<br/><br/>Moreover, because it was just a game, nothing had really changed because he would soon return to normal life - rich and arrogant with perhaps a touch of much needed humility at the end of it. But in essence I really couldn't have cared less whether this guy lived or died because of who he was and how he treated people. But blame that on the script!<br/><br/>Oh, and Sean Penn is totally wasted here. He is not my favorite actor by far, but he does have considerable talent when fully utilized - but it was left wanting here.<br/><br/>And to cap it off, the soundtrack is absolutely appalling - straight out of a 1970s murder mystery TV movie, with what sounds like an incredibly bored pianist randomly pounding on the keys!<br/><br/>This Game should have been abandoned at half time!"

He is effectively broken down by CRS in order to see the, ultimately, ineffective protective false persona he's unconsciously adopted. From here he can re-build his true self and finally accept and move through the past trauma, just as his brother has. A brilliant film where the purpose isn't about the plausibility of the staged situations per se (although, all can be plausible if CRS are comprehensive and genius enough with back-up plans A-Z, which you assume they are), the purpose is achieving successful therapy for unresolved trauma hiding behind a protective false persona facade."

","The Game is a film starring Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a successful businessman who receives a gift from his brother Conrad Van Orton (Sean Penn) for his birthday. The gift was a certificate for a program, a program called 'The Game' little did Douglas know it, this Game would change his life forever. The Director David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club) did a fantastic job in this movie. The whole film was so captivating, and Douglas' performance was one of the greatest i've seen. It was such a different, and interesting concept of a film, it was definitely one that was always stay with me after seeing it. With fantastic twists and turns throughout the whole movie, and great supporting performances from Penn, The Game is a real treat! I tend to love everything that Michael Douglas is in, he hasn't done any film i've seen where he didn't give an amazing performance. One of his most memorable performance was from Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street' as Gordon Gekko. That was a brilliant performance, but in my opinion, his performance as Nicholas Van Orton stands higher up the rank. Don't miss the game! One of the most well- thought psychological thrillers of the 90s."
"sharky_55","6","0","1","1 February 2016"," The game is up.
","Much of The Game is presented as your stock standard thriller, with all the Fincher touches. Flashbacks flicker in our main character Nicholas Van Orton's mind, using old video footage to establish the tragedy that still lingers many years later. The vast, dim halls of his mansion are lonely, something that its elegance and luxury cannot hide. When he leaves the comfort of his wealth, he is bombarded with rubbish dumps and dirty back alleys, and sirens and street lights, overexposed, blast at his eyes. When he enters the hotel room that seeks to incriminate him, there is that cold blue tint, nearly as menacing as its contents, and Fincher uses a favoured technique; a flurry of inserts of sexually compromising photographs, lines of cocaine, and bloody tissues that just won't be flushed away. <br/><br/>The mystery of CBS, the corporation hired to change Nicholas' life, draws us naturally in like it does for him. Like any mystery, no one is determined to give him a straight answer. His brother Conrad remarks that it changed his life, as do several gentlemen at a club who have also been through the program. Their pleasantries hide a hint of menace and threat underneath and the possibilities stack up in Nicholas' mind: what possibly could be so mind blowing and life changing that could not be revealed in anything but cryptic dialogue? There is a particularly clever scene where it appears that they have infiltrated his TV and home, and the newscaster talks to him directly through the screen. It shows a voyeuristic angle of Nicholas in his room, and this is immediately frightening - more so once he discovers that he himself has brought the surveillance into his own home. The paranoia is ramped up significantly in the ease of which the actor disguises himself from the housemaid. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie cannot quite maintain this level of tension. What is initially complex and intriguing takes a route into a more confusing and muddled path that doesn't entirely add up. The script is dictated by those moments of shock that seek to disarm Nicholas and render him at his most vulnerable, and then again and again. It moves from plot development to plot development at a frenzied pace, never letting him completely breathe or react. It spends the majority of the film dismantling his entire private and public life, and is so obsessed with throwing plot twist after twist at Nicholas that there is little time devoted to the actual moral of the tale, to change his outlook on life and create a new person. We are simply supposed to accept that this series of traumatic and debilitating events will suddenly bring about a change in his miserable life - the resolution of It's a Wonderful Life tacked on to a mystery thriller. <br/><br/>The actors are a mixed bag. Douglas does well with what he is given to work with, and is almost believable as the broken man who has had everything stripped away from him. He is given no moment of eventual emotional catharsis and has to quickly switch from that destroyed identity to the birthday boy. There is little actual chemistry between the chosen female character who leads him towards the centre of the conspiracy, but the script is audacious enough to suggest an eventual romance anyway. And Penn, who flits in and out of the story as required, he feels less like a brother than someone who is playing a very cruel prank. After all, if a man is willingly driven to suicide, it takes more than a plot twist to rejuvenate his life. This is an okay thriller with barely any common sense, a weak back-story and little emotional backing. The second time around, there's not much to admire. And who the hell are all the people who bothered to turn up at his party? Isn't he supposed to be a miserable, uptight loner?"
"Screen_Blitz","7","0","1","22 November 2015"," The Game works good, but not as well as Fincher's previous film
","Director David Fincher shocked audiences everywhere with his dark and grim 1995 thriller 'Se7en' starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Fincher continues his ingenious twists and suspense with this mind-bending thriller that is less compelling, but retains the wit and energy of his style of direction. Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orten, an arrogant San Francisco financial investor living a lonely life . On his 48th birthday, Orten receives a gift from his younger brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn). His gift happens to be a key to a strange company named Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Upon visiting this company, Orten begins experiencing some strange and unfamiliar occurrences that alternates his life. With the help of a local woman named Christine (played by Deborah Kara Unger), he must solve the mystery behind what he believes his reality and what he believes is an illusion. <br/><br/>Being a fan of David Fincher's works, this is a film that I had to see. It is not as dark and somber as his previous film 'Se7en' and is a bit more complex in terms of storytelling, but still brings his decent directing style to the screen. This film offers something a little different than rookie detectives investigating murders and facing down a vicious serial killer. Playing almost like a two-hour episode of Twilight Zone, the plot blossoms with frequent twists and turns, and soaring thrills. Those who struggle to follow along with the challenging storyline however, may be left deprived from the film's suspense. Yes, comprehending the storyline can be a bit of a challenge at times. Nonetheless, the story stays strong and diligent for the most of the time, nearly every scene is almost impossible to predict. The main characters played by Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger are pretty solid and the performances are praise-worthy. Sean Penn who plays the younger brother who though offers some decent acting, is a bit underused for the most part. The film sustains itself strongly until it reaches its climax. At that point, the film falls pretty flat. <br/><br/>Overall, The Game is a decent movie while it last. It definitely doesn't level up to the ranks of David Fincher's other movies and does suffer from a few flaws. However, it is still a satisfying picture and most of what it needs to do."

","This film is very enjoyable, and may appear to be like no other story. However, viewers should be aware that there are striking similarities to a British TV mini-series from the late 1980's called The One Game. The makers of The Game do not appear to have acknowledged this in their credits. The plot of both is very similar, as is the relationship between the main character and his tormentor. Even the main character's name is similar! Both the film and the TV series are well worth seeing, though both have flaws in the plot, and rather stretch credulity!

","David Fincher's movies Fight Club and Se7en were two of the most badass, plot-twisty movies I've ever seen. This gave me high expectations for The Game. I wasn't disappointed, but took a few issues with the movie.<br/><br/>This movie has the same great camera work seen in Fincher's other movies. I noticed a few small issues with sound mixing/editing. Let the fact that I don't know the difference between mixing and editing say that it's not much of a problem. Still, if I see a guy jump over a wall, I want to hear a thudding noise when he lands. It's a blockbuster, come on.<br/><br/>Nicholas, the main character, is a selfish bastard at the beginning. We could have seen anyone in the world sign up for the game, but it's a banker. A rich guy. One of the proverbial one-percent-pigs. Understanding his back-story and father's suicide already makes Nicholas more of a real person, but he does actually change over the course of the film. It's not exactly bad-guy-to-nice-guy, but it's a believable change, considering what happens to him and a good choice of a character to put in ""the game.""<br/><br/>Having seen Fincher's other work, I expected a huge plot twist kind of ending. There are plot twists and reveals. A plot twist is when the whole film changes course (in a way that fits) at/close to the end. A reveal, which is expected from the start, is when the big mystery is solved. I expected a plot twist when a reveal is what I should have been waiting for. You can't predict a plot twist. Other than the fact that it was a reveal, I didn't personally care for the ending. It was not a bad ending. It was a solid ending. Everything concluded in the way it needed to, but I couldn't help thinking, ""that's not how I would have done it.""<br/><br/>The Game isn't Fincher's best movie, but it's not bad. That being said, I liked it much more than an ""eh, wasn't bad."" The Game follows Michael Douglas as a selfish banker who signs up for an ambiguous entertainment service. The movie does a great job making the audience question the reality of each event. Is it the game or not? Though I didn't really like the direction the ending took, I can't say it was a bad ending. The Game gets a 7.5 from me."

","""The Game"" is a 1997 thriller starring Michael Douglas. It was directed by David Fincher following his work on ""Se7en"". As a whole, I had a decent time watching the film. It began to drag a little during the second half and they could have probably cut 15-20 minutes (for example the whole Mexico part) and it would have been equally good or even better with a runtime under two hours. At some point, I felt that the whole scheme scenario simply got a bit repetitive and at the end, it was also one twist too many for my taste when he ""shot"" his brother. That brother is played by Sean Penn shortly after his very first Academy Award nomination. The female main character is played by Deborah Kara Unger in her probably most known role. She disappeared from the limelight quickly unlike Penn and Douglas. Other than that, the far too early deceased James Rebhorn plays one of the bigger roles as well and I quite enjoyed watching him here.<br/><br/>My favorite scene of the film is probably the ""White Rabbit"" scene. The song is great and fit the tone and visuals of the return of the main character to his house just perfectly. The newscaster speaking to Douglas' character was a nice inclusion as well. I am a bit surprised this film did not get any awards attention at all. Fincher was very famous at that point already. However, I have to say that I had quite a few problems with the whole plot. There were a handful scenes that they could not have foreseen his actions entirely and yet it was supposed to look like they always had everything under control. And let's not forget the risk factor. If the Game was common for upper class, there must have been some kind of accident in the past if they risk the ""players"" having guns or to almost drown in their cars. People would have sued this company a hundred times already I guess. So, yeah, it is a truly unrealistic film for more reasons than one. But if you manage to look past that, you can still have a pretty good time. Nonetheless I have to say, I was slightly unimpressed with Douglas here. Given the fact we see the film completely from his perspective and he is in absolutely every scene from start to finish for two hours, his performance did not wow me the way I had hoped.<br/><br/>As a whole, Brancato and Ferris did a solid job with the script (also Douglas' character's transformation from being the grinch he is early on into who he is at the end), especially looking at the fact that they are the ones behind ""Catwoman"". It is by no means flawless, but certainly has its strengths. The movie itself can be described just like that. Recommended."

","You've got something if you can slowly ratchet up the tension and keep us guessing until the last minute, but David Fincher's The Game is essentially a high-value shaggy dog story. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but in my book a film has slightly missed the point if you can't watch it again and again.<br/><br/>Well, of course, you could watch The Game again and again, but once you know how it all ends, doing so becomes a little pointless. Then there's the danger that whereas the first time round we are sitting on the edges of our seats wondering where Michael Douglas's bad luck will take him next and, not least, what the hell is it all about, at second, third and maybe even fourth viewings - and knowing full well how it all plays out - the viewer will start picking holes here, there and everywhere. That would be unfair, of course, but that's exactly what we would do.<br/><br/>But what the hell: you are either reading this wondering whether is worth your time taking a gander, in which case I say unequivocally 'go for it'. Or you have seen it, have your own view about how good a film it is and are wondering what others made of it. In that case, you probably agree with me that it's worth the ride, but starts to lose on points the more you reflect on it.<br/><br/>I, too, have been looking at the opinions of others, and should warn the first-time viewer that although it is all hugely enjoyable and intriguing, it is, at the end of the day, just a piece of very well-made, thoroughly gripping hooey. Great filmmaking it ain't."

It could've really been interesting in setting up certain scenes and scenarios, but it really didn't do much.

","With David Fincher, you are always guaranteed to have many thrills, a few twists, and a well put together film. Fincher is one of the best directors of this generation and probably the best Mystery-Thriller director working today. The Game has a similar feel to most of his other films but is unique enough to be memorable. Unfortunately I was looking for an ending that stunned me to pieces just as Fight Club and Se7en did. It didn't leave me wanting more answers and wanting to put the film right back into the Blu-ray player like most other Fincher films had. But it was a good film, and one of the more interesting stories put together on screen.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas is one of those actors that I'm never jumping out of my seat to see because of various reasons. But he is terrific in The Game. Watching him discover secrets and clues was all the more thrilling with his top notch acting. The supporting cast is fine, but I thought Sean Penn may have a bigger role. It's also a movie that I hoped the solution and the final answer to 'the game' wouldn't be so simple. But in fact in the end it was. It really was all just a game which seemed like too easy of a solution. Especially because of the amount of times Michael Douglas' life was in serious danger. It was all to just get Michael Douglas to enjoy life a little more and not end up like the father, which I understand but I would have liked something a bit more thought out. I realize you have to suspend your disbelief while watching these types of movies but it just took me out of it. For a movie that I couldn't keep my eyes and ears from it the whole film, it just disappointed me in the end. A great ending can save a movie for me but a bad one doesn't kill it.<br/><br/>I think The Game is a movie that doesn't require multiple viewings because of the simple solution but it may be worth it because of the incredible writing and directing from Fincher. It's not one of his best, but every director has a slight misstep. I look forward to seeing what Fincher does with the best selling book 'Gone Girl' this fall. It's about time this man gets an Oscar.<br/><br/>+Douglas <br/><br/>+Gripping story, eye popping <br/><br/>+Fincher tone and writing <br/><br/>-Ending is a big disappointment <br/><br/>-Douglas was put into too many dangerous situations for my liking <br/><br/>7.1/10"

","This film has a very a interesting story about a banker, containing some possible 9/11 references.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of quotes I picked up...<br/><br/>Christine.. ""It's all a game .. special effects like squib squibs (sounds like squibs was mentioned twice?) in the movies""<br/><br/>Nicholas.. ""....sheer some more sheep""<br/><br/>The first quote was just before while the second quote just after the scene of the main character throwing himself off the top of a skyscraper near the end of the movie, while both quotes seemed odd and slightly out of context unless the film is viewed after 9/11 and then they make sense.<br/><br/>The subtext has many meanings. I think one of the meanings is how Nicholas Van Orton's ""birthday surprise"" had been planned by a corporation, with lots of tragic events leading up to his jump off the skyscraper. This had been orchestrated by large number of people without them all being aware of the true outcome, this being four years before and mirroring the events on 9/11, and possible during the planning stages thus through very intricate planning anything can be made believable."

","The Game is one of my favorite movies of all time for one specific reason - Michael Douglas. This film would not have worked with any other actor. Not only does he play brooding wealth and privilege at its best - he digs deep within the character's arsenal of emotions and pulls out the man he should have been. The turning point of the Character begins after he believes his wealth, privilege and power have all been stripped. He awakens in a coffin which is symbolic of rebirth or reincarnation then relieves himself of his Father's watch to travel home. The final crescendo is reached after the ""death"" scene with his brother played by Sean Penn. The realization of his ""death"" drives him to the greatest sorrow in his life and plunges from the roof of the building towards the streets. Memories flood his conscious as he falls and he gives into the loss. Upon the realization his brother is alive his heart is open and accepts the lesson of the The Game - you can not take wealth, power or influence into your death but you can live life to its highest as long as you treasure your family, friends and have a little fun. Money, power, wealth and all those finer things are empty when compared to the truth in friendship, family and living life to the fullest. The Game teaches us that everyone is significant from your waiter to your family. Everyone in your life deserves respect and acknowledgment because you never know when you may need them. From a simple task in life to actually saving it. <br/><br/>As a closing scene, we all wonder does he take the invite to the airport (risk) or go back to the party where it is safe. Let's imagine he goes to the airport and gives into love. (smile)."

I've seen this one about 7 times and never have the people i've seen it with been able to guess the end, and that is what i call impressive, especially since this movie clearly states just by its title that the audience should try and figure out the ending.<br/><br/>Michare Douglas plays a character that i would go as far as to say that no one ever could do better. He's rich, powerful and very much alone, and how many actors can take such a big part of a movie and not make it boring? I'm not gonna write much about the movie, cause i don't want anyone reading this to get some hints ;).<br/><br/>This is a serious movie, not a comedy.

Actually there is a big mistake right at the beginning. We're expected to believe that Nicholas would actually agree to all these tests AND a physical. No way. It doesn't fit his character at all. I was able to accept that though. Then at the end, when we find out it was just a big joke, the movie falls to pieces. There is no possible way all of this could have been planned out. Are we supposed to believe the whole city of San Francisco would just go along with everything? Virtually all of the coincidences couldn't have been possibly been set up. Also there are more than a few moments where people could have died! And really--they take him all the way to Mexico, put him in a grave and expect him to come out of there ALIVE??? Come on!

Douglas and Penn are both good and Deborah Kara Unger is excellent as a woman who gets involved in all this.

"Supachewy","6","0","1","12 December 2010"," The Game is Fun but it Isn't Fincher's Best
","The psychological thriller The Game is directed by David Fincher and stars Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. The film takes place in modern day San Francisco.<br/><br/>Nicholas Van Orten (Douglas) is a very successful business man who lives alone and is very depressed. He used to be married and does not have a very close relationship with his brother, Conrad (Penn). On Nicholas's birthday he remembers how his father killed himself when he turned forty eight. But on Nicholas's birthday his brother gives him a gift that is from a company known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). What this company provides is a game that will control your life and promises a thrilling experience that you've never felt before. But it gets a little bit too thrilling...<br/><br/>John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris wrote the screenplay for this psychological thriller, and it was a little bit too outrageous. It still is a very fun and entertaining ride but it requires you to not think too deeply about what the company needs to be doing for all of this to be happening. I will not go over all the ridiculous things that happen that make this film illogical because there are too many to count, but like I said if you forget about them it is a fun film. Also, this film is purely plot driven, the characters are very one dimensional. In all psychological thrillers there is some sort of twist and in this one there are many as well and they are satisfying, especially the final one. <br/><br/>David Fincher is one of the biggest directors of today but this film was only his third feature and it did not have as much intensity and grittiness as his previous film Se7en. None of the shots in this film were all that impressive, but the sequencing of the shots kept me fascinated the whole way through the film. Fincher grew much as a director since this film and I would even claim that he is one of the best of his generation. But this film is not the reason why he is considered that at all, he became a cult favorite from Se7en and Fight Club then went on to start making more wide spread audience films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and the recent The Social Network. His film repertoire is very impressive and it is enjoyable to see one of his early works such as this film and see how he has grown from it.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas plays the lead of Nicholas Van Orten and even though the character is one dimensional he embodies the role quite well. He sort of plays a sad Gordon Gekko but does not have the great lines that Gekko had. He was very believable in the role but again this is not something that he will be remembered for when talking about why Michael Douglas is a very successful actor.<br/><br/>Sean Penn does not have a major part in this film but he is still in it for a little bit as Nicholas's brother Conrad. When Nicholas and Conrad are running from the CRS and Conrad has sort of a paranoid nervous breakdown Penn is quite good, even though it is nothing compared to the many brilliant performances of his career. When I think Sean Penn I think Milk, Mystic River, and his comedic performance in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, not this film even though he is good, like Douglas.<br/><br/>Deborah Kara Unger plays a waitress named Christine that Nicholas drags into his game. As the film goes on it is hard to determine if she is trying to help Nicholas or if she is working with the CRS. Her performance is alright, but nothing really memorable. I can't even cite a scene in the movie where she was good, it was just her character that was interesting.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 6/10, because it is a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the dramatic finale. None of the qualities of the film are great, but they are all decent. I would recommend this to fans of Fincher, psychological thrillers, or I guess dark films with a twist."
"eddiez61","7","0","1","9 December 2010"," I haven't watched it yet, but I bet it's good. Not Great, but good.
","How can I declare that ""The Game"" will be good, but not great, before I have seen it? By reading other people's comments. The common theme of most of these comments is that ""The Game"" is a clever, if outrageous, fantasy driven by fine performances from its stars, Michael Douglas - who I have always found to be engaging and believable - and Sean Penn, who is often very effective, but can also be overly theatrical and oddly self conscious. Somehow Sean manages to convey intense discomfort and boundless confidence simultaneously. It's actually kinda weird. In fact, I find Sean to be a weird person - a curious mix of contradictions and clichés. He rails against the abuse and despoliation of our natural wilderness, but he smokes cigarettes furiously. He demands to be acknowledged as a gifted profound artist, but is keen to develop his persona as an ""everyman."" If he ever manages to stop ""acting"" - whether in a film, or while being interviewed, or on the location of the latest natural disaster - he suddenly becomes powerfully effective, but those moments are few and far between. He too often comes across as self centered and smug. That's a problem with emotionally fragile personalities - they're afraid to just be themselves.<br/><br/>OK, so now I've trashed Sean Penn without having yet seen his performance. No doubt we can all agree that prejudice is a shameful vice, so I should probably refrain from any more blind conjecture, but this is my dilemma. Should I risk 129 minutes of my so very(?!?) valuable time on a Sean Penn vehicle, wagering that I haven't once again been duped into a another frivolous disappointing distraction? It's a risk, it seems, I'm willing to take if the overall experience is something that at least rates as ""pretty good."" If I'm right about my hunch on this flick then I'll leave this comment intact after I watch ""The Game."" If I'm wrong, then I'll add a note correcting my premature condemnation. Maybe I'll be back, maybe not. It's up to Sean..."

David Fincher's direction is impeccable."

","In ""The Game,"" Michael Douglas plays Nicholas, a cold and unlikeable investment banker who is in desperate need of a life-lesson. Enter his brother, Conrad, played by Sean Penn. As a birthday present, Conrad sets Nicholas up with a mysterious company that intends to play a high-concept, high-risk game with his life. The end results promise a life-changing experience, but when things get too real too quick and as it gets harder and harder to tell where the game ends and where it begins, Nicholas begins to lose his grip on reality and on himself.<br/><br/>The film, directed by David Fincher (""Se7en"") is a stylish and moody piece, with the director's strong visual sense in full-form. Although the film never quite nails a specific tone (thanks, in part, to its flawed script) it is anchored greatly by Michael Douglas, who keeps us attached to a character who is rather unpleasant on the whole. Along the way, he makes acquaintances with a beautiful waitress (Deborah Kara Unger) and survives gun-fights, car crashes, a trip to Mexico and a fall from a very tall building. Is his life falling apart, or is this just all part of the elaborate game he entered? You can't help but shout at the screen because it is so blatantly obvious where the film is manipulating us. Thus, the film's biggest flaw: It doesn't leave much to the imagination.<br/><br/>Those seeking a well-made thriller will at least find some goodies with ""The Game."" Even if you reach its conclusion before its running time is over, you'll at least remain engaged in watching Nicholas' redemption while Fincher's style makes for an impressive looking film regardless of plot-points.

","The best thrillers have two things: growing tension and an unpredictable plot. David Fincher's masterpiece has that, and something that few thrillers, even the best ones, have: the belief that anything can happen at any time. Quite frankly, this is one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a millionaire who's life is perfect. He's fabulously wealthy, and although he's divorced, his ex-wife still calls him on his birthday. A day late, his deadbeat brother Conrad (Sean Penn) shows up and hands him a birthday present: an invitation to participate in a game offered by Consumer Recreation Services.<br/><br/>More than that, I cannot and will not say. Let me just say this: never let your guard down while watching this movie. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, or when you think Nick is safe (for the time being), the film pulls a fast one, and everything you thought you knew changed. It's a one-of-a-kind experience when a thriller is so skillfully put together that you can't rely on the thriller to stay on the traditional rhythm.<br/><br/>From an acting standpoint, the only performance that really matters is Michael Douglas; everyone else is strictly supporting. Douglas is a master at playing cold, hard, ruthless businessmen, and Nicholas Van Orton is right up his alley. Connections to Gordon Gekko are eerily similar, except that Nick is sympathetic, while Gekko was deliciously villainous. Support is ably provided by Sean Penn, and character actors Deborah Kara Unger and James Rebhorn. All are perfectly cast, although Sean Penn is especially interesting; we really believe that Conrad and Nick are brothers. The film's handling of the villain, Consumer Recreation Services, is brilliant. Faceless, non-speaking villains are difficult to pull off effectively, but when they work, they are frightening. We never know what to expect from CRS, or when.<br/><br/>The real star of ""The Game,"" however, is David Fincher. With every film, the former music video director gets better every time. Although I liked ""Seven,"" it doesn't hold a candle to this one. This is Hitchcock for the 90's. It is perfectly paced, and the suspense rarely lets up.<br/><br/>Don't miss it!"
"thesar-2","9","0","1","17 December 2009"," I'm not much of a video-game player, but I would love to play this GAME
","(Despite my efforts, this review contains spoilers. Please completely avoid reading this, or ANY review, until you see it. But to sum up my own review: YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. Okay, then read my review. At least, I didn't say you MUST READ MY REVIEW. That part's optional.) The Game was very close to receiving the rare 5/5 star rating. What held it back to 4½ stars was the very ending, meaning the last 1½ minutes that were slightly ""off"" and the repeat-viewing dilemma. I'll explain: The entire movie is one surprise after another leading up to a shocking finale and after one viewing, the entire suspense is, well, gone. And I'm not talking about just finding out Luke is Darth's son or the ending to Planet of the Apes. Heck, Fight Club also enjoyed its twist ending, but regardless of that revelation, you can watch that over and over. In this case, we're talking the entire movie.<br/><br/>Whew, the negative I hate to start on, is over. The Game is a great, suspenseful, fun, ingenious, crafty and original film. It's also funny, namely in the beginning. And to top it off, it's got excellent performances from both Unger and Douglas – who rarely lets me down. In fact, this is one of the top five best movies he's done. In a role that could've been easily played by someone ""confused"" on what was going on, Douglas added so much depth. You think you know him as a ruthless, soulless Wall Street tycoon, who's used to bullying people to his own needs, but as he breaks down in this movie, you really see the onion being peeled. In fact, I think the most underrated aspect of this movie, as good as the whole was, was Douglas's masterful performance as a lost soul who needs it back.<br/><br/>Douglas plays Nicholas, someone so rich (through both inheritance and his own determination later in life as a huge multibillion-dollar money-pusher) that even Bruce Wayne would ask him for a loan. It's shown early on that his father took his own life, I guess greed is not always, for lack of a better term, good. Nicholas is stuck fathering the young brother who grows into Penn, or Conrad. Due to these critical plot points – no spoiler, this is like in the first few minutes – Nicky never has a childhood, nor enjoyed life. But Conrad sure as heck did.<br/><br/>In what seems like a normal rehab, begging for money visit from Conrad, Nicholas is presented a gift from CRS from Conrad. Reluctantly, Nicholas coincidentally falls right into the CRS office and begins, what else?, the GAME.<br/><br/>The movie then turns very Total Recall-ish, but saved by reality and the real-life settings (all over the continent) and performances. Nicholas doesn't know what is real, or what is fake, neither does the audience who just sat back to enjoy the enormously fun ride Nicholas has to endure to solve or even survive the GAME.<br/><br/>Nicholas eventually befriends Christine (Unger) who may/may not know what's going on. When I say befriends, I mean, he thinks she's part of the gameHeck, it's hard to give anything away. Just watch this movie. Anything I reveal can be considered a spoiler. So, if you like mystery, suspense, action, adventure, Douglas and the great style and art of Director Fincher, you must watch this movie and explore and be intrigued by every minute, turn, twist and revolution.<br/><br/>Side Note: I wish I could go on, namely how unrealistic I found everything to be the first time. Really think about it when you finish, think about the tests andI've said too much. Watch this movie!"
"Ziya90","10","0","2","25 November 2009"," One of the best movies of all time in spite of some negative criticisms
","The plot of the movie is one of the most mysterious and surprising ones so far and I think about it, the recently made movies with plot twists such as The Machinist is nothing in comparison with The Game. The plot may be summarized as for his birthday gift by his brother, a businessman is engaged in an organization that arranges games in exchange for money, but soon he realizes that it is not a game. The Game is an underrated movie which in contrast, according to some audiences overrated. Besides very smart plot, the things make the movie an excellent masterpiece are Fincher's story telling, music causes mystery, atmosphere and Michael Douglas. I believe that it is an easy role may be, but Douglas seems the best choice for this role. After watching the final scene, every detail, every dialog, every event require re-interpreting. One of the best twists so far. Even just the relationship between Nicholas and Christine makes the movie enigmatic. Is Christine a femme fatale who then decides to help him? Is she a femme fatale pretends to be a good girl? or Is she a bait? Another point, Fincher reflects Van Orton's nightmarish situation perfectly also with a very stylish direction. Unbelievably, some people say that it is a plain story, the movie's theme is know the value of life. This is just an interpretation and no need to say that it is much more than that. Let's remember It's a Wonderful Life. The Game and that film are extremely different from each other, but the thing I try to say is that if we look from this point of view, the movie's theme is the same, know the value of life, in spite of the challenges, don't give up etc. but does this simple theme make the movie weak? It's a Wonderful Life is a great movie. Therefore, as said, the very consistent script, the plot, Fincher's story telling and direction, the very successful atmosphere, music and Douglas's persona make the film great and Sean Penn is our bonus. I like the final and cannot see any wrong or simple point. When I watched it first in 1997, the reaction in the final made me seriously bothered, that's why a lot of people dislike the movie, they say it ruins the movie, but I don't see it as a flaw or call it a bad ending, if you ask me, it was a bit frustrating. It is just like if I was him, I would not do what he does. The Game is one of the movies of my life."

","The mere title ""The Game"" suggests a sort of fabrication for our entertainment, and that is precisely what this film does. From the first cue to the final fade out, ""The Game"" is created for the sole purpose of giving its plot-sniffing audience something to mull over and over again amidst a series of 180-degree twists and turns. It is the very pinpoint definition of the thriller genre. Other films mix thriller with drama or action/adventure, but ""The Game"" provides neither of these to any real extent and instead opts to be the finest example of exploiting an audience's love for the guessing game.<br/><br/>""The Game"" is entertaining. Michael Douglas gets all dressed up for us Gordon Gekko style again and tries to unravel a dangerous real life mystery that envelops him after agreeing to an unusual birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn). From the moment we hear about the game we're completely hooked on trying to figure out what it is. It's a film that knows it has us right in its grasp the entire time and it fully exploits this fact -- we will not stop watching until we have the answers.<br/><br/>The irony here is that this game is created for the person, in this case Douglas' character, and for the audience, this movie is tailored much the same way. That might seem clever, but unless the biggest ""try to figure it out"" puzzle is all you hope for in film -- no serious character development, resolved subplots, flawless logic -- then truth is ""The Game"" is a bit insulting.<br/><br/>Writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris show a serious lack of respect for their audience. Sure, some people who watch this movie will forgive their sins because excessive plot twists excite them more than anything in cinema, but many watchers will feel insulted. Without getting into spoiler detail, ""The Game"" is riddled with plot holes and begs of you to suspend your disbelief out of sheer desire to figure out what's going on. Brancato and Ferris expect us to neglect our interest in the film's characters and in meaningful storytelling for some fancy plot writing. They underestimate us. They only haphazardly answer all the questions raised in the film, thinking we'll be happy if we just learn the truth behind it all.<br/><br/>Few films will hold your attention and curiosity from start to finish like ""The Game,"" but any hope that there's more in it for you than amusement would be best discarded before viewing. This is a thriller movie and everyone making it, even the excellent director David Fincher (""Se7en""), knows it."

It seems that the film is driven by its own arrogance, it bypasses gaping holes in order to run across a finish line which has no audience.<br/><br/>The story is a meshing of twists and bluffs that I'm afraid are just silly, the film does not surprise, as I'm sure it was meant to, nor act as a taut tense thriller, as I'm sure it was meant to. Mere average."

","I read descriptions of the this film calling it a masterpiece and was compelled to comment. Whilst a great film on first watching, a masterpiece it is not...Whilst the Seven director did his best to draw out the suspense you could not really watch the later parts of this film without thinking...this is all a game. Whilst the end is powerful and gripping, you're still telling yourself in the back of the mind...this is all a game. And there is the problem. Only with a few fleeting moments do you really think this could be something more sinister, which was a trick missed i feel. This could have transpired into a wicked heist film.

","A Kafkaesque atmosphere and a very good acting. Exploration of illusions, desires and the human limits. Illustration of old Calderon de la Barca ""The life is dream"". Analys of truth and memories, connection between facts and shadows of fear, fragility of truth and social statute, ambiguous contact with the other and traumas. A great film for tension, script and a brilliant Michael Douglas falling in a different world. Only problem- the end. The happy-end as ordinary solution but a real error in this case. A joke after a beautiful story for save the appearances. After the father's gesture, the party. A moral solution for a surrealistic show. And yet, a subtle pledge for search of existence's sense and for understand the world as a huge puzzle in which every piece is projection of a secret desire."

","I'll be up front and honest. I really wanted to like this film. In case you haven't seen the film, or you have forgotten what ""The Game"" is all about, let me run over the plot quickly.<br/><br/>The film is about a prominent and wealthy investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton (played by Michael Douglas, who throws his usual punch and panache into the role). Nicholas is a smarmy, arrogant man who doesn't really care about many things other than his job, but when his brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) gives him an invitation to play a real-world ""game"" on his birthday, Michael decides to try it out for fun. Obviously, it's not everything Nicholas had planned for. What follows are shoot-outs, explosions and multiple twists as Nicholas tries to figure out who stole all his money, who framed him, and how he can get back at those who wronged him.<br/><br/>So what did I think of the film? Well, the acting, cinematography and direction are all first-rate. You couldn't a better cast if you tried. Douglas, Penn, and Deborah Unger all give great performances, and you'll find yourself guessing for quite some time. The only problem I had with the film is the ridiculously illogical ending that hinges on a completely different set of variables. Basically, Nicholas goes to the Consumer Recreation Services building (the company who owns the game) and holds Deborah Unger's character hostage on a rooftop, then he accidentally shoots his brother by mistake when he comes up to talk to him, which prompts Nicholas to jump off a roof, fall through a skylight, and land in a specifically positioned air mattress. And then, he is told that the whole game was a ruse and he was being watched and monitored at all times. However, that completely invalidates half of the game. We are asked to believe that the bullets which were shot at Nicholas and Christine by the assassins (that blow holes in doors and vehicles) are blanks; that Nicholas could get back to the U.S. without money or aid; that he had to stand at a precise location to fall through the skylight and hit the air mattress; that the company would specifically ask Jim Feingold and his children to put themselves in harm's way because Nicholas is coming to find and kill him; that Nicholas would go careening down a San Francisco street at night without being hit by vehicles, and subsequently being able to figure out how to get out of the sinking car; that a company can complete major renovations in under a couple of days; and even that news reporters, relatives, fellow employees, and even American embassy employees are all acting as part of the game. It makes the preceding story completely unbelievable, and drags the film down.<br/><br/>Another problem I had is that the film just wraps up so cleanly. Nicholas is not at all depressed or angry about anything that has happened to him. They tell him that he beat the game and he just wears this s***-eating grin on his face like he loves life. Maybe he was happy when he was being shot at? I don't know.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Despite the ending, the greater sum of the parts is enough for me to recommend this movie. I give this film a 7 out of 10. Go pick it up if you have a chance."
"notsotame","5","0","4","26 November 2005"," Fincher, you maggot, I don't love you anymore
","Up till last Friday I was convinced that David Fincher can do no wrong. 'Se7en' is mind-blowing. 'Fight Club' is quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. 'Panic Room', while not as excellent, is still a highly entertaining thriller. Well, there is also 'Alien 3'. I saw it a long time ago and all I remember is that it takes place in a prison this time. As if Ripley hadn't had enough already. I'm pretty sure I liked it, though. I was... twelve? I liked almost everything then. But it's perfectly likely that the movie is genuinely good on its own. I just don't remember. Anyway, I think 'Alien 3' can be safely excluded from the count. IMDb claims that Fincher left the production early owing to a conflict with the studio and practically disowned the movie.<br/><br/>So, 'Se7en', 'Fight Club' and 'Panic Room'. Three high scores. 75% of Fincher's whole filmography. It wasn't much of a leap to presume that his only movie that I had NOT seen yet, would be just as good. The higher the expectations, the more bitter the disappointment. Fincher won't have it easy to earn my trust back. 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club' are still brilliant, nothing will ever change that, but the implicit faith I had in the man took a very hard blow.<br/><br/>Actually I can't really say that it's such a bad movie. It's far far away from the disasters of 'Elektra' or 'Battlefield Earth' calibre (there are probably oodles of non-sf and non-comic-book bad movies but I pointedly avoid any contact with them; I'm a science-fiction junkie so I'm willing to see it even at its absolute lowest, but when other genres are concerned, my standards are still in fully working order). So far away, that it might as well be in a different galaxy. It's never boring. There is the always-present tension, definitely Fincher's forte. Michael Douglas is unquestionably well-suited for the role and holds his own quite nicely. The premise of such thorough manipulation of reality and how said manipulation can make a remarkably intelligent and successful man completely lose his bearing and start operating almost solely on instinct, is certainly noteworthy.<br/><br/>It doesn't change the fact, that 'The Game' is one of the most irritating movies that I've ever seen. The plot is so ridiculously far-fetched, the stunt brought to such absurd level, that the movie has totally no credibility.<br/><br/>The Game, an extraordinarily complicated and actually life-threatening role play, is based only on a personality test. Sorry, but I just don't buy it. Granted, it's a very comprehensive personality test, but even giving it the benefit of doubt and kindly assuming that such accurate analysis and resulting behaviour predictions are possible, there are also some environmental factors, depending purely on coincidence, that simply cannot be controlled. What if Michael Douglas decided to jump off the roof from a place five metres to the left? It looked exactly the same. Well, not that it really matters so much, I'm still lost at the personality test stage.<br/><br/>Besides the scale of the whole show is completely unbelievable. It involves dozens of people. It requires assistance from various institutions, even those of public service (like the embassy in Mexico). Breaking into the main character's house and vandalizing it, staging his killing his own brother, manipulating the TV transmissions, it all seem much too extreme to be meant just for amusement. It would be much more plausible if the mysterious SRC (CRS?) company was really after Micheal Douglas' lots and lots of millions. A colossal amount of money is the only thing that I could imagine to possibly make people go to such lengths. OK, they drew a very impressive bill at the end, but it was surely nowhere near the size of main character's bank account.<br/><br/>Then ending is undoubtedly surprising, but not in a good way. The happy-end seems forced. It doesn't really fit. It certainly is the least lousy option for Micheal Douglas, but it's destructive for the movie. It's as if the air suddenly came out of the figurative balloon. You feel bewildered, cheated and slightly outraged, that the fun has ended too soon and not how it supposed to.<br/><br/>The last half an hour is by far the most annoying part of the movie. The plot executes a shocking twist every five minutes, completely changing the whole perspective and leaving the audience just as dumbstruck as the main character must feel. That's probably the result Fincher was going for - to befuddle the audience totally and without mercy. It's really effective, I have to give him that. It's just that every time the story made a sudden swerve in an entirely new direction, I kept expecting Fincher to just jump on screen, yell 'Fooled you AGAIN!' and start cackling evilly. I can't say that it was a particularly pleasant feeling. Made the badness of the ending hit even harder. Shame on you, Fincher.<br/><br/>Now it's just Tarantino left. Four movies, four wins. My only constant in the movie universe. Oh oh wait, there's Darren Aronofsky, too. So perhaps the world isn't such a dark and hopeless place, after all. Quite a relief, actually."

","A pretty good psychological thriller. Michael Douglas turns in his usual outstanding performance, but then, hey, he's got the genes. The plot is sort of an archetypal one of being manipulated and controlled by unseen forces. Sean Penn is quite good in a small part. Penn is a phenomenal actor, as much as it pains me to say so. Everyone knows his attachment to the political loony left, and this detracts some enjoyment from seeing him ply his craft. He, of course, has freedom of speech, and can say what he pleases, but in the old Hollywood days, the studio moguls kept their biggest stars away from political issues for just this sort of reason. But anyway, check out ""The Game"". It's worth a rental."

Personally its one of my favourites of all time- the story line and characters are just fun to watch= the chilling music score is perfect and the director captures the concept very well.

"hakapes","7","0","1","21 May 2005"," Twisting the twist
","The reason to watch this movie was Michael Douglas (Nicholas Von Orton) and no problem there as he made a very strong performance throughout. He just doesn't know what's going on as I didn't. Every 10 minutes the story gets a twist and says that all things previously seen are fake, now is the moment of the truth. Then in another ten minutes, again and again and again. In fact, in the end I got a bit tired of this and the constant change was not so entertaining. I watched the last 20 minutes only for sake of curiosity, to know what will be the final solution, which was original indeed. I think less twist would have been more, with more development of Nicholas' character, description of the plots. That way it would worth a second watch for me, this way it was just a fast moving funny action movie.<br/><br/>About the idea of 'The Game' - funnily the movie started me to think after a bit - this whole idea is so strange for me. First, it is so awkward that you need hundreds of people and millions of dollars and an incredibly strong impact on your personality to make you a shock and discover 'where life is' and come back to reality. Second, when you constantly discover, that everything previously experienced was a setup, when you showed true emotions and reactions others were just playing around you, when killing your brother was a fake and even your own suicide was a fake - then I think to loose ground and simply my personality would crash. I would no longer be able to trust anyone and any experience because I would constantly doubt whether this is part of a setup or is this 'real'. Authenticity is very important to me in my personal relations, and when someone plays with emotions and trust, all I can do is to let my walls fall build up suddenly, put on my mask, and keep all authentic feelings and reactions inside, and just give a smile to The outer world. Living such a way for a long time would be really a nightmare for me.<br/><br/>However, I like the idea of Mother Theresa and Sai Baba, who said ""Life is a game. Play it."" - though the words are similar, somehow that is such a different approach to life than what is presented in the movie ""The Game""."

","Although in the end it all seems a bit too silly and far-fetched, this is a compelling thriller nevertheless for most of the time. It is able to shock, surprise, and make one think, and David Fincher shows that he has a sure hand when it comes to creating just the right atmosphere. As long as one can suspend one's disbelief for a couple of hours, the film is a thrilling ride, full of twists, turns and interesting tricks. It is all about tricking the viewer and less about exploring the drone life of a millionaire, but it does touch on such issues, and even if does not deeply examine them, there is enough in thrills, chills and style to keep one watching."

","Anyone loving mysteries will love this movie, ""The Game"". It truly keeps you guessing until the rolling credits at the end.

In both, a brother wants to give his brother an exciting birthday ""present"": the giving brother hires a theatrical group to secretly entertain his brother on his birthday. Along the way, however, things go horribly awry from the planned script. Through most of the movie, the brother being entertained doesn't know exactly what is happening to them, except in Bill Murray's case, he was told that he would be dealing with a theatrical group, but winds up in a ""real"" spy story, thinking all along he is still dealing with actors. While in Michael Douglas' case, he doesn't know what is going on for sure. I would watch both movies. They both are quite entertaining."
"BarneyTabasco","6","0","1","8 October 2004"," Great idea doesn't make a great movie
","David Fincher has proved that given a taut script, he will turn it into a great movie. Seven proved this and, to a lesser extent, David Koepp's Panic Room. Two of his movies, Fight Club and, this, The Game, prove that he can't quite turn a great idea into a great movie.<br/><br/>The premise of The Game is fine: a mischievous brother of a bored businessman finds a company that offers the customer a roller-coaster ride of an experience...but in the real-world rather than in a theme park. The brother buys him the ""ride"" as a birthday present.<br/><br/>The movie does reach a natural conclusion, but it has too much implausibility to get there. It seems as if the script was tweaked at the last moment to either ratchet up the excitement or to simply get the audience to ask themselves, ""how will our hero get himself out of this now?"". In the end, the audience will probably feel cheated by the answer. Perhaps if it didn't quite take itself so seriously, then I might have let it get away with it a bit.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas is most certainly not extending his acting talent here. He plays the man-in-peril so well now and, as he gets to play it so seriously (and leave his pants on), you wonder if working with Fincher was the real reason he got involved with this. Still, you can't help think that Douglas was left scratching his head at the whole thing.<br/><br/>Sean Penn is criminally underused as Douglas' brother. Penn plays his part so less straight-faced than Douglas that you almost expect him to give you a knowing wink. Perhaps Penn hoped that the rest of the cast and crew would treat it the same way as he obviously did.<br/><br/>The Game, though, is an extremely well-made film. Fincher manages to incorporate some ingenuity (the clever car-into-the-water sequence) and craftsmanship to the proceedings. Undoubtedly, Fincher will make some great films in his career, but let's hope he picks his scripts carefully.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."

If you've ever played a pen and paper RPG (bear with me here), or improvised on stage, you'd understand.  There are situations and clues and things but I think the game was capable of branching at certain points.  And if you notice Nick is always steered in one direction or another.  Other reviews complain about how unlikely it is that Nick wouldn't kill himself.  I dunno.  The psych test they give him looks pretty complete.  What's to say they would know what he does?

On the contrary, maybe it was the fact that the first seven eighths of the movie was so impressive.<br/><br/>The movie exhibits all the cinematic style and flair of Director David Fincher's other efforts; viewers will notice the use of murky lighting and largely night-time scenes used in Fincher's successors, ""Seven"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Panic Room"" to create a unique brand of menace and suspense. While ""The Game"" contains the necessary plot twists and the application of Michael Douglas in this role is a case of casting perfection, the film does not quite carry off the synergy of plot and direction towards as powerful a conclusion as, say, that in Fight Club.<br/><br/>But I AM being picky here. The pace is far from inert; there is plenty of action and there is more than enough happening in the story to keep you in suspense without requiring much concentration from the viewer.<br/><br/>Despite the odd (minor) errors in continuity and the final scenes making a rather hurried attempt to tie some of the pieces together (and answer your questions) there is rather little to criticise. If this is your first time, chances are you won't pick the ending, but it almost seems as though you weren't meant to in the first place. Sean Penn turns in a commendable, dynamic role as Douglas' brother in the film, and there are no overt blemishes in the acting of the other characters.<br/><br/>If you're not desperately after the mind-warping in-your-face vivacity of Fight Club but you want a little more substance; a more satisfying and climactic ending than that of Panic Room, you can't go wrong here."

","Another student brought this into my film studies class because he was studying David Fincher as an auteur, and without thinking about who the director was I looked at the box art (a picture of Michael Douglas) and made a very premature assumption of the quality of the film. We had the choice of either watching this or ""Seven"", and I was quietly wishing he had chosen Seven.<br/><br/>Fortunately, very early into the film I became hooked. From the start, the plot was fantastic and every time a new twist in the plot unfolded I became hooked even more. Then, disaster struck. The lesson was only and hour long and I had to stop watching. I'm a student with no money - how was I supposed to get this film so I could see the second half!? The part of this film I'd watched amazed and intrigued me so much that I had to find a copy of this film any way I could.<br/><br/>That night, I was going to rent the DVD at Blockbuster - something which I rarely do because it's so costly. When I was on my way there, my friend invited me to stay at his house and watch some Ruggero Deodato films (his subject for the auteur project). How could I refuse? The next morning we went to a bootfair, and armed with a little bit of cash I went around looking for videos to add to my collection. By this time I'd completely forgotten about renting ""The Game"" and I didn't expect to see it being sold at a bootfair. You'd have to be insane to get rid of a film like what I'd seen half of! Thing is, I did! It was a timecode version from a rental store I assume.

The rest of the film was even better than the half I had already seen. As the film progresses, there are so many twists and turns in the plot you almost forget what film you're watching! Michael Douglas is very convincing, and seems as confused as the viewer, as does Sean Penn. I was extremely surprised with Deborah Unger's performance too, having only seen her in David Cronenberg (the auteur I'm studying)'s ""Crash"". Her roles in the two films are so incredibly different I didn't realize it was her at first!<br/><br/>If you want a gripping thriller, go for this one. You won't want to be in the same situation I was and have to stop watching half way through, it's so gripping you'll be on the edge of your seat until the closing credits. Watch it if you're looking for something slightly different to the norm too, as with all Fincher's films. Whatever you're looking for, you won't be disappointed with ""The Game"" unless you're so much of a pedant you have to point out every flaw in the plot (all of which can be justified).<br/><br/>This film will have you paranoid and slightly doubtful about everything you do for quite a while after watching it."

","I don't buy the notion that The Game lacks genuine suspense because we do, all along, know it's all just a game.  There is a natural flow to the film--if you go along with it, of course--that you have to be willing to get dragged into.  <br/><br/>Once you get into that mode then you start to question it - is it just a game?  Wait, it really is a game?  What if it isn't a game? <br/><br/>
I saw this in the theater and totally bought the premise.  I let myself get into ""The Game"" and flow with its dynamics and get carried away with it.  I think there is an underlying experience that one has to permit themselves rather than overanalyzing the content of the film at the time they're watching it.  That may soundly overly simplistic and maybe if this film truly could be carried by its content alone we could approach it from any angle.  Even it were ""perfect"", the nature of a movie like this is that there will always be a certain number of skeptics in the audience who will never let go of what it is versus where it wants to take you.  I suppose if it were ""perfect"" though even the skeptics wouldn't be able to tell if it was real or just a lie.  ""The Usual Suspects"" probably carries this off more believably and resolutely than ""The Game"" does.  Still, as for me, my head was buzzing with the exhilaration after seeing it in the theater and I feel a bit charmed to have been able to experience ""The Game"" exactly as it was intended.<br/><br/>And I don't think the ending was really that bad at all.  ""The Game"" had to end sometime and, well, how should it have ended?"
"dbdumonteil","Null","0","2","6 June 2003"," A game which isn't like the other ones
","Possible Spoilers...<br/><br/>Unlike the acclaimed ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"", ""the Game"" is a movie by David Fincher which tends to be underrated. But I still think that it's as stunning as the two quoted movies. Maybe the beginning of the movie doesn't see any good coming because Fincher used an outline used until one can't take any more: a well-off and strong man (Michael Douglas) who hides a terrible secret. For his birthday, his brother (Sean Penn) offers him a game designed by a mysterious firm and he accepts. From this moment, the movie takes an unexpected shape. Indeed, strange things happen in Douglas' surround. Has the game begun? Is Douglas' life in danger?<br/><br/>The movie is so well made that you believe it's a real thriller. It means that not only is this game a beautiful ""trompe l'oeil"" but it also might be something else like for example a conspiracy against Michael Douglas that aims at making him fall. Moreover, can we really call it a game? There are no rules and Douglas almost died several times. Thankfully, the end  will make him come back down to earth by revealing him the simple truth: it was just a game, nothing else and he won. <br/><br/>As it was the case with his previous movie, Fincher wrote a disturbing and diabolic screenplay in spite of a few unlikelinesses (at the end of the movie, Douglas tries to commit suicide by falling from a very high building). On another hand, his command of the directing isn't necessary to prove and sustain continuously the interest.<br/><br/>After ""Seven"", he persists and scores and if for your next birthday one of your close relatives offers you a similar game to the movie, guess what you'll do..."

","In The Game, Michael Douglas plays a middle-aged, lonely and slightly bored executive. His brother, Sean Penn gives him a token for the ultimate game experience- not just real-time here folks. Beginning with a bizarre clown and ending with a lot of unanswered questions, The Game is certainly a film that you will be talking about for a long time after the slightly suspect conclusion.<br/><br/>David Fincher creates a tension-saturated thriller here. The murky visuals of The Game experience and the heady visuals of the Clockwork Orange-like introduction sequence to Douglas' game are striking. Sean Penn gives an excellent, if slightly too eager performance as the brother and Deborah Unger leaves a significant impression as the shady Christine. The film excels from the moment Douglas enters the game's headquarters until about five minutes from the end.<br/><br/>This is where the film fails. The joy of a film like this is in receiving a fantastic payoff but this conclusion is far from satisfying. The nature of `the game' is more-or-less revealed at the end, which is fine. However when you realise what has happened it more-or-less spoils the film. The beginning of the movie verges on the dull too, where we are treated to lots of brooding shots of Douglas thinking about his long lost father.<br/><br/>
However, ignore the ending and experience the ride there. In this respect, this film is pretty much the best thriller of the 90s."
"Silverzero","Null","0","1","3 May 2003"," Paranoiac, thought-provoking and highly entertaining thriller.
","Always keeping you on the edge of your seat, `The Game' is a brilliantly crafted psychological thriller with a cool scenario. And the promising plot leads to a conclusion that doesn't disappoint. The storyline alone is enough to recommend `The Game' but this is well backed up on most other levels. The script is well timed with plenty of imaginative sequences along with more twists and turns than a helter-skelter. There are also some appropriately dark directing techniques that are frequently used along with cool camera angles. <br/><br/>The acting is very good, even if it is mainly a one-man-show. Michael Douglas was well cast in the lead role and the paranoia and odd occurrences in his normally quiet lifestyles make his transition very convincing. Sean Penn doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but does well in the few scenes that he's in. Deborah Kara Unger is standard is Christine, the woman you can and can't trust. There's some other average support from the likes of James Rebhorn, Armin Mueller Stahl and an actress that appeared to have vanished off the face of the Earth- Carroll Baker. <br/><br/>The film grips like glue and doesn't let go until the `smack-in-the-face' conclusion. It doesn't make a whole lot of logical sense, but then again this is Hollywood we're talking about. Another good thing is the way it is so involving. We feel as though we are plunged into this world of surprises and betrayal that the protagonist is experiencing. <br/><br/>It's an engaging puzzle that has to be worked out, so `The Game' is quite possibly the best psychological `rubix cube' thriller in years. It may heavily border on surrealism at times, but still remains very enjoyable and highly tense. I give it 7.9/10."

Once you think that ""Oh yeah, that's it!"" a new twist will arrive and the viewer is again totally lost, as is the main protagonist. It is horrible to think that something like this happened in real life. The film is often very scary because nobody knows what's going on and the film is pretty dark in lightning, a Fincher trademark. The main point seems to be here that never forget the fact that no matter how rich or wealthy you are, you're still a human being who can die or loose everything like anyone else. Prosperity and power don't make anyone immortal or stronger than others and all the human beings are as vulnerable as others. The film is a lesson in living and remembering the facts of life. <br/><br/>
Extremely pleasant little psycho thriller with fresh script and chilling moments, but actually who would expect Fincher to do something bad or dull?

I know many of will never forgive Fincher after Alien 3, but the movie wasn't as bad as anyone says.  It didn't live up to Aliens, but what could?  Alien and Aliens are two of the best science fiction movies ever, anything else could barely compare.  Also, Alien 3 started shooting without a script.  Any good director knows you have to have a solid script before you start something like this, but Fincher had just entered the movie business from the land of music videos and took whatever job he could get.

","""The Game"" is a true throwback to one of my favorite film sub-genres, the seventies conspiracy film, in all the ways a silly cartoon like ""Conspiracy Theory"" could not be.  Richard Donner directed that juvenile exercise, and, along with the main actors, you know it's just a pretender.<br/><br/>""The Game,"" however, is slow and deliberate, and Fincher lays a network of plotting that Donner couldn't handle on his best day.  The film could easily be criticized for being an expertly crafted thrill-ride, too air-tight to live, but I disagree - as far as I'm concerned, the picture has more life in it than anything that came out in 1997.<br/><br/>Fincher knows this film's roots.  ""The Game"" climbs the ladder of mounting paranoia with classic, unstoppable footsteps.  It is quiet, like ""All the President's Men"" (and shot in a lot of parking garages, like that film). It even features a psych test similar to the one that Warren Beatty takes in ""The Parallax View.""  The ever-mounting dread resembles that found in ""The Conversation"" (along with a distinctive toilet homage to that film).<br/><br/>The only thing different from those great films of the '70s (ones both mentioned and not), is how it all ends.  Missing is the cynical, nihilistic ending, which was the best part of Fincher's ""Seven"" and many of this film's inspirations (stuff like ""The French Connection,"" ""Winter Kills,"" etc.). Fortunately, for buffs of this type of thing, the story has dived about as far into the depths as it could go before things suddenly lift (but not in a contrived way - as a matter of fact, things here are SO contrived, they transcend all that makes the practice so dull!).<br/><br/>Michael Douglas has his best performance (and role) in a long time, and Fincher has proven himself with his third feature, taking a wonderfully inspired screenplay and rising to its level.  The best of its kind since ""JFK,"" and my second favorite film of 1997."

I simply love movies that manage to hold a dark side, without going to overdramatics or being just plain pathetic.<br/><br/>Scores are also important, and the sad tunes found in the movie are very fitting, and if you like the movie, you'll have the sounds of Howard Shore (the mind of the original music in the movie) in your head for days, maybe weeks. Brilliant work by Sean Penn and Micheal Douglas. Watch for some touching moments as well. Enjoy:)"
"nitehawk-8","10","0","1","22 June 1999"," Intense psychological thriller...
","This movie should have been called Paranoia Incorporated... THE GAME was an incredibly intense psychological thriller, one that keeps you guessing at what's real and what's not. Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy investment banker but a miserable human being, receives a gift from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) on his birthday (""for the man who has everything""). The ""game"" that Van Orton becomes involved in consumes every aspect of his life and quickly starts to become nightmarish.<br/><br/>Sparingly advertised or critiqued, this movie was very underrated, and was absolutely the best mystery/thriller I have ever seen. At once you think you know everything that is happening and that is going to happen... but you're in for quite a surprise. The reality of THE GAME changes over and over and you are put in Van Orton's place as you try to figure out what's really going on. I give this movie 9 out of 10. I bought this movie as well, and even though I know what the story is, I still like to imagine what I would do in each situation (plus, if I've invited someone over to watch it for the first time, I love to see their reaction as their predictions are repeatedly dashed to pieces). The ending is nervewracking and insane (in a good way, of course), you will be shocked by it. This is also my favorite movie starring Michael Douglas, he is wonderful in it, and all the other characters are believable and well acted. David Fincher has done well with this movie as a successor to Alien 3 and Se7en, he is the paranoia king!"

","I would say, in all modesty, I am a reasonably intelligent filmgoer and yet I felt so completetly, uh...taken by this movie!  The Game leads you to believe you've got it all figured out (and perhaps you do?) but then whips around 180 degrees and shows the opposite to be true.<br/><br/>If you're prone to finding yourself scared witless by creepy movies at home alone, rent this one with a friend in the daytime.  The Game creates such an acute sense of paranoia it's enough to make anyone scratch their head. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly--until I really sat down and thought about it afterward.  In the final moments, something...well, quite traumatic happens to Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas's skillfully played character.)  Less than a minute later he is expected to be fully jubilant and recovered.  The people who did this to him are supposedly ""good guys"" in the end....and I really can't say any more without revealing the crucial points that make The Game so titulating. But another thing bothered me about the film (okay, besides the plausibility, which the viewer must fully suspend in order to hop aboard The Game.)  If this is just a game, and clients like Nicholas shell out big bucks for the ""entertainment,"" if you can call it such, why was Nick almost killed half a dozen times?  Later it is revealed that the automatic guns were loaded solely with blanks.  Alright, that makes sense, but what about the sinking taxicab scene?  If Nick hadn't reacted quickly as he did and saved himself in a bizarre manner, he would've drowned.  Such a caring company, eh???  The company CRS was only counting on Nicholas to play the game as expected and save himself in situations like this.  True, the personality tests probably gave them a start...but darn it, he still could've drowned!<br/><br/>Alright, now that I worked that out of my system...this is really a fun movie-creepy, mind-boggling, and wholly remarkable--and the rooftop scene had me completely convinced until those doors opened and guess who was really there!  The final scene left me with the question, so what's gonna happen next?  is it truly over?<br/><br/>Then the credits rolled and I realized it was.  I wanted more!"

Michael Douglas was great in this, I really felt what he felt. I could understand his fear. The last scene on top of the building is one of the best I've seen. The darkness and Gothic styles are used to great effect.<br/><br/>Of course, there are minor details that cross the reality line, but hey, it's entertaining nevertheless.

","If you're the type of person who comes to movies just for escapism, this is a good movie to watch.  It's a thrill ride that always keeps you guessing, yet it's enjoyable and keeps you glued.  John Brancato and Michael Ferris were also the credited writers on ""The Net"", and like that underrated film, this asks the question; what if everything you took for granted was thrown out of whack?  Another way to see this is as the ultimate virtual reality movie.  And like any good director, David Fincher turns the screws so subtly that by the time you realize he's done it, you're hooked already.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas, of course, has played so many yuppies he can do them in his sleep, but luckily he didn't here.  He even shows the man behind the facade here.  Sean Penn seems an unlikely choice, but he keeps you guessing.  One performer who gets overlooked usually is Deborah Kara Unger.  Her role may not be that big, but it's certainly key, and the ambiguity she radiates fits perfectly with the tone of the film.  Good character actors like James Rebhorn and Armin Mueller-Stahl also turn in memorable performances.  As for the ending, I can understand how some may have felt cheated, but I loved it."

"Eric-84","Null","0","1","28 December 1998"," Perversely ingenious
","THE GAME is pure pleasure.  Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, an upscale Scrooge placed into the Game, an elaborate series of sudden life experiences of escalating danger and intensity.  The director, David Fincher, has made a movie about a man stripped of the security affluence and power provide.  Yet he's done it by tweaking the protocol of film noir to serve his own cynical ideas about contemporary cultural-claustrophobia; the horror is how completely a ""recreational"" service can usurp a man's life and make it the corporation's plaything.<br/><br/>Fincher knows how silly this premise is, because he's also made a deftly existential, hall-of-mirrors stump-puzzle in which style and conviction count more than credibility.  Are the Game's anonymous strategists trying to con Van Orton?  Harm him? Which life events are games, and which are just life?<br/><br/>The mad-kick answers are far more satisfying than expected, with Fincher crafting the illusory suspense into a leisure-class nightmare of panic and confusion.  Twisting a wealth-fixated Yuppie into a neo-noir hero is a shrewd move-exactly how much space is there between an icy investment banker and a laconic, Mitchumesque loner?  This injection of modernity lends the film a surprising comedic thrust.  We keep laughing that the control-freak is being controlled in ways never dreamed up by himself; the Game is so perversely ingenious and ruthless, even he's impressed.<br/><br/>ERIC BELTMANN"
"khachaba","9","0","1","22 December 1998"," The game certainly started; no one knows how it would end.
","The game, I must say is one of the best movies I have seen that year. It' s another masterpiece by Micheal Douglas. The film has a very high cinematic language. The story is great and treated in the most perfect way by the director of the film. The film appears at first to be a normal action movie, in which the rich Van Orton, chases the bad guys, who by the most original way washed him off all his money. Even this way it could have been a good movie, but a traditional one. Yet the writer had more tricks in his pocket. I don't want to spoil the plot, so I won't mention further details. But I must say that the event sequence cleared up to be most unexpected and most beautiful. The film is different because it turned into having no bad guys at all as appears in the end, this in itself is pure beauty as your mind doesn't contaminate with real violence and blood that fill most (almost all) of the action movies.  If you like Micheal Douglas then this is certainly your movie, for he almost plays solo here; all other characters are (not marginal) but complementary to his role; However, It's his life and his game. The director of the movie is the same director of ""Seven"", another of my favorites. The film has nothing common with ""seven"" except the great cinematic language, the quick paced actions, the unexpected events, especially the end. That end is the most suitable for the film, any other end would have changed the whole idea behind the story; It wouldn't have been ""a game"" any more. Take my advice, watch that film (If you haven't yet), and don't let any one tell you its story before you watch it! I give the film 8/10."

The gift involves Nick signing up for a mysterious company which offers a 'game', which in turn offers participants a series of surprises that 'provides whatever is lacking' in their mundane life. Though a rather pessimistic and somber character Nick accepts in hopes of escaping the machinations of a solitary lifestyle. When the surprises the game offers become seriously deadly Nick wants out. But this particular game doesn't seem to offer any escape.<br/><br/>Critique: Nerve-wracking, high-wire act of a movie directed with guile precision by David Fincher. So far all of Finchers' features have been critically as well as financially good, unusual for someone whose concentrated on subversive material. Michael Douglas is good in the role of another heartless business-type in the 'Gordon Gekko' mold. He gives this character just the slight of hand & vulnerability panic that takes him into 'Twilight Zone' territory. It's also good to see Sean Penn in a less character driven role. <br/><br/>Film is made in such a way that every detail and action has an equal surprising reaction.

","As always, Fincher proves to be a very innovating, intelligent, risk-loving director. There are many very good moments in this movie, and it is, over long periods, simply thrilling. But this makes the end and its flat morality even more annoying. Fortunately, the disturbing power of the previous sequences is strong enough to let you not COMPLETELY ""satisfied"", but the INTENTION to satisfy (and calm) you is obvious.

""The Game"" is an intriguing cinematic experience and Michael Douglas plays his role very well. Sean Penn was also convincing. At it's essence, ""The Game"" is a modern, urban, corporate America version of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but the difference is that there are no kind angels guiding Michael Douglas' character around... at least not in an obvious way. He's ostensibly isolated and possibly on his own, taking us along down a confusing and difficult journey. If you see this movie, and you should, don't do so unless you stick with it through the final 10 minutes, because therein lies the explanation for it all.

","From a spiritual and/or philosophical viewpoint, The Game illustrates many truths, more truths than untruths.  Therefore, it can be classified as a ""teaching movie"", meaning that it illustrates truths which already existed prior to its production.  Or, stated another way, it is fiction with a purpose.<br/><br/>It deals with the breaking down of the human ego in order to locate truth. The main character was not seeking truth, therefore, it was his time or his destiny/fate, spiritually and philosophically speaking.<br/><br/>From a religious/spiritual standpoint, John 9:25 was cited within the movie, ""Whereas once I was blind, now I can see"".  Like the movie ""The Matrix"", the main character is working with what can be considered a spiritual team, headed by what can be considered an Angel of Death.  At the end of the movie Nicholas asks Claire if she is off to sheer some more sheep.  She replies that ""It's just a walk-on this time"", meaning that his (Nicholas') induction into reality was a ""drag-on"" as opposed to a ""walk on"".  His number was up, so to speak.<br/><br/>The main reason that his number was up was due to his intense fear regarding his father's suicide at age 48, which is the age Nicholas finds himself at in the beginning of the movie and the fact that he might be destined to follow in his father's footsteps, or cursed in that respect, if one believes in curses.  Nicholas' other fears were addressed also.  Regarding fear itself, there is a passage in the Christian Bible by one of the prophets which states, ""What I have feared the most has come upon me"". Metaphysically, fear begets fear or like attracts like.  Another good reason to confront fears and walk through them before they walk through us.<br/><br/>Nicholas died at least once in the movie (woke up in a grave in Mexico and received a T-shirt stating that fact, later, from his brother).<br/><br/>There are several consciousness dimensional shifts illustrated in the movie, the first being as Michael Douglas as Nicholas entered the airport to travel to Armin Mueller-Stahl's character's location to fire him.<br/><br/>The movie depicts Nicholas' humbling process in an excellent manner, focusing on his manipulation and control tendencies and his self-centered advanced state of egocentricity as well as his fears.<br/><br/>The movie additionally depicts and confirms immortality of the human spirit as well as alternate realities, worlds, universes, existences."

The acting is also quite good.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie though, is that you should just go and see it. I knew a tad bit to much, so I couldn't quite let it go. I anticipated the ending (but didn't completely figure it out). To really enjoy this movie, you have to try to get Nicholas' (Michael Douglas) point of view. That's all you'll get out of me.<br/><br/>By the way, watch out for blue colors. It's typical for David Fincher movies. All in all I give this one 8/10.

","Warning: Spoilers Supreme ahead; if you haven't seen the end of the movie skip this summary completely.<br/><br/>I agree with the people below who say the ending is ridiculously implausible; that the people controlling this, would instead of just ending the game when he thinks he has killed his brother, they go one step further, and lead him to fall hundreds of feet, onto an airbag. There are so many ways he could have died, can you just see someone saying ""hmmm, maybe we should just have ended it on the roof, I forgot to take that slight wind into account. Oh well.""<br/><br/>What are the odds that of all the places on the roof he could have taken the plunge from, he picks the only spot within two feet either way where he would hit that bag.<br/><br/>And how about the impact on his body of hitting that glass from hundreds of feet up, accelerating every 32 feet. Good thing he hit both the glass and the airbag on his back.<br/><br/>However, I also read in a couple of places that originally he did die and just went splat below; but that test audiences found it too grim an ending, so they changed it.<br/><br/>But I didn't feel cheated, because it just added to the final twist. Even when the girl is pleading with him that his brother is behind the door with a bottle of champagne, you don't really believe her. Besides there are so many things that seemed implausible, from him getting out of that sinking cab, to the seemingly real bullets strafing walls everywhere he runs. And how about that attack dog gnawing at him on the ladder? Was he an actor who knew when to stop biting?<br/><br/>Anyways, you have to suspend some cynicism and just see it as a spectacular prank a man plays on his brother in a last-ditch effort to get him to turn his life around."

"ktappe","Null","0","1","7 September 2001"," A Recommended Emotional Thriller
","One of the best signs of a great film is that it brings out your emotions. This means it's making you think about and react to its characters. The Game does<br/><br/>this in spades. As all of these events unfold, dragging Nick with them, you keep wanting to give him suggestions and you certainly ask yourself repeatedly what you'd do in his place. Is it plausible? After a second viewing, I'd say that 95% of it would indeed be possible to pull-off, given the kinds of funds they made it clear were available to be spent.  It would take serious thought and planning to cover all the angles, but it could be done.<br/><br/>::MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD:: Should the plot have gone other directions, such as having Nick be the only one who believed he was playing a game? Certainly not--films that have a single<br/><br/>protagonist following the truth with the rest of the world disbelieving are so common, they're beyond cliche. This film deftly avoided falling into that trap by having the ""police"" concede that there was evidence to support Nick's story (the graffiti, the ambulances, etc.) It also wisely kept one character (his lawyer) completely out of the loop, adding to the credibility of the plot.<br/><br/>::SEVERE SPOILERS AHEAD:: There's a serious plot hole in that they couldn't have predicted what side of the roof Nick would jump from. Nor could they have known he'd hit the airbag<br/><br/>back-first (hitting it head-down from that height could easily have been fatal.) In fact, having him hit the ""X"" instead of being a bit off-center really ruined the scene. And the plot doesn't deal at all with the natural anger Nick should have felt at being not only duped but made to think he'd killed his own brother (very uncool.) Instead he smiles and shakes hands with people who have put him through<br/><br/>such living hell he willingly chose to die. The ending absolutely begs for this to be addressed but it is not.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, any film that causes such thought-provoking discussion must<br/><br/>receive recommendation, even if it doesn't warrant a vote of ""10""."

This is an absolutely brilliant film the writing of it is excellent, despite its far fetched idea and happenings (none of the events of the film could ever really happen the way it did in the film). The direction is also first rate and the atmosphere that is created is so tense and really creates a sense of paranoia, i unfortunately missed the first ten or so minutes but the Game as such had not really got started so i lucked out, i can't really explain why i found this film so intrigueing, its an edge of the seat affair that is brilliantly acted and strange because after the film i was trying to think what just went on and you want to see it again much like Finchers other film Fight club which is also excellent, but i do prefer this. I don't know quite why i was never bothered about watching this especailly considering how excellent it was and i must say to watch it at the cinema in the dark would be excellent i hope the do have a special re-showing of this like they do with some films.

","I really enjoyed this movie. It looks magnificent, the script is witty and believable, and the plot will truly keep you guessing until the very last minute.<br/><br/>I find that this is one of the few films that's still enjoyable after many viewings. I think that's partly down to Michael Douglas' convincing portrayal of the snake-like billionaire anti-hero - he's had similar roles in movies such as 'Wall Street' and 'A Perfect Murder', but this is a character with much greater depth. He gets some great lines - one of my personal favourites occurs after he's lost a shoe running from the attack dogs :<br/><br/>    = There goes a thousand dollars !<br/><br/>    = Your shoes cost a thousand dollars ?<br/><br/>    = That one did.<br/><br/>I'll admit that the plot occasionally stretches credibility, particularly in the last few minutes - the entire story centres around accepting that CRS is able to predict how Michael Douglas' character is going to react to the situation he's placed in. If you can't accept this idea, I don't think you'll have much fun with the movie.  <br/><br/>*MAJOR* SPOILER ALERT :<br/><br/>Many people have criticised the ending - how could they know exactly where he'd jump from ? In defence, I've got two theories :<br/><br/>= First, we never see the layout of the entire rooftop - it's possible there's only place where it would be possible to climb over the edge of the roof (perhaps other directions are walled off, etc). Once Van Orton decides to jump, he has little choice about where to jump from.<br/><br/>= In the post-jump party, the TV actor he kidnapped at the zoo tells Van Orton, 'Thank God you jumped - if you didn't, I had to throw you off !'. You're not asked to believe that CRS *knew* he would jump - but their psychological profiling told them it was likely he *might*.<br/><br/>Flimsy, I know, but I think it's unfair to dismiss the whole movie as completely ludicrous based on the final few minutes.<br/><br/>Great movie overall, it gets 9/10 from me."

"Eli-57","5","0","3","2 January 2001"," good thriller, but flawed...SPOILERS galore in this review
","""The Game"" is a dark, tense, suspenseful thriller by David Fincher, the excellent director of ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en.""  ""The Game"" doesn't live up to either of those movies (which are some of the best to come out of Hollywood in the last decade).  Michael Douglas gives a decent performance as Nicholas Van Orton, a fantastically rich investment banker.  Sean Penn also does well as his younger brother Conrad.<br/><br/>Except for the last seven or eight minutes, the movie is gripping, exciting, and unpredictable.  In short, everything you want in a thriller.  But those few minutes change things considerably.  --(this is where the spoilers come in)--  We learn that The Game was just an elaborate way to make Van Orton have a good time and rejuvenate his life.  He is certainly grateful, kind, and appreciative to his brother for the gift, so we can assume that the experience really did change his life.  However, we don't see a lot of other evidence to back this up.  He does accept responsibility for his divorce, and he basically gets less uptight, more relaxed, and more able to enjoy his life.<br/><br/>My reaction to that was something like, ""They went to all that trouble and took up 2 hours of my life so some jerk with a $600 million bank account can relax more""?  This neutralizes a great deal of the movie's appeal as a thriller.  Van Orton never really uncovers the secret for himself, they brought it to him.  In fact, he was being manipulated throughout the course of the entire movie.  There are a few loose ends that aren't resolved well: the snapshots in his hotel room, the graffiti in his house.  The explanation for these turns out to be, essentially, that CRS was just jerking him around to make him scared.<br/><br/>""The Game's"" ending is something of a cop-out.  Rather than a top-notch surprise ending that really ties everything together (like in ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""The Sixth Sense""), ""The Game"" has a sort of blanket explanation for everything weird that happened.<br/><br/>The ending is, at first, mind-blowing.  But then you realize that all the great suspense and action added up to...well, nothing.  For the two hours before you figure everything out, ""The Game"" is a superb thriller.  After that, it loses its impact and becomes a disappointment.<br/><br/>Fincher still does an excellent job on the atmosphere of the movie, very dark and stylized.  ""The Game"" is worth a look-see if you're a fan of Fincher or mysteries in general, but otherwise isn't such hot stuff."
"Afracious","10","0","2","15 December 2000"," A superb, tortuous and suspenseful thriller
","The Game is a tortuous and superb suspenseful thriller by David Fincher. The film leads the viewer down many uncertain paths, has we follow the nightmare world in which Michael Douglas' character is thrown into. Douglas is good as Nicholas Van Orton, a very wealthy businessman who has everything, except true happiness and excitement in his life. He lives alone in a large mansion, and is tended to by his trusty long-serving female maid. We soon learn his father committed suicide by jumping from the top of the mansion. Van Orton occasionally has flashbacks of the tragedy.<br/><br/>On his 48th birthday Nicholas is paid a visit by his younger brother Conrad, played by Sean Penn. Over dinner, Conrad gives Nicholas a gift, an invitation to visit Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) to enrol for The Game, an ambiguous life-altering event that Conrad says has changed his life. He tells Nicholas that it will make his life fun. Nicholas visits CRS and is greeted by James Rebhorn. He fills in a long application form, which asks him many obscure questions. He then has to endure more examining, a medical, and sitting through some bizarre images shown on a film.<br/><br/>
The next day Nicholas receives a phone call to inform him he has failed the test for The Game; but unknowingly to him, The Game will now begin. Things immediately start to go wrong for him. His pen leaks ink on his shirt, and his briefcase won't open. While at a restaurant, he has wine spilled on him by a waitress named Christine (sexy Deborah Kara Unger) she is then fired by her boss, and Nicholas receives a note to follow her. While with her, he finds himself locked in a lift, has to run from a police dog, and has to jump from a fire escape into a garbage skip.<br/><br/>This is just the start of The Game for Nicholas. He will later find himself with incriminating photos and cocaine in his hotel room. He will find himself trapped in a taxi that is sinking. He will wake up in a flimsy wooden coffin in Mexico, with no money and identification on him. A man who was once powerful is now transformed into an emotional wreck. Eventually, he has to find the man who interviewed him for The Game, James Rebhorn. He enters CRS with a loaded pistol, and takes Christine hostage. The conclusion is slightly incredulous, but fittingly appropriate. The Game is a ride you'll want to take again."
"Minofed","Null","0","1","22 November 2000"," The Experience Economy
","THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY<br/><br/>In 1999 Joseph Pine and James Gilmore wrote a book, `The Experience Economy.'  Their premise was that for businesses to survive they must stage experiences.  By way of example they cited the mythical Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) featured in `The Game.'   `The Game' stars Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, who is such a cold-blooded capitalist he makes Gordon Gekko (Douglas' Academy-Award winning role in `Wall Street') look like a philanthropist.  Van Orton's life consists of watching financial news on the television in his mansion, firing unproductive managers-and obsessing on his father, who committed suicide at age 48.  He can barely remember his ex-wife's name.  <br/><br/>The movie begins on Van Orton's birthday-his 48th.  His ne'er-do-well brother (Sean Penn) gives him as a present `The Game,' and the adventure is on.  Before the movie is over Nicholas will be shot at, drugged, impoverished-and that's just the fun part.  And even though the movie has been called mean-spirited, in the end he will find a type of redemption and a new direction. <br/><br/>The beauty of `The Game' is in its unpredictability. You never know where the movie is headed.  In fact, you're not even sure how the movie ends.  As usual, director David Fincher fills each frame with detail and color.  He makes even a stock shot of an airplane landing fascinating.<br/><br/>Don't look for a lot of logic here.  Roger Ebert talks about the impossibility of Chuck Norris' character crashing a motorcycle into a house at the exact spot he needs to in `Delta Force.'  CRS has to do something similar dozens of times in this film, and always is on the mark.  And we'd love to know how much Penn would have paid for his brother's experience. The movie teases us with this at the end.<br/><br/>Douglas and Penn have some of their best roles here, and Deborah Kara Unger is fine as a waitress (or is she?) who becomes involved in Douglas' game. But it is character actor James Rebhorn who steals the film as Douglas' operative-or is he?"

","I saw David Fincher's The Game last night on TNT and have to say it was for the most part a pretty satisfying experience, although as others have noted, the ending, which I won't give away, does not exactly fit the preceding two hours or so, because it has a bit of a cop-out, wrong-note, life-affirming sort of feel to it.  Michael Douglas, who has emerged as perhaps Hollywood's best lead actor in the middle-years range, gives one of his most impressive performances.  He plays a wealthy San Francisco investment banker here, but while this guy may be as corporate-greedy as Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's socially concerned Wall Street (1987), Nick Van Orton is a character you can sympathize with as his wayward younger brother, played by Sean Penn, tempts him to re-awaken a side of himself that his life as a powerful capitalist has apparently deadened.  The thing that is supposed to change his life is The Game, an experience custom-tailored to participants by a nebulous corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).  Van Orton's curiosity impels him to submit to CRS's psychological and physical testing without even knowing what the exact nature of The Game---its rules, its object---actually is. In a scene alluding to Kubrick's 1971 version of Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange, Van Orton is stuck in a dark projection room being fed an endless series of unrelated images interlaced on the screen with suggestive words. Before he knows it, Van Orton is plunged into a non-stop sequence of experiences, more life-threatening than life-enhancing as his brother had promised, precipitated by the pretty good Deborah Unger as Christine, a waitress at a swanky restaurant.  As Van Orton is confronted by a series of weird events, such as finding a life-sized clown doll lying on its stomach on the drive outside his mansion, an image deliberately designed to evoke for him the childhood memory of seeing his father commit suicide by throwing himself off their roof, he begins to question whether CRS is really in the private entertainment industry or has he been set up.  Is CRS some kind of scam designed to bilk him of his fortune?  Can he trust Christine, who is thrown into the non-stop action along with him?  Is his brother in on it, too?  Fincher's breathless direction keeps you riveted to your seat waiting to find out how this will all be wrapped up.  Proof that this picture is so engrossing for a wide array of tastes is that I saw it at my mom's and she ended up enjoying it as much as I did, even though I took her to see last year's Fight Club, also by Fincher, and she ended up walking out of the theater by the end of the first half hour of that picture, saying, ""I'll wait for you outside.  This is disgusting.""  Well, I loved 1999's Fight Club, which was much better than the ridiculously overrated American Beauty, and for me, after having seen The Game, I think Fincher is in the top handful of the best Hollywood directors to come out of the last decade.  While The Game is not as darkly subversive as Fight Club, it explores some of the same themes and concerns, such as the emotional emptiness and social disconnectedness engendered by the single-minded pursuit of wealth and the need to find something drastically outside the ""mainstream"" in order to get back in touch with the primordial self, as well as the paranoia unleashed by the rapid pace of computer technological change.  For people who say that the somewhat sappy wrap-up at the end makes them feel ""cheated,"" they ought to consider that this movie makes you think while at the same time taking you for a rip-rollicking, good suspenseful-thriller ride.  Not too many movies come along all that often that can do that."

Douglas was some what typical Douglas-style but well suited for the role.<br/><br/>But it's not the acting that everyone remembers about this movie, as I mentioned bove, plot twists, like never before, are the jewel of this picture. After watching this movie, you'll probably start seeing ""CRS"" everywhere. If you don't get that, watch the movie!"
"alecwest","Null","0","1","28 February 2004"," An exciting exercise in impossibility.
","From the beginning of this film to about the last few minutes, I'd have rated it 10 out of 10 on the action level.  But overall, the last few minutes of the film dropped that rating to zero.  I don't care how many psychological profile tests a person takes, human beings are by and large unpredictable.  And, along with that unpredictability is the absolute unpredictability of human beings NOT INVOLVED in 'the game' ... persons whose intervention in the process could have greatly affected the outcome. The plot, overall, was an exercise in impossibility ... a 'game' that, due to the variables, could have had detrimental if not fatal effects on anyone involved (or even people not involved).  That, in turn, made the 'game' a highly irresponsible endeavor.  If I were Douglas' character, I'd not have felt relieved when the game was finally exposed as just a game.  I'd have felt angry and insulted ... and would have distanced myself even further from friends and relatives involved in the process.  Far from being a 'gift', I'd have seen it as disrespectful and as an affront.<br/><br/>This movie's theme was an elaborate practical joke played on one character. But, the real practical joke was played on the people who watched it.  I can't speak for others but, in my case, I was not amused."

","What a fantastic movie, inspired even. It doesn't seem that interesting at first glance and the set-up is a little slow but after that, when Douglas's character goes to CRS to start his 'game' the film immediately hits top gear and is brilliant right up until the end. The genius behind it is that, unlike some other psychological thrillers like Perfect Blue et al, you know what's going on and what the current state of play is but you have no idea how it's going to end or whether CRS really are out to kill him. The pacing from Conrad's invitation on is perfect and to see the way Michael Douglas's in-control businessman is turned inside our by what he sees as 'depraved children' is very engrossing. It's difficult to put into words just how great this film is without getting my words into a tizz or giving away the plot. Needless to say everything about it is fantastic from the acting to the beautiful script to the hugely atmospheric photography. Brilliant, get it out, love it, buy a copy, love it some more."

","Personally, I loved this movie.  From beginning to end, it is a wholly engrossing film, one that is extremely under-rated, in my opinion.<br/><br/>It is the story of a wealthy financial player who is very arrogant, egotistical, and withdrawn at the same time.  As his birthday present, his brother buys him a gift certificate from a company called Consumer Recreation Services.  This company provides an experience to the customer, ""the game"", which is different for everybody, and very mysterious.  The film is a non-stop action ride through 2 hours of plot twists, backstabbing, and surprises.  Once the game begins, Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) must see it through to its shocking conclusion.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas is excellent as the ice-cold Van Orton, and Sean Penn does a superb job playing his brother, Conrad.  Deborah Unger, who also appears in director David Cronenberg's ""Crash"", also plays her part very convincingly. In all, this movie shouldn't be missed, and should be viewed with an open mind.<br/><br/>My Rating:  10/10"

","Van Orton was Scrooged in this great movie. The cinematography was excellent in the flashback footage of the protagonist.  The audience is taken on a suspension ride of disbelief (like Magritte's pipe).<br/><br/>Van Orton was the dynamic character in this movie because he went through a sort of catharsis.  The sequence of events were definetly contrived and could cast doubts on it's realism. However, the ending is a must.  (One member commented that it was just some deux es machina.)<br/><br/>BUT--it isn't because just like The Fight Club, Sixth Sense, the usual suspect and other movies before/after it, the entire movie hinges on an unexpected ending.  That's what makes this  a classic in my book (in lue of the run of the mill Christmas Story or Miracle on Corny Street)."

"Brian-272","10","0","2","16 April 2000"," Mind Boggling! A Must See.
","The Game is the best thriller ever! I just want to mention that Michael Douglas has really hit the mark as an actor. Michael Douglas is one of Hollywood's best actors an all time great, his role in the Game his best ever performance puts him in a class of his own. The Game can best be described as a puzzler about a control freak billionaire (Michael Douglas) caught in a deadly swirl of cat and mouse when his younger disreputable brother (Sean Penn) gives him a gift certificate to participate in a mysterious game that invades his ordered existence. Douglas's role of Nicholas Van Orton has to win the deadly game or lose control of life. After Van Orton battles the mystery and ultimate terror challenge of ""The Game"", surprise all just a birthday gift. The object of any game is fear and surprise. The Game is a must see due to Michael Douglas's no nonsense acting and the thrilling mystery that boggles your mind, only to harmlessly surprise in the end. A must see, Michael Douglas at his best."

","I finally got around to seeing this amazing film last night.  The Game stars Michael Douglas as very uptight businessman who receives a unique birthday present from his brother, played by Sean Pean.  The present is kind of an enrolment into a ""game,"" sponsored by a very large, mysterious company called Consumer Recreation Services.  Douglas has no idea what he is getting himself into.  The utter treachery of this ""game"" is completely unanticipated; Douglas' bank accounts are drained and his life is threatened, which are only two of the many things that go wrong in his life. Throughout the film, I asked myself one question: Is CRS completely responsible for Douglas' bad luck, or is he only paranoid? Douglas is perfect for playing the part of a man desperately clinging to sanity in a world turned upsidedown.  The film is great as it is before the final development (which is very unexpected), after which it is amazing.  The Game is now one of my favorite films.  Watching The Game, I was reminded of The Truman Show.  In both films, one man fights to preserve his humanity in a world that oppresses freedom and truth."
"Fredichi","10","0","2","4 April 2000"," Great thriller
","Alright this seems to be a hit or miss with a lot of people. Most people who dislike it credit that to it being unbelievable or predictable. Or that they felt nothing for Michael Douglas.<br/><br/>I disagree with these comments, probably because I fell for everything. I fell for everything cause I wanted to. It earned my respect from the opening scenes. <br/><br/>It just hit the mark with me from frame one. The footage of Nicholas as a boy with his father with that absolutely haunting music was a brilliant opener.<br/><br/>That music explains everything. The music and this little prologue add more depth to the movie than some movies have in their entire length.<br/><br/>Nobody but Michael Douglas could of pulled this off. He is perfectly cast as Nicholas. He brings so much subtlety to his role. Watch when he is driving in his car talking on his car phone. Watch how he figits and holds the wheel. It fits so perfectly with who is supposed to be.<br/><br/>
The build up to the actual game is perfect. Nothing is too abrupt. But once it starts it snowballs into a train ride through hell and doesn't let up until it's fantastic and well suited ending. The plausibility of the logistics of the ending require the viewer to stretch but if you had come along the rest of the way this leap isn't hard to make.<br/><br/>A great movie. One of my favorites. The epitome and definition of a thriller. Suspense, dark tone, mystery. Solid slick movie. David Fincher doesn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Once again great score. Particularly the piano theme in the beginning. Absolutely haunting. The only other movie that used this type of emotionally charged beginning (where the tone is set up in mere seconds) I feel is Jacob's Ladder. Go see that too."
"rejoefrankel","10","0","1","16 February 2000"," The Game definitely worth playing.
","A fascinating, original absolutely pitch perfect thriller that is mysterious, suspenseful and rich in character.  Michael Douglas stars as a successful business man celebrating his birthday.  As a gift for ""the man who has everything,"" his brother (Sean Penn) gives him a ticket to a corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).  Reluctantly Douglas follows his curiousity to CRS and after filling out a lengthy questionaire, undergoing a rigurous medical examination and disclosing personal information about himself, he is told that his game will begin soon.  Almost immediately afterwards strange things start happening.  Things that seem so real that Douglas begins to question if people are actually trying to set him up, or if it is all just a game.  His life is threatened multiple times, he meets a beautiful, mysterious woman with whom he becomes involved and the plot takes a series of roller coaster dives until it reaches it's shocking conclusion.  Many people were unsatisfied with the ending of the film, possibly because there is no clear expectation generated by the midsection. But I feel that it is suitable and just.  The Game is a thriller that thrills, and it doesn't sell out for cheap violence, sex, or explosions (although it has a little of all these things).  It is a masterful film that demands multiple viewings, tautly directed and cleverly scripted.  One of the best thrillers of the 90's!"

Don't get me wrong, this is an above average film, it just could have been so much better. David Fincher fans go and have a blast, but be warned, it isn't a patch on Fight Club or Se7en.  But it is good fun; it just tries to be too smart in the one twist too far finale.  It'll keep you guessing though."

","There is not much to be said about this strange and exciting picture. Although not a very original picture, the acting, together with good characterization and directing, makes The Game one of the most exciting moments in Cinema these days. Good plot, good twists and turns, a false finale, followed by sweet finale. Douglas is great (his usual self), Unger is average, Sean Penn is good, and the rest of the cast helps the story move along. ItÂ´s a form of thriller that touches the fringes of fantastic tales (such as the ones by Stephen King and Dean Koontz). A good movie, full of surprises, you get hooked to the characters and wait impatiently for the finale."

","Very few films have the power to manipulate the audience till the end as ""The Game"". It is one of the most inventive, unusual, weird and unpredictable films of the '90s. I just can't understand why it wasn't nominated as best original screenplay on the Oscar, because you don't see films like this one every day.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, there was a millionaire named Nicholas Van Orton. He had everything he wanted, except the company of people- friends, girlfriends, etc. On his 48th birthday, he met his brother in a restaurant and he was given a small gift- a free pass for the CRS. But what was the CRS- The Consumer Recreation Service? Well... He had never heard about it, so he decided to use his pass. After doing many exams in the CRS, some strange things started to happen. Everything started with a wooden clown in his garden, which had a key into its mouth. Then his television started to 'talk' to him. And after that he met a waitress named Christine in the most unusual situations. From this moment on, his life was never the same...<br/><br/>You can't, you just can't find out what comes next in ""The Game"". It kept my attention each second. While it is coming to the end, we think that we know everything, but we don't. The ending was just... Wow! Amazing! I could have never found out that. It was a huge twist, as I just saw in ""The Sixth Sense"". Some people may not be convinced by the final twist, but I didn't mind. After the film ended, I was just blown away. I couldn't think about another thing. It is not THE perfect movie, because there are some scenes that could have been deleted. But I gave it a 9 and I can't give it less than that. Even Michael Douglas surprised me with a very solid acting. And Deborah Kara Unger is just amazing in a great performance.<br/><br/>As I've already said, I don't know why ""The Game"" was not nominated in any category on the Oscar. It really impressed me.

","Well what can I say about The Game? Watching it is just bizarre - Fincher takes us on an insane journey, twisting our perceptions of what is going on every few minutes. The amount of conclusions I jumped to and then abandoned, only to later return to is astounding.The ending, which in retrospect should have made me feel cheated (but somehow doesn't), is awesome. An almost flawless film, and I defy anyone to figure out what is *really* happening before the last 5 minutes. This film is twisted on a level I never even thought possible! A brilliant, brilliant job by Fincher. Even Douglas (who I dislike as an actor) performed well, and aside from the odd plot hole (which is to be expected wit ha plot as interlaced as this) I cannot fault it. Wow."

","Do you enjoy movies that keep you guessing until the very end? A movie that each time you view it, you get more insight and discover new things? This is that movie and in my opinion is very under-rated. This is an intelligent psychological thriller and an excellent film disguised as a cookie-cutter Hollywood no-brainer. It has big stars and a big budget but is in no way conventional. If you've seen Seven or Fight Club you know what I'm talking about. The filmmakers obviously know how complicated their plot gets and take their time. The pace of this movie is the greatest part, slowly unveiling itself and taking us along with main character deeper and deeper without losing us. This was reminiscent of The Spanish Prisoner, another under-rated film that kept you guessing until the end. Great story and keep your eyes on David Fincher"

","""The Game"" is an engrossing, white knuckler of a movie--the best kind of intense suspense plots.  There are shades of ""Three Days of the Condor"" (another favorite) in it.  I changed my mind on what was actually going on about 3 times.  It's rare that a movie can be that successful in hiding the true plot from the audience.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas and Deborah Unger were perfectly cast.  They played parts in a real-life computer adventure game.  Just like in an adventure game, the main character receives or picks up items along his journey--never knowing if, when or how he may need them.
