"undersky","8","865","897","27 December 2010"," A movie with a gentle but long-lasting impression.
","The Sixth Sense enjoys being playful with our imagination. What your eyes see is not exactly what it is. What your mind paints is not exactly what there is. In the world of The Sixth Sense logic is your worst enemy.<br/><br/>There are obvious (and sometimes less obvious) hints right in front of you but you don't grasp them because of your preconceptions and premises. I once read a novel called 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' which used similar techniques found in this movie, but in writing. I'm sure you will enjoy this book as much as I did, if you like to be intellectually surprised.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, don't read reviews and don't talk to your friends who have already seen it. The movie is very much susceptible to spoilers. It is suffice to say that the ending is just shockingly delightful.<br/><br/>I don't consider this movie heavily philosophical or thought-provoking. Having said that, it is one of the movies I love to watch again and again."
"kylopod","10","283","306","31 December 2005"," An appropriate spoiler-free review
","The surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has gotten so much attention that it threatens to overshadow the film. I occasionally hear people say things like the following: ""The 'twist' was so obvious that I figured it out in the first five minutes!"" Some of those people may even be telling the truth. There's no way to know. But there's a lot of condescension in such remarks, an implication that anyone who didn't figure it out must be a really dumb sucker. At least in my case I have an excuse. When I first saw this film back in early 2000, I knew nothing about it other than that it was about the relationship between a psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis and a child with some sort of psychic power. I didn't even know what that psychic power was, and an early scene led me to think it was telepathy. In short, I had no idea even what the movie's subject was until about the middle of the film, so I was completely adrift as to solving the movie's mystery.<br/><br/>Still, to anyone who did figure the secret out quickly, I have this to say: you may be smarter than I am, but that does not make this a bad movie. Hitchcock went to great lengths to keep the ending to ""Psycho"" from leaking out. Many people who watch that film today figure the twist out (probably because it has been imitated in countless thrillers since then), but the film is still a classic that holds up well today. Surprise endings are, ultimately, just clever contrivances, extra layerings on the cake. They do not constitute the difference between a good movie and a bad movie. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there can be no denying that the twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" is particularly clever. It's no virtue if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist be logical as that it be surprising. Plenty of thrillers feature twists that are arbitrary, where the plot fails to provide enough hints. Even a clever thriller like ""Fight Club"" requires a bit of a stretch to accept the ending. What makes ""The Sixth Sense"" impressive is that it never cheats by suggesting that earlier scenes were imaginary. Everything we see is real, and only our assumptions fool us. If, however, you weren't fooled, all the better: just because you figure out the magician's trick does not make it a bad trick.<br/><br/>Consider what appears to be happening in the film. Willis plays a psychiatrist who has received accolades for helping children with problems. We see a romantic evening with him and his wife at home. Then he gets into an ugly, violent confrontation with a former patient. Willis believes he has failed, and he wants to make amends by helping a new child (Haley Joel Osment) who appears to be having the same problems (and perhaps the same abilities) that his former patient once displayed. But just as he thinks he's making progress with Osment, his marriage seems to be falling apart. His wife isn't talking to him, and is beginning to see another man.<br/><br/>However these events may be reinterpreted by what is revealed later, the movie is effective because it works on this basic level. In a key scene, Willis asks Osment what he wants most, and Osment answers, ""I don't want to be scared anymore."" It is not always clear that Osment is really facing a mortal threat. But because the movie establishes that he is undergoing a scary experience, by the time the movie reveals what it is that is frightening him, we have our emotions invested in the character, and the terror is very real to us. This is a step that most horror films neglect, the recognition that the most powerful fear may be the fear of fear itself.<br/><br/>When I was a teenager, I assumed that all good horror films had to have an R rating. Even as an adult, I was surprised that a movie as frightening as ""The Sixth Sense"" received only a PG-13. In hindsight, however, most of my favorite horror films, whatever their rating, have relatively little violence. Like all good horror films, ""The Sixth Sense"" allows the suspense to build and does not rely on either excessive violence or cheap scares. The ending adds an additional level of intrigue, but it is not necessary to one's enjoyment during the first viewing. Still, if you have not seen the film by now and remain woefully ignorant of the surprise lurking in its plot, I urge you, before someone ruins it for you, go and watch the movie!"
"jayp-5","Null","399","441","4 December 1999"," A movie that will not be outclassed in its genre for years to come
","When I first saw The Sixth Sense, I didn't know what to expect. I guess I was looking forward to a good scary horror flick.  I was very surprised. I found that the purpose for this movie was far greater than just trying to scare the audience.  I found this movie was showing not only the emotions of fear, but also faith, commitment, sadness of loss, and love.  The end was so surprising, I had to see it again.  The second time I watched it, I did it from a totally different perspective (this is a very rare quality for any movie), and I enjoyed it just as much, or maybe even more. I also, as many viewers have, tried to detect fallacies in the story.  I couldn't find one. In addition, for those that appreciate great soundtracks, the music only helps to heighten the experience of the movie.<br/><br/>
I believe that a great movie is one that helps the viewer perceive life and the world differently.  The Sixth Sense is one of those extraordinary movies that does that to me.  This movie reflects on some difficult subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking eternal questions.  Questions about death, about letting go, about eternal love and commitment, about the love between parent and child, and between husband and wife.  Maybe I read too much into this very wonderful film, but I believe it will be difficult to find a movie that has touched on these subjects so poignantly and so well for years to come."
"Steve Steckel","Null","226","253","25 October 2000"," The most careful attention to detail
","What makes this film so wonderful to watch is not simply the acting, or the terror it instills, or even the plot itself.  It is the way in which the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan takes his vision from the page, and carefully crafts a tale that completely absorbs the viewer.  As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion: fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character's soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.  But at least they'll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way."
"Xophianic","9","30","31","3 February 2000"," One of the best films of 1999!
","I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn't seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.<br/><br/>THE SIXTH SENSE is about an award-winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is depressed because one of his former clients committed suicide because Crowe was unable to help him. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is a child that has social problems frighteningly similar to Crowe's old client, so Crowe decides he will try to help this child in order to find redemption. Cole later reveals that this problem goes well beyond normal social problems. He claims to be able to see the ghosts of dead people, but no one else can.<br/><br/>The acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis' depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment's loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I've ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.<br/><br/>The plot is very entertaining, though at times you may wonder where it is going. The ending is the best part of the movie, and it completely changes whatever you originally thought of the whole story line. I applaud the advertisers of THE SIXTH SENSE for not leaving a trace of the surprise ending in the previews of the movie (unlike DOUBLE JEOPARDY) and I certainly will not give it away in this comment. But I will say that it will completely surprise most all of you. (I think many that say that they saw it coming are probably lying.)<br/><br/>THE SIXTH SENSE is one of my favorite movies, and I think it is surely one of the best films of 1999. I hope it wins many Oscars this year, and I recommend that you go out and buy this movie now."

","The Sixth Sense is one of those films that rarely happens these days.  In other words, I knew so little about it before sitting in the cinema that it wasn't ruined before it started.<br/><br/>I don't want to ramble on about it so I'll just say... absolute perfection. An incredible story that had me and my friends gripped from start to finish. The twist in the tale was totally unexpected as well.<br/><br/>After it finished we sat through the whole of the credits and talked about how fabulous it was.  If only more films were like this.

","This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his career as the child psychologist trying to get himself back on track after a violent encounter with a former patient and it would be a crime if Haley Joel Osment were overlooked at coming awards ceremonies for his powerful performance here. It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.<br/><br/>You don't need to go and see this film again to realise why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.<br/><br/>Laugh, cry, jump a mile out of your seat, sigh with relief - but not too early...

","The Sixth Sense is a brilliant film, plain and simple. It is unique in that it relies on imagination and psychology to scare you and make you think twice about the world around you. The director did a fabulous job constructing the imagery of the film, and I genuinely did not know about the ending until it was revealed. Quite a shock! The Sixth Sense goes in my book as the single greatest psychological horror film I have ever seen. Anyone who bashes it are simply not giving it a chance or don't fully realize the complex dialog and imagery around them. Brilliant"
"NpMoviez","10","14","14","15 August 2019"," The reason why everyone loved Shyamalan back then!!
","Shyamalan at his very best! I said it, I don't care what people think. Many people claim Unbreakable to be his best film till date, but for me, as much as I love Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense will always remain as the best Shyamalan had to offer.<br/><br/>Good : It's his masterpiece. Shyamalan has never been better. What does it not have? Emotions, drama, character development, storytelling, great writing + directing, all of it. Willis does a really good job. It is perhaps the first time I saw him in a role like this, one of the best examples of casting against type. The arc of the child played by Osment and that of Willis have been given full justice. Seeing them help each other overcome their problems and fears in the way they did was very good. There are some emotional moments which hit the right notes, all because we have known the characters very well. We get a happy ending for the kid, and while expecting something similar for Willis, we get the infamous twist. The first time I watched it, I was blown away. It feels kind of obvious having it watched so many times now, but man was it incredible! Bruce was dead all the time. This made me analyze some parts. Bruce died with the bullet on his abdomen, and in a scene where he is getting out of a flower shop seeing his wife with another guy, he is clutching the exact place where he was hit. And in every scene after he was shot, his interactions with his wife feel and are obviously him talking to her, but her talking to herself. For a first few views, it is unnoticeable. And, it doesn't even feel that way. Also, Willis is not interacting with physical object. What I thought of a plot hole in the first few viewings were actually genius writing and directing. And I would also like to talk about the horror aspect. It's something I call genuine horror. There are creepy stuff going on and you don't know what is actually happening. It's not a horror movie but has got the elements perfectly. And of all the emotional parts, the final moments after the twist hit perfectly. I wonder why this wasn't an Oscar worthy film.<br/><br/>Bad : Not necessarily bad about the film. But Shyamalan was called the next Spielberg after this film. His next great film was Unbreakable, followed by Split. Split was good, but nowhere near the former two, which was leaps and bounds better than Signs and Glass. And besides these, I don't even want to name the rest of his disasters. I still think he can make real good films, but comparing most of his films, I sadly feel that he was no Spielberg but just a one hit wonder.<br/><br/>Conclusion : It's the greatest Shyamalam film ever. Unbreakable is a close second. Those who think Shyamalan didn't have any potential must watch this. It is just that Shyamalan must have stayed this way. Also, any thriller fans out there? Watch this immediately, if you haven't watched it.<br/><br/>Rating.<br/><br/>Score : absolute 10/10<br/><br/>Grade : A+"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","66","76","8 November 2006"," Still Very Good Even When You Know The Ending
","This was hyped big-time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.<br/><br/>I didn't see it for a few years afterward, on tape and now on DVD. It was very good but I didn't find it as ""the greatest movie ever"" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.<br/><br/>I enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in ""Unbreakable,"" to name another fairly-recent movie) The story is slow-paced but it sure is not boring. In a way, it's nice to see a slower-paced film be a big hit, as this was.<br/><br/>Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.<br/><br/>This isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film."
"Readster","10","192","234","8 December 1999"," One of the films of the Nineties
","This is perhaps my film of the decade so far. The reasons are too numerous to go into in such a short critique. Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.<br/><br/>It is such a relief that the performances of Willis and the excellent Osment live up to an excellently directed quality storyline. I will be disappointed if the youngster doesn't receive at least an academy nomination.<br/><br/>I seldom go to the cinema twice to watch a film, in fact I cannot remember when I have done it before. Tonight I am taking an old friend to see this film as it will be a tragedy if he doesn't see it on the big screen. He has heard so much about it that he is reluctant to go, as I am when something is over-hyped. Just for a change though, here is a film that lives up to its billing and has you thinking about it for weeks to come. As for the twist at the end? Well it totally disorientated me, my mind spinning back throughout the whole film. A fantastic punchline to my film of the year."
"keval","Null","89","116","14 February 2000"," Death, Lfe, Fear and Hope
","Review: The Sixth Sense, Director: M. Night Shyamalam<br/><br/>As a film which has undoubtedly caught the eye of the film going world, it was difficult to avoid the surrounding hype and publicity. Luckily most of the people I had spoken to who had seen the film did not spoil the 'twist' at the end, which, although is rather a laboured point by now in reviews, certainly adds to the ""Oh, I see now"" factor.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a child psychologist played characteristically by Bruce Willis. I say characteristically, because although his portrayal is quite real, and at times touching, there always seems to be an unnerving 'Die Hard'-ness to his speech, lending the dialogue some comical qualities. Having said that, his overall attempts at revealing the vulnerable and disturbed psyche of his character achieve good results. As the psychologist, he is plagued by a particular event in his professional life which he perceives as his personal failure, and sets out to redeem himself by righting the wrong and wiping his failure from his conscience. This opportunity presents itself to him in the form of Cole Sear, played devastatingly well by Hayley Joel Osment. Cole has a problem, he sees dead people. To the outside world he is seen as a loner, a problem child, and has become increasingly isolated. Hence the need for a child psychologist. Once we have been introduced to these two central players, we are taken on a journey of discovery, as both of these characters in the space of the film will learn a great deal about each other, themselves and human nature.<br/><br/>It is this particular point which the film attempts to address so strongly - human communication. That when this breaks down, an inevitable cycle of interpersonal destruction takes course, sometimes irreversible. This is framed within the context of a superbly told ghost story. The sheer truthfulness and honesty with which the concept of fear is expressed by all the characters, is breathtaking. Cole's' experience of the walking dead, appearing out of nowhere, Malcolm's fear of a deteriorating marriage, and Cole's' mother's fear relating to her own existential angst. All of these are played against the backdrop of the often difficult but finally warm relationship between Cole and Malcolm. Eventually, and against the odds, each character displays courage and bravery as they face up to their existential and supernatural fears.<br/><br/>There are one or two niggling problems plot wise, but in a film where the overall atmosphere created is one which encompasses death, fear, and finally hope, it is impossible not to overlook incongruencies. Superb direction, acting and ambience lead me to think that M. Night Shyamalan has really succeeded in telling a chillingly touching story about the triumph of the human spirit.<br/><br/>February 14, 2000 Harshad C. Keval"

"Brogan","Null","51","68","3 August 1999"," A surprising masterpiece!
","Sometime Bruce Willis can make some bad films, like HUDSON HAWK and MERCURY RISING.  And other times he can make some films that change the film industry and blow the audiences away (i.e. DIE HARD triology, 12 MONKEYS, and PULP FICTION).  Now Willis' new film, THE 6th SENSE falls in the latter catageory, as a surprising masterpiece that will leave images stuck in your mind for quite sometime. Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist, who is quite good at his job, he has a loving wife named Anna (played by the beautiful Olivia Williams), and he just got awarded by the mayor of Philadelpia for his excellent work.  Then one night, Malcolm gets a terrifying unexpected visit from one of his former patients.  The visit is so terrifying, that it haunts Malcolm later on. Months later, Malcolm's job is going downhill, and his marriage is falling apart.  Then his life is changed around when he meets Cole, a eight year old boy who is considered a ""freak"" by everybody but his mom.  Cole is usually alone, scared, and has cuts and bruses on his body.  The doctors and social workers think the injuries come from his mom, Lynn Sear (Toni Collette).  But Lynn loves Cole too much that she wouldn't even think of harming him.  The truth is that the injuries that Cole has are from other people,  people that Cole only sees, people that are dead.  Cole sees dead people walking around with the living, and only Cole sees these ghostly figures.  Malcolm tries to help Cole with his unique gift, and to also find out what these ghostly figures want with him. When I saw the trailers for this movie,  it looked like a o.k. movie. Acutally, the preview didn't have any effect on me at all, as for seeing this film.  But when I saw this film, I was blown away on how excellent this was!  This is a highly entertaining film that is scary, sad, funny, and even touching. The plot is brilliant, it has intellegence, and shows the personalities of the characters well enough that you feel like that you know them after the movie is over.  The acting is also great, Willis does a good job as the doctor trying to help poor Cole.  Toni Collette is also great as the suffering mom who's  very worried and protective over Cole. Oliva Williams is good as well as the suffering wife of the doctor who feels that she's losing her husband more and more everyday.  But the real surprise is Haley Joel Osment, who plays the little boy, Cole.  For a child actor he's excellent!  He shows potential to becomming a great actor in years to come.  He's the next promising child actor that will hopefully do well like Elija Wood and Anna Panquin. Overall, THE 6th SENSE took me by surprised, and I ended up loving this film.  I would have to place this film as one of the best films of the year, as well as for the summer films.  And for a PG13 rated film, it's quite scary!  This is one film that no one should miss!!!  ***** (out of five)"

","""I see Dead People!""  Sixth Sense is well worth the ticket price.  It's a tight story and the acting is outstanding.  There are a couple of good scares, rendered more effective because I dropped my guard.  My sixth sense says such was the Writer/Director's express intention. :-)<br/><br/>It's a ghost story yet doesn't rely on special effects and computerization to chill your bones as the Haunting tried to do.  The scares come from the sliver of possibility ""what is happening may be true.""  Well that, and the dropping your guard thing.<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast is outstanding.  Bruce Willis is at his best since Die Hard and The Last Boy Scout.   His patient is 33 years junior to him ( played by Haley Joel Osment) is outstanding.  Truly.  I was mesmerized by his ability to get into this ""sixth sense"" possessed character.  Malcolm and Cole helping each other resolve their problems occurs with good chemistry, and is believable, despite the heights you have to take your mind to believe the story's premise. <br/><br/>I am sooo tempted to give clues on when to grip the one you're with or arms rests a little more tightly; but alas, cannot in good conscience (or for fear of hate mail!)  And out of respect for M. Night Shyamalan for a very good script and story thesis.<br/><br/>Summing: if you're ""only"" looking for the Chill Factor, take in Blair Witch over this one for those final 10 minutes.  The reality factor is stronger, both despite and because of the low budget factors.  But if you want to see one of the best Hollywood manufactured horror films in a long time, give Sixth Sense a chance.  I enjoyed it."

","A child psychologist, played by Bruce Willis, tries to help a troubled boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, who says he sees ghosts.  This film could easily have been one of those dreadful fright night horror flicks played for cheap shocks, aimed at a juvenile mind.  Instead, the film maker chose to tell a story of fragile human feelings, and hidden assumptions.  ""The Sixth Sense"" thus appeals to a more mature audience.<br/><br/>This film is carefully constructed, and deliberately slow, so that we can absorb the excellent cinematography, and have a chance to find clues that will help us avoid preconceived ideas.  But our assumptions are hard to overcome, and most of us are headed for a surprise ending, an outcome which is made possible as a result of superb film editing.<br/><br/>And the acting is well above average.  I would not have cast Willis in the role of the fatherly psychologist, but he is more convincing than I would have predicted.  Osment's performance is as good as I have ever seen for a child actor.  And Toni Collette is totally convincing as the boy's mother. Both Osment and Collette deserved their Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>This film may, or may not, have a subtext.  I found what could be one, but then I may have been reading too much into the story.

Haley Joel Osment was robbed at the Academy Awards, because he gave in this film the single best child performance and one of the greatest performances of all time (adult or child) in this movie. The only child performances that rival his in this movie are Osment's other performances. And let's not forget Olivia Williams who had perhaps the hardest time since she had to play the part that can be viewed on two very different levels. *hint hint* Perfect."
"poolandrews","7","6","7","27 September 2006"," A fine horror film.
","The Sixth Sense is set in Piladelphia where child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) & his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) are enjoying a quiet evening in when one of Malcolm's former patients Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks into his house & shoots him... Jump forward to 'The Next Fall' & Malcolm has a new patient, a young troubled boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who is withdrawn, isolated & seems unhappy. As Malcolm befriends Cole & earns his trust Cole confesses a shocking secret that may well have a great impact on Malcolm himself...<br/><br/>Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan The Sixth Sense was a huge hit back in '99 with 6 Oscar nominations & it became only the fourth horror film to be nominated for best picture, as a film it is as good as ever. The script is somewhat slow & deliberately paced, The Sixth Sense relies on quality storytelling & strong character's for it's impact & entertainment value rather than the recent trend of Hollywood horror films that want to incorporate as many fancy expensive computer graphics as they can. The much talked about & often spoiled twist ending is highly effective especially if you are unaware of it. The character's are well developed & you actually care for them which makes the film what it is, the dialogue is good & I can't remember a single swear word in it. The Sixth Sense is a fantastic modern day ghost story that hits all the right notes & may even bring a tear to a few people's eyes. The only negative is that I don't like long films which The Sixth Sense feels like, that's not a specific problem I suppose as it's a personal preference that I just don't like long films as I lose interest very quickly & that's just the way I am so if your looking for explosions, fights & car chases every five minutes you'd best give this one a miss. When all said & done for what it is it's still a great film though.<br/><br/>Director Shyamalan does a functional job, there's no flashy camera-work here but again this is a film which relies on good storytelling & character's that is set in the real world. Keeping things very low key works well. There's a good atmosphere & some pretty creepy scenes.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of $55,000,000 I don't quite know where the money went & The Sixth Sense doesn't look like it cost 55 big ones. It's flawlessly made & has great production values. The acting is fantastic & everyone puts in a heartfelt performance.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is a great horror film, there's the odd scare, some great performances, an absorbing & engaging story together with a classic twist ending. Well worth a watch, definitely recommended."

","The Sixth Sense is M. Night Shyamalan first big budget and best film. It's a film that heavily relies on the creating and maintaining of a certain atmosphere. It has a psychological tension that's only broken in a few scenes( Magic trick scene ao.). A little comical relief( although there are only 2 such scenes) is very welcome to not make the story too heavy (so everyone can enjoy it). Films tend to get boring if the story is too linear.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense has a surprise ending ( many films will use this in the following years) but it's not all about the ending ( in contrary to certain other films that I will not name to avoid spoiling). The story on itself is very interesting but the ending is the cherry on the pie. Many who saw it the first time were in disbelief: is this right...? After re-watching it several times...yes it is. The plot is almost watertight. I suppose if you want to you can always find tiny little mistakes but I haven't found any big ones. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is unbelievably well cast: Bruce Willis delivers his 2nd best performance( 12 Monkeys is his best), debutant Haley Joel Osment is excellent( his performance in A.I is also excellent, other movies of his were mostly disappointing performances), Toni Colette delivers the first in a long series of Oscar-worthy performances (also see The Night Listener, The Hours, Little Miss Sunshine ao. ) and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg musn't be forgotten even though he only gets 3 minutes of screen time. Olivia Williams may be the only lesser performance in the lead cast but she still does an OK job. <br/><br/>We can see several Shyamalan's trademarks for the first time: He uses very natural colors( brown, white, gray, beige, green) in the interiors and clothing. Another trademark for his work is the fragmentary use of a rich red color to break with the dull colors in the background. He doesn't overuse the red so it preserves its power. We can also see Shyamalan's excellent use of colors in The Village ( even more then in the sixth sense): red stands for evil,misfortune and fear while yellow stands for weakness. The Village is M. Night's third best film in my opinion (Unbreakable is the one that closest approaches TSS brilliance). It's also unbelievably well-acted, the story is strong, the settings are beautiful...definitely worth watching ( if hope you have seen it but if you haven't...you know what to do). It's a bit under-appreciated on IMDb but don't let that fool you.<br/><br/>I'm no direction expert but I found it to be brilliant. The brilliance lies in the details; the excellent use of mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoints,...it's a delight for a filmenthousiast( like yours truly) to watch. You can feel Shyamalan is both writer and director; he knows exactly what to do with the material and which camera shot would be best for which scene.<br/><br/>What makes The Sixth Sense into a brilliant film( what distinguishes it from other great films)? It's hard to explain but it's a magical film to watch. Certainly one of my personal favorite films. <br/><br/>10/10 for this flawless piece of brilliance !!"
"SKG-2","8","57","113","25 August 1999"," Strange but ultimately rewarding
","First of all, I've read a few comments about the pace of this movie being too slow.  I sort of agree with that, but I think it's refreshing to have a movie which takes its time and builds things with subtlety(although here, as I said before, I think it took a little TOO much time).  And I think it was realistic at how long it took for the boy to learn to trust the doctor and for how long it took the doctor to discover what was really going on.<br/><br/>Having said all that, in addition to the pace, there were some times when I felt a little queasy, like I wasn't sure what exactly the movie was trying to say.  At other times, I was caught up in it, especially in the performances of Willis and Osment.  Then came the famous twist ending, and I will tell you that I was quite surprised, and it's making me turn the movie over and over again in my mind. I probably will have to see this again. Overall, while I don't think it's the best of the year, it is a good film."

","Upon first watch of The Sixth Sense, I was hooked and shocked at the same time. I expected a complete horror story, mixed with the usual gore and stomach-churning scenes we ordinarily witness in other movies with a similar theme. The Sixth Sense is anything but. It details the emotional aspects of love and devotion, as well as having to cope with being an outsider.<br/><br/>The purpose of The Sixth Sense is to captivate us into looking and evaluating our own lives, on how we treat ourselves, our husbands and wives and our parents and friends. It details these points to graphic effect.<br/><br/>Young Haley Joel Osment is terrific as Cole, the young boy who sees 'dead people', and portrays his emotions and his mind to an easily captivating audience. Also wonderful to see Bruce Willis turn away from his usual 'action man' sequence to allow us into the equally troubled mind of Dr. Malcolm Crowe.<br/><br/>A divine and heartwarming film combining elements of horror and suspense has made The Sixth Sense an engaging film that is simply unforgettable. It's another firm favourite of mine."
"aimless-46","10","4","5","28 April 2008"," A Classic
","""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion. <br/><br/>But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying. <br/><br/>The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering ""not anymore"", after he has helped Krya. <br/><br/>And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): ""Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too.""<br/><br/>The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

More later, the Doctor sees a traumatized young boy named Cole(Haley Joel Osment), he communicates with dead people who don't know they are dead. Cole's mummy(Tony Colette)is worried about her terrified son's nightmares ,increasing problems and episodes of acting out. Because of this, Cole is named geeky in the college where appear various dead people who ask his help.<br/><br/>The film provides creepy scenes, a well-knit drama, grisly terror when the living dead appear and suspenseful throughout.The flick contains the more famous plot twist from cinema history, because the ending leads to a breathtaking and unexpected outcome on what's happened before. For that reason , gets a highly original and imaginative script by Night Syamalan,-also director and secondary actor, as usual in his films-, and has been copied and imitated several times, such as, Â¨Stir of EchoesÂ¨(David Koepp) and Â¨The othersÂ¨(Alejandro Amenabar). Acting by main actors is top notch, Bruce Willis is magnificent as restrained psychologist and Haley Joel Osment is awesome as traumatized little boy, carrying the movie on his frail shoulders; furthermore, appear future promising actors as Mischa Burton(OC) and Trevor Morgan . Mysterious and sinister cinematographic atmosphere is well made by Tak Fujimoto and eerie soundtrack by James Newton Howard, both are Shyalaman's usual collaborators. The motion picture is produced by famed Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy(Spielberg's producers) and stupendously directed by M. Night Shyamalan."

","A perfect balance. Sad, but not self-pitying. Triumphant, but not cheesy. Frightening, but never grotesque. Shocking, but not gimmicky. Touching without being cheap. Visually it is stunning. There are some truly amazing shots, the attention to color is appreciated. Haley Joel Osment as Cole is extraordinary. What a promising career ahead of him. Bruce Willis, as a workaholic child psychologist, ought to be extremely proud of this, as it may be some of his best work. Tender, brooding, regretful, determined. Perfect. Toni Collette, is really phenomenal. I think she gets overlooked, but with any less talented actress, the film would have certainly suffered.<br/><br/>I watched this film again recently, absolutely certain I would have lost some of the awe I had for it since last watching it on the big screen seven years ago. I was pleasantly surprised. It was just as moving, eerie, and beautiful. An obvious top five film of all time for me. Quite the freshman effort from Mr. Shayamalan."
"isbabo","5","5","7","12 April 2005"," alright but predictable
","This film is alright. The performances are spectacular, which makes it worth seeing. However, like all of Shyamalan's (sp?) films, it is very predictable. Personally, I saw the ending coming with about half the film still to go, and i spent the rest watching just to see if I was right. I had the same problem with the Village, but unlike the Village, The Sixth Sense was made out to be some sort of ending that will shock you. It's worth seeing, if you don't know how it ends just to see if you can figure it out. If you do know how it ends but haven't seen it, rent it just see see Bruce Willis (among many others) give really great performances."

","Award winning child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is confronted and shot by an ex-patient.  Years later he has recovered from this experience and begins to treat a child who suffers from similar problems.  The young boy, Cole, claims to see dead people and requires Crowe's constant attention - to the detriment of his marriage.  With Cole becoming increasingly scared and withdrawn, Crowe is his last hope.<br/><br/>This film is an old-fashioned ghost story, replacing gore with a genuine spooky atmosphere.  The story is deceptively simple and plays almost innocently for the whole film until Cole's visions are revealed.  The true genius of the story isn't revealed until the final twist when we see how we have been duped by a good director!  Even without the twist, this is still a good film - the story of Cole is well done and is chilling and frightening sometimes.  However it is also quite human, as it is essentially the story of Cole overcoming his fears.<br/><br/>Willis delivers a careful, understated performance.  His choices in recent years have been remarkably good (with some exceptions).  This is just yet another great role from a man who's career looked like it was dying after ""striking distance"" and ""colour of night"".  He hits just the right note here.  I'm not a big fan of child actors as a rule, but Osment is really good here - never falling into the ""cute child"" category.  I don't know if he should have got the Oscar, but he's still good.  The rest of the cast are good, but really it's the central relationship between Willis and Osment that makes this film.<br/><br/>The plot may have some holes in (some ghosts hang around where they died, one comes to find Cole etc), but overall this is very good.  The director weaves an interesting story that stands on its own, but makes it even more memorable by challenging how we accept and assume things in movies by delivering a great, clever twist at the end."
"Rockford_6","8","6","9","30 August 2008"," Shyamalan
","I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane. Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that. My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress. THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters. That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start. (The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.) ""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it. Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this? ""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium."" That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all."

","I was 32 years old when this movie was released in theaters and I was already a hardened veteran of horror movies. I've seen pretty much every decent supernatural horror movie at that time. But when I saw this one, I was both embarrassed and genuinely impressed at just how scared I was after. In fact, I was actually glad I was that affected. I've been chasing that dragon ever since. I lived in a really cool creepy Gothic Victorian house at the time, and for a short time after seeing that film, I slept with my lights on. All the scenes where Cole saw the ""dead people"" were masterfully filmed to truly frighten. The lighting, timing and that ever present feeling of visceral dread, acted to perfection by Haley Joel Osment. It had a certain Kubrickian quality to the cinematography with the slow panning wide angle shots. In my opinion, this movie is M. Night Shyamalan's singular masterpiece. It's the perfect ghost story with a twist."

"zkonedog","10","3","4","4 March 2017"," The Way Cinema Is Supposed To Work
","Is there such a thing as a ""perfect movie""? If that concept does indeed exist, than ""The Sixth Sense"" comes about as close as possibly to taking that prize. It contains everything one could ask for in a film.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who is prone to visions of dead ghosts and as such is not fitting in very well at school or at home. With the help of a very unique child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), however, Cole is finally able to face his fears and begin to move on with his life.<br/><br/>Since it is easier to come at this review from this angle, about the only people who WON'T enjoy this movie are those who only like the mindless actions of explosions, car chases, and flexing muscles. Not to disparage those films or their audiences, but if that is the only kind of fare that gets you revved up in the theater, then this one might not be for you.<br/><br/>For everyone else, though, ""Sixth Sense"" is almost a clinic in how to make a movie that will keep the audience engaging in nearly every way possible. It is the kind of film that one cannot say too much about or risk major spoilers, but suffice it to say that it is filled with mystery, layer upon layer of plots, terrific acting, suspense, and a jaw-dropping finale that will have you rebooting the whole experience again very soon! Though perhaps not by a humongous margin (as ""Signs"" is excellent in its own right), ""Sixth Sense"" is the hallmark film from director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is the perfect showcase for the type of movies he enjoyed making.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is easily in my Top Ten Films of All-Time mental list, and perhaps even encroaching on the Top Five. It is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word. If for some reason you haven't seen it, it may just fundamentally change the way you view cinema forever."
"ironhorse_iv","9","3","4","19 January 2017"," Have some common sense. Go get the Sixth Sense. It's a horror masterpiece!
","According to director/writer M. Night Shyamalan, the idea of making a horror movie about children seeing ghost; first came to him, while watching an old 1990's Nickelodeon show called 'Are You Afraid of the Dark: titled, 'Tale of the Dream Girl"" (1994), directed by David Winning. Hoping to capitalize on that success, he wrote and pitch a similar idea to studios as a kid movie, until rewrites made the script's subject matter, more mature and harder to sell. That's until, the most unlikeable of sources, came to him, looking to buy it, which was Walt Disney Studios. It seem that then-president of production, David Vogel read Shyamalan's spec script and instantly loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights, despite the high price tag of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film. While, Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, and apparently show little confidence in the film value, by selling the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining a few distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office receipt. They still greenlit the project and gave their share. Lucky for them, the film was the biggest jackpot gamble win of all time, becoming one of biggest box-office hits of the 1990s. The reasons, why everybody loves it, are very clear. The film's chilly astrosphere, acting, and unexpected twist ending are some of the best moments, cinema can give you. It was a very memorable movie from a then-unknown director. The story of redemption was also great, with 'Six Sense' telling the story of a once-prideful disheartened child psychologist, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), dedicated himself, by trying to cure a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) from being traumatic by the spirits of the dead. Without spoiling the movie, too much, after watching this film the first time through without spoilers, it is almost impossible to watch it again without seeing obvious foreshadowing, during the second watch. Still, this movie has a lot of rewatch value. I love how the movie has a Hitchcockism/Kubrickism feel to it, as there was a lot of carefully devised storytelling, going on here with the visuals without using too much dialogue. Some great examples are, how the color red was prominent whenever the worlds of the living and the dead came together, follow by visible cold breathing and shivers. Wonderful use of foreshadowing. Added to the tension that is already brought by the wonderful make up effects, sound mixing and haunting soundtrack by composer, James Newton Howard. Another brilliant example of visuals using as foreshadowing, is how everybody's clothes seem heavy wore, their normal hair seem a bit grey/white, and how they barely interact with their surroundings. I like how the filmmaker were very careful, not to spoil the clues of the true state of any of the characters, too much. They were even worry that Cole's iconic, and highly quoted, revealed at the hospital might have spoil the movie for everybody. Lucky for them, most of the audience still, didn't see the twist coming. Another magnificent thing, Shyamalan does well is using reflecting surfaces such as glasses, mirrors, windows, and other reflecting surfaces for a slew of dramatic and thematic reasons. You really get to see, good examples of that, whenever, Malcolm is looking at his depressed wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). Nevertheless, perhaps the best shot in the film, at least for me, was the extreme close-up of the bright silver door knob in the 3rd act with a distorted image of Cole. It was both scary and clear transparent to a positive change. It's great to see, a horror movie, that doesn't end with a downer. Another great use by the director, was the idea of using long take to establish important character relations. We see this, compositional strategy, during the first official meeting between Cole and Malcolm. Not only, does it build a special bond between the two leads, but it gives the impression that Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette) and Malcolm were perhaps are at the end of a conversation about him. Almost tricking the audience. Nevertheless, if they did talk, the dialogue would had been cheesy. As much, as I love, everybody acting, particular Osment. Some of the lines, they were given to say, were a bit silly. A good example of this, was any of the scenes with Lynn and Cole. Seeing them, argue and later, embrace in the car about a Bumble-bee Pen felt a little odd and humorous. It wasn't as intimacy as it should be for me. Still, Toni Collette has said that she was so moved by the emotional resonance of the story while filming, she did not even realize it was a horror film until after its release. Anyway, I think the scenes with Malcolm and Anna, had a more emotional impact on me, than any of the scenes with the Sears interacting with each other. Overall: While, the dialogue writing isn't the best and can be highly spoof by later films. Not even, the awful director cameo by M. Night can hurt this movie. Regardless of what you know, think of M. Night Shyamalan's work since this film. His first horror movie is often viewed as one of the best, and I have to agree. It's worth checking out."

","The Sixth Sense is an effective thriller with a good twist ending from director M Night Shyamalan whose admirable in making this movie which was his first back in 1999. His other films that followed haven't even been on par with this one but thats okay. The cast are good in their roles including Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and especially Haley Joel Osment as the boy who can see dead people. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. Its best to see this without knowing too much about the film because that will ruin some of the surprises including a revelation about one of the main characters. This film does have a little suspense and creepy moments but there could have been more of them. This film felt a bit like a drama with thriller and supernatural elements which wasn't a bad thing. The music by James Newton Howard seems to sync very well with the tone of the film and what was happening on the screen. The creepy moments usually involving a dead person being seen are well executed and paced. This is a movie you'll want to see twice so you can pick up on things you didn't notice before the first time around. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws. Overall The Sixth Sense is a solid thriller with some suspense, creepy moments, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch."

The bedroom scene with the doctor and his wife was what a shocking good thriller is made of. Donny Wahlberg is a terrifying short detour in this right-made enthraller that packs a whopping cast that has authentic developed personalities with an eerie undertone. Bruce again shows that he is the right choice for a major story that captivates from the start to the end. You feel for Malcom Crow, as he seems to be searching for truth and help for this young boy. The mother has a real appeal in that (Toni Colette is superb)the actress is a well crossed role player that seems like there is just no-acting there. She is on it. All the while, there are scenes that are not 'shot' impatiently. I think that so much of Hollywood is cutting, cutting, cutting to make the scheduled time box that the formula fits into. The visual chemistry woven is done almost with a cinematic respect for the classic film noir, they are held in the length that makes them perfect grippers, you see what's happening and it gives enough 'pause' then makes you feel the chill across the back of your neck. When the story captives and the performances are cut to fit as right as this is, you know that not all movies are even. Not by a long shot. Bruce Willis has a definite old world quality of acting, in a new world format. This movie unfolds with precision in story telling and character development with the good Doctor and the boy and then when it goes to the end, it twists and you are left feeling that cold chill once again. I only had one question that I would like to ask 'M' about the plot. Other than this, I am well pleased with ""The Sixth Sense"".<br/><br/>For what a superb thriller should be, this one is a top pick. It's 'incredible' the success that The Sixth Sense has had, it is no wonder to me and millions of fans, and in that, Willis with his contract and profit agreement took away with him One Hundred Million Dollars. Some might say that he isn't one hundred million good. Some might say, the Razzies gave him three awards for worst actor just the year before, I say, none of that 'banter' will change a wit about Bruce in this film. <br/><br/>Recommended for M.Night Shyamalan and Willis fans, even if you aren't it really makes no difference in the end you will know why.

","We all know the ending by now, so I won't pretend no one knows how it ends. A suspenseful return back into the world of ghost stories carries The Sixth Sense, the first major film success by M. Night Shyamalan. The film revolves around a child, Cole Sear, who is socially awkward mainly because he can see ghosts and struggles with that each day, played by Haley Joel Osment in an Oscar Award nominated role. Bruce Willis plays Malcome Crowe, a child case worker who invests all of his time into Cole. As he investigates what is happening, he finds that he has come across a case similar to Cole's in the past, but is no nearer to figuring out how to help him. The human drama of a case worker trying to figure out what is wrong with his patient keeps the movie going, allowing Shyamalan to drop the clues throughout the movie about the ending. I have to admit I was blown away by the ending, but looking back, I should have known better, and many audiences were able to figure it all out. Some say that if you look at the movie logically, it does not hold water, but that is not the point. The movie is not about logic, but rather the experience as a viewer, watching what the director gives us, as we only see what he wants us to see. The Sixth Sense also boasts a strong soundtrack and looks good, setting a mood that gets the audience in the right frame of mind to be spooked, though it's not a horror movie. Suspenseful, smart, and well directed, The Sixth Sense is an achievement not to be underestimated."

No, he simply must save a little boy called Cole, haunted by morbid visions and Willis, a reputable psychologist tries hard to heal him... With ""fight club"" and ""the blair witch project"", ""the sixth sense"" ranks among the best movies made in 1999. It also ranks among the movies that you must watch several times before really appreciating it. If you're watching this movie for the first time, you might be disappointed because there are numerous details that can escape your attention and however, they are important for the development of the story. The same thing can also be said for a few scenes, especially the one when Willis is in a restaurant with his wife facing him... Because the main strength of the movie is its screenplay. Rarely, a movie has been so well served by a watertight screenplay. It's disconcerting, disturbing and however perfectly coherent. For a long part, the movie is a beautiful ""trompe l'oeil"". On another hand, it's a pleasure to see Bruce Willis get out of his usual roles where he mostly plays the he-man. In ""the sixth sense"", it's obvious that he's between the hands of a conscientious and well-organized director. But he isn't the main center of the movie. This place goes to Haley Joel Osment. His performance in the role of a tormented and neurotic boy is extraordinary. Besides, he can be considered as a faraway cousin of Danny, the little boy in Kubrick's ""shining"" because they've got a common point: an odd power supernatural and all in all, the dead people who haunt Cole aren't so terrible as they look like: they're simply asking him for help... At the end, a fascinating movie held up by two great actors."

","I realize this film had many good reviews. That's why I bought it. But it somehow managed to get by me without hooking me in. Its lack of impact had little to do with the acting, which is pretty good all around. Toni Collette is especially noteworthy. And Willis gives what is for him a subdued performance except, I have to say, that when he tries to grin with happiness or gets misty eyed with love, something within me begins to churn. The kid, Osment, is okay. Thank God he's not a cutie-pie.<br/><br/>The direction is deliberate but effective, supported by a semi-somnolent score that throws in a sting from time to time, as when the first ghost appears briefly, to wake the audience up.<br/><br/>The plot, alas, is a mish mash of overly familiar themes. Is it RIGHT to try to cure a kid who seems to know more than we do? (Cf., ""Equus."") Even if the kid is frightened by the ""dead people"" he sees, who sometimes scream at him and scratch him? (Cf., ""The Shining."") How come the kid speaks Latin? (Cf., ""The Exorcist."") Or is this the momentary hallucination of someone who is dying? (Cf., ""Incident at Owl Creek Bridge,"" or ""Point Blank."") Who are these ghosts anyway? Why do they taunt the kid? Why does he see only tortured ones, people who have been hanged, poisoned, killed in car accidents, shot in the belly, or who slashed their wrists? Do they see each other? Do they eat and excrete? They seem to have the power to move objects in their environment. They can steal bumblebee pendants or scratch the kid. <br/><br/>They can, to give a more specific example, shove a box containing an incriminating tape out from under a bed and ask Osment to show the tape to their bereaved father. Well then why can't they themselves give Dad the box? Or leave it where he's bound to find it? If someone has done them dirt why must they use Osment as the middleman? Why not just kick ass? <br/><br/>Oh, and a final question. By the end of the film we know why Osment finally spills the beans to Willis, but why on earth hasn't he told his mother about it a long time ago? ""I'm ready to communicate with you,"" he tells her solemnly when they're trapped in a traffic jam. Well, why now?<br/><br/>There is one way, though, in which the plot is cleverly constructed. In fact, the surprise revelation seems to have been thought of first and the entire movie structured around this anagnorisis. Yes, the story is as full of holes as a slice of Emmenthaler cheese but the whole point is the onion soup beneath. That climactic twist is a big relief in another way. Now we know why nobody wants to talk to Bruce Willis except Osment. And it's not his aftershave lotion.<br/><br/>It's a pretty gloomy picture actually, awfully low key, though the photography of Philadelphia is engaging. Willis and his wife, Olivia Williams, are shown admiring an award he has just won, as the film opens. They're drinking wine and joking about Dr. Seuss, but even then there's no exhilaration on the screen.<br/><br/>However, people seem to have given this film a cornucopia of plaudits so the weakness may be mine rather than the story's. There is no statistically significant difference between women and men in the user ratings -- he said confidently after merely eyeballing the results. I would have predicted a greater appeal for women. Maybe you'll get more out of it than I did."

I didn't like the story. I know Shyamalan tends to have twists in his movies, but the twist in this one didn't impress me. Maybe I spoiled the viewing experience for myself since I knew to look for the twist. Maybe I should have seen this movie when it came out to enjoy it more. Much of this comes down to my personal preference. And to be honest I don't like Shyamalan's directional style. The long takes were not that good. I didn't like his framing either.<br/><br/>The movie was okay on the acting front. I liked Haley Joel Osment's performance. Bruce Willis and the rest of the cast were okay. M.

Twenty minutes into the film and I could see the twist at the end of the movie. They show the psychologist being shot at almost point blank range and then the same psychologist is shown moving with a child that can see dead people. To add to this, we see the psychologist being ignored by all, except this child! Does it take anything more for one to guess the twist?

The Sixth Sense was hyped as a supernatural thriller with an unexpected twist.

But the idea that the Bruce Willis character could go for a year and realise that he was dead (whoops! did I spoil the ending for anyone?) is just plain ludicrous. Didn't he notice that everyone - not just his wife was ignoring him? Besides these stupidities the film was slow and dull, and about as scary as an episode of The Munsters."

He is able to have conversations with his wife while he is a ghost for an entire year and not figure out that he is dead? How can such conversations occur? They can't! There is no way possible that he could have gone an entire year and have these conversations with his wife. Conversations like Bruce Willis would ask a question and his wife would conveniently be thinking about the same topic and speak out loud and give an answer while not aware that Bruce Willis was there talking to her. How come Bruce Willis who is supposed to be dead doesn't have any wounds on him like the other dead people do? Why isn't the kid afraid of Bruce Willis like he is afraid of the other dead people?

Just look at that wake where Haley reveals the message from the dead girl. Unforgivably lame. All the jolts are underline by a vulgar strike in the music score department. Really bad. Mr Night Shaymalan got very luck in 1999 and has not been able to repeat its fortune since, no matter the obvious, desperate attempts to grab another jackpot. ""The Happening"" was unwatchable, ""Lady In The Water"" the work of someone with a an alarming mounting ego. ""Signs"" another clumsy, half cooked semi idea.

Think about it! seriously. This movie reminds me of Arlington Road and Reindeer Games in that the movie doesn't make sense if you sit down and rationally think about it. I mean, Bruce Willis has been dead for a year, an entire year. Don't you think he'd notice, particualrly that NO ONE talks to him, NO ONE except Osment! At one point, he says he ""barely talks"" to his wife anymore. Well, ""barely"" is different than ""none"" which would be the reality. Maybe I'm being too critical, but to me, a GREAT movie, like voters here have determined this is by putting it in the top 50 of ALL TIME, should really hold up to repeat viewings. I really have a feeling time is going to trivialize this one and reveal what it really is: a smart, but slow, effective thriller.<br/><br/>One final note: while the Sixth Sense got way too much hype, UNBREAKABLE didn't get nearly enough.

","Contains Spoiler<br/><br/>
The Sixth Sense is a good horror film if viewed only once. Additional viewing's unveil numerous inconsistencies and the blatant manipulations of the director.  Really now, are we to believe that the main character, as played by Bruce Willis, is oblivious to the fact that since his traumatic experience of being shot, no living person is aware of his existence? Where does he get the referral for the young boy at the start of the film? Another disembodied dead psychologist I guess.  Bruce Willis's character laments that he rarely (actually never) converse's with his wife or anybody else for that matter. We're supposed to believe that for a full year he wanders through life oblivious to the fact that no one acknowledges his presence. Horror films such as Psycho, Rosemary's Baby or The Shining stand up to repeated viewings because the essential story line of these films remains consistent and plausible within the world created by the director.  There is a richness of ideas in these films that can be continually unearthed. The Sixth Sense is a one shot wonder, a good one at that, but it does not stand up to subsequent viewing's."
"AntiSpielbergForce","1","12","28","30 January 2009"," I see morons and imbeciles
","Everybody's favourite ""intelligent"" horror/mystery-thriller, with everybody's favourite twist ending. You already know the story, so I'll fast-forward directly to the bashing.<br/><br/>Shyamalan fancies himself a great artist, not content with ""only"" telling a story. Fair enough. The last positive thing I will say in this review is that he has a keen eye for cinematography, if nothing else. Unfortunately, pretty pictures and ""art shots"" are not enough to make a good director, or film, and cinematography is indeed the movie's actual preoccupation. Manoj deliberately tries to carve out visual trademarks by over-staging every scene, and this takes up a large part of the near two hours. The colour red is seen here and there, carrying ""symbolic significance"". A good director would spend his time inspiring his actors to pass for human beings, but then again, Mr. Night might not be a good director. Few characters in his pictures actually behave like real people.<br/><br/>And acting here is non-existent. A vacuum. In Shyamalan's other movies, at least people appear to be reading from scripts. Now, Bruce Willis is one of the few remaining action stars with trace amounts of Y-chromosomes, and has charisma enough to carry a movie, but his talents for ""subtle"" drama like this are somewhat yonder. Frankly, I can't think of a less suitable actor for this kind of role (child psychologist). Sure enough, within the first five minutes we are treated to a prolonged shot of an award plaque, with Willis' wife actually spelling out for us the superlatives it contains. This is so that we'll know that Willis' character is ""brilliant"". Manoj misunderstood the concept of ""show, don't tell"", a fundamental narrative tool, which means that Willis shows us his brilliance through his actions, not by bluntly telling us ""he's brilliant!"". Low class there, but it gets even worse.<br/><br/>The kid does nothing but whisper through the entire movie. This is his brilliant, Oscar-nominated acting? Other than that, people sit around a lot, broods a lot, whispers some more. The kid sees dead people everywhere, which gives rise to a bunch of ""scary moments"" (with loud music playing every time a closet door suddenly opens, or whatever), but without actually advancing the story. They're just there for cheesy ""Boo! I bet you didn't see THAT coming!"" effects that were old news in the '70s already. The entire middle half of the movie is superfluous and could be cut out, since it seems to have little to do with the framing device, which is Willis' character. Really, time has never moved slower than when watching this movie.<br/><br/>As for weak horror, the kid actually states early on that the ghosts are looking for ""help"" rather than haunting or causing mischief. OK, so there is not even a threat of harm? Then what is the point of having scene after scene with ""made you jump!""-scares, when our beloved heroes are not even in danger at any one point? I'll tell you the point, the point is to water down the ""horror"" genre to be suitable for children, which ideally will broaden the revenue base. Producers didn't take long to understand this, and now this kind of diaper horror is the norm.<br/><br/>Plot holes abound. The biggest is that Willis' dead character doesn't notice, until the very end of the movie, that nobody except the boy (who is some kind of medium) interacts with him. Willis meets with the kid in a professional context, but who made the appointment with Willis, if he was already dead? The kid himself? I don't THINK so. Later, Willis has been let into the house of the boy's mother, and the mother is actually sitting there next to him. They never interact. Yet we are to believe that Willis was let into the house and seated, and neither greeted nor was seen by the kid's mother, who was SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM AT THE START OF THE SCENE. Yet another scene has dead Willis eating dinner with his wife. Apparently, they didn't speak to each other, and Willis didn't notice this? Manoj tricks the audience here, by having the wife talk to herself in such a manner that it APPEARS that she is talking to Willis.<br/><br/>There are enough absurdities here to build a ladder to the moon, which M. Night and his fanboys have tried to justify with the cop-out notion that ""Willis only sees what he wants to see"". Neat, isn't it? Sure spares Shyamalan the effort of wrapping up the mess he created. Suffice it to say that the perhaps most telling sign of a director's incompetence is that he has to cheat his audience in order to keep the story together. Even Spielberg, the devil's handpicked lieutenant on earth, doesn't resort to this low form of audience manipulation.<br/><br/>Personally, I find that movies that rely on gimmick twists, as opposed to honest atmosphere and ACTING, do not hold up to repeated viewings. Even if your IQ is likely to turn up on a craps roll, and you DIDN'T see the twist coming, how can you watch this hogwash over again KNOWING what will be the big surprise? The disturbing part is that millions of drugged lemmings actually DID go to see this movie a second time, to pick up all the clues that made them miss the finale the first time around. The nightman got rich, and invested his efforts in another triumphant masterpiece, ""Unbreakable"".<br/><br/>Here's my screenplay: Bruce Willis gets shot. Dies. The end. Osment and Manoj remain unknown.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is a disease. I've seen a number of his movies just to reassure myself, and the man is a complete criminal. I am on a crusade, and I will not rest until he is indicted for his offences against art, taste and logic.<br/><br/>Lowest possible rating."

Any potential suspense is nullified in the opening 15 minutes, when it is explained that the apparitions seen by Haley Joel Osment's character are appealing to him for assistance, rather than having any sinister intentions. Therefore, no matter in what manner the spectres appear, the audience has already been made aware that no harm is intended to the major character and that to classify the film as a horror is wide of the mark, as no threat or danger is present in any scene. This leads the audience to then cogitate on the big ""twist"" which is central to the plot (and I would even go so far as to say that it is the only plot in the whole turgid affair). I'm afraid to say that I worked this out within the first half an hour, leading to an excruciating remainder of the film, where it is consistently rammed down your throat that the kid sees dead people, the kid helps dead people and that Brucey's character is seen by the kid. Even my friend (who I went to the cinema with) who didn't work out the ending said that it was unadulterated trite, so I should thank him for my summary line, as I couldn't have expressed this film in a single phrase any better than this.

"HelloTexas11","8","4","7","6 January 2008"," the ultimate twist ending
","This might be the spoiler to beat all spoilers- Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), one of the two main characters in 'The Sixth Sense,' is actually dead through most of the movie and the audience doesn't know it. Thanks to an extremely clever and manipulative plot and a spectacularly successful twist ending, most people ended up going back to see 'The Sixth Sense' a second time, just to pick up all the 'clues' they missed the first time, and which are indeed there for anyone to see. The thing is, hardly anyone does. The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough success, grossing over $600 million worldwide (all those second and third viewings helped big-time) and one wonders if it wasn't at least partially a fluke. With the exception of 'Signs,' none of his other films has been a success, either critically or at the box office. The approach that worked so well in 'Sixth Sense' does not appear to be readily transferable to other material. But 'Sixth Sense' is a certifiable masterpiece of horror and suspense. It benefits greatly from young Haley Joel Osment's totally believable performance as Cole Sear, the nine-year-old boy who ""sees dead people."" The state of anxiety and fear he lives in is transmitted to the audience beyond the point of feeling sympathy for him; we actually come to feel the emotions he feels. No one except Cole can see the dead, but Shyamalan does not resort to trickery or suggestion in this regard: the deceased are right out in the open for the audience to see. One might think this would be the film's fatal flaw. It is certainly audacious. At one point in 'Sixth Sense,' when Dr. Crowe asks Cole if there are any dead persons present, the boy says there are, and sure enough, in the background are three gruesomely made-up figures hanging from the rafters. Similarly, later on, when a cyclist is killed in an accident and Cole and his mother are stuck in traffic as a result, the dead cyclist is shown standing right outside their car, peering in the passenger window. Cole's expression seems to be one of ""here we go again,"" and is almost grimly humorous. But it all works and somehow proves to be very frightening. This straightforward approach to things that are usually only hinted at or seen in fleeting glimpses (one might contrast this with the first 'Alien' film, where the creature is never fully seen till the very end) turns out to be quite refreshing and most effective. Bruce Willis underplays his character, which is essential for the ending to work. Throughout the film, we are led to believe that his marriage is at the end of its rope, and that his wife's refusal to speak to him or even acknowledge him is simply a manifestation of that fact. All of this is masterfully played out and when at the climax, we learn his wife has never answered him because he hasn't been there, it comes as a complete shock. If AFI ever does a list of '100 Greatest Surprise Endings,' 'The Sixth Sense' will surely top the list."

The twist at the end is nothing more than a cheap gimmick, it doesn't take much to throw that in the script, whether you saw it coming or not. The acting is ok, but at the end of the day there's not much depth or substance to this. People don't see dead people, if they did, I could easily imagine just about any other film taking the subject further. I believe to a point it even detracts or mocks a real situation where young children develop mental illnesses."

I somehow had it spoiled for me long before I saw the movie, but found it completely unentertaining because aside from the suspense and the ""ohh"" moment, there's nothing valuable at all about The Sixth Sense.

The plot of this slow-building horror-noir, heavily drawing on cult classics like the certain 1980 movie directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick, is not without merits, courtesy of a poignant treatment of a disturbed, misunderstood child prodigy. The supernatural elements of the film, on the other hand are contrived to such extremes that they are not believable at all and lack the power to truly frighten. Bruce Willis, as the child psychologist with a tough case and an unhappy marriage, should be given proper credit for restrained, realistic acting. But neither he, nor his gifted young patient can fix the holes in the scenery, which, if properly scrutinized, will reveal inexcusable and ludicrous inconsistencies. The consistently solemn, dour tone set to painfully conventional ""gloomy suspense"" music, does not improve the picture either; and the so-called ""surprise ending"" which everyone seems to be so fascinated with, makes VERY LITTLE SENSE if given sufficient thought."

Bruce dies, in the beginning, but we are not 'officially' told this until the supposedly twist ending, and then becomes a friend of a kid who sees dead people. but the red hearings we keep seeing to keep us from this twisted are misleading and in the end, i felt betrayed. the kids sees dead people, Bruce is dead. all the other dead people's wounds can be seen, not Bruce's. not until the end. misleading. all the scenes where the kid starts talking to Bruce, he is supposed to be interacting with the kid's mom or others and such. its supposed to be cool that he isn't really and we are not supposed to notice that. so in the end, we are only tricked into thinking this. but as the rest of the dead people are replaying out what was their life before they died or how they died. Bruce is on an unknown to him mission. very good idea if properly written into the movie. but what ruins it is the kid must know Bruce is dead and says nothing about it. all the rest of the dead people scare the crap out of this kid, but not dead Bruce. and then why does Bruce not realize no one else but the kid is answering him? the unknown mission is to save the second daughter from being poisoned to death by her mom. again, the kid is scared of the ghost girl first daughter while she leads him to the video she made of mom poisoning her. OK, cool, but why didn't she run away instead? but that whole bit seemed so out of place with the rest of the movie even if you did know the twist. why not have the twist realized before this part and then realize that's why Bruce is stuck haunting this kid to finish this mission. otherwise, how did Bruce and the kid really find out about Munchhausen mom? how is it not better to have a tighter better written script with the same twists?"

I think the reason is that it didn't make sense. I'm about to ruin the ending for you if you haven't seen the movie yet, but I know you've already seen it. So this kid who is terrified of dead people, even though you'd think he'd be used to be them by now, deals with his fear by spending all his time with a supposedly brilliant dead psychologist who goes for a year without knowing he's dead even though this troubled child is the only person he communicates with. That's the whole plot.<br/><br/>Besides the inconsistencies in the plot, there was nothing about the movie that was the least bit scary. Yes, I get that the kid could see dead people. But that's all. They weren't trying to drown him or eat him. They were just there. One's ability to be scared by this hinges on their belief that death is in and of itself scary. But if you're not really afraid of death, which I'm not because it's inevitable, then the only thing that will sicken you will be the unrealistic, mind-numbingly dull dialogue that has become a trademark of all Shyamalan films."

Bruce Willis is on top of a list of people who bluffed themselves by some sheer quirk of luck into the cinema back in the glory days of bad films (80s/90s). If this film had been made in Britain or Europe with actors who can act, it would have been wonderful. Brucie is a 'deez' 'dem' 'doze' guy. He's always in an action film no matter what he does. He can barely read the script. The young boy in the story and his mother are great, but Willis' presence knocks them down every time. He turns what could be a nice scary thriller into comic book stuff. He's especially awful during his scenes where he has to show some emotion. One can only think of the line about early Hepburn, ""Let's go see Katharine Hepburn act the gamut from A to B."" Willis is more like 'A to A minus'. He's terrible when he talks.

","M. Night Shymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of his two best movies. The skill by which the development and resolution of this bizarre and chilling classic make it a modern landmark. Just by this movie alone, Night established himself as Hitchcock's successor. To describe anything more than a bare-bones rendering of the plot would be irresponsible, but here it goes... Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children. Soon he meets up with the weaknesses of his past and must suffer the consequences. For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority. The juggle isn't easy, and he falters, but is honest, in both attempts to make up mistakes for his past. The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating. The tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling. The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever. Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not ""the"" best) childhood performances on film. The supporting cast is remarkable as well. Perhaps critics have given 'The Sixth Sense' grudging praise, for it means to unveil the supernatural in a way that is meant to mirror the real world in an unflattering way.

Along with the spectacular ending the movie was just spooky enough to keep me alert looking for what would happen next.

","Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe takes on the case of a deeply troubled boy named Cole Sear. At first Cole is reluctant to be helped, but as Malcolm gets closer to the boy, Malcolm learns the root of Cole's fears, he claims he sees ghosts.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense was a monster hit back in 1999, a deftly crafted ghost story with a kicker that was talked about by all and sundry, the box office bulged and the critics did rave. Nowadays you will find hundreds of people proclaiming that the film is boringly formulaic, that they worked out the film's premise easily in the first quarter of the film, or that the film is a mere cliché, funny how I don't remember it like that back in 1999! The box office bulged because many went to see the film more than once, they went (myself included) back to see just how director M. Night Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Director) managed to bluff us and pull the rug from under our feet. I remember vividly both times I saw it in the cinema, the crucial turning point of the piece bringing a collective audible gasp from the viewers sunken in their respective seats, that's the sort of impact that carries a film's reputation far and wide, and that's the reason why I will never rate the film lower than 10/10.<br/><br/>Repeat viewings of The Sixth Sense obviously dim its star appeal because we know the tricks of the directors trade, but the film still ranks to me as one of the best of its type for so many other reasons rarely mentioned. The writing from Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Screenplay) is surprisingly complex, the piece masquerading as a horror picture is emotionally charged, linking children with the paranormal through loss and a need for understanding, the need for closure of unresolved differences, but chiefly and crucial to the film's heart is the message of connection before it's too late.<br/><br/>The performances are incredible, Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe is perfectly understated, all the pointers for the denouement are there for us to see, but such is the actors performance, and we now know he is cutely having to play his cards close to his chest, are hidden from us until the revisit of the picture reveals it all. Hayley Joel Osment (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actor) is wonderful, for a child performance in a film of this type to not be over sentimental, is quite an achievement. Sympathetic Cole may be, but Osment never lets it become less than the accepted level of child vulnerability. Rounding out the great trio of leads is Toni Collette (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actress) as Cole's mother, Lynn, fabulous in portraying the love and confusion in Cole's troubled world, this story arc between the two is expertly realised. The direction from Shyamalan is very restrained, forgoing out and out shock value for periods of disquiet, he uses sounds to make the audience sense the unease unfolding in this creepy tale, while his camera work, full of draw ins and pull outs-and subtle side shifts, is adroitly in tone with the narrative. The score from James Newton Howard flits beautifully between the uneasy periods and the sustained moments of query, while Tak Fujimoto's cinematography puts a gorgeous funereal texture over this part of Philadelphia.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it then don't believe the naysayers, because The Sixth Sense deserved every penny/cent it made, its a wonderful, creepy, and yes, at times, a beautiful picture. A film that still ranks as one of the best ghost stories ever crafted. 10/10"

The biggest surprise was the ending, but only in the first viewing, then it becomes useless for other viewings.  This drama (not thriller), is just average when you get down to it."

I admit it, when I was young I tried watching every 'Twilight Zone' episode and learned something that some modern Hollywood writers still haven't caught on to.<br/><br/>I hate obvious twists like this movie because it is totally unimaginative. The premise is simple: a 2 hour film about a boy who sees dead people.  Make us sit through said film and experience Osment's unbearable acting and silly shock scenes.<br/><br/>Then in the end, poke us in the eye and say ""Ha ha, it was all a farce. Bruce Willis was really dead all along.""  As if a thousand episodes of what Rod Serling wrote 50 years ago hasn't prepared us for that.<br/><br/>If the film provides its twists earlier enough to have fun with them ('Fight Club') or leaves itself open for new twists ('The Wall', 'Usual Suspects') I can have some fun with it.  Instead, Shyamalan wants to be Spielberg and have everything open-and-shut but the material demands otherwise.<br/><br/>So, Willis is dead and that's the end of it.  Case closed, he ceases to exist.

"Boba_Fett1138","10","4","8","28 July 2004"," An original new kind of horror movie.
","With the coming of ""The Sixth Sense"" M. Night Shyamalan (how to pronounce it, I have no idea!) introduced a new kind of horror. The kind of horror that is more psychological than it is scary, although ""The Sixth Sense"" still has some good scares! The movie inspired many other movies like for example ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman but also M. Night Shyamalan kept making movies in this new kind of horror style, movies like ""Signs"" and his most recent one ""The Village"".<br/><br/>It's hard to say what it is that makes this movie such a masterpiece. It might be because of the superb mix of drama, thriller and horror elements. A thing why all these elements flow so well isn't only thanks to the directing but also due to the acting. Bruce Willis shows that he is a good actor and can also play a character without guns. Toni Collette is also good and warming as troubled mother but real discovery of the movie is of course Haley Joel Osment. He is more than just a child actor, he is a real actor! He really deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie and I wouldn't had mind him seeing winning it. Oh well, his hopefully his time will come, after all he is only just 16 now. The movie got nominated for 5 more Oscars including best picture and best director. The movie eventually went home empty handed, a shame because the movie deserved at least an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Already trademark M. Night Shyamalan element in a movie is the surprise ending. ""The Sixth Sense"" does have a good surprise ending, it's a kind of ending that makes you want to see the movie again after you finished watching it for the first time.

Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the picture is low-keyed, somewhat ambitious, but not very delicate, with plot-holes and moments where there seems to be no driving force behind the narrative; for such a deliberately-paced movie, Shyamalan doesn't show much grace, only technical finesse.

"ten_neon_hearts","3","5","11","16 December 2008"," My lovely friend Emma's review!
","This is my friend Emma's review!<br/><br/>'The film starts off with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) getting drunk as a celebration of Malcolm's honour plaque given to him by the Government/Council. After running upstairs, ready to jump into bed together, they hear a noise in the bathroom. It turns out a mental ex-patient of Malcolm's has broken in (""Vincent Gray""), and in the end of the scene Malcolm is shot by him, but the audience don't know yet that he is, in fact, dead.<br/><br/>The first plot hole my friend and I came across was the notes Malcolm has on Cole Sear, his new client. How did he get the notes? We don't know. As it turns out in the very end, Malcolm has been dead the entire time, so he finds out for himself then why nobody has spoken to him for such a long time (yet another plot hole, because you WOULD notice that). You can rule out the idea that 'Coles mother filled Malcolm in with all the details' because Malcolm is dead and nobody can see him. A ridiculous detail I found out was that Bruce Willis had to write with his right hand in this film (he is naturally left-handed) to hide the fact he is not wearing his wedding ring since his death in the first scene. <br/><br/>Plot hole number three comes up soon after, when we find Malcolm and Cole's mother sitting opposite one another in chairs in the Sear's resident lounge. I started to wonder; how did the very-dead-and-invisible Malcolm actually get into the house in the first place? Did he simply knock on the door and dart in as a confused Mrs Sear opens the door to an empty space? That, of course, would be ridiculous. So we are left wondering how the Hell he got in. Anyway, it is ""cleverly designed"" to make it look like Mrs Sear was speaking to Malcolm before Cole enters the house, returning home from school. Of course, when you figure out he's dead, you end up thinking how stupid that technique was because it was pointless and confusing, NOT a 'twist' in the plot. Later on in the film, a few scenes later, there is the scene where Malcolm is supposedly 'unravelling the secret' Cole has about his sixth sense, seeing dead people. The scene is where Malcolm is listening to a recording of himself and Vincent years ago in one of the counselling sessions. This scene soon gets on your nerves as all you can see is a confused Malcolm with a ridiculous expression on his face listening to what sounds like an out of tune radio. Yes, spooky, Shymalan. Apparently, from the ""information"" Malcolm gets from this event, he ""figures out"" that Cole has a similar condition as Vincent did. Diddy-Mao, Malcolm, we already figured that out for ourselves scenes ago! Now would be an opportune moment to mention that the actor that played Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is incredibly irritating throughout the film. He gives off that 'theatre-brat' attitude that makes you not want to give him any sympathy for his issues, but instead put him in a cage and throw away the key.<br/><br/>After a scene where a pathetic Malcolm tells Cole of his ""explanation"" regarding the ghosts Cole sees, that the ghosts are actually wanting to have Cole's help, they summon up this idea for Cole that he should indeed help the people he sees. The acting is, again, ridiculous and melodramatic as Cole sees more hanging dead people.<br/><br/>Plot hole number 5 occurs when Malcolm visits Cole in his school play. Why didn't anybody sit on him? He's not there, after all.<br/><br/>In the next scene or so, Malcolm returns to his home, where he finds his wife asleep on the couch with the couple's wedding video on in the background. As she sleeps, Anna's hand releases Malcolm's wedding ring, which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing. Ding, ding, ding! Plot hole number 6! A shocked Malcolm has only JUST realised he hasn't been wearing his wedding ring! Oh dear! What an atrocity! I think not, just plain stupid. He then attempts to open the cupboard door he attempted to open on more than one occasion during the film, and then realises he can't open it because Anna has blocked the door with boxes, as revealed by the camera as it falls back to show the boxes. Yet another unfulfilled, pointless, random scene. Wouldn't you notice the boxes before then? A confused and upset Malcolm then rushes upstairs to the bedroom and discovers his wound from the gunshot. Cue plot hole number 7; who in their right mind doesn't notice a gaping hole in their stomach for over a year? Malcolm really isn't on the ball is he? Anyway, he realises he's actually dead now and puts two and two together as to why his wife has been ignoring him. After a few flashbacks we realise Anna wasn't actually in a mood with Malcolm, she just never saw him! Oh the twists and turns of this film just get worse, don't they? Cheesefest. Malcolm has a conversation with Anna, as Cole told him to. He says he loves her and that she wasn't second best to his job. Oh, what a lovely ending. The screen then fades to black. Fin.<br/><br/>Another plot hole/random 'detail' I noticed was the amount of red props used in the film (Lynn's red nails, Cole's red sweater, the red balloon at the birthday party, etc). The camera makes a bee line for all these random red items but we never really find out why. According to Shymalan, it symbolised something the audience had to figure out. I didn't figure it out, it's just too out of place and stupid.'"
"lilextreme","9","2","3","26 June 2019"," Possibly 1 of the last great original films :(
","I am writing this review long long after this movie had been released so I will try to stick to my feelings at the time I watched it.
It definitely started a new & exciting trend in movies but it also made it more difficult for future movies to surprise(?) us as successfully.
However I really didn't enjoy this movie the first time I watched it and even watched it again to look for certain things that I may have missed. This is something I rarely do (re-watch).
It was a very good classic horror story that kept me entertained and I enjoyed watching till the end.
Almost all horror...etc.. movies nowadays have very disappointing endings,( and I use the term ""ending"" very very loosely)..
it's like they just decide to stop filming after realizing they didn't know how to conclude anything & basically wasted our time watching a story that went nowhere while spitting out the usual BS excuse "" we wanted to leave it up to you the user to decide what happens"" , which basically explains nothing.<br/><br/>I felt like the sixth sense left me with an extremely satisfying conclusions and The overwhelming excitement to discuss it with others. If you are one of the very, very few people who has not watched or heard of this movie, then first of all ...""WoW!!!"" You're lucky if you getting to watch it for the first time without any info about it & second, if you are planning to watch this soon, I suggest you do so without really reading too much about it or letting others who've already seen it, tell you much about it.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I really enjoyed the story, the entire unfolding, the acting and basically everything else. It did a great job of keeping me engaged and pretty much stuck to the story without adding unnecessary scenes for nothing more then shock value or filler.
It's definitely become a cult classic and my only regret is not being able to see it for the first time again....
I feel as though this was sadly one of the last decent movies in at least the last decade or so.
it's so obviously only about money now... instead of quality storytelling.
There are many extremely talented people out there who are MORE than capeable of creating amazing films, but most likely they'll never be given the chance to express their work Because Hollywood is too crowded for ""unknown"" & unproven talent..<br/><br/>So until them we will keep getting these generic scripts or consistent rewrites from the people with the ""big names"" that make money.

"rooprect","8","2","3","1 September 2014"," Even if someone spoiled the ending for you, it's still worth seeing
","There are over 2000 IMDb reviews for ""The Sixth Sense"" so I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said. But in case someone has already spoiled the ending for you (like some dumbbutt did for me and the entire office back in 1999, causing me to avoid this movie for 15 years), never fear... it's still VERY MUCH worth watching.<br/><br/>The cool twist is, of course, the main punch of this film. But it's the kind of film you have to watch twice. Once for the story and once for the poetry. So to all my fellow film lovers who happen to have friends & coworkers with big mouths, this film is still a real treat on a poetic & artistic level.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors who deserves the hype and popularity he gets, at least for this film (I haven't seen any of his others but soon will). Everything is meticulously planned, every camera movement, every shadow, every color and every editing cut, almost to the point of obsessive mania. In the DVD extras he and his crew explain why they did everything the way they did; for example they do a lot of long takes because their philosophy was that rapid cuts tend to disrupt the viewer's thought process. So instead of showing a dialogue between two people in a volley of closeup cuts, the scene is done with 1 camera filming them from the side, slowly, almost hypnotically moving between both of them as it gets closer over the course of perhaps 2 minutes.<br/><br/>I could go on for ages about such scenes, but you probably get the point. If you enjoy the classic directors known for their careful & deliberate approach to filmmaking, directors like Orson Welles (""Citizen Kane""), Otto Preminger (""The Man with the Golden Arm""), Kurosawa (""Seven Samurai"") or even the younger crop of great directors like Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"") and Alfonso Cuarón (""Children of Men""), you definitely have to check out this movie and other works of Shyamalan."

","The Sixth sense has been hailed by some as one of the greatest horror stories ever put on film. But I must disagree. I won't deny that I enjoyed the film, but to compare it to Rosemary's baby, Psycho, or The Omen... well, it just can't be done.<br/><br/>The Sixth sense revolves around a psychiatrist(Bruce Willis) who is asked to investigate a disturbed child named Cole(Haley Joel Osment). Cole has been having some odd behavior, and the reason why is that he is haunted by ghosts.<br/><br/>The Sixth sense, if you've never seen it, has a brilliant twist. Unfortunately, most people have probably blown it for those who haven't seen it. But at the time the twist was brilliant. Also, I loved the ending, and the overall message. And the film has got some chilling moments, and very good performances. Osment obviously steals the show, but Willis is strong too.<br/><br/>But you can't sit there and tell me that this film was Oscar worthy. There were plenty of films in 1999 that deserved it more than this. Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, Election, all great films. You could probably sit M. Night Shamylan down in a room and watch Magnolia and he would probably say it was a ton better. And thats because it was.<br/><br/>The Sixth sense is a good film, but its another Oscar nominee that just doesn't deserve it. Osment deserved a nomination, and Toni Collette, who was snubbed, would have deserved one too. But the rest is unnecessary. Good, but overrated.<br/><br/>B+"
"pfgpowell-1","6","2","3","7 March 2011"," Fair enough, but not the work of genius some claim
","I hate to be a party pooper, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The Sixth Sense is an entertaining film, better than some, not as good as others, but it is most certainly not the masterpiece many seem to make it out to be. (Nor, for that matter, is it as bad as many here suggest.) If anything it is an intriguing story, and not original at that - read The Third Policeman - which is realised in a somewhat perfunctory way by Shaymalan. If anything it could have been done better. When I was considering my view of the film, the word 'ponderous' occurred to me more than once, and I think that is about right. The Sixth Sense needed a more delicate touch and, well, it should have been spookier. Having said all that the young lad who portrays young Cole, the boy who can see the dead, give an outstanding performance, and for once an American director has successfully resisted the temptation to make a child more cloying than a mug of treacle. His mother also does well as a harassed single mother, and Bruce Willis shows that there is more to his ability than shooting guns and posing in sweaty T shirts. But I have to repeat: The Sixth Sense is great for a night in but not the earth-shattering Meisterwerk others claim it to be. If anything, there is any number of plot holes which become rather glaring once the film has finished and overall it doesn't quite stack up as it should. But what the hell: that would be serious is it came anyway close to being a work of genius. As it doesn't, those plot holes don't really matter."

Haley Joel Osmont was simply excellent in this movie. It is a shame that puberty really was not good on him but his performance was impressive and convincing as the boy with 'the sixth sense.'

Toni Collette was also very convincing as the mother who is left confused and suspicious of her son and his secret. All the other support cast are very good as well.

","""The Sixth Sense"" is a good movie but perhaps a little overrated. I believe that those who don't like it are in minority. Part of this explains its success.<br/><br/>The unfortunate reality is that this was the only Haley Joel Osment's successful movie. He made a reasonable number of very good movies and none of them was a success: ""Pay It Forward"", ""Edges of the Lord"" and ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"".<br/><br/>Ironically at first nobody didn't expect that ""The Sixth Sense"" was going to have half of this success. This means that, if it wasn't a success, then Haley Joel Osment wouldn't have had a single successful movie.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the movie itself. Sometimes this is classified as a terror movie, but for me this isn't really a terror film. This is a combination of supernatural, drama, tension, suspense, thriller and instrumental (but suspenseful) music, without the use of special effects. Its simplicity works out well. This motion picture is also emotional, funny at parts and only in brief moments there is some terror.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment plays a difficult role for a child, but with his incredible talent he steals the show. He was the first child actor ever nominated for Best Actor. Too bad he didn't win (not only for this, but also for his other movies I mentioned).<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in this. He is usually a very limited actor, but in this he's just as good as Haley. Plus, unlike his other films, Bruce plays a likable character here.<br/><br/>Aside some absolutely unnecessary scenes, this movie is generally good. One of the best parts is when Cole (Haley Joel Osment) finally reveals his secret to Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). That part is breathtaking, highly emotional and intense. Cole's facial expressions say all and some of the movie's best quotes can be heard in this sequence.<br/><br/>The idea of this movie inspired the TV series ""Ghost Whisperer"" which stars Jennifer Love Hewitt."

","This was the first of M. Night Shyamalan's films I'd seen. I've now seen all of his five majors, and this is still a great one. Of course, I'd heard the line ""I see dead people"" previously, but hadn't known where it came from. Of course, the twist at the end *SPOILER*(with Crow being dead)*SPOILER END* is one of the most startling revelations a movie has shown me plot-wise, and I know only maybe two people who predicted it would happen (one of which is my mother.) A really great movie, highly suggested for Thriller lovers and who are new to Shyamalan's work. If you don't like gore, not to worry! Hardly any gore here. P.S. Look for the color Red!"

","Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe is confronted one night by his former patient Vincent Gray who he failed to help. After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can't stop thinking about it. A few months later he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear, who has many of the same problems Vincent had. Crowe sees a chance to redeem himself, but doubts his ability to reach the boy, particularly when Cole claims to see ghosts who don't know they're dead.<br/><br/>Right off, I'll say this is one of the best films ever. It currently ranks #3 for M. Night's films. I love this movie because it's a really good ghost story and has a thought-provoking plot.<br/><br/>Yeah, this film was famous so I already knew the ending before it even happened but that didn't distract me from watching the movie. Throughout the movie is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The acting by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette were all fantastic and some like Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg were all great, too.<br/><br/>If you want an intelligent ghost movie with some scares and twists and turns, this is the movie for you. It's not just a plain old stupid scary movie. It has a story and great acting."

","The Sixth Sense was deservedly a surprising Hollywood sensation. It is of course remembered for its amazing and shocking ending. I can tell you though, there is much more to this film than just the ending.<br/><br/>People who say The Sixth Sense is rubbish because the ending is obvious and they figured it out are just being stupid and they don't know what they are talking about. I have watched films before knowing the ending, and have still enjoyed them as much as anyone. The ending is there for you to see throughout the film, but it is still hard to figure out - a bit like the twist in Fight Club. Even without the great ending though, this film would still be excellent. Bruce Willis has proved once again that he has many more strings to his bow than just action hero John McClane that made him famous, as he puts in a wonderful performance as a doctor haunted by his past. The script and direction by M. Night Shyamalan is also very good. Despite these two great performances though, the stand out has to be Haley Joel Osment as the disturbed young boy. He is really freaky, and he really captures how scared his character would probably be in real life.<br/><br/>The huge twist ending does divert attention from the rest of the film, but the rest of the film should not be forgotten. If you haven't watched this yet, you will not just be sat there waiting for the ending, the whole storyline is a compelling and disturbing drama. It is a film to watch more than once, as the ending does fit in perfectly with the storyline before it. The ending of Unbreakable is about as shocking, but I don't think Shyamalan will ever make another film as good as this."

","I'd be the first to tell you that I avoid thriller or any movie that even smacks of suspense. I don't handle it well and I'm not particularly fond of blood and gore. (I almost passed out when the doctor needed a blood sample.) It's not that I don't appreciate a good suspenseful movie, but current movie tend to be more than I can handle. But The Sixth Sense is a movie that kept the suspense and didn't have the gore. I was riveted from the moment it started. Bruce Willis was great as the doctor and the rest of the cast was outstanding as well. However, what makes the movie great were the writing and the direction. The story keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat. I don't believe in esp or ghosts, but the writing made the concepts seem realistic and believable. There are few red herrings and the surprise at the end of the movie really was a surprise. The direction of the movie probably was the strongest point. The movie is quiet with few loud, screeching moments  like many horror movies, such as Halloween or any of the many Friday the 13th flicks  which makes it even more suspenseful. This is a must see for any suspense fan."
"slokes","9","2","3","8 February 2007"," Some Twists And Stuff
","""The Sixth Sense"" is the first horror film I know of that also works as a tear-jerker. A ""creepy weepy,"" you might even call it; the darnedest thing about that combination being how well it plays here.<br/><br/>Child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is trying to recover his professional equilibrium after one of his most traumatic cases came to a fatal end. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy who struggles with his peers, is called a ""freak,"" and draws horrible images until he is called into a meeting about it. Now he just draws pictures of rainbows, not because his heart's in it, but because ""they don't have meetings about rainbows."" Underneath the surface, it's anything but rainbows for poor Cole.<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" has become a prisoner of its popularity the same way ""Titanic"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" have, marked for ridicule by those who think themselves better than the hoi polloi who made it such a hit. Even people who haven't seen ""Sixth Sense"" know its catchphrases and storyline, and with that familiarity comes contempt, especially as its director, M. Night Shyamalan, has struggled in recent years to repeat his success. In such an atmosphere, it's easy to overlook that the one thing that makes ""Sixth Sense"" so popular is that it's so incredibly good.<br/><br/>The art of storytelling is at the heart of the film, the way it quietly unfolds at its own pace, pulling you in with eerie moments and occasional shocks to a place that gets deeper as you get closer. Cole explains at one point to Dr. Crowe that the trick to a good story is that it have ""some twists and stuff."" People who downgrade ""The Sixth Sense"" do so on the basis of the twists, which was what got the film so talked about in the first place. But it's the other ""stuff"" that makes ""Sixth Sense"" so lasting and compelling for its fans.<br/><br/>Take it from me: I watched ""Sixth Sense"" for the first time just over a year ago. By then its much ballyhooed ""secret"" was out of the bag for me, just as it probably is for you even if you haven't yet seen this film. The film took me for a ride anyway, because of Shyamalan's soft-yet-penetrating eye; incredible acting led by Osment, Willis, and Toni Collette as Cole's mom; and its sentimental-yet-spooky atmosphere.<br/><br/>Every scene is shot with a certain style that makes it compelling not just as horror but as a slice of life, and this constant balance makes the film such a marvel. Even as it slips out of everyday reality into the utterly fantastic, it does so in a way you never notice your feet leaving the ground. Moments of fright are alleviated with humor and warmth.<br/><br/>Something else needs to be said of ""Sixth Sense,"" that despite its horror theme it's a positive, inspirational film, one that on its own terms gives ""Passion Of The Christ"" a run for its money in terms of connecting to the deepest feelings of many of its viewers.<br/><br/>Yes, Shyamalan does gild the lily too much at times, tying up things that don't need tying up, and you can feel your heartstrings being tugged at a little too much at points. There may be a couple of minor plot holes visible on a second viewing. But still, at the very least the end result is one terrific piece of entertainment, and probably very much more."

It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.<br/><br/>You don't need to go and see this film again to realize why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.<br/><br/>It is a near perfect 8 out of 10."

","The story takes place in modern day America where a child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is looking for redemption for a former patient's suicide. He finds a young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and along comes a bonding relationship; a man torn and broken and a collapsing marriage, and a boy terrified to wake up in the morning and classed as a freak by his peers. <br/><br/>Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan, it's clear that everyone on the set has worked extremely hard to make this movie what it is. But to have written such an elaborate and well thought out story is quite remarkable also.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment delivers an astonishing performance for such a young actor, it's clear that he has a bright future ahead of him. It also refreshing to see Bruce Willis take a different role not the whole stereotypical Hollywood action film hero. He actually keeps his shirt on and he's not wielding some kind of firearm nor does he have a woman leaning on his chest saying how much she loves him. In this film he's really shown that he can do so much more than take out a gang of mobsters and be the hero of the day, in this story the hero takes a completely different role.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to talk about the film without saying anything to spoil it but as Malcolm and Cole finally start to connect, Cole wants to tell Malcolm a secret and he says, ""I can see dead people."" Probably one of the most chilling and memorable lines in movie history it also had a big effect on me to see now what the child was going through. All these years of suffering and torment, and now he's finally being able to talk to someone about it.<br/><br/>Toni Collette also delivers a fantastic performance as a regular 'super' mum; her husband has passed away and she is now working two jobs, constantly trying to protect her child. In one particularly well acted piece of drama Cole is unwell and faints; she takes him to the hospital and is accused of hurting her child as markings were found on his back. As she looks away towards Malcolm in disgust a tear falls from her eyes, But the unexplained issue is what gave Cole the scratches, a group of children could not have given him that. Nor can his mother understand why was he screaming, it just constantly builds up to the film's climatic and dramatic ending.<br/><br/>Another well-acted minor role was Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg). He was only on screen for about three or four minutes but you could see all the emotion and drama that was put into that short while on screen. But the minute he appeared there was a lot of eeriness and feelings of despair, and he was a completely unpredictable character.<br/><br/>As the plot gets deeper the actors immerse themselves in the characters and really start to show their emotions, this is cleverly portrayed by several tear-jerking moments. Credit to Willis and Osment; they really make it the great film it is but my greatest amount of praise would have to be awarded to Shyamalan as for coming up and directing such a spectacular film nearly flawless in every aspect. I think it's clear that The Sixth Sense is one of the genre defining movies of the 20th century. <br/><br/>8/10. A genre defining thriller, really one of the must see movies, all I can do is praise this film, its blockbuster genius."

","It isn't often a new director rises so quickly to the top of the ""A"" list with only a handful of films. But M. Night Shyamalan does exactly that with the surprise hit, The Sixth Sense. The tale is of a popular, but egotistic doctor (Bruce Willis) who sincerely believes in his award winning psychotherapeutic abilities and looks forward to a prosperous career with the mentally ill. But failing to secure a proper treatment for a suicidal patient, the doctor finds himself with yet another troubled, but far more mysterious boy (Halley Joel Osment) who possesses the power to communicate with the afterlife. Together they discover their own fears and a need for mutual understanding and trust. The film is a frightful combination of sights, sounds and illusionary symbols which creates terror and suspense with each new scene. The Director, like other famous movie artists, makes a cameo appearance and it up to the viewer to locate him during the unfolding drama. Fancible enough to be hauntingly interesting, the film is also a masterful canvas of photographic magic. Audiences everywhere will agree, this film will become a classic for the director and it's stars. ****"

And it's not until the end of the film - after all the discussions with the boy - that he realises his wife isn't speaking to him. Mmm. Bit like the 'here it comes' ending to the Village. There's no major benefit building a whole film round the last five minutes and when the audience is lied to then it's even more unforgivable. Very few films build a case for spending 2 hours setting up the punchline - Usual Suspects springs to mind - but Sixth Sense isn't one of them. A cheap trick in a pretty dress."

","'The Sixth Sense' is a horror film about a young boy who has the power to see the ghosts of people who have passed away. The boy gets help from a psychologist and tries to learn how to fit in and know a normal life. The film succeeds in playing the horror as well as cinematography and a plot that makes the audience think. Most of the horror in the film is portrayed in a way that gets the imagination to work and plays on suspense. The plot is engaging and it also makes the audience think. However, I thought that it was predictable and knew what was happening before the end of the film. The performances are done well, and this film does have several strong points, but as a film overall, I think that it was average."

","Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a Philadelphia psychiatrist meeting with Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a boy who can - OK, I'll say it this one last time - see dead people. While too many horror flicks have relied on gore, this one relies on the subconscious, and other things that we don't realize. And of course, there's the ending. I literally did not see that coming, although there were a number of clues throughout the movie. All that I can say is, you are going to have your mind blown. M. Night Shyamalan truly created an impressive piece of cinema history here, and of his later movies, only ""Unbreakable"" came close to equalling this one's quality.<br/><br/>On another note, I think that it was appropriate that ""The Sixth Sense"" came out in 1999, when I was 15. It was named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the many movies that year that revolutionized the movie industry (along with ""Election"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Being John Malkovich""). Similarly, in 1967, when my parents were 15, movies such as ""In the Heat of the Night"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Graduate"" - all revolutionizing the movie industry - were released.

Night Shyamalan's breakout feature THE SIXTH SENSE plays much better on TV than it ever did in theaters. With its slow tempo and stately visuals, the movie takes a mature approach to its supernatural subject matter, revealing Osment's ultra-creepy 'secret' in piecemeal fashion, one scare at a time. Former tough guy Willis plays a vulnerable figure whose bond with Osment provides a level of stability absent from his personal life - devastated by an incident in the film's opening sequence, Willis' wife (Olivia Williams) seems to be drifting into a relationship with a young family friend (Glenn Fitzgerald) - and while Osment is the primary focus of Shyamalan's screenplay, it's Willis who holds the material together. Some viewers may be distracted by the film's deliberate pacing, while others will be affected by the gradual accumulation of creepy details, spiked by a couple of really good jolts. The much-lauded twist ending might have been more effective had it not been mentioned in EVERY SINGLE REVIEW (including this one!), making it possible for many people to guess the 'surprise' long before Shyamalan reveals his hand. Australian actress Toni Collette is superb as Osment's harried - but deeply loving - mom, and there are cameo appearances by Shyamalan himself and an unrecognisable Donnie Wahlberg (BAND OF BROTHERS)."

You believe every second of Toni Collette's brilliant performance as Cole's mother, a woman pushed to her limits of worry and grief.

Don't let its categorization by some as a horror movie scare you away...it isn't a horror movie.  It's a drama, and one of the greatest ones of all at that."
"Special-K88","Null","2","3","7 March 2002"," great piece of work that sets a new standard for the genre
","Tense, creepy thriller about a renowned child psychologist (Willis) whose devotion to his work has overtaken his personal life and put him at odds with his neglected wife. He's also in the midst of his most difficult case yet in trying to get through to a troubled, introverted young boy (an exceptional Osment) who lives in fear and trauma of his uncanny ability to see the dead. One of the most effective thrillers of its time: gripping, suspenseful, flawlessly performed, and extremely well-crafted, with sure-handed direction that allows for plenty of spooky, spine-chilling moments on its way to a startling and awe-inspiring finale. A genuinely scary thriller that actually pays off the way it should. ***Â½"

I'm so glad that I'm not a genius like some folks who are so gifted with super intellect that they figured the story out half way through.

","To me this film ranks right up there with The Innocents as one of the very best ghost stories ever made. The surprise ending really IS a surprise, and works even better on multiple viewings. I think that this film really is about the profound human need for communication, connection, and most of all for compassion. The Sixth Sense transcends its genre, as do most classics, and I do think that this one is going to a classic. Bruce Willis proves once again that he can act, despite what his detractors would have us believe. Haley Joel Osment-- in one of the truly great child performances-- is wonderful. Bravo! This film should have won the Oscar instead of American Beauty."

"DerekC","10","2","3","25 February 2001"," About the supposed plot holes...
","First off, I think this is a great movie, and my opinion of it hasn't diminished with multiple viewings.  It's a shame Osment only nabbed a Best Supporting nod; whatever you thought of his performance here -- and the praise seems pretty unanimous -- he certainly carried enough of the movie to be considered in the Best Actor category.<br/><br/>Now, as for all these complaints about the supposed plot/logic holes in the movie...<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>I can't believe how many comments here have echoed the same complaint: ""How could Malcolm not know he was dead?  Didn't he ever try to eat / talk to his wife / change his clothes / go the bathroom / etc?"".  I thought it was implicitly understood that Malcolm saw whatever he wanted/needed to see, in order to maintain the illusion of his former life.  Whether he subconsciously knew the truth, I don't know, but it's the only explanation for how he could have ignored the above issues.  In fact, the end montage showed an example of this, when Malcolm finally noticed the desk blocking the basement door (the same basement he'd been coming and going from every day).<br/><br/>Sure, it's a catch-all solution, but I don't think it's a cop-out; it even makes sense within the context of the story.  Otherwise, as everyone's pointed out, how could he *not* know he was dead?  He'd have realized something was wrong the first time he tried to talk to anyone, or touch anything.<br/><br/>And as for being able to break the window that one time... I thought the ghosts all had limited physical ability when they were under stress? Isn't that how Cole got his scratches and bruises?"

The whole thing with the color red seems very cheap and obvious.<br/><br/>The best scene was the 'communication' scene between Osment and Collette in the car.

After it ends, you just walk your way out of the theatre towards your house, talking about the quality of the burgers you had before the movie, or what happened earlier at your job, or what are your plans for tomorrow.

","It is hard for me to really comment on this film without talking about its ending (I won't). For about an hour and a half, this is a spectacular movie, well-acted, with excellent script and dialogue, and moving at a good pace. I think it's something of a cross between film noir and thriller, and it has that eerie ""Silence of the Lambs"" feel to it (though much tamer).<br/><br/>This movie lasts one scene too long. I heard someone remark once that some movies ""are great or awful depending on the ending"". The very last scene in this film is absolutely preposterous; instead of wrapping up the story neatly, with maybe a tiny plot hole, the last two or three minutes brought to mind at least 20 or 30 gaping plot holes immediately. I have a friend who told me he could guess the film's ""secret"" thirty minutes in. Things like that usually don't surprise me, but this was so unbelievably, outrageously stupid I had no idea. I felt like screaming at the screen and demanding my hour and a half back based on that scene alone.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't consider this movie among the worst I've ever seen is because it is quite good for awhile. Haley Joel Osment is excellent, and the only good reason to see this movie. Other than that, I can't believe this thing was as popular as it was. The ending left me feeling so cheated, I wanted to break the screen in two."

Spooks run across the screen, no doubt thrilling all the thirteen-year-olds in the theater.  And at the end, our hero was dead all along.  Which could certainly have fooled his wife.<br/><br/>Seven cents is too much to pay to see the Sixth Sense."

I watched the DVD (I, surprisingly, had not heard about the ending) and cannot understand the uproar and acclaim this movie has gotten. I found myself bored with the plot and the characters most of the way through and the ending, though somewhat surprising, didn't make up for an overall average film. I kept waiting for the plot to get interesting to justify all of the acclaim and it just never happened.<br/><br/> Solid acting, average script and a surprising ending do not make a classic, this was definitely not one of the top 5 movies of '99 (how this was nominated and not Magnolia is beyond me) and certainly not in the top 20 of all time (as IMDB voting would suggest.)"

I did like the ending quite a bit, and the acting was solid throughout, but in general, the film was uninteresting and rarely entertaining.  That's not to say that I was frequently bored throughout, but I was generally indifferent to the characters and to the on-screen happenings.  It's an adequate time killer, but not much more."

Or perhaps, just perhaps, there really wasn't as much that was special, different, or outstanding in this movie to validify all the acclaim it has garnered.  It was boring in places, overly drawn out throughout, and had no outstanding performances by any of the actors.

When I saw the ending, I burst into tears.<br/><br/>Malcolm is a child psychologist. One day, he and his wife celebrated the social achievements they had just achieved. Then he met a patient who was ten years ago and asked him why he gave up treatment. Then he shot the doctor in the abdomen. Afterwards, the gunman himself killed himself with ammunition.<br/><br/>A year later, Dr. Malcolm met Cole, a young patient with similar symptoms. Lonely and indifferent, it is always considered a freak by others. With the loss of the young patient in mind, the doctor decided to work hard to help the boy and make up for his inner regrets.<br/><br/>At first boy Cole resisted uncooperative, but slowly the interaction between the two increased. Cole realized that the doctor really wanted to help him, and finally opened his heart, telling him that he had a secret and could see the dead anytime, anywhere. ghost.<br/><br/>At first, Malcolm thought that this was a fantasy caused by mental illness, and felt that he could not give Cole professional treatment. Later, he had thought of giving up on Cole's treatment because his wife was more and more alienated from him, but recalled to the patient He treated the tape, and realized that Cole said it seemed true. So firmly continue to accompany and help Cole. And recommended Cole to help those ghosts. As Cole did, he also gained new confidence and calmness.<br/><br/>The ending is not here spoiler, it is really exquisite design. Immediately recalled the ending of ""Passenger"" starring Anne Hathaway.<br/><br/>I have a lot of thoughts about watching movies.
To believe in children, you should not question them just because their perspective is different from that of adults.
To believe in love, you think that the other party is alienated, but you have forgotten your giving.
Choose bravery, even if the other party makes you uncomfortable, you must listen hard, give it the best kindness, and ultimately gain your own inner peace and strength.
To choose goodness and help others is to fulfill yourself."

And while I was sceptical as child actors can vary substantially, I am happy to report the actor does a excellent job. In fact every one of the actors does a good job at portraying their characters. The story itself is quite good and the main twist is a welcomed surprise although a bit easy to guess once you're about 60% through the film.

"johngoodwin-53009","9","1","1","23 September 2019"," An introspective film with breathtaking twist
","The sixth sense put me on a rollercoaster ride. I was drawn into the story immediately with the scene where Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe is shot in his home by a child he just could not help. The theme of the film is two central characters finding out about themselves. The acting by Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear was inspiring especially for such a young talent at the time. The guilt that Crowe feels as he is unable to help his former patient Vincent drives him to give Cole his utmost effort and attention. The angles the cinematographer uses to bring us into the point of view of each character is flawless and draws the viewer in without even realizing it. It takes Cole a while to open up to Crowe because he seems to be embarrassed to say what is wrong with him. Once he finally does tell Malcolm what is wrong, which happens to be the fact that Cole sees ""dead people"" his fear is almost true as Malcolm does not believe him at first and believes he is hallucinating and may be delusional. Eventually after listening to Cole on tape over and over again he happens to hear a voice an the background which leads him to believe Cole. Malcolm then recommends that Cole should try to use his ability to try and understand why the dead people are coming to him. As Cole speaks to the spirits, he is finding out how they passed away. One for instance leads him to a gun then reveals a gunshot wound to the back of his head. Then a girl shows up in Cole's room. He goes to the girl's house during her funeral and finds a video tape which he gives to the girl's father. The father then watches the tape and finds out that it is his wife who is poisoning the children and killing them, not that a naturally acquired sickness is taking them. Once Cole feels good about his ability while riding in his car, he finally decides to open up about what is going on with him to his mother. His mother does not believe her son until he tells her a story about a dance he heard from his grandmother that would be impossible for Cole to know otherwise. After feeling better and actually healed by Malcolm Crowe, Cole advises him to talk to his wife while she is sleeping. It is during this talk that Malcolm realizes that he actually died during the confrontation with Vincent. This realization along with Cole's newfound freedom and ability to fit in in school ties up the theme of the film."

My parents were extremely smart, knowing what a scaredy-cat kid I was, and didn't let me watch it until I was sixteen. I still screamed at the top of my lungs and ran out of the room. It's not the most upsetting movie I've seen, but it was at that point in my life.<br/><br/>Young Haley Joel Osment, endearing himself into the hearts of every audience member around the world, is having a problem. He's struggling against the normal childhood bullies and getting along with his single mom, Toni Collette, but he also sees dead people. Sometimes they just scare the pants off him with their wounds, and sometimes they talk to him. Child psychologist Bruce Willis tries to help Haley through this difficult time, and the two bond. Since this movie is obviously a vehicle for Haley's incredible acting chops-although, you have to wonder why his parents let him act in such emotionally damaging roles-it's quite a feat that Bruce is able to shine as well. In the immortal scene when Haley tells him, ""I see dead people,"" both actors show off their chops. It's not just Haley's scene, because Bruce has to react to him with understanding, compassion, and trust.<br/><br/>If you can handle it, this movie really is a classic that needs to be watched. I couldn't handle it, so I say to my fellow squeamish viewers, if you don't like the sight of blood, you're not going to like this movie. And whatever you do, if you've never seen it, don't talk about the movie with anyone or watch the movie 50 First Dates, as a critical plot point will get spoiled for you.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Even Bruce Willis, in a very reserved role, pondering and silently observing, does a remarkably good job bringing a sense of the character's reality to the screen.<br/><br/>Although the cast is small and upon re-watching, the film feels anemic at times, it is only when you know the story and are watching for it that you sense that we aren't seeing reality all of the time. I place the credit for that feat on the actors for creating expressions of these characters that would not allow you to think of them as anything except real people who were captivatingly interesting.<br/><br/>The Storytelling is, of course, unique, or it was. Today, people may make jokes about the 'Shyamalan Twist' but at the time, it was a shock to end the film with a scene that made you rethink everything that had happened in the whole movie. To set everything into the story so carefully and precisely that people didn't see it coming was a feat, but to do it in such a way that you watch it a second time and think 'How did I not know? It hardly feels like he's trying to hide it,' is simply mind blowing to me."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that ""The Sixth Sense"" celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. I remember thinking to myself when I first saw it 20 years ago that it was an instant classic. And now today, it still is. I don't know what else I could possibly say that hasn't already been said about his wonderful movie after all this time and after all the reviews. Since it is indeed a well known classic film, there aren't too many who still don't know what its twist, surprise ending is. However, being as such, I wouldn't want to ruin anything for that one person out there who hasn't seen it by giving it away in just a few paragraphs.<br/><br/>What I will say is this. There are few films like it - and few that can or will shell shock you like ""The Sixth Sense"" does. Haley Joel Osment was a find and perfectly cast as the troubled little boy who ""can see dead people"". For this movie to work, his perfomance had to be convincing. Well, not only was it convincing, it became a landmark performance that people still talk about today. The only other child actor that wowed me as much as Osment did in this one, was Kirsten Dunst in ""Interview With The Vampire"". In my personal opinion, those two performances are the single best by child actors in the history of movie making.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis also scores here. And, of course, it all came from the mind of M. Night Shyamalan - who forever made it on to the map of special directors with this movie. I have seen it numerous times - it is very re-watchable and just as enjoyable as the first viewing. Maybe the initial surprise and shock isn't there, but I love it all the same.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. It is perfectly made. One for the ages. If for some reason, you have not yet seen this movie, and you do not know the surprise waiting for you, do not read anything else about it. Put on the popcorn, turn the lights down low and curl up on your couch - and enjoy one of the best movies to ever be shown."
"aciessi","7","1","1","14 January 2019"," Spine-Tingling
","""I see dead people""<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's first and most successful hour of his cinematic career was The Sixth Sense. A film that accomplishes, if nothing else, pure spookiness. Take any child, and give them supernatural abilities, and you've got a damn good recipe of freaking people out. Haley Joel Osment was an exceptionally great, mature actor for his age, which is what made this role even better. He compliments well with a quiet and calculative Bruce Willis. It's a fascinating story worthy of a Twilight Zone episode. But I don't believe that this is the best film of Shyamalan's catalogue. On more than one occasion during the span of the film, I noticed some of the dreaded trips of Shyamalan films that proved to be problematic later on in his career. I know, some of you out there love this movie, but go back and look closely. They are all still there. The ""twist"" of this film, suffice to say has been spoiled for me years ago. But even if it wasn't, I would NEVER have not seen it coming from the very beginning. That scene with Donnie Wahlberg as the opener is way too jarring and bizarre for it not to have meant something later on."
"MovieManChuck","10","1","1","23 July 2018"," A perfect suspense thriller and a force to be reckoned with...
","4/4 ESSENTIAL<br/><br/>If you've talked with anyone who's anyone about The Sixth Sense, chances are you've heard ""I see dead people"". I encourage people who have not viewed he film to walk in to their first viewing as blind as possible, because the less you know the better. If you're farmiliar with M. Night Shyamalan's work, you'll know that he's famous for a twist at the end of his movies. This is not only Shyamalan's best twist, but one of my favorite thrillers, and a modern classic.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is not a movie that is characterized by constant jump-scares and over-the-top violence, but instead it is a very smart, well preformed, and well directed movie. It slowly reveals new information over the course of the movie, and the suspense is waiting for the next answer. However, the two main characters (played by Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis) are always on the same phase of he journey as you are, providing a more genuine emotion to their preformances. It is a very well-constructed, well-orchestrated film and never gives way to it's own complex plot.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Osment is able to play the very troubled kid, Cole, alive with raw fear. To capture such a mature preformance out of a child his age is truly incredible. Willis gives a very earnest preformance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe as well, and it'll be hard or forget as well... I was genuinely surprised at how convincing both the leads and the supporting cast was. It doesn't get more authentic than this.<br/><br/>The instant success of this movie prompted Shyamalan to churn out more movies made in its image. Next was Unbreakable, a fantastic movie, and quite possibly an equal to The Sixth Sense. In 2002 came Signs, which was a great drama but little for suspense. In 2004, Shyamalan returned again with his signature ""plot twist"" with The Village, which fails to impress me. There is no doubt that Shyamalan hit hard with this movie, as he has been trying desperately to re-create the amazing experience found here. It just goes to show a formula is only good for so long, and he nails it in The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan has since been branded as a one-trick pony. While I disagree, I can understand those who think that. His films are similar... some are great, others aren't all that good. Even if it's true, The Sixth Sense is a pretty amazing trick and undoubtedly the movie that started it all for Shyamalan."
"shevaunhodge","10","1","1","4 July 2018"," Very clever film
","This film is very different and gives you a spooky ,but unusual feeling all the way through.. The film grips you the whole way through because the story is so interesting, i mean who wouldn't want to know what it would be like to see the dead? 
 The acting is superb especially by Haley Joal Osment who plays Cole Sear. Such amazing acting from someone so young. Fantastic acting, as predicted from Bruce Willis, who plays doctor Malcolm Crowe, and also from Toni collette Lynn sear. 
The story grips you and as the story unfolds, it surprises you quite few times with a lot of moments that leave in in shock. 
The most shocking part of the film is the ending and I don't know anyone that saw it coming. It is defiantly a massive twist that know one would ever guess. There are clues of in the film leading up to the twist, but they are not something most people would spot. The clues are shown in the film, and it is a moment when you say to yourself ""oh I get it now"". 
This film is still enjoyable even if you know the ending so i would watch it anyway, but obviously it is more of a shock if you do not know."
"nadeeshantennage","9","1","1","2 July 2018"," Kinda made me feel like maybe 'the others (2001)' adapted this concept of Shyamalan's mastery.
","If you are ready and up for a supernatural horror film which would keep you at the edge of your seat all the way through the running time with boosted and unnecessarily frequent jump scares, 'The sixth sense' wouldn't serve you right.
But instead if you are looking for an intelligent adaptation of supernatural elements about the 'dead' this is a must watch for you.
The film comes to life majorly because of the incredible performance by Joel Osment as Cole sear whose fear seasoned with anguish is deeply reflected through his eyes almost everytime he's on the screen which lets us understand his psychological fear in a more personal sense.
Bruce Willis who plays Malcolm Crowe gets an incredible standing out kinda twist in the climax of his character's arch which is the turning point and the big exposing scenario of the supernatural concept which is adapted in the film.
Even in her small role as Cole's mother Toni Collette shines with a emotionally boosted performance which inflicts the pain of a conflicted and stressed out single mother to the viewers.
The film which maintains its grip by keeping viewers invested with a good momentum of a few scares and thrilling sequences climaxes with an unforgettable and an unpredictable climax which would remind many of the horror genre lovers of the 'the Others (2001)' climax.
do not miss this intelligently written, directed and acted masterpiece."

"sassonlonner","9","1","1","2 May 2018"," Shyamalan's Best
","The Sixth Sense without a doubt is the best work of M. Night Shyamalan I have ever seen (I haven't seen all of his movies for a reason). The Sixth Sense is my second favorite horror movie I have ever seen, following Kubrick's The Shining. Although I do believe The Sixth Sense is the most frightening horror film I have ever seen, making me jump even after seeing it a handful of times. The movie isn't exactly a jumpscare kind of movie, but I think it has some of the most brilliant jumpscares I have ever seen. My favorite being while Cole stands in the bathroom in the middle of the night, and we see the lower body of a woman abruptly walk past the doorway when we were under the impression he was alone. Also, the scene where he hides from the young girl is terrifying, actually making me think of the young girls from The Shining.<br/><br/> Of course, the best part of the movie indeed is the ending. The plot twist of this film is truly up there with some of the most brilliant plot twists of all time like those from Hitchcock in Vertigo and Psycho. Watching the film a second time is truly crucial for this film, because Shyamalan is so good at covering up the ending, you totally will miss every single clue you are given, despite the clues being EVERYWHERE. Malcolm never once talks to any other person the entire film other than Cole. As much as you may convince yourself he was talking with his wife, think again, because every time he approached him, she did not say a word to him. She mumbles a word or two under her breath a few times, but these words are not directed towards anyone. On top of that, Cole numerous times describes the traits he has learned about ghosts in his time seeing them, and his descriptions so perfectly describe Malcolm's character. The movie truly does bring one of the most brilliant plot twists ever, but unfortunately Shyamalan hasn't brought us much more since."
"lilliehardwick","10","1","1","8 April 2018"," This is a thrilling story from start to finish.
","This is a thrilling story from start to finish. Willis effortlessly leads us to believe he is still alive and living his life. Olivia Williams plays the perfect part of the grieving wife. It takes us a long time to realise that she is grieving her husband and not the relationship they used to have. Haley Osment plays an outstanding part as we genuinely feel scared for him and his power. 
Toni Collette, too, should be credited as she gives such a realistic reaction to her son and his behaviour. We see her struggle to believe her son's behaviour as well as trying to protect him from others. 
The best part of the film has to be where Cole and his mother go to a party with some children who are unkind to him. They lock him in a closet where Cole encounters a frantic spirit who, like him, is desperate to get out. Even when he is released from this small space we do not feel at ease because we know he cannot escape these spirits. 
There are no scenes that disappoint in this film."

"hockeynomnom","9","1","1","17 March 2018"," All senses felt...
","This film was a remarkable way to end the millennium and provided sight to what was on the horizon for director M. Night Shyamalan. As a fan of psychological horror films that provide an unforeseen twist at the end, The Sixth Sense provided all the feels that I look for in this type of script. The first 5 minutes or so of this movie gave a pivotal scene where Malcolm was wounded by a former psychologist patient that won't have much importance on the film until we're fast approaching the credits. Soon after Malcolm is shot we meet eight year old Cole who is played by Haley Joel Osment as a new patient to Dr. Malcolm Crowe we can tell Cole is different than other children his age. We see Cole walk fast through the streets of Philadelphia straight into a quiet church where Malcolm observes then follows Cole for their first scene together. At this time no one is imagining that we are seeing Bruce Willis as a ghost, but as a human having an introduction to a new patient. <br/><br/>As we move further into the film we really start to see where the theme was headed not only for the film, but also a number of characters. In my opinion the theme was certainly showcasing unfinished business or righting a wrong. We can see that Malcolm really has remorse and heartache where he couldn't help save his former patient Vincent Gray and I felt that taking on new patient Cole was a way to heal that pain. Once Cole reveals that he can see the dead walking around not knowing they're dead, we start to see new images of characters in limbo with unfinished business where Cole can be the messenger if he has the courage.<br/><br/>Once we see what Cole has the capability of, we start to see the heartache but also the gift where he can help the dead. Cole was able to help a little girl who ultimately was murdered by her mother through poisoning and was found out with Cole's assistance of delivering a VHS tape to the young girl's father. This scene was heartbreaking and really made you feel pain when it focused on the motif with the color red, but his scene was also very joyous when this woman was found out for an unexplained act. This scene showed me that Cole was a helper with his gift and we soon realized for the previous hour that he was also helping a ghost named Malcolm.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys psychological films with a major twist at the end such as another film by M. Night Shyamalan Unbreakable. In closing this film is still one of my favorites even after being released almost 19 years ago and I certainly hope they have a 20th anniversary showing at my local theater."

","The Sixth sense is a movie written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis as a child psychologist named Malcom and also stars Haley Joel Osment as Cole, a boy who sees dead people. The ending is one of the best twists I have seen because not only do you not expect it but it gives you a reason to watch it again and the second time you view it the way you view the movie is totally different and I gotta commend Shyamalan for that. I have not seen every single one of Bruce Willis's films but from what i have seen this is his best performence yet and Haley Joel Osment is also really good, not just for his age but in general he is fantastic. This movie also plays with your mind a bit if you don't know the twist and that is just genius writing. Overall this is a great movie that is suspenseful and clever but it isn't without its flaws however. Since Bruce Willis's character Malcolm is a ghost how does he know that Cole was at the hospital? He was not there when Cole passed out and he has no one contact with to know because no one besides Cole can see him and talk to him so that is a head scratcher to me. Despite that I highly recommend you check this movie out"
"gordon-69874","8","1","1","14 March 2018"," Social Problems, Fear and Human Nature
","The film The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) is a story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy with a supernatural ability to see the dead. This ability, or sense, has been haunting him since birth causing him social insecurities to communicate with those around him for fear of being an outcast. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a psychologist trying to understand Cole situation and help him. The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) confronts social problems of those who are deemed different from what society considers 'normal', encountering the fear of the unknown and truths of human nature set aside individual desires to help those in need.
 Multiple times in the film The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) Cole is referred as a freak by the kids in his school. He is a child that keeps to himself and avoids talking with others about his experiences. He lives in a constant state of fear which can be identified through his body language. In the past Cole has tried to express what he is dealing but people become quick to judge him negatively. In one scene Cole tells Dr. Crowe about a picture he drew in school of a man killed by a screwdriver to the neck. The school had a meeting with his mother who cried over the event. Cole states ""I don't draw like that anymore...I draw people smiling, dogs running and rainbows"" (Shyamalan, 1999). This scene provides an example of how individuals on the surface present that everything is fine because that is what others want when in reality they may be struggling on the inside. 
 Dr. Crowe in The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) struggles with the decision to continue to help Cole because of the amount of time needed to help him. While Dr. Crowe feels obligated to aid Cole, it is interfering with the time he could be spending with his wife. Dr. Crowe loves his wife but he also knows Cole needs him. This scene helps to understand the conflict some face when deciding what is more important, helping others or focusing on one's own needs
 This film uses two techniques that relate to the theme of fear and the unknown. One technique is motif of a room getting cold. When the presence of the dead are in the room the individual fells a sudden coldness and cold air can be seen from their breath. Another technique involve dark rooms, or the lack of sufficient lighting, where it is hard to make out what is truly there. Unable to clearly see our surrounding allows fear to sit in and imaginations to run wild. These techniques are used for the audience to experience the same sensations as the characters in the film. 
 A similar suspense film Shutter Island (2010) also has a main theme around social problems and how other in society are view that do not fit what is considered normal. The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan, 1999) leaves the audience considering the question of how far one is willing to understand and help someone else who may be in need."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","1","1","21 February 2018"," This seminal horror picture is one of the best in the last twenty years.
","When people talk about this seminal horror picture, they often tend to focus on and overstate the importance of the famous final plot twist which, while a fantastic reveal in its own right, isn't the only or even main reason why the feature has remained such a cultural touchstone and is often remembered as being one of the very best examples of the genre. Instead, the ominous sense of mystery created by the relatively slow and self-assured pacing; the mature and well-crafted scares stemming solely from our connection to the nuanced characters as opposed to obnoxiously loud musical cues; the layered and intelligent screenplay that dares to assume its audience is smart enough to understand what it is presenting; and the phenomenal performances that cement 'The Sixth Sense (1999)' as existing within a grounded reality - including what is arguably the best child performance ever put to film - are what make this emotional, gripping and complex drama stand out as one of the best horror films of the last twenty years. 8/10"

","First of all, I watched this movie for the first time today. I was not aware of the twist and the story beforehand but after watching it I felt like it was pretty obvious. Like, nobody talked to Malcolm except Cole. His wound was always hidden and his wife kissing someone else and dating someone else when Malcolm was living in the basement. I guess maybe I noticed all this because I have read too many mystery novels or watched too many mystery movies. I liked the movie, acting and screenplay and everything.

","** This will contain spoilers!** <br/><br/>In the Sixth Sense, it starts out with a child psychiatrist that is confronted by a former patient. This patient says that Dr. Malcolm failed him. Then cuts to Dr. Malcolm watching a child. He believes that he was hired to help him. Throughout the whole move there are hints and a foreshadowing of then ending. The little boy, Cole, tells Dr. Malcolm that he sees dead people all the time. That they don't know they are dead, that they only see what they want to see. Which is what makes the ending so powerful After watching this film, you see there were so many things that could led you to the ending. Overall I think that the movie shows a lot about death and life. While Cole was living and seeing the dead, even as a scared little boy, took an opportunity to go alone to help a little girl that died and needed him. Just as Dr. Malcolm needs Cole, and didn't realize it as he felt Cole was the one needing saving. This is one of my favorite movies, I watched it as a child and re- watched it for a class and it is still as interesting and brilliant as before. The scenes, the casting, the music, everything in the film was brought together perfectly to become a powerful movie of its time."
"bbewnylorac","8","1","1","15 November 2017"," A lush, absorbing film
","Gorgeous cinematography, rich historic Pennsylvania locations and a tight, intelligent script are what elevates this film above the ordinary horror flick. It has plenty of interesting ideas. Such as, how old buildings have a human history we may not realise, for example the boy Cole's school theatre where there was once a terrible fire, and the three colonial people he sees hanging from a rafter. Cole's kitchen is taken over at night by a battered woman who shrieks and opens all the drawers. It made me think about who used to live in my house. I like the scene where the young couple shop for antique rings - who knows who once owned them? The central affliction of the film - Cole sees dead people - has parallels with sexual abuse. Cole is frightened and disturbed and he can't tell anyone what's wrong because he thinks they won't believe him. He develops little routines, like his figurines and going into a church, to get comfort. The psychologist Malcolm (Bruce Willis) hits on the idea of Cole asking the ghosts what is wrong and offering to help them. It makes you think about angry or sad or disturbed people in the real world. Maybe if someone could get down to the root of their problem, they could get help. Cole discovers that the little girl ghost who keeps vomiting is trying to tell him she was poisoned by her mother, and that no one suspected it. I thought the film could have showed more of this - Cole helping the ghosts out. Malcolm's violent former patient, Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg) is a good reminder that sometimes people's pain is so great they can't be helped. Or maybe Vincent represents what Cole could be like in the future if he is not helped. The twist at the end is a great one. Willis is allowed to demonstrate his cerebral side, and Malcolm's scenes with his estranged wife are a poignant exploration of grief, and of a couple drifting apart."

Everybody should see this movie at least once. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is about a child psychologists who comes into contact with a young boy that has an extraordinary but chilling and creepy gift, he can see ghost, or as he calls them ""Dead People"". This boy is terrified beyond belief, everyday is a nightmare for him, his mother knows something is wrong but the boy will not tell her, for fear she will think him a freak and crazy. The boy lives in solitude, he has no friends and everybody thinks he is a freak. As the story progresses the child psychologists helps him realize that these ghost are not trying to harm the boy, but are trying to communicate with him in a way.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan the director of this masterpiece has given us a thriller here that we will never forget. Me and my wife watched it this past Halloween, and boy did my wife not go to sleep. This movie makes for a great Halloween and popcorn and candy movie to watch, a fantastic cast completes this story, Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment,and Toni Collete. Honestly, I was hoping for a sequel to be made but this is just pure masterpiece to have more made, I could imagine Cole (Haley Joel Osment) the boy who can see ghost grown up and helping ghost. But this one is good enough.<br/><br/>Give it a watch, you will not be disappointed. I would recommend watching this on Halloween with the lights off and by someone you love or with a group of friends. But I have to warn you it does stick, so be prepared to not sleep the first few nights, I slept just fine, it was my wife who had the trouble. LoL :-) <br/><br/>10/10 for The Sixth Sense"

","I enjoy ghost movies, and this one has to be one of the best.<br/><br/>I knew that Bruce Willis's character was going to turn out to be dead -- from the moment the kid announces that he can see ghosts. I thought that his character a bit one-dimensional, though. I'm not sure whether the acting or character development is to blame.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty good on the whole, but the amount of inexcusable gaping plot holes is ridiculous... such as: <br/><br/><ul><li>How did he go one whole year without speaking to anyone or being acknowledged by anyone (except the little boy), and not figure out that something is wrong? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He lives with his wife, and... for a whole year, they manage to co-exist in the same household -- without interacting? Not believable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>So Bruce Willis is a ghost, so why can't he see other ghosts? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The boy knows that his ""therapist"" is a ghost, but he doesn't tell him, and he's not afraid of him the way he is of all the other ghosts.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How did he get assigned to treat that kid? Who'd hire a ghost? How did he collect his salary? How did he interact with the kid's Mom, and whom did he pass his assessments to? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How did a ghost manage to use audio tapes and a PC? We see that he writes and prints out reports. How is that possible for a ghost to do? </li></ul><br/><br/>Basically, there are MANY a plot hole here...<br/><br/>But! It doesn't alter the fact that the movie is entertaining and enjoyable. The kid's acting was impeccable. I have never seen such outstanding performance by a child actor (or even a professional adult actor). I was very impressed.<br/><br/>I think the movie deserves the high rating. Definitely far superior to the lousy ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise. The latter is just a lame joke compared to this one."
"uapoorvgupta21","10","1","1","23 March 2013"," One of the best in horror business!!
","I would say The Sixth Sense in one of the best Horror movies ever made without trying to use a lot of special effects. MNS really tries to create tension in your mind through some mind-boggling scenes that what would happen next.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis has been shown as a child psychologist who has recently won an award and is celebrating with his wife at the beginning. He meets Haley Joel Osment who is a kid who believes he sees dead people walking and trying to communicate with him. At the end of the movie a big suspense is revealed making the viewer shocked. Watch this movie for a brilliant mix of suspense and horror."

","""A boy with a haunting secret seeks help from a child phycologist"" ""I see dead people"".<br/><br/>I don't usually enjoy all these paranormal ghosty stuff but this is one of my all time favourite films. When I first saw this film, it was halloween which added to the suspense of an already very suspense filled film and I have to say I was expecting a clichéd teen thriller with blunt acting and a meaningless storyline- I couldn't have been more wrong!The director's camera shots, lighting and music were perfectly placed to make this an enjoyably terrifying 107mins.i think what really made me want to review the sixth sense was the broad range of genres that were skillfully included;thriller, horror, paranormal, romance,drama, comedy which generally incresed the all round impact of it.<br/><br/>Chilling, haunting,eerie,well written and with an amazing storyline that has you thoroughly gripped all the way through.The only criticism would be that i would have liked to actually see more of the ghosts. Of course i must mention the brilliant acting skills of Bruce Willis in his prime, Haley Joel Osment and Tony Collette whose acting helped keep this film fresh and engaging in a sinister way. M.night Shyamalan, in my opinion is a genius and a true master of screenplay and I feel I couldn't write a review on this film without mentioning what i think is one of the most immpressive, shocking twists in cinematic history perfectly timed to shock you just enough for this to be an all round brilliant film. Like a lot of reviewers i tried to find a storyline error or a plot hole(without success)although it will blow you away, unlike a lot of other films, the twist does not make you feel cheated, just impressed and stunned.I would definitely recommend it to people who are in to thriller, drama and mysteries as i doubt that there will be a thriller or any movie as skillfully written as this for years to come."

","Sixth Sense is a well written movie that hits you from every end, here is a movie that tests your wits, you find yourself struggling to understand the character's predicament, and trying to see why things seem out of place, then you get to the ending of the film and M. Night Shyamalan trait of surprise ending hits you flat in the face and you go ""OH! That's why""<br/><br/>Sixth Sense is a movie that is so great but sadly it is not a movie for retakes, since the entire suspense is revealed in the end, the actors in the movie also performed well, especially Joel Osment and there is Bruce Willis, showing off his prowess as one of the great actors of our time. To me Sixth Sense is the best movie I have seen him in, although the Die Hard series are exceptional, this movie just stands out in your mind and heart.<br/><br/>Sixth Sense is a psychological horror film about the perils of a young boy Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole lives an isolated life, finding it difficult to mix with others; he sometimes sustains injuries on his body, which he gets when attacked, by the people he sees and talks to, people whom others cannot see. Cole sees and talks to dead people.<br/><br/>A child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) with troubles of his own comes on board to try and help Cole deal with his problem, all to find revelations about his life that he was not expecting.<br/><br/>Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the movie script was first purchased by Disney before it was sold to Spyglass; Disney's president believed the movie was not going to be a hit. The movie production budget was 40 million and it was a financial success making over 600 million in the box office and the movie's tag line, ""I see dead people"" is a popular catchphrase, used by many other movies, TV and songs.<br/><br/>Sadly though this classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but won none, this doesn't take anything from this movie as it remains a classic in every way.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece introducing Shyamalan for a great writer and director, this and Signs (2002) (with Mel Gibson) stand out as my favourite of his films. There is no need to spare any cash, just dash to the DVD store and get a copy of this masterpiece if you have not gotten the privilege of seeing it yet.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"jason-godin232","10","1","1","29 October 2012"," One of the greatest!
","So, the movie I just watched was ""The Sixth Sense"" Many people ask, why is M. Night Shyamalan still directing and writing movies, when everything he makes now is crap. Well the answers to this, is because of this movie. By far one of the greatest Thriller movie of all time.<br/><br/>It's about a young boy who has the ability to see and communicate with Dead People. This little boy's name is Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment, and for you gamers out there who absolutely love Kingdom Hearts, he's the same actor who does the voice of Sora. After an accident that happened to a Child Psychologist Dr. Malcolm, played by Bruce Willis, whereas one of his former patient had shot him, because Malcolm wasn't able to help him. He decides he needs to do what's right, and he find Cole, who had the same symptoms as Vincent, the boy who shot Malcolm.<br/><br/>This movie has drama, funny moments and it's an extremely emotional movie. The acting is so good and so pure that you can't help but feel like you're right in there in the movie. The child Haley Joel Osment has so much talent in acting, that at the time he was 11 and does way better acting than most actors who had 25+ years in the trade.<br/><br/>The story is overwhelmingly good and the development and psychology in this movie just gives you goosebumps all over the entire movie.<br/><br/>Why M. Night Shyamalan...how did you produce something so good an pure, and throw us crap with your other projects. I'm guessing the guys at Hollywood think ""We have faith that this Shyamalan will somehow bring us gold one day.<br/><br/>And the ending! It made me stand up and yell out ""Oh My God! This is genius!!!"" I give The Sixth Sense, a 9.5/10 Officially one of my personal Favorite movies."
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","10","1","1","26 October 2012"," An epic start to M. Night Shyamalan's career in filmmaking!
","After I saw some of Shyamalan films except ""The Village"", ""The Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening"" three films in which I have yet to see even though they got mixed to negative reviews, I looked past at his very first film that started his film career known as ""The Sixth Sense"", a tale about a child psychologist who receives an award on the same night that he is visited by a very unhappy ex-patient. After this encounter, Crowe takes on the task of curing a young boy with the same ills as the ex-patient. When it happened, the boy named Cole starts to see dead people and Crowe spends a lot of time with him while Cole's mother plans with his increasing problems and it's up to Crowe to cure him since he is his only hope.<br/><br/>When I saw the entire thing, I was really creep-ed out by it and I realized that M. Night Shyamalan had created such a compelling film it became an epic start to his career in filmmaking history which is why I'm giving this an 100% rating. The story is well-written with a nice ending twist and has some brilliant atmospheric moments that would not only haunt you, but creep you out in the process. The music from James Newton Howard is great and fits really well for the emotional scenes in the film along with M. Night Shyamalan's solid directing which has a lot of focus with the tone of the movie. The pacing is brisk and it has some great character development especially the chemistry between Crowe and Cole. In fact, the acting is excellent. Bruce Willis did wonderful, Haley Jole Osment did such a compelling job as a frightened 10-year old, Toni Colette did fine as the boy's mother and Olivia Williams did great as Malcolm's wife.<br/><br/>Overall, The Sixth Sense is a classic and it has been a long time since the quote ""I see dead people"" became so popular since the film's release at the late 90s. My advice to those who have not seen the movie: go watch it before Halloween starts. It is that good!"
"Desertman84","10","1","1","19 October 2012"," The Sixth Sense Deserves The Highest Rating
","The Sixth Sense is a psychological horror film that features Bruce Willis,Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. Added to that,it was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.The movie tells the story of Cole Sear, a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist who tries to help him that established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings.<br/><br/>Dr. Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist whose new patient has a problem far outside his usual area of expertise. Cole Sear is six-years- old and claims to see the spirits of dead people all around him. It seems that Cole has psychic powers and can channel the ghosts of those who were troubled. Cole doesn't understand his powers, and he has little control over them; he's constantly terrified by what he sees, and Dr. Crowe is the only one with whom he feels he can share this secret. However, as the doctor digs deeper into Cole's strange powers, it leads to strange and unexpected consequences for both of them.<br/><br/>An excellent premiere for new director as he packs a punch with a great story, excellent directing, a great cast, great performances, and a surprise ending that will leave you breathless for days on end. Osment is excellent, as is Bruce Willis, as a melancholy child psychologist scarred by his failure with a similarly haunted youth, and Toni Collette, as the boy's fiercely loyal mother.It was a twisty ghost story with all the style of a classical Hollywood picture but all the chills of a modern horror flick that deserves the highest rating."
"Al_The_Strange","9","1","1","10 October 2012"," ""I see dead people.""
","When this movie came out, it garnered a huge amount of hype and acclaim, and I regarded this film as something of a masterpiece. It represented a type of quality filmmaking and storytelling that only men like Hitchcock seemed to master. It was one of the few films that initially established M. Night Shyamalan as a promising director of quality substance (a reputation that would only last for his next two films, Unbreakable and Signs; the rest of his work became arguably weaker and weaker, until reaching rock bottom with The Last Airbender).<br/><br/>The story is pretty evenly-paced, but it is a slow-moving one. There's not a whole lot of conflict involved with this, but it's built pretty sturdily on the occasional paranormal fright scene and plenty of mystery.<br/><br/>What really matters here is the story, and it is perfectly constructed. It's most famous for its twist ending, but it's not just an arbitrary narrative trick; in this case, the whole movie was built around that twist, so that it holds up on multiple viewings and gives new meaning every time. With quality characters that you can actually care for, and some strong themes concerning people and their gifts, the rest of the story stands strongly on its own and has plenty of insight.<br/><br/>This film is immortalized with solid photography and editing. Acting is extremely delicate and subtle, with great nuanced performances by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment. Writing shows some penchant for a little too much exposition (a standard complaint for most of Shyamalan's work, and it really only shows when compared to his later features), but is otherwise very good. This production doesn't have anything lavish, but it makes good use of its utilitarian sets, props, and costumes. Music is nice.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)"

","The only good movie M.

Bruce Willis fits the role well, and the little kid (Osment) is great. What should be notice even more is what an extraordinary job Toni Collette did in this movie. The scene where they (Osment and Collette) are in the car and he says to his ""mother"" that he is a freak, Collette's emotional reaction is so realistic. I have the greatest respect for her talent after that. I think she deserves greater roles.<br/><br/>Shyamalan hasn't been able to make or write a single piece of good movie making ever since, which makes me suspect he had a lot of help on Sixth Sense.

When scares come they are very scary. Acting is great. The most credit in acting should go Haley Joel Osment who knocks it out of the park, and gives one of the best child acting performances ever. M. Night does a great job putting this thing together. Too bad he went from this to ""The Happening"". The story is one of coolest ghost stories ever told. This is a very good plot.

"abrown975","9","1","1","13 August 2010"," An absolutely brilliant masterpiece in every aspect it utilizes
","There are only a handful of movies out there that have everything in it. Thankfully, this movie is one of them. What I mean by that is it has the horror (the absolutely creepy/terrifying type, not the crappy something-pops-out-and-startles-you junk), the sadness (Jesus, I pretty much just end up feeling sorry for every character), the happiness (and when the happiness comes, you feel so genuinely happy and warm that you could cry), and the best part- the twists (the kind that hits you like a ton of bricks, not some stupid, run-o-the-mill misleads and whatnot). But that's not all. The acting was beyond superb. Bruce Willis was spectacular as the main character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I honestly think an Academy Award nomination should have been given for him. But the Academy made up for that in giving, first off, Toni Collette a nomination. She had such a great performance as the distraught mother who only wanted a normal life for her son. But the real praise should go to young Haley Joel Osment, who also had an A.A. nomination, but should have won in my opinion. I will not go into depth because there is just not enough good things to say about his absolutely brilliant performance. The only thing I will say is that he had one of the most convincing and emotional performances of anyone I have ever seen, and he was only 11 at the time! However, a lot of the applause should go to M. Night. Shyamalan, whose writing and directing just goes to show that when he has the right material, he can REALLY make it work! I really hope he gets more opportunities to show off his talent, let's just hope he doesn't do anymore TV show remakes (The Last Airbender was just plain awful). This movie is such a beautiful masterpiece, and that's saying something considering it's a horror film!"
"martijn-56","10","1","1","2 June 2010"," The standard for the twist story genre
","I consider this the very best twist-story I have ever seen, followed at great distance by The Others. That I am not the only one, of course, is best shown by the great spin-off, included those by the same director. And even more the fact, that none succeeded to equal, let alone surpass this movie. The movie is compelling and keeps you intrigued to the end, and the end, well, it is legendary. To me it is so brilliant, like you have seen two good movies in one. Many movies of the twist-genre, if I may call it that, do not respect the checklist for endings. And ending should wrap things up, tie up loose ends, without tearing the story we have seen so far apart (in the worst case telling the reader it was all a dream). The sixth sense does this better than any movie before or since. But before I get to that, let's start at the beginning. It started with Bruce Willis getting shot by his former patient, now a grown man still troubled by apparently non-existing phenomena. It gives the right background, since we are introduced to the main character, Bruce Willis, being a child psychologist, who has dropped the ball somewhere along the line. Or not? Was that patient mad? The rest of the story is about Bruce Willis' character seeking redemption for his failure, as he feels it, by trying to do it right next time. That chance comes with the gifted child that is showing the same problems. But before that, remember the cut? After Bruce was gunned down you see him suddenly sitting, the next fall, on a couch outside, waiting for the young boy. It struck me as lonely, and strange. Of course, in hindsight, it was all deliberately put there including the clever camera work and fall setting, as any good story should only contain things that belong there for a reason. I thought: where is the hospital, where is the wife? Why is the atmosphere so lonely, and deserted? Well we know now why, but I did not then, so this was one question, one unsolved delayed bit of information â€“ always a good thing to keep the reader, or watcher, hooked. Also his contact with his wife: distant, short visits, monologues rather than discussions. I thought they are in a fight, but about what? The end provided the explanation: they were not in a fight, but she could not see him, and she looked sad since she was mourning about her dead husband. A very smart way of twisting a story. It is very hard to do, especially since the whole movie you have seen stays intact, even after the surprise. All you saw happened, only from a different perspective. Just when I started to think the start was too weird, I was intrigued just in time by the ghosts that came along with the little boy Bruce had as a patient. I thought it would end up like Poltergeist, the spirits entering the real world, Bruce having to sacrifice himself, redemption, end. But the real horror came from the people themselves, with of course the climax the video of the dead girl, showing she was poisoned by her stepmother. A very different approach and hard to do, but this movie succeeded in being scary without showing the obvious spooks alone, but with staying in the real world. Take 'The Others', for instance, that movie had the advantage of the claustrophobic effect you automatically get when you choose an isolated place, like the estate they were on. The Sixth Sense only had the open world, a city, as we know it, and the heroes could walk anywhere. Not easy to create a scary atmosphere, there, since the characters could just go away when things got scared, right? But they couldn't , since the ghost where all over the place, too. All the questions I had during the movie were all perfectly wrapped up in the end. I thought: why would Bruce find out now, not earlier or later, he was dead? Well, he had come full circle, he helped the boy where he could not help a boy in the past. If he would let go now, his wife could move on and she was ready, having a new boyfriend. The time was right. The boy, he came full circle too: by listening to the ghosts, he would find out he was no freak since they did exist. They were there and by listening to them he could be of use to the people that they left behind. Also his mother understood her son was just gifted and not a freak, by the somewhat over emotional scene with him telling about her dead mother showing up at some high school event, something he could obviously not have known. It is extremely hard to wrap all things up this perfect, and the reason this movie does it nevertheless, is because it showed a carefully constructed story which was possible to interpret in two ways all the time. By diverting me to the ghosts themselves, I totally forgot to bother about what was going on with Bruce Willis' character himself and his wife, and why it did not fit. It stayed in the back of my head, but the ghosts were even more dominant. Brilliant, you can only do this once. Furthermore I can add the acting is very good, and the camera-work also, especially the scene with the stepmother. So all the way to the end, the movie is surprising, intriguing and scary. It left the Poltergeist or Exorcist approach and by staying in the real world it made the ghosts even more scary, or exciting if that is the word. The end itself is the biggest surprise any movie has shown, and manages yet to leave all you saw intact, even adding a depth to the story. Perfect. A perfect story, made into a perfect movie. Ten stars."

"Sanpaco13","10","1","1","22 May 2009"," An amazingly deep story and a must see
","I saw this movie originally in the theater when I was 17 or 16 back in the summer of 1999. I remember being scared by the ghosts and dead people and that's about it. I even went to see it a couple of times including one night when I went to see it at the Drive-In with a friend and didn't get home until about 1:30 am. As I entered the house that night I couldn't help but hear Cole's voice in my head saying ""I see dead people"" and I ran to my room trying to keep myself from screaming out in terror. I remember that this was the first movie with a major plot twist in it that I remember really striking me as noteworthy. I'm sure I had seen others before but this one was kind of a hype for a little while. ""Did you see 6th Sense? How about that twist? Wasn't that crazy!"" Despite that, I remember that I didn't really understand it completely. I guess you could say that I was kind of immature both in life experience to be able to draw the conclusions I was supposed to about the characters and I was also inexperienced in the art of following a movie plot beyond the complexity of good guy has conflict, adventure, solve conflict, the end. So as a 16 year old I enjoyed having the pee my pants scares and that is why I liked this movie.<br/><br/>After that I didn't really watch the movie again. I saw it a few times in the theaters and a couple times through the next year or so on DVD. Recently however, I bought a copy and its been sitting on my shelf waiting to be watched. Tonight I finally got around to popping it in and giving it another go. I can't believe how much there is to this movie that I never quite understood before. OK yeah Bruce Willis is a ghost and the kid can see dead people. But there's so much more than that. You have a little kid who can see dead people but who is terrified of them and is also terrified of telling anyone about his secret for fear of being called a freak and taken to the funny farm. He is conflicted by these two fears for most of the movie. You have his mother who loves her son so much and does all she can to try and help him but just doesn't know what he needs. And then you have a child psychiatrist who, due to a failure to help a similar child before, has been killed and doesn't know he is a ghost. There is drama, suspense, and yes even some terror along the way as Dr. Crowe tries to help Cole find out how to deal with his problem. Cole is able to learn how to speak to the dead people and help them to take care of the unfinished business that is keeping them from resting in peace. The scene where he gives the father the video tape of the mother killing poisoning their daughter isn't actually important as far as any of the details of that particular instance rather it is important in that Cole is helping the dead person connect with the living. This draws an interesting parallel when we find out that Dr. Crowe is a ghost too. This ghost was killed by a former patient who could also see dead people and whom Dr. Crowe failed to help. Since then, he has not felt confident as a child psychiatrist anymore. Then he finds a new case like that of the boy that shot him. It is pretty much identical. And his unfinished business is both to help this boy where he failed before, and then the boy's job is to help him with his unfinished business by helping him figure out how to communicate with his wife. I don't know what that is called, kind of like a paradox or a catch-22. Character A is supposed to help character B but the only way for A to help B is by letting B help A. Kind of like the chicken and the egg. Paradigm? Anyway, with things starting to change for Dr. Crowe, he goes home and begins to speak to his wife as she is asleep. This is when he realizes that he is dead due to the fact that she is holding his wedding ring. He remembers being shot, he remembers dying, he begins to see things that he didn't see before such as the bookcase blocking the door that he has been trying to open. And now that he sees he is dead he is able to tell his wife what he needs to and move on.<br/><br/>I don't know about you but to me that is a great story. There are wonderful tidbits in the details of the story as well such as the scene with Cole and his mom in the car when he tells her about seeing his grandmother. That scene almost had me in tears this time around. The acting and the writing were wonderful all around in this movie. The story has so much more to offer than I ever knew it did."

"mrmoviefreak261-1","10","1","1","14 August 2008"," One of the smartest horror/thriller films
","Sixth Sense gives that uncomfortable feeling that no one likes to get when watching horror flicks. You start sweating and and heart races kind of fast, and your head goes crazy and you don't know what to think. That's what I was going through when I first watched this. Well you might think my actions are a bit over dramatic, but I was only eight. The Sixth Sense is not a stupid horror film. It's smart, moves along well, and it's not going to disappoint. The acting is acceptable and the directing and the feel of the film just makes you feel like you're there with the boy, facing his fears, and feeling what's going through his innocent and limited mind. Bruce Willis is very good in it, and he's a great character, being a psychiatrist for kids. You'd never guess he was John McClane. This film is a revolution to horror scenarios. This horror film doesn't depend on images to scare you, like The Exorcist, and it doesn't fully work with you mentally like The Silence of the Lambs to scare you out, but rather it uses something different. It attracts your Sixth Sense, and gives you another kind of scared feeling. Watch this movie, and make sure you finish the whole thing straight, not stopping it, or you won't enjoy the film like most people who watched it."

","""The Sixth Sense"" is about a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe who is assigned to help a child through his mother's divorce. Whilst helping, he learns that the child has an interesting gift, or a curse: He can see ghosts. Now, Malcolm Crowe must help him through this, while going through some marital problems of his own.<br/><br/>All I can say is: This shocked me! M. Night Shyamalan does a great job with keeping you focused on this movie, because this is a movie that you have to keep your full attention on. I won't give away the twist, but trust me, it's a good one. It will surprise you in the end, unless you've look it up on some spoiler website."
"sashank_kini-1","9","1","1","27 July 2008"," "" I see a great movie""
","I wasn't much keen on seeing this movie until one day it came on the television and I felt extremely delighted to have switched to that channel than watching the usual trash. THe thing that manly clicked about this movie was the smoothness at which the director/writer Mr. Shyamalan tells his story in just about 2 hours, which is well paced yet not too fast, unlike some movies that are very well made, but extended too much even after you feel that the story should have got over.<br/><br/>I was utterly shocked during the end of this movie when I watched it the first time as I never thought of such a thing as most of the Bollywood movies are not thriller and very few of them have a mastermind of a writer like Shyamalan to have such a mind- boggling ending. That's probably one of the reason that he was presented the Padma Shree or Padma Bhushan award in India. I haven't seen his other films except for the Village which too was good but after this movie, I feel that he has rightfully been handed this award, unlike some people in India who expressed their displeasure when he was given this award. The reason why they felt it was unfair was because they had not seen this magnificent masterpiece.<br/><br/>I was glad to know that it was a small budget film and did not contain exorbitant furniture or other accessories just to advertise the products or even a huge haunted mansion that would have made this a typical horror flick. This movie haunted me from within, than scaring me from outside or making me sick by showing people cutting other peoples' flesh etc. It was a wonderful psychological thriller with no fancy items to show how expensive the movie is. <br/><br/>This movie had some of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history, like the sick girl's story and the iconic climax. It also had one of the best performances given by the actors. I would especially like to mention the little kid who acted so well that I was completely in amazement that he did this at the age of eleven. Bruce Willis too has done a commendable job and I thought that he would be worthy enough to get at least an Oscar nomination, which he didn't. The kid's mother too has done a very good job, especially in the emotional sequences but I felt that her make up was overdone and it made her look like an evil character.<br/><br/>I think I'll sum it up by saying that this is one of the best thrillers I have watched. I'll give it a nine out of 10."
"dead47548","9","1","1","2 April 2008"," I benefited a lot from revisiting it.
","I saw this film a few years ago and remembered a few scenes, but not the majority of it. The one big problem being that one of the things I did remember was the twist. So going through this re-watch it all seemed very, very obvious but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I knew what it was. Either way, it's a good story; compelling and incredibly unique that I was able to enjoy a lot. I quite enjoyed Shyamalan's use of the color red (his use of colors in all of his films is quite extraordinary, really). The twist is a good one and adds a lot of depth to the characters, especially Malcolm, obviously. I really like the idea of him being around for the sole purpose of helping Cole learn to live with his sixth sense after being killed a year ago because he failed to help someone with the same gift. That's the twist that really made an impression on me and stunned me for a second; the fact that the man who murdered him was such a nutcase and killed him due to the fact that he had the same gift Cole has and Malcolm couldn't help him with it. I liked that complexity in the character a lot. Some of the scenes are very melodramatic and overdone and I really, really hated the editing (it was just too abrupt and out of place) but overall I thought it was compelling and the ambiance was very well structured. Toni Collette was pretty great also, especially in her final scene where Cole tells her about his gift; she was really heartbreaking there and had my eyes watering up. I think Shyamalan's masterpiece comes in his next feature, Unbreakable, but this is still a solid film that I'm glad I revisited."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","1","15 March 2008"," A rare 'twist' movie that holds up to repeated viewings
","Everyone knows that this movie has one of the best 'twist' endings in recent film history. Hopefully you haven't had it spoiled for you because seeing the movie for the first time wouldn't be the same if you knew the ending beforehand. That being said, if you're revisiting the movie then I think you'll find that it holds up surprisingly well, even though the element of surprise is gone.<br/><br/>The main reason for this is that you can now appreciate how the film was constructed in a way that concealed the twist in plain view. There are various clues throughout which take on a second meaning on repeated viewings. In my opinion there are maybe a couple of questionably 'cheap' tricks but it does all fit within the logic the 'twist'.<br/><br/>Another thing that keeps the movie entertaining is the atmosphere. This is unquestionably Shyamalan's best directorial effort, effectively building a sense of mystery and dread, all without resorting to the over-the-top gore typical of horror films. James Newton Howard's eerie score is also an essential ingredient in building atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting is good all around but, for the most part, unexceptional. In my mind Toni Collette gave the best performance, one that was justly rewarded by an Oscar nomination. Haley Joel Osment also nabbed a nomination but I wasn't that impressed by his performance, though it was definitely above average for such a young actor.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film already try to catch it before the 'twist' has been revealed to you either by someone else or by a cultural reference. If you have seen it, watch it again to gain an appreciation of the film's construction."
"billion_mucks","9","1","1","5 December 2007"," Manipulation of Fears ""Par Excellence""
","Little Cole Sear (Halley Joel Osment) is a child that seems apart from the current world, called ""a freak"" by his companions and always distracted and reluctant to connect to the others. Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) intends to help him in order to redeem himself from a bad past experience. But as Dr. Crowe deepens into the interior of Cole, he will uncover his most profound and frightening secret.<br/><br/>At the moment it starts, Shyamalan jolts with an uncanny music, formed by the precise scratching of superb violins. All throughout the movie the music will be vibrating, exhilarating, electrifying and yet oddly repulsive and leaving a sense of dismay and creepiness. Counting on lofty performances, emotional and groundbreaking by Halley Joel Osment, Toni Collete and star Bruce Willis, Shyamalan will clear it's field to proceed with his cunning game of manipulating the fear of the viewer. He will show you simple things, he will input the terror on ordinary stuff and common and daily elements: he will terrorize you with the using of a tape- recorder to hear whispers, he will play smartly with the shadows, mirrors, claustrophobic spaces to gasp the audience, and the use of an eerie wind always blowing to give the sense of distance and cold. He will give you a little space to start, then the fear will start erupting inside your mind.<br/><br/>The photography by Tak Fujimoto is intense and subtle, never approaching with direct focus but with transversal, lateral imposing lens and toying softly with the use of reflections, rolling cameras and visuals in odd places that give the film superb aesthetics. Overall, the technical aspects contribute on leaving on the viewer a feeling of dread and restlessness, awkwardness.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is genius at creating this suspense, avoiding blood and imposing a sly fear. That is why he became so popular.<br/><br/>He also delivers a lot of psychological substance, a lot of profound lines of thinking. Joel's Osment relationship with his father is portrayed with great touches, like the glasses with no crystals and the watch not working he received from him. The Indian Director also exposes his viewings on explaining a story within his sublime script. At one point Malcolm tries to tell Cole a story: -You never told a story before right? You have to add some twists and stuff.<br/><br/>Well prepare, because it is highly auto-referential. The script also brings forth bewitching descriptions of fear ""like falling down inside but you are standing still"". And then prepare for the twist. It will shake you to the ground and burn all of your movie principles. It is the Twist, what made the movie genius and so iconic.<br/><br/>""Sixth Sense"" is a cinematic bulwark, standing on an eternal and sublime direction. Its ending is emotional, and touching. This, in order to make contrast to the excellent creation of suspense and fear that bulges through the movie. Masterful."

","The only good movie director/writer M. Night Shyamalan has done, The Sixth Sense is a clever, well-made, well-written and quite moving story. Bruce Willis is effective in one of his non-macho, non-action roles, playing a psychologist who becomes involved with a troubled young boy played by Hayley Joel Osment. This is also Hayley Joel's best film and the one that made him a top-notch child actor. Those halcyon days are probably gone for him after the abysmal Artificial Intelligence and later films.<br/><br/>One has to be careful describing too much of the plot of this film so I'll avoid doing that. Suffice it to say that this is a film that really holds your interest and the relationship that develops between Willis and Osment is very touching. The climax of the film is justly one of the most famous in all of film."

","M. Night Shymalan actually makes a good movie with this supernatural thriller starring Bruce Willis as a child therapist assigned to a boy with an amazing gift. Haley Joel Osment is awesome as Cole Sear, the little boy who can see dead people.<br/><br/>Cole's visions are disturbing, but the film is not scary or suspenseful. What gives it the edge and my thumbs up are the fantastic performances. Osment and Toni Collette are both Oscar material.

It is the first movie in which Haley Joel Osment was able to present his acting skills to a broad public that applauded him frenetically. He is sheer brilliant, no doubt. In my eyes, Haley leads the table of outstanding all-time performances by any young actor, followed scantly by Elijah Wood. This movie has suspense, it has frightening sequences, it has mystery and thrilling crime aspects, all of these superbly converging on Haley Joels' character. It is his very own personal ability to show emotional feelings and assign them on to the viewers that makes his performances so authentic and sensational."
"mftuchman","7","1","1","29 September 2005"," Powerful and Sweet, but a little Schmaltzy in places
","This movie has been out for six years. Although this appears to be a story about the supernatural, it is really about our hopes that we never are completely separated from those who love, or loved us.<br/><br/>After a traumatic evening with a man breaking into their house, our Hero's life goes into a tailspin. He cannot seem to connect with his new patient, a young boy with similar symptoms to one he could not treat. His wife is distant and uncommunicative. He often has difficulty keeping track of time. And on top of all this, the patient claims to be able to see dead people. Sure, here's an easy case to solve in a stress filled life.<br/><br/>This often has parallels to our own lives, as those who love us come closer and farther in a gentle, undulating wave. But we are not prepared for the separation that no amount of work can undo. It is this poignancy that the movie captures so expertly. Granted, it is couched in supernatural terms, but the lessons for us mere mortals should be clear.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is superb. James Newton Howard has made several mediocre movies quite bearable, and here he makes a good film into an excellent one. The track is truly one of the important characters in the film, and does its job by staying in the background without interference.<br/><br/>There are some moments of startling horror. I have seen this movie many times and I still jump at places.<br/><br/>The pacing is well done, and the characters are all developed sufficiently for you to care about them. After six years, I still recommend the Sixth Sense."

","""The Sixth Sense,"" introduced the world to M.Night Shyamalan and his infamous twist. You know the kind: where you are still sitting in your seat for moments, shaking your head and wondering how you couldn't see it coming.<br/><br/>The film starts with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis),a child psychologist who is celebrating with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams)on winning an award. Their celebration is cut short when Malcolm is shot by Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg, in a creepy performance), who accuses him of failing him and turning him into a freak.<br/><br/>Sometime later, a disillusioned Malcolm meets Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who seems to have some problems of his own. From one point of view, he is seen as a disturbed kid (cuts and bruises, and disturbing drawings). However, we soon discover the reason behind his behavior: He sees dead people (One of the most quoted lines in film history here!). He is terrified by what he sees (especially when the people he sees have died violent deaths)and doesn't know how to handle it. He can't even explain what is going on to his mother Lynn (Toni Collette), who is trying desperately to help him.<br/><br/>For a while, Malcolm has his doubts. And his relationship with his wife since the shooting has gone downhill, but after listening to an old therapy tape with young Vincent, he begins to believe Cole.<br/><br/>With his help, Cole learns how to deal with his gift and to help others. By the end of the film, Cole communicates his secret to his mother and Malcolm communicates with his wife, but when this is done, lives will be changed forever. And both scenes are so incredibly powerful: Cole's conversation with his mother brings me to tears, and you can see the weight life off him when he shares his secret to his Mother.<br/><br/>And this is the moment when you are still sitting in the chair, shaking your head in total amazement.<br/><br/>This is an excellent psychological horror film and all of the performances (Especially Osment)are incredible. You get scared and teary eyed at the same time."

Willis is Malcolm Crowe, a gifted child psychologist who is shot in his bedroom by a deranged former patient. A few years later he encounters a young kid named Cole, who is experiencing similar symptoms and appears to be harboring a well kept secret that he doesn't wish to share with anyone. But Crowe keeps pushing to discover what is troubling the boy as his marriage gets worse and worse. What could it be? The answer is as frightening as it is uncontrollable.

When a former patient, Vincent, breaks into the house, he learns that his excellent work has not done all the good that he'd hoped, in fact his promise to a young patient that everything would work out alright, has not come true, and results in the young man's suicide.  He tries to make sure this will never happen with another patient.<br/><br/>Later that fall, he finds Cole, a boy who is suffering from the same symptoms as Vincent.  Cole spends his free time playing in a church, so the ghosts won't frighten him.  As Malcolm studies the case further, he finds connections between the two boys, and figures that by helping Cole deal with his problems, surely stemming from his father's abandonment, he can redeem himself from his failure with Vincent.<br/><br/>Eventually he figures that Cole is telling the truth, that he can see beyond what is apparent in this world.  It is by allowing him to face his fears, and use the gift he's been given to help the departed rest in peace and comfort those still living, that he can himself live without fear.  He doesn't need to hide in either a church or a tent in his bedroom filled with religious statues.<br/><br/>Malcolm didn't think that something glibly promised in a session with Vincent would come to such a drastic conclusion.  He didn't think that Cole could actually see dead people, and was suffering from severe pathology and school-age schizophrenia.  He didn't think there was any realm beyond the five senses.  He wasn't counting on a little boy, like a boy he had counseled years earlier, had a sixth sense that enabled a person to see beyond what is normally perceived, to the world of souls who had not realized that their bodies had died when they had work still to do.<br/><br/>Likewise, I didn't think that the movie would have such a startling conclusion.  I hadn't seen it coming, and had trusted that what I'd seen naturally led to the conclusion of Malcolm's restored marriage, since he'd alienated his wife by being obsessed with Cole's case, and find faith in himself, that he was a good doctor who could heal children's troubled minds and really deserved an award for excellence.  Without that ending, it would've been a good movie.  With it, it was a great movie.  If the mind can be tricked in this way, within the span of two hours, it might also be tricked about preconceived ideas about what happens after death, to consider the existence of spirits lost on their way to the afterlife."

This movie is one of a select few that pulls it off to such a successful degree. The acting is fabulous (Toni Collette steals the show, hands down...) the story remains fresh and intriguing the whole way through, and believe you me... the ending did indeed throw me for a loop.<br/><br/>M.

"patagonia_moviemania","Null","1","1","31 March 2003"," See it at least twice to credit you've understood it!
","A film that I saw two years ago in the local cinema in Cutral Co, Argentina, just on my birthday  was this amazing film written and directed by M Night Shyalaman, starred by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osmeid and others. Since that moment I've turned into a fan of The Sixth Sense and why not of Shyalaman's scripts.<br/><br/>The film takes you about two hours and a half to watch, but it will take you nearly a month to understand. The Sixth Sense, which is set in Philadelphia -land of the most popular boxer on the screen ""Rocky""- is a dramatic and suspense movie with a bit of horror.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis as Malcom Crowe and Joel Osmeid who starred Cole Sear are the main characters. They stay together and need each other during the film. The Sixth Sense is the story of a boy who can see dead people that talk to him asking for help, but Cole Sear is scared and he won't control this gift unless he lets Malcom Crowe help him with this phenomenon.<br/><br/>I was very surprised about the ending of the film (which I'm not going to reveal!!!), because Bruce Willis gives a dramatic, emotive and unexpected way to his character, as well as Osmeid, who despite being a young actor, seemed to be an expert one.<br/><br/>I liked the acting, but without organisation and leading this would have been nothing, which means I liked the direction too. Make-up artists and dressers made a fantastic work, also costumes helped the photography director to highlight his job in the horror scenes.I think the sound technicians made a perfect work because the music was very good and the sound fused fantasy with horror.<br/><br/>If you like films difficult to understand, and to see them again and again and again, this one is for you: you'll have to see it at least twice to credit that you've understood this exceptional film.<br/><br/>Marcos Istueta, 15, Cutral Co, Argentina."
"Crashed Aeroplane","3","1","1","18 December 1999"," Did you say ""death"" ?
","I -like many thanks to good promotion - went to the cinema without any idea of ""the oh-so clever ending"" and came out not really caring. I'm not going to critise anyone involved in the film as the direction was exellent and Bruce Willis put in a very good preformance, the kid, whatever his name is, was believable and on the whole the story was well told.<br/><br/>But so what, the script was nothing more than another quirky idea from Hollywood and really didn't drag you into the situation, it was nothing special and the reason it did so well was because it posed as an intelligent film with blockbuster selling points. Add to this the fact that the cinema was more popular than ever this year and people aren't wanting to see ***** in another ""I have more guns than you have"" film and it was bound to be a huge hit, but it didn't really deserve it."
"JMG-5","5","1","1","15 December 1999"," Custom-built for mass appeal
","**Spoilers**<br/><br/>
There's nothing particularly awful about this film, there's just nothing particularly great about it either. About 10 minutes into it, the ending is painfully obvious and the climax - where Cole finally reveals his ""problem"" to Malcolm - has been given away from the very start by the overzealous trailers. What we're left with is an hour and a half of tedious plot exposition and a denouement that is so contrived it makes you wonder what the point of the entire movie was. Then the ""surprise"" comes and you realize that the entire point was to fool you with the ending! If you were fooled then the movie worked; if not then it probably didn't.<br/><br/>
On a positive note: the performances were very good - notably, Osment and Colette - and the cinematography was excellent. Ultimately, however, - unless you are terrified even thinking about ghosts - the Sixth Sense is only mildly entertaining and, upon a second viewing, even less so. 5/10"
"zetes","9","1","1","14 December 1999"," I think the surprise ending hurts the overall greatness of the film
","I saw this film months ago when it first came out, and I never stopped thinking about it. It is the only film of this year that deserved to make a lot of money (The Matrix and The Phantom Menace disappointed me terribly). It is unlike the rest of the movies Hollywood throws out. Unlike the empty Matrix and the Phantom Menace, the Sixth Sense is a character driven drama. It comes to a conclusion that no other ghost movie (that I've ever seen) has touched on. I think the film has a good chance to snatch up some Oscar noms. I think it deserves nods for script and definitely Best Supporting Actor in Osment (though he really is the main character, he is pushed to second string because of the bigger star). I wouldn't even be offended if Willis got a nom, seeing that this is his best film besides maybe 12 Monkeys and Pulp Fiction. <br/><br/>Now for the ending that I mentioned in my summary. Most people will know about it this late in the game, but I won't tell. I think it pulls attention away from the true greatness of the film, which is the characters. It is what we were talking about after we left the theater, and I'm disappointed at myself for doing so. Sure it was neat, but I have gone through it in my mind several times, finding flaws within the film. Surprise endings are almost always detractors. If you remember a film just because of its surprise ending, it is a worthless film, just like The Usual Suspects, a very bad film if anyone would actually think about something besides the ending. <br/><br/>overall 8/10, being a 9 originally, but losing 1 point for its supposed hook."
"Phil Dog","3","1","1","26 September 1999"," A Titanic-like film, which is to say really over-rated
","Let me begin by saying that Sixth Sense is not a ""bad"" movie, instead it is an average movie.  The whole film was built ground up from the ending, and no film has ever made it so painfully obvious that the ending was written first and then a story was added to make it long enough.  Also I have a terrible bit of information to tell everyone, Bruce Willis is really bad at acting like he cares.  It didn't work in Armageddon, it doesn't work here, and it's not going to work the next time he's cast as a truly caring man. Though in all honesty if you think about this film in great detail you realize he does not care, and is simply incredibly self-serving.  Despite all my personal distaste for this film, it is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is nothing more than average.  The plot is relatively simple, and if you go into the theater actually thinking you'll know how the movie is going to end within half an hour.  The only real reason to see this movie is so that you can see if you can figure out the ending before the end of the film.  After you've seen this once and seen how it ends, it is incredibly unlikely that the weak plot line will be enough to draw you back for a second time.  This movie can be fun as a one-time mind quest to figure out the conclusion, but once you know the ending, this movie really has very little, if anything to offer."
"JMG-5","5","1","1","15 September 1999"," Music for the masses
","The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that will appeal to the mainstream viewer: nothing in it is shocking, there's nothing particularly menacing about it and everything is wrapped up in a nice, sweet, little package by the end. <br/><br/>The performances by Osment and Collette are excellent but it doesn't make up for the tedious pace of the plot. Two-thirds of the movie deals with exposition which, in this case, is devoted to the interaction between Cole (Osment) and Malcolm (Willis). Cole's got a problem and Malcolm is determined to help him - as his problem is similar to one that another patient of his had whom he couldn't help. The problem is that we already know what Cole's problem is so we're left with an anti-climactic climax. When he tells Malcolm that he sees dead people, there's no shock value or significance. That leaves the resolution to Cole's problem as the focal point of the movie; however, it's so tame it makes you wonder what the big deal was in the first place.<br/><br/>
The movie works best when Cole and his mother (Collette) are together. There's a particular scene at the end when they are in the car that is incredibly touching. The movie breaks down when it tries to be scary, though. There are a few startling scenes but, overall, it's devoid of any real terror. How it was labeled as a horror movie, I'll never understand.<br/><br/>
Overall, it's a pretty decent movie - much better than what Hollywood usually puts out - but, in the end, it's nothing to write home about. In my opinion, of course."
"pahool","5","1","1","11 September 1999"," Mediocre, at best.
","(This might be considered a minor spoiler, I guess.)<br/><br/>Yet another summer 1999 movie that just doesn't live up to it's own hype. This one was not as disappointing as The Matrix, but it's disappointing nonetheless.<br/><br/>Having seen the preview, and hearing that there was a surprise ending, I was able to deduce exactly what it was. As will anyone who spends 10 seconds to think about it. Come on! This one is a no-brainer! Even if you can't puzzle it through before going to see the movie, you get pounded over the head with it enough to figure it out in the first half hour or so.<br/><br/>
Ever since Braveheart won the best picture academy award, I've been convinced that there must be some mind-numbing chemical in the American water supply or something. When the Sixth Sense is called an ""intelligent"" movie by critics, something is very very wrong.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's not an absolutely horrible movie. The acting is passable, and the story is somewhat interesting. The slower pace is admirable in a time when most movies seem to be focused on special effects like exploding tits every thirty seconds, and it worked well toward contributing to the aura of the film.<br/><br/>But the film wasn't really scary. A couple of ""Boo!"" type scenes, but nothing that really got inside me that much. I hate to make the comparison that everyone else seems to be making but I've got to say that ""The Blair Witch Project"" was infinitely more scary and effective.<br/><br/>If you want to see a couple creepy surprise-ending films, go rent ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Angel Heart"" both are much more scary, interesting, and smart, and both deserve your attention much more than ""The Sixth Sense."""

","I find aspects of this story well-conceived, but the film has many loose ends which could have been tied together by enhancing the screenplay and the direction.  I have a theory about the popularity of this and similar movies:  Many people want to know what happens (or what might happen) when life in the human form ends.  As a clairvoyant able to see into different dimensions of reality, I have appreciated various screen presentations of non- ordinary reality.  The essence of this story aligns with what I can see in other dimensions.  But, oh, for more masterful story telling."

","i heard so many great things about this movie. are they kidding? i didn't find it scary at all. the overuse of music to set the eerie mood completely gave away any frightening surprises. the kid was endearing at first, but kept the same expression throughout the film. his dialogue wasn't very believable - what kid tells his mom, ""i'm ready to communicate with you now?"" beyond that, the whole film was built around the surprise ending, which was pretty good; but thinking back on the story, there were too many coincidences which neatly fit together to bring about the ending.  of course, i didn't even have to think back, because the pertinent scenes were all replayed in the montage. what i thought might be a refreshing film turned out to be another piece of hollywood drivel."

Bruce: ""I don't know...""<br/><br/>Give me a break! Come up with something original! The idea of seeing dead people is pretty interesting, and they could've done something cool with it, but instead you get 100 minutes of boring film stock and tired cliches for dialogue and plot movement. The filmmakers even employed the standard ""shocking"" music to get you to jump at the slightest ""gross"" thing, things that weren't even scary.<br/><br/>In the final 2 or 3 minutes, the film pulls itself together and comes up with a completely amazing ending that made me not hate the film. It did, however, make me angry for not hating the film, and left me wishing that I had left in the middle of the movie so I could have been left with a feeling of utter disappointment.<br/><br/>In a summer of movies like American Pie, Blair Witch Project, South Park, Eyes Wide Shut, and Austin Powers 2, maybe I just had too high of expectations.

","The story moved like molasses from the opening title screen on.  I was having trouble staying awake for most of it.  Little and no musical accompaniment didn't help.  There were about 3 'gotchas' when considering the length of the movie, there could have had at least 10.  I figured out the 'surprise' ending less then half way through the film.  The only bright point was the acting in the kid.  A couple of scenes were overacted just a tad, but this little guy is overall a fine actor.  The mother did a good job too in a working-class role.  I did love the shots of Philadelphia.  It was nice to see Bruce Willis without a gun in his hand.  I feel he did an adequate job in his role.  I think the only reason people are raving about it is because he has had so many macho roles that people had typecast him. I think most people liked it because they didn't foresee the ending.  For those of us that did, the movie wasn't nearly as fun.  My recommendation is if you have to see it, wait for it on video."

","Yet another great script idea blurred and ultimately mangled by p**s-poor direction.  I was thrust into skepticism even during the initial shooting sequence.  Was I being too cynical or overly probing when I balked at the New Kid On The Block in the bathroom?  Who sought vengeance on Bruce Willis, the child shrink who ""failed"" him by managing to convince him that the dead people he saw walking around all the time were merely outgrowths of stress sprouting from issues surrounding his parents' divorce?  Who happened, after X years of torment by these wandering spirits, to break into Bruce Willis's house on the very night he was commended by the city for his work with children?  Commended with a plaque shiny enough to have filmed the scene prior almost entirely in its reflective surface?<br/><br/>Maybe I was.  But after numerous scenes in which every line uttered by every character (and I use the term loosely) was so clearly meant to advance the plot (used even more loosely) that a kindly old narrator such as Burl Ives (or his claymation counterpart) might as well have been reading the whole movie off a clipboard, I found it difficult to sustain my disbelief.  Or interest, for that matter.  Yes, there were a few effective (but cheap) scares, and the ending was quite cool.  But hardly a payoff worthy of having to endure a child actor as insistently bad as any I've ever seen, a mother who seemed to be peering at cue cards over her son's shoulder, and the incomprehensible stoicism of poor Bruce Willis, way out of his (fifth) element, rolling out every stupid child psychology trick save pulling a coin from behind the kid's ear (there is a coin trick, though), all of which are inexplicably and immediately effective.  If only it were that easy to pull one over on the audience... oh, wait, it is.  That this film has received so many positive reviews is baffling.<br/><br/>Olivia Williams is very easy on the eyes (but has nothing to work with as obligatory wife-person), and there were some lovely ironies available, notably in the mutual confession scene in the hospital after the kid has his pseudo-seizure, but the film attempts to drive home its points like a careless carpenter with a throbbing thumb.  I'm extremely weary of films that collapse when I pay too much attention to them, and likewise wary of those who suggest that in order to enjoy these films I should not pay so much attention.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."

","The problem I, and everybody else in my party, had with this film, was its' apparent inability to decide what exactly it was trying to do.  Was this a psychological thriller?  Was this a ghost story? Was this a horror film? A scene that featured a young teen with the back of his head blown off as he turns away from the camera seemed to suggest this was a horror/ghost story type of film, but the script verged on more thoughtfullness than that. Pensive performances punctuated this schizo feeling.  The film had dangling story lines throughout - but we all admitted, the twist at the end of the movie salvaged it.  We saw a sneak preview, and the audience, too, seemed to agree with us.  Some fool brought their 7 year old child to the screening, and the kid, seemingly bored out of his mind, started tossing his hat up into the air.  Somebody hollared out, ""If your bored, why don't you leave?"" Uh, nobody said he was bored, but it was a good supposition."
"Mr.Berry","3","1","1","14 August 1999"," Boring with a predictable ending. That's right, predictable!
","Before seeing this movie, I had heard there was a surprise ending.  I knew no more than that and was able to come up with a nice twist ending before seeing the movie.  True to my instincts, this movie ended exactly as I predicted.  Because I had already figured out the ending, the clues in the movie seemed so obvious to me, I wondered why people were not figuring it all out.  But people are surprised are by the ending, and I can't understand why.  This movie might be worthwhile if you can't pick up on clues.  But I could not enjoy it.  Some reviewers say once you see it once, you have to review the movie to understand everything.  Well because I had already guessed the ending, I felt like I had already seen this movie and every scene just led up to an already known end.  I don't know whether to be proud or disappointed.  Proud as in I guessed the ending before seeing the movie or disappointed as in the writers couldn't come up with anything better. I was left with a ""that's it?"" feeling.  So if you already have an idea as to what the ""surprise"" ending is, then do not go see this movie, you're probably right.

Some of the supernatural the child ""sees"" is given without any explanation, like the ""ghosts"" in the story have no other purpose but to frighten the viewer. The film suffers from a short attention span, jumping from one storyline right to the other with no explanation. The film also focuses too heavily on the score; there is a point where Willis and the boy are sitting in a room by themselves for about a half minute, not saying a word, while the film's music is playing at full forte. Had there been an important plot revelation at the time it would have seemed sensible, but the attitude was more like, ""we spent x number of dollars on this score, so we darn better well use it anywhere we can.""<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is genius (which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of one) but by the time I reached it I was so bored and disappointed that it did not have much of an effect on me.

Instead it shows, that good film-making also can be achieved by stuff, producers normally would go mad about - such a movie as ""The 6th Sense"". With no big publicity at all (at least here in Germany) this film started in December last year and went straight to #1, leaving ""block busters"" as Schwarzenegger's ""End of Days"" etc. far, far behind. The story is awesome - M. Night Shyamalan did a great job and the way HOW he tells the story and brings it to the audience reminded me of the perfection of Alfred Hitchcock; even when Cole and Doctor Crowe stand in front of a door with a knob, you just see Cole being mirrored in the metallic surface, although Crowe stands right by his side. And when the plot reveals that Dr. Crowe actually died right at the beginning of the movie and you resume Cole's words of ""I see dead people..."" it makes you shivering although the movie ended - and the impact is even bigger while watching the movie a second time. Its ""silent"" horror combined with a tragic story of both Malcolm and Cole and Willis' and Osment's overwhelming acting makes this film a real masterpiece. Not honored by the Academy at all, it just shows that the movie is too good for the Oscars - it is just not mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted, and with all these points it's no real film for the Academy; normally I see Oscars in important categories as a warning that the film is bad, and once again I have been encouraged to keep this another year; last time it was this lame mainstreamer ""Titanic"" and this time we had ""American Beauty"". Poor Academy! Maybe next time. For me the winner of the Oscar for at least ""Best Film"" and ""Best Supporting Actor"" is ""The 6th Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment."

However, when I began reading reviews about it, I began to reconsider and finally got the courage to see it.  It was a good thing I did, for ""The Sixth Sense"" is really a fine film.<br/><br/>Since everyone by now knows about the film, I will not go into much detail about the plot.  Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who was a great success -- with all but one former patient who later accused him of having failed the patient.  The former patient then shoots Crowe and kills himself.  The sense of failure devastates Crowe and strains his marriage.  So, Crowe decides to help Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment, a boy who reminds him of the former patient.  But Crowe gets more than he bargained for.  Abnormal sychology is little help in this matter, and eventually Crowe must abandon his preconceptions in order to help Cole -- and eventually himself.<br/><br/>The film is great.  True, it may seem slow to some, but it's simply taking its time to create the proper atmosphere.<br/><br/>The actors are what make the film great.  Olivia Williams, as Crowe's wife, does a fine job with what she has.  Toni Collette also does a fine job as Cole's mother, who truly loves her son but does not know what's wrong with him.  Her love is why Cole can't confide in her until the end.  Since I never saw the ""Die Hard"" films, I don't have any preconceptions of Willis as an actor, so I thought he was just fine as Crowe.  His performance was understated, and by the end of the film, you see why it was that way.  And it was a pleasant surprise to see Shakespearean actor Greg Wood as the father of the poisoned girl.  (I'm a Shakespeare nut.)<br/><br/>But the best performance has to come from Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  He was terrific!  That was probably the main reason why the movie was as unnerving and as great as it was.  He really made me feel Cole's terror whenever the ghosts appeared.  He stole the show, and indeed it was best he stole the show, as the movie would've suffered without his acting ability.  I hope he wins the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, as I believe he truly deserves it.<br/><br/>One final note:  the ending is really great!  It explains a lot that might have been confusing to some.<br/><br/>So, I suggest you see ""The Sixth Sense"", even if you have to rent it on video or buy a DVD to do so.  It is really a great film, as its six Oscar nominations indicate."

","""Why-o Earth- did almost everyone think this was a great movie?"" ( warning! spoiler)Come on; with the exception of a few good aspects ( the astonishing end and Osment's performance as Cole ), this was actually a bad movie. Not very bad, but bad!<br/><br/>
First of all, despite the wonderful plot, which is absolutely convenient to make a very spectacular movie, Shyamalan does not seem to have been able to make use of his ""own"" screenplay very cleverly. Consequently, the movie which could have been much more breathtaking became unreasonably boring; indeed boring almost all the time!! While watching the movie, I became so bored that I wondered whether that was the real ""The Sixth Sense"" people were praising all the time! Moreover, I do not approve of Shyamalan's Oscar nomination for the best director; anyone else would have been a nominee due to that wonderful screenplay!<br/><br/>
As for the acting, I liked Osment's  worth-seeing performance, which is one of the few good aspects of this movie.Also, Colliette was outstanding as Cole's mother. But that's all OK with the cast; I especially disliked Bruce Willice's performance as Malcolm Crowe. Actually, he must have played more enthusiastically since he was the leading character. Besides, his face did NOT go with the character of Malcolm Crowe. I am sure that anyone else would have played much better than him. For instance, Robin Williams would have been a perfect choice for this role!<br/><br/>
Finally,the music was VERY poor; so poor that I had not seen any movie the music of which was poorer than this one! So ask yourself; would you have liked the movie if the end had not been so astonishing? A movie should be charming from the beginning to the end; not in the end, only!!! 4/10"
"IndustrialCocoon2020","1","6","15","12 March 2005"," The Beginning of the End (of good horror films)
","Thank you, M. Night, for beginning the trend of PG-13 horror flicks. You know what I mean, the movies that come out every quarter and are gonna be the ""hottest scare fest"" of the season. Of course, It'd be great if we could just leave out the part about this film and it's predecessors choosing to appeal to jumpy amphetamine-laced 13 year old girls that shriek hysterically whenever a loud noise plays on screen. It would be just peachy if the fact that ever since this film, the scare factor of most modern horror films makes Goosebumps look positively horrifying, could be ignored. Unfortunately, it can't. What we have here is a ""modern-horror classic"", and indeed, it has all the makings of one. It brought horror filmaking to a new level, the ""I wonder how many sixth graders will jump when we play that jump sound and something pops up on screen"". It brought the career of rising star ""I see dead people"" to astonishing heights (shudders). It also got studio executive interested in the horror genre again. Too bad the genre become so badly butchered that it's practically unrecognizable. <br/><br/>So, on to the film. The story is about a young boy who can see dead people. It's also about his shrink, who is trying to help the boy get through his ""dillusions"". Of course, as we see right away, the kid really does see dead people, and what follows is the kid wandering around seeing dead people, and the shrink wondering why, until the ""unpredictably and surprising"" twist ending. Ah the twist ending, yet another technique in film that the Sixth Sense transformed from original to clichÃ©. The pacing of the film is repetitive and dull, and the directors laziness when bringing ""scares"" to the screen is appalling. <br/><br/>My score for this film, while abysmal, does not reflect it's production values. The acting, cinematography, and special effects are all top notch. So why such a low score? Well, put simply, this film was responsible for a crumbling away at a fantastic genre; a genre that was called ""horror"" for a reason: it's supposed to be scary.<br/><br/>Enter my feelings on the entire ""PG-13"" genre of horror flicks. The rating limits the possibilities of the filmmaker so much, that fear can never incubate within the viewers mind. It takes disturbing images, characters, mood, and shock, to truly scare most viewers. Simply isolating the ""shock part"", and cutting out the rest may sell a lot of tickets to 13 year olds, but that doesn't convince me that these films are any good. <br/><br/>I understand that, as a filmmaker and fan of the genre itself, I can be a little jaded when it comes to horror. Maybe the reason I thought ""Boogeyman"" sucked was because I'm immune to terror, and that movie really was scary. But for some reason, I doubt that. Good cinema, for me, is about pushing the envelope of human emotion. If it's a romantic comedy, and it's not funny or romantic, it's not a good romantic comedy. And if a horror film is not scary, it defies what the genre is supposed to be. Therefore, as a fan of horror, I am disappointed with this film and the trend of films it started.<br/><br/>In one final note, I would just like to thank Asian cinema for not backing down. Films like Audition and Ju-On continue to push the envelope and create truly terrifying worlds for the viewer. And this is a warning to Sam Raimi. I loved the Evil Dead movies, but if you try to ruin another great Asian film by having it remade, you'll be hearing from me."

","This isn't such a good film.  I think one of the reasons it has achieved such popularity is because critics everywhere decided to write it as being brilliant.  Viewers think they should love it, so they agree to.  I can remember sitting in a theatre several months ago and being very disappointed in this film.  The Blair Witch Project did a lot more for me.  Willis does not do all that great of job in it.  The kid (his name fails me) does. The script was OK.  The directing was actually poor.  I won't give away the end, for the two or three people who have yet to see it, but I will say that the director gives it away by the end of the second act.  When I went to see it, I knew how it would end with about a half hour left.  This disappointed me. The thing was blocked poorly and the camera could have been used more effectively to keep the viewer in the dark.  The thing felt like it was shot before it was really fully conceptualized.  Also, there were many moments where I found myself wanting the film to be more graphic and frightening than it was.  I get the feeling they were aming to get the PG-13 from start to finished.  This hurt the film.Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but disappointing non the less."

Half way through the movie I figured that Malcolm was dead himself, but decided again that it wasn't so. Too many events were contradicting this conclusion. So when in the end Malcolm turned out to be really dead I felt tricked. So I watched the movie back and concluded that this plot was really unrealistic and badly written.<br/><br/>I didn't get the fuss around this movie in the 90's and still don't get it.

","First, let me say, hitting the spoiler alert for this movie is akin to telling you that Soylent Green is people. Secondly, I didn't read every reader comment, but virtually every comment I read raved about the surprise ending. I'm not a smart guy, I assure you. But, I didn't figure the ending out after the first five minutes. I figured it out with two pieces of information - a kid sees dead people and there is a really surprising ending. Think about it. What could that surprise ending be? Hmmm, maybe that the kid is really dreaming? Oh yeah, that would leave the audience enthralled. Maybe he only saw people who were neurotic and thought they were dying? I like that, but it's a bit too sophisticated for Bruce Willis. Could there be any other surprise ending than that Bruce Willis is dead? What made me want to see the picture was to find out how a dead guy can't figure out he's dead. Did the director do such a masterful job that you couldn't go back and catch on? To answer that question...no, it's painfully obvious that Bruce Willis is dead, right from the moment you see him being ignored by everyone around him. I guess the point is that dead people are as dumb as the audiences who go to see films about them. Even if the movie had done a little better job of hiding the fact that Willis is being totally ignored, common sense would tell you that there would have had to be some interaction as he was recovering from his gunshot wounds. And, where was he during his funeral. Okay, I'll admit, I turned the movie off after about 30 minutes. So maybe these issues were dealt with, but I'm willing to bet that even if they were, they weren't dealt with in a very convincing manner. Anyway, I think the movie stunk, or is that stinked. After all, I ain't too bright myself."

But, because of how ridiculously it ended and more so because most of the questions hadn't been answered, and indeed still haven't. Up until 10 minutes from the end it was pretty good. 10 minutes later it had degenerated into a complete farce.<br/><br/>Where do we start?<br/><br/>Are you telling me someone can go 9 months or so without realising they're dead and not a single person speaking to, or even acknowledging him in that time? What has he been doing for food in that time? I guessed this outcome right at the start but then dismissed immediately after as it wouldn't have worked.<br/><br/>Nobody I speak to seems to know for certain whether the child knew Bruce Willis was a ghost. If he did, then why was he not scared of him? What made Bruce so special? and did he not see the patch of blood on his mack? and how come only he can change his clothes and not appear in the state he died in?<br/><br/>
And how come Bruce is able to lob a lump of rock at a shop window or play a tape recording yet all the other ghosts need to attract this kid to do anything. Why could the girl at the funeral not have just put her video tape somewhere where the dad would've seen it?<br/><br/>Ghosts also go nowhere near churches and I thought maybe there might have been a link as to why either Bruce or the kid were particularly special or gifted, despite constant refererences to his past. If you look closely enough, his Wife does acknowledge him at their anniversary, so does the kids mum when he walks in their house.<br/><br/>It does not suprise me The ""Great Unwashed"" of Britain and America consider this an amazing and clever ending. Anyone who has watched an Agatha Christie film would be use to it. Anyone who has watched 'Jonathan Creek' would get endings twice as brilliant and complex as this every week, where everything is resolved."

I also don't understand how Malcolm didn't realize that something was up with him.  ""Hmmmm...I don't talk to anyone and no one talks to me...wonder why?"" All of the ""red"" clues were obvious as well, but not exactly brilliant.<br/><br/>I also don't think this movie had much of a plot.  It just kind of moved along, at a rather boring rate.  I understand that Cole was there to help the dead people, but if that was the whole outcome...why didn't we see him helping more ghosts? Just that one girl.  They could have done a lot more. I was also waiting for more to come of Cole's dad, especially the way Malcolm emphasized it so much in the beginning.<br/><br/>In summary, a thriller which didn't create suspense with a boring and obvious outcome. I think Haley's a good actor and did a great job, but other than that, this movie gives nothing."

","Being involved in the industry and having read so much about this film for several months, I have to say that it is a great disappointment. Bruce Willis was badly miscast. With so many close-ups the part needed an actor with a greater range who can convey tension subtly and convincingly and not the one dimensional comic book action hero looks with the acting ability of a turnip. Bruce Willis trying ever so hard to be restrained is like torture to watch. Even the much-hyped ending is not so difficult to predict. Too many sub-plots with the dead people cropping up here and there with little point except to try and scare the audience - a hand shooting out from under a table - is all old hat.

Once young Cole realizes that he is merely a helper-monkey to the ghosts, he returns to his role in society, becoming popular, and beating out a child actor and schoolmate for the lead in a play. Clumsy and heavy-handed.<br/><br/>The film also contains a surprise ending that may be surprising to some, but seems extremely tacked-on and poorly handled. You can almost see the pitch for this one, ""its like 'Ghost' meets 'Little Man Tate,' with just a little bit of 'Seven's' atmospherics thrown in for color.  Sadly, the film's melange does not live up to even one of its parent films (with the exception of maybe the worst moments of 'Ghost').<br/><br/>This film is a testament to the dullness of the American thriller at the moment. The ghosts in the film are about as terrifying as the homeless people you'd see on a trip to New York, the tone of the film is unjustly gloomy, and the plot is so formulaic that, in instances, you can see its chemical symbols peeking through. See this only if you like cheap sentiment, mild fear, and a heartwarming, stomach-turningly sweet ending. Otherwise, see Blair Witch, which is a better example of of the power of horror."

Well, I couldn't help myself, while watching the film at the cinema, that I have already seen the same film before. I watched a lot of horror and spooky movies, so I realized that THE HAUNTED (1995) had more or less the same story and the same ending. Please watch the original first before you give all the praise to THE SIXTH SENSE. Furthermore, I don't think Bruce Willis is convincing at all as a ""brilliant"" child psychiatrist. The only really good point about this mainstream spooker is Haley Joel Osment. He shows how good child actors, unlike all the Macaulay Culkin's of this world, COULD be. The following film UNBREAKABLE is in my opinion much more tense and thrilling. Rating: 7 out of 10 (if you haven't seen THE HAUNTED) 3 out of 10 (if you have seen THE HAUNTED)"

","The answer: everything. This movie has all the elements that make great movies, classic movies. It has believable characters, phenomenal actors, great directing, and that ending. Oh man, that ending. If only M Night Shyamalan always made movies this good. While he still made some very good movies, notably Signs and the Village, he never again reached the height of The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>One of the things that surprised me most was how good Bruce Willis is. Granted, he was good in Die Hard, but I had pinned him as just an action movie star, not someone who can actually act well. My doubts were all dispelled by this film. And how about Haley Joel Osment? What happened to this kid? This has got to be one of the best child performances I have seen in a movie, bar none.<br/><br/>This movie also has the creep factor, without going over the top. It is chilling, without actually being straight up horror. When young Cole utters that famous line while lying in a hospital bed, it still sends a shiver down my spine. The movie has a certain atmosphere to it that is never broken, from the opening five minutes up through the shocker at the end. This movie is exceptionally dark for a PG-13.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's directing has a fierce relentlessness to it. Even if the rare occasions when not much is happening, there is the constant feeling that something is about to. This is the movie that showed Shyamalan was a genius. I honestly wish he would show this side more often, as opposed to the side that directed Lady in the Water or is directing Avatar: the Last Airbender. That is one movie I know I'm going to miss once it's opens.<br/><br/>If you want a phenomenally well made creepy picture, without having the actual pants scared off you, this is the movie to watch. If you want one of the most well-directed, all- around best movies of all time, look no further. You won't regret it."
"Doylenf","6","2","4","16 September 2006"," Puzzling, absorbing, good twist as the final touch...
","To fully accept the premise of THE SIXTH SENSE, you first have to accept BRICE WILLIS as a prominent child psychologist after seeing him in all those DIE HARD films. He goes from an action star to an intense doctor absorbed with a child patient (HALEY JOEL OSMENT) who claims he can see the dead.<br/><br/>Struggling professionally after a maniacal ex-patient has shot and wounded him in the heat of rage, the psychologist is determined to help Osment from going off the deep end the way his former patient did. That is the crux of the story.<br/><br/>It involves flashbacks, flash forwards and all kinds of camera tricks to keep you guessing how it's all going to end, since the big hype about the film was that it had a twist ending. Well, it was a surprise to me--but now, years later, after seeing so many films of this ilk which are obviously copycat types that deal with ghosts or the supernatural--I'm not so sure I'd be fooled so easily again.<br/><br/>However, a surprise it was for me and it's done so cleverly that you'll want to revisit the film to see just how the trickery was managed.<br/><br/>BRUCE WILLIS cannot quite do away with the smirk he had as the anti-hero in many a film, so I have to reserve some criticism for his performance. But it doesn't matter since the film revolves around the dark secrets and behavior of HALEY JOEL OSMENT, very good child actor who manages to keep the plot believable and interesting.<br/><br/>Absorbing thriller, even if it starts out a little slowly and doesn't really build up its suspense in a taut way. But that ending is clever!"

They might as well have ended the movie with the same absurd outlandishness as the utterly silly movie ""Ghost"" with Patrick Swayze, and just have Bruce Willis hug and kiss his wife goodbye at the end. They already ruined it as a serious, believable horror movie, so why not finish it off in the same ridiculous manner. I mean if Patrick Swayze as a ghost can beat up a fellow with a physical body, and Bruce Willis as a ghost can pick up and throw corporeal objects, why not go all out and just give the movie an ending with the same silly elements they already added in to the movie. At least they would win over people like my elderly mother who would rent it for the silly, ""feel good"" 100% Hollywood ending. As it stands now, mature Horror fans rate this movie closer to ""Ghost"" due to the superfluous inane segments, far away from something more sophisticated like ""Rosemary's Baby"", which treats its subject matter with more seriousness, depth, and overall respect."

","After Shyamalan released THE SIXTH SENSE, the world expected tons from this guy, and that's not weird. Because with the talent of making such a movie as this, you're obviously having a huge knowledge inside movie making, though the three movies he has made later have none challenged this.<br/><br/>We get to know Dr. Malcolm Crowe that's a child psychologist. He's trying to help Cole, a little boy that hides a terrible secret from the rest of the people he knows. His unbalanced mental side makes big problems with his mother that tries helping him out, but soon it's obvious that the only person being able to help Cole, is Malcolm...<br/><br/>The movie shocked when it arrived, not for being extra violent or using more ""f-words"" that usual, this is just such a original, brilliant and story based around a fabulous twist. Bruce Willis stars as Malcolm Crowe in a great way, his truly fine performance of a child psychologist who's failed once and truly can't forgive himself for that - is a character that Willis does in a great way. Haley Joel Osment delivers one of the best child performances of all time, giving such a fright and sense to it all that you just got to be stunned.<br/><br/>THE SIXTH SENSE gives you frightening scenes picked from the best of horror, and also pure humanity scenes with dialog and getting to know the characters in a absolutely wonderful way - and Shyamalan's unique way to mix together freaky horror with human drama, is without doubt one of the thing's that makes this, and all of his movies so interesting, exciting, smart and well made. This movie is his greatest achievement, because it reaches to the drama scene better than any of his other movies - but though shall be said; M. Night Shyamalan is a wonderful director that's delivered the goods on all four / UNBREAKABLE, SIGNS and THE VILLAGE.<br/><br/>Shyamalan also does a cameo as in the rest of his movies.

"krational66","8","0","0","11 May 2020"," It's redemption and release.
","This is by no means a ghost film or thriller in the ordinary sense, as the film critics said: from the beginning of the thriller pattern to turn again and again, the middle of the ghost-haunted and then suddenly turned down into a warm family film, and the last five minutes of the climax to reveal the mystery play, really unexpected. Even moviegoers of many ghost films have to admit that this is the most intriguing.<br/><br/>If your eyes saw the world differently from everyone else's, would you feel stressed? The answer, of course, is yes. A lot of people will bear heavy pressure just because you are not the so-called ""normal"" expected by the family and society, you will not be understood and accepted. The film's protagonist, cole, is faced with such an inherent dilemma. The 8-year-old can see ghosts that are invisible to ordinary people, but no one believes him, including his beloved mother. What I remember most is cole sitting at the kitchen table and his mother asking him why he was moving the counters and drawers. Cole denied it (it was actually his grandmother's ghost) and then her mother snapped and ordered him to leave. At this point in the eyes of cole and also rest, but stubbornly endure, the child should have fear, injustice and helpless... Are very real, let a person not only feel: this child suffered how much should not bear the pain! It was this scene that made me remember the young actor harry Jo osment, who was praised as ""the most famous child star"". His performance is even better than that of many adults.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis's performance in the film is also surprising, the old actor known as ""die hard"" tough guy, this time as the psychologist melcon looks calm and steady, but the heart is surging. He approached cole with a sense of redemption, a sense of guilt for the patients he had failed to care for and the wife he had left behind. He tried to free him, to help him face his fears, to speak to the souls who had come to him... 'perhaps they need your help! Yes, this is the film has been hiding in the deepest foreshadowing. Not only melcon himself, but all the audience did not realize that this was the ultimate redemption of melcon through cole -- who made who? Who was saved by whom? When you see the end, everything suddenly understood, everything has long been in the director's foreshadowing, really clever. It is also the core of the film that transcends other ghost films. He wears the cloak of a ghost, but what he talks about is the communication between people all the time. Although there is a chill, remember the warmth.<br/><br/>Every soul that yearns to be saved, alive or dead, including cole, cole's mother, and melcon, gets the answer they want. Some discover the truth through others, and some discover it by themselves. After all, all the conflicts in the world can be resolved through love. When cole's mother heard the words her son told her grandmother to bring her ""everyday"", she shed a few tears and finally released the knot that had been in her heart for so many years.<br/><br/>Salvation is one of the important Christian teachings, that is, the way of Christ to save the world. In Hebrew, a word with a similar meaning is ""release."" In my opinion, the film deserves praise for its understanding of redemption, ""if you don't believe me, how can you help me?"" Put aside existing prejudice and stubborn, try to understand others, perhaps, is to save yourself!<br/><br/>Even if you've already seen the movie or already know the ending, don't give up on watching it again. He will tell you that the world we see may not be the whole story. What you have always believed is not always true. Right and wrong, normal and heresy, are always relative."

"jayjaycee","9","0","0","10 April 2020"," Shyamalan's touching masterpiece
","""The Sixth Sense"" is a 1999 mystery horror drama directed by M. Night Shyamalan starring Bruce Willis and Hayley Joel Osment. In the wake of having watched ""The Others"" yesterday, I thought I'd stay in the genre and rewatch another chilling classic I consider as an example of excellent writing. Whilst I already knew about the shocking plot twist in the end upon the first time watch (thanks a lot, Doctor Cox!), I was curious about how detailedly MNS constructed his twist in terms of continuity. And man, this film is a sheer balancing act of narration as it's constantly on the brink of giving away its true nature. This is without a doubt the best movie by Shyamalan and he shows his brilliance in everything he handles. He knows to capture the quintessential melancholic nature of his magnificently perceived and superbly enacted feature oh too well. The story he has constructed with this is definitely the best one in his whole filmography. Not only does he wrap up his film properly without letting it become a mess (thank God!), before it gets there it delivers an ingenious range of genres and combines them into something unique. In the beginning, he establishes extremely well elaborated characters the audience sympathize with immediately and puts them into ... a family drama? Absolutely! It's nothing else in the first place. Dr. Crowe deals with marital difficulties all the while trying to follow his job as a child psychologist who wants to help a heavily mentally troubled boy with his problems. Doesn't really sound like a horror film, doesn't it? The best about this plot is how it only slowly introduces the horror into this already convincing drama. Before you actually have the time to realize it, it pulled off a clean genre shift in front of your eyes. I think the shift is done right after Cole speaks his famous ""I see dead people"" quote, as it then continues to narrate the story from his exact point of view. Then you're going to understand the director's true intentions. It's only creepy to a certain degree and solely mildly scary to let you experience Cole's perspective and how he gradually begins to accept his significant role. Speaking of which, the film lives from its child actor performance and gives him most of the responsibility to make this film a hit. Willis might have shown his most versatile performance and Collette is without a doubt gorgeous as always, but no one shines as bright as Hayley Joel Osment. He steals the show from everyone and is the main reason the film developed such a scary atmosphere. The way he hesitantly begins to face his fears is not only impressive, I also thought of it as metaphor. In a supernatural manner it stands for the stages of dealing with mental illness, especially anxiety states and shows how he step by step begins to cope with his disorder. In the end, he didn't only developed perfectly, the audience has also learned something from him and that's unexpectedly great. Oh, before I forget, let's not forget about the phenomenal plot twist in the end. It's such a powerful scene of letting go that didn't really make me cry, but hit me right in the emotionality. The film doesn't really make me feel depressed, it more a positive kind of sadness and melancholy that works its way through the story. Cole went from helpless to helper and taught everyone in this film something about themselves. What else am I supposed to feel? It's heartbreakingly heartwarming, least to say. All in all, this flick is a mystery drama par excellence that sensitively guides the viewer through a well done mix of mystery drama and horror and poses as a parable for facing one's fears, dealing with mental illness and even tackles loss and grief. It's near perfection and MNS's best. Oh, before I forget: Another thing I also wanted to point out is how Cole is designed. Not only do I think that he has some sort of The Shining, to me it also feels like an Shyamalanian origin story of a hero that could easily play in the same universe as the Glass trilogy. I mean, it's not impossible and it took sixteen years for ""Unbreakable"" to get a sequel. I mean, why not?"

His expressions and emotions at such a young age looks amazing. The only flaw i noticed is that the film is slow. It only generates interest from the 2nd half. It also sends us a secret message on child abuse, which was ignored by most of us. Nevertheless, the ending is one of the most beautiful endings i've ever seen.

"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","0","6 April 2020"," The Sixth Sense exploits the helpless afterlife for an extrasensory psychological family drama.
","""I see dead people"", confesses a young and vulnerable Cole. The iconic line of dialogue that surrounds itself with metaphysical delusions, connecting the supernatural with reality. He continues, ""they don't know they're dead"". Ghostly apparitions haunting the streets of Philadelphia, endlessly searching for resolution, realignment and reconciliation. Seemingly, no other soul has this additional sense. Only Cole, an unsociable fragile child whose physical harm and emotion distress fractures the familial bond with his exhausted single mother. Unable to confide in her, he befriends a determined child psychologist, Malcolm. Yearning to rectify the failure from his previous patient whom committed suicide right before his glazed eyes, Malcolm urges Cole to find a purpose for his cursed blessing and enable wandering spirits to achieve absolution. Psychologically mending his fear and the splinted relationship with his mother in the process.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's legendary 90s supernatural thriller is often classified as a horror. Such a description diminishes the psychological exploration at the heart of this family drama, shifting the audience's perception entirely. 'The Sixth Sense', unequivocally, is an accessible insight into loss and deterioration. Loss of life. Deteriorating relationships. Weakened mentalities. A thriller that intelligently exploits esotericism as a plot device to strengthen its characters, almost reaching the adolescent depths of a coming-of-age tale.<br/><br/>Arguably, the central narrative and focus is pinpointed on Cole and Lynn's fatigued bond, personally the highlight of the feature. The rapidly growing intensity as Cole's hauntings increase in severity, alluding to connotations of child abuse, propels both characters to better each other. Accompanied by two outstanding performances from Osment and Collette, whom essentially carry the entire story on their shoulders. Both actors enhance their characterised perspective of the situation, Cole with his frightening ability and Lynn who cannot comprehend her own son's vivid imagination. The exquisitely staged arguments and reluctant embraces become more tense, until their final scene together which just happens to be Shyamalan's most magnificently directed sequence ever. No score. No sound effects. Just a mother and her son understanding each other in a car, providing that much required context for familial strength. Sensational.<br/><br/>Shyamalan surprisingly matches that quality throughout, with several one take sequences and innovative reflection shots to showcase his capabilities to the rest of Hollywood. These technical merits help entice viewers into the unknown, where Shyamalan then inserts his trademark plot twist.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot twist of all twists. One of the most discussed, imitated and influential endings in cinematic history. The conclusive five minutes that would catapult Shyamalan's career into the stratosphere. Despite this being my first viewing, unfortunately Internet culture and general word-of-mouth revealed its twisted nature, undoubtedly lessening its impact. Regardless, the problem 'The Sixth Sense' withholds, is continuity errors. Without revealing the surprise (despite all of you knowing it by now...), certain conditions indicate when a ghost is within the radius of Cole, such as the temperature lowering to freezing capabilities. This condition is completely disregarded for the character the plot twist concerns, as is the absence of blood from the frontal wound. Shyamalan does his best to masquerade these obvious indicators to strengthen the shocking conclusion. Yet, instead of pushing me to exclaim ""oh wow!"", it made me mutter ""hang on, wait a minute..."". These subtle manipulations may seem irrelevant to the overall story, however undeniably places a thinly woven veil of deception over the viewer's eyes by disregarding its own rules.<br/><br/>Due to the upkeep of this twist, the secondary narrative involving Malcolm and the reconciliation with his wife suffered from minimal onscreen chemistry. Willis and Williams were perfectly fine in the feature, yet their purposefully distant characters failed to provide any emotional surge and proved the primary plot as the more investable story. Oh, and only one jump scare was counted, so not bad at all!<br/><br/>It's incredibly simple to understand why 'The Sixth Sense' was popular and successful amongst audiences. Its Hollywood thrills and ominous chills supplied plenty of atmosphere amidst Shyamalan's progressive screenplay. And despite the continuity errors and occasional artificial emotionality, it's one of those rare features that provides two completely different viewing experiences. Supplying myself with a sixth sense for future plot twists!"

","An absolute classic! The story focuses on Cole Sear (an incredible performance by a young Haley Joel Osmont) a boy who is inflicted with constantly seeing paranormal activity. Malcolm Crowe (one of Bruce Willis' best performances) is a child psychologist who takes it upon himself to help Cole and further understand how to help him. It's a really beautifully made mystery thriller; it is wonderfully acted, seriously spooky and intelligently crafted story telling. Although you may very well know the infamous twist ending by now, it's still essential viewing and it requires multiple viewings to find extra details as a lot of the best films do! Toni Colette is fantastic as Cole's mother Lynn; a scene towards the end shared between her and Cole is one of the most beautifully paced and emotional scenes you're likely to see. She portrays the role of the mother of a troubled child extremely well; from the angry to the sick from worry and all the feelings in between. Osmont is just stunning in this; during the suspenseful scenes he is literally shaking from fear and you can't help but feel his pain and want him to feel better. Willis is brilliant; one of those sensitive roles that we have since seen in films like Moonrise Kingdom and Shyamalan's project after this one.... Also a tense and creepy music score by James Newton Howard; cementing a long lasting collaboration between himself and the director!"

"andrewroy-04316","8","0","0","24 December 2019"," The Sixth Sense set a high bar for emotionally driven thrillers with strong endings
","While it's been spoiled to death culturally, it's because The Sixth Sense had such an impactful twist, which has been the benchmark of thrillers since. While there are a couple frustratingly unclear plot points, the broader story, editing, and ending are all excellent. Even before the ending, Shyamalan draws the viewer in by framing it as a character-based story with Malcolm trying to correct for his past mistakes and Cole trying to get through school as the odd kid out. Osment is truly excellent and the best child acting performance I've seen, and Willis is quite good as well. The tension of how Cole will overcome his ""gift"" and how Malcolm will help both Cole and his marriage keep the energy high throughout, but it is the twist that adds layers to the movie and elevates it. There are plenty of hints and allusions to Malcolm being dead, but it's subtle enough in most of the social scenes to be not given away. I realized the twist about halfway through but was still fascinated to see how Cole's gift would be explained - why is he the only one who can see ghosts? I was really disappointed that was totally ignored. I also think it would've been much more plausible to say that the ghosts don't actually interact with the material world, as the suspension of disbelief that ghosts move things around all the time but nobody ever notices is a little tough. I think the idea of having ghosts live a dreamlike existence where they see what they want to see and are only there as long as they need to solve what was left undone in their life was brilliant and is why the twist adds so much depth to Malcolm's character. The hanging people didn't make much sense in this explanation - they don't see what they want to see and they don't have anything they want to solve, but outside of that the other ghosts followed that idea very well. It's fully deserving of its iconic thriller/twist status, and definitely has enough emotional investment in its characters to be more than just a twist based movie."

"angelsim","10","0","0","3 November 2019"," The definition of 'Re-watch Value'
","Straight to the point - this movie is definitely Shyamalan's magnum opus so far - it has everything that you need in a thriller - drama, suspense, emotional relation to all of the main characters, greatly written, amazingly produced - for me this is, no doubt, the movie of the decade (and I have stood behind those words for many years now).
I re-watched it again yesterday and it felt even more touching.
The character of the mother is presented in such a real and relatable way that hardly needs any description: she is a woman that takes care of her kid no matter what whilst taking the role of the father at the same time (presented in the way she calls to the parents of her boy's bullies and firmly telling them to keep them away from her son); nothing in her life really goes her way as she has to juggle between two jobs to take care of her small family and the constant school and social problems of her child; her character is presented in a very memorable way by a very expression-able actress, even coining some catchphrases like: ""look at my face..."" when she is about to say something really comforting - when you hear that you know that you can count on her to do everything that she can for you.
What distinguishes this movie from any generic one is the fact that every character that appears plays an actual role in it and goes through changes - even the teacher is presented in a real-life (psychologically correct) way - while in high school he was made fun of by his peers so he is quick to anger when Cole brings this to light. Near the end he is shown as an adult that has gotten through his anger phase in the past, now relates to the kid and is trying to help him by giving him the role as King Arthur in the play.
Bruce Willis' work needs no comment.
The boy who shot him in the beginning also played his role majestically with his delivery of lines being extremely memorable and hitting a weird and uncomfortable string that gets engraved into the memory of the viewer.
Overall - an amazing performance by the cast and great job of the director leading everything perfectly.
Knowing what you learn after the first viewing and keeping a constant eye for plot holes (which as far as I know don't even exist) during the re-watches definitely gives this movie a lot of value seeing again and again.
What amazes me is how well everything is sewn together - nothing goes well for the main characters, which you feel for, until the very end of the movie where everything seems to get better, which comes as a breath of fresh air after soooo much waiting and hoping.<br/><br/>In my book - one of the movies that I will always recommend to people, no matter what their movie taste usually is - one can not go wrong with watching 'The Sixth Sense'."

Cole(Haley Joel Osment), the kid, proves a worthy selection for his role. Bruce Willis with his calm demeanour as the psychologist is equally convincing. As the story moves towards its last nine minutes and one begins to judge the story, Bruce discovers something, something that changes the entire movie until then, and beyond.

","""The Sixth Sense"" is a completely mesmerizing and artistic piece of filmmaking. Despite having held the record for the highest-grossing horror film ever until ""It"" (2017), ""The Sixth Sense"" doesn't contain many elements of typical horror movies, but still scares audiences to this day due to its eerie atmosphere and unexpected happenings.<br/><br/>The freakiest part of this movie is the ghosts - director M. Night Shyamalan perfects making the viewer fear the ghosts by not actually giving them much on-screen appearances. Of course, the famous twist ending is shocking and unforeseen, and it's mind-blowing how subtlety Shyamalan sets up the twisty climax of the film.<br/><br/>The characters in ""The Sixth Sense"" are unforgettable. Action movie star Bruce Willis nails his performance as gentle child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, and Haley Joel Osment's stellar (and spooky) portrayal of Cole Sear is truly something to behold coming from an eleven-year-old actor. And let us not forget, Donnie Wahlberg's disturbing character Vincent Gray is utterly devastating.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Sixth Sense"" is much, much more than a crowd-pleasing horror movie. It's about the importance of family, and doing the right thing just to help people who need it. It's no surprise that ""The Sixth Sense"" is generally renowned as one of the greatest American films ever made, and I believe that it will forever live up to that standard."

"jacksn-72483","10","0","0","4 August 2019"," Sixth Sense is a creative masterpiece
","The Sixth Sense is a drama/mystery thriller film about a child psychologist who is trying to help a young boy who sees dead people and is constantly being tortured about it. Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcom and Haley Joel Osment plays Cole Sear, the troubled boy in the film. This film is directed by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan. Dr. Malcolm feels the need to help Cole because he feels like he needs to make amends more a wrong that he made earlier in his life. He thinks that if he is able to help Cole overcome his issues then, he will feel better about a past patient that he had failed.
The theme of this film is about regret, pain, and loss. Throughout the movie there are several instances where these theme elements are showcased. When Cole's mother is asking Cole where her family heirloom is that her mother gave to her, Cole wouldn't tell her the actual likely cause of how it got into his room, but he just insists that he didn't take it. This scene really shows how much her mother meant to her. Also, near the end of the movie when Cole tells his mother that the woman died in the accident and then he finally confesses to her that he can see dead people and they talk to him and he does things for them, he tells her how his grandmother wanted her to know that she is proud of her and that she loves her. During this scene, we learn just how much regret that the mother felt because they weren't on good terms when she died. When we find out that Dr. Malcom was dead the whole time, we also realize the loss the regret that his wife feels when she asked him why he left her. This film's theme is similar to that of Shutter Island because of how the characters deal with the inner conflict of fear.
Two techniques that were used to really support the theme was lighting and angles. The scene when Cole finally tells Dr. Malcolm that he sees dead people is very significant because immediately afterwards the camera cuts to Malcolm's face and it slows zooms in on his face. When you're watching it for the first time, chances are that you missed it, but this camera angle is brilliant because it's the director's way of telling us the Malcolm is dead. Another technique that was crucial to the film was the lighting or use of certain colors. In the movie, the director was very careful about how he used the color red. The color red was used to show anything that the dead people had impacted in the film. Some examples of this was Cole's red shirt, the red doorknob, the red jacket on the mother who was keeping her daughter sick, the red stairs, and the red balloon.
This movie was beautifully directed and the attention to detail was just spot on. Unlike many horror films nowadays, this movie was true horror and focused on things that can truly terrify us."

","M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of those movies that can keep you hooked on the screen even when you have seen the film several times, and you already know the big twist. Thanks to that, you can notice some new details, and thanks to that you can see some scenes from a totally different perspective than for the first time. I watched this movie again for over ten years, and I have seen it many times so all the story with its foreshadowing and twists is very familiar. I can say, I know the film by heart. This time I found more interesting how the movie is put together. The haunting atmosphere that is created mostly by what is not shown, or said and the avoidance of the jump scares. There is always something ominous, something threatening beneath. We know it is a ghost story, yet the most unnerving is when we can't see them. And when there is an appearance by one of the deceised, we get a quiet buildup for it. When the ghost is shown it isn't there to scare the audience to jump from their seats. Although, these scenes are quite chilling. What I found fascinating in this supernatural thriller, is the characters and the very human drama between them that itself can offer as many chilling and soul touching moments as the ghost story.<br/><br/>It might not make you cry, but it sure can turn even the toughest guy a little bit softy from the inside."

","The Sixth Sense came out of nowhere and stunned audiences worldwide. It was daring, inventive and had a twist at the end that cemented M Night Shyamalan as a true auteur. He was heralded as being the next Stephen Spielberg but it seems all this went to his head and he peaked too soon because while his next movie was well received it started a long line of increasingly bad movies. But let's only talk of this one.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a young boy who is having trouble in his life because he can, as the movie states, ""see dead people"". Essentially he sees the ghosts of people that have passed on and they still require some kind of action to take place before they're able to leave this world. Enter Bruce Willis playing a psychiatrist who helps the boy come to terms with this ability of his and how to maybe help those that are trapped in this world.<br/><br/>The movie is inventive. It's well done. It's shot nicely and the actors are giving their all. It's truly a great movie that surprised a lot of people when it came out. Not only due to the story but the twist at the end which a lot of people were genuinely surprised at.<br/><br/>However, his follow up to this, ""Unbreakable"", while a decent movie in and of itself is not as good and each movie afterwards got steadily worse. Showing that maybe M Night Shyamalan's work needed some work.<br/><br/>But this one is genuinely good. You should check it out if you haven't already."

","M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is a chilling tale that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats up until the very end. The story mainly revolves around the ideas of the paranormal and supernatural. The movie opens with child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) going up to their bedroom, about to go to sleep. Upon entering the room, Malcolm finds an intruder, who is ex-patient Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), in his bathroom, holding a gun. Vincent is angry at Malcolm for not being able to help him when he was a child. Vincent shoots Malcolm, and then proceeds to shoot himself. The scene then cuts to Malcolm sitting on a bench outside a building looking through some papers from work. 9-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) walks out of a nearby building. When Cole sees Malcolm, he starts to run down the street, away from him. The development of the plot is not at all laggard. The story evolves mostly through dialogue and characters' actions, though there are some exceptions to this. In a scene in the middle of the movie, Cole is lying in a hospital bed, with Malcolm in a chair by his side. Cole is telling the psychologist his secrets, and says ""I see dead people."" Immediately after he says this, the camera cuts to look at Malcolm. Malcolm then asks Cole where he sees dead people. Cole responds with ""Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead."" M. Night Shyamalan uses suspense to keep viewers on edge. Throughout the movie, the characters, especially Cole, know more than the audience. 
The setting of the movie is not typical of horror movies. There is no gothic mansion or castle. The main setting of the movie is in Cole's house, or Malcom's house. The houses are small and modern, not something you would find scary. One of the movie's main themes is finding a purpose in life. After Malcolm strikes a discordant note in his relationship with his wife, he tries to drop Cole as a patient. Cole is upset with Malcolm for giving up on him, and he tries to convince Malcolm to stay. Malcolm realizes that Cole reminds him of Vincent Gray, and he realizes that the only way he can really be happy with himself is to help Cole. At the end of the movie, Cole says he found out a way that Malcolm can fix his relationship with his seemingly churlish wife. Cole tells him to talk to her while she is sleeping, so she no choice but to listen to him. Malcolm goes home to find Anna asleep on the sofa, watching videos of their wedding. He tries to talk to her, but she all she does is mutter, ""why did you leave me?"". Malcolm's wedding ring then falls from Anna's hand. The movie cuts to the beginning scene where Malcolm is shot, and then to the scene where Cole is describing ghosts to him. As Malcolm comes to this horrifying realization, he discovers that he fulfilled his goal in helping Cole, and is ready to move on. The Sixth Sense is a film that keeps the audience in touch with their emotions through its entirety, and highlights the importance of perseverance."

","THE SIXTH SENSE - 1999<br/><br/>Directed by M Night Shyamalan<br/><br/>Starring Bruce Willis & Haley Joel Osment<br/><br/>Plot Overview: Young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is haunted by a dark secret: he is visited by ghosts. Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. He is too afraid to tell anyone about his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something unfathomable.<br/><br/>Let me start of with saying this is definitely a 'good' movie. I imagine it'd be great if only it was not spoiled for me before watching. That is not the film's fault so I can't exactly criticise it for that but I can't rate it higher than my initial reaction to the final product. I am sure I'd like the movie more without the spoiler but, as it stands, it was spoiled for me and I can't give it a 8, 9 or 10 based on a hunch on what my reaction would have been.<br/><br/>Due to that, I will provide critique on other aspects about the film. The story for example. The actual story for the movie is pretty weak, in my opinion. Obviously, it builds to the end and I will say I love the idea of the ending. It all builds to a conclusion and I admire that. I love the hints throughout but I just can't say I was impressed by the STORY whilst knowing the end. Again, not the film's fault but I can't rate it higher based on what I think I would have thought under different circumstances. <br/><br/>Now for things that I actually like about the film. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr Malcolm Crowe and I love the way his character adapts over the course of the movie. Haley Joel Osment gives the most creepy, odd, perfect performance in this film. He was truly exceptional in this role and stole the show for me. Without speaking for extended periods of time, he conveys so much fear, and anxiety, and worry, and sadness with just his face, and that is impressive for an ACTOR to do, never mind just a child. Toni Collete was pretty convincing as Cole's mum.<br/><br/>Both the cinematography and editing were really really good in this movie. Shyamalan relies on building atmosphere and anxiety instead of blatantly using jump scares to incite fear in to the viewer. Why didn't this style of horror carry over from 1999 instead of the style of 'The Blair Witch Project'? This style was so much better and relied on actual SKILLFUL FILM MAKING, not cheap scares and horrific camera work.<br/><br/>As a whole, The Sixth Sense is a very enjoyable movie and I will probably purchase it on Blu Ray. I am confident that if I did not have the film spoiled, I would have liked it so much more than I did. It is for that reason that I can't rate this film any higher and why I will rate this film 7 'DEAD PEOPLE' out of 10. I recommend you see this film regardless if it has been spoiled or not. I imagine you'll at least enjoy it."

","Before I watched this film, I had already known the ending because it is too famous. But I enjoyed this very mush. I had thought this is just a horror movie. However, this contains a lot about family and love. The first murder scene is very breathtaking. Actually Malcolm is dead, but the audience never doubt it because he continues his usual life. So the fact is unknown for every body except for Cole, the boy who can see ghosts. This boy is clue to all of the story. A lot of hints that Malcolm is already dead exists in the film but you cannot notice them at all because the camera-work is so great. When the boy's mother meets Malcolm, they seems to see each other although she actually does not see him. This film is enjoyable as you can get new discoveries every time you watch this. This movie brings up several issues and teaches about how family are. At first Cole's mother cannot believe his words and scolds him, but she finally believes him and is ashamed of her. Malcolm also doubt his wife's affair, but finally notices his death and his wife still loves him. The ending is very painful but great, I think."

","The Sixth Sense is probably my favourite horror movie out there: it's scary, builds atmosphere, has nice plot twists and makes you care for the characters. It's far away from all the jump-scares (there's one or two in the movie), but it relies heavily on suspense. The acting is good, and you can feel the strain that Cole's behaviour has on his family. The story grips you right from the start. It's smartly edited, has good music and the line 'yo no quiero morir' (sp?) has to be one of the scariest movie-lines ever.

","The first thing I did when reviewing this is click the spoiler box. It is so hard to review this without talking about them. This movie is truly amazing, from start to finish. First off, the acting is great. Bruce Willis killed it, as someone who was a traditional action movie actor, who thought he could pull off such a dramatic role like this. And Haley Joel-Osmont, probably the best child performance of all- time. This movie is creepy, dark, depressing, and by the end peaceful and comforting. It truly hits so many emotions. The ending with was superb, maybe the greatest twist ending of all-time. It had context, it added to the story. So many twist endings just reveal something we assumed was true, but serves no difference to the plot of the movie. This ending simply makes sense, and after the reveal you feel almost idiotic for not noticing it (which shows how great the production was). You wonder why Malcolm's wife is so rude, why he is so obsessed with this case, and ""what is Cole talking about when he says they 'walk around like regular people, they don't know they're dead'."" Then WHAM! just like that, ""OMG Malcolm was a ghost the whole time"".

Maybe you could argue, that if they only see what they want, why didn't he see his wedding ring on his finger....OK maybe their are some plot holes.

","I think the only reason this movie doesn't have a sequel is the lack of courage of the producers and maybe the director to make a good one. It was by far the best movie of the genre for many years. I don't think it has ever been beaten by any other. There is ingredients to make a very good sequel. For once, Dr. Malcolm found peace and Cole was able to cope with the other ghosts but the movie left a would cut open: Vincent Gray. He shot Dr. Malcolm and killed himself but then, not only had Dr. Malcolm failed him when he was a kid, his death doesn't help on that.

","The Sixth Sense was M. Night Shyamalan's first directorial debut to the wide open of his career to an extension which has now become shameless regarding the outcome of the films that are usually involved in the genre of action and heavy blockbuster which clearly isn't the precise type of films to write and direct. Nowadays, M. Night Shyamalan's name has become a joke by ruining a famous cartoon Avatar or The Last Airbender in an attempt in making a live action which was a major failure. Addition, after 3 years he has both written and directed a film called After Earth which was a very mediocre-ish bland, dull, and especially a pointlessly boring action flick. However, retracing the films of M. Night's early years of his career it seems in a way that is completely in the opposite of the position that is held by him these days. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense follows a tale of a very young 9-year-old child who is extraordinarily different compared to the fellow kids around his age. When adults think of 9-year-old kids, they are exceedingly cute, and just wanna squeeze their cheeks. However, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) in this film the main protagonist is explicitly the opposite. He is unusually well educated according to the fact that he has no father at home and him only family member he has obtained is his mother named Lynn Sear (Toni Collette). Cole has an extraordinary talent in which he can communicate with ghosts, dead people and he is continually threatened by the unheated beings who he considers wants to drag him to the dread tension and harsh conditions of his life. While he may not be solely correct. In fact, he says ""I see dead people, they want me to do things for themÂ…"" which may lead to a supportive help to a young girl who has passed out from the outcome from his mother as she poisoned her all the way and this shocking event has been leaked to the father of the dead girl. <br/><br/>Aside from the interesting and original plot, the performances are peril excellent. Especially, Cole played by Haley Joel Osment gives one of the best young child performances in cinema history. The role in this film is deeply different regarding other child roles, which requires a subtle, thoughtful, and an immense dramatical act. Haley Joel Osment is fully engaged within the character as he is phenomenal and proves himself to be the most talented child actor from his age group. He has been nominated for an Oscar which is fabulously arduous for most actors and especially the ones from his young age. He is by far the most considerable best aspect of this film that elevates it's heightened of the creation more further. Toni Collette is very realistic and relinquishes a very convincing act of the mother of the threatened son Cole. <br/><br/>The story continues as Cole gets/seeks help from a disheartened child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). Dr. Malcolm Crowe is a sad character who is disheartened by the loss of his wife's caring and love from an incident that happened a few months in which a patient of his previous years visits his estate, and shoots Malcolm a serious one shot through his body which still remains the separation of himself and his wife. It remains a big wound striking his heart and emotions. As he takes on an assignment to help this young child, he assumes the relationship with his wife will improve. Before Bruce Willis's attempt on fetching this role, he was regarded as an action star. People in 1999 though this type of subtle, quiet and passionate role would not fit his vital character. As a result, this stereotype was broken as he committed fully to this quiet, caring, loving role as a child psychiatrist. He is marvelous and astonishingly well acted in terms of this type of role as he was famous for absurd, loud cursing characters. As a fact, he has been supportive to Shyamalan in taking this role seriously as it makes the finest performance within Bruce Willis's career of acting. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is utterly and terrific in the cause of the shocking ending twist added into the film. This film is also well known and praised in terms of the extra addition of the fabulous unpredictable twist that reshapes the understanding of the film as it recalls for repetitive viewings. Personally, I definitely agree as a fact it does not exceedingly cheat its own rules that were set up, and immensely reveals it sudden and quiet making it inspirational and well thought- out. Originally, the screenplay of The Sixth Sense was sold for $ 100 million around Hollywood. Unlike other Shyamalan films, this film is doubtlessly his best work throughout his whole career and a very clever and unquestionably genius filmmaking. The Sixth Sense is one of the most inspirational and a masterpiece of our decade that is precisely original and creates subtle, shocking and peril tension that makes the audiences grip to sweat and tears. This film does have the horror elements but it is more of a light-hearted, quiet drama surrounding the two main protagonists Cole and Malcolm. Lots of meanings expressed by colors and lots of themes to discover and to be analyzed. This is an undoubtedly pure genius filmmaking and the finest work of Shyamalan. <br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","Finally after all these years watched the suspense thriller ""The Sixth Sense"" and I know it's a highly respected film ,yet I for one didn't think it was the best as it's a film with twist that threw me off guard and was tough to find direction. Anyway the story takes place in the city of Philadelphia with Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe an award winning and well thought of psychologist who's assigned to a young man by the name of Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment)who's a timid and confused eight year old boy who's clearly different as he can see things before they happen even seeing dead people. And Cole has a loving and tough single mom(played by Toni Collette)and thru it all this is a journey to learn what haunts the young boy and his life. As the film becomes a work of flashback and future seeing all while trying to throw it's viewer for a loop. I for one left after the viewing as to wonder and ask does the mind really play tricks on people during life, I think that's what ""The Sixth Sense"" tries to prove."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","10 February 2015"," A boy who sees dead people
","""The Sixth Sense"" is a film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and usually seen as his best work. It runs for slightly over 100 minutes. The director also appears himself in the film again just like he usually does. I personally believe, however, that ""Signs"" is still his best work to this day. I have to say I enjoyed the first half of ""The Sixth Sense"" more than the second. It feels more intimate with basically the whole first half (after the shooting) being communications between Willis' and Osment's characters. If you know the final twist, it does not hurt the film at all. It even makes the interaction between Willis' character and his ex-wife more interesting: the Zoloft, her not speaking except ""Happy anniversary!""... I've seen this film two or three times already and I always find something new and intriguing about it. The second half with the play and the interactions between the boy and other dead people did not do so much for me.<br/><br/>The film scored six Academy Award nominations that year. The only one I'm a bit baffled by is Toni Collette's, who I did not find that memorable. And Osment is obviously lead and not supporting. Back in 1999, over 15 years ago, this was the second most successful film of the year at the box office, right behind the newest Star Wars film. I felt the film was at its weakest when it tried to go too much for horror instead of mystery thriller. Most of the dialogs were very well written, so no need to include any of the cheap thrills instead.<br/><br/>Funnily enough, I watched the Witherspoon/Ruffalo comedy ""Just like Heaven"" before ""The Sixth Sense"" and in a way they are both about seeing dead (or almost dead) people. Of course, this one here is much more serious in tone. I recommend it and believe you should have seen it at least once, even if it certainly has more rewatch value than most people will admit, even if you know the final development of Willis' character. (I myself have to say I did not see it coming the first time I watched this movie.) Oh and if you liked Osment's work here, make sure to check out some of his other films. He did not have a career as great as this suggested he could, at least not yet, but he is a talented young actor, just like his sister Emily."

","I have watched this movie later than most of the people did. As a punishment, I knew the twisted ending before I had watched the movie. However, although the idea was decent, there were horrible gaps and inconsistencies in the logic of the movie. Since it is a N. Shyamalan movie, people got used to these gaps and stuff over the years, however sixth sense is one of the firsts and I believe that is the reason for the high score in IMDb. If this movie was in cinemas in 2014 it could not get more than 6 or 7 stars at most.<br/><br/>Anyway, our story is about an child psychologist who was shot in his house by a child whom he was not able to help in the past. It is not a spoiler yet because it is how everything started. Then he continues walking around for almost a year (they say next fall, but it means some time definitely passed), trying to help another little kid who claims to see ""dead people who do not understand that they are dead"". OK, this is also acceptable since it is the basis of many horror stories. Meanwhile his wife is not talking to him, not a word even and we have no idea why. He is the one who got shot, and next scene, wife is not talking to him. <br/><br/>At the end, we understood that he is one of the dead people who is not aware of the situation. OK, I can accept this one as well. But how can they accept us to believe that it makes sense when no one is talking to you??? Your wife is not talking to you, even has not a single emotions towards you. Also in one scene, we see our guy waiting with the mother of the child in a living room for him to get back from school. Really? Not a single word with a foreigner in a room? He asked some questions like ""hello, how are you? I am your child's shrink"" and when she did not reply what happened? He taught that no one speaks with him because he got shot???<br/><br/>In my opinion it was a forced ending. People were diverted from the fact by some scenes that makes no sense at all. For people who watched a thriller like ""The Others"", this movie is full of logic gaps. <br/><br/>If you want to spend some nice time, I suggest this movie. However I believe it is not a master piece or worths anything around 8 stars..."

","Decided to revisit this classic. It was a brand new take on one of the more fundamental themes of the ""scary movie"" family of genres, life after death. M. Night Shyamalan adopted the always reliable Twilight Zone Gothic approach, but set up an all-time reverse twist finale that would have made Rod Serling stand up and applaud.<br/><br/>This could be Bruce Willis's most understated and yet finest performances of his career. No laughing and destroying stuff; instead he approaches his role thoughtfully. It was a new side to him, and he carried himself well. He's a child psychiatrist, with a new patient, Haley Joe Osment, that is filled with angst and makes the claim that dead people are drawn to him like a magnet and talk to him. Osment's performance is emotional and oddly believable. His classic declaration about dead people ""don't know they're dead!"" is one of the best delivered ever.<br/><br/>Ghost visitations are utilized perfectly and just often enough so that every one of them is executed with a dramatic impact and superior fright factor. Low lighting is used almost all the time for a dark, oppressive mood, which fits most of the time. <br/><br/>Now the weaknesses. In retrospect, there are some serious lapses in logic through the course of the story. How could the ""twist"" have been concealed from the protagonist so long, without some character or action revealing the truth to him? The scenes that are meant to address this fail to explain it. There are some very awkwardly slow scenes in the story, and others that just aren't useful. These scenes are constructed to set up the shock value of the final reveal, but most of them are just plain dull.<br/><br/>But overall, this is a fine work, complete with fine performances and an original concept that make for a good, scary ghost story."

","I liked this film up until the final scene, which made me love it. I disagree with many here. I didn't see the clues or hints. I didn't see them at all. It completely came as a shock. And when I watched it again, I saw it in a completely different way. It felt like I had watched not one, but two films. Very rarely does a film this perfect come out. A film that hits everything it wants to and possibly even more. From the bright red coloured objects in high strung moments to the scene where the girl's father finds out that his wife poisoned their daughter, it simply gets everything spot on.<br/><br/>The fear factor isn't what makes this film good. It shouldn't be compared to other horrors. It's trying to send different messages across. It has very few 'jump' scenes and moments that make you feel cold. It is supposed to make you feel for the dead and become understanding. It makes you feel how the boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), feels throughout the movie. And, most importantly, it makes you feel for the doctor, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), in the final scene. It is a very unique, exciting film.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan both writes and directs this nigh perfect film. He makes every scene, every revelation, have the perfect feeling to it. Somehow, he makes us feel how the two main protagonists feel throughout the movie through both the writing and directing. One big problem people seem to have with 'The Sixth Sense' is Malcolm Crowe. People dislike how he could spend years with his wife and not realise that he was dead and she couldn't see him.<br/><br/>If you pay attention, you'll see that he skips through his daily life. He misses certain parts, even days, without realising. A big example is when he can't open the basement door. He reaches for his keys in his pocket, but then he's in the cellar. He never got his keys out, he's supposed to have just appeared there without realising he hadn't opened the door. This happens at other moments in the film, if you look closely. He just appears with Cole or his wife, shifting between the two.<br/><br/>The film really is a masterpiece. You'll probably miss many rules and clues throughout the movie, as I did, so I suggest you watch the special feature 'Rules and Clues' which is very interesting and explains things you miss or problems you think there are when there aren't. Unlike most special features, this film has interesting ones with Shyamalan and the crew, who also did a fantastic job creating the movie. I highly recommend the features nearly as much as I do the film.<br/><br/>Overall, a very nice film made a masterpiece by the final moments. Throughout the entire thing, I felt that Malcolm was helping Cole, but it turns out they were both helping each other, Cole actually helping Malcolm more than Malcolm is Cole. A film that you watch entirely differently a second time around must be one of the greatest. This deserves to be in the Top 100 films, but I'm satisfied with its current placing. It deserves the attention and awards it has got. A true masterpiece."

","This movie isn't just thriller in the modern sense, but it is also a ghost story that is fresh and original, even to this day. It has long been believed that children are better than adults at seeing ghosts; in this movie, that holds true. A small boy (played by Haley Joel Osment) solemnly tells his psychologist, ""I see dead people. They want me to do things for them."" He seems to be correct. <br/><br/>Using an ""as if"" approach to therapy, the psychologist Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) asks Cole (Osment), ""What do you think the dead people are trying to tell you?"" This is an excellent question, seldom asked in ghost stories, where the heroes are usually so egocentric they think the ghosts have gone to all the trouble of appearing simply so they can see them. Cole has some ideas. Crowe wonders whether the ideas aren't sound even if there aren't really ghosts.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis often finds himself in fantasies, action and science fiction films. Perhaps he fits easily into them because he is so down to earth. He rarely seems ridiculous, even when everything else in the screen is absurd because he hardly ever over-acts; he usually plays his characters flat and matter of fact. And in a movie like this, is needs to be played like that because it makes the character of Crowe more believable, and the plot more engaging.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment, his young co-star, is a very good actor in a film where his character possibly has more lines than anyone else. He's in most of the scenes, and he has to act in them--this isn't a role for a cute kid who can stand there and look solemn in reaction shots. There are fairly involved dialogue passages between Willis and Osment that require good timing, reactions and the ability to listen. <br/><br/>I have to admit I was blind-sided by the ending. The solution to many of the film's puzzlements is right there in plain view, and the movie hasn't cheated, but the very boldness of the storytelling carried me right past the crucial hints and right through to the end of the film, where everything takes on an intriguing new dimension. ""The Sixth Sense"" has a kind of calm, sneaky self-confidence that allows it to take us down a strange path, intriguingly."

","In The Sixth Sense, Dr. Malcolm Crowe played by Bruce Willis is sought out by Cole Sears' mother. Cole is played by Haley Joel Osmont and is experiencing visions that are worrying his mother Lynn Sear played by Toni Collette. Cole's visions are those of the dead who do not realize they are actually dead. There is ongoing conflict between if Cole is actually having these visions and if he is what is causing them. With Dr. Crowes passion for work, he and Cole develop a relationship. Crowe at first finds it hard to believe the problems that are affecting Cole, but then realizes there may be similarities between Cole and a former patient of Dr. Crowe's. As Cole opens up to Dr. Crowe and his mother about his visions they slowly start to realize that what he is seeing may be real. Cole has to convince his mother by questioning her about a dance recital she felt her mom did not attend and ultimately provides the answer of her question she would ask while alone at her mother's gravesite. Cole's gift was something that was to help those understand the reasoning of some deaths and to help the restless souls find peace and to give comfort to their loved ones that had unanswered questions. In the birthday party scene, Cole wanders upstairs after seeing a red ballon drift to the ceiling. Cole starts to hear the voices coming from behind the closet door and is stuck in shock. Two children then decide to play a trick on Cole and place him in the closet. Cole is then attacked by the dead character that was stating he ""did not steal the master's horse. In the scene the relevance of color used and camera angles contributed to the significance of the scene. At the point Cole's mother had taken extreme cautiousness in her son's claims of seeing and hearing things. The sound effects used to depict the undead before Cole's entrance into the closet, and the sounds used while in the closet made the scene that much more dramatic. The pain was so horrifying that the screams could be heard over the loud music of the party and attracted not only Cole's mother, but other party goers. The slow motion at the end of the scene where Ms. Sears is pulling Cole out of the closet gives the dramatic effect needed to show the seriousness of the scene and that Cole may actually be telling the truth."

","It's sad that the career of M. Night Shyamalan went so wrong . After the brilliant "" The Sixth sense"" he made great and underrated ""Unbreakable"" and flawed but good ""Signs"". He lost his touch with ""The village"" and every next movie he made was worse and worse. Now his name is some sort of joke and people criticize even his best movies . ""The Sixth sense"" is an object of many attacks with ""overrated"" and ""boring"" being the most popular words from the critics of this movie.<br/><br/>This movie was inspired by episode of TV series ""Are you afraid of the dark ?"" . It's a cross between ""The Exorcist"" and ""Ordinary people"" . It explains why the movie is both really scary and heartbreaking. It relies on imagination and psychology to scare you . It's really scary despite the PG-13 rating. Actually ""SS"" is really a thriller full of many small twists and fantastical finale. Some people say that since the guessed right the finale it means the movie is bad. That's not true (Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is a masterpiece despite rather predictable ending). It is impossible to make a twist totally unpredictable. While I agree that there is a stretch in terms of logic the finale is still incredibly clever – the movie doesn't keep any important facts in secret , it's our point of view that fools us. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise. This movie certainly does.<br/><br/>It works as a thriller , as a horror , but more importantly as a drama. You care about what happens to Cole Sear and Dr. Malcolm Crowe . You want everything to workout for Cole and his mother. There are many heartbreaking scenes in this movie – the broken window in the shop , the talk in the hospital , the talk in the car and the confession from Dr. Crowe to his wife.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis gives an great performance against his macho image , Haley Joel Osment is extraordinary , Toni Collette is underrated for her superb performance , and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg mustn't be forgotten.<br/><br/>The directing by Shyamalan is superb - excellent use of colors , mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoint, psychological tension Screenplay is rich , full of great dialogue and incredibly realistic human interactions . Who could forget the famous ""I see dead people"" line.<br/><br/>Don't listen to critics . Great art defends itself. I give it 9/10."

","After hearing so much hype about it, I decided to watch the movie recently and I was satisfied. I know, everyone spoils the ending, but that doesn't make it bad. Yeah, the pacing is slow, but at no point is it boring. This movie worked on so many levels and I enjoyed the chemistry between Bruce Willis & Haley Joel Osment, which was phenomenal! Just putting it out there before you see it, this is a psychological horror movie, so if you're expecting a gory slasher movie, you'll be incredibly disappointed.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a troubled young boy named Cole, who sees ghosts and is very intelligent. Bruce Willis plays his psychologist named Dr. Crowe and was faced with similar circumstances when a former patient broke into his home, earlier in the story. After making that fatal mistake, he is determined to not screw up again, by closely listening to Cole and helping him through his problems.<br/><br/>Rather than relying on bloody violence and/or constant mutilation, which most horror movies use as their substance, ""The Sixth Sense"" keeps you hooked with its unpredictable twists and deliberate suspense that Shymalan puts on the audience. Watch it for what it is and you'll enjoy it!"

","Though this movie has been out quite a while now, I still feel the need to advise you that there will be spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>What I loved most about this movie didn't even happen the first time I watched it; it happened the second time! Malcolm, in my first viewing, seemed like a good guy who was using Cole as a surrogate for a mistake he made with a previous child. The movie seemed like Malcolm felt if he could help Cole, it would be like helping the previous child he originally ""failed."" And Cole, in my first viewing, seemed like a child with a secret that he did not trust Malcolm with. Then we find out that Cole sees dead people, and that Malcolm had been dead for most of the movie.<br/><br/>That first viewing was incredibly satisfying. Then, some months later, I watched it with a friend who had not yet seen it. And in that second viewing I experienced a whole new movie. Now it was about a ghost unable to accept the failure that cost him his life, and a boy who did not understand why was trying to understand why this ghost was trying to be more helpful than the other ones; and how they each helped the other to come to terms and accept what they were.<br/><br/>Very rarely does a movie give me such an experience, and that is why I have always made it a movie that I have had in VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray."
"alishahmohd","9","0","0","19 November 2013"," A brilliant Psychological Horror film that leaves a HUGE lasting impact...
","The Sixth sense is a psychological horror film starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment in the lead. It is a story about a married and successful award winning child psychologist who finds out that he failed one of his patients, he keeps thinking about this failure and tries to correct it and soon he meets another boy who suffers from the same problem as that failed patient and the doctor decides to help him to redeem himself. That is all I can say without spoiling the actual plot.<br/><br/>In traditional terms, this is not a full fledged horror flick, there are several dramatic and emotional scenes in the movie, elements of the study of human behavior is also involved. It is more of a mix of drama and psychological horror. The horror scenes in the Sixth Sense rely on scary or dangerous looking ghosts and sound effects, now the sound effects do leave an impact but the creepy looking ghosts in films used to scare me when I was a kid, now that I am grown up this doesn't work anymore. That doesn't mean that the great sound effects won't make you feel the chills and some scenes will startle you or shock you for a few moments. Specially if you are watching the film alone in a dark room.<br/><br/>The music in this film is brilliant, I already mentioned the sound effects but the music used for emotional scenes in the movie really helps build up the mood and suits the scenes perfectly. <br/><br/>The acting is absolutely fantastic, Bruce Willis who is best known for action roles in films like the Die Hard Series, performs the role of Dr. Milcolm very well, it is not only shocking to see him fit so well in a role like this but act so well. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job, his facial expressions and delivery just feel so natural, its amazing how he could act so well at such a young age. Toni Colette and Olivia Williams have limited roles but they do good with all the screen time they get.<br/><br/>The movie is deep and leaves you thinking, but it moves at a very slow pace and it may lose the attention of the audience at least in the first half . I also can't help but feel that this film heavily relies on its twist at the end to leave a major lasting impact on the audience rather than leaving that impact as a whole. The twist is excellent and surprising & it definitely adds a whole lot to the plot and the premise of the film as whole. The problem is that The film will only leave a full impact when you watch it for the second time, knowing what the twist at the end will be, only then you will be able to enjoy the Sixth Sense to its fullest and properly comprehend it.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.5/10"

","When I first heard about The Sixth Sense, I imagined a movie that deals with the terrifying side of the paranormal. What I didn't expect was the unusually interesting relationship between a young child and man who are going through troubles in their respective lives. Everyone goes through problems, so it's nice to see people trying to overcome such large ones.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a strictly horror movie, this is not the flick. I'm sure you can find haunted kids in The Shining or Insidious. The Sixth Sense goes beyond the average thriller since it deals with the supernatural and romance (which some may argue are not two entirely independent themes). I must say that I was happily surprised with this movie. It did start quite slowly but built a strong story gradually that really gets emotional. Rarely does a movie combine aspects of such contrast so effectively, but do in part to the solid acting, this movie certainly delivers a unique twist. <br/><br/>All in all, The Sixth Sense was a terrific movie. The whole plot was carefully constructed and managed to turn a common mystery into a life lesson."

","Watching The Sixth Sense for the first time is a seriously creepy experience topped off with one hell of a clever twist. Subsequent viewings might lack the same level of spookiness, and prior knowledge of the ending robs the film of its novelty factor, but hindsight still makes for a very interesting watch: knowing the twist means that the viewer sees the film from a different viewpoint, paying particular attention to the details, thereby driving home what a superb film this is, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan clearly having gone to great pains to ensure that all possible plot-holes can be satisfactorily explained.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, taking a break from his usual tough-guy action roles, is excellent as child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, but the star's thunder is stolen by 11-year old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the child who can see dead people, who puts in an amazingly assured and thoroughly believable performance for one so young. Also making an impression are Toni Collette as Cole's concerned mother Lynn and Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe, Malcolm's wife.<br/><br/>Sadly, M.

","This movie really caught me by surprise! I saw it in a theatre on the big screen when it was first released and only knew that it dealt with the problems of a special young child.<br/><br/>I watched the introductory scenes, trying, as I always do, to absorb all of the clues. In a really good movie, every single thing that is presented--whether it be visual, audio, or implied--is an important piece of the puzzle, especially in stories about mystery and/or the supernatural.<br/><br/>Having seen all of M Night Shyamalan's other movies, I didn't expect very much. Although his ideas are usually quality, somehow the movie versions somehow always seem to fall short on the big screen. But, this particular story really delivered! A visual artist, myself, I am most often able to ""see through"" a developing story line by using the above-mentioned clues presented during the story progression. This was just about the only movie that really fooled me. It was so expertly handled that I simply ""glossed over"" the beginning sequence of events and allowed myself to become swept up by the fairly fast-paced plot and forgot to consider doubt in the general premise of the story.<br/><br/>Excellent acting, especially by Mr. Willis and amazing young Mr. Osment, definitely contributed to the story, as did all other actors, who never once phoned in their performances but, also, did not overplay their roles either, making this unusual story seem quite plausible. The sets, costumes, and even musical score were appropriate and added a real air of authenticity. Great direction and production values also contributed to a fine overall production.<br/><br/>Just about one second before the rest of the audience ""caught on"" to the stunning plot twist near the end of the movie, I almost jumped up out of my chair and screamed, ""I get it! He's.....! Now, it all makes perfect sense!"" <br/><br/>After leaving the theatre, all the way to the back of the parking lot, all I could talk about to my companions was my complete surprise and how this quite remarkable movie production suckered me in at the start and kept me guessing until the final scene!<br/><br/>Enjoy this outstanding movie in the comfort of your own home, without pausing the DVD at any point and let it take you firmly by the hand and move you through the storyline without discussion along the way. I hope you will be as surprised as I was! 9 out of 10!!!"

","Of all the M. Night Shamalyan films that have been made (out of which I've seen five or six) this film (The Sixth Sense) is the only one I liked. Probably because it is the only one with a reasonably consistent plot that has a nice logical (but quirky) ending. All the others are full of loose ends that never come together, are illogical or have endings that are not explained or so contrived that I can only call them 'cop outs'. An example is 'Signs' which ends with a very small alien invasion by creatures intelligent enough to travel from the stars but who cannot figure out how to break into a rickety old barn who get so frustrated that they simply disappear. I suppose they get back into their starship and go home. As to who these alien gents are, where they came from or what they want is never explained and is really unrelated to anything else in the film. Shamalyan's work is very sloppy. What should be clever plot twists or fascinating endings turn out to be foolish tries, very falsely contrived or just too impossible to suspend disbelief. He must think we are all idiots. Guess who I think is the real idiot?"

It gives an interaction between the audience and the plot keeping the viewer thinking. <br/><br/>I believe this is a great movie, with a variety of jaw-dropping moments throughout the movie leaving the audience in a world quite different from their own. In this horror the audience can relate to the characters as it gives a relationship to help interact with the movie and feel what is actually going on. There are also some thrilling scenes in 'The Sixth Sense' is quite frightening with some supernatural creatures that are terrifying to see, but still enough to keep watching the movie. <br/><br/>The young boy, Cole, is considered a freak throughout the film and plays the characters role very well making the audience believe he is a freak as well.

For the rest of the film supernatural experiences happen to the world they both live in and it all becomes a mystery.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, and believe it is an excellent movie for ages 13 years and older.

","This tragic tale of spirits and psychology weaves together in an overall decent film starring 'Die Hard' star Bruce Willis in the role of child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who is shot by a psychotic ex-patient. He recovers soon after and heads back to work on a case involving a little boy who ""sees dead people"" (the boy is played by a young Haley Joel Osment). As the terror increases, Dr. Crowe soon realizes that nothing in his world is as it seems. The director manages to incorporate several terrifying twists such as the film's dramatic climax when Willis' character discovers the truth. However much of the film is cliché with the spirits that pop up to terrify Osment's character and his mother throughout the film. The truly fabulous moments in the film are the opening and closing scenes of the film where the viewer gets the background and the tragic conclusion of this story.

","After a student film and a made for TV film, M. Night Shymalan made his first blockbuster, the Sixth Sense.

While I would consider this to be Shymalan second best film, it doesn't quite match Signs for me personally.<br/><br/>It can be a bit slow at parts, almost pretentious at times. Also, I wish the film had had a bit more comic relief, I know it's a dark story, but it's so depressing that I almost hate watching it at times. Not as bad as Unbreakable but a little bit more comic relief could have helped.<br/><br/>Yes, the twist ending is great, now the twist was actually spoiled for me before I saw the film, but what's great about this movie is that you can go back and watch it and look for clues to find out the twist ending. It's downright scary at times. The acting is fantastic, Haley Joel Osment giving one of the best young child performances in the history of film. And the direction is fantastic. The use of the color red to show when a ghost is near, the great framing of shots, everything is great. And it doesn't explain everything for you, letting you figure out some stuff for yourself.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is a great movie, and easily one of Shymalan's best, it doesn't rank quite as good as Signs, but it's a damn creepy film with great direction and acting."

These are endless questions that could bug you, but you find yourself never asking them whilst the film is on because it's truly gripping.<br/><br/>Willis is as excellent as ever, and the creepy sense of unease you get, is sometimes unbearable. The line 'I see dead people' always brings a tear to my eye, and it's a shame that Osment never really took of, because he is phenomenal in this.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are great, and the film can be very uplifting as well as scary, and this is the high watermark in Shyalamans career.<br/><br/>Close to perfection."

Seeing him I wanted to hug him, protect him from all unrighteousness. Because I do not wanted to see his fearful eyes. Now I want to talk about importance of this movie for film history.

","I don't usually like horror movies, for most of them (at least the newest ones) are more sick and disgusting than scary and intriguing. I was, therefore, a bit skeptical about The Sixth Sense... but the movie paid off. Very few horror films have made me feel like this one... and even fewer ever made me think like this one. That feeling when you watch a movie, and with every scene you become more eager to know what will come next is priceless, and you experience it on this film constantly. If there is anything at all bad to say about M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece, it's that he only made one movie on this level. All of his other works are much inferior, but ""The Sixth Sense"" belongs on the top of horror film ranks, among Kubrick's ""The Shining"", ""Hitchcock's Psycho"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"""

","This movie is about a Dr. Malcolm who is a very successful child psychologist who fails to help one child, an that one child drives Dr.Malcolm to help another child who is like the one he failed to help. Cole, the young child Dr.Malcolm is now set on helping has the same conditions as the child he previously could not help. Dr.Malcolm faces what seems to be a struggling relationship wit his wife due to his obsession of helping Cole. Cole is also facing a similar battle, not being able to communicate with his mother Lynn, who is very concerned for her son.<br/><br/>Courage, fear, and the strength to over come seems to be the main themes during this movie. Granted ""The Sixth Sense"" does a great job of covering not just one, but a variety of major themes during the movie. Such themes can be viewed just about the whole movie as Cole faces his own fears, Lynn also overcomes her fears for her son. Similar to the ""The Haunting"" (1963) this movie deal with the dead and the unknown, and the characters have to adapt in order to overcome their fear in order to be free.<br/><br/>The lighting through out this movie really sets the mood for the scene itself and what potentially could happen. The angles that the director chooses to shoot during this movie really adds to the drama through the film. The different angles that are shot add suspense to certain scenes and in some cases fear is intended for the viewers. Overall ""The Sixth Sense"" is good drama that really get your emotions going and makes you wonder about your own courage, fears, and what you would do to overcome them."

Haley once again gives an outstanding performance. Bruce Willis was his typical very well liked self. The concept of the movie was odd, the plot was different. It does hold your interest very well and it does feel like a complete story. The acting deserves a 10, yet I am all over the place in my mind of what the story should rate, maybe because one person watching it with us didn't like it at all and said so through out the movie. Plenty easy enough to follow with an odd twist, certainly very likable but shy of outstanding. If it sounds like something you might like then it would be a must see."

","The Sixth Sense is by far the best movie M. Night Shyamalan has ever made. Osment's chilling performance is great because it never fully convinces us of the character's moral values. His performance is so cold but so heartwarming. Director Shyamalan fills the film with a moody atmosphere and keeps us pondering about what is going to happen next as the plot twists unfold step by step. It never loses interest even when it starts asking us to be sentimental about the supernatural. A very good film full of powerful plot twists and strong performances alongside great filmmaking. Osment's breakthrough performance makes this his greatest hour."
"aelaycock","Null","0","0","10 October 2011"," Good but not great
","Sorry to disagree with most of the known universe, but I had a few problems with this movie. Firstly, the good things - the plot and the reveal were quite inventive, the photography was superb, and Bruce Willis & Toni Collette were excellent as usual. I'm not so sure about the child actor Haley Joel Osment, to be honest I found him irritating. And Olivia Williams is the quintessential plummy English actress, why on earth did they make her speak in an American accent (or choose an American actress, if this was required)? My biggest issue is all the padding which seems to go with these psychological chillers. There is not a huge amount of action, we spend a lot of time gazing soulfully into people's eyes while moody music plays to illustrate the troubled theme. The boy states that he sees dead people ""all the time"". Unfortunately, we don't. We get a fleeting glimpse of about five dead people. The movie could have been so much better, with some really frightening scenes, and a tense build up to the finale (as in ""The shining"", a superior movie in every respect). Instead, all the tension is released long before the end, which comes as a let down. There could have been more development of some minor characters like the teacher, or the people at the funeral. A great opportunity missed, in my view."

","The rampant notion that horror means something that makes you pee your pants is grossly misinterpreted. Horror does not necessarily mean ghosts, possessions or exorcisms. Horror is a feeling that eats you from inside and conveys that something is extremely wrong. It doesn't need to make you jump in your seat. It is meant to last long after you are done with the movie; an unpleasant memento you carry with you. Horror exploits your worst fears. It frightens you of dark corners, unknown noises and invisible things behind your back. This is also what The Sixth Sense does.<br/><br/>The movie begins on a rather happy note. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a content man. He is married to the woman he loves, is a reputed child psychologist and has won the Mayor's citation for professional excellence. The happiness doesn't last. An old patient shows up; a man the doctor had failed. He is scared, angry and troubled. Before the doctor can reason with him, the man shoots him and blows his own brains out. Next fall. The doctor is sitting on a bench, overlooking a child - his next patient. It is the second time he is handling such a case. Having failed the first time, he believes he will be forgiven for his past mistakes if he gets this one right. This is his chance at redemption.<br/><br/>However, the kid, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) steals the show. The movie is centered around him and his problem in life. Everyone has a predictable reaction, one of disbelief. His mother, the doctor, and other children - everyone is skeptical. At a tender age, with his frightening inconvenience (the trailers reveal what it is. I won't. It would be an injustice), Cole is cast alone into the horrifying world, especially so for him. Harry Osment plays this role sublimely. You can notice fear in his prepubescent feminine voice, in his movements and on his face. Osment gives one of the best child-performances I have seen. His acting is nonchalant, yet brilliant. He even outdoes Bruce Willis with his performance, something that is truly commendable.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis looks pale in comparison to Osment. This isn't anything wrong with his acting, but it just appears feeble. He makes a good child psychologist and Cole's only companion, along with dealing his own troubled married life. But he does seem out of place at times in a non- action movie. Maybe we have grown just too accustomed to seeing him save the world as John McClane. <br/><br/>The movie has been shot in dim light, which speaks of the gloom and melancholiness prevalent in the film. The foreboding atmosphere is one of the factors adding to the horrors of this film. The tension too has been built up really well. It grips you, engulfs you, before shocking you.<br/><br/>Relationships have been portrayed in a beautiful manner. The mother-son relation between Cole and his mother is touching. She does her best to make Cole lead a normal life. Yet at times, she loses control, skeptical and tired of Cole's problem. Cole doesn't bother her with it. Without a father, he understands the situation they are in and the difficulties their two-member family is facing. He does not want to add to it.<br/><br/>The relationship between Dr. Crowe and wife too plays an important role. Initially things are good, but as Dr. Crowe gets overwhelmed with his new case, they begin drifting apart, or so it seems. He tries bringing it back together but fails repeatedly. She does not talk to him, celebrates their anniversary alone and also seems to be seeing a new guy, with Dr. Crowe watching all this helplessly. Watch over this closely, for the end to be even more rewarding.<br/><br/>However, easily the most effective relationship is that between Dr. Crowe and Cole; the former a middle-aged man, the latter just an innocent child. The contrast between them is clearly visible through a single dialogue exchange:<br/><br/>Dr. Crowe: You are not a freak. Okay? Don't you believe anybody that tries to convince you of that. That's bullshit. You don't have to go through your life believing that. Okay? Cole: You said the 'S' word.<br/><br/>Yet, he is Cole's only hope, the only person who even tries to understand him. Despite his troubled married life, he gives attention to Cole. And that is what is so wonderful about it. It can be best summed up in the words of Cole himself, when he says with tears in his blue eyes 'Don't fail me. Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.'<br/><br/>The build-up of the movie is thoroughly gripping. Though it appears to be proceeding rather slowly, it adds to the depth of the film, letting you ponder as it moves. The film seems rather hurriedly wrapped up towards the latter part. But the absolute end is sheer genius. The Sixth Sense has given birth to one of the most iconic endings ever in Hollywood. That is the cherry on the cake."

They took ages to say things or do things, like in the scene where the boy gives the father at the funeral the tape.<br/><br/>The acting of course is brilliant, you can't help but love the strange boy. He seems so innocent yet all the time is seeing these horrible things that come across quite scarily when you don't understand what's going on initially. Bruce Willis is good but I feel sometimes all he does is whisper and look depressed. I suppose that is his role but he could have put a bit more presence into it.<br/><br/>At for the plot it's great but takes a while to get going. The huge twist at the end I never saw coming because of the way they carefully interwove Willis' character into scenes. I never suspected it for one moment. So yeah, atmosphere but not much else."

A child psychologist by the name of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) meets with Cole and Malcolm soon realizes that Cole has the same characteristic traits as Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg) a previous patient of Malcolm's who shot him while he was retuning from a night out with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). Learning from his past experiences with Vincent, Malcolm made a promise to himself to not make the same mistakes with Cole. It took some time for Cole to trust Malcolm, and when we finally did he shared his deepest darkest secret. He can see dead peoples.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense displays some very strong themes. The first being ""Afterlife,"" which is a topic everyone have difference of opinions on, but in the movie you will see ghost appearing to Cole, the reasoning behind ghost as many of us believe is having unfinished business, and the only way to move on is for the business to be completed. At first Cole was terrified of the ghosts, not understanding what they wanted from him, but Cole gained ""Courage"" which is another theme in the movie, he decided one night to speak with one and finds out what it wanted and began to help.<br/><br/>The lightening of the film is very dull and dim, and color of The Sixth Sense is very dim, no actual coloring used in the movie except for the church scenes, you can see a few hints of red on the Jesus icon as well as the candles, and what's also interesting is majority of the movie is taking place at night, to reinforce that gloomy feel.<br/><br/>""I see dead people. They don't know they're dead. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see."" (Mercer, 1999). Is a pretty powerful statement, and just going off that statement alone without watching the movie, how do I know I'm not dead? I know it's a crazy question, but think about it.<br/><br/>According to the movie your ""Afterlife"" is what you make it, here you see Malcolm throughout the entire movie believing he's still married to Anna, doing his same daily routine activities, just living ""life"" and it took a boy to tell him that hey man, your dead. But my only question is, if ghost exist due to unfinished business, what was Malcolm's unfinished business?"
"KnightsofNi11","8","0","0","2 February 2011"," Shyamalan introduces himself to the world with a bang
","In 1999 director M. Night Shyamalan introduced himself unto the world with The Sixth Sense. With this film we were introduced to Shyamalan's twisted, dark, and yet highly creative mind. We got a taste of his skilled storytelling ability wrapped in his tight artistic direction. We also discovered the man's knack for twist endings. And what a twist it was. The Sixth Sense really focuses on two characters and their relationship. One is Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who is a psychiatrist whose current patient is a disturbed little boy named Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Crowe makes it his mission to help this boy, while at the same time he is trying to cope with his deteriorating personal life. It's emotional, thrilling, disturbing, and beautiful all at the same time. It's really not like anything you've ever seen before.<br/><br/>Now sadly, I already knew about the shocking twist ending going into this film. You can't talk about movies for seventeen years without someone spilling the beans. But that didn't make the film any less enjoyable. The movie is great without the twist, but the twist and the end really adds a whole new level to the film. It changes the face of the film and when you get right down to it, it's what makes the film so unforgettable. That and the famous, ""I see dead people,"" line. However, everything else in the film's story is great. It is something so unique and haunting that it really gives this film a different feel than most horror or thriller films. The film is also paced very well in the most somber and low key way. This movie has a hypnotic quality to it. The emotional prowess of the film mixed with some very chilling moments sets it apart from anything else.<br/><br/>One thing so remarkable about the film is the great equality in talent of the two leads, despite the age difference. Bruce Willis is as good as ever in this film. His quiet, somber attitude gives the film its mysterious feel. Eleven year old Haley Joel Osment drives the emotion of the film and puts forth an astounding performance. His character and his performance isn't a typical child actor role. His character is a very strange one with a wide range of personalities as well as maturity levels. He is undoubtedly a kid but there is much more to him than meets the eye. Toni Collette plays his mother who is another very important character and her performance doesn't quite reach the levels of Willis and Osment, but is very good nonetheless.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film I began feeling like it wasn't really going anywhere. I sort of began to forget the goals of the characters in the film and I felt like it was losing its footing. But as these feelings began to escalate the twist occurred and the film ended, leaving me very satisfied. I can't help but wish that there would have been a little more clear cut direction towards the end of this otherwise great film. There is also a lack of resolution in the film. It isn't something I hated, but I couldn't help but notice. The film feels like it is lacking a well rounded ending until the twist. And while the twist is remarkable and it ends the film very strong, it doesn't account for everything. The Sixth Sense got a little bit tripped up towards the end, but not enough to ruin everything else great about the film.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is a very different kind of film and I was very happy with it. It is unlike anything I've ever seen. The look and feel of the film doesn't line up with the subject matter, but not in a bad way. A movie about a disturbed little boy who sees dead people could have easily been a cheesy slasher with corny lines and characters. But instead Shyamalan made it into something much more sophisticated and beautiful. This isn't a loud and action packed film. It's something much different, and much better. I was very impressed by The Sixth Sense."

","The Sixth Sense, was, as I first thought, a ghost story, but I was wrong; the movie is centered around human morals and emotions. Throughout the movie, there are only a few scenes that could be said as 'scary', however for the most part, the audience, is skillfully directed between the dialogue and emotions from Dr. Malcolm Crow and Cole Sear. The film for the most part is delicately restrained, and at times when the film climaxes it could have turned into a blood fest, however M. Night Shyamalan skillfully restrained this. Shyamalan creates a wonderfully dark yet surreal setting to the movie, introducing the relationship and trust between Dr. Malcolm Crow and Cole Sear developing at a realistic pace.<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie was that apart from several scenes, there were barely any scenes that were horrifying, but instead, Shyamalan focuses the film instead on the dialogue between Malcolm and Cole. The film, moves at a slow, steady pace - just enough for the audience to totally absorb what's happening, and want another scene. The movie has stellar acting by Bruce Willis (as the slightly depressed child psychiatrist) who played his role perfectly. Another stellar performance was by Haley J. Osment, as his role of Cole. His maturity for the role, and well delivered lines are a far contrast from the typical whiny/annoying kids who act now - the line between cute and funny, to whiny and annoying is now very, very small.<br/><br/>This film, which moves at a steady pace, will be extremely rewarding to anyone who wants to wait the one hour fifty minute duration time. The main story and the ending were well written, and acted. This film highlights a beautiful haunting score, by James Newton Howard, brilliant directing and a magnificent script by Shyalaman.

By doing this, his wife becomes depressed over his absence, (or at least thats what he thinks) which causes him to decide between helping the kid, or his wife.<br/><br/>The story itself is excellent, opening with a bone chilling scene. Not to mention a surprising ending that will leave you haunted for days. The acting performances are phenomenal, mostly Osment, who received an Oscar nomination. Also includes Toni Collete, Olivia Williams, and a cameo of Shyamalan as a doctor. The music by James Newton Howard gave me goosebumps for the whole movie. One of his best scores ever in my opinion. Unlike Ghost, which is a little similar, this one doesn't have crappy effects thrown in it, but rather suspenseful situations based on sense, given this movie's title.<br/><br/>This film couldn't have been any better. Everything work perfectly. The only reason for not a 9 or 10 is simply based on movie type. But all together this film was excellent."

","The Sixth Sense was the film that sky-rocketed M. Night Shyamalan's career and well, he hasn't been able to escape it since. Before hand he had made 2 films; Praying with Anger which it was rumoured that Shyamalan tried to suppress it's existence like Stanley Kubrick did with Fear and Desire; and Wide Awake, a family comedy that was a commercial flop. He also helped write Stuart Little before his big break came with The Sixth Sense, at the young age of 29.<br/><br/>Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a successful and rewarded child psychologist, but suffers guilt about a former patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) who breaks into his house. The next year Crowe wants to do right when he works with a 9-year-old boy Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who suffers from the same symptoms. Both have major problems, Crowe is distance to his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) whilst Cole's mother Lynn (Toni Collette) does not know how to deal with her son who is anxious, isolated and considered a freak by other school children. But Cole's biggest problem is that he can see ghost who have suffer some of the most horrific injuries and harm the small boy, making him life of fear. Both psychologist and patient needs to face up to their demons.<br/><br/>Shyamalan show he was once a writer/director of great skill and both a great supernatural thriller and a horror film. Shyamalan makes a dark tone and lit film with brilliant camera work: Shyamalan loves using single take shots with the camera either following people or moving around the room to give the film an unbroken, organic feel. It's a skill other great like Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Darren Aronofsky and Alfonso Cuaron, so it is of course good enough Shyamalan. Shyamalan also blends together the supernatural element of ghosts with how people from the real world would deal with it, from a scared young boy and how to it damages his psychology, to school children who see him as a freak, to a psychologist who does not believe him. There are also real world issues involving crumbling marriages, bullying and a mother-son relationship. Shyamalan also delivers on effective on horror, from the psychological fear from a character we can care about to subtle scares involving ghosts running in the background. With Shyamalan's camera work and tone The Sixth Sense is better then most horror films.<br/><br/>There is a great cast and they work with a terrific script. There are characters you can sink your teeth into. Willis shows he is more then an action star but also a serious actor and gave a good performance. Osment showed that at the time he was one of the best child actors around for his time. He gave a sincere, believable performance as a scared child and was deserving of an Oscar nod. But he was a weird kid. The actresses of the film were also good, both being very real in their performances.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense has an excellent, well thought out script with great ideas about people, family and the dark afterlife. This is clearly Shyamalan's best film and his career has been going downfall ever since. Unbreakable and Signs are still good films but he hasn't made a good film since."

","Ironically, I have viewed The Sixth Sense for the first time exactly 11 years after it opened. I remember distinctly when it was first released and the amount of buzz and tension it caused those who saw it. Unfortunately, I was not one of them but I am certainly glad that I have gotten to it now.<br/><br/>In many ways, this has become a film of iconic proportions. Only saying the words, ""I see dead people,"" gets a response out of most people. This film is also one of the reasons Bruce Willis is a star and the reason Haley Joel Osment is a household name. Beyond all that however, what it really comes down to is the potential shown by this film for a newcomer named M. Night Shyamalan, who might be today the most hated director in Hollywood. The reason for that is because he showed such talent and poise both in writing and directing and to see such marvelous talent go to waste on projects such as Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender is the true disappointment.<br/><br/>Without going into details, I must say to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet (and there are probably few), that this is filmmaking of the highest order. Shyamalan here shows impeccable timing and great ability to use editing, lighting and an incredible score by James Newton Howard to create true and genuine suspense and terror in multiple scenes. Knowing the major plot twist only because I have lived in America for the last ten years, I was still drawn into the story due to the emotional content involving Malcolm Crowe and his wife as well as the relationship between Cole and his mother. The most tantalizing scenes are when things happen to Cole and it is remarkable how Shyamalan stages and crafts each and every frame.<br/><br/>So, ten years later we find Shyamalan with five more films under his belt with only two being well-received and the rest either panned or hated soon after. Is he still a talented filmmaker. I believe so but it is astonishing to see his descent since and one can't help but wonder what went wrong. I don't know but something did and I pray and hope that somehow, someway, Shyamalan will find his way back to the type of material and style he used to make this such a great film."

","Regarding the famous twist ending of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999), I will try to be coy here for the benefit of those who have just come out of a decadelong coma, and for those Korowai tribesmen of New Guinea and the Munduruku dwellers on the Amazon who may be unaware of it, but who may be reading this posting on their BlackBerrys (and in today's modern world, who knows?!?). For all first-timers (like me) who see the film fully aware of the picture's startling denouement, the question must be ""Can one still enjoy it with such a movie-spoiling foreknowledge?"" Well, as anyone who has ever seen ""The Sixth Sense"" more than once knows (and I can't imagine anyone seeing this film for the first time who would NOT want to watch it again immediately!), the answer is a resounding ""yes."" In it, Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philly who attempts to help 9-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's problem, as he famously puts it, is that he sees ""dead people."" Anyway, the always likable Willis gives a nicely restrained performance here and, as ""DVD Delirium"" puts it, ""manages to keep his trademark smirk hidden."" And young Haley Joel Osment is superb as the troubled Cole, effectively communicating, with his whispered delivery, the fear that is his daily bread. The film is a quiet and understated affair, building suspense and scares through a gradual accretion of detail. It has been expertly lensed by master cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, and Shyamalan's direction is quite ingenious in the way it skips around the edges of the film's big twist while still playing the game fairly. By that famous ending, young Cole seems set to beat Jennifer Love to the punch as a ""ghost whisperer,"" while Malcolm comes to see himself for what he truly is. It's some brilliant stuff, and I for one wouldn't even mind a belated, latter-day sequel...."

When they venture upstairs, they are met by a man who has broken into their home in the hopes that his former doctor will finally help him. Malcolm realizes too late that the man is Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) when Grey pulls out a gun and shoots Malcolm in the torso.<br/><br/>The film flashes forward to show that Malcolm is trying to rectify his mistake with Vincent by helping Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole initially doesn't want help from Crowe, but reluctantly allows him to help. After Malcolm learns that Cole can see ghosts, Malcolm figures out that Cole needs to help them. Malcolm is clearly having issues with Anna, she seems to ignore Malcolm at every turn.<br/><br/>When Cole helps a girl (Mischa Barton) tell her father that her mother killed her, Cole gains the courage to tell his mom of his gift - his curse. The confession brings them closer together and Malcolm realizes that he's done what he set out to do and doesn't need to stick around anymore.<br/><br/>Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, it's the first big blockbuster in a large list for him that ends up being one of the greatest films of all time. The choice of Haley and Bruce to star was an excellent choice and I can think of no two actors to replace them, even if there could be a remake in the future. Psychologically, the film gets under your skin and visually it chills you to the bone. I remember the first time I saw the movie, I was freaked out for days after viewing it.<br/><br/>The visual and special effects are phenomenal and the thrills that the movie gives you are not in the same league as to what the scares and the chilling twist gives you.

","So you wanna know who's responsible for the disgusting glut of weak-ass, PG-13-rated bundles of porcine fecal matter trying to pass themselves off as 'horror movies?' Well, folks, just blame M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>No, let me take that back...Let's not blame 'Night', but the sorry excuses for writers, producers and directors who called themselves attempting to surpass the brilliance of Shyamalan's best movie so far...THE SIXTH SENSE.<br/><br/>With a smooth effortlessness that's just about as terrifying as the movie itself, Shyamalan brings us the damn-near perfect story of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis in a role that shattered everyone's prejudices about him as an actor), a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients (an almost unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg), who then commits suicide. Sometime after this ordeal, feeling that he failed his late charge, Malcolm attempts to find redemption by helping out a distressed young boy named Cole Sear, (Haley Joel Osment's career-making performance). who can ""see"" dead people and communicate with them.<br/><br/>At no time are you ever unaware of how much you care for these characters, and how extreme the situation is for them, which makes the shocks and scares twice as intense as any you could ever find in a PG-13-rated flick before, (except maybe for POLTERGEIST.) Plus there are fantastic performances all the way round by Willis and Osment, backed up by great turns by Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Cole's tough- but-tender mom) and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's former fiancée.<br/><br/>Even after multiple viewings, the storytelling skill that Shyamalan has is faultless, and still leaves you scratching your head as to how you could've missed the clues that lead to one of the most spellbinding, jaw-dropping endings to come along in many moons. Some people might figure it out in the first five minutes, but I will confess - Night so thoroughly pulled me into his world, that I wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>SENSE was both a blessing and a curse to Shyamalan, since newly-won fans now expected ALL of his movies to have that tricky ""twist"" ending to stun and surprise them. Because of that, the quality of the movies that followed SENSE was inconsistent to say the least. People still debate about the merits of UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, or even if THE VILLAGE should've been made at all.<br/><br/>Personally, I like everything he's done since, flaws and all. But as far as his career is concerned, THE SIXTH SENSE is like his ""CITIZEN KANE,"" and considering the genre, is every bit as monumentally good as Orson Welles' towering achievement.<br/><br/>THE SIXTH SENSE is without a doubt a ""must-have"" for your DVD library."

The experienced viewer can resolve the ending before it happens, only if he is analyzing instead of enjoying and even though it thrills you. The movie's success relies on a seriously developed plot that considers actual life experience and its relation with the supernatural (understand as common things that can happen to anyone).

","""The Sixth Sense"" is a powerful movie starring Bruce Willis as a damaged child psychologist attempting to treat a young misfit played by Haley Joel Osment.

Crowe has his own internal misgivings for his wife is painfully estranged and appears to ignore his very existence. Cole's mother is unsettled by injuries and events that the child says are caused by ghosts. This film also contains a secret within its finely tailored plot that contributed to its huge mass and critical appeal. When I watch this film , I too get caught up in trying to have its secret revealed to me visually and/or verbally. But the ""gimmick"" or secret is so exquisitely crafted that its divulgence comes as a complete surprise chiefly because the writing and the acting are wonderfully first rate. The play upon our human vulnerabilities such as death, loneliness, fear and separation glues us to this ""ghost"" story. Although we may not trust nor agree with Shyamalan's ideas, this film will capture those who see it as a plausible, nonsecular representation of death and the afterlife.

I was totally stunned.<br/><br/>While it can be compared to the archetypal horror film because of some of its arguably shoddy scares, the denouement gives it a totally different, much greater magnitude that sets it apart from all mediocre Hollywood horror movies. It meant something more special to me because I didn't go as far as interrogating why Malcolm Crowe was being ignored by his wife and went ahead and assumed that they had a bad breakup or something! The ending gave it all clarity, and it was a darn good twist. It left my mouth hanging open for a few minutes. My friends and I were like, ""Are you? Oh my"" It was great.

When he sees his wife in an apparently compromising situation he takes his anger out by destroying the shop window.<br/><br/>Yet he genuinely loves his wife and is nearly distraught by her behavior both by her apparent lack of interest in him and her actions (locking the basement door, pulling the check away just as he reaches for it).<br/><br/>Even Angelica Tom, who plays Kyra's disturbed and dangerous mother does a good job in her short time on the screen.<br/><br/>Having filmed what is probably one of the greatest ghost stories ever written, Director Shyamalan appears briefly (as the doctor who treats Cole), as he does in all his films, as a tribute to his idol the late Alfred J. Hitchcock. If you are a fan of ghost movies, this is one you should not miss.<br/><br/>I also recommend you see ALL of M. Night Shyamalan's other films.

Much of the terror and fright wasn't exactly up to snuff, but the overall drama and presentation was irresistible. Leading up to an ending that can take you by surprise, relating to events that happen throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Great directing, good acting, great story, give the Sixth Sense .... 8.5 out of 10"

","I rented this and watched it around midnight a couple years ago. This film, like ""Poltergeist,"" has contributed a line to the eternal world of cinema: ""I see dead people."" I will not spoil this for someone that has not seen it. My comments are on the craftsmanship that is this film. It starts with Haley Joel Osment, who will go down as one of our great child actors. He has the vulnerability and pain that expresses itself so well. His continual bouts with his ""gift"" bring him more pain. He gets an ally in Bruce Willis's character, and they begin to face things together. Unfortunately, like most movies that present something supernatural, a set of rules apply to the world and it these rules that make it fairly easy to pull this down. However, I would rather have them craft it as best they can than try to keep consistent in every aspect. Like ""Memento"" which I saw pretty close to the same time, I don't want to think too much or the fine fabric of the film starts to unravel. How's that for cowardice?"

","The power of the Sixth Sense lies on its critics. The rush of so many people to ascertain they had got it, shows how brilliant the script and the direction was. When the credits rolled we all felt fooled by Shyamalan, we all thought there must have been a flaw we haven't noticed. But no, the story is flawless, the hints were there and everything does make sense in the end. Basically, it's so intelligently made it's intimidating, hence the reaction. Shyamalan doesn't fool you, he simply outsmarts you. To paraphrase a quote from the movie, he makes you see only what he wants you to see. This is why you have to watch this film at least twice in order to appreciate how masterfully crafted it is.<br/><br/>Now the acting. A movie can take pride if one of the leads throws an exceptional performance. When you have two magnificent, Oscar caliber performances, what more can you really ask from your actors. This is both Bruce Willis' and Haley Joel Osment's best role to date. And it makes the Sixth Sense the only movie after Leon that the adult/child relationship really works.<br/><br/>Let me finish by saying that I consider a major spoiler even the title Sixth Sense. In order to truly enjoy this movie, you shouldn't know it has anything to do with supernatural. What's the fun when you know even before the first minute that this is about ghosts? Not to mention that the word twist is a spoiler by itself! Once more, I urge everyone NOT to read reviews before going to see a movie and if they have to take advice only ask if it was either ""good"" or ""bad"". That's it. Nothing else."

Love for another person that go on living over Death (at the beginning Malcolm doesn't resign himself for being death)and the ability in feeling over our normal senses is the message i got.

","I have read a lot of good comments for this movie but I must admit that it was not my kind of 'horror' movie. Whilst other people seem to have gained a lot of insight into the underlying themes of this film, such as it's emotional intensity and unexpected twists, I was watching the film in the hope of being scared by it! As it turned out I was bitterly disappointed. I used to consider myself a complete woos where horror movies were concerned, but having made an effort to watch more of them recently I now find them throughly entertaining, although as yet non of them have really 'scared' me, as it were and 'Sixth Sense' was the worst of them all! That's not to say I didn't enjoy this movie to an extent. I enjoyed it for it's originality, handling of emotional issues and occasional shocks... the ending was totally unexpected. However when it came to the 'scare factor' this movie is totally lacking. My friends found it hilarious when I asked them what they thought about it one day and concluded in my opinion that this film should be a PG not a 15!!!! I understand that there are a couple of what could be described as mildly graphic moments in this movie... but seriously I have seen PG's more gory than this and U's that are a lot scarier... I mean what the heck is going on in 'Alice In Wonderland'? In conclusion this is not a movie I would recommend to any hard core 'horror' fan. If it didn't scare me when I first saw it then it wouldn't even scare a 3 month old (I used to be a total woos!!!!) I'm now looking forward to getting to grips with real horror movies such as 'The Shining', and won't be watching 'Sixth Sense' again anytime soon... I hope!!!!!"

","This is one of my favorite movies from the 1990s and all times. I had received very good reviews, so I went to watch it by myself (it's not the first time that a below average movie is unfairly overrated, and the opposite thing as well): I was far away from being disappointed. The beginning appears to show just another ordinary story, but that's just one of the cheating things from the movie (another one is the ending, but of course I can't reveal it). It's got all the ingredients for a perfect combination between drama, horror and thriller. I remember the fears of the boy (perfectly performed by Haley Joel Osment, who, by the way, was a few years older than his character Cole as well as the desperation of his mother, who can't understand what's happening to him (even when he tells her what happens), and just can't believe he contacts spirits (she things he's only victim of school abuse). I also remember the restless psychiatrist, trying to help the boy as well as he tries to save his marriage, but it's only at the end when he realizes what ACTUALLY happens. The great interaction between both characters, trying to help each other, is priceless. The dramatic story of Cole's grandma and his contacts with her spirit, which are only believed by his mother at the end, when he reveals a special thing. Well, just watch it."

This movie is more than a twist ending. It's how movies should be made.

His father's watch he found in the drawer. The fact he pays the kid to pretend to be his friend for his mothers benefit. The line 'They don't have meetings about rainbows.'

","The Sixth Sense is one of the absolute best movies I have seen in a LONG time.  Bruce Willis was fantastic--his character was very low key, which is kind of unusual for him.  And Haley Joel Osement is on his way to being an incredible actor.  The plot, the story of a little boy who sees dead people (that's not a spoiler if you ever even saw a preview for this movie!), is interesting, a little scary at times, just a touch gory at others, and very creepy a lot of the time. A sub plot, Malcolm's marital problems, ends up being very important to the overall story.<br/><br/>I don't think this really counts as a spoiler---at one point Cole tells Malcolm that ""you know how you feel the hairs on your neck stand up?

"eamon-hennedy","9","0","0","1 December 2003"," Creepy, but also deeply moving.
","It's not very often that a tale of the supernatural is also a deeply moving emotional experience. Usually if a tale of clairvoyance, or any narrative delving into the supernatural is going to be dealt with in a way that is emotionally very moving it is going to be done on a television series, like The X Files or Buffy. Here M Night Shyamalan creates a tale that deeply cinematic, at times unnerving and creepy, but which is deeply sad to the extent it will leave you with a tear in your eye. He succeeds admirably.<br/><br/>
Having Bruce Willis as a caring type in a film where he tries to protect a child has been done before in the shape of Mercury Rising. That film was not the biggest hit that Willis has had (even though it was quite an enjoyable film). Usually having Willis as a caring, fatherly type is akin to having Arnie or Sly in comedy movies. We just don't really want to see them in a film like that. Willis bucks the trend of doing something different by actually doing it well. Here is superb in a non action role, putting in his best performance since Pulp Fiction. A more restrained role without resorting to using guns or being chased or shouting dialog like 'yippe-ky-yay' is quite hard to believe, but here he pulls it of fantastically. In saying that he is supported by a fantastic supporting cast. Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are fantastic, but everyone is beaten to the acting stakes by Haley Joel Osmont. Never has a child actor put in a role of such maturity or brilliance. Even better, for a child actor, he doesn't try and milk the emotional parts by purposefully playing to the character. His performance is right on the tone of this downbeat and quiet little film. The scenes he shares with Willis are powerfully intense, but in that quiet little way. Likewise his scenes with Toni Collette, who nagged a best supporting actress nod and deservedly so. Anybody who doesn't have the hairs on the back of their neck standing up, but simultaneously moved to tears when Osmont's character Cole tells his mother played by Collete about her mother really should check their own pulse. This, along with the final scene of the film, demonstrate how emotional a horror film can be as when done correctly.<br/><br/>Having had the plot twist spoiled for me, I can't say if was a surprise or not, as not having watched the film and not know what was coming cannot lead me to saying. Knowing doesn't detract from this wonderful little film that was quite simply one of the best of 1999. The twist, which should be a horrifying moment, starts of initially as that, but develops into one of the saddest moments I have ever seen in a film. It demonstrates brilliantly what this film stands for. A creepy little thriller with the capacity to move you to tears."

","I've seen this movie several times and I still think it's quite brilliant. The funny thing whit this one is that when you see this movie for a second or third time you look at it in a different way. When I saw it for the first time in the cinema a few years ago I thought it was quite scary. Not because of big special effects,(because there are none) but because of the pressing atmosphere. I was also completely amazed by the ending of the movie. Something I really didn't see coming, but which rather made sense to me. It explained really everything what happened in the movie. So when I walked out of the cinema I had this instant feeling of wanting to see it again, which I did, on tape about a year later. Natural I now knew the ending, but I still enjoyed watching it, because of the great story. The third time around was a few weeks ago, when I saw it on TV, and I'm almost ashamed to admit that I really cried my eyes out this time. It then hit me that this movie isn't a thriller or Horror movie at all. It's really a very dramatic story about a little boy who learns to deal whit his problems and a psychiatrist who learns about the truth in his ""live"". And that they only could move on by helping each other. It's a really heartbreaking movie, not at least because of the great acting. I thought that Haley Joel Osment was really brilliant. He is so convincing. He really looked traumatised and scared all the time. I totally believed him. I'm not a big fan of Bruce Willis, but this time around I was quite suprised by his acting. He quite moved me. And also, last but not least, there goes a lot of credit to M. Night Shyamalan. The way he tells this story is perfect. It's slow for a Hollywood movie, but the story is so beautiful and smart, that I wasn't bored for a single moment."

","Sixth Sense, a movie that came out in 1999, is one of my favorites.  It is an edge of the seat thriller from start to finish.  This movie kept me guessing all the way through.  There are many twists and turns that finally lead the viewer up to twisted end. The movie starts out with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife (Olivia Williams) celebrating his award he won.  Dr. Crowe is a child psychologist.  When he walks into his bedroom, he witnesses a gruesome suicide of one of his ex-patients, which turns him to redeem himself by taking on a new client Cole (Haley Joel Osment). Cole has a problem that he will not tell anyone about.  Dr. Crowe spends the whole movie trying to get Cole to say what he has on his mind. At the beginning, Cole would not even let Dr. Crowe near him because he had a fear that Dr. Crowe was going to harm him.  But Dr. Crowe could not figure out why.  Progressively throughout the movie, Dr. Crowe kept inching closer to Cole. For some odd reason, Dr. Crowe and his wife was sliding apart.  He thought it was because he had been working on the Cole case.  But she would cry and not talk to him or even acknowledge he was even in her presence.  Before he could figure out Cole's problem, he just about went berserk when he saw his wife cheating on him.  Finally he got back to the Cole case.Cole's mother (Toni Collette) at the same time was trying to figure out what was going on with him.  Weird things were going on in the house, and she thought Cole was the source of it.  She would cry and beg him to tell him what was going on. She started noticing suspicious things around the house that was even scaring her more. Cole's mother was tired of him not telling her about his problems and his peers making fun of him.  For the most part, she gave up trying. Then it was in Dr. Crowe's hands to diagnose Cole's problems.<br/><br/>This movie unlike most kept its audience's attention to the end. The movie Sixth Sense ended just exciting as the middle of the movie, when most movies slope down toward the end.  The end of the movie brings everything together and makes sense to things that the audience wouldn't give much thought to."

","A very interesting movie with good acting. Reminded me at times of ""The Shining"".Although very slow at times, the theme is novel and demands the full attention of the viewer.The climax however is rather far-fetched and disappointing as it tends to add just that little too much imagination to the general fantasy.There is a tendency these days in movie making to often exaggerate in order to impress an audience but the achieved result is often exactly the opposite of what the producer or director intended.Viewers in general have become so accustomed to excess that they welcome an uncomplicated approach to a theme.It is therefore regretful that ""The Sixth Sense"" lost some of its appeal by falling into the above-mentioned trap."

","M. Night Shyamaina's ""The Sixth Sense"" has come a long way since movies about psychological issues hit the big screen back in 1945 with Alfred Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" and shows how much we learned about the subject since then. <br/><br/>Dr. Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis, is on top of the world a success in his chosen profession, child psychology, and married to a beautiful and caring wife Anna, Olivia Williams. At the beginning of the film Dr. and Mrs. Crowe down in the living room drinking themselves almost drunk with wine. Celebrating Dr. Crowe being awarded the Mayor's Citation for Professional Excellence Award from the city of Philadelphia. Going up the stairs to the bedroom Dr. Crowe sees that the window is broken and there's someone in the house. When he looks towards the bathroom Dr. Crowe sees that the light is turned on and there's someone in there. <br/><br/>Dr. Crowe trying to get the intruder who's very emotionally disturbed at ease by talking to him finds out that he was one of his patients that he treated who went wrong Vincent Gray, Donnie Wahlberg. Before Dr. Crowe can go any further Vincent pulls out a gun and shoots him point blank and then turns the gun on himself.<br/><br/>The movie then jumps some six months later when Dr. Crowe recovered and back on the job is assigned to his first patient since being shot. He's to treat a six year-old boy Cole Sear, Haley Joel Osment, who's having problems at school and at home. Cole can't get along not only with his classmates and his teachers but also with his single parent mother Lynn Sear, Toni Collette. Cole withdrawn and quite and he gets scared and frightened for apparently no reason when he's looking at seemingly harmless people and places or at nothing at all. <br/><br/>Dr. Crowe starts to talk to Cole as he tries to analyze him and to the Dr.'s surprise little Cole seems to come out of his shell. Cole not only responds to him in an unafraid manner to which he doesn't do to any of his classmates and teachers, whom he knows a lot more the Dr. Crowe, he also also confides in him to what his fears are. <br/><br/>Young Cole has hallucinations that, as he tells a very interested and concerned Dr. Crowe, he ""sees dead people"". He sees them everywhere, in school, in the streets even at home. He sees them everywhere he looks and there are some that don't even know that there dead. Dr. Crowe at first feels that he's getting through to young Cole and puts all of his attention and efforts to curing him of his psychosis. What he doesn't realize is that the attention that he's paying to Cole is jeopardizing his whole life by neglecting his wife and his friends. As well any other cases of child psychological disorders that he may have to examine and cure in the future.<br/><br/>You begin to wonder why Dr. Crowe is paying so much attention to Cole? Is it that Cole reminds him of Vincent Gray whom he failed so many years ago which ended with him being shot and Vincent killing himself. Is Dr. Crowe afraid that young Cole if not cured will end up the same way? Did that terrible incident at the beginning of the movie damage Dr. Crowe so severely that it completely wrecked his ability as a child psychologist to do his work and made him need psychological help himself? <br/><br/>What really surprised me about ""The Sixth Sense"" was the quality of Bruce Willis acting in the movie even more then the already legendary, although it's been only four years since the film was released back in 1999, surprise ending. Bruce Willis carried the movie with an academy award caliber performance without a shoot-out explosion or car chase or almost any action at all which Bruce Willis movies are noted for. Willis played the exact opposite a role that he would usually play and excelled in it.<br/><br/>You also have to give top acting credit to the young Haley Joel Osment who played the young boy Cole Sear who held his own and sometime even eclipsed Willis in every scene that they were in together. If ""The Sixth Sense"" showed anything besides being a top psychological thriller is that when Bruce Willis is too old and unconvincing to play action hero parts he'll still have a very bright future in films that would only require acting."

They were both really interesting to watch and each scene was done soo well.

I bought the movie as soon as it came out, and it's really one of the great movies people should own. There's nothing like this horror/thriller, a one of kind, wonderfully acted, directed, and written movie. It'll be a classic someday, and it is currently #78 of the top 250 movies at imdb.com.

The ""twist"" to the movie was surely just that-didn't even see it coming. What is really cool about Sixth Sense and one of the things that makes it an excellent movie, is that it can still be watched after you've seen it once-even knowing what the ""twist"" is.<br/><br/>This was one of my favorite movies to come out around this time period, it is absolutely unique.

I love this movie yet you can't watch it to much but I'd recommend it to anyone to watch if they haven't seen it already.  ***Spoiler***  I also liked how M.

","PLOT SPOILER<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan makes a brilliant directorial debut in this chiller-drama focusing on the Sixth Sense of the title. Not only does it bring about the required scares, but also it equally backs this up with some brilliant acting from all concerned. <br/><br/>The film has that haunting, suspenseful atmosphere, as you really don't know what will happen next. But the one problem that has occurred in Shyamalan's film so far is the limited re-watchable factor. While at first it appears to be unpredictable and suspenseful, second time round you will notice the long gap between scares and the film loses it's intended atmosphere.<br/><br/>
But the quality of the acting will never wear thin. Bruce Willis defies his critics and proves that he can act, giving a humane performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Though lacking in experience, Haley Joel Osment is brilliant as the disturbed, depressed kid, and deserved the Oscar which he didn't win. Olivia Williams and Toni Colette make good support in their respective roles. <br/><br/>`The Sixth Sense' is most famous for its HUGE twist in the end. In some ways it was good and a smart way to conclude the film, but then again it doesn't make logical sense and is unintentionally funny. I mean, Bruce Willis' character was dead for nearly a year and he hadn't noticed. What a dunce!<br/><br/>
But in retrospect, `The Sixth Sense' is a haunting, subtle and brilliant piece of work that will live long in the memory. 7.9/10."

","shyamalan has crafted a beautiful film here, that's more chilling than scary. You all know the story by know, and yes, there are then thousand plot holes, but it really doesn't matter when you have film-making of this standard. The direction and score go hand in hand perfectly. While the actors all give their best, most notably toni collette and haley joel osment. Osment is the films heart, with a performance easily up there as one of cinema's best. The scariest thing in the film is how the kid manages to convey his emotions so realistically. When he is scared in the movie, he genuinely looks scared, and that is no easy feat to do with a big camera pointing in your face. Bruce Willis does a good job, proving that he can actually act very well when he wants to. But he is outshone by osment, which is probably best for the movie anyway. The plot is strong, and unwinds at it's own crawling pace, but it pay's off in the end with a touching finale that makes you want to watch the whole film again. And not many films do that."

","I nearly did not watch this one as I see no future in Bruce Willis categorized as one of those he-men in so-called action films: Seagal, Schwarzenegger, van Damme, Lundgren, Willis and the ilk are patently for underdeveloped fourteen-year-olds. Fortunately several things caught my eye on IMDb and <br/><br/>It has been years since I last saw a film which might vaguely be categorized horror thriller which so held my attention, indeed so many years that I cannot even recall its title. Evidently Bruce Willis did not do this film for the pay-cheque, as he put all his heart and soul into it, such that he was not just simply bearable but very acceptable indeed. I hope he will do a few more like this film and leave the bravura stuff to the chimpanzees cavorting about the place with nothing to show or tell apart from biceps and fly-sized brains. Good work here, which obviously made or broke the film.<br/><br/>But it is Haley Joel Osment who towers over him: an extraordinary performance from this eleven-year-old (when making the film). He has certainly come a long way since his minor rôle in `Forrest Gump', and judging by his performance in `The Sixth Sense' he has a long way yet still to go.  I would have like to see more of Mischa Barton in this film, but the story would not have handled two big parts from tender-aged actors. After her astounding rôle in `Lawn Dogs' (1997) (qv) together with an incredible Sam Rockwell, I had expected - hoped for - something greater than her brief appearances here. However, this is only a small gripe, taking what the picture is worth as a whole.<br/><br/>During this film I uttered to my wife: but this is Oscar stuff. So I hopped up to see IMDb, and discovered that indeed the young Osment got a nomination for his rôle in this film. I am not at all surprised. Full marks, then, to Mr. Manoj Night Shyamalan for so wonderfully piecing together the parts and getting some really absorbing scenes during his story. One scene has the young boy lying in bed and Bruce Willis at his side: I assure you sparks, flew between the two actors  not just simply `good chemistry'.<br/><br/>Of films of this genre it is definitely one of the very very few I would like to see again."

","Before I had seen ""The Sixth Sense"" all I heard was that it was about it was a kid who saw dead people. It is much more than that. It is a movie about a kid who sees dead people, but it is also a film that shows us how lonely children can be and how a divorce can effect a child's life. Haley Joel Osment plays Coal, a recent victim to his parents divorce. Coal is a very lonely child, as we see throughout the movie he has no friends and he always gets picked on. His mother (Toni Collette) is always trying to comfort him, and talk to him, but Coal does not want to be comforted.<br/><br/>
The movie starts out with Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) a child phychologist, who has recently won an award for his work in child phychology. He and his wife go up to their room after admiring the award only to find that their house has been broken in to. The person who has broken in is a depressed and miserable man who is a former patient of Crowe's. He states that he was a child of a divorced couple and that when he was a child, Malcolm was sent to help him. He is very upset with Malcolm because Malcolm did not help him at all. When Malcolm offers to help him, the patient (Donnie Wahlberg) picks up a gun on the toilet and shoots Malcolm. We then see the patient commit suicide and Malcolm's wife going over to the bed to help Malcolm.<br/><br/>
The scene then switches over to Coal again. He is going to be the next patient of Malcolm. Coal and Malcolm get off to a very bad start. Coal clearly does not like Malcolm and does not want him to help him. Eventually Coal and Malcolm get to be friends and Coal says that he has a secret that he has not told anybody. He says he will tell Malcolm. His secret is: I see dead people. This unleashes a whole different problem for Malcolm. Before he was trying to help Coal with his parents divorce. Now he must find a way to make the dead people go away.<br/><br/>This is a pure horror film. If you get scared very easily, this is not the right movie for you. It has occured to me that M. Night Shamayalan is the next Steven Spielberg. Along with this movie, Mr. Shamayalan also  made Signs (which is as good as this film), another horror flick that shows a stunning reality of what Earth could be like if it was being invaded by aliens. Shamayalan does an excellent job of directing ""Signs"". Shamayalan also does an excellent job with this film. His casting is right on target. Haley Joel Osment does a sensational job as Coal, and Bruce Willis, once again, gives a great performance as Malcolm Crowe. Shamaylan definetely knows how to scare and when to scare correctly, and he also knows how to direct correctly. The truth of ""The Sixth Sense"" will blow your mind.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","This movie was never scary to me. It was always just sad. Don't get me wrong, I really loved this movie. I was just able to allow myself to see deeper than a few scares. Like all good ghost stories, once you peel away the fear of the unknown, there is a story of sadness. Of life cut short. In most good ghost stories, the ghost's need our help and reach out to us. The fear comes from our reaction to them. They are the dead who have no voice and are trapped. This movie is a beautiful portrait of sadness. It also had a wonderful relationship between a mother and her son. She cannot reach him, she is the only person that thinks he's normal, he will never let her know how different he is. They, just like the ghosts, have no way to communicate with one another. There is love and small moments of joy that they share but always under a blanket of sadness. I love this movie because it tells us a story. A good story about a scary subject but puts a new twist on it. It reminds us how sad and lonely ghosts can be, and how much they need us, and how we need them. It shows us that sadness does not end with death, we can carry with us always. Sometimes we just need someone to set us free."

I must say that initially I was not interested. I was not in the mood for the 'classic' and dragging story.

Bruce Willis, as expected, gave a very convincing portrayal of the helpful psychologist. But I was short of appalled when he was nominated for Best Actor, and Osment for Best Supporting Actor. I protest. Haley Joel Osment played the centre character here, and Willis, legend as he is, played the supporting role. I was mesmerized by Haley Joel Osment. That kid took on the part that demanded maturity to an extreme level, and he delivered his part flawlessly. Flawlessly!<br/><br/>It's really hard to see good child actors these days. Hey... it's really hard to see good child actors these period. And Haley proved prodigious. His performance cannot be equalled in the near future... not easily.<br/><br/>Anyway, when the movie finished, my cousin, thoroughly impressed, said,""You weren't expecting that, were you?"" I nodded no. We talked about the movie for a while, and he left. Immediately, I saw the movie again. I have great respect for Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, and for Bruce Willis.

However, they hear rustling, and a former patient, Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg), comes in and accuses him of not curing himself. Vincent then shoots Malcolm and himself.<br/><br/>Six or eight months later, Malcolm finds a new patient, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). He has problems at home, and so does Malcolm. It seems that Malcolm has put so much time into his work he can't spend any more time with Anna. However, as Malcolm's sessions with Cole become more productive and we find out why Cole is so upset-`I see dead people.' So Malcolm has to figure out why they attack Cole while sorting out problems at home with Anna.<br/><br/>There is not one thing I would change about this movie. The acting is top-notch, the chills are supreme and genuine, and I found myself loving this movie.<br/><br/>Osment was, for lack of a better word, screwed at the Oscars. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than Michael Caine (though he also was excellent in The Cider House Rules). Osment displayed solid emotions and really did everything his role required him to do. If Tatum O'Neal can win an Oscar at a young age, so could Osment. Willis didn't say one `yippie-kay-yay' and portrayed his role earnestly and with lots of heart. Williams and Toni Collette (who plays Cole's mother) also did outstanding jobs, but perhaps the most standout performance (next to Osment) was Wahlberg. His part was tiny, but important, and he worked hard for it, losing thirty pounds and displaying true fear, just like Osment.<br/><br/>Rather than going for the ultra-gore, Shyamalan went for perfect creeps. With chilling music that gets you at the bone, he uniquely displayed torments to the characters and to us. Although I have seen the movies many times, I was still spooked. I feel glad that he didn't have to go to the lowest common denominator and show blood and brain matter everywhere (during a suicide, he was nice enough to keep it off screen). This is a movie that, if you rent on a Saturday night, you'll be up till dawn.<br/><br/>Shyamalan (who also wrote) decided to put in strong dramatic elements. Willis slowly losing his wife was played with great tenderness and not mockery or cruelness. Its ginger display of human life taking a turn for the worse really stood out. That is good movie making when you can combine three things to make a standout movie: acting, thrills, and drama.<br/><br/>I actually wanted The Sixth Sense to go on for a lot longer. I wanted to see more of the plight of Malcolm and Cole; I was transfixed. And the ending twist still was somewhat of a shock, even though I know what it was. I couldn't see it even if it stared me in the face, which it did. Shyamalan put in symbolism, which becomes obvious once you see it the second time. Evidence for the twist is so obvious when you are watching it for a repeated time, you'll wonder how you missed it. As I said before: that's great moviemaking.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material and violent images."

","The Sixth Sense can achieve the title of best horror movie of the 90's with little trouble. Is has an amazing script, a brilliant director, and top-class performances. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job and presents himself as a firm promise for the future of acting. This movie will keep you interested to the end and awards should be given to those who anticipated the fabulous plot twist that the final ten minutes of this movie present us. Although this movie was released on what was probably the worst decade for horror movies ever, it will surely take his part in history as one of the best the world will lay their eyes on for many years. This is movie presents enormous maturity and interest and even those who are not fans of the genre will surely appreciate The Sixth Sense.

","WARNING SPOILERS ahead: THE hyped up twist spoilt this movie for me.From the openig credits i was looking for the twist. The year after bruce was shot i had big suspicions, as the film went on my suspicions were proved  more and more.Knowing this was a supernatural thriller did not help either. the giveaways were that bruce never spoke to anyone else than Haley Joel Osmond. there was never any interaction between Haley Joels mother and Bruce, his wife never spoke to him, the restaurant scene especially reminded me of ghost, and when Haley tells Bruce he sees dead people that was the final straw. Now if i had known nothing about this film i would have most probably been blown away, this is one of the dangers of being hyped. It was still a good movie though the acting was great, and there was ageneral creepiness to it, and even though i guessed the twist it was still a good idea. i did have problems with it though why  did Bruce never wonder why everyone else apart from Haley Joel ignored him,How did Bruce come in contact with him, no one hires dead councellors, why was the girl being poisoned and what was the significance of the red door knob etc.All in all a good movie but the less you know about it the better."
"TVOR","8","0","0","22 November 2002"," Somewhat predictable but emotional strong tension
","I didn't see the trailer and I didn't knew anything about this movie excluding that many have said it's very good. Afterwards I saw the trailer and thought; that's like taking part of the effect out of the movie. Name Sixth Sense was only clue and from the first scene I knew this is going to build up into very pensive and prosperous atmosphere. Movie works extremely well almost throughoutly, but tension suffers in last part. It's not the ending itself, but certain aspects of melodramacy and the story itself is a bit repetitive towards ending. Anyhow that's only criticism afterwards.<br/><br/>When watching the movie it takes psychological control over your mind if you just let it to do so. Then it goes on all the way to the end and you should find yourself staring vacantly ending credits with strong emotions on surface. Sixth Sense had the same effect than Jacob's Ladder. Nowhere near same movies, but psychological emotional effect is same. Second time watching this film will be different experience.<br/><br/>Story itself is being weaved together almost seamlessly. Shyamalan has certainly put a lot of thinking how to build up the story properly without taking compromises. Simplicity works like a beauty and film maintains calm, even peaceful atmosphere all the way despite of fearful moments twisting your mind and sending cold chills down to your spine.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment as a little boy Cole does just astonishing job. Not just as a child-actor but as an actor. Toni Collette as his mother does a good job too regardless of few mediocre scenes. Bruce Willis is just a slightly bit too self-sufficient in his acting, but does maybe one of the best roles of his career (12 Monkeys was pretty good too). It's more to do with his general acting-personality-image from other films than acting itself in this film.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch Sixth Sense, watch it with open mind, otherwise you'll spoil the experience."

","First I would like to say that this is a great film. Secondly, I Would like to say to everyone out there who says that The Others is a Copy of this film has no concept of reality. The Others was written before this film was, so that argument can be put to rest right here. I really think this film is great, and if it didn't have the major plot holes that it does I would have given it a much higher score then I did (6/10). I have always been a fan of Bruce Willis, regardless of what is said about him I feel he is one of the better actors of the past 2 decades or so. I feel, however, that Haley Joe Osment puts in the best performance here. I don't see his career amounting to much of anything, but I think this single performance will wind up haunting him for the rest of his life because honestly, he will never grow out of it in the eyes of the audience. I feel Haley makes this film creepy, and keeps the suspense stirring throughout. I can see why Toni Collette got no nods for her performance here. Besides the scene towards the end in the car with Haley, I feel she does a below par job in this film. ***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Ok this is where I feel the film lost a lot of luster. There were some pretty big plot holes. Everyone who hasn't seen it yet don't read on until the end of spoilers. How can malcolm not realize he is dead until the end of the film? Where does he sleep at night? I mean doesn't he realize that his wife isn't talking to, or even looking at him at all? I know they say in the film that the dead only see what they want to, but how does he explain this to himself? The other thing that really turned me off at the end was when cole had told Malcolm earlier in the film that the room becomes very cold when an ill-tempered or mean spirit enters the room. Well then why was malcolms wife freezing in the last scene when he was the only spirit in the room? He certainly didn't seem that angry to me. ***END OF SPOILERS*** Those spoilers are the reason the film goes from an 8 or 9, to a 6. There are some great scenes in this movie, and the concept is exceptional, I just wish they had tied up those loose ends. I also question the message of this film. It definitely comes off as a suspense/love story. I think anyone who likes this film will love The Others. Some people will disagree, but only because their attention span is limited. The plot to that film has zero holes in it, and is just as creepy and suspensful as this film. Overall this film is still definitely worth your time, and should be checked out!"
"ennals","Null","0","0","13 October 2002"," A theory (warning - contains spoiler)
","I missed this when it came out, but enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs in the theatres. Having just seen it on tv, I found I enjoyed it despite knowing about the twist ending - in fact I enjoyed seeing how the trick was worked.<br/><br/>
SPOILER ALERT I've noticed several people in these comments making the very good point, ""how could Dr. Crowe go a whole year not noticing that no one was talking to him, etc?"" In fact one might wonder how the other ghosts, some of whom had clearly been dead for centuries, had failed to notice their condition - the gunshot boy looks to be from the '70s and his casual manner suggests he doesn't know anything's wrong, while the servant in the attic has been yelling for help for lord knows how long, as if he were still alive. This behaviour (pretty typical for both fictional ghosts and those described in actual (?) hauntings) suggests that ghost perceptions are not quite those of the living. Crowe tells his wife in the restaurant scene that he's been having trouble keeping track of time. We only see him when he's working on Cole's case or attempting to interact with his wife - that is, when he's doing the things he's been left on earth to complete. May I suggest that the rest of the time he does not exist, or is in some form of limbo he can only remember confusedly afterwards? After all, time doesn't need to pass the same way for a ghost as for a living human. Anyway, given the intelligence of the script, I thought I'd give Shamalan the benefit of the doubt and try to think up a possible explanation. Possibly on the DVD he talks about this."

","M. Night Shyamalan has created a unique and interesting atmosphere throughout The Sixth Sense. This is a film (not unlike ""The Usual Suspects"")which is often spoken about and critiqued for it's ending, and much is forgotten about it's content. There are genuine spooks and an unsettling feeling that the viewer's feel throughout ""The Sixth Sense"" and is present on each viewing.<br/><br/>I comment on the film after having seen Shyamalan's two subsequent works ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"". In each Shyamalan attempt's to deliver the message of faith, religion and fate. It is to the credit of ""The Sixth Sense"" that these messages are more cleverly woven into the plot of the film, without being blatant as we have seen since. Shymalan presents this in a down to earth, low key fashion. It is without a doubt the crown jewel of his work's.<br/><br/>All acting performances are exceptional. Some stereotyping goes into each character. Colette the typical single mum and Willis the child psychologist out for redemption. However this works well around the deep and complex central character and theme.<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" can stand it's head above most other film's of it's time. I rate it very highly.

Emotionally and physically numbed, the psychologist takes on a new patient: a child who believes he can communicate with the dead.  In addition to feelings of depression and self-doubt, the psychologist is having difficulty in communicating with his wife, who has become increasingly distant since the shooting.  Gradually the relationship he establishes with his patient draws him into a strange reality.<br/><br/>	""Sixth Sense"" is a character study with profound concerns, on the theme of self-absorption and despair in a spiritual universe.  Somber and low-key, it is misrepresented as a suspense thriller.  Viewers should be prepared for a counterpoint to the works of Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman: the fundamental conflict in the film is between alienation and awareness leading to salvation.  Anyone expecting the more familiar Hollywood treatment of ghosts and the afterlife will be disappointed: there is no series of jack-in-the-box surprises as found in ""The Shining"" or Nicole Kidman's ""The Others"".  The concerns of ""Sixth Sense"" are similar to, but significantly different from, those of Robin Williams' film ""What Dreams May Come"", without the dramatic imagery.   While the mood and pacing of ""Sixth Sense"" are deliberately oppressive, the final revelation illuminates not merely the series of clues scattered throughout the film but the predicament of the protagonist... and by implication that of the audience.<br/><br/>	This is a well-crafted and thought-provoking film, and the acting, while restrained, is also excellent.  Ironically, many viewers have found the surprise ending to be a distraction: some people seem to have sat through the film waiting for ""the twist"".  Paying attention to the characters and the message that is developed in the story will be more rewarding.  However if you dislike Bergman-esque films this one is not for you either."

Every second of the film has a point and keeps it's pace, a rarity in modern movie making. The masterpiece of film which is incredibly moving and monumental, and above all things, GOOD, is ultimate film perfection. M. Night Shyamalan is a story telling genius and this movie is NOT for die hard, spiritual side-less, skeptics of anything remotley beyond only what the eye can see. The story is one of the best and to top perfect direction and storytelling, every single actor can hold a scene incredibly. <br/><br/> Bruce Willis, who is a very good actor, when the scripts give him a chance (Story of Us) is the best he's ever been in here. And Haley Joel Osment is a very good actor, and not just a kid actor at that. I can't think of another one like him, who is an adult actor in a kid's body. Everyone in this movie holds up their scenes with brilliance, giving the audience a movie that I remember hooking me from the first scene. Each time I see this movie I see something new, from the 3 times I saw it at the show and the countless others I've seen it at home, larger than life goosebumps never fail to overcome me in the film's finally moments (tears come also, and throughout the very moving film. The film is just perfect, through and through, with an original (to whoever compared it to Ghost...? Ghost was incredibly corny). The scene with Haley Joel and Toni Colette in the car at the end, is one of the most moving ever to be filmed. There are simply not enough words of praise for this film, it's my favorite ever (sharing the spot with a select few). I love it, I love it, I love it. Oh, and the film is brilliantly scored also. Also, The Sixth Sense is not only about the twist ending, the film before that is more than enough to hold an entire one on, but the ending boosts the film up to perfection. I simply love this movie. It's the greatest. Infinite stars out of ten."

"magic_marker","9","0","0","23 August 2002"," Captured the essence of the ""altered place""
","There are certain places in this world (you know the ones I mean, for you have all seen them), that though they might appear perfectly normal in every way, are somehow... different. They may be a street near your house, or a disused park behind your office. They may only take on this difference at a certain time of day, or perhaps only you see it. But that difference, that altered state, manifests itself in, to use Cole's phrase, the prickly things on the back of your neck. These are the kinds of places in which you feel compelled to whisper, even when outdoors, and that make you feel you are not alone, even when you are. Somewhere, inside these places, you feel, other worlds must exist.<br/><br/>For me, the greatest achievement of ""The Sixth Sense"" was not its well-constructed plot or its twist ending; both of these lose their punch on repeat viewings, but rather its masterful evocation of that sense of otherness, as if it had managed to turn the entire city of Philadelphia into an ""altered place."" In the main the man responsible for this is Tak Fujimoto, Shyamalan's cinamatographer, who shot ""The Silence of the Lambs."" His shots are both hyperrealistic and dark, mixing shade with sudden bursts of colour, creating a feeling of a world decidedly different from our own. Credit must also go to James Newton Howard, whose elegant, beautiful and creepy score was kept almost subliminal, leaving over its notes a wall of silence that ways down on the heart. <br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" is of course, Shyamalan's film, but it was those two who made it immortal."

","Bruce Willis gives his most subdued and by far greatest performance in this haunting tale of the supernatural that will stick with you far after the credits role. Willis manages to impress me more each time he is in a movie (with the exception of Bandits). The story starts off with Malcome Crowe (Willis) a great childrens shrink who after getting an award comes home to find someone who he failed to help in his bathroom. We now fast forward to the present where Crowe is having marriage problems and is helping a young child (Haley Joel Osment in his Oscar nominated perfromance) who ""sees dead people."" Although it is a ghost story it is far from horror, but really a brillient drama that is more about love and friendship more than thinks that go bump in the night. The climax is one of the best I've seen and a brilliant script from writer/director M. Night Shamalyn will keep you guessing right up until the intese ending. I believe Bruce Willis was comptly ripped off for not at least recieveing an Oscar nod for his near perfect performance, who in my opinion was far superior to Kevin Spacey in American Beauty."
"dreamerboi23","Null","0","0","27 July 2002"," interesting patter for films
","I have seen this film 3 times already and have always considered it a thriller and nothing more.  As an expecation for an excellent thriller in mind i saw unbreakable and thought it was pretty good however not as powerful as the sixth sense.  With the same expectation i saw a screening for the upcoming movie Signs.  After watching it i felt let down that M Night's film seem to move further from my expectations as some critics say a ""mind blowing"" thriller.  I have come to realize from viewing these movies that M. Nights film have a deeper meaning that like very few films has a moral.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE, or SIGNS*<br/><br/>We all consider Sixth Sense a excellent thriller, but after thinking about it for some time; one moral/idea that this film has demonstrated was that life is too important to be indulged in trivial things.  Clearly shown by Bruce Willis character, that sees his work as priority.  Money can always be lost and made, life isnt as flexible.  Unbreakable also has these moralistic ideas.  For example when it is revealed that David Dunn faked his car injury.  Love at times requires sacrifices.  Popularity (football) will last a short time and people get hurt and realize that their lives change after one incident, love lasts forever.  Signs no doubt has a spiritual presence in hope and faith.<br/><br/>After considering all these films, I have come to respect M Night Shyamalan more has a writer, direct, and actor that extends past this orginal preconception of an excellent story-teller for thrillers.  Although I love watching the great moments of thrills and suspense shown in few films such as the Sixth Sense.  I have learned to expect more from Shyamalans films intellectually rather than a surprising ""jump"" from various scenes in his movies. I have talked to many people who have felt that Sixth Sense was te last best thriller Night will ever make.  In some aspects they might be right but if the audience begins to see Shyamalans films for more reasons other than the great thrills, they will look past this notion that Shyamalan is only known for his suspense and thrills.  Shyamalan makes excellent use of suspense and thrills to bring the audience into his films, but i do not see that as his only talent as a director, writer, and actor.  His films make you as a viewer think about different things rather than giving 90-120 mins of eye candy to awe at.  This i think are his greatest talents, I hope to see Shyamalan become a great writer and director.  And that people will not live in the memory of how great the sixth Sense was as a Thriller, but as a film that entices a person to consider different things."

","Do you believe in the paranormal, or there is more to this world than the living?  Do you believe children are contacted by spirits more often than adults?  When you think about scary movies, there is always a child involved.  Either the child dies early in the movie, or the child is who the spirit/demon contacts.  This is because our emotions will be triggered by this child.  The child is an agent used to gain and keep the viewer's interest. In The Sixth Sense, the child is Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment).  Bruce Willis plays the distinguished child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who had a patient he couldn't cure.  Cole is like the other child, and Dr. Crowe is determined to help him.  Cole shares his secret:  `I see dead people.' The dead people come to visit periodically. Cole's role with the deceased is to act as an agent to help them find peace, and we find that Dr. Crowe is a spirit needing help.  The movie is surprising.  The unexpected ending of Dr. Crowe being deceased is well planned, and after the movie the director M. Night Shyamalan reveals his secret.  Every time a ghost is present, an item on the screen is red. This is a very suspenseful movie, and left me very surprised.  If Mr. Shyamalan's intentions were to write a suspenseful thriller, I believe he hit the mark."

","The Sixth Sense chilled me to the bone, with it's excellent performances, brilliant storytelling and wonderful directing by M. Night Shyamalan (who also wrote the screenplay). Malcom Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist, and Cole (Osment) is Malcom's latest patient. I won't reveal anymore of the plot, as I feel less known about it the better. The film has a tremendous amount of atmosphere that oozes out of the screen, engulfing your every sense. There were at least two scenes that made me jump! And the film also has some rather funny moments, namely the video camera scene. If you never thought Bruce Willis was a very good actor, your mind will definitely be changed after seeing his excellent portrayal of Crowe. Australian born Toni Collette shines as Cole's Mother. And Haley Joel Osment brings shame to almost every other child actor in a film. He truly is a gifted actor, and I look forward to watching his career blossom. Much has been said of the films ending, and I don't dare say anything about it. Only that it is truly amazing. In the future I feel this film will be looked on as a landmark in cinematic brilliance in every aspect. 9/10"

","Never before have I ever seen such an awesome suspense thriller.  This one had it all:  intrigue, of course suspence, eerie atmosphere, great involved acting, and the most unique and creative angle on scary films.  Before this film I thought that it wasn't possible to have a horror flick with a plot. Now I can actually look forward to scary films with the hopes that they will have as great -or near- a story line as this one.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis captures eerie from his facial expressions to the tone of his voice.  I've always liked his movies and this one is no exception.  In fact, he's given much more dramatic room in this one.  He shows that he doesn't need fast paced action or cop roles all the time.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment is the best.  I've seen several other of is movies at the time of this writing and he never ceases to amaze me.  At first, I felt sympathy for this child, then as it progressed I realized that his was the coolest role of all (you'll see).  He's been gifted with a wide range of emotional display.  When he smiles, it warms your heart.  His tears choke you up.  And his 'intelligence' is intriguing.<br/><br/>Each of the other actors deserve mention here, as well.  I just don't want to ramble on and on.  The mother was very 'real'.  The antagonistic child friends of 'Cole Sear' (Osment's character) capture the essence and cruelty of some kids.<br/><br/>This movie started by making me interested, then pulled by right in, and finally made me feel like I was a part of it.  I watch it again and again and it never disappoints me or makes me tired of it.  If you haven't seen this film, you MUST!!<br/><br/>I give it 10/10 for literally EVERYTHING in it.  thank you."

","""The Sixth Sense"", released in 1999, and starring Bruce Willis, gives a new version of the age old mystery regarding life after death.  Does the dead person immediately leave this world, or is there a time when the spirit has a chance to stay around awhile?  This film will cause the viewer to ponder that mystery while watching the cast wrestle with that concern, and watching dead people appear, then leave the screen.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist that takes on a case that involves a child, Haley Joel Osmond, who has a problem relating to peers and his single parent.  Willis has recently been involved in a situation that left him wounded, and this is one of his first cases since a shooting that occurred at his home.  Willis is able to establish a working child-doctor relationship with Cole, the Osmond character, but at the same time finds his own relationship with his wife chilling, even to the point of not existing. During the film, there are several scenes that involve Dr. Crowe, (Willis) with his wife, and she totally ignores him, as if he weren't even there.<br/><br/>The film does hold the viewing public in a suspense-filled grip, with the ending being somewhat expected, but nevertheless, causing the watcher to want to see the film again to see what they missed.  A good film to have on VHS or DVD, as there are some excellent commentaries on both formats in regards to the clues that were given during the film.  This film was nominated for several academy awards, and while not an oscar winner,it was very much on the minds of the movie public during the end of the 20th century.  A good, intense mystery."

","Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. He takes on a young patient named Cole Sear (another name you'd only hear in the movies, played by Haley Joel Osment). Cole has some fear that he can't communicate to the world, but it's something that hurts him both physically and mentally and it's up to Dr. Crowe to help him. Crowe needs to redeem himself because a former patient of his didn't get the help he needed, and one night broke into Crowe's apartment, and shot Crowe before turning the gun on himself. So in Crowe's mind, helping Cole is as much about helping himself, as it is helping the child. When Crowe uncovers the mystery of Cole's fear, it makes him come to a terrifying realization about himself that changes his life forever. <br/><br/>So like I said before, for the most part, this movie was very slow moving and never seemed to get to the point. Osment's acting was spectacular for someone so young. He truly seemed afraid at every turn and you felt really sorry for him. Willis seemed to be going through the motions in this one, but I think he understood that the movie was about the kid and not about him, so he needed to be a little more reserved that normal. It's not giving away too much to say that this movie has the mother of all plot twists and when that happened, it really made the movie special. Not many times do you leave a theater actually talking about what just happened and trying to figure it all out. That's what made the movie so entertaining, and why it's been making all this money. People leave the theater not thinking about the boring part, but thinking about the ending. The screenplay itself was just ok. Some of the dialogue seemed extremely cheesy and unnecessary. And there was way too much whispering. A few people I've talked to even said the movie was confusing until the very end. For a truly great movie I think it needed to be entertaining right up until the big twist, and then have the twist take it up to a whole other level, rather than being a so-so movie that becomes good at the end.  See below.<br/><br/>I would definitely watch The Sixth Sense over, and over, and over again.<br/><br/>
SPOILER<br/><br/>The big twist of course at the end is that Dr. Crowe realizes that he is one of the dead people that Cole can see and talk to. When that hit, it absolutely stunned me. I was not ready for that to be the big plot twist I had heard about. Immediately I think everyone in the theater started to replay the entire movie to make sure it was all possible. And for the most part the screenplay was solid enough that it was possible, especially with the seemingly thrown away line of, ""dead people only see what they want to see"". It's a line that by itself didn't mean anything, but once Crowe realized he was dead, it all came rushing back. <br/><br/>But here's my question. Did Crowe not interact with a single person in this movie? When he was at the hospital, did he not talk to one of the doctors? Did he never try and talk to Cole's mother? Wouldn't he have thought at least that people were ignoring him? There's a scene that starts off by showing Dr. Crowe and Cole's mother sitting in chairs facing each other in her living room.  In walks Cole, and Dr. Crowe starts talking to him.  What was going on prior to the scene beginning?  How did Dr, Crowe get into the home?  I know in the movie Cole said that dead people don't think they're dead, but you would think that when one of them tried to talk to a living person they'd realize something was up. Somehow I don't buy the dead people only see what they want to see line covering up the fact that Crowe didn't talk to a single person throughout the film. But otherwise the ending was a very good surprise and completely changed my opinion of the film. So go see it."

Night Shamaylan (sp - who cares?) would have thought of the idea to make this movie? Now, I'll give credit, although the plot is extremely imitative, the performances were first rate. There was little music. The pace was slow, that added a lot of apprehension.   It was easy to be drawn into the movie. It was entertaining. But that's it. Nothing special, nothing new.

","The Sixth Sense had quite a lot of hype before it was released in 1999. The hype was very well deserved.<br/><br/>When I watched this film in early 2000, it was the first film in a while that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. When young Cole Sear (excellently payed by Haley Joel Osmont)starts seeing the spirits of dead people it really gets at your nerves and as the mystery unravels throughout the film it get's more and more eerie.<br/><br/>Those who haven't seen the film have probably heard that it has a twist ending but I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say that the mystery isn't that hard to figure out if you watch carefully but it still scares you at the end.<br/><br/>This was,in my opinion, Bruce Willis's best role in years and he really did a good job. The Sixth Sense is brilliant and far better than that overrated and totally rubbish Blair Witch Project (also from 1999).<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie-let me warn you though that if you watch it alone be prepared for a sleepless night."

","After seeing the trailer from the 6th sense I didn't have the intention of going to see this film immediatly.Everything looked and sounded (the whispering in the trailer still gets on my nerves) very pottered. Thankfully the film itself is better made. In essence this is a simple story about to lost souls and their search for a comprehensive life. The film itself revolves around the surprise ending, which I didn't find surprising at all. In fact watching (and not looking) at this story gives away the ending about 45 minutes into the film. To achieve this ending a lot of scenes feel also pottered and unbelievable. Once again this is a film where characters and plotlines seem to revolve around the story,normally a story is build upon characters and the succession of events and plots. Still we are left with an interesting film thanks to M.Night Shyamalan great acting-direction and his visual flair. Some of the scenes are real terrifying examples of horror. Both Willis an H.J. Osment, cool, performances give the film an extra edge. But the real surprise was the performance of T. Collette. Her performance doesn't have one false moment as the even more scared mother. Even more rewards must be given to the director of photography for his stunning, but underrated, work.

This might also be Bruce Willis best performance in his career... And of course, I can't finish this paragraph without mentioning Haley Joel Osment... The little boy did a great performance in that movie, and he actually gets into his character a lot, representing Cole's feelings and fears.<br/><br/>This movie has a touch of ""something"" that is a bit hard to name for me, but it surely keeps everybody paying attention every single minute, since the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>Then we have that amazing final... Yes sir, that final that made all of us drop our jaws and refuse to believe what we just saw.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is that everything matches, because everything the kid said about the dead people are the same things that Bruce Willis does, like: He doesn't know he is dead, he sees what he wants to see (his wife...), he can't see the other dead people... Everything was perfectly planned by the writers of this movie, and I personally think the plot is fantastic.<br/><br/>I'll rate this movie with a 10 out of 10, of course."

","First off, Haley Joel Osment (plays Cole) is one heck of an actor.  His performance rivals that of Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"" and Henry Thomas in ""E.T."".  Osment brilliantly plays true horror and fear and I found it hard to believe that he wasn't truly haunted by unknowing ghosts.  The film is a visual masterpiece.  The use of the color bright red is so perfect and downright spooky that I can't see that cinematographer not getting an award. The story itself is great, but the final touch is the complete horror of the idea that you could be dead and not know it.  Rent, buy it, or watch it and think about it."

","By far the film that Bruce Willis has done in a while but that is not to say that he carried this film. Bruce really needs to let himself into roles like this more often. He wears them well. If he kept it up he could be the American version of Mel Gibson. Cinematography was solid and considering Tak was behind the camera, it doesn't surprise me. Young Osmet actually appeared to put some thought into his acting. Most child actors appear to be nothing more than parrots for the director, mimicking the commands of the script but not having the  experience or emotional base from which to truly act the scene. Not in this case. Haley Osmet did a wonderful job making his character emote. Have seen most of the better films of the year and so far this one captured me more than any of the others. I really truly believe that to honestly experience a good film you must go into the theater weaponless, bring nothing but what you are, your life experiences. Otherwise, the experience always becomes something that was preconceived and you guard yourself from participating in the story. This one rattled the chains of my fathers death while I watched it. Anybody who has had someone close to them pass on will connect to this film in varying degrees. Things left undone and unsaid and so on. It is a tender and meticulously, well thought out story and it *will* get you in the end. Go see it and try to honestly find anything wrong with it. Some of you may be able to pick out the plot early but it shouldn't disrupt your enjoying the film. Doesn't depend on overwhelming buckets 'O' blood or viscous, needless cursing and people lathering each other with their tongues or computer generated whiz-bangs.

","Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a successful child psychologist who's faced with the toughest challenge of his career when assigned to help a young boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment ) who is haunted by unknown demons. The director is the relatively unknown and young M. Night Shyamalan and despite his obvious talents the movie is a bit disappointing as a psychological thriller. The shocks are too far between and even too obvious and the plot, despite of a successful surprise-ending, does not hold up to minute scrutiny. But having said that it is important to emphasize that H. J. Osment is absolutely amazing as the haunted boy and stands out as one of the best child performances for a very long time. Bruce Willis is excellent as well, his performance is very quiet, almost  modest, and it suits him very well. But the outstanding performance of the film is without a doubt the breakthrough of the young Osment and personally I can't wait to see what the future brings for him. It's more than likely that ""The Sixth Sense"" will be remembered as the real beginning of an exceptional career."

There are plot holes galore, and the movie, in a nutshell, is contrived. People think that since the ending threw such a twist, it compensates for the uneventful majority of the movie. It doesn't. The movie is original, to a certain extent, but is hardly what everyone makes it out to be. I've heard people asking unintelligently, ""when was the last time I saw a movie that made me think? When was the last time I saw a movie that I discussed with my friends afterwards?"" I think a better question would be, ""When was the last time you saw a genuinely good movie?""

And you will go a considerable way down the path of enlightenment if you watch a movie like this. Everyone in the movie acts well, but little Osment really comes out tops.

The buzz deep inside you when you see a film so brilliant that no star rating, any review, anything could possibly convey how absolutely superb the film was. Well The Sixth Sense gave that feeling for the first time since I saw Death in Venice a while ago. Anyhow, the plot sees Bruce playing a child psychologist and a year after he is shot by a disgruntled patient in his home, he takes of the case of Harley Joel Osment, who has the sixth sense of the tile: the ability to see the ghosts of dead people. After Color of Night and Mercury Rising, the prospects of Willis playing a shrink AND working with a child are not good, but he is perfect for the role. Gone are is usual action man histrionics and instead he underplays the role calmly and gives a performance that is worthy an Oscar nomination at least. Child actor, Osment is superb too and mixes his role with sympathy, fear and desperation that put his performance among the child greats. ""Brat"", doesn't even come into the equation. As superb as they are, the most credit has to go to writer/director M. Night Shyamalan who skillfully handles his intelligent script and comes up with a chilling atmosphere throughout the film as well as several electrifying shocks, based on relatively simply situations.

","While it now seems to be impossible for any film - good, bad or indifferent - to escape the hype machine that declares it the greatest movie ever made, ""The Sixth Sense"" nonetheless holds up well. It is an intelligent, well-made thriller that can be genuinely frightening and moving by turns. Bruce Willis acquits himself honorably in a demanding role that requires him to do more than grit his teeth and show his chest hair, but the most impressive performances come from Toni Colette and child actor Haley Joel Osment. Most importantly, the plot is interesting, plausible and internally consistent, and even manages to survive the much-discussed 'final twist'. The 'final twist' is an over-used device in movies currently - for every film such as ""Wild Things"" (where the whole movie is one twist after another) or ""The Usual Suspects"" (where there is only one twist, but an immensely satisfying one), there are half a dozen others where a wholly arbitrary and gratuitous twist is thrown in 'just because'. The ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" is not arbitrary or gratuitous, and you get the pleasure of mentally reviewing the movie to see if it stands up in the light of the ending. To its credit, it does.<br/><br/>Possible spoiler: it may be interesting to compare this film with ""Jacob's Ladder"". Both films merge a sometimes bleak and usually realistic view of everyday life with genuinely disturbing glimpses of 'the other world' that do more than merely play the slime-and-gore card. And as viewers who have seen both films may notice, they have other ideas in common as well."

Haley Joel Osment is extremely effective as a guarded and serious 9 year-old boy who is burdened with the secret ability to see the dead.

Subtlety in movies is a welcome change these days, and this movie entices the viewer to use his or her imagination, which can be more frightening than ""seeing everything.""

Well, I give this film a 6 out of 10, although I thought a lot about giving it a 5. A huge disappointment -- but still a good film."

","Very few films have ever affected me so deeply.  From its disturbing and paralyzing aspects to those that move the viewer to tears, THE SIXTH SENSE is the finest film (that this aficionado has seen) to emerge from Hollywood in a long while.<br/><br/>Highlights include the wonderfully subdued performance by the terribly-underrated Bruce Willis (his versatility is uncanny) and that of Haley Joel Osment--up to this point still best remembered as the son of Forrest Gump in the Academy Award-winning film of the same name, who deserves an Oscar for delivering the finest child performance in film history.<br/><br/>Toni Collette also shines playing Osment's character's mother.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan, late into his twenties, shows a maturity at the helm of this production not seen from a director his age since Spielberg directed JAWS.  The surprise ending--which may remain a surprise to those who have not seen the film--is indeed wonderful.  Those who claim it is not that remarkable probably had watched the film *expecting* to see something shocking.  A viewer should imagine, after seeing the picture all of the way through, not having been expecting a surprise at all.  Only then perhaps will he truly appreciate the finale.  It becomes apparent that everything that seemed unimportant in the film, is actually the most crucial about it. A film that has appeared to be, and been advertised to be, about something terrifying, turns out to be something almost unbearably touching.<br/><br/>Best of all, and rarely mentioned in the reviews for the film that I have read, is the contribution of composer James Newton Howard--penning a dazzling score for this exceptional picture.  His score singlehandedly breathed life into the bleak future of film music (subsequent scores from the Baby Boom composers in 1999 have also been wonderful).<br/><br/>Overall a tremendous film that takes its time to unsettle and amaze its viewer.  It seems somewhat long and tedious upon its first viewing...but this is a film that demands multiple viewings.  I've seen it three times, and I could see it three more--it just keeps getting better.  It will be interesting to observe how well this film ages, and how and to what extent it will be appreciated years from now."

"BloodyEd","10","0","0","6 January 2000"," A true gem
","Where do I begin to sing the praises to this film?  The Sixth Sense is unlike anything I've ever seen, and by far the best film I've seen in years. Let me first say that I am no fan of horror films, and many classify this film as a horror picture.  It is not quite that.  One can get away with calling it a ""supernatural psychological thriller"" perhaps. To say that it is Horror however, is to put it in a genre generally known for its inferior product, and this film is anything but inferior. Unlike 1999's only other mentionable scare film, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense doesn't hide the terror from our sight.  We do see the ghosts that frighten Cole Sear so much.  And they are considerably scarier than the witch of the woods in Maryland.  But these frightening scenes are but one element in the overall success recipe of the film. <br/><br/>
Foremost I should mention Haley Joel Osment.  Only once before did a child actor really impress me.  I thought that Nick Stahl (in Man Without a Face) was outstanding.  But the depth and honesty of Haley's performance here I have yet to see the equal of.  He completely convinced me of his fear, and he invoked protective instincts in me I didn't know I had.  If there is any justice in Hollywood (yeah, right) he will AT LEAST be nominated for an Academy Award.  (If they could give it to Anna Paquin, they just might consider Haley).  In any instance, this little man has given a performance that many adult actors can rightly be very jealous of. The other performances are all outstanding too, and I'm sure now that no one could have betterred Bruce Willis in this role.<br/><br/>Then, the direction and photography are far superior to anything I have seen in ages.  The film is dark.  Literally black sometimes.  There is hardly any sunlight anywhere, and the rooms are all pale and depressing.  This is Cole's world, and we are put right in there the entire time. Shyamalan also sneaks some very clever shots in the back door.  Look for a trace of Cole's sweat vanishing from the table, his reflection in a shiny doorknob etc. These and many more find their way into the film, and every one of them fits perfectly where they are put.  In short - there is not a single frame out of place in this film.<br/><br/>The human elements are also strikingly detailed.  Note the parents at the school concert whip out their camcorders when they see their kids on stage. The cleverest scene of all, is between Willis and Haley.  They play a ""mind-reading"" game, and although one of them wins this battle of wills and wits, they both end up losing it in a way.<br/><br/>These are just a few examples of the quality that this film boasts.  It is an extremely well made and unbelievably well thought out suspense film. It has been years since a film has given me physical, literal chills, and this film has done exactly that.  It managed to scare me -- something that a macho twentysomething man like me wouldn't like to admit.<br/><br/>A final word:  firstly, if you plan on seeing this film, read as little about it as you can.  Do not talk about it with friends who have seen it, because the less you know about it the better.  Let it unfold and take you over in it's own time. And secondly, go see it in the theater if you can.  The unbearably tense music and huge dark screen add something very special to the experience.<br/><br/>I think this film is a masterpiece in its own right, and if you can appreciate a good story with terrific acting, go watch The Sixth Sense."

","Heard and read a lot about this movie and, well, it didn't really grab me. I felt the tension, but I wasn't sucked into it. It's a slow movie and I felt myself drifting away from it. There were some really eerie parts though, and I felt this movie was heading towards something. Something special. I'd already read this movie had a surprising final twist, so I was pondering on that throughout the movie. When the moment was there I was especially puzzled... I didn't even quite get it. When the actual end of the movie was there I got it and I was blown away by the ending. One of the best ever. In the days after I saw it I kept thinking about it. Wondering if the ending was in line with everything I'd seen before. As I said, the part leading up to the ending was eerie at some times, tensed, and it was good, but not great. Well, the more I thought of this movie (after I'd seen it), the more I realized how brilliant in fact it was. I decided I just HAD to see it again to see if it all made sense. Yesterday I went to see it for the second time. It was awesome. It was just SO cool to look at it, now knowing the final outcome. In fact, I was watching a whole different movie. I even felt more tension than during the first viewing. Right now I can say it's one of the better or best movies I've ever seen, like the Top 25 or so.

I had seen no trailers, nor read any reviews, in fact, the whole reason I ended up sitting in the theater was because I was out with a few friends and we decided to see a movie spur of the moment. Well ""the Sixth Sense"" being the only movie playing we decided upon it. (one of my friends having seen it several times.) As the movie began I was held riveted to my seat. The opening few scenes were excellently done. My heart, I must admit, actually stopped once or twice. I give my congrats to the writer and director and actors there... In addition, the final few moments of the movie were filled with a couple of excellent twists which re-captured my wandering attention. I say 're-captured' because I found the majority of the movie sadly lacking. The plot was thin and repetitive and the characters a bit shallow. After seeing something once or twice there was no need to show the same type situation over and over again.<br/><br/>I will admit to not being a horror movie buff, however, I will say that I have seen low-budget television horrors that held me more captivated than this.<br/><br/>I believe that one or two twists in the middle of the movie would have helped.

","It happened to me when I watched The Usual Suspects and Carlito's way and Shawshank Redemption. And it happened to me when I saw The Sixth Sense. I was lying flat on my back and sat up straight when it happened. If I could've seen my own face I can bet I would have never looked more bewildered than that moment. To me sixth sense was a good movie with superb acting and great direction five minutes before it ended. After those five minutes it transformed into a classic worthy of an Oscar nomination. It definitely has one of the best ends ever in the cinematic history.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis has taken a leap from being a good actor to being a great one. His talents were utilized to hilt by the debutante director M. Night Shyamalan. Bruce has proven that there is much more in him than we saw in action flicks like Die Hard series and Last Boy Scout.  It will be unfair not to nominate him for the Oscar. There haven't been too many performances better than his, this year. But of course the revelation is Haley Joel Osment. He has given a gem of a performance so early in his career. The fear, the confusion, the lack of confidence, was portrayed in a manner that cannot be faulted. Its amazing how someone so young can firstly understand, and then deliver such a complex character. Full marks to him for giving probably the best juvenile performance ever. (Apologies to all those Home Alone lovers) And finally lets talk about M. Night Shyamalan. There could be no better way to start a career. He has made an ideal first move in what should be a long shining career. He knows his job well but most importantly one can't help feeling that this is a film made by someone who has thought, ate, slept this one for ages. It must have been really close to his heart and it shows. Lets keep our fingers crossed that he won't be a one-film wonder."
"paladin-38","10","0","0","8 August 1999"," One of those rare movies that uses the conventions of a tired genre to to express a deeply humanistic vision.
","Within one month of each other, 2 watershed movies have opened that have, each in their own way, done more to shake the hoary old genre of horror movies to its foundations than any movies in decades. <br/><br/>One is the Blair Witch Project; the other is The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>The horror genre has been mired for some time in the baroque self-indulgence of superficial and ornamental special effects.  The Blair Witch Project has come along like the cinematic equivalent of punk rock---stripping away the self-indulgence to help rediscover the elemental core of the genre.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is quite another matter entirely:  it is quite simply a great pop movie----deeply felt, humanistic---and almost certain to be overlooked and underestimated.  It is a movie that uses the conventions of the horror genre, but bends them to its own purposes. Like the movie ET, which taught us that not all aliens are unfriendly invaders, and in so doing, liberated the alien/sci fi genre.......so to The Sixth Sense steadfastly refuses to view the spirit world as some adolescent frat-party of frights. Instead, it reacquaints us with the age-old lore that tells us that the dead shall walk the earth as long as their spirits are troubled.  The dead do not haunt the earth, and our memories, just to scare us---but because they want something from us, some grace note that gives their lives meaning, and settles old hurts and misunderstandings, but not in the immature and vengeful way that the horror genre had descended into.  And we the living want something from the deceased who have left us:  we want them to be proud of us, to give us their blessing. And so this movie, incredibly enough for a movie that plays almost straight with the conventions of the horror genre, is a subtle meditation about love and connectedness and relationships, between the living, and between the living and the dead.  It is a movie about redemption.  And one thing it helps to redeem is the genre that it arises from."

The relationships change, who is the savior/saved changes, and all of this results in a more complex and enjoyable movie experience. The acting is subtle and utterly believable.

","The sixth sense is not a movie that will try to scare you by means of visual or sound effects like in Haunting. It is a thriller masterfully directed and written by the unknown M. Night Shyamalan.

In particular, Haley Joel Osment's performance as the endued with the sixth sense little boy is excellent!<br/><br/>One future of the film that I will never forget is the unbelievably amazing end.

","I highly recommended this haunting thriller to my family and all my friends. It was great; most of all for three really important reasons.  First of all the ending twist is the best and most thought provoking twist in a horror film since Norman Bates was Mrs. Bates in ""Psycho""!!!  Because a film can not be judged on the ending alone, there are two other reasons why this film is the best horror film made in the 90's.  It's dramatic and caring.  I really cared for these characters even though it was total fiction; that's what really good films do best.  And I also enjoyed the terror and scary images in the film; they were very HAUNTING!  This is a great motion picture.  Only complaint; the Bruce Willis character leaves the boy too soon I think, I mean we are dealing with ghosts here; you would of thought he would of stayed with the boy longer.  Also the film is never truly climatic or absolutely enthralling.  But, all in all this stands as one of the best films of the year; it's on my top ten list!   <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense   ***1/2(out of four)   -   7/10"

","Being in Iceland we often get pictures few weeks later, after they're shown in the US. Most of the times we premiere them before or at the same time as in England or any other Europe country. Seeing the success in US made me very curious. Could Bruce Willis really act? Was this such a great movie, that both critics and audiences loved it so? With huge anticipation I finally got to see the film in October and although I expected something great, I didn't expect it like that!! The scripting, the plot, the directing, the acting ... is one of the best I've ever seen. I've always been fond of Bruce Willis films, the action and suspension. But this is by far his best film, his best acting, and most profitable! The star of the movie is Harvey Joel Osment, a true wonderkid, and if there ever was a justice in awards for acting, this kid should get some trophies. The script should be nominated too, plus Olivia Williams and Toni Collette. All are doing a great job and when you think about this film after you've seen... you get more and more convinced. This is arguably the best movie I've seen (besides Titanic) and I want to thank everyone involved in it for that. A true masterpiece. A true gem. A film you won't forget.

There seems though a marked difference in the promise of young Haley-Joel Osment who almost carries the brilliant 'Sixth Sense' on his own shoulders as the apparently mentally troubled Cole Sear.  Osment seems to almost inspire the likes of Bruce Willis to separately stellar performances.  Cole Sear claims to have the ability to 'see dead people', Willis is the child psychologist who helps Cole deal with his strange 'hallucinations'.<br/><br/>Willis' character, Malcolm Crowe is determined not to fail Cole in the way he failed an almost identical case years before.  Crowe eventually discovers the incredible truth behind young Coles claims in one of the films more chilling scenes involving a tape recording of a previous session with another 'psychic'.  Another scene which seemed to highlight the films Oscar potential involved Cole and his mother (played well by Toni Collette) caught in a traffic jam resulting from an accident, it is in this scene that the film reached its emotional peak and seems to reach out to anyone who has lost someone close to them without warning and with so much left unfinished.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is an emotional and truly hair raising, fine piece of work that contains a final twist that will drop your jaw and send you back for more.

"Rusty-61","Null","0","0","3 December 1999"," Surpassed my expectations- (SPOILER, though slightly subtle)
","My expectations weren't too high- I saw a matinee, just wanted it to be mildly entertaining. I had seen BWP a few weeks before and thought it was creepy, but overhyped, and not the scariest movie of all time like everyone said. I had friends who said they almost cried BWP scared them so bad. Well, there's one of many moments in this (there's so many that just made every hair on my body stand on end, my skin crawl, and made me actually gasp- and I can say that movies that only have 1 or 2 moments like that, I can probably only name 10 or so) I won't give the end away, but the moment that starts out with the  kid appearing to Cole and whispering excitedly, ""Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun""- that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of BWP put together. There were many times where I jumped, and it wasn't just a ""fake"" jump, it was something clever that I genuinely didn't see coming. As far as The Twist, first of all, I've decided when it's hyped that a movie HAS a twist ending, that's a drag right there, because you-well, I do anyway--spend at least half the time trying to guess the twist. Having seen a hell of a lot of movies, and a hell of a lot of twists, I usually get it 9 times out of 10. (BEGIN MINOR SPOILER) I guessed the twist in Jacob's Ladder, so...and it was already spoiled because I read a review that DIDN""T give a warning, but said, ""If you've seen Jacob's Ladder and Angelheart, you'll see this one coming a mile away""(END) I'm pretty much the spoiler queen, it's like heroin or something, maybe 1% of the time I can resist reading them, I don't know what it is. If I had to pick any movie where I could go back and not know the spoiler ahead of time, this would be it. My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too. Something else I did not see coming was how emotional this movie made me. I had a friend die on me without getting to say goodbye but was over my grieving, and if you've recently experienced the death of someone close to you (especially if you are not finished grieving) then in all seriousness, please think twice before you watch it. During the second to last scene in the car, I surprised myself by starting to cry, hard, and I didn't stop until the credits were partway over (and Bruce Willis is not one of my favorite actors). GOD that scene in the car got to me. Re-reading the screenplay, I realized even more how great it was, and how heartbreaking. There are so many elements that just make your heart wrench. I read the last scenes of the screenplay at home, alone, and had a really good cry, which hasn't happened since I read the screenplay to The Green Mile. Aside from that, again, this movie scared the crap out of me. The premise is very scary but they could have handled it in a way that bungled it up, but they did it just right. Even if you *really* don't like Bruce Willis' acting, and were turned off by the trailer, give it a chance. But don't be surprised if you need to sleep with the light on."

Its pretty much like Maltin says, ""the film is sinuous and creepy without being manipulative."" Haley Joel Osment is astonishing, never has a child actor been so convincing since Anna Paquin in The Piano, who was around the same age when she won her academy award. Osment makes the film seem all the more real. I haven't seen Bruce Willis this good since Pulp Fiction. Toni Collete is great too, (although i could hear her australian accent creep through on occasion). Unfortunately, I was already aware of the twist at the end, (thanks to a tv presenter who decided to be incredibly irritating to my country by broadcasting the twist just to annoy everybody!) but this didnt diminish the power of the final scenes, which were both creepy, and touching. Ive already heard from people that this movie ""sux"" and it ""doesnt have enough blood"" and ""it was boring"", oh and ""End of Days looks better"".

","Much has been made of the twist in this film. I don't know whether this says something about me or the predictability of Hollywood but from simply having some knowledge of what the film was about, I actually guessed what the twist would be before I had even seen the film. Given this hunch, it was really quite obvious as the film progressed that I was right -however even when it came at the end it was still packed with enough power that it sent a shiver through my body.<br/><br/>Credit then to the director, who accomplishes this, and the rest of the film with consumate skill. There are a few powerful moments in this film which should rightly go down as great moments in cinema. However if I was going to draw faults, I would say it takes too long for the plot which everybody already knows (that the kid can see dead people) to unfold, and that perhaps more could have been done with it one it has.<br/><br/>Still, great performances from both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the kid make this as believable as it could possibly be, and you're unlikely to see a better chiller than this in the next year.<br/><br/>Go see it."
"Chris-564","Null","0","0","1 December 1999"," Good stuff, done well.
","Hollywood's been getting better at producing more intelligent horror/thriller films of late.  I'm not sure what's going on; perhaps it's something they're putting in the bottled water.  Anyway - ""The Sixth Sense"" is a lovely example of what a ""taught psychological thriller"" should be all about.  Shyamalan's opus about a little boy and his counsellor hits exactly all the right buttons, and does so whilst cranking up the tension to an almost unbearable level.<br/><br/>It is not overly gory, it does not rely on hugely fantastic special effects to stun and amaze the audience, neither does it resort to clichÃ©d shock tactics.  It is a great example of a good idea for a good film cleverly executed.  The performances are good by all, but a special mention must go to Haley Joel Osment who plays a difficult and demanding role with the ability and talent of an actor five times his age.  Toni Collette is also superb as his troubled mother, and it is very refreshing to see her tackling such a diverse range of roles (including such films as ""Muriel's Wedding"", ""Emma"" and ""Velvet Goldmine"").<br/><br/>I will confess that the storyline was somewhat spoiled for me, as somebody I know (and now despise) had the stupidity to tell me what the twist was.  So, rather than appreciating what should have been an excellent exercise in astounding revelations, I sat through the movie thinking ""oooh, that's clever"" and ""of course, I understand why that happened"".  I feel rather cheated out of watching it for the first time, all in all, which is more than a little disappointing.  So, if you have seen the film, or you know the twist for some other reason, then keep your mouth firmly shut, and don't spoil it for others.  And therin lies the film's main weakness - it is extremely vulnerable.  A great deal of the film's effectiveness relies on the fact that people will not talk about it to other people who have not seen the movie.  And, as we know, people have a tendency to blab.<br/><br/>This gripe aside, ""The Sixth Sense"" gains a lot of praise (and deservedly so) for being a cunning little movie with a nice line in scaring the pants off you.  I feel that a great deal of praise should also go to the studios who produced this film (Hollywood Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment), for not leaving it to fester, or become a low-budget B-movie, a straight-to-video job, as it could easily have been.  These sorts of thrillers are ten-a-penny these days, and it's nice to see that they recognised Shyamalan's talent for writing and directing, and gave the project a budget, a distribution and a cast it deserved.  (Although one can speculate that it's reaping the rewards by taking in a phenomenal amount of money - rightly so, too).<br/><br/>The cinematography is well done, the soundtrack not too intrusive, and there are no appalling performances to spoil the rest of the movie's grandeur. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a good movie, pitched at exactly the right level, and it's a great night out at the cinema too.  Even my parents enjoyed it, so it must be doing something right!"

","This is probably the best movie I have seen this year. Everything about this flick was outstanding, especially the plot and the twist at the end.<br/><br/>Mr Willis is at his best in this, and the boy Cole with his 'sixth sense powers' is truly convincing. To have the ability to not only see the dead but speak with them must be terrifying for a boy his age (see what happens to the other boy Vincent)...<br/><br/>It was scary, but not meant to be a mindless gore fest, which made a great change from the usual Scream-like antics we see in movies today. Some parts really made the skin crawl, especially the things the boy Cole says (I'll leave it to you to see the flick) and sees. <br/><br/>It was awesomely acted, unlike some bombs that have been churned out this year! <br/><br/>Although it may not appeal to those who like blood and gore splashing all over the screen, I recommend this flick to all those who enjoy a truly frightening but tasteful movie."

The directing is excellent, and the cinemetography extraordinarily beautiful for a suspense/drama. The intriguing plot and excellent acting (by Osment and Willis, anyhow) make up for the slow pace.

"Pelle the Poet","10","0","0","26 November 1999"," A feel-good horror from an emerging master storyteller -- a masterpiece.
","""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of the young tormented boy Cole Sear (played superbly by Haley Joel Osment), child psychologist Dr. Crowe (played by Bruce Willis in for me the best performance of his career to date), and Cole's fiercely loyal mother Lynn (played by Australian Toni Collette).  I happened to catch Osment in an episode of ""Walker: Texas Ranger"" shortly before seeing this film.  He was a few years younger in that but his acting was uncannily affecting for such an unintelligent television program (its not surprising he was nominated for a Young Artists award for his performance).  He stole the show in that, as he did in this.  Everyone seemed to be commenting after the film on how good 'the kid' was -- including me.  I'd hazard a guess to say that he's one child actor who will maintain a strong acting career throughout his adolescence and into adulthood.<br/><br/>Told with genuine tension -- hats off to the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan -- occasionally you'll jump in your seat, a chill will run down your spine, and the hair on the back of your neck may even stand up.  The final dÃ©nouement was superb (and that's all I'll say about that).  In a word (or three), a must see.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is without doubt one of the best films I have seen for a long, long time.<br/><br/>If you loved this film, check out Shyamalan's previous film ""Wide Awake"", a feel-good comedy, also dealing with the spiritual.<br/><br/>Mr. Shyamalan -- you are a master storyteller."
"eastie","7","0","0","28 November 1999"," How come nobody's mentioned the Usual Suspects?
","It just surprised me a bit. The past few years have seen a whole bundle of 'twist' movies (Wild Things, Dead Man's Curve etc) where the final reel reveals new insights into the previous ones, but although none of them are bad movies as such, they've all seemed a bit too self-conscious - twists for the sake of it, rather than in order to genuinely stun the audience. Because you know that nothing is what it seems, you spend the movie trying to guess what the twist will be. The biggest effect it can have on you, therefore, is to mildly surprise you with the way things turned out. The success of the Sixth Sense is, like the Usual Suspects, that it only turns out to have a twist right at the very end. Most people I know who saw the Usual Suspects went to see a heist movie, and thought they'd got one right until the fateful pin-up-board-coffee-cup moment. Similarly, with the Sixth Sense, you get an effective and straightforward spooky movie which suddenly catches you by surprise. The movie has done such an effective job at this that I think it has been somewhat overrated.<br/><br/>First of all, I admit that I knew that a twist of some sort was coming (knowing that, it became quite predictable), which, by what I've said already, means that my appreciation for the movie was dulled because it couldn't completely surprise me. The flipside is that I wasn't so awed by the twist as to be blinded by the movie's faults. It's definitely a good film - maybe an '8', and the acting is superb (especially in the mother-son scene in the car), but it's nowhere near one of the all-time top 100 movies, let alone top 10. Two main points:<br/><br/>1. Once you remove the shock-effect of the twist, it's actually a very meagre tale. As many others have pointed out, the actual resolution of the boy's problem is given far too little weight -the film is unbalanced. Far too much of it is taken up by Bruce finding out what anybody who's seen the trailor already knows, and far too little actually deals with it.<br/><br/>2. If you argue that the twist cannot be removed from the story as a whole - that it is simply too central, then the film must be judged on how well it is integrated into what goes before. The brilliance of the Usual Suspects is that the twist and counter-twists of the ending both explain the previous events better than the previous narrative had. It all makes so much more sense. Although the Sixth Sense is pretty tight (the first encounter between Bruce and the boy makes more sense at the end, for example), there are nonetheless big gaps, like what happened in the time between the opening Donny Wahlberg bit and the ""The Next Fall"" new scene (sorry, I'm trying really hard not to give away any spoilers). I have bigger objections still, but I don't want to give it all away (a cop-out, I admit).<br/><br/>There are loads of good points about the Sixth Sense (the acting and the elegant direction spring most immediately to mind) which elevate it to the status of a damn good movie, but if you remove the once-only shock of the twist, what you're left with is not enough to make it a classic."

","I was happy with this movie pretty much across the board.  It worked as a scary/horror story (managing to be both frightening as well as disgusting, something that people often confuse). Although we don't get to see much of the story between Bruce Willis and his wife, it does have elements of romance.  Lastly, it's a good mystery -- why the heck are these ghosts bothering this kid?<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't see the ending coming, and I loved it.  I've talked to people who say ""Oh, it was obvious"", but all I can say is ""Everything's obvious after it's been spelled out in front of you.""  As for complaints that major pieces of 'plot' weren't described (what does the mother do for a living, where's the father), I guess I looked at this movie as if it were a play in which the interaction between Bruce Willis and the boy was the focus, and other things were merely added where they contributed to that story.  When I read Hamlet I don't ask myself what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were doing before the King summoned them, or whatever happened to Reynaldo.  Those elements aren't vital to the story."

But there was a great deal of human emotion here. Willis was very good...but, admittedly, I usually like him. Clearly, however, this was a defining role for his capabilities beyond cynical action hero. Haley Joel Osment was stunning. I wonder what else this kid can do?!? The mom was strong, too. I liked the way it was filmed...it moved at a pace that held my interest but didn't drive the film forward. It left room for the story to unfold. This was one of the better movies I've ever seen.

The Sixth Sense is another horror benchmark horror film.While all of the recent post-modern slasher flicks are only interested in scaring its audience,(as well as being witty and having beautiful people chased by psychopaths)this concerns itself with emoting feelings from its viewers.There are scenes(mainly between mother and child)that are genuinely emotional.The Sixth Senses reputation has so far built around the twist at the end.While it is well crafted,depending on how intensely you are watching it,you may(like me and many of my mates)guess it before it comes along. The Sixth Sense is a horror film,delivering moments of subtle creepiness,cringing nastiness(Cole locked in the attic room)but the scariest thing about the film is how good an actor Haley Joel Osment is.The best child actor since Macauley Culkin <br/><br/>gives the best child performance since Anna Paquin in ""The Piano"".Paquin got an Oscar for her eforts,Osment deserves one.As does Willis for his touching,layered performance as the child shrink unable to forget his past.The fact that The Sixth Sense works is testament to the talent of Bruce Willis,lets hope he can keep up the acting trend,and can continue to survive without the safety nets of big guns,string vests and Alan Rickman."

","A rather good film overall... it seems a little empty in places and generally uncertain in it's message to the viewer, but it maintains the attention well. S Some of the scares are pretty tacky and overblown, but with well-executed buildups. The twist is excellently planned, and suprised me - though it's a little odd that the fact revealed by the twist does not have a noticable effect on Cole during the preceding rolls of film. The performance of the adult cast, while convincing in themselves, is totally eclipsed by that of Haley Joel Osmet, who is simply SUPERB. Perhaps even the best performance ever by a child actor. Very, VERY intense, emotional, and moving - particularly the scene where he is locked in a cupboard at a 'friend's' birthday party. Toni Collette is the only other actor who comes close - The scene where she discovers a previously unknown truth about her mother is excellently played, despite the unusual setting for such a scene. Bruce Willis missed an opportunity with this however, playing little more than a (admittedly positive) variation on his recent characters' emotionally dry, squinty-eyed selves. Moreover, it seems a little like the filmmakers didn't get the time to include everything they wanted in this movie. I found it somewhat unconvincing that once Cole 'tests' the theory of why he is being visited, everything is suddenly perfectly cleared up, and the film ends after 15 minutes. No 'journey' by Cole, up to this point. Having said that, neither of those points detract significantly from this otherwise very entertaining picture. Go see it."
"Ed-E-2","9","0","0","20 November 1999"," Let's twist again
","What a good year. The Matrix put the thought back into action, The Mummy gave us fun adventure almost worthy of Indy himself, the much overlooked Go walked a great dramatic line between danger and humour, Blair Witch was incredibly inventive (albeit partly through necessity), and if my friends are to be believed Fight Club,  will in turns repulse and excite me.<br/><br/>Another movie to add to the list is definitely The Sixth Sense.  How nice it is to be treated to a mature subtle film for a change.  Although it's doubtful whether you could call Blair Witch or The Sixth Sense 'horror', the pair do make an effective anti-dote to the CGI tedium of The Haunting remake, reminding people that a film can live on in the mind long after the credits have rolled.  It is also worthwhile approaching both films in the same manner:  Ignore the hype, don't expect slick FX, just sit back and watch a nicely crafted little movie rather than the 'event' you were expecting.  Less is  more.  So here's to more less.<br/><br/>Unlike Blair however, there are a few traditional 'haunted house' tricks, mostly designed to startle the audience - someone suddenly walks in front of camera, or appears then disappears in the distance.  'Cheap' maybe, but also extremely effective as the camera is so still during the film that any unexpected movement becomes all the more obvious.  The two leads are great, Osment is suitably fragile after home problems and ghostly visits, and Bruce is nicely calm.<br/><br/>Problems?  Well, some scenes remind me in essence of Danny in The Shining, but hey, that was 20 years ago now.  A bit schmaltzy in places?  Maybe, but for the most part the overal tone remains dark.  It is also a little slow in places, but to be honest the final twist does reward your patience tenfold. And what about that twist?  Well, knowing there was one did send my mind into overdrive, and one of the (many) possibilities I came up with was correct, but it was still a shock when confirmed.  Long after leaving the theatre I was still remembering all the little details and important clues that totally passed me by, and with each new discovery my admiration grows.<br/><br/>Maybe on my visit to Fight Club I might just have a last minute change of mind and dive into Sixth Sense again."

"Philby-3","Null","0","0","20 November 1999"," Ghost story with heart
","American ghosts, like American gothic, seem to have been imported with a lot of other European cultural baggage into the New World (though the Indians had their own), but their basic modus operandi is the same. Ghosts linger after death only if there is some unfinished business, usually if they have died a violent death that remains unavenged. They are not terribly easy to communicate with. They are also guaranteed to drop the room temperature in the most overheated living room. And of course some people are much more sensitive to ghosts than others, having a ""sixth sense"".<br/><br/>
Ghost folklore is put to good use here in what is really an exploration of the relationship between a child psychotherapist and his patient, Cole, a sad seven year old whose parents have split up and who doesn't seem to be coping well. For that matter, the psychotherapist isn't coping too well with his problems either, his failing marriage and the memory of a patient who killed himself after. But once the Doctor accepts that the kid is really seeing things he is able to help, and he realises at the end that he has helped himself a lot too.<br/><br/> Although the whole film has a pretty sombre tone, set in a well-observed gothic but real Philadelphia the tourist brochures are not likely to feature, it finishes on an optimistic note. Sometimes the ghosts will be able to finish their business satisfactorily, and be on their way, leaving us to carry on our lives in our own way without being haunted by the past.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is cast as the Doctor. An interesting choice; he has been seen mostly as an action man zombie in violent thrillers (Die Hard etc). Here he is a zombie of a different sort, reflective, sensitive, concerned, guilt-ridden. He is greatly helped by a truly stunning performance by child actor Haley Joel Osment as Cole who communicates his character's pain so well we all suffer. You don't have to believe in ghosts to feel that no seven year old should have to put up with what this kid has to bear. In a lesser role, Toni Collette does a nicely observed caring but baffled mother, single, but coping (or would be but for Cole's problem). Olivia Williams rounds out the cast as the Doctor's wife, who, after flirting with the handsome help at her shop, takes to watching their wedding video when he's late home. Donnie Wahlberg (brother of Mark) also does a nice cameo as a deranged intruder.<br/><br/>The writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, an ethnic East Indian brought up by his doctor parents in Philadelphia, (and who has a cameo role as an emergency room doctor here), has retold a truly ancient myth in a subdued and sombre style unusual in a mainstream Hollywood production. His handling of the scenes between Doctor and patient is quite masterly. At the end we are left with a simple but often forgotten truth: Our ghosts are about ourselves and once we recognise that we can deal with them."

","It's been a long time since Hollywood made a horror movie that relied more on acting and characters than special effects and shameless gore.  Luckily for us, M. Night Shyamalan is as much a fan of Henry James as Stephen King, and his movie, The Sixth Sense, is a masterpiece of psychological horror that would make the writer of 'Turn of the Screw' proud. Shyamalan successfully resists the temptation to throw in cheap thrills, and instead focuses on the characters, how they react to their situation, and how they are changed by it.  The audience quickly sympathizes with the young boy who can see dead people, and the broken man who feels driven to help him.<br/><br/>Young Haley Joel Osment gives a performance that is more textured than any since Anna Paquin in the Piano, and Bruce Willis' familiar taciturn demeanour works well for him.

I have never seen more people jump or scream whilst watching a film.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this film is the way it merges so many emotions, you can't help but begin to care about the characters. This is all built up towards the end where one minute you are watching an incredibly emotional scene regarding Cole and his mother and the next you are left spinning by perhaps the most incredible ending to a film this decade.

It is quite simple enough, and if you haven't seen it, you've probably heard something about it, or else you wouldn't be here.<br/><br/>What really struck me about the movie was it's interweaving details.  If you've only seen it once, see it again.  Then you might notice the fact that Malcolm always has problems opening the cellar door; that Cole's mother never awknowledges Malcolm when he comes to see the boy; the looks Cole gives Malcolm when he asks him ""what is it that YOU want out of this?""; and other things.  The clues are all there, but subtly woven into the plot.<br/><br/>The acting was very very good also.  The young boy always portrays exactly what he is feeling--we can tell, and we feel sympathy and pain for his sake. Bruce Willis makes the perfect psychologist--he is calm and caring, and he doesn't give up.<br/><br/>The movie's surprise ending didn't catch me off guard--because I had been previously told.  But it was still as emotional and well done as I ever might have expected.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense really impressed me--and it made me think profoundly--few movies do that nowadays.  See it."

","The whole movie is centered around the ""surprise ending"". From what I've seen and heard, when one is surprised by the ending, and think that it's brilliant, one generally loves the film. But if you know the ending of Sixth Sense, this movie seems to drag on, and I was pretty bored most of the time. I just wasn't very interested in the surprise, and didn't find that there was much more to this film. <br/><br/>Good performances by Willis, Osment and others, and a few intense moments that were well directed, help to keep Sixth Sense from being as bad as it could have been. After seeing the ads, I though Osment would be real irritating, but he surprised me, and I think he will probably give us good to great performances for a long time to come. <br/><br/>Sixth Sense is rated as one of the best movies of all time on the Internet Movie Database. I happen to believe that the public should be able to judge movies better than that. <br/><br/>Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub"

","What a year at the movies, with the exception of The Haunting' and a couple of minor turkeys, I cannot remember a better year for cinema-going.  As the year plodded on I thought the best had come and gone until I saw The Sixth Sense', wow, what a brilliant film.  Everything about this movie is top notch from the acting, the story, and script, commendation has definitely got to go to the actors, everybody from Bruce Willis to Toni Collette (from Muriel's Wedding) were perfectly cast and all gave career high performances. The Sixth Sense' grabs you from the opening and doesn't let go until its fantastic conclusion, and for a fairly slow paced story you simply cannot take your eyes from the screen. If you like to be scared, this is the movie watch, forget all the garbage Hollywood has been shoving down our throats, Yes Scream' and I Know What You Did Last Summer', I am talking about you.  Lets hope that future productions use this style of chiller as a blueprint instead of the thoroughly unimaginative slasher' movies of recent years.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense' has got to be one of the top movies of the year, if not the decade.  I watched the film over a week ago and I still think about it, that's just how haunting an experience it is.   My highest praise goes out to everyone involved in the making of this unforgettable, excellent motion picture."

","First of all anyone who trashes this movie either doesn't understand the movie fully or doesn't want to understand. Every actor in this movie played an important role and gave brilliant performances. Particularly Bruce Willis in his first successful serious role, definitley his best and Toni Collete for a fantastic portrayal of a single mother.<br/><br/>Now lets get into it... This is not a scary movie, the main issue here is the afterlife which would probably fall into a supernatural/psychological drama. This movie is about one mans journey into the afterlife.<br/><br/>As we begin the film, we see the final moments of Malcom Crowe's life. Note how his wife Anna and him communicate. When Vincent Grey actually enters the scene notice the striking physical resemblence to Cole Sear.<br/><br/>Could they be the same person? It is possible, notice the voice simmalarity, of young vincent. This leads to a theory that Crowe's life is flashing before his eyes and has stopped at where Vincent  is a boy except his name is Cole yet they are the same person, however Crowe switches into the present every time he is with his wife. Which leads to questions like: Who is the young man Anna is with? Is it a younger Malcom? Why does Anna give this young man a first edition book?<br/><br/>Anyways back to the plot Crowe is confronted by a patient whom he has failed(Vincent/Cole?) before giving the chance to help, the patient shoots him and then himself. The movie begins one year after the murders. Crowe is waiting for Cole, and he is reading  a file similar to Vincent's. Heres a question: If Crowe has been dead for a year where did he get the file? How did he know about Cole?<br/><br/>The film then journeys into the building of Crowe and Cole's relationship, the problems and triumphs Cole and Crowe have during the process and the frustrations and understandings Cole has with his Mum.<br/><br/>
Notice how no one ever notices Crowe, yet Cole does. Can Cole See this? Does Cole Know Crowe is a Ghost? Now here are some things to think about: When Cole's Mum is looking at the photo's why is their no ghost's sprite when it shows the youngest picture of Cole? There are alot of first person views in Cole's house especially with his Mum,like she is being watched. These are all important but, pay attention to every scene Crowe is in and look at how he handles himself and how others handle him. He knows he is dead, he just forgets or wants to forget.<br/><br/>Cole sees ghosts they scare him, Why doesnt Crowe scare him? Crowe helps Cole with his problem, by telling him to listen to the ghosts and they will go away. Cole does this and he infact helps one and it goes away(crosses into the afterlife) he realises that he has a gift and he shouldnt be scared. He then helps Crowe with his problem, even though Crowe was dead he didn't know how to communicate with his wife. That really is Cole's role in the movie except one bit: How did Cole open so many drawers and cupboards so quickly? Did he infact do it? Why did the hand print appear then disappear afterwards?<br/><br/>Where as for his mum she just wanted to understand her son, and when she finally did he solved a grief she had for years and no bond could have been greater than her new bond with her son.<br/><br/>As for Crowe he is infact the main character, and the film is about him and how he helps a boy with a great gift that others dont understand, and how he deals with the fact he is dead.<br/><br/>The ending is a twist when watched for the first time, but when watched more than once it shows infact that even though Cole said ""people don't know their dead"" they do know they just dont want to admit it. The final moment is one of great WARMTH, LOVE, LIGHT and LIFE. The words he says here show that he in fact knew he was dead, HE JUST HAD A HARD TIME COPING WITH IT. This is a film of the ages and makes us think about death and the afterlife the way it should be looked at, this will forever be a film that will constantly bring up new things and intrigue us forever."

Bruce Willis proves that he can act without a dirty string vest, and he proves that there's talent in there dying to get out, with this film I think he's got his ticket out of the action hero genre.<br/><br/>Osment, the child star, is amazing. When he whispers low you can feel how scared he is, he genuinely looks terrified during the scary section. This child is more believable than a lot of so-called A-list stars.<br/><br/>This is another clever film, it manages to avoid stock scare tactics and over the top ""I'm over here"" signs in the story, it's a huge surprise, and I loved it.<br/><br/>Go see this film, pray you don't catch any spoilers as I did, and go see it.

"Budd-5","9","0","0","13 November 1999"," Not a horror, it's a scary drama!!
","Sixth Sense is not a horror film. It's about ghosts and possesses a number of shocks that will levitate you from your seat but it's not a horror movie. This is a drama about a kid who can see the dead and the psychologist that tries to help him.<br/><br/>The film opens with Bruce Willis and his wife (Olivia Williams) celebrating his achievement of winning an award for outstanding work as a child psychologist. The night is interrupted by a former patient who Willis failed to help. He attacks Willis before killing himself.<br/><br/>A year on and Willis has a new patient named Cole played by the outstanding Haley Joel Osment. Willis sees in Osment a chance to make amends for the patient who he let down a number of years ago. From here on there are two plots both revolving about a family. The most interesting of which is that of Osment's. He keeps many secrets and refuses to tell his mother. He confides in Willis; he has got an ability to see the living dead. This ability has to be the most frightening that a child would ever have to face. The other less interesting plot concerns Willis and his wife who seem to be be growing apart.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan proves himself capable as both writer and director. He uses strange camera angles to suggest the eerie nature of Osment's dilemma. His writing is also adept; it is surely Oscar-nominated material. The opening 45 minutes are quitely effective before the film really grips you. The finale is successful in what it does. It was purely designed to promote the film's chances at the box office, and it seems to have worked."

","Wow, there sure are a LOT of comments for this movie! Anyway, overall I thought it was fantastic, since it was quite refreshing from regular action films, and the whole plot (to me) was quite satisfying. Most people have already said what I wanted to say, but I wanted to contribute my two cents too. ^.^ Actually, in quite a few bits, e.g. Cole busting to go to the toilet, etc, made the whole (packed) cinema laugh.<br/><br/>The only downside to the movie was that even though I was only seeing the movie for the first time and hadn't read anything on the internet or any spoilers (not even this page yet) concerning the ending, and yet because ONE person told me there was a twist at the end of the story, halfway through I guessed what it was, and kept hoping I was wrong but I had guessed correctly! (which kinda took away most of the suspense) But still... and also after reading the other comments, isn't Haley Joel a main character, not a supporting actor? (I mean, if he got nominated for an Oscar, which I think he should too) He sure stole the show from Bruce Willis... ^_^ Anyway, the filmmakers were quite smart because now I want to see the movie again, in the point of view of KNOWING for sure the ending and trying to make sense of it during the movie... If you haven't seen it, DO go see it, and don't try to guess the ending, just WATCH the movie, okay? ^.^"

","Wow.  That's what I can say about this movie.  The only other movie I can remember with a surprise twist was The Usual Suspects.  I had trouble following that film's twist and turns in the plot.  The Sixth Sense goes with simple-fashioned storytelling.  No big sidetracks to the story and just follow the characters from beginning to end.  It's hard to describe what I think of the film's major plot points without in effect dropping hints.  All I can say is the mood isn't so scary, although it is creepy.  But it would be surprising if this film at least won't be nominated in the Oscars for Best Screenplay.<br/><br/>The verdict: 5 of 5 stars.  This is the best film I've seen so far this year."

","Excellent ghostly horror film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, cleverly plotted and beautifully photographed, with moore than a few chills and twists.  A surprisingly superb performance by Bruce Willis(""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Last Boy Scout"") as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries desperately to cownnect with a reclusive, ostracized young boy, equally well-played by newcowmer Haley Joel Osmet.  I say surprisingly superb in regards to Willis, who for once shows a level of depth and refinement previously not allowed him by the cardboard characters of his bone-headed, fx-ladened action movies (""Armageddon"", ""Die Hard"").  ""The Sixth Sense"", like the earlier ""Blair Witch Project"", has become an instant horror classic, thanks largely to the wonderfully written script of Shyalaman, a heretofore largely unknown talent from the outscirts of Philly. His story eschews gory, cliched action-horror, and goes for the intellectual side of the supernatural.  Well-done, genuinely frightening, and lots of fun, the MooCow says grab some popcorn & check out this ghastly goody!  :"

","Well, where should I start talking about this movie? Before I saw it, I've heard so many positive things about it, especially its surprising twist at the ending. So, then I thought that this must be a must-see film, and I decided to go and see it on the first day it was released in Australia. It was so unbelievably packed in the cinemas that almost every session was sold out on that day, and I truly had some difficulty in buying the tickets. And, the most important thing, after watching it, I was truly amazed and absolutely impressed by the movie. Brilliant original idea and marvellous performance by its actors, everyone who worked on this movie must be very proud of it. Little wonder, it has brilliant script, supported by extraordinary performances and it makes every actor in it look extremely good, especially Haley Joel Osment, Bruce Willis and Toni Collete, the leading actors...... So far, I have seen it three times, and I will be definitely going back again to watch it. The second and third time around were even better, although the surprising ending part was no longer a big surprise anymore, but really, the ending is truly the one to die for. Each time I watched it, I was truly touched by the ending and my tears just nearly burst out...... Enough said, definitely go and see this movie.... This movie will really touch your heart, even though it might not be the scariest movie you've ever seen....But without the help of any special effect, this movie does a very good job in scaring everyone out of the seats (just compare it with THE HAUNTING, it makes THE HAUNTING look like an absolute joke).... One more thing, if it doesn't get any Oscar nomination next year which I think it deserves much (Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Script), it will be a huge tragedy for the film industry.......

","I have a sense that I have seen the sixth sense before,  then again I have seen ""The Matrix"" in countless other films.  It doesn't necessarily mean thats bad.  The plot basically revolves around the boys discussions with the psychiatrist (Bruce Willis) and the interaction mainly between these two characters is at the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>The film is difficult to label.  It isn't a horror,  although there are some scary moments,  its not a thriller though at times it is quite thrilling.   I would class it as a supernatural drama.  Its a strangely uneven film.  I really don't know where it actually goes and what it is trying to say. Is it about the effects of loss? as the child is suffering badly because of his parents divorce.  I felt that the scenes involving the children in the film were excellent .  The loneliness and isolation of childhood is remarkably well presented.  The scene in which  the children at the party lock the boy in a cupboard is very painfull to watch.<br/><br/>The performance by the leadinbg actor and no it is not Bruce Willis but Haley Joel Osmet is sensational.  He gives a wonderful , sensitve performance.  He is neither cloying or ""cute"".  I loved the scenes between the boy and his mother.  Toni Collette who plays the mother is excellent in this too.  The scene where she and the boy discuss her mother  who is dead but has given the boy a message for his mother) is excellent.  Its extremely emotional and real.  In some films it can be difficult to believe in a relationship between two characters but I really felt that these  were mother and son.<br/><br/>There are major gaps in the film,  not least the ""twist"" but overall I liked it.  I also wondered why the boys parents had divorced and where was his father.  Its never really explained and the boys feelings about his father are never unearted.  What does the mother work as?  This is never explained either.  The reason I ask this is that she seems so out of place at the childrens  birthday party scene compared to the other mothers.<br/><br/>The relationship between the Willis character and his wife is never fully developed and is quite frankly uninteresting.<br/><br/>Overall an effective "" supernatural"" drama with some fine performances and some scary moments."

","This is good stuff, but since there are already so many comments, I'll be brief:<br/><br/>The direction is excellent - everyday buildings sprout monstrous gargoyles (I don't know if everyone spotted it, but there is a moment near the beginning where the skyscrapers in the background appear to have demonic, grinning faces); subdued or oblique lighting intensifies the air of menace; the shocks, few though they are, are impeccably timed.<br/><br/>One should praise Tak Fujimoto and James Newton Howard for their excellent contributions.<br/><br/>The performances are restrained, but not bland. Colette is at her finest, as usual. Haley Joel Osment is a revelation, one of the best child performances ever (note the bit in the church where, from the balcony, he talks to Willis with the weariness and sarcasm of a much-lived adult).<br/><br/>THAT twist...well, it's reasonably unpredictable, but it's a shame it isn't really developed. In fact, the film seems to disappear into a blandness at the end which reminds you it was made in Hollywood - which is a shame, after so much good value along the way. And, as you think about the twist, you realise it's actually illogical. Oh, well, I'll say no more about it.<br/><br/>Overall, the film will be compared to Blair Witch, though it doesn't resemble it much. What it's really like is a cross between The Shining (which is inferior) and The Innocents (which remains superior, because it is much more bitter and chilling). In fact, the appearance of the first ghost in Sixth Sense so closely resembles a moment in The Innocents, that I can't believe it's not been copied. Still, this is not really a criticism - this is fine, intelligent, thoughtful film-making, and how often does that come from a studio picture these days?"

Before seeing this film I had been told there was a big twist at the end but I did not know what it was.  All through the film I tried to guess.  I came up with the final twist but rejected it a couple of times.  It is just too incredible.  Now that is saying a lot when the two premises on which the film is based are that some people can see and commune with ghosts while others cannot and that ghosts can move physical objects.

Because Malcom is able to help Vincent/Cole, there is no reason for Vincent/Cole to kill Malcom, which breaks the cycle, so Malcom is in truth never killed.  How do I know Vincent and Cole are the same person?  They both have a bunch of white hairs and both say the same thing, ""Do you know why you are afraid when you're alone?--I do.""  <br/><br/>Lee"

","I have recently seen ""The Sixth Sense"" and would like to applaud it's actors and makers as having produced one of the finest films to come out of Hollywood in a long time.<br/><br/>This movie was written and directed by an ""artist"".  It is a beautiful piece of work, so rich in subtleties and at that same time, bold and personally involving.  This movie is beautifully paced, for those of us who like to be coaxed into a story.  Before long you realize you are much further involved with these characters than you expected.  I must take exception with the crowd who found it ""slow"" and ""boring"".  Perhaps they are too used to being bombarded in the ""MTV"" style of film presentation.  If you enjoy being ""invited"" into a story rather than having it thrust at you in mind numbing picture flashes and sound effects then you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>This is not really a Horror picture at all.  It is a thought provoking study of characters faced with a question:  Can I truly say I know all about what I am seeing?  It is a wonderful journey of discovery as seen through the eyes of one small boy and one grown man, each facing the unknown.  This movie has the remarkable ability to make you think you have seen something when in fact you haven't.  See it twice and find out...."

","For a change, this is a ghost story that does not rely on over-drawn special effects or excessive gore.  What remains is a well-crafted script attached to a remarkable film.  This movie is genuinely frightening, in ways that I haven't seen in years.<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple on the surface.  Bruce Willis plays a troubled psychologist who has difficulty communicating with his wife.  He takes on the case of a child who is frightened by something mysterious and who also resembles a case that went horribly wrong, resulting in a break-in and a shooting.<br/><br/>When the little boy tells Willis that he can see dead people, the movie becomes remarkably chilling.  It is a sort of thrill ride without a hack-and-slash plot, leading up to a surprise climax that is worthy of written speculative fiction.  All of the leads perform marvellously, and are truly convincing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only flaw is that once the surprise twist has become known, several fairly large plot holes arise as one thinks back on the film. However, this is a remarkable enough film that they do not detract horribly from the experience.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing, and worth the money for admission. 4/5."

","Okay, so you're in the reviews section of IMDb, so that means that you are a bit of a film buff, so by this time, even if you haven't seen the movie, you have already read somewhere that there is a huge twist at the end, so I'm not spoiling it to you by telling you ""there is a twist"", am I?<br/><br/>Well, the trouble is, I am. European audiences have heard about the success of this movie in the States, and have heard about there being a twist, so most of us see it expecting it to come. And if you expect it, it is really quite obvious and easy to figure out long before it happens, there are many hints (put there so that everything makes sense at the end, of course). And it's not even such an original idea, we've seen similar things in other famous movies (which I won't mention so as not to give away too much). The whole movie relies very much on this final revelation, and until it comes, it just doesn't have anything consistent to say, there is never any real feeling of menace, which surely is the worst that can happen to a horror film(I do think, though, that the performances are quite decent, especially Osment's, given the difficulty of his role. But the pace could certainly be better). So if you see it without being surprised by the ending, the whole thing doesn't seem so impressive. A bit empty really. OK, but nothing extraordinary.

"Arnie-30","Null","0","0","6 November 1999"," Nice trick but a poor performance
","'The Sixth Sense' presents a unique problem for the reviewer.  Its most outstanding feature is a directorial subtlety which deceives the audience right up to the last five minutes and then forces a re-evaluation of the entire film.  Unfortunately this subtlety, which is undoubtedly the film's strength, has to remain unexplained.  Suffice to say that for many people the highlight of 'The Sixth Sense' will be its conclusion - a fact which betrays the flaws in the film.<br/><br/>'The Sixth Sense' lacks both pace and purpose.  Its basic premise is replete with possibilities but none of these are explored.  Characters are poorly drawn and lack depth.  Apart from the above mentioned 'twist', much of the direction is mediocre.  The film contains a few obligatory shocks but fails to maintain suspense.  It is a film which continually seems to be about to get going but then grinds to a halt.<br/><br/>The resolution of the film in relation to Haley Joel Osment's character is unsatisfying and lacks a necessary catharcism.  The performances of Bruce Willis and Toni Collette are lacklustre owing the deficiencies of the screenplay and the direction.  Even the film's raison d'etre - the last five minutes - is telegraphed to such an extent that the discerning viewer will work out what the 'sting in the tail' is to be.<br/><br/>Despite this, it is almost inevitable that 'The Sixth Sense' will be a highly regarded film.  Like 'The Blair Witch Project' it contorts reality to such an extent that the deceived viewer is forced to admire it rather than accept the fact that it has exposed the gullibility of its audience."

","""The Sixth Sense""<br/><br/>When Bruce Willis decides to act, it's an important occasion. When slogging through misfires like ""Mercury Rising"" and pure junk like ""Armageddon"", Willis never gets a chance to show the more dramatic side to his personality. ""Sixth Sense"" is the first product of the new Willis-no-guns philosophy that Bruce recently has made public. While it aspires to be ""The Exorcist"" for 1999, ""Sixth Sense"" can only muster the atmosphere of an off episode of ""X-Files"". A downright incomprehensible thriller that is too concerned with mood to care about the laughable story.<br/><br/>The real star of the picture is young Haley Joel Osmet (the easy bio is to say Forrest Jr. in ""Forrest Gump""). He plays a young boy named Cole who has the ability to see the dead. The life-challenged repeatedly harass and torture him to a point when the entire world the surrounds Cole views him as a freak. While his mother (gifted Toni Collett) cannot understand the secrets Cole keeps, a child psychiatrist (Willis) finds himself drawn to help the young child. The two set out to crack the mystery of why Cole is the chosen one.<br/><br/>Written and directed by first-timer M. Night Shyamalan, the film has all the trappings of a debut movie. It's careful with every detail, visually flat, and has trouble sustaining interest throughout. What the film does just right is creating some creepy moments. Moments that could have forced the film to take a more disturbing note, thereby making the movie memorable. What Shyamalan does is punctuate each heightened situation with a orchestral bang or any other Dolby scare tactic used by every modern film to grab a scare. I keep wondering why directors do this. Sure, it gets a jolt out of the audience, but it's an easy one that isn't earned. A real horror film shouldn't have to lower itself to get a fright out of the audience. In the end, ""Dolby scares"" do more harm than good. ""Sixth Sense"" had the goods to really disrupt the audience, instead it hits all the same notes.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis swearing off action films might be the worst mistake Willis has made. His best work has been in this genre (the ""Die Hard"" series) and giving it up leaves him with a plethora of father and psychiatrist roles to play for the rest of his career. We meet a kinder, gentler Willis in ""Sixth Sense"". It's a performance that isn't among the actor's best, yet is far from an embarrassment. Willis plays his character rather muted, never once opening up for the big emotions. You could say that was his character, but I suggest that Willis just doesn't know how to play anyone who doesn't have an urgent situation to take care of. I love Willis, but ""Sixth Sense"" doesn't require much from the actor except pursed lips and a really obnoxious hairpiece. Ten year old Haley Joel Osment, on the other hand, has a remarkable depth and range for a child his age. It is his acting that grounds ""Sense"" emotionally. I enjoyed his work here very much, and a simple scene of mother and son bonding in a shopping cart clearly showed the chemistry Osment shared with on-screen mom Collett.<br/><br/>A victim of crass Disney mismarketing, ""Sixth Sense"" isn't really much more than a light thriller with demonic overtones. Shyamalan's script often goes on wild tangents. Scenes with Willis and his wife (shockingly unused Olivia Williams, seen last in ""Rushmore"") that are supposed to pay off at the end of the picture are left wide open for questions dealing with simple logic. Another moment in which Osment helps a little dead girl to justice seems from a different movie. The entire film appears to make little sense, yet to question what you're watching is obviously not the point. Shamalyan's script is also without dialog, just characters delivering speeches to each other. It's all tiring after an hour or so.<br/><br/>Like this summer's ""Arlington Road"", the entire film hinges on a last minute plot twist. A twist that is supposed to knock you off your feet. While I was surprised by the ending, it's such an illogical and implausible plot turn that it's hard not to laugh at it. Coming out of the film I was disappointed in the PG-13 ""Sense"". The next film to try this plot (Scorsese's next, ""Bringing Out The Dead"", features a similar idea) should just try to take the material more seriously, give it a chance to creep us out instead of forcing it. ""Sixth Sense"" is just another forgettable thriller.---------- 3"

","Some people have powers of perception beyond the normal range of the five senses.  The movie explores this strange phenomenon. Most scenes in this film are dark and shadowy with the camera moving stealthily through doorways, stairways, cellars and attics.  I was on the edge of my seat most of the time not knowing what to expect next but knowing full well that there was something threatening in the shadows.  Several times I leapt in my seat which says a lot for the development of the spooky atmosphere and fine direction.  At first the story is rather confusing because not everything is revealed in the beginning.  It's a case of mental gymnastics as we sort out the clues concerning the various characters.  Bruce Willis is great and his scenes with the young boy hold our attention as we delve into the various possibilities until finally the truth is revealed.  In the opening scenes with the psychopathic intruder we experience our first shock but there are more to follow.  The psychopath shouts too much thus blurring his speech which makes it difficult to comprehend his words.  I enjoyed the argument with the school-teacher in the room which was once a court-house and the ""locked in the attic"" scene which scared everybody including the audience.

","The Sixth Sense', a psychiatrists salvation, a young boys nightmare.<br/><br/>In what would seem a twisted and even terrifying situation a seamless bond develops and will leave you wondering why such beautiful artistry and compassion is not in all of us.<br/><br/>A psychiatrist, with a passion for his work, vows to help a young boy tormented by the unseen ghosts, restless souls of the earth, after being shot by a previous patient in his own home that showed the same symptoms. After an initial rocky start the boy and man form a deep bond and Cole (Osment) finally decides to reveal his secret to Malcolm (Willis).  Nothing prepares him for the secret and nothing will prepare him for what is to come.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, in which may possibly be his greatest performance, gives his character a depth in which you can sympathise with, even understand what is going on in his life, in his head, as he comes to grips with the revelation of what Cole (Haley Joel Osment) exposes to him.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment is incredible in this film. His character is so intense that you can feel your fingernails digging into your skin waiting for his response to the frightening life he must live.  He shows you a world, which may, or may not be there, causing your heart to jump and you to shrink back waiting for the outcome of what he sees.<br/><br/>I admit that the movie is not for all audiences and you have to be prepared for what appears on the screen, but in saying that, the movie is not terrifying like I have read in most reviews and comments.  Maybe it depends on your constitution.  It is more thrilling than horror.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense' is not a Friday night amusement.  But if you want something that lets you walk away thinking of what just flashed in front of your eyes, then it is the movie for you, but if not, stick to The Haunting' for cheap screams and amusement."

It'll give you some scary sequences, huge surprises and great acting from Bruce Willis and the boy who portrays Cole.<br/><br/>The first part is a little slow. But you need to establish the characters' psychology and the way they're going to interact.

It had a large budget and it features my favorite Hollywood actor, Bruce Willis (if you've only seen him in the Die Hard series  - it was awful - you should try ""12 monkeys"", ""Pulp fiction"", ""The fifth element"", ""The bonfire of the vanities"" and so many great movies Willis has made).

","I had no advanced warning of Sixth Sense, and was frankly unexcited with the prospect of seeing Willis in this. However, I did like him in ""Death Becomes Her"" and it seems that death works well for this actor.<br/><br/>The storyline is right out of Robert Monroe, except that in this case the soul of the angel stays in the body. Instead, we are treated to Cole's visions of horror - a sight no one else is privy to. You watch with deep interest, wondering if this one can be cured - and at what cost...<br/><br/>Watching Willis' character follow this boy (excellently portrayed by a fine young actor I hope to see more of), we see his wife stop speaking to him and how his home life is changed. We see the boy's real fear of his visions, we learn to see him not as a monster at all, but a perfectly normal little boy who just can't tell anyone - at least not yet - why he is so tormented. His ""DO NOT ENTER"" tent in the bedroom is a great touch - a hiding place in so many ways. Plenty to fear here.<br/><br/>Most of my complaints about this movie evaporated upon the arrival of the credits. However, there is still one scene which, although not genitally explicit at all, still seemed extraneous. Just because little boys pee in a Sandler movie doesn't mean it is in. I just didn't want to watch that; although it did maintain focus, I would have preferred another way.<br/><br/>It is a rare movie I recommend to my friends. This one I do."

"Buddy-51","7","0","0","24 October 1999"," solid suspense film
","The concept of people who are able to see the dead has served as the foundation for any number of suspense films in the past, including the greatest horror film of all time, 1962's ""Carnival of Souls.""  Now comes the most commercially successful of such films, ""The Sixth Sense,"" which, although it does not begin to approach the quality of that earlier film, still emerges as a solid supernatural thriller that eschews graphic violence and gratuituous gore for understatement and thought-provoking creativity.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis stars as a renowned child psychologist who has just been awarded a major honor by the city of Philadelphia where he works and lives. On the same night, however, a former child patient breaks into his house and shoots Willis while his terrified wife looks helplessly on.  Cut to a year later as a recovered Willis pursues his latest patient - a troubled child who harbors a terrifying secret: he is, for reasons unbeknownst to anyone, able to catch fleeting glimpses of dead people, whom the little boy argues, are not aware they are dead.  As Willis begins to slowly learn to believe the child, a warm relationship of mutual trust and bonding develops.<br/><br/>It is this concentration on character rather than the more customary grue and gore that separates this film from so many other horror films of recent vintage.  Also, the director manages to create and sustain an atmosphere of slightly off-kilter otherworldliness through the use of visual correlatives: the eternally grey October sky, shots of creepy statuary or gloomy buildings caught at odd angles, a lyrical use of shadows, leaves blowing forlornly along an empty, windswept street, a glancing glimpse of a graveyard as it momentarily catches a frightened child's sight as he races by on a city bus.  It is these moments, taken as a tapestried whole, that give the film its cumulative suspenseful power.<br/><br/>As to the film's widely heralded surprise twist ending, it will come as less of a revelation to those with a knowledge of such films as ""Carnival of Souls,"" ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Ghost"" from which ""The Sixth Sense"" seems to derive much inspiration.  Still, the audience does leave the film feeling that it has, at least, been in the hands of a group of filmmakers who respect its intelligence and have carefully thought out the elements of the narrative before rushing the production before the cameras.  In this day and age, that is a rare treat indeed."

I don't think it was a bad film, the kid was riveting I guess but overall it was a big disappointment. I'd seen the huge American box office and heard all the hype and I really was expecting the best film of the year and it wasn't even the best film I've seen this month. (I would rate Election, An Ideal Husband, and American Pie higher than this) I figured out the twist pretty quickly and was completely detached, almost to the point of boredom. I though the flashes of dead people weren't at all scary. It was original in that it had a child as the protagonist but this idea has been explored many times before. I would only give it a 6 out of 10. I had an annoying audience in the cinema which probably didn't help but I am dumbfounded at this average film's popularity.

","Most horror/thriller movies see how far they can go to scare the hell out of a person. They'll usually start with a grisly murder, or something that foreshadows the many grisly murders that will occur during the movie. Though this formula can sometimes be effective, it gets old and sour faster than you can scream bloody murder.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense, however, defies all the conventional horror rules. Instead of putting together a series of unlikely events that ends up as a bloodbath at the end, it slowly draws the audience into its web of mystery and thrills. Though it does start with an event that foreshadows events in the movie, it does it in a way that nobody will expect. In a tense yet nuanced style, it keeps you enthralled in the plotline while finally blowing you away at the end.<br/><br/>The performances are Oscar-caliber, at least by 11 year old actor Haley Joel Osment. Though Bruce Willis's performance isn't bad (and a very refreshing change from his usual action fare), its this kid that carries the movie, and drives the emotion home. Highly recommended."

Throughout the show I was entranced and felt deep concern for Cole (Haley Joel Osment).  I was amazed at his strength and consideration for not worry his mother with his secret.  The storyline was unusual and not something that you see often in the movie mainstream but it was enticing and well worth the price of admission.  The ending left you wanting to watch it again and make more sense of parts that at first seemed eerie and strange. The acting was outstanding with proof that Bruce Willis can do serious roles and Haley Joel Osment is an amazing talent that has only recently been recognised.

","Although this is a fine movie, it is one of the most overrated by audiences in recent years.  Among the film's main strengths are the stunning performance of child actor Haley Joel Osment and by the young actress who plays his mother.<br/><br/>The script is very clever but also very, very sentimental.  This is not to say that the scene near the end of the picture when the boy connects on a new level is not moving--it is.  But the ending of the story of Willis's character is more effective as a stunt than as a source of honest emotion.<br/><br/>I will say, though, that the scenes intended to be scary are really, really scary.  This owes largely to Osment's performance, which draws us into complete identification with the haunted child at the movie's center.  It is also a credit to the screenwriter/director, though the movie's scares are never adequately integrated with the gooey emotion at the movie's heart.<br/><br/>I recommend THE SIXTH SENSE, but I insist that it is not the ""great"" movie that current popular sentiment suggests."

Haley Joel Osment is his new charge, a child who simply can't fit in with his peers with a very different way of looking at things.

","It has been more than six weeks since I have seen this movie. In that time I have seen five or six movies in theaters, and that many or more on video.<br/><br/>This had far more impact on me than any of them (including American Beauty) - that's how good, unusual, and resonant it is.<br/><br/>This is not just another horror movie, or just a horror movie with a twist. What it amounts to is a journey that the viewer doesn't know he is taking. Most horror films leave you at the end with a feeling of dread, relief, or remembered shock, but this is the first horror movie that filled me with joy at the end - and that's the most amazing thing about it. The other amazing thing is the sheer intelligence of this script throughout.<br/><br/>
I'm not as impressed as some with Willis's acting - I thought it was serviceable and filled the bill. It was, however, great casting, because having him in there made the viewer start to expect a real ""Night of the Living Dead"" gorefest climax - Bruce against the zombies! Light the torches! - concealing the true nature of this movie until the end. But Osmont's acting - and the way he was directed - had me completely sympathizing with him; both his fright and bewilderment, and his later courage in being able to talk to the unwelcome visitor in the playhouse, were entirely convincing and moving.<br/><br/>I will see this movie again; I don't think it's making too much of it to say that it's got enough ambiguities and layers of meanings to justify repeated viewings. I don't think that it will get the Oscar for Best Picture of the year; it may not even be nominated, and I'm not certain that it will deserve it. It's clearly not an Oscar-oriented picture, in that it doesn't have the Big Gesture, the Good Costumes, the Big Sinking Boat, the Grand Theme, the Anthony Hopkins appearance, and not a strand of classical music in sight or sound. But seeing it was one of the most moving moviegoing experiences I have had in a long time, and I hope that at least the script and Osmont get Oscars.

Its soundtrack does a lot of this, since the music is discreetly put in the back ground, with a Jaws-like feel, peeking at the most suspenseful times. However, as it is in some movies, it doesn't do it all.  The very feel of the movie is dark, with everything leading up to everything else.  Plot twists are numerous, and you are always guessing what is going on, BUT YOU RARELY GET IT RIGHT!  Another plus is the use of the camera and camera angles, in which you know afterwards that every camera shot and every angle it is shot from is thought out completely.  And the movie uses discreet details to give it a very eerie feel.  I can't tell you specific examples of this movie, since saying very little is very likely to give away too much.

","First of all, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a great way to pass a couple of hours with friends.  I just didn't find it, the ending especially, to be the great mystery that many people did.  A friend and I figured out the final plot twist 15 minutes into the movie.  As the action continued, we found a great deal of evidence to support our theory. And at the end, we were proven correct.  In reality, I wish that I had been as surprised as most people were.  It would have made a good movie experience all the more better.  It was rather amusing to look at the faces and hear the conversations of those around us as the movie was letting out. The disbelief and shock that was evident did help compensate for the fact that we weren't equally as surprised.  This is not to take anything away from the performance of Haley Joel Osment.  He's a very gifted young actor, and his portrayal of Cole Sear gave me serious chills.  Toni Collette as his mother was also excellent.  The rest of the actors gave strong, if not spectacular, performances.  All in all, this movie lived up to its reputation as a pleaser, if not all the hype surrounding it."
"Steve-176","Null","0","0","11 October 1999"," Entrancing
","At least three terrific talents have combined to produce The Sixth Sense; a film that captures new cinematic ground, at least in the modern era of film. It occupies something of the same surprising, innovative territory The Usual Suspects challenged a few years ago.<br/><br/>	The Sixth Sense tells the story of an eight year old Philadelphia boy (Haley Joel Osment) who believes he can see dead people. A child psychologist called Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) takes the case hoping that he can help the boy.<br/><br/>	It's a shame that the publicity for the film betrays the boy's secret before we see the film. We aren't told in the film until half way through what is bothering this young fellow. But this would be just about the only criticism I can level at a movie that is a triumph in so many ways, at least for a film from the Hollywood big league.<br/><br/>	And the three talents? Well writer/director N. Night Shyamalan has created an entrancing film which is spooky in the pre-special effects fashion. The Sixth Sense doesn't rely on digital monsters but on much subtler techniques. The half glance, the fleeting shadow and at a push the sudden loud noise are layered upon a cleverly worked script and some very effective, sometimes clever camera technique.<br/><br/>	Shyamalan (pronounced SHA-mah-lahn and I gather called Night by his mates) is a 29 year old American of Indian extraction who has been entranced with film since his early years. He had produced 45 short films by the age of 16! The Sixth Sense is his third feature film following Praying With Anger in which he also starred, and then Wide Awake in 1997. <br/><br/>	The Sixth Sense will definitely catapult Shyamalan into the top category of directors.<br/><br/>	Then for our second on the list there's Haley Joel Osment who in spite of being only 10 years old gives a superb, knowing performance. This is no first flash in the pan effort from Osment. He has been in films and on stage for five years. He was the young Forrest Gump and also played Avery Brown on Murphy Brown. He had a plum role on Ally McBeal for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award.<br/><br/>	The third talent would have to be that superb actor Bruce Willis. He again shows that his talents extend far beyond lunging around gun in hand. He years ago played the lead in Sam Shepard's play Fool For Love which ran for five years off Broadway. <br/><br/>Consider his almost unrecognisable performance in Die For You and his perplexed cop in The Fifth Element before you write Willis off as some idiot action star. Anyway he was great in Die Hard.<br/><br/>	And Australia's Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, Lillian's Story, The Pallbearer) nearly made the list for her touching performance as the young boy's mother.<br/><br/>	The Sixth Sense somehow avoids the mawkishness of the awful Ghost and is miles ahead of The Haunting, the other ghostly film on show now. The essential trick upon which the film is based remained hidden for me, as it will I think for nearly everyone.<br/><br/>	It isn't horrifying but is a bit spooky and thought provoking. It's fine entertainment."

","I believe the Sixth Sense was researched thoroughly as I have heard demonologists speak on the subject of the paranormal: and much of what these clairvoyants had to say was incorporated into the movie.  It was very unsettling indeed.<br/><br/>The acting job by Bruce Willis was probably the best of his career. He is so believable and he's not even hanging from an elevator shaft or racing in a cab through Central Park.  He's just acting, and he's great in this film. As for Osment, well he deserves the Oscar.  If he doesn't get it, then the academy is even more blind than I thought.  (I.E. Shakespeare in Love beating Private Ryan-get bent!)  Quite simply these actors make the characters frighteningly believable.<br/><br/>And that's just for starters.  For the first time in years this was a movie with an actual story.  I know, unreal idea in today's big Hollywood, with their awful big money concepts.  It just proves, give the public a story rather than Godzilla, and they'll go see it.  There's no reliance on special effects made on some turbo-geek's CGI machine to drive the film. Shyamalan has written an amazing script with twists and turns that will leave you with goosebumps for the full two hours.  He also did an incredible job directing the film, with filters, and angles that will make you quite nervous, as if you're with the boy and Willis throughout the terrifying twists.<br/><br/>As for the ending, go see the movie and you will be blown away. It's right up there with The Usual Suspects as far as surprises go.  And bring a warm jacket to the theater because you will have the chills as each plot twist hits you.<br/><br/>Simply put this is by far the best movie I've seen all year. It'll make you ponder the paranormal, even if you don't want to."

","Sixth Sense: What if you could interact with ghosts?

His teachers think he's dysfunctional, his classmates call him a freak and his mother doesn't know what to make of him.   Enter Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), eminent child psychologist (Bruce Willis) who sees Cole as a chance to redeem himself for perceived past failures.   <br/><br/>First let me state that the advertising for this movie is somewhat misleading as this isn't a horror movie in the classic sense.  Given the premise it may sound strange to say that, but the bulk of the movie is spent trying to make us understand Cole's situation rather than trying to scare us every thirty seconds.  That said, there are some very good scares.<br/><br/>Osmont does an excellent job as the troubled Cole, showing maturity beyond his years -  he conveys the terror of his situation without being melodramatic (if only he'd been available for Phantom MenaceÂ…).  Expect to see a lot more of him in the future.  <br/><br/>It was also nice to see Willis given a chance to display his acting talents for a change, rather than just blowing things up (not that I don't enjoy that as well).  Maybe this will finally give Willis some well deserved credibility and more challenging  roles in the future.<br/><br/>Finally, although this movie does not exactly keep up a blistering pace, it had one of the best surprises I've seen since ""No Way Out"".<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","""The Sixth Sense"" doesn't really make ""sense"" to me. After listening to all the hype and seeing the massive money it's raking in, I thought it would be a memorable and effective movie. Well, it didn't really turn out that way for me, I can safely say that it was a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it's fairly good, but it doesn't quite deliver all the goods like it seems to. I think the main thing that keeps this film's quality from declining are it's performances and it's rich sense of poignancy. Terror doesn't seem to strike very largely or often, with the exception of it's eerie atmosphere and one ""jump scene"", frights are practically absent. The child (forgot his name) delivers an excellent performance as the tortured boy who sees dead people, he breathes life into what could of been an annoying, one-dimensional character. I thought Bruce Willis was going to be mediocre, considering that this is his first ""serious"" role, but he was surprisingly convincing as the boy's counsellor. Toni Collette's character was sketchy, but the complicated relationship between her and her son really affected me, it was actually quite moving, especially towards the end. The movie's main flaw is it's sluggish pace and occasionally wooden script, there were some parts that just didn't persuade me, like there was zero power. To be honest, the whole ghost aspect of the film's story was quite weak, it seemed to be more of a backdrop than a plot, but it did quickly get better when it reached the shocking conclusion. All in all, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a good movie in some ways and a fair one in others, overall, it's really the performances that keeps this film worthwhile and interesting."

","Being the ignorant teenager that I am, I needed to have my mother explain the ending to me, as it went too fast for me to grasp just what was happening.  After that, though, it made perfect sense and was a fitting conclusion to a pretty good film.  In my opinion, it really wasn't as jaw-dropping, shocking, and/or haunting as other people say, but that's just my opinion.  I didn't see it coming, but I wasn't looking for it.  I still wasn't shocked, though, because it made sense, etc.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, I thought it was pretty good.  It could very easily have been done as a cheap, gory horror flick, but in the hands of the director (I forgot his name), it actually exhibits a great deal of intelligence and a nice mix of the supernatural and religion.  Yes, Haley Joel Osmont is very good in a role that requires a good deal more maturity than most kids' roles today.  He has many of the frightening moments, and they're all frightening in his hands.  But he also is effective as the frightened little boy who has a very simple desire we all can relate to: not to be called a freak.  Bruce Willis was just okay, but Toni Collette, who plays Osmont's mother, did a good job, as well.  The story as it is presented is very chilling, if not very scary.  There are quite a few frightening bumps along the way, but none that are truly nightmare-inducing. That's probably because this movie is well above the rest of its genre (Maybe not The Blair Witch Project, but I haven't seen that one.) and fits more into the drama area of movies.  Anyway, well-directed, -acted, and -written (except for some stupid parts), and I do recommend it."

It has been a long time since a child has been called to play such a difficult role, and I can't control my dismay that he was not cast as Anakin Skywalker in the newest Star Wars episode.

","This movie is about a young boy's ability to see ghosts, or dead people, walking around like everybody else.  But instead of gruesome scenes with plenty of blood and gore, the film takes a more intelligent, dark, yet riveting path.  It combines elements of several genres, including horror, but also drama and thriller.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on the relationship between child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and Cole (Hayley Joel Osment), the young boy.  Having apparently failed a similar young boy years before, Malcolm is determined to rectify his previous failure, and in doing so, redeem himself.  This is especially so after the boy he failed, now a man, broke into his house, shooting Malcolm before turning the gun on himself.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch, particularly Willis, Osment and Collette (Cole's mother), and on a couple of occasions I was truly scared, having no idea what was going to happen.  Few films today (The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the exception) are able to truly scare an audience, but this certainly is one.<br/><br/>What makes this film really good however, is the twist at the end.  If you haven't watched the film, now is a good time to stop reading, otherwise, keep going.<br/><br/>Anyway, to find out that Malcolm had been dead all along when he was originally shot (and he didn't even know it) was very clever, and during the film you don't have a clue.  But when that realisation comes, it suddenly clicks.  ""Sometimes they don't even know they're dead"", Cole once said. Very apt.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good film that'll make you scared at times, but is very cleverly crafted, and makes you think.  It's nice to see Willis portray a more serious and complex character; certainly a pleasant change."

Every person connected with this production should feel exceptionally proud, especially the director and screenwriter, M. Night Shyamalan, whose talent is the strong common thread weaving all the aforementioned ingredients together.  ""The Sixth Sense,"" in my opinion, is one of the finest films of this decade and is destined to become a classic of its genre.  Mr. Shyamalan has raised the humble ghost story to the level of art, and he has done it in such a way that his film puts many so-called reality-based motion pictures to shame."

","In a time when horror films are steriotypically seen as gratuitous displays of gore and of monsters who repeatedly mutilate ""innocent"" characters for no reason what-so-ever, The Sixth Sense decides to break the mold and return to the ""good old days"" of the horror genre.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't use gore or overused violence to play on the audiance's fear...instead it goes back to way horror films were done in the old days. The days when  Hitchkock was the master of horror.  This movie, beside the ghost who are depicted with their death wounds, is at heart one big mind game.  This movie is very very believable...which adds to the suspense that is already present.  This movie, unlike other horror movies, doesn't treat the audiance as mindless movie goers who are only interested in violence and blood; instead, it treats you as intelligent person and often makes you think about what is going on.  <br/><br/>The acting was superb, the music well done (although at some points it did harken to the current horror style of increase intensity of music means something is about to happen), an excelent story, and of course the best ending ever to be shone on the silver screen.  The ending comes at you out of nowhere and you find yourself with your mouth dropping to the floor.<br/><br/>
If you see the movie don't tell anyone who hasn't see it how the movie ends. Trust me.   Hitchkock had the right idea about telling people not to tell others about the ending of Psycho but when people started to tell others...the ""magic"" so to speak died from the film."

I left the theater stunned, and I don't know how anyone could find this movie boring. Apparently some people need mile-a-minute comedy or nothing...<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is pretty darn good, but he's wallpaper compared to the powerful performance of Haley Joel Osment. Osment should have top billing, not to mention an Oscar for Best Actor. As a young person, I think it's about time a kid gets the recognition they deserve by being cast in a real role. And it's always good when a movie recognizes the supernatural as a very real part of life. So my admiration to the Sixth Sense for really delivering what a lot of movies are afraid to."
"pmac-2","Null","0","0","2 October 1999"," A film that manages to transcend the sum of its parts.
","""The Sixth Sense"" has at least three flawed areas that interfered with my enjoyment of what could have been a real gripper.  Number one (and I am not being humorous)was the silly and so very obvious hair piece perched atop Bruce Willis's bald cranium. At first I found it quite distracting, with my focus continuously wandering up to that area.  I was mostly able to work through this as the film progressed, but was never able to completely avoid its niggling presence. Secondly, the bizarre and phantasmagoric plot required just a little too much suspension of what is left of my intellect to be entirely persuasive in a film so deadly serious in its portent.  I also found the effects makeup of the dead people very unconvincing and rather poorly done. Finally, Bruce Willis is, in my opinion, not a very good actor. Competent, yes, particularly when involved in one of his action/adventure vehicles where charisma and presence are required more than acting excellence.  I do realize, however, that the constraints of the script and the grim mood of this film did require a rather somber and wooden approach to the portrayal of his character. Happily, all of this is forgotten with the superb performance of young master Osment playing the part of the boy, Cole, along with an excellent and convincing job by Toni Collette as his mother.  The very last scenes of the movie were obviously designed to shamelessly extract all possible moisture from one's tear ducts, including mine, but upon leaving the theater, I was able to apply my most useful and stringent criterion for judging a film: how long did it stay with me?  An hour, 5 hours, the next day?  All of the above. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a very good film which manages to transcend the goofiness of the plot by means of good direction, fine camera work and some excellent and intense acting--and, of course, the surprises at the end."

Anyway, the plot was really cool and the script was good. The acting was great. Bruce Willis was great as usual. Haley Joel Osment was a surprise.

The ending isn't quite as shocking as it's been made out to be but does lift the film up to make it pretty creative.  Willis, Osment, Collette, Williams and an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg all turn in fine performances.  Even though it's not scary, the Sixth Sense contains enough suspense for a few shocks and is safe enough for an entire family to watch.  For a change, a movie that does live up to the hype."

","Okay.  I have to give the film the fact that the main actors in Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment give great performances. And the first time I saw the movie, I liked it a lot.  However, upon second viewing, I have to say that it bored me.  The movie creeps along slowly, there is not much of a plot, and the scares are not really effective but just to make the viewer jump. Of course the ending loses a lot of its impact on the viewer, so that lowered my opinion a lot.  It is a well-crafted movie, but the film drags way too much.  The ending should not influence the opinions of people about the movie as a whole, which does not contain much substance."
"Tabby-6","Null","0","0","29 September 1999"," Quite possibly the best horror film in years
","No doubt about it, ""The Sixth Sense"" is the best horror movie I've seen since the original ""Poltergeist."" The plot is deceptively simple -- a kid who sees ghosts -- but the movie goes so much deeper than that. It's an allegory for all our nameless fears that we have to fight alone because nobody else shares them.<br/><br/>Besides the plot, multiple other elements come into play in making ""The Sixth Sense"" the sensation that it is. The acting is superb on all ends. Haley Joel Osment plays Cole with an impressively haunted maturity, and Bruce Willis stays out of his way. And for such relatively small parts, the ghosts give off near-visible auras of otherworldly anger and fear.<br/><br/>The other main element in the psychological terror behind the movie is how it attempts to instill fear in the audience. Transcending flashing lights and computer-generated wraiths, ""The Sixth Sense"" goes instead for suggestions of cold and some sharp makeup effects. And not to be forgotten is the score, which chilled me deeper than most of the visual elements.<br/><br/>One thing that everyone wants to talk about is the ending. While I won't reveal it here, suffice it to say that I had made dozens of guesses about what the surprise twist could be, and I could not have been more wrong. It completely knocked me off my feet. In short, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a must-see for anyone who likes a well-thought-out thriller. If it doesn't leave you stricken, impressed, and a little scared the next time you're alone in the dark, you may already have crossed over."

I can't understand why this movie gets compared with Blair Witch all the time. For one, I wouldn't classify it as horror.  What it really is is a supernatural thriller that touches upon drama and endearing comic moments, all-the-while employing all that is wonderful and good about film making to create a touching and memorable movie, whereas Blair Witch is nothing than an over-rated novelty.<br/><br/>The filming, the acting, the script - everything is virtually flawless here. While it does have a startling plot twist, the strong story and well-developed characters prevent this from becoming just another gimmick-flick.  And Haley isn't just good for a little boy - he's just plain GOOD.  You don't often find that much charisma in someone so young.  To me, this movie is the perfect blend of art an entertainment.  It's also another one of the few films to actually make me cry - three times no less.<br/><br/>We can only hope that Bruce Willis will keep up the good work.  I have my fingers crossed."

His depression is threatening his relationship with his wife, but he sees in Cole a chance for redemption.<br/><br/> But Cole's problem may not be psychological.  The boy claims to be plagued by visions of the dead...<br/><br/> So Bruce strips down to his vest, takes out an Uzi, and BLOWS THOSE GHOSTS AWAY!!!!!    <br/><br/> Actually, I made that up, because this isn't your typical Bruce film, but it is a very good one.<br/><br/> Bruce does very well in it, as the shrink tormented by ghosts of his own. His performance is reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo and the film as a whole has a similar dreamlike feel to it.  The film covers similar ground thematically too - the corruption of the past by the present, the hold the dead have on the living.  Both Bruce and the boy are in the grip of the past and this is evoked by haunting images of Philadelphia hanging malevolently over them both.<br/><br/> The other performances are very fine too.  The young boy conveys his terror and incomprehension very well and Toni Collette (""You're TERRIBLE Muriel!"") is convincing as the fraught mother, trying to save her son from something she can't even comprehend.<br/><br/> The film has a washed-out, dead look to it, similar to The Exorcist and the film probes similar anxieties (the mother's impotence to protect her child from abuse).  But this is a much more compassionate film than The Exorcist and stays away from in-your-face horror, inducing instead a low-key feeling of tension and unease.<br/><br/> It's beautifully shot, well acted, cleverly written and rather creepy.<br/><br/> I think it must be a good film, because it's made me come over all pretentious.<br/><br/>

People don't seem to like anything that is going to make them think because their minds are so vacuous that they sit there in the theater and wait for it to be filled by Hollywood drivel. This movie is certainly worht the price of admission and more."

","I have nothing but praise for this incredible smashing psychological thriller with a stunning performance by Haley Joel Osment, a revelatory acting turn by Toni Collete (far from the musings of Muriel's Wedding), and a subtle, subdued performance by Bruce Willis. <br/><br/>Yes...the final twist is jaw-dropping and I absolutely did not see it coming. And I don't know about other viewers but I was absolutely scared out of mind; I found it very clever that M. Night Shyamalan managed to work the physical sensations of being scared (cold skin, raised hairs, goose bumps) into the script, i.e. that's how you know the ghosts are around you.<br/><br/>
But many readers keep referring to this as a Bruce Willis movie (""It's different for him"", ""I expected it to be another Bruce film""), but it's not. In fact, replace Willis with another unknown actor and what you get is...AN INDEPENDENT FILM. This is not a big studio thriller (a la the Haunting); it is very much an independent film in its careful plotting, its pacing, and its ambitious ideas. I love that this film has captured America's attention as it is a reason why independent film and independent filmmakers are forces to reckon with and pay attention to. <br/><br/>My hat is off to M. Night Shyamalan for giving us a scary, highly emotional, involving and unforgettable film. I for one would like to see Mr. Shyamalan's other works, all of which are...gasp! Independent films."

DO NOT let anyone give away too many details and ruin the movie for you. But let me just say you'll think about it for days...<br/><br/>Fans of cheap horror flicks expecting a grisly, gruesome scare-fest will no doubt be disappointed. But those who enjoy a good psychological thriller with an unusual abundance of intelligent dialogue will be glad they saw it. This movie is really mischaracterized as a horror film, which in my book is a major disservice. No hackers, slashers or cheap camera tricks here. It's a well-acted, well-written and well-directed suspense drama that really delivers.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Bruce Willis since his ""Moonlighting"" days. Even the most cynical critics who pigeon-hole him as just another action star will be forced to sit up and take notice of his acting in this one. And the little boy puts in a truly poignant and subtle performance for his young age. Handled by a less-adept child actor, his character easily could have been played way over the top and the movie would have been ruined.<br/><br/>For those of you who are hesitant to see ""The Sixth Sense"" because it's marketed as a horror movie, don't let that stop you.

This, plus the music and cinematography are outstanding but that is not what really made it with me.<br/><br/>I never see junky horror films and that is what I thought this was until some of my metaphysical friends clued me in that it was a great movie. Metaphysics is the belief in things unseen including the entire premise of this movie.<br/><br/>I am a licensed practitioner of metaphysics and this absolutely beautiful movie is a primer on beliefs held by many in the metaphysical community, which not coincidentally is centered in California, with Arizona and Florida following.<br/><br/>The entire movie is a wonderful example of how the Creator ultimately weaves everything together in the right and perfect fashion.  Every piece fits like a glove in the tapestry of eternal, unending life.<br/><br/>If you liked Powder, Phenomenon, Defending Your Life, Ghost, or any of a host of films like that, don't miss this one!<br/><br/>While it sure is not ""horror"", Sixth Sense could be described by many as ""fantasy"".  For me, it is a picture of a very real possibility. The underlying concept of people floating around trying to work out unresolved issues before ""moving on"" may be scary to some and probably way beyond the realm of possibility for most. In any case, this movie does a superb job of painting a tapestry that most metaphysicians would quickly recognize and love."

","""The Sixth Sense"" was a sharp, haunting thriller that was almost painful to watch.  The main thing that distracted me from this movie was a constant feeling of pity for the main character in the story, a little boy.  Not only was the kid living in constant terror, but nobody believed him, and it looked like he would be locked up in a mental ward.  Focusing on the constant pain the boy was in was to me a major distraction, causing me to lose track of a lot of subtle details I otherwise would have noticed.  I didn't find the movie terribly entertaining.  However, like most others, I was *COMPLETELY* blindsided by the surprise ending - I didn't see it coming at all, and when it comes it's a real shock.  The audience in the theater I saw the movie in let out a loud, collective gasp of exhaustion and fascination when the end credits started to roll, as if they had been holding their breath for two hours.

Since that type of thing hasn't really been what you could call ""overused,"" I'm okay with it.  What I'm NOT okay with, though, is this movie scoring higher than Usual Suspects, because on originality alone it did not.  Think about it, would you have given the movie such a high rating if it had ended differently?  And you can only give so much credit to an idea that so obviously has been recycled.  But enough diatribe on that.  Beyond that, the movies bear hardly any resemblance to each other.  ""Sixth Sense"" is much more of an emotionally touching film (""Usual Suspects"" neither is nor tries to be emotional).  And in spite of my bitterness, I did like the movie a whole lot.  A WHOLE lot more than I expected to--the preview made it look even worse than Bruce's last ""child-helping"" film (something about a computer virus, right?)  I don't think Bruce has been this good with a kid since ""North.""  Anyway, the kid completely shone.  I can't wait to see more of him in the future, he's amazing.  And.. back to the summary line...

I do have to respond to the many comments that have pointed out that the setup is slow.(As one comment stated.. ""The beginning was ONLY character development."")<br/><br/>I personally am of the opinion that they made a mistake in the marketing of the film.  I don't believe that Cole's ""gift"" should have been publicized. The film would have been much better if it hadn't been, but to be fair, it would have been difficult to sell it any other way.<br/><br/>If we lived in a perfect world and Access Hollywood, Entertainment Tonight and E! didn't exist, imagine how bizarre this film would have been, with the viewer not exactly knowing what was going on until Cole's confession.  <br/><br/>So to those with their holier-than-thou critiques of this film, saying that it doesn't try to go beyond the typical boundaries of Hollywood filmmaking, I say that you're wrong.  This is a psychological drama that is also a horror film, not the other way around.  There are very few films that can even claim to do the same.  What lessened the impact of this film WAS Hollywood with its (unfortunately necessary) marketing.<br/><br/>Don't expect a masterpiece, but definitely understand that this movie is a cut far above the typical schlock of the horror genre."

",". . . and Haley Joel Osment is a wonder. If both of these actors are not nominated for Academy Awards (and BOTH in the Best Actor category) then Hollywood is indeed a screwed up town. Willis' portrayal as the tormented child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is sensitive and compassionate, a beautifully realized, complete performance. And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has ""the sixth sense"" is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in ""The Miracle Worker"". The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save. I've seen the film twice now--blown away by it the first time, enjoying how well-crafted it is on the second round. The evil-spirited side of me was also looking for some hole, SOMEWHERE, in the film when I saw it again, but if a hole exists, I can't find it.

There was even some humor, although it did little to ease the tension.<br/><br/>Kudos to the actors in the film... I have to admit, I'd never considered Bruce Willis much of a dramatist before I saw this one.

One performance that I'm sure will be overlooked is Cole's mother, played by Toni Collette.  I was very impressed by the realism she gave her role.<br/><br/>The only thing that I didn't understand about the movie was the ""surprise"" ending.

","This is a reasonably well written, well shoot and constructed film with no substance to mention, playing it safe and not daring to transgress the conventional Hollywood frames. Young Haley Joel Osman is the carrying force of this film and succeeds  in receiving lots of empathy for his unhappy, fearful condition. Many scenes of this film are touching, and some scenes startling and slightly disturbing, but for the most part this film has been dumbed down to achieve maximum audience and profit. The good craftmanship of the film makers is being wasted in the director's lack of strength in his vision and edge. This is such a neat package of ""horror"" for cinematically uneducated and undemanding from a nice, compromising Spielberg school of directing. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis is not playing a moronic action-hero, but an introverted academic in his typical boring way. Comparing this film to ""Exorcist"", ""Shining"" or ""Silence Of The Lambs"" would constitute a blasphemy towards great masters of film making like William Friedkin, Stanley Kubrick and Jonathan Demme. <br/><br/>This film is more of the calibre of ""Flatliners"" than aforementioned achievements.

","The movie ""The Sixth Sense"" was a very good and scary movie. The criteria for a movie like this one is that it has to be scary, full of surprises, have a good plot, make sense, and have a good ending. This movie had it all!<br/><br/>The main thing that made this movie especially scary was the ghosts- not just one or two, but a whole army of zombie-like ghouls who haunt the gothic streets of modern Philadelphia. The ghosts follow this boy named Cole, because they seem to want something from him. The thing that makes that scary is that you as the viewer or him as the person don't know what they want from him until the end. It is very suspenseful. The other thing that makes this movie scary was that you didnt know if Cole was crazy because he was the only one who could seem them. But then you find out that he's not crazy, and that all the ghosts are really there to him, and that they need his help.<br/><br/>I think that the movie was good because of the fabulous ending. The ending really got you thinking. Not just about  how it ended, but the whole movie. It just made you reflect back and go through the movie to see if the ending matched up to the movie. Another thing that made the ending really good was that it was very scary. <br/><br/>The movie was extremely good and scary, The whole movie was made very well, and it was obvious it had a lot of time and effort put into it.

","Movies, movies, movies they can be so happy, sad, and exciting. Yes there are scary movies , and yes there are disgustiing movies that make you want to leave but they can be so intresting to go and see. Sixth sense is a great movie to go and see. I basically liked Sixth Sense because of its weird wacky ending. Sith sense was a movie that you might have to go and see twice if you are slow like me but you  didnt mind seeing it twice at all. I think this movie is highly recommended and I suggest that you go and see it but you should make sure that you bring a friend with you. One reason because your going to need someone to grab there hand for the scary parts then you might want that friend with you for asking questions at the end of the movie. SRVHS Debbie"

","A good movie is well through out beginning to end.  A good movie keeps you hooked eyes glued to the screen hands gripping the armrests and feet plastered to the ground.  A good movie sets you up throught the whole thing then surprises you with a shocking mind boggling ending.  The sixth sense delivered all this and more The key to a truely intriguing movie is in the acting.  Bruise Willis gave a wonderful performance as usual but Haley was shockingly better probably the best child actors I've ever seen.  When Cole (Haley) gets locked in the attic by two of his schoolmates and was beat up by the ghost you could feel his pain it was almost real.  Cole helping us find out how the young girl really died.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie you wondered about Malcome's relationship with his wife, for example when she sat waiting for him at a restraunt on their anniversary when he finally showed up and tried to pay the bill but she took it from him ( that was harsh).  Scenes like that keep the movie going and hinted around a future occurrence.  but it was the part when the little boy told his mother that grandma said hi and that she did go to her daughters dance recitle years ago when they had gotten in a fight.  That was when you knew the mother believed him. In my opinion this movie The Sixth sense is very good worth every penny and more.  Its powerful cast and plot came to gether to make a good movie that you and your family can see.  It will keep you talking about its ending for days.  This movie definitely gets four stars and two thumbs up from me!!"
"SRVHS","Null","0","0","17 September 1999"," The spectator says...Best Movie EVER!!!
","This summer I went and saw the awesome movie the Sixth Sense! It had an awesome plot,great casting and acting!! This movie was very easy to follow with many twists,turns and cool make-up. This movie kept me glued to my seat!<br/><br/>
Some of the best scene that showed the most amazing acting was when the little boy woke up in the middle of the night and wandered into the kitchen only to find a dead woman looking for something in the cupboards.When she started to talk to him  the poor boy got frightened(as would most any one)and ran back to his little red tent and began to shiver and cry. This scene was amazing because of the great make-up.The little boy acted like he had really seen a ghost! Another time that the little boy showed great acting was when he first told Bruce Willis about his terrifying secret. This was an amazing scene because he cried like he really could see ghosts.<br/><br/>
When you see some really good make-up it makes the movie much better and more life like. When you see this awesome make-up is when one of the dead people talks to the little boy and then turns around you see a bloody head. The had been shot off by accidental gun fire. This make-up made the movie more life like and seem like the ghosts were actually there. The best scene though, is when the boy is talking to a woman she moves so you can see the other side of her face to realize that she is actually dead. The one side had been burned to a very crispy person. This was the best make-up I have ever seen in this kind of horror flick.<br/><br/>
In conclusion I think that this is a must see movie, not only for the theaters but a good one for keeps!This summer I have also seen the Haunting of the hill house and that movie was lame compared to  this brilliant move. This year if you see a movie see  THE SIXTH SENSE!!<br/><br/>

"SRVHS","Null","0","0","17 September 1999"," Kellie says The Sixth Sense is best movie of the summer!
","The Sixth Sense was an awesome movie, and by far the best of the summer. It had all key elements that make for a great movie. It was creative, original, and above all completely terrifying. A part in the movie that got to me most was when Haley Joel Osmit says, ""Ya know those prickly hairs on the back of your neck? That's them."" He's referring to the ghosts and what makes it more scary is that we have never had any explanation for hairs standing on end; except for the fact that we are cold. The movies uses that and says that when ghosts are around the temperature drops, making us cold, and giving us goose bumps. In fact, almost anything pulled from the movie could and would be considered both scary and creative. <br/><br/>The movie was undoubtedly scary. It was the type that made the whole theater scream with terror and gasp at anything interesting. It captivated the audience. But what made it do that was it's unpredictable horror. In most horrors you only see dead people at night; whether they're just being killed or rising from the dead. In this movie dead people show up in broad daylight. Also, you see the dead after whatever it was that killed them. In one case, you see a little boy that was shot in the head. The suspense is endless and the surprises are non-stop. One thing can be said about it, it will make you grasp your neighbors arm as your mouth drops wide open.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense made for a great summer movie because it had creativity and originality. The Sixth Sense defies all rules for your average horror film. First off, most horrors have a killer that pops out and scares the audience. The Sixth Sense does not have a murderer and is still tens times scarier than any thriller. You never seem to know when another dead person will show up. Some can even come in a matter of seconds and we don't even see them. Also, the shocking end to the perfect movie. The end alone would have been enough creativity and originality for the whole movie. (Don't worry, I won't spoil the ending, even though it was wonderful, but I called it!) The ending and plot alone show how The Sixth Sense doesn't follow the guidelines set for thrillers and goes off to explore uncharted territory, that turned out to be a gold mine!<br/><br/>Kellie, a San Ramon High School student"
"SRVHS","Null","0","0","17 September 1999"," Megan thinks it is a scary, disturbing drama!
","This summer I saw the movie The Sixth Sense. It was a scary, disturbing drama. the movie was a sure fire Oscar award. The criteria for that kind of a movie should be good acting and a great ending. Bruce Willis starred and played a psychiatrist and Haley Joel Osmet played a little boy who can see dead people.<br/><br/>I thought this movie had excellent acting. Both actors should be nominated for an award of some sort. Willis, for example, was in a scene where he was listening to a recorded conversation. He had to find out if there was some one else in the room that he didn't see. He acted some what scared, surprised and deep in thought,        when he faintly heard the other voice. I thought it was good acting because he had to portray so many feelings at the same time. Another scene where great acting skills came in, was when the Osmet was running into his tent to hide from a dead person. They showed him sitting in the corner of the tent crying with the most terrified look on his face. From the look on his face it made you feel as terrified as he was. These two examples show the fine skills of the actors.<br/><br/>
The Sixth Sense had absolutely the best ending any movie has ever had. It made the entire movie theater full of people say, "" Oh, my gosh!"" I won't give away the ending so as not to spoil a great surprise. This ending made you go back and rethink the whole movie. It was a story that made sense because of the ending. I really liked this ending because it wasn't 100 percent happy, as so many movies are. It left you thinking about the movie the entire night long. The ending of this movie was full of different emotions: it was scary, it was smart, it was sad, it was happy, it was unusual.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who likes superior acting and a movie that makes you think twice, along with a magnificent ending. These two criteria make up a disturbing drama. In a summer full of supposedly scary slasher teen movies, The Sixth Sense is a rare combination of variety of emotions in a well- acted, smart plot movie. BY: MEGAN - Student at San Ramon High"

","Let me tell you something. This summer am I glad I got out to the movie theaters and saw The Sixth Sense. This action-packed thriller certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. The suspense is incredible and the dead people popping up where ever will definately give you the chills. Bruce Willis and the child actor who played the 10 year old boy do a wonderful job in this picture trying to scare you half to death and be pleading for more. Like I said before, the suspense is incredible. Like when the girl who gets poisened haunt the 10 year old boy, you're dying to get to the bottom of the story. Even if the horror isn't scary enough or the blood isn't gory enough, the suspense will keep you in the theater until the credits. Before I go any further, let me just say that the child actor does the best child acting I have ever seen. His cleaver imagination makes you believe that he really can see dead people. For example, when he is playing a little mind game with Bruce Willis, he looks up and down at the end making it seem like there is someone there standing next to him. But just the way everything fits together, it's like a puzzle. The kid is simply just amazing. Therefore I conclude that The Sixth Sense was certainly a well put together film that will wow you. The suspense will keep you hanging on until the end. Not to mention the acting. By, Sarah, San Ramon High School"

","""The Sixth Sense"" is about a troubled youngster who communicates with the dead and the relationship he develops with his psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment gives an unforgettable performance as the haunted child. Bruce Willis plays the sympathetic psychiatrist who tries to help the boy deal with his ""gift"". The mood of the film is set from the opening scene in which we see a red light bulb turned on and a woman enter a cold wine cellar. The nuanced scenes that follow lead to an unforgettable ending that requires a second viewing of the film. The writing is suspenseful and tight. True, it does start off a bit slow, but upon my second viewing, I realized this is part of the film's mood. ""The Sixth Sense"" is probably one of the best psychological thrillers that I've seen in a long time and brings to mind one of my favorite (and I think one of the best)psychological thrillers of the '70's - ""Audrey Rose"". (Although that film deals with reincarnation, I think the mood is somewhat similar.)"
"Rebecca4-2","6","0","0","15 September 1999"," Effectively scary but overrated film.
","While I admit that the suspense scenes had me covering my eyes, I was disappointed with this movie as a whole. The script was corny and overwrought and other than Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette (the actors portraying the little boy and his mother) I felt the acting was stilted and uncompelling. This movie has uneven, and, at times, frustratingly slow pacing. Some of the plot points are ridiculously pat (and obvious) and I didn't find the ending to be terribly surprising (or satisfying). There are other films with similar last-minute twists that are much more effective... see Jacob's Ladder, The Seventh Sign, and the one that I think inspired them all, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" based on the Ambrose Bierce story. I can only guess that the popularity of this movie is due to the performance of Osment, who is really excellent--he is the highlight of this overrated film."

I must say that your hair may stand on end (especially the ones on the back of your neck), and for some scenes I almost jumped out of my seat. But I have to say that although the child does ""see dead people"" (as quoted in the trailers and tv spots) it isn't like some kind of zombie movie. Dead people aren't moving about with that tacky moaning and grunting that I had at first suspected. The casting, direction and plot are superb.

","Having seen Blair Witch last weekend and now Sixth Sense, I tell you, I will have problems sleeping for the next week or two.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is a wonderfully crafted and executed tale about a young boy (Cole) who has (surprise!) a sixth sense: he can see and talk to the dead as if they were right there with the living.  A neat twist of a psychic nature, no?  The boy finds that he himself has a mission of sorts after dealing with horrific visions of the dead.  I won't divulge anything about the mission.<br/><br/>Willis' character, whose name eludes me at the moment, also finds that he has a mission.  His wife is growing distant, and it's up to him to get refocused on his wife instead of his career.  I mean, having someone attack you probably would provoke you into correcting a career-based mistake, don't you think?<br/><br/>The ending is 100% pure shocking and I will say that it was excellent.<br/><br/>But as a side note, lots of people are quick to compare this to Blair Witch. I've got to say that to do that is, to me, quite silly.  Blair Witch works on a VERY different level than The Sixth Sense.  This particular film is a tad slow, but patience is a virtue.

Don't read any spoilers, or you might as well forget about seeing the movie. As for the acting, Haley Joel Osment was EXCELLENT. He is the greatest child actor I have ever known. He plays his character with true emotional depth. No big-eyed, teary 'Mommy I'm scaaaared' performance that I'm accustomed to seeing in most horror movies but a real performance. You can actually FEEL his fear and you can really sympathize with him. The scenes with him and his mother are very touching. No, this is more than just a horror flick. One of the scenes that I can't forget is when Osment looks steadfastly away from the dead bodies hanging from a beam at his school. He doesn't scream or anything, but that scene carries weight, it tells you that the boy has seen this type of things many times. Another one is when he tells Willis at the hospital that he sees dead people around him, who don't know they're dead, and they see only what they want to see. Creepy. Osment deserves an Oscar for his role. Oh and Willis was good too, the two characters interact wonderfully."

","What a complete waste of time and money.<br/><br/>1.  They used your typical formula of scare tactics to make the audience jump (let it get dark, make the music scary and then have something unidentifiable jump across the screen).  You really have no choice but to react, your body can't stop it, but this has been called ""scary"".  And it didn't even happen that often in the movie.<br/><br/>2.  The movie dragged in too many spots for me to even start describing them.  I kept saying to myself (get on with it, etc...)<br/><br/>3.  They made the movie confusing only to give the appearance of a ""surprise ending"".  True I didn't realize their real ending...<br/><br/>4. Wow! The camera work.  I have heard of poor filmmaking but this is unreal.  I keep hearing people who don't like the Blair Witch Project because of the unstable camera (most of those people don't realize its neccesity) but this movie was made in the third person using a lot of money and I was still having flashbacks of the BWP.  This movie was supposed to have stable shots but I kept getting annoyed when the camera would struggle like a homevideo.<br/><br/>5.  They never developed any character.  Especially the boy.  I wanted to know more about his relationships with the ghosts.  What did they want, why were they there?  But they never tell you.<br/><br/>Therefore if you are so inclined to watch your typical wonderbread ""horror"" film (that isn't even as good as Friday the 13th part 8 go ahead and pay the 6-9 dollars to see it.  I can promise that you will jump three times and be completely confused until the end.

Bruce Willis does some fine work as the psychiatrist who must try to help this boy beleaguered by ghosts. I wonder, however, about some scenes that must have ended up on the cutting room floor. We never get any explanation about the ghosts in Cole's own home. Their unsettling appearances are never explained. And I am sorry, but I did foresee the ending.

Sure, Bruce Willis is given top-billing in all of the film's promotional efforts, but there is no doubt who the ""star"" of this creepy and affecting film is. Osment is remarkable in the role of an elementary-aged boy with ""The Sixth Sense"".

Excellent cinematography by Fujimoto (Silence of the Lambs) whose contrasting light and colors in various scenes set the stage for the eerie settings.  The camera work by the director, Shyamalan, is very deliberate and captivating.  He moves it slowly throughout the suspense scenes--capturing every little detail and crack in the wall, so we can feel that we have a part in the movie.

Bruce Willis gives his best performance of his career.  In my opinion, he's quite worthy of an Oscar nomination, but he'll never get one.  He'll be lucky if he gets a Golden Globe nomination.  The real treasure of the film is Haley Joel Osment.  He gives the greatest child performance I have ever seen.  It would be a travesty if he doesn't win Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards next year.  Osment's performance makes me, as a theatre-acting major at University Of Illinois, feel envious of him, which I feel is a pathetic emotion.  The writing and direction is flawless.  The pacing is slow, but slow for a reason.  We get a real sense of the characters and the situation and it makes us care about every one of them and their outcome.  The ending, as many have said, is shocking and very effective.  Nothing can prepare you for it; it's the best climax since, should I say, ""The Usual Suspects."" The ending makes you look at the film in an entirely different prospective and that is one of the film's greatest achievements.

It has everything: intelligence, a few pretty creepy moments, and some of the best acting I've ever seen...coming from the very young and VERY talented Haley Joel Osment who outacts nearly every actor I've ever seen.

","I decided to see the movie after reading JimB-4's comments, but the only thing I agree with was the strong performance of the young boy.  Scary?? Hardly.  Intelligent?  Where?  Twist Ending? What twist ending? I figured it out halfway through.  Very disappointing. I really looked forward to a compelling movie, but it was painfully slow, boring and not exciting at all. And why so many lingering close-ups of Bruce Willis? I even began getting tired of the close-ups of the boy, too. I am amazed that it has received such a high vote on the imdb. A real waste of time."

","I'd put off going to see the ""Sixth Sense"" because people kept saying it was creepy and after seeing it, I might be afraid to be in the house alone or won't be able to sleep at night.  But I decided to ignore their comments and went to see it.  I'm glad I did. The movie just wasn't about a boy (Haley Joel Osment) who sees ""dead people"".  It was also about family; his relationship with his mother, and about single parenting.  I thought Haley and Bruce Willis acted well together (they clicked well).  I think Bruce's character was kind of laid back. But maybe that was on purpose; Bruce allowed the very talented Haley Joel Osment to take center stage. I've seen Haley in other projects and he always seems to stand out. I think Haley was the star of this movie. The actress who played his mother was also great as the divorced mom.  I really loved that scene in the car between mother and son.  Brought tears to my eyes.  When I got home, I replayed all the scenes in my head and told myself that I wouldn't mind seeing it again (before it comes on cable or on video).  And oh, what a great, and creative ending. If you haven't seen it yet, GET TO IT.  You'll love it.  Two thumbs up for this great movie!"

Sixth Sense follows a child psychologist on a journey into the mind of a little boy who is labeled with paranoid schitzophrenic.  Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crow, a doctor who was recently awarded a citation for his work.  It is after a frightening encounter with a patient from his past that Crow meets Cole, a paranoid little boy in desperate need of a chewable prozac.  M Night Shyamalan directs this brilliant film, slowly unraveling a secret that this boy is too frightened to face, and too unwilling to confess.  We soon learn that this child can see ghosts, and Malcolm Crow might be the only person that can help him through his frightening ordeal. <br/><br/>
Haley Joel Osment, who plays the role of Cole, is so brilliant that I predict he will be nominated (and perhaps should win) an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) does an admirable job playing the mother who can't understand what is happening to her son. <br/><br/>
Yes, this film has a shocking ending (brilliant, in fact) and don't dare let anyone ruin it for you.  Go see this once to be scared, and again to let it sink in."

","Everything a good movie should be.  A great story, a superb cast, and not over-hyped (ala Blair Witch Project).  Bruce Willis plays a rather sub-dued role as a renowned child-psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment plays the chilling Cole Sear.  They have the best on-screen chemistry I have ever seen.  Cole is given a lot of scenes where he has to react well or the scene is blown.  He does it so well, in fact, that it sounds more like a normal conversation than a script.  I will admit that it starts out slow, and it did get boring.  But no matter what you do, PAY ATTENTION.  It will pay off in the greatest ending ever shot on film.  This is one of the most highly enjoyable films ever made and I think that everyone should be given the opportunity to experience it"

"CineMmon","9","0","0","31 August 1999"," Write with your gut - Direct with your heart
","The Sixth Sense is about passion and restlessness, about the unseen world. From the outset the story tears at the inside of your mind and seeks a comfortable place to hide, a warm understanding place to call home. This movie slowly creates its premise from the veil that shrouds the spirit world and pulls you into a place that is both familiar and uneasy. This is the small noise in the night not the loud shrieking of banshees. With out a doubt  M. Night Shyamalan has written and directed a brilliant look at the spirit world, his command of character and plot and the compelling use of camera and editing reminds one of Hitchcock or a more mature contemporary director like Altman in the Gingerbread Man. <br/><br/>Though much of the focus has rightly been on the child actor Haley Joel Osment and tough guy Bruce Willis' re-birth as a charming and complex vehicle, the cohesion and mounting tension of the film owe much to the well thought out work of Shyamalan. Starting with the development of a wonderful chemistry between the actors and their slow developed interaction with each other the writer-director M. Night Shyamalan weaves a work that somehow keeps you both pressed back into and at the same time on the edge of your seat. He is the face that we see in the firelight for he tells stories in much the same way that other master storytellers do  slowly building up each piece of his fantasy world. It clearly is Shyamalan that continually surprises us with small feints and intricate maneuvers, for me it was his work that was a pleasure to watch. On the other hand  the inspired Osment / Willis pairing is also a treat - reasoned, well paced and seasoned with the just the right about of well spoken lines and haunting  haunted looks. The other cast members major and minor also help to round out a believable story. This was a true example of movie as a team sport!<br/><br/>Shyamalan is a talent that knows what buttons to push, this is not someone who feels he has to shock us every minute to scare us or preach to us every minute to open us up to new ways of thinking. He slowly reveals to us our uneasiness with things in the natural world - like houses that creak in the night. What a complete story, what a deep imagination. This is a story of restless passion that takes hold of you and won't let you go.  Even after you return home something will gnaw at you. We'll leave the light on for you - Ya hear!<br/><br/>See this film in a theater with an ample screen and good sound system."

Bruce Willis is great as a child psychologist. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent acting job he made the character of Cole quite convincing. Like the Blair Witch Project this movie doesn't use tons of gore scenes instead it takes time to develop a strong story.

","Even apart from its ""surprise"" (just to brag, I wasn't fooled) -it's still a good little thriller- very aware of its (structural) limitations and mostly content to be what it is.  Studio films are rarely this efficient or focused.  And Osment is terrific, though it annoyed me to realize that, even without direction, he would have made a much, much better Anakin Skywalker (he was even the right age!!).<br/><br/>The smaller moments, though, are what make the movie worthwhile for me- the school play (light years from any of the like scenes in the abysmal ""Simon Birch"", for example), the couple in the jewelry store, the events at the wake.  Shyamalan does a good job of showing people relate in _pictures_ (true, a necessity afforded by the plot); it's so much easier, but not nearly so powerful, to let words do all the work. Great decision to shoot in old Philadelphia, too. <br/><br/>(Side note: ""Wide Awake"" was also a religious-themed film, albeit in a much different way, and I've read that as a child Shyamalan attended a Catholic school at his parents insistence, even though they were/are practicing Hindus.  As his career takes shape, I'll be curious to see how his background is reflected in his films.)<br/><br/>It strikes me that the film has benefitted from its relative lack of publicity- one actually had to go looking for information to find out anything.  The less you know, the more the movie'll hit you.  This is a rare instance in which the studio's inability to recognize what they had actually increased the film's impact, not to mention its box-office receipts.<br/><br/>That said, it's really just an overlong episode of ""The X-Files"" with the 'heart' of ""Touched By An Angel""; theologically dubious and ultimately sentimental.  Is it any surprise that it's become such a success?"

","In the opening sequence, a child psychiatrist (Bruce Willis) is shot in the guts by an adult patient, a raving loony, who has broken into his home. In the scenes that follow, set a year later, the shrink meets up with a small boy who claims to see and hear the dead--imperceptible to everyone else around him. Since the shrink is never spoken to by anyone else in the movie, and the kid is the ""only one who hears voices,"" the Stunning Surprise Ending that's promised is about as stunning and surprising as the end of a Polish joke. It's an indescribable experience to sit in an auditorium full of people who are held rapt by this brainingly obvious hooey. The writer-director, M. Night Shmyahan, has studied THE EXORCIST and THE SHINING, and, considering those films clearly too violent for this genteel moment in moviemaking, has taken one element from them--numbing, lugubrious slowness. He has made one commercially sound choice: If this material were played any quicker, its thinness and obviousness would smack the audience in the face like a coal shovel. How a huge audience can be magnetized by amateurish, headless, suspenseless pap like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and THE SIXTH SENSE in the same summer is beyond my reckoning. The lesson of SENSE and WITCH's success seems to be: Telling a story to a movie audience now is like telling a joke to a very slow twelve-year-old.

And I think when more people do that the hype is really gonna calm down.  After you aren't caught way off guard from the ending it's not THAT amazing.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film was the kid, Harley Joel Osment.  He stole every scene in the film and was so perfectly casted.  If only they had him play Anakin Skywalker, we'd be talking masterpiece for George Lucas.  Bruce Willis did a fine job himself for a much calmer roll then he's used to.  The directing and writing are both put together nicely and it holds your attention throughout and gets you tense when it wants you to.<br/><br/>The plot is so-so, nothing really new here other than being put together real well.  So what's my complain.  Well when Titanic came out and everyone was truly amazed by it and kept seeing it again some Leo guy haters had to ruin the movie and take it from #5 on the top 250 and sending it off the chart making it seem way overhyped.  So now a movie that really did deserve to be on the top 250 is knocked off even if it really did deserve Best Picture (come'on, if The Full Monty won would that make you happy?).  But if that was considered overhyped I can't wait to see this the same time next year.<br/><br/>Yes, it had an amazing ending, maybe one of the best since The Usual Suspects.  But is it as good as The Usual Suspects?  Very far from it.  Is it better than Braveheart, Close Encounters, 2001, Fargo, or Reservoir Dogs to name a few?  Hell no!  It wasn't the best film of the year either.  The Blair Witch Project was creepier, The Matrix was more jawdropping, and Go was more enjoyable.  But yet all three of those don't seem to get nearly the amount attention as this, and it confuses the hell out of me.<br/><br/>Next time please don't overhype a movie so much.

I also think Bruce Willis gave the performance of his career as the child psychologist trying to recuperate from a past incident with another patient he couldn't cure, and is trying to fix his mistake through Cole.  I also give M. Night Shyamalan all the credit in the world for writing AND directing this masterpiece of the movie.  Going in, I expected your average movie: not good, but not bad either.

Unless someone ruined the movie, there is no way you would ever guess it. The story is brilliant, the directing is well above average. But what most impressed me is the acting. The kid is one of the best actors I have ever seen. He is so totally believable! And Willis is amazing. He's not a hero, and he doesn't kill anybody. Instead he gives us a completely believable and sensitive performance. I hope he continues along this track. And I think we'll continue to see good things to come from Mr. Shyamalan."

","Fascinating psychological thriller about a young boy who is haunted by dead spirits and enlists the help and guidance of a child psychologist.

","I am not surprised the mass market likes this very mediocre movie, but I can't understand the near universal critical acclaim a movie like this can get. I admit my own bias - I hate movies about smary kids to begin with, nor do I care for obvious sentimentality,  but trying to be objective, the problem, as usual  is the script. It simply is average--the pacing is awkward and plodding; there is a serious lack of tension and momentum. I do not consider myself to be a literary genius, but have all the critics of today never seen a movie with good writing? (Mostly pre 1990). Are we really left with movies that go ""Boo."", (accompanied by the generic rumbling sound effect). Or are they only comparing movies to the other dismal offerings we get today (well,fair enough, perhaps). This movie was quite boring, and if I hadn't been nearly asleep thru most of it, I probably could have figured out the ""surprise."" <br/><br/>Mainly I enjoyed the Philadelphia locales."

Such as ""Arlington Road"", ""Varsity Blues"", ""American Pie"", ""Austin Powers 2"", ""Outside Providence"", ""The Mummy"", ""Bowfinger"", and even ""The Blair With Project"", but none have lived up to the excellence of ""The Sixth Sense"". ""The Sixth Sense"" is the best movie I have seen in a long time. You could actually feel Cole's anguish. And to those of you who don't like ""horror"" movies, this isn't one of them. This is a wonderful film, which will chill you at times, but it has no really gory parts. This is not a ""Scream"" movie, yet it has been #1 in the box office 5 weeks in a row! ""Star Wars"" wasn't even #1 that long! This is definitely the best movie of the year, and I don't expect to see a better one. Not only that, I expect that this film will be remembered as one of the greatest of all time. I wish I had a bigger scale! I give this a 10 out of 10, but wish I could give it a 20 out of 10!"

","An excellent film!  It reminded me of Fallen, (which I also liked a lot.) It is a little but scary at times, but not really a horror movie.  (One person in the theater shrieked with fear at one point, but she must have been a jumpy individual.)  Although there is plenty of suspense, this is a bit slower than Fallen, and lacks the struggle between good and evil.   What it does have is a very clever and carefully thought out plot which you must be patient to absorb and fully appreciate.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis does what he does best, which is play the husband who loves his wife very much but does not seem to have time for her because he is too busy helping people.  The kid is good, and not annoying like Anikan.<br/><br/>Do not see this movie if you are looking only for mindless fun to unwind some evening.  You will probably still enjoy it, but it is a little bit intense at times.  You may end up missing a lot too.  (See Deep Blue Sea or American Pie the night you want to unwind.  Those are good mindless fun.) Instead, see this movie on an evening when you are not completely stressed out and are willing to pay attention to details.<br/><br/>I give it two sense up. ;)"

I mainly liked it because it was so original. I got pretty freaked out with the vomiting little girl and the wife in the kitchen! There were some very humorous scenes, i loved the part when the big-shot actor of Cole's school Tommy Tommasimo got the part of the village idiot in the school play. And Cole finally realizes why he was given this gift. I'm not going through much detail cuz that would take too much of my time.

","Not to cast aspersions on any fellow critic, but I would recommend those of you perusing the comments on ""The Sixth Sense"" to avoid reading AliceG's undeservedly nasty diatribe. My guess is that AliceG just cannot accept any film that doesn't swell with Gothic imagery and a teeming moroseness; I would also assume that the movie's much-hyped ending had no effect on a soul so numbed by cynicism. But I digress...<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" is a tremendous achievement, a stunning end to a season that hung itself with bathroom humor and bathroom-quality films like ""Wild Wild West"" and ""The General's Daughter."" The acting, the script, and the direction rival that of any film I have seen; it is to M. Night Shyamalan's credit that ""The Sixth Sense"" reverberates with such heartening force.<br/><br/>I cannot adequately express in such a short space how impressive this movie really is. What Hollywood has needed for so long is fresh talent, and in Shyamalan and Haley Joel Osment, it is unearthed. As for Bruce Willis, the assessment that he is a one-dimensional, prototype badass character is unfair. He lets ""The Sixth Sense"" come to him, never emoting, a trait that has victimized some of his lesser Hollywood compatriots.<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" deserves all the merit it has received, and I think Shyamalan will reap what he has sown once Academy Award nominations are announced. A work such as this warrants the praise it has received."

Trust me, ""the twist"" is an honest to God ""twist and 1/2!""<br/><br/>Honestly, I was reluctant to see this movie at first because I was beginning to think that maybe the reason why mainstream audiences liked this film so much is because so many movies in 1999 were either sub-par or extremely over rated. I was already duped once this year by ""The Blair Witch Project"" but a close friend of my mine reassured me that The Sixth Sense had ""one of the best endings in movie history."" Thinking that his statement was a pretty bold one, I decided to check it out for myself. VERDICT: The Sixth Sense is thus far, the best film of the 1999.<br/><br/>When the twist came at the end, I haven't heard so many ""Oh's &  Ah's"" and even crying in a theatre in recent memory. As the credits were rolling, I was still sitting in my seat in a daze. Even an hour later, I was still pondering about it.<br/><br/>I'm admittedly very good at guessing ""the twist"" to movies because I've seen a lot of them and I'm a student of film. However, with The Sixth Sense, I just missed guessing ""the twist"" only by a hair. You see, I had a hunch that it was like the ending of a Twilight Zone episode called <POSSIBLE SPOILER>""The Hitch-Hiker"", however, I guessed the wrong character.<END POSSIBLE SPOILER>.<br/><br/>I could blab on like everybody else about how good the actors were in this film, but I'll spare you, because the real genius  is M.

Going back over the things the characters did and said, you find that everything matches up with the surprise ending perfectly - no holes.<br/><br/>Haley's acting is incredible, Bruce Willis' is acceptable and improves as the movie continues.

","An incredible film - the most suspenseful and frightening that I've seen in years. It's not a scary movie that's frightening because it's gross and disgusting. It's a scary movie that's simply scary, without special effects or excessive gore, which, to me, is the greatest kind of thriller that we see too little of these days.<br/><br/>_The Sixth Sense_ is exquisitely acted, written, and directed, with a score that brings the film chillingly to life. Bruce Willis (Malcolm Crowe) and Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear) have a chemistry and power together that is utterly believable. Their performances almost make you suspend reality and believe that the characters are real people.<br/><br/>Another thing that struck me is the attention to detail and the research that went into the storyline. Being a paranormal buff, the movie didn't look too promising as far as realistic paranormal investigation goes. However, the attention to free association writing, electronic voice phenomena, cold spots, a spirit's violent actions, and the stress the ability to ""see dead people"" puts on someone, especially a young child, was amazing. If you're into ghosts and the paranormal, this is definitely a film for you, and will strike you as being more than just ""a scary movie.""<br/><br/>Just a word of warning: Don't let your guard down. If you don't like sudden parts, this may not be a movie for you. Go with a friend or family member who's already seen it and can tell you if something is sudden is going to happen. I usually don't like movies with any sudden parts, but I think this film, without that suspense, would not nearly be as good.<br/><br/>I don't think there was anything that I didn't like about the movie... it's most definitely worth the ticket price and should be seen on the big screen in order to get the full effect, like _The Haunting_. I guarantee the story will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the ending will shock you - Everyone says it, don't think it's hype. It really will.

Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a renowned child psychologist sees a chance at redemption and validation in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a quite, compassionate child that has symptoms uncannily similar to those of Dr. Crowe's previous failed patient. Sixth shows a very human foundation, pulling viewers through an emotional roller coaster of suspense, glimmers of hope, and a corkscrew of a plot twist at the end that will have you doing double takes.  Bruce Willis shows his talent by playing an unusually passive role and allowing focus to fall on Haley Osment's projection of despair.  Haley's brilliance seems to outshine his age and reach to the level of ability far beyond that of a stereotypical child actor.  Sixth doesn't fall into a specific genre, which only helps to increase its believability factor.  Because the camera puts there with Cole through his most personal experiences, you feel his suffering, and understand his despair.  Hollywood, this is what movie watchers want to see.

Some people, upon knowing about a trick ending, tend to try too hard to ""predict"" it and when they do, it takes away the pure joy of seeing the movie and not expecting anything. they are too smart for their own good.

Most of the scenes are either fake and stagey, redundant, irrelevant, obvious, or all of the above, and they are edited together with the sloppiest imprecision.  There is no sense of drama, mystery or anything else.<br/><br/>Although some of the imagery is imaginative and the production design is superb, they are placed in the service of an inert, smug and witless vision, presumably that of its writer/director.

","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is a  very good film. Had it not been for it's unarguably clever and surprising ending, it would have been fairy entertaining, by the numbers fare. But the finale does elevate it past that level. However, even with that surprise, the film felt oddly incomplete to me.<br/><br/>The film's problem doesn't lie in it's acting. All performances are solid (although the great Olivia Williams is criminally under-used). Toni Collette was especially winning in her role as the Coles Sear's (Joey Hale Osmont) mother. The scene towards the end, when Cole shares his secret with her, it the most touching of the film. An unrecognizable Donnie Osmond gives a very brief, yet powerful performance as well. Bruce Willis and the child (whose name I may have incorrect about) are also good, but their performances are one note. Willis is believeable as the pensive, clever doctor but, with a few exceptions, never really emotes seriously. Osment's performance is perhaps the most overrated aspect of the film. I will be seeing this film again, and will try to pay more attention to him, but after my initial viewing, I wondered what all the fuss was about. True, he does a good job with the interesting character, but he never comes out of his disturbed, whispering mode.<br/><br/>Set in Philadelphia in the fall, the atmosphere of the film is successfully bleak and eerie. The chills, when they come, are very well done and will make you jump, but they're awfully spread out (the first hour of the film, for the most part, was dull)<br/><br/>The main distraction for me, however, was that the film aspired to  be more than it really was. Willis and Osment meet for the first time, in a church. This church is used a few times throughout the film, but there really is no point to it. The spirituality of the sixth sense and of the character who has it is never explained throughout the film. Also, I wish they had elaborated more on the divorce of the boy's parents. It could have given more insight on both the mother and her son.<br/><br/>For the most part, Sixth Sense, was an very well done film. Very well worth the price of admission. However it had a big weakness-it hinted at several thing but never really explained them. 3/4 or 7/10."

","It really isn't Hitchcock's ghost who directed this excellent film. It is a twenty-nine year old, who tackles concepts like death and caring. A review of his previous films suggests that the theme of the child and mentor is an important one for the director. This is a film that captures the shadows of the past cast forward in time and especially in Philadelphia. It should be an Oscar nominee for best picture. It will certainly be a popular one judging by the word of mouth."

","I went to see The Sixth Sense recently and I was very surprised at how the story was pulled off. Surprised in a very good way, I must say. I thought it was great how the writers took horror to another level, unlike scream etc... I must admit that I almost screamed 4 or 5 times during the movie, even though a lot of people have said that it isn't scary at all. The story was very interesting and the actors were great. I applaud Haley Joel Osment for his brilliant performance and I do the same for Bruce Willis', who should try to make more movies like this one before going back to his bang bang action movies. I loved the twist at the end of the movie and unlike other people, I didn't see it coming at all.

I was so enraptured by the storytelling and pace that I didn't see where the plot was headed. Each scene has definite purpose and gives us further insight into the characters.<br/><br/>Simply the best movie I've seen this year (1999). Haley Joel Osment deserves an Oscar nomination. This is not an easy role for a kid to play and he holds his own in every scene w/Mr. Willis. Little Haley Joel supposedly made the director cry while delivering his lines. That is powerful acting. I would rate his performance among the best by a young actor, ranking close to Leonardo Dicaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and Anna Paquin in ""The Piano.""<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, and I suspect there will be a few that decide not to go, I urge you to go see it even if you are averse to the ""horror genre"".

","WARNING -- this review MAY contain spoilers, but I've taken great care to write it very discreetly so that you shouldn't be affected by the review if you haven't yet watched the movie -- WARNING<br/><br/>The plot twist in the Sixth sense makes the movie. Think of the plot twist (which is revealed at the very end) like a fine silk robe.<br/><br/>Except it's ruined because it's full of holes.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, the psycho shoots Bruce Willis and kills himself.<br/><br/>Then it says ""NEXT FALL"", and the movie continues from there. Over a year later, where Bruce Willis meets the boy.<br/><br/>That's first hole. Would Bruce Willis go for over a year not knowing the secret? (By, the secret, I mean what you, the viewer, would know after the plot twist is revealed, at the end of the movie.)<br/><br/>Also, if the secret would hold true, Cole's (The boy's) mother should never have spoken with Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Also, all of the ghosts that the boy sees are scary. They all have their death marks on them. The 1970's teen ghost has his head blown off. The girl ghost pukes up her poisoned insides. The housewife ghost shows her slashed wrists. But the secret of the movie does not follow this same pattern with the doctor ghost. You never see any wounds on the doctor ghost. Hmm... well unless that's because he never turns his back during the whole movie?? You wouldn't see the wound on the 1970's teen ghost if he never turned around either... but I'm not sure... maybe I should watch it again?... Also, none of the other ghosts speak. They stare blankly and then walk away. Why would that ghost doctor speak then?????? It makes no sense!!!<br/><br/>The worst part is, again, that it continues over a year later after Bruce Willis gets wounded. I mean, Bruce Willis would NOT have gone for over a year without knowing the secret. Seriously. If all the other points I listed above where little holes in my silk robe, pin holes even, then this fact is like a giant tear. The movie should've continued in the next day, or next week after he gets hit. Not ""NEXT FALL"". UHHHHhhhh.<br/><br/>Other than that though, a great movie, which promotes post-movie conversation."

""The Sixth Sense"" is not at all similar to ""Mercury Rising"", which some people were saying before the film came out. Bruce Willis is probably in his best film role in years as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the psychologist who's patient Cole Sears (Haley Jole Osment is wonderful as the young child, should get some oscar potential as well) has the ability, to, well, you know. Toni Collete is good as Cole's mother who wants to know what's wrong with him. Olvia Williams is also quite good as Malcolm's wife. The director and writer of the film, M.

"Djung-4","Null","0","0","24 August 1999"," Mother more compelling than shrink
","Coming into Sixth Sense I expected a movie about a boy who sees dead people while those around him don't, and the shrink who tries to help him.  That was as much as I had allowed myself to absorb.<br/><br/>Osment's performance as isolated little Cole, whose only anchor is his mother, was quite touching.  Osment's stillness for the camera, his prolonged moments of gravity and wide-eyed stares served as acute counterpoints to his contemporaries' careless, energetic tumblings.  The lingering shots on Osment's smallest twitch and occasional tear-welling eyes allowed his talent to shine through wonderfully .  He has remarkable control.  I don't know if I say this in light of the fact that he's a child, or regardless of the fact that he's a child.<br/><br/>I found Cole's relationship with his mother to be much more compelling than Cole's relationship with Malcolm Crowe (Willis).  The most real moments for me were those in which Cole's mother brushes past inexplicable manifestations of Cole's affliction/curse/gift -- when she senses something out-of-the-ordinary and yet refuses to acknowledge them, perhaps because to do so would be to brand Cole as the freak that his peers accuse him of being.  These moments of almost-acknowledgment made me wonder how I would react to proof of something outside of science, something that common sense tells me shouldn't be possible, shouldn't be happening, but is.    This is the underlying ambition of a lot of scary movies; Sixth Sense succeeds in raising this what-if question more than any other offering in the same genre that I've seen in the last couple of years.  The first instance is when Cole's mother leaves the kitchen for an instance only to return to find every single one of the kitchen drawers and cabinets opened and pulled out, and Cole sitting with his hands plastered to the kitchen table.  No sound had been made in her absence; there was no way Cole could have pulled that stunt by himself, and no discernible reason for him to do so even if he could.  So what could have happened?  Cole's mother deflects any possibility of supernatural agents by saying, ""Baby, were you looking for something?"" To which Cole mumbles ""Pop tarts.""<br/><br/>On the flip side of love and protectiveness, Cole, in his turn, seeks to protect his mother from what he perceives as his curse, his freakishness. Cole's deep love and feelings of protectiveness towards his mother mirror her feelings towards him but with a much different impact coming from a young and vulnerable child.  Osment's portrayal of adult responsibilities in a small, fragile package, his taking over, in a weird way, of the parenting role with his mother, made him an even more sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Willis as Malcolm Crowe.  Perhaps it's me bringing my baggage of Willis from his days in Moonlighting (tv series) and his action flicks (Die Hard, Armageddon etc.) but Willis' face is forever associated with a little half-quirk of the lips and a twinkle in the eyes, or a kick-ass frown and smirk.  Willis playing the pensive psychiatrist just came across to me as wooden.  It was very quiet, very still, but not very confidence-inspiring. I didn't buy Cole's gradual conversion to Crowe from his initial sprint to the church to his eventual heartfelt confessions.<br/><br/>Having Cole come to resolution with his curse/gift through the guidance of Crowe made sense in that Cole's mother was unable to acknowledge her son's difference, but it was not altogether convincing.  Nevertheless, a REALLY good movie, and one that made me hide my eyes until the ghosts were gone."

","The word of mouth (WOM) on this movie has been huge and I finally got around to seeing it after 4 weeks and I'm glad I did. If you have not seen it yet DO NOT KNOW THE ENDING. I won't even hint at it here except to say it is one the best in movie history. This is easily one of the best 3 films of year (among The Matrix, EdTV and Thomas Crown). I had tears running down my cheeks about 4 different times throughout this film and all because I cared about the kid. Haley Joe Osment gives the best child performance I've ever seen (even topping those given in CE3K and ET and Sleepers) as a sweet and troubled child who sees ghost. He should be a lock for a nomination for best lead actor Oscar (but then again ""Shakespeare..."" won a ""best film"" Oscar last year). Bruce Willis is wonderful as a sympathetic shrink trying to treat the kid (anybody who saw ""Nobody's Fool"" will not be surprised by his work here) and Toni Collette (who?) is just right as the kid's mom. Also Olivia Williams is very fine and very beautiful as Willis's wife. Writer-director M. Night Smyamalan trusts the intelligence of his audience by giving us a screenplay as heart-tugging as ""Titanic"" or ""Field Of Dreams"". The scares here are creepy but not shocking. He's too smart for that and they work because we really care about the people in the movie. His direction is virtually perfect. James Newton Howard's score is his best since ""Grand Canyon"" and just as memorable (I can't wait to buy it). I'd heard that it was an excellent movie, but I still wasn't prepared by how good it was. The thing that really sets it apart is that for a scary movie it is touches your heart and in that respect it reminds me of ""Ghost"" (although this is much scarier) and ""Jacob's Ladder""."

","A character driven, chilling movie.  It is rare to find heart and Soul in any recent film, The Sixth Sense renewed my interest in going to the movies. It doesn't worry about being new, cute, breaking new effects, or splatter. The hugely positive audience response shows that well thought out ideas with fully realized character will still draw audiences in.  My theatre was packed with teens the day before school resumed, they talked and giggled for awhile, but utter stillness slowly pervaded the darkness.  The scares sucked us in, but the intense feelings between characters amplified that first goosebump into a lasting chill.  Even if you figured out the ending, it is the precise execution that make this a killergood movie. <br/><br/>
I will lose faith in the Academy if they overlook Osment's amazing performance.  Most child actors are only able to become a blank slate for the audience to project feeling onto--Anna Paquin in The Piano--and that is no mean achievement for actor and director.  But Osment creates a subtle and stricken character, it is his constant intensity that ignites our fear. Loved this movie!"

The boy who plays Cole, the child who can see dead people, (I just looked his name up but it escapes me right now) is wonderful. This is one of the few child actors I don't want to smack around 5 minutes into the film.

","I liked this movie.  It was perhaps not fair to The Sixth Sense that the night before I rented ""Seven"" and was on the edge of my seat the entire time (if you haven't seen Seven yet, rent it!), so this film was probably unfairly influenced by my having seen an incredibly tightly written and acted thriller the night before.  Still, The Sixth Sense is a fine movie with plenty of psychological suspense.  I liked the premise -- that the spirits of dead people can communicate with certain ""chosen"" ones among us -- and the ending is indeed totally unexpected, as I'd read on this site. The young actor who plays Cole, Haley Joel Osment, was excellent in portraying a terrified child who doesn't want the gift he was born with, and even Bruce Willis was decent (I don't usually like Willis's acting, which I think is typically one dimensional, not to mention his trade-mark smirk).

","This was a old fashion Ghost Story.  The best movie I have seen in years! Smart, spooky, mysterious with a great ending.  This was a really good movie even for the kids.  My two girls, ages 10 and 5 loved it as did my older kids. Thumbs up from everyone I know."

","First, this is a great film.  Wasn't expecting the ghosts (fortunately, I did not see the trailer), so they really scared the pants off of me. In fact, I had to come to the office alone the day after I saw the film (a Sunday), and I really got the heebie-jeebies. And it's not easy to get a 30-year old man creeped out, I tell you.<br/><br/>However, I didn't find the twist THAT unexpected. I was told there was a twist, and if you're a movie freak like me, your mind goes into overdrive while the movie progresses trying to figure it out. Anyway, I figured it out and the ending had less of an impact on me, but nothing can take away the fact that it was a great movie overall.<br/><br/>""Planet of the Apes"" and ""The Game"" - now those were movies that really caught me in the end (I figured out ""Usual Suspects""'s ending too)."

","Summary:<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays Malcolm, one of the most successful psychologists in Philadelphia whose life has fallen apart because of the actions of one of his former patients whom he failed to cure.  He is determined to make amends by dedicating his life to save a young boy who showed the same psychological systems his ""failed patient"" had.  That boy is Cole, who has a terrible secret that he won't tell anyone, especially his mom because he does not want her to see him as everyone else does.  But what is his terrible secret, why is he always getting strange scratches and bruises, and why is he afraid all of the time?  Can Malcolm get Cole to trust him enough to tell his secret, so that Malcolm can cure him and they both can have peace of mind?<br/><br/>
Cons:<br/><br/>-Not scary -Wanted some more closure from ending<br/><br/>
Pros:<br/><br/>-Great acting from the entire cast, especially from the kid who plays the haunted boy Cole.  He is phenomenal! -Very good job of cinematography with some very interesting looking shots. -Good job by director and soundtrack composer at building the right atmosphere to develop genuine feelings of eerieness, creepiness, and suspense during the movie's key scenes -Tremendous payoff twist revealed at the movie's end...it's so obvious thru-out the progression of the movie that most people won't even see it--I completely missed it till the end!<br/><br/>My Overall Rating: 8 out of 10.  Excellent.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line:<br/><br/>Great movie with even greater acting.  Give the kid that plays Cole an Oscar, please!  I just wish the director/writer exploited more opportunities to make the movie more scary and horrifying--the potential for this to be an awesome terrifying, disturbing film is glaringly there.  Still, again this is a great movie that fits better as a moving, suspenseful-drama rather than a horror flick as advertised."
"dvder","9","0","0","22 August 1999"," Damn, I loved this movie!
","Combining elements of drama, thriller, and horror, this film could easily have been a muddled disaster.  Indeed, the trailer didn't give a good impression of which type of movie to expect.  Happily, the blend works beautifully, mostly thanks to the unbelievably mature performance of 11-year-old Osment and an amazing ending that will make you want to watch the movie all over again.<br/><br/>The film opens with a harrowing scene that sets the tone for some of the more disturbing images to come.  Successful child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) and his wife (Williams) are celebrating at home after he wins an award, when they are accosted by Vincent Grey (an emaciated and very frightening Wahlberg), a former patient who blames Crowe for failing to help him.  The deranged Vincent first shoots Crowe in the stomach, then kills himself.  Fast forward to Crowe meeting Cole Sear (Osment, best known as the son of Forrest Gump and last seen in Bogus), a young boy who suffers from the same type of ""mood disorder"" that Vincent did.  Gaining the tormented child's confidence, Crowe eventually discovers that Cole thinks he is being visited by ""dead people.""  Crowe's initial skepticism gives way after he hears something strange on an old tape recording of a session with Vincent. Together, he and Cole try to discover a reason for the visitations so that Cole won't have to live in fear any more.  Meanwhile, his obsession with the boy threatens to derail his marriage as his wife becomes increasingly distant.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense works because it plays out like a really good short story. The more dramatic moments are emotionally engaging, and humor is used to complement them.  The brief scenes involving ghosts are quite creepy (thanks to their generally shocking nature and some fine makeup by Stan Winston). The characters of Cole and Crowe are well-developed, and convincingly portrayed.  Willis, coming off the disappointing Mercury Rising, gives the man-helps-wunderkind premise another go, and this time he comes out a winner with an unexpectedly warm performance.  Williams is used sparingly, but serves the story well.  Collette is also effective as Cole's beleaguered mother.  Best of all, though, is Osment.  He gives Cole both the haunted maturity and wide-eyed terror needed to play a boy who is routinely subjected to horrific encounters with wronged ghosts.  Given his tender age, he is almost impossibly good, certainly good enough to merit Oscar consideration.  He and Willis work well together; there is a quirky chemistry between them that makes for some funny moments in the film.<br/><br/>Director M. Night Shyamalan (whose Dickensian name somehow fits this movie perfectly) once again explores the reactions of young children to traumatic events-- basically the same territory he covered in 1998's Wide Awake (which featured a similarly adult performance by young Joseph Cross).  At only 28, Shyamalan has already developed a strong style as both a writer and director.  Even in the slower moments, The Sixth Sense has enough intensity to keep things interesting, and it is capped off by a twist ending that is wickedly clever without seeming contrived."

","Excellent in every way. Exquisitely plotted; striking, moody cinematography and direction; fine performances; a thoughtful, intelligent, deeply moving film. Though well-stocked with gore effects and some stunning shocks, its overall mood is cold, calm and still, and its theme on many levels is the need to communicate, to tell something, something that untold will not let the soul rest. Absolutely beautiful, and tied off with a blind-siding twist ending that you will *never* see coming but that makes perfect sense the moment you comprehend it. Four stars!"

","A film that could have been.... I read many of the reviews here,  and considering most gave this film a solid ""thumbs up"", I thought I'd check it out. I left the movie wondering where it went wrong. I could not pin-point what faults the movie held, but I was certain that script wasn't air-tight. The bulk of the film was drawn out and the dialogue got painfully slow and awkward at times. The intrigue of knowing the child's secret was the only real mystery of the movie, and that was revealed far too early, letting my interest and attention slide as the film progressed. In fact, the only factor that saves this movie from getting a toilet-worthy rating its clever and unexpected ending. Worth a 2 dollar admission, but not by much."

","I saw this movie last night and have never been so emotionally and physically affected by one movie in my entire life. It wasn't even the terror it installed in me or even the pity I had for the little boy, that made me actually sick to my stomach. It was the raw emotion in the acting and the images on the screen. I just wish that I had waited and rented this movie so I wouldn't have to sit in a theatre full of people who didn't like the uncomfortable and upsetting feelings and giggled uncertainly at the little boy with the hole in the back of his head. Oh yes, America, go ahead. Laugh at the dead little boy skipping off to find his father's gun. Oh isn't he SO amusing. F**k you all. anyways . . . moving on. :)<br/><br/>I was stunned by the beautiful and sickening (in the good way) displays of raw emotion in the movie. I had expected it to be just like ""a scary movie."" And sure there were times that it scared the hell out of me, but most often it made me cry. The first ghost, the woman in the kitchen was by far the most effective. When she whirled around screaming ""No, dinner isn't ready yet, and you can't hurt me anymore!"" I burst into uncontrollable sobs while the guy next to me laughed confusedly. The acting was so amazing, not only with stunning performances by the boy and child psychiatrist but the dead people too. I was haunted all night by the face of the little girl crouched under her bed and by the screams of the man trapped in the room. I left the theatre with a pounding headache, a gut wrenching stomach ache and images of the dead and suffering burned into my head. I went home and wished for once that I was one of those desenstized Americans who could see someone mentally decompose and giggle. I wanted to forget the feelings that I'd had. I wanted to be able to sleep. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen. With ingenius camera angles and images and the best acting I have seen in a film since SLC Punk! it is a haunting movie that will hopefully move you in ways you've never been moved before."

Many aspects of this film were certainly above average but I fail to see how this could be considered a classic many years from now or even one of the best films of the year. The films un-doing lies in its ending. At the moment when that key element of the plot falls into place it certainly does seem interesting. Yet, as soon as one begins to think about it and its repercussions on the plot, the film comes to pieces. If the film had chosen a logical ending to fill in the stories more than obvious holes, I might have felt not quite as cheated. If u really must go see it, pay attention to Haley Joel Osments performance, definitely one of the least annoying from a child actor. A very generous 5/10."

I have not seen anything he'd directed, or written prior to this, but he's proven with one movie that he's great in both fields. The direction of the film is marvelous. He creates an air to the film, it creeps you out, and may even scare you. He does this without millions of dollars in special effects, he simply does it with make-up, a great script, and great direction. The script isn't great just because it can creep you out however, nor is it the marvelous ending, instead it's the fact that the script plays the viewer like a piano. The writer/director makes us make these simple assumptions. Little things. Things so common that they don't need to be said, and then he has us slapping our forehead for making the assumption later. It's an excellent example that nothing is what it seems, and we should never assume. Truly excellent."

I thought this was a wonderful change for Bruce Willis, it showed he is a wonderful actor and able to portray any role he is in. The child was absolutely magnificent! He had me convinced he was seeing dead people! Hope to see this film at least nominated for some award. It really reminded my of an old Hitchcock film.

","The trailers for this film piqued my interest only slightly; to me, it looked like another generic ghost/horror story.  Thank god my boyfriend insisted upon seeing it, because frankly I can't remember the last time I saw such an intriguing and well done film.  The actors are wonderful, not to mention the little boy.  This is no Macaulay Culkin; he is nothing less than believable, and his rivetingly palpable terror will draw you in.  The story can be just a tad slow at times, and you're not always sure where the film is going.  However, there are quite a number of refreshingly unexpected twists, and the ending shocked even jaded me.<br/><br/>I rarely get excited by movies, but I left _The Sixth Sense_ absolutely exhilarated.

For me, the movie had a few high points, especially a late, emotional scene between Cole and his mother in a car, but I felt the story could have been told better, and that the writer/director kept too much information ""secret"" for too long, in order to make the twist ending work. The ghostly visitations were scary at first- especially the initial one by the woman in the robe-- but then became kind of cheap and ""fake"" to me.

","Superb horror/thriller about a little boy who can see dead people and Bruce Willis as a child psychiatrist trying to help him cope with it.  The film is VERY quiet and very dark (it's filmed with everything in shadows or darkness...everything in this film looks dark).  It also manages to scare you without blood or gore.  The film also takes time to establish characters and motivation (how many horror films can you say that about?).  It's a solid hour before the kid confides in Willis, but by then you know (and care) about him.  Then, to top it off, there's an incredible twist at the end that makes you replay the whole film in your mind.  If you like quiet, creepy horror thrillers see this film!

"DemonE-2","9","0","0","18 August 1999"," An awesome film, with great acting, an engrossing story, and an ending from way left field
","This summer is a great one for movies.  After the first Star Wars film in 15 years, two awesome comedies in Austin Powers 2 and South Park, and two great horror films (Blair Witch and The Haunting), the Sixth Sense comes out - and continues the trend. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment both turn in excellent performances.  There needs to be a Child Actor Oscar created just for Osment; he is fantastic as young Cole Sear, a child who sees ghosts everywhere he goes.  Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe; a child psychologist discouraged by his one failure, with a case that bears a striking resemblance to Cole's.<br/><br/>The film grabs you right from the start, and doesn't let go until the end. Although billed as a horror movie, the scares don't really start until about halfway through, when Cole's ghosts become visible to the audience.  And they're sufficiently creepy - real people bearing the marks of their deaths, as opposed to the translucent shapes of The Haunting.  The ghost-story elements are all there, in both the actions of the spirits and their effects (the cold, the feeling of falling while standing still), lending this film much more credibility than The Haunting - ghost story fans will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Malcolm has his hands full trying to help Cole overcome his fear of the apparitions and try to come to terms with his ability to see them, but as a result his home life collapses as he drifts further and further from his wife.  Ironically, his patient becomes the doctor, helping Malcolm to try to patch things up.  The two work superbly together throughout the movie in fact.<br/><br/>The ending, when it comes, is a complete surprise, from so far out of left field it practically skirts the foul line.  I was left with my jaw in my lap as the credits rolled.  The Sixth Sense stacks up as one of the best ghost movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the best movies of the summer. Stick it on your must see list, right alongside The Blair Witch Project."

"Synch-2","9","0","0","18 August 1999"," Very Orginal
","Going into the movie I thought that this was going to your typical horror movie. When you first see the commercials for this movie you are to assume that the ghosts the little boys sees are evil. As you watch the movie you feel that this assumption is in correct. The little boy becomes horrified by the images he is forced to watch. The ghosts all have minds of their own. These aren't the typical ghosts we are so used to seeing in films. All of them walk around not even knowing they are dead. That is what scares the little boy through out the entire film. Why I liked this film was because of its originality. Yes there have been films about people talking to ghosts. But never have we seen ""talking to ghosts"" so dark, gritty, eerie, and real as this film. For instance, the movie, Ghost, where a man dies and comes back to figure out the reason for his death and to help his love in fear of her demise as well in the process. That movie was scary in its own way but also had light hearted humor. It also had the subplot of true love. Six sense on the other hand I feel is the complete opposite from Ghost. True both movies do have the same premise. But as I said Six sense took the whole idea of talking to the dead to a different level as Ghost did. Instead of making light hearted jokes that amused you, like Ghost, it made fun of people and also made u feel bad laughing at them (example the couple buying the wedding ring). and I would also like to point out the movie did have a few faults to it, and a few holes, but overall I felt that this was a very good film and very original. It has made a very good addition to the horror genre . Even though I feel it has many other aspects to it than just being a horror."

This movie does not use cheap special effects to get its point across, but rather, a tight, concise dialog that works from beginning to end.

One of the best things about this film is its ability to be watched a second and a third time.  You are compelled to test the film and its ending to see if you can come up with any mistakes or holes but there are none.  This film is amazing.  Add to all this some flawless filming.  Good, consistent camera angles and movement that are paced just perfectly with the story.  Its a movie with just the right tint of darkness. Bruce Willis is wonderful in this film displaying so much emotion and depth and Haley Joel Osment plays the tortured child to chilling perfection.  You leave the theater wishing that kid the best in therapy! His performance puts him up there with Linda Blair! ""The Sixth Sense,"" is way ahead of the pack as far as summer horror movies go.

Haley Joel Osment is the greatest child actor I have ever seen.  He did not get fake and was very convincing.  I did not feel that he was reading from a script to me.

","From the trailers and the posters advertised in the newspapers, my first reaction was, great. Another dumpy special effects bonanza with CGI ghosts, no plot, and bad acting.  Just what we need.  The critics rave reviews got me interested(they should advertise the movie).  I went to see it, and was, to say the least, delighted with what I saw.  I was deeply touched by it. It's not some scary monster movie with corny acting and CGI ghosts like the remake of ""The Haunting"".  In fact, there isn't a single special effect in ""The Sixth Sense"".  Not one.  It doesn't need effects,  because it's about facing the most frightening point of our lives, death.  I walked out of the theater feeling the same way as I did when I came out of Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"", and that was very happy.  This is the first film about death that made me feel good, and ready to accept death at the time I may face it.  ""Ghost"" is the wrong film to watch, because it made me scared of death.  ""The Seventh Seal"" was about using the time you have left to live, so that didn't have a real positive impact on me either.  ""The Sixth Sense"" did, and I was really happy about it.  Despite it's 1 or 2 Hollywood cliches, ""The Sixth Sense"" is an important film for our lives because it teaches us to face death, to accept it, and to not be afraid.  There were times in the movie when I thought to myself, why are the spirits the boy sees splattered with gore, blood, and muck?  Is this supposed to scare us? Are blood and gore Hollywood's only idea of death?  No.  It's simply the way the spirits died.  The tagline says, ""Not every gift is a blessing"".  I disagree.  I thought that the boy WAS blessed with a gift, yet he was frightened by it and he did not understand it.  I think the advertising campaign needs to rethink their methods of advertising ""The Sixth Sense"", because they make it look like a stupid special effects fest, which it is not.  I would remove some of the cliches here and there, and I still think ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the best film of the year.  Still, I liked this film very much.  I was deeply moved and touched by it.  I think it's important that people see this film.  It might change their lives!"

Night Shyamalan can be credited for a thoughtful script that deals intelligently with life and death. The performances are uniformly superb. Bruce Willis has never been regarded as much of an actor, but here he gives a nice understated performance that gives the film its weight. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mom, frustrated over her inability to understand what her son is going through. Olivia Williams is wasted in a role that doesn't give her much to do. Donnie Wahlberg is great in his two minutes as a clinically depressed patient. Still, the film wouldn't work without the brilliant performance of little Haley Joel Osment, who gives one of the best performances of the year and perhaps one of the best child performances ever. This kid is great! He projects a great sorrow and pain in his role, and acts better than most seasoned actors. I hope that come the end of the year, he will have gotten a deserved Oscar nod.

Cole's mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is having difficulty enough raising the boy on her own.  It does not help that the child is shy, sullen, and prone to sudden fits of unexplained panic.  Grasping for redemption, Dr. Crowe treats the troubled lad, eventually befriending him.  For only when Crowe earns Cole's trust can the boy fully explain his secret.  It would be wrong of me to divulge anything further.  The rest of the movie's secrets I shall leave for you to discover.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is a triumph of tone and ambiance.  It manages to startle us, to make us grab the forearm of the person at our side, and to gasp at strategic moments.  With the aid of cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs), director M. Night Shyamalan infuses every shot with dread and foreboding.  In short, it is a highly successful thriller.  Yet its most impressive accomplishment is that it does not skimp on drama.  The movie is populated with three-dimensional characters that behave in real and honest ways.  Take Toni Collette as the boy's mother.  In a standard thriller, this character would be a throw-away, serving no purpose other than to complain to her son and disbelieve him at crucial points.  But in The Sixth Sense, the mother is a concerned parent who is struggling to put food on the table and maintain her own sanity, much less the sanity of her son.  She is a living, breathing person with strengths and weaknesses.  As a result, we empathize with her.  The same holds true for all of the supporting players, including the Doctor's neglected wife.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie lies is the burgeoning friendship between Willis and Osment.  It works wonderfully, thanks in large part to Osment's outstanding performance.  Not since Radio Flyer and E.T. have I been so impressed with a young actor's abilities.  When the boy is in the throes of a panic attack, you feel it.  When he warily backs away from Dr. Crowe during their first meeting, you feel his hesitation as if it were your own.  By his own standards, Bruce Willis turns in a relatively strong performance.  It may lack the emotion of In Country and the flair of Death Becomes Her, but it is certainly two notches above his typical action work, such as his role in Striking Distance.  One element that I found lacking for much of the film was the relationship between Crowe and his wife.  Their estrangement seemed arbitrary, more a result of screenwriting necessity than of real life problems.  By the picture's conclusion, however, this plot line was sewn up nicely.<br/><br/>The film has a unique conclusion, which will have viewers discussing it in the lobby, in the car on the way home, and around the water cooler the next day.  Some will love the ending.  Most will be surprised by it, but some will not.  I have mixed feelings in that while I found the final revelation to be intriguing, I wonder if it throws off the movie's delicate balance, sending it into standard thriller territory.   The conclusion is not gimmicky, yet it is startling.  The Sixth Sense is such a sincere and honest film that I question whether it needed that final twist.  Oh, and I also saw it coming from a mile away."

","When I had first saw the preview/ad for the 6th Sense, my immediate reaction was 1) another bad Bruce Willis sci-fi picture with a lot of hokey special effects and 2) what an amazing job they did on his hair.  So I avoided it the first few weeks of release.  Then I looked at the its box office totals and was shocked to see it not only number one but not losing much of its business. I also spoke to some friends who saw it and they said it was not what they expected it to be - go see it.<br/><br/>So I went last night (by the way I saw a 640PM Thursday show in Manhattan and the medium sized theatre we were in was packed) and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. It is not quite the psychological terror/horror film I thought it was.  Rather this movie is very thought provoking.  Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job as the boy Bruce Willis' character is trying to help.  I think that his performance is certainly Oscar worthy. Bruce Willis is also very good in his very subdued (""Anti-Bruce"") performance. Former New Kid on the Block Donnie Wahlberg also gives a very brief but powerful performance that sets the stage for the movie's plot. Go see this movie, unlike a couple of pictures I saw this summer, it does not disappoint and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Not as scary as the name or ads would leave you to believe (and you eventually get use to Bruce's hairdo)."

","I read a lot about the movie being so slow paced and long...I think that this is a really great movie...someone wrote about this being similar to one of those Hitchcock thrillers...I totally agree.Its full of suspense...the kind of suspense that keeps building up until you are truly frightened.

Everything is hair raising in this one.The thing is though, that the long ""prelude"" to the action is definitely necessary, otherwise, we would not be so surprisingly scared when the ""action"" came along...it's a well told story.The kid is incredible...every emotion is displayed in him..fear, sadness, and despair.  For those of you horror fans out there, this is the sort of movie that reminds us of the film ""The Entity""....neither of them have to depend on special effects to give us a good scare, even though ""The Entity"" is far more terrifying, even more so under the assumption that its based on a true story.Either way, I believe The Sixth Sense is one of the best films of the year.You get some horror and a lot of suspense and drama.Believe me, that dark hallway in your house will seem far more darker and scarier once you see this one."

","Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a typical Bruce Willis flick or yet another cheesy horror movie. I'm not a fan of either, but absolutely loved this movie. Is this movie perfect? Definitely not. But it is one of the best movies of the year, and perhaps one of the best all-time for its genre.<br/><br/>I think the distributors actually mis-marketed this movie as strictly a horror movie. In reality, it is much more of a drama or human interest story. The plot, character development, and acting are what really make this movie, not the occasional scare. In fact the acting is likely (I hope) to produce at least a couple Oscar nominations. I hope the Academy members have the guts to nominate Haley Joel Osment, he absolutely deserves it.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is the drive home afterwards. You'll replay every scene in your head realizing how everything makes sense. So, go see this movie immediately!!

","This movie tries to do just a bit too much, but does most of it well.  I loathe Bruce Willis, and he turns in yet another stone-faced performance here as what should be a very emotional role.  The kid is great.  He may look like Anakin or Macauly Culkin, but he knows how to poke fun at patronizing adults without being cute.  As far as plot goes, the movie starts out very psychological, until the ""I see dead people"" line, when it turns into a supernatural thriller.  The psych could have work if they had stuck with it, but once Willis believes the kid, all the analysing goes out the window.<br/><br/>The gore and scares are not gratuitous, but are unnecessary; the movie works so well intellectually and emotionally, it doesn't need to work physically by startling the audience.<br/><br/>In summation: The communication-with-the-dead plot works, but isn't deep enough.  Either the psychology or the gore could complement it for a superb movie, but they clash with each other.<br/><br/>But by the final revelation, this sin is forgiven as a twist that would make Hitchcock proud comes out.  It leaves a few plot holes, but you won't care."

Sixth Sense has one and it pulls you into the movie and keeps you engaged to the very end. There are one or two points that will make you jump but the writer/director doesn't send out any 'cheap shots' just to get that reaction out of the audience. They have a purpose and serve to move the story along. The director seems to have chosen to take a leisurely pace, allowing the story to tell itself. I would advise you NOT to ask anyone that has seen this picture about it. There are things best left unexplained for you to discover on your own at the same time as the characters on the screen. This is one that never telegraphs any of its secrets except in hindsight. Please, PLEASE, Hollywood: Take a lesson and make more of these intelligent, absorbing movies that can take your breath away in one moment and leave you with a tear in your eye the next.

","I was thoroughly impressed with this film.  The only film I can think of that ""Sixth Sense"" can be compared to is ""The Shining"", and it comes off rather well in that comparison. Haley Osment gives what is probably one of the best child performances I have ever seen.  His character is believable and you can empathize with him quite strongly.  He does a terrific job portraying a bright child with a very traumatic gift. The film is filled with subtleties.  Unless you are fully alert while watching the film, you are bound to miss things, just as in any good mystery.  I know, I did.  It was only in retrospect that the group I was with could recall all the details we had missed at the time.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film is how well it hangs together.  Credit is due to Shyamalan for his excellent writing and directing (the cameo was a bit much). The film takes you into a riveting and almost surreal world.  It makes you question the world around you.  The cinematography and perspective makes the film very real.  I nearly jumped out of my seat several times during the film, and from the jerking throughout the audience, I was far from alone. An excellent and compelling film."

","An odd pastiche that oddly works.  Excluding the terrifying prologue, the movie breaks down into four sections.  The first is a taut psychological thriller.  The second is a well-made, though essentially traditional, horror story with just a bit of gore.  The third makes an odd, and inadequately explained, transformation of the horror story into a rather sentimental and somewhat new-age-ish tale of redemption.  The last is a ""surprise"" ending that should not be a surprise to anyone who has carefully noted (1) certain incongruities in part two and (2) the nature of the transformation in part three.  Even if it is deduced in advance, the ending is very well presented and largely satisfying.<br/><br/>Despite the constant shifts in tone, the movie for the most part carries the viewer along with it.  The production is pure Hollywood, but Hollywood at its best; for example, the scary bits are announced with the same sort of camerawork and sound effects that Hitchcock polished to perfection long ago. The acting is uniformly good.  One surprise is that Bruce Willis can act. His young more-or-less co-star handles a somewhat disconcerting variety of moods and mannerisms remarkably well.

","Unquestionably one of 1999's best films, and a likely Oscar nominee in at least three categories: Screenplay, Supporting Actress (Toni Collette), and Supporting Actor (for young Haley Joel Osment...who is good enough to maybe snag a Best Actor nom). Like Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX, Bruce Willis brings much of his usual baggage (smirkiness and tough-guy detachment) to his role, but fares well enough for the movie to succeed brilliantly. All of the supporting cast--particularly Osment--are nearly perfect and the film as a whole hardly ever strikes a false note. The story is evocative of the best of Victorian and early 20th century supernatural fiction (think Henry James, Oliver Onions, and Algernon Blackwood, for starters), and improves on themes developed earlier by such movies as GHOST, JACOB'S LADDER, and THE SHINING. THE SIXTH SENSE never feels like a collection of cliches, however--it works with the most unsettling and archetypal elements of the ghost story within an understated, non-manipulative framework. The final twist is by no means innovative--it has been a staple of supernatural horror films over the years--but it is still surprising and emotionally satisfying. Kudos to writer/director M. Night Shyamalan (who has a cameo as well) for a film that belongs among the best of Hollywood's horror output."

","I went into this movie knowing nothing about it and I was very surprised. The movie is creepy without being overblown with a lot of special effects. Willis does a fine subdued job as Malcolm Crowe, a successful psychiatrist who has had his career derailed by a patient. And Haley Joel Osment does a fine job as the tormented boy who ""sees dead people."" Somewhere in the movie, there is a beautiful twist that I didn't see coming. I wish they made more movies like this."

","After years of pathetically silly, poorly written and acted horror movies, the summer of 1999 has brought us two classics which will be enjoyed years from now as are The Exorcist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby.<br/><br/>Along with the Blair Witch Project has come The Sixth Sense. In The Sixth Sense the writing, story-line, acting, and photography are superb.  The ending sets new standards of excellence and makes one want to march out of the theater, buy another ticket, and immediately march back in.  When was the last time anyone experienced that in a horror flick?  The scare level was right up there with the best of it's genre and was consistent throughout.<br/><br/>Now lets hope that this summer's horror offerings will prove to be more than mere aberrations (or is that apparitions)."

"nitehawk-8","8","0","0","25 August 1999"," Great acting, but see Blair Witch if you want a scare...
","I recently saw this movie after many of my friends and acquaintances showered it with compliments. Keep in mind that this is after I've already seen Blair Witch, which was incredible (not to mention terrifying).<br/><br/>
The Sixth Sense's shining star (say that 5 times fast) was Haley Joel Osment, who played a leading role as Cole Sear. This young actor is BRILLIANT. It always gets me when certain children can grasp the rules of the stage so easily. I was stunned by his incredible performance as the troubled boy, Cole Sear, who ""sees dead people"" and who is passed off as schizophrenic or delusional. He can trust no psychologist, and his paranoia has many reasons.<br/><br/>An award-winning psychologist, however, slowly wins this boy's trust. Bruce Willis, playing Dr. Malcolm Crowe, actually surprised me in the nature of his performance. Yes, we all know Bruce Willis as the blood-and-grime-streaked action hero-- but in The Sixth Sense, he is uncharacteristically good as this very caring psychologist, who is marred by a terrible tragedy. (I cannot reveal what this is or I'd spoil an important part of the movie.)<br/><br/>Malcolm is so dedicated to his work as a child psychologist that he begins to forget about spending time with his wife, and having a life of his own again. This may seem trite and overdone in most movies, but is a serious problem in real life and is portrayed fairly well here. Cole must convince Malcolm to help him (believing Malcolm is the only one who will be able to rid him of the ghosts) but this forces Dr. Crowe to decide between his work with Cole... or his own family.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan did well with the plot in that it hasn't been done much before, but the movie absolutely did not succeed in being scary (if that was his intent). It was so utterly obvious when something frightening was going to happen, because the music would increase in volume up until the event for somewhere around a whole minute. It wasn't even FUNNY, like in Scream. I do usually like James Newton Howard's scores; ER, The Fugitive and Flatliners are wonderful, but I guess it's not really his fault he had to do some of the things he did in Sixth Sense. <br/><br/>This blatant, failed attempt at suspense totally brought my rating of this movie down, just because it was so overdone. There were a few tear-jerking minutes in the movie, and the ending was actually a little surprising (the ONLY suspenseful part in the movie). There's a big ""yeah, right"" factor in certain parts as well, think about it if you've seen the movie. Overall though, I'd say it was a fairly good movie, especially because of young Mr. Osment. He is destined for great things... I'd rate this movie a 7 out of 10."

","This movie did not scare me as much as I think it had the potential to.  I found it rather slow-going and noticed myself looking at my watch after the first hour, wondering when the fun stuff would begin. Make no mistake, this movie is more story oriented, and it drags out.  That's not to say the movie is lousy.  The acting was decent, the timing right.  The best thing going for this movie, however, is the theme.  If you're into ghost stories and weirdo/psycho kids, then here's an entertaining couple of hours for you.

Folks, the wrong movie has been getting all the hype/buzz.<br/><br/> Seeing the ads you know that a 9 year old boy sees dead people and a child psychologist is brought in to help him.Slowly you begin to discover the truth revolving around everyone.When the boy tells Willis that his secret is he sees dead people you get a bit chilled. When asked how often he replies in a very scared voice""All the time"".That turns your blood to ice.(Almost made me drop some skippy chips).Even though you see what he sees it isn't until he says that do you feel yourself going over the edge.<br/><br/>
 I have to admit that about halfway through the movie I figured out where this was leading to. However I was only half right. Knowing this did NOT diminish the experience.It even pulled me deeper into the film.Every little nuance in the film deserved your attention.It was a kick to see the audience reaction near the end of the film.They were blown away by it.<br/><br/> It would be hard enough to have the visions the 9 year old has even as an adult.Haley John Osment crawls into the child's skin and is utterly fantastic!You believe him.He pulls you along for the very tortured hell ride this child is on.Willis gives an outstanding understated performance as well.He's the decent man that really wants to help the child even when he has doubts about himself.<br/><br/> The writing & directing by M.Night is excellent.He conjures up images you won't soon forget.This gets a very rare 10.

Alas, I was able to predict correctly what the surprise was 5 minutes after the movie's introduction.   I actually enjoyed Sixth Sense more because the dialogues between Willis and Osment, and any scenes w/ Willis in them very much made sense, knowing what's happening/what happened.<br/><br/>Osment was very convincing as a kid who sees what others can't and is terrorized by his special gift. Willis, though low key, showed compassion.<br/><br/>Overall, Sixth Sense has more plot than Blair Witch and its dealing with spirituality gives it more depth than any horror movies in recent years."

'The Sixth Sense' is a painstakingly constructed lesson in how to heighten tension and generate fear.<br/><br/>With none of the high tech special effects of 'The Haunting' and none of the slasher-flick gore of 'Scream' or 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', the movie delivers more edge-of-your-seat nail-biting than all three of those films put together.  What seems like a slow beginning is actually a careful build-up to some very creepy scenes.<br/><br/>As always, the terror of what might might be around the corner is more effective than the monster leaping out of the shadows, but here Shyalaman uses both together with a very subtle approach and an expert timing. There are actually times when we forget we're watching a scary movie, and that's when the film strikes.<br/><br/>The fear is projected off the screen brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment in the role of the psychic child.  As the only one who sees the dead people, he's the only one that can show the fear.  And show it, he does!  The young actor does more to portray true terror than film veterans have done in some projects.<br/><br/>Well worth your money (even at the higher priced deluxe cinemas) and certainly worth your time.  With no excessive blood and guts and only mild language concerns, anyone who likes a good scare can enjoy this film."

","Given that other users have commented on the ending of this film let me make my own personal observation that even without the ""finale"" I would consider this a great piece of film making.  Rare is the film that actually can inspire thought provoking chills days after viewing and even rarer one that also provides moments of legitimate emotional heartbreak and longing.  I can't remember a film in which I have felt both the chill of true terror as well as the tears of sadness through the eyes of the protagonist.  In fact, in some ways this film could even be classified as a great romance and the ending just becomes a wonderful conclusion to an already fascinating film. Highly recommended! 10/10"
"merrywood","9","0","0","23 August 1999"," A rose growing out of the garbage heap.
","THE SIXTH SENSE is one of the few films to explore the true multidimensional nature of humanity in a bright, recondite way.  It does so thoughtfully and with intelligence at every level of the film craft.   Most choices are superb with the possible exception of lighting, perhaps one or two f-stops too far down, in scenes that even on the big screen are difficult to discern.  It is clear why this option was taken but my choice would have been for a subtler approach.  However, the story's theme is classic in that it shows the superior choice of love over fear in dealing with the unknown.<br/><br/>
	That said, the critical factors here are all present: Excellent screenplay, direction and cast.  The denouement is stunning and pulls the entire realization together in a most satisfying and refreshing way.  Accolades for writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, who in the tradition of some directors does a little cameo here.  His future in the industry now appears to be gold.  From my view, he's our latest, much needed, precious gift from India."

","I can't remember ever being so stunningly surprised by a movie.  Glad I listened to the word of mouth and not the reviews.  This one is a 10+ --  an instant classic in the ghost story genre.  I can't think of another ending to a movie that dropped my jaw like this one.  The script is profoundly clever and the direction is masterful.  Young Haley Joel Osment gives the best performance I've ever seen by a child, and deserves serious Oscar consideration -- in the lead actor category!  The movie begins at a slow pace, but that is deliberate and beautifully controlled.  Stay with it and you will be richly rewarded.  See it before you hear too much more about it."

","Everything Blair Watch was not but wanted to be- well written, scary, incredible acting across the board (and I concur with the general concensus, Haley Joel Osment deserve *at least* an Oscar nomination - and not as a token supporting actor, but as a lead.  He carries the film), brilliant direction, and most of all, a plot!  And what a plot it is.  I was totally engrossed in the trauma that this young boy was going through.  I had no idea about the twists the film would take and if you read these critiques it's unfortunate that the fact that there is a twist ending is revealed. You're better off not trying to figure it out, but instead allow yourself to be transported into young Cole's world.  Lighting and color are used wonderfully to set the mood, often changing within a scene.  The music, which can so often ruin a good shock by being more powerful then what's on the screen instead hightened each moment perfectly.<br/><br/>There are some truly scary moments but this is not a horror film.  It's drama with some supernatural elements, so don't be put off by a poor marketing campaign.  As with most twist endings meant to spin everything you've just seen 180 degrees, this one leaves many questions unanswered but if you believe in the world the movie draws you into, these are easily overlooked.  I was unfamiliar with M. Nigh Shyamalan,, but I will certainly be looking forward to his next turn as writer or director (hopefully both again - his singular vision was a huge asset to this film)  Don't miss this flick!"

","*Warning:  My comments may contain spoilers for those who haven't seen ""The Sixth Sense"" yet.<br/><br/>If there has ever been a movie more derivative of another movie (re-makes aside) than ""The Sixth Sense"" is of ""Jacob's Ladder"" I don't know what it is.  I figured out the ""surprise"" ending approximately five minutes into the movie, as will anyone who has seen Adrian Lyne's film.  Once you know what is coming, the ending seems somewhat hastily tacked on.  This is not to say that the film is without entertainment; quite the contrary, actually.<br/><br/>By far the best thing about the film is Haley Joel Osment.  This kid is an excellent actor, and I hope he continues to find work for himself.  He seems to be very natural, and when I got into the movie, I didn't notice that he was acting at all.<br/><br/>I also loved the atmosphere of ""The Sixth Sense"".  It has some genuinely creepy moments with a few good jumps thrown in for good measure.  Every shot seems dark and brooding, perfectly matching the film's content.<br/><br/>I have one major gripe, however.  Maybe I'm strange, but I find it difficult to swallow when a brilliant but unsuccessful and virtually unknown film has its formula copied and ""Hollywoodized"" into a new movie that is enormously successful, but not even close to being as good. ""The Matrix"" did it to the incredible sci-fi noir ""Dark City"", and now ""The Sixth Sense"" is doing it to the vastly superior ""Jacob's Ladder"", and to an even greater extent.  If you want to watch a horror film--and you simply *must* see a movie in the theatre--I would recommend ""The Sixth Sense"", as it is fine entertainment. Otherwise, head down to your local video store and rent the psychological horror masterpiece that is ""Jacob's Ladder""."

Just when nothing else this summer (or year, for that matter) looked like it was going to top Blair Witch as the best movie, along comes Sixth Sense... if you're debating going to see it, just go... it's worth the price of the ticket and will have you walking out of the theater stunned.  Unless a real miracle happens, it may be a long time before another movie is released that has quite the ending as this one.  But believe me... it's not just the ending that will have you completely captivated.  Amazingly, for a Bruce Willis movie, there are probably only two words that would be edited out if this were to be showing on tv.

","It is an unexpected pleasure to report The Sixth Sense delivers solid performances and intelligent chills.<br/><br/>And it's a Bruce Willis movie to boot.<br/><br/>No, that's not an oxymoron. As child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, Willis reminds us not only can he act, but that he's capable of subdued, highly nuanced and genuinely emotive performances.<br/><br/>Written and directed by expatriate Indian M. Night Shyamalan (Praying With Anger [1992]; Wide Awake [1998]; and writer of the upcoming Stuart Little), The Sixth Sense is an old-fashioned, understated supernaturally-themed psychological thriller in the Val Lewton tradition. Recovering from the violent trauma of a home invasion by a former patient, Dr. Crowe is struggling to put his life back together when he takes on a new, literally haunted patient, Cole Sear (the impressive Haley Joel Osment, perhaps best remembered as portraying Forrest Junior in Forrest Gump). Withdrawn and mistrusting, seemingly as a result of his parents' divorce, Cole's fears are not the work of an overactive, disturbed imagination as Crowe surmises, but are tangible. Cole sees dead people, spirits who have failed to realize they are ghosts and whom continually relive their last, painful moments. Since his mother (a strong performance by Toni Collette, from Velvet Goldmine and Emma) and everyone else treats him as a freak, Cole is naturally wary of revealing his secret to Crowe, but the developing relationship leads man and boy into new avenues of self-discovery.<br/><br/>To reveal more of The Sixth Sense's plot would do the film a disservice (beware reviews by critics who are notorious for spoilers such as Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman and Lisa Schwarzbaum). Like Dr. Crowe, audiences should approach this movie with an open mind and be prepared to take a slow, measured journey into the unknown. In fact, the film's thoughtful pace may pose a problem for audiences weaned on MTV-paced quick cutting and big budget flash. However, the preview audience with which I saw the movie was composed in part by families with children, and even the hyper-active six year old seated behind me was enthralled by the story. Not one preteen voice was heard throughout the running time, and both parents and kids looked shaken on leaving the theater.<br/><br/>Acknowledgement should also be made to Tak Fujimoto [The Silence of the Lambs] for his discreet cinematography which, by using a muted palate of dark browns, washed out grays, and natural low level lighting, perfectly captures the melancholy texture of Philadelphia in the fall.<br/><br/>Forget Jan De Bont's folly and the hype surrounding the amateur, home movie boredom of The Blair Witch Project. The Sixth Sense is the kind of chilling film Robert Wise or Jacques Tourneur would have made were they still working today.<br/><br/>Not to be missed.<br/><br/>Philip Nutman"

But the real asset of the film is the eleven year old Haley Osment, who, in the story, has the gift of seeing dead people.  His performance is probably the best child-actor performance I have seen in a decade.  Not even in one instance, did I sense any sort of over acting from him.  He truly deserves an Oscar nomination.  That's probably the least that academy could do for his performance in this film.

This movie is more drama than horror, more heart than blood, and more thinking than scaring.  The acting is effective - nice to see Bruce Willis do something other than wield a gun, and he comes across well in this; and Toni Colette, as the boy's mother, is strong in her performance as a loving, but confused parent.  But the real standout in this piece is Haley Joel Osment as Cole, the little boy - now THIS kid can act!!  My heart was breaking for this poor child for the whole movie . as he struggles with being considered a ""freak"" by everyone around him, so afraid to tell anyone what is really going on.  While there are certainly moments that scare and surprise, I think ""horror"" and ""action"" are really the wrong words to describe this movie.

","I had heard so many positive things about The Sixth Sense that I was sure I was going to be disappointed.  To my surprise the film lived up to all of the hype I had heard.  Haley Joel Osment (Bogus, Forrest Gump) stars as a troubled young child who sees dead people and is constantly haunted by them. Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard) plays the child psychologist who is trying to help him.  The film is so much more than a ghost story its a well-written and subtle approach to what would be a child's worst nightmare. Bruce Willis (an underrated actor) gives a fine subdued performance.  You won't be amazed by what you see, but his low-key approach to his character is exactly the way it should be played.  And young Haley Joel Osment delivers a superb performance on a very difficult role especially at that young age.  I might be going a bit overboard, but hopefully this performance will not be ignored when Oscar time comes around.  Also, Olivia Williams (Rushmore, The Postman) as Willis's wife and Toni Collette (Velvet Goldmine, Muriel's Wedding) as Osment's mother are both great in support.  The big surprise however is a completely unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg (Ransom, Never 2 Big) in a powerful one-scene role.  Highly recommended film."

Some notable things that I found most interesting was the usage of the colour red. I realize white is to life as black is to death but the director utilized the use of red quite a bit in this flick. Is this to symbolize blood? Horror? or a warped sence of dark seduction?  An example of this is when the boy steals the red statue out of the church. There are other ones, why take the red one. Also the red door handle going down to the cellar and the red fort the boy builds in his room. What about the redness of the lips? in one scene, the boy looks like he just finished a huge class of red Kool-Aid, so much that it looks like he has a red mustache, take a look! One last example, although there are many others to mention, is the point where Willis is sitting on the couch and Haley Joel Osment is behind the couch playing with some toys and leaves a red toy truck on the top of the couch, the next scene shows it brown. And yes, for some of you scratching your head, I was sober and not medicated at the time. Is Shyamalan playing with us?..if so, I like it. Go see the film...it is well worth the greenbacks.<br/><br/>*C"

","""The Sixth Sense"" is a well-acted film that provides perhaps the best surprise ending in movie history. It is a horror story that  eschews excessive gore and overdone special effects, and instead relies on pacing, good direction and a solid screenplay in captivating the viewer.<br/><br/>Child actor Haley Joel Ozment and Bruce Willis are superb - Ozment as the tormented 8-year-old who sees ""dead people walking around"" and Willis in a beautifully understated role of the boy's psychologist grappling to help the child while helplessly experiencing the collapse of his own marriage.<br/><br/>The rhythm is sometimes a bit jerky and there are a few minor plot inconsistencies. But the masterful twist at the end makes up for any shortcomings. This is one of those movies that keeps your mind employed long after you've left the theater and gone home. If you think ""The Usual Suspects"" had a good twist, check this film out. You won't be disappointed."

He just isn't too careful with the roles he takes sometimes (Hudson Hawk, anyone?). That, plus this reminded me of that other movie he did about the autistic kid and the government codes and all that fun stuff. Well, this is most definitely NOT that movie! I could not have been more pleasantly surprised by this film. I truly enjoyed everything about it, from the slowly building chills to the Keyser Soze twist of an ending (I never saw it coming!) But I was most pleasantly surprised by the performance of Haley Osment as Cole. This kid was stunning. It is a rare thing to see such an emotionally honest performance from one so young. Two things kept going through my mind as I watched this kid: One, he deserves at least an Academy Award nomination. (yes, he was THAT good!) And two, this kid SHOULD have been Anakin in that earlier summer movie that claimed to be about a phantom. If you're looking for some special effects laden horror movie, go see the Haunting. If you're looking for a few REAL chills, great acting all around and a great story...see this movie!"

I liked the elements of Lars Von Trier's The Kingdom, Jacob's Ladder, and an old Twilight Zone that permeated it.  I liked the shadowy camera effects.

","I won't be giving away anything to say that popularity of ""The Sixth Sense"" relies largely upon it's twist ending.  Don't try to figure out what that twist might be while watching the film - you'll be wrong.  While I can't site specifics of this plot twist, I can reveal that the film makers manage to cover themselves neatly in the larger sense, but where the twist falls apart is in the details.  If ""A"" plus ""B"" equals ""C"" for the bulk of the film, it must also be true when the twist is revealed.  Most folks, however, won't bother with the math and will be happy being told that ""A"" plus ""B"" equals ""whatever we tell you.""  Those who have seen the movie will know what I mean.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film is moodily shot and well-acted.  Arty mood and surreal atmosphere help the film patch plot holes and are more understandable at film's end.  <br/><br/>Scene stealer of the year goes to the tot playing Cole ""Ghost"" Seer.  Willis is fine as the Doc and Toni Colette (now with deluxe bee-stung lips!) ably subdues her Aussie accent to be a Philly single mom.  <br/><br/>About an hour in, however, audience aches for the movie to declare it's intentions and get to the twist.

If it had anything that would earn it an R, it would have ruined the effect.<br/><br/>On to the actual movie.  More than anything, the less you know about this movie the better, and the trailers are particularly unhelpful in this respect by giving away something that you're not supposed to immediately know (They also portray the movie as being horribly cheesy in my opinion, but hopefully in 10 years no one will remember the trailer and will remember the movie). So I won't say anything about the plot, except that I found it engaging, well paced, and well written; though to state it that way is to make it clinical in a way it really doesn't deserve.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and the kid both turned in great performances (Bruce Willis can really act when he has a good character), and Tak Fujimoto's cinematography was perfect. The lighting was perfectly called for, and of a style rarely seen, and the occasional use of a handheld camera was far from being the recent trendy attempts at ""realism"", but instead brought intimacy (something the movie successfully creates as a whole as well).<br/><br/>I ended up walking out of the theater and turning to the person I saw it with and simply saying ""Grand slam."" Why? Because it slammed me with clever fright beats? Or had witty dialog? Or a clever hook? None of these. It simply accomplished everything that it set out to accomplish perfectly, without ever seeming over the top, trying too hard, losing steam, or relying on effects.

Somehow, the movie just didn't maintain an air of tension for me that I think it needed to.  And I blame that, to a degree, on the way it was marketed.

There are some truly unsettling, suspenseful scenes here, all centering around an amazing performance by the movie's 11-year-old star.  <br/><br/>The movie works on so many levels -- and the last five minutes make it effectively two movies, the one that you've been watching and the one that you *weren't* watching, that slipped by under radar.  Definitely one to see twice.<br/><br/>Not just freaky, not just suspenseful, but beautifully crafted and graced with standout performances from Osment and Willis.  The summer's only other successful horror movie, The Blair Witch Project, worked because it took place in a recognizable reality.

That's what makes the film so affecting.  Initially, I was mad that I couldn't figure out exactly what was going on, but I later realized that it was due to some trickery AND some skill on the part of the writer/director.  The film's depth was fully realized by the excellent performances of HJ Osment and Toni Collette, who is outstanding in her role as a struggling single mother.  She is marvelous at playing each of the different situations her character is challenged with, and her facial expressions ring true every time.  The final scene with Lynn and Cole in the car is very touching, as Cole has often said he doesn't want his mother to see him as a freak.  Willis is also good, as is Philadelphia.  Wahlberg is certainly convincing.  It's difficult to discuss the plot without potentially spoiling the film, so my advice would be to just see it.

","First, I am not a fan of Bruce Willis movies (Except for the first Die Hard). People may remember that when Willis did that movie they did not think he would be able to pull it off because they were so used to the character he played in Moonlighting. Well, I'm sure that by now most people will admit that he can handle an action movie with no problem. But keeping in mind that people didn't think he could do it back then, why are people surprised to now see him playing a more intelligent role (ala Moonlighting)?<br/><br/>Willis' portrayal of ""Dr. Malcomb Crowe"" was flawless. With a depth of character rarely seen by ""action movie actors"", Willis manages to be a fully believable ""average guy"" in The Sixth Sense, giving what may be his finest performance to date. Accepting this role may surprise people as much as Mel Gibson playing Hamlet, but he plays the part with no less style or skill than Gibson used in the Shakespearian classic.<br/><br/>Having said that, Willis does NOT put on the best performance in this movie. (Sorry Bruce) Haley Joel Osment, who plays Cole Sear, is astounding. Child Actors do not typically have the experience to play the role of someone as psychologically disturbed as Cole. Not so in this case. Haley makes you believe that he has experienced everything his character has with every tear shed and look of horror on his face. If there was ever an actor who deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar, Osment is in the running.<br/><br/>Some critics claim the movie is slow moving, and in a way it is. At least if you can consider starting a movie with a madman breaking into the house and shooting the leading man in the gut as ""slow moving"". The Sixth Sense is not as fast paced as some movies, but in that is much of the movie's appeal. Since it is less ""in-your-face"" than your typical horror/thriller it has a much better chance to get ""in-your-mind"". And getting in your mind is what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>In an era where horror movies are all about high budget special effects and large gnashing teeth, The Sixth Sense is very subdued. You are lulled into complacency and then brought to the edge without a moments warning, and all with a class and style that lets you know the Hitchcock style of film making is still very much alive.<br/><br/>This movie wraps itself up neatly with a plot twist to make the writers and producers of The Game green with envy. The final scene answers questions you did not even know needed asking. You leave the theater knowing you will never be able to feel the same way about life and death.<br/><br/>If the Blair Witch Project will make you afraid to go into the woods, The Sixth Sense will make you afraid to ever be alone."

I'd only had the trailer to go on to know what to expect, and besides thinking that trailer suffers from the give-too-much-away-itis' that most trailers seem to suffer from these days, I had little clue what to expect.  I'd never seen any of M. Night Shyamalan's work, never saw Toni Collette in anything and only had Rushmore to go on in knowing Olivia Williams, so I can tell you I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw tonight.  Shyamalan has written a corker of a script, stylish and lean, and his direction is truly remarkable.  The pacing may make some impatient gonzos squirm (as it did with the moron behind me who kept muttering back to the screen), but this is no cheap-scare-a-minute wild-cutting frightfest.  Instead, we get a moody, creepy and suspenseful masterwork, with a gripping story and great, great performances from the whole cast.  Toni Collette and Olivia Williams are excellent, but it is Willis and Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.) that are the backbone of this film, and their work is incredible.  Will you be frightened?  Yes.  Are there scary moments?  Yes.  Are there any gross-out ghoulies jumping out at you or outrageous FX to make you realize that this is the scary part and I'm supposed to scream now?'  Most definitely not.  What you do get is a convincing and unnerving film that crawls under your skin and waits for the right moment to grab you.  Shyamalan is a talent to watch out for, and Willis continues to amaze me with his keen eye for odd projects that turn out to be fantastic movies.  Can't wait to see it again.

","Okay...i just got back from seeing this movie, and it was really, really good! A film about a boy who can see dead people, and the psychologist who tries to help him, it held my interest right from the beginning. Bruce Willis actually did a very good job in this movie, as did the rest of the cast. I am sure that anyone who has read a paper has heard about the surprise ending in this film, and don't worry, i am NOT going to give it away, god forbid... but if you don't see this film then you will be missing out  on one of the best endings in a movie since "" The Usual Suspects"". I don't mean that by the content, but just how i totally did not see it coming... anyway, the film was a bit eerie in parts, and although i am not one who scares easily,  it still managed to give me a little bit of the creeps. I highly recommend this film...the actor who played Cole (his name slips my mind) did a great job, as did everyone else... so that's about it! Go see this film!"

","I have been in love with stories of death, horror, and the supernatural since I was 10.  I am now approaching 46.  I have seen a great deal of death and horror, both fictional and real.  Most fiction does not get much out of me, not a shudder, not a chill.<br/><br/>Until I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" (TSS), my favorite ghost story was  ""The Haunting"", the 1963 version.  It was followed by ""Jacob's Ladder"".  ""TSS"" now is in first place.<br/><br/>This story is filled with pain and compassion, kindness and fear, and failure and redemption.  This is a lot to get from a ghost story.  And in the end, it all makes sense.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis as the psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment, as the troubled child have a wonderful chemistry.  You believe they desperately wish to work with each other towards ending the child's torment.  Furthermore, the terror and emotional pain the  child displays is totally believable.  This is what gives this movie the power it possess.  When an emotional foundation is built, one does not require special effects and blood to engage us.<br/><br/>I heard the audience around me gasp at some of the scarier moments. Personally, I had the hair on my arms and the back of my neck raise.  For a jaded cynic like me, this seldom happens.<br/><br/>If you have a weak heart or have religious convictions which would interfere with your enjoyment of a ghost story, do not see this movie.  To everyone else, go see this movie.  Then, after thinking about what you saw, see it again."

","This movie is brilliant, even better than The Usual Suspects and The Matrix... It's one of the few movies I've watched lately and then realized it had no plot holes that I could find. I thought I found one at first, but realized it was merely a case of seeing what I expected to see rather than what was actually shown.<br/><br/>At one point, Cole comments that the ghosts can't see each other, they only see what they want to see. The ending makes the same point TO the audience ABOUT the audience, and does it with a demonstration that cannot be argued against.<br/><br/>The writing, direction, and acting are all great... I knew Willis could act, but I was surprised to see than Donnie Wahlberg (that's right, from the New Kids On The Block) can do some impressive acting, as well--at least in the brief appearance he makes as a former patient.<br/><br/>There's one scene in particular where surprisingly good acting from a child combines with brilliant direction to allow you to see exactly how Cole feels having to go to the bathroom alone in the middle of the night, knowing that the dead will appear, but knowing when or how... I've never seen a movie convey emotion this way before.<br/><br/>You really should see this--not to be scared (which you will be, suddenly and with no warning, at various points in the movie), but to be made to THINK, in the way that good science fiction makes you think."

Once agian, in an attempt to bring in movie goers, they gave away too much of the movie in the previews. Luckily, this movie managed to be great despite this. Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan gets his vision across. Bruce Willis shows he hasn't forgotten how to act in a movie that isn't all one liners and explosions. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, are top rate. The most impressive thing about this movie was Haley Joel Osment. This young actor made me believe he was living with this torment. It is a nice change of pace to see a young actor who isn't just a cute face on the screen. This young man can act, far out classing any one else in the movie. I look forward to more from him.

If the Academy doesn't give Haley Osment at least a nomination for his performance, there is no justice in Hollywood (but then many of us have suspected that for years).<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't seen this film yet, forget everything you think you know.  Forget everything anyone has told you.<br/><br/>I have heard some people complain about the pace of the film.  Well, I suppose for the MTV-addled, or those who think that this is another Bruce Willis ""blow up everything in sight"" movie, they will be unsure what to do with a film that owes more to Hitchcock's sense of timing and build-up than Jan DeBont.<br/><br/>This film does what so few seem to and that is they give their audience credit for having a brain.  There are a million little details and many of them don't appear until after you've seen the film and are discussing it with a friend afterward.  Like the fact that the kid doesn't want his mom to worry about how the kids in school are treating him and so he bribes one of his classmates to pretend to be his friend and pays the other kid off in Pop Tarts.<br/><br/>There are a few points I thought could have been made a little more clearly or more effectively but I didn't say this was a perfect movie, just a great one.<br/><br/>A solid 10."

","Okay, I'm very picky when it comes to the movies.  ""The Mummy"", and ""The Haunting"", and even the ""Blair Witch Project"" were disappointing and, to tell the truth, not worth the money I paid to see them.  But this movie, Sixth Sense, left me speechless and trembling as I stumbled out of the theater.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed was the camera work.  The cameras filmed shots that were unnecessary and unusually dramatic,  successfully giving the film it's dark and eerie feel.  Simply artistic!  The camera work is a great example of how much genius went into this movie.<br/><br/>And the acting!!  Incredible!  Powerful!  I have never seen a better child actor.  He was so believable and so real that he alone makes the movie what it is, taking the audience to depths of fear, despair, anger, and even joy. Bruce Willis also did a great job in a different kind of role then what I'm use to seeing him in.<br/><br/>The movie was so unpredictable, I found myself gaping.  I thought I was in for a reasonably scary horror movie, but it was much more than that.  Though it started slow at first (with excellent character development), toward the end it picked up.  In one moment of the movie, I was uneasy. In another, I actually screamed and jumped out of my seat.  And then in yet another, I was horrified by an Edgar Allen Poetic moment that took me completely by surprise.  And like no other horror movie I've seen, I was moved.  I cried.<br/><br/>And the end... well, you gotta see it.  I was on the edge of my seat, staring and listening in unbelief.<br/><br/>This movie is for the thinking person, the deep person, the person tired of the overblown big budget bummers of the summer. It's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen."

I was especially impressed with Haley Joel Osment, because he is so young, and so believable.<br/><br/>The Good:  The plot is incredible.  To me, The Sixth Sense has one of the best plots.  The writer did a fine job as well as the director.  The plot is so disturbing, original, and twisted.  It's great.  Like I said before, the cinematography is among the best.  The Sixth Sense is jammed with hints and clues as how the movie will end, but most people never realize they're seeing them.  To me, that's what makes a fantastic movie.  Another thing I noticed about this film is that it had great music.  The music played a very large role in the way the overall production looked.  The music is actually what scared me the most.  This movie was good in every way.<br/><br/>The Bad:  I seriously can not find one bad thing about this movie.  There are no holes in the plot and no bad acting.

"RussGrabes","Null","0","0","21 March 2002"," DID COLE KNOW?
","SPOILER<br/><br/>Some reviewers seem to think the movie makes no sense becuase of the relationship between the young boy and Willis's character. If the boy knew Willis was a ghost, then why did he not show the same concern as when he saw other ghosts. If he did not know, then why did he never mention to his mother that he was receiving some sort of ad hoc therapy.<br/><br/>The answer is of course that the boy CAME TO KNOW that Willis was a ghost. The first meeting between the two was in a church - the one place where the boy thought he was safe. If he thought Willis was a ghost, then we would have freaked out to buggery in the church - and he did not.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, the boy is giving Willis advice on how to be happy - ie, talk to your wife while she's asleep. This always seemed like odd advice, and would only make sense if Wilis was ghost. This leads me to believe that the boy came to be aware slowly that Wilis was as ghost.<br/><br/>In the latter part of the film, Wilis advises the boy that the ghosts want help, and the boy tries to help them. The boy becomes aware that Willis has some unresolved issues with his widow, and tries to help him resolve these issues - ie talk to your wife while she's asleep. <br/><br/>Willis and the boy help each other to come to terms with their issues. It's a real, albeit unusual, partnership. Willis really wanted to be able to make up for not solving the problems of the character who killed him very early in the film. In helping the boy, he made up for this short coming, and least in his own mind. Clearly, the boy was able to come to terms with his 6th sense.<br/><br/>Any way, it was a good film, marred only by the fact that alot of people seem to have been able to guess Willis's ghosthood early. But if you're gunna tell a tale like this, and make it have any consistency and honesty at all, then this was always gunna happen. The makers of the movie were quite clever. If you did not guess Willis's ghosthood early in the film, then you've really got to see the film at least twice - or at least that's how I felt."

If not , then there have been quite an AMAZING coincedences that prevented us from finding out the truth before the end: how come osment didn't mention to his mother that he is being treated by a shrink?

The performances by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, while good and passable, weren't as ""outstanding"" as everyone said they were. Really, I thought the best acting in the entire movie was by Toni Collette, who played Osment's mom and did a terrific job. The film itself had some nice atmosphere and a decent score by James Newton Howard (far from his best, though), but that was about it. The ""surprise"" ending is telegraphed right from the opening scene. I knew the moment that scene ended what the ""shock ending"" would be, and I wasn't a bit surprised to see I was correct.

","Seeing this film back in '99 made me a Shyamalan fan for life. For me it features excellent performances from everyone involved, but especially from Bruce Willis(discovering real acting) and Haley Joel Osment ( one of the best actors in Hollywood). The lighting, colouring and beautiful soundtrack give it a creepy yet sensitive tone. But Shyamalan's direction is what above all deserves credit; he gave it a slow, ponderous pacing rarely seen in a time when many mainstream films come across like pop videos (see The Matrix, Charlie's Angels etc.) The screenplay is truly touching, making The Sixth Sense much more than a mere ghost story. .... oh and the twist's pretty good too..."

","This summer cinematic season has been so dismal that I was about to swear off all further moviegoing; but when a very thoughtful and erudite friend mentioned having attended The Sixth Sense and liking it, I resolved to give it a try.<br/><br/>Not usually going out of my way to see horror movies, I went expecting a thoughtful and erudite film, and it DELIVERED.  What is so remarkable about it is not the horror, but the tenderness and compassion permeating it.  I didn't know what to expect.  Yes, it was scary, but for me the chills were nothing compared to the tears.<br/><br/>Haley Osmend's acting, as others have said, is so wonderful that you forget it's acting.  He is a terrified, troubled, miserable child.  But he is more. He is also intelligent, loving, and empathic.  Supposed to be the patient, sometimes, despite his horrible burdens, he becomes the therapist. <br/><br/>
The scene took my breath away when, after Willis has abandoned Cole with regret all around, confessing that he can't be the boy's doctor anymore because he has too many problems of his own, they meet later in the church where Cole hangs out for sanctuary, terrified of being anywhere else. His toy soldiers are lined up on the balcony rail. There is a hard edge in the boy's voice as he taunts the man who had deserted him: which of these trinkets do you want to play, or play with, today?  Then suddenly he looks more closely at Willis's manner, and his own changes to concern for him: ""Something's happened to you, hasn't it?""  Such dimensions of sensitivity save both of the characters in the story, and  propel their film beyond horror to greatness.<br/><br/>I did not find the ending as surprising as some did, but it was very satisfying.  If the opening scene had been in a library, panning in on a newspaper and then on a story recounting the award given to the good doctor, or an article written by him, an even more intriguing level of Jamesian conundrum might have been evoked.<br/><br/>But I still don't get the bit about the wine cellar which he could never unlock.  Anyone who understands this is invited to e-mail me with an explanation.  As the guy said in ""Back to the Future,"" my density has brought us together.<br/><br/>Maybe a second viewing will clarify.  I'm definitely going back.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing again.  Do not culturally deprive yourself. Go!"

","My faith in the movie industry is slowly being restored. After years of seeing more bad then good films released that insult the intelligence of the audience I was almost ready to give up. In the last two weeks I have seen two fine well written, well acted and well directed films. The latest is the Sixth Sense. This is what moviemaking is all about. How do you scare the crap out of people without using cheap shock gimmicks? See this movie and you'll find out. This was also done in the original movie The Haunting. If you've seen the new Haunting then you know the difference. This movie has the spirit of some of the best Twilight Zones and is also why after so many years that TV show is still a classic. I think Rod Serling would have loved this film. All I can say is thank you to all involved in the making of The Sixth Sense! You have succeeded in creating a film that will stick in the minds of many for years to come!"

","I can´t say that I´m an absolute Bruce Willis fan. In fact, I find his roles before this film one-dimensional: many explosions, uncounted bullets flying around and an ever-winning, untouchable hero .... boring. However, this time I´ve been surprised. He did a great job, it´s just, the kid was even better. I´d say, you love this film or hate it; it´s hard to stay unimpressed (in good or in bad). The finale is not entirely predictable, so it leaves you taste of something unfinished, and yet .... Plot is depressing, but the end...... fabulous. I´d like to see more such roles from Bruce Willis. He´s got the stuff to become a first class character actor; if he lets action aside. From my point of view, highest recommendations. It´s even better the second time!"
"ken_vandenbussche","Null","0","0","10 February 2002"," Shyamalan's sixth sense!
","Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan (who was born in India and whose real name is Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan begins his career with the making of two minor films: Praying with Anger (1992) and Wide Awake (1998). In spite of its seemingly low-quality structure, these two films have a certain rank of importance, as they were to announce Shyamalan's third film: ""The sixth sense"". Considerably, this new film has had some influence from its predecessors. Unlike the first two films, ""The sixth sense"" becomes an instant hit all around the world AND Shyamalan's breakthrough in the film industry. But the success of this film is not just because of the appearance of famous actor Bruce Willis; who was given a leading role. There is so much more going on.<br/><br/>For example, the directing of the film. Shyamalan uses the same, remarkable technique Hitchcock came up with 50 years ago. They both manage to let the camera create the sinister atmosphere ... which is of such importance in a thriller. The cinematography of this extraordinary film is absolutely perfect. Although Hitchcock may be a more impressive director, Shyamalan's camera positioning is still quite exceptional.<br/><br/>Besides the directing of Shyamalan, ""The sixth sense"" also provides beautiful acting performances. Bruce Willis gives his best performance ever. His acting has improved by the years. Toni Collette may not be a well-known actress, but her performance as the mother of this special kid is touching. But the greatest acting comes from the smallest actor. At the age of 11, Haley Joel Osment stuns the world with what appears to be one of the greatest performances ever by a kid.<br/><br/>But a good film is more than a great director and great actors. It also implies an original story and that is exactly what ""The sixth sense"" is all about. Notice also how Shyamalan uses spiritual elements in his films. This film and the one before ('Wide Awake': a story in which a child is searching for God after his grandfather died) were both mystical and religious.<br/><br/>""The sixth sense"" is, without doubt, an exceptional thriller and his next film 'Unbreakable' is to prove to the world that he can do it all over again; that it wasn't just beginner's luck."
"kirbysta","10","0","0","29 January 2002"," In one word: Remarkable.
","10/10!!!!<br/><br/>Through the double doors and past the crowds of teenagers on a Friday Night I was trembling.  I had just finished seeing `The Sixth Sense' for the first time.  This movie, this genius work of cinema, had shaken my `senses' and opened my eyes into a new world of films.<br/><br/>Brainwashed by cheesy action and sci-fi films, I had never seen such a melancholy but in some way joyous movie such as this.  Everything was perfect.  The creepy morbid sounds of the violins in the opening credits made me feel as though some life force was creeping behind my chair.  The brilliant story line, dialogue and acting as well as cinematography and original score made this film into a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story line was amazing.  This little boy Cole (Haley Joel Osment), an outcast, was tormented by something bizarre and out of this world.  Only one person can help him, a child therapist Dr. Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis). <br/><br/>
The dialogue and acting couldn't have been better.  My favorite scene is where Osment and Willis are playing a game so that Willis can get to know Osment better.  Willis pretends to read Osment's mind so he will step forward towards a chair.  `You've never been in any real trouble,' says Willis.  Osment takes a step back.  `We had to draw a picture, anything we wanted,' says Osment.  `I drew a man, getting hurt in the neck by another man with a screw driver.'  Willis shocked replies `did you see that on TV Cole?'  `They had a meeting, mama started crying, I don't draw like that any more,' replies Osment.  `How do you draw,' questions Willis.  `Kids playing, dogs running, rainbows.'  `They don't have meetings about rainbows,' replies Osment.  Just the fact that a kid of that age could deliver dialogue like that with such power made me realize how wonderful the acting and dialogue was in this film.  Toni Collette also gave an outstanding performance as a Philadelphia mother.  I was shocked to hear her English accent when she was at the Oscars because she was so believable as Cole's mother. <br/><br/>
To be frank I think this is one of the best movies ever made.  The two things that really got to me were Haley Joel Osment's acting and the original score composed by James Newton Howard.  Many people have argued that the movie relies on its ending to make it a good movie.  I was pulled into the movie from the very beginning and I would still have a strong feeling about this movie even if it didn't have such a shocking ending.<br/><br/>I am happy that a psychological thriller was nominated for best picture at the Oscars and that Haley Joel Osment was nominated for best supporting actor.  Most people thought that American Beauty was a better movie but even though I liked American Beauty, I thought `The Sixth Sense' was a better movie.  If you haven't seen this film you must!"

(Sorry, couldn't resist.)<br/><br/>There is always a sense of place in his films. We see a world that is not Hollywood, nor New York. This is a place he has been, and knows intimately. A rare and wonderful thing in itself. <br/><br/>The film's pace is deliberate, a Shyamalan hallmark. He lets the story tell itself, at its own pace and in its own style. <br/><br/>Rare and wonderful are terms that come to mind, over and again, with each of his films."

","Depending upon when you get IT, THE SIXTH SENSE is either: o Somber, episodic and only infrequently scary, or o Gripping, suspenseful, frightening, and surprisingly touching.<br/><br/>I think it is the latter. It's also beautifully written, directed and acted.<br/><br/>
Because it is so unconventional (More Hitchcock than Spielberg), and uses cinematic elements (lighting, sound, editing) rather than special effects to provide its horror, it is not surprising THE SIXTH SENSE crept into theaters.  What IS surprising is its excellent box office so early in its release cycle.  This once again demonstrates a literate, entertaining film CAN find an audience in these days of megabuck special effects extravaganzas.<br/><br/>THE SIX SENSE is the best suspense film since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."

","I don't care what anyone says, this film is NOT a horror!! It's a thriller, and it lends itself more to the psychological and supernatural than anything else!<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment's line - ""I see dead People"" will go down in history with lines such as ""I'll be back"" and ""You talkin' to me?"". This line also sums up the film.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's big screen debut is tense, scary, and very clever -perhaps a little bit too clever?!!<br/><br/>With Osment, the casting couldn't have been better. With Willis, you feel he has finally found a director who knows what he is truly capable of. They both give great performance's in this film.<br/><br/>******PLOT SPOILERS******<br/><br/>When I first saw this film I was scared witless. I also knew there was a twist. My mates said, that I could either figure it out in the first 5 minutes, or I'd have to wait until the climax. Well, when I went in I totally forgot about the twist and settled into the film's unique pace. When the twist came........my God I was crying my eyes out!!!! It was sooo heartbreaking!!!! That one line from Olivia Williams ""Why did you leave me?"" was perfectly delivered and as Bruce's character Dr. Crowe realises the shocking truth, so do we, and we are left reeling!!!!<br/><br/>But, when you really think about it, or watch it for a second time, you begin to see the major plot holes. So he's been dead this whole time? Does he eat? Does he do his shopping? has he not spoken to ANYONE since he's been dead? Why has he noticed his blood stained shirt NOW? there are a lot of questions one could ask that could destroy the whole film. But, I don't hold that against it, for the simple reason that the director has constructed a tight paced film, with a few genuine shocks, and no matter how weak the twist seems after we dissect it, it's still a good one, and I still cry!!! That's a sign of good acting, good manipulation, and a great score.<br/><br/>This is a film that is intelligent and knows what it wants to be. The director is also known now for his surprise shock ending's (Unbreakable anyone). If he can keep throwing us off the scent, AND show us the truth at the same time, then that is a good sign that this director knows what he's doing.<br/><br/>Thumbs up for 9/10<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","Like a fool i was suckered by all the hyp surrounding this movie when it was released,but the reality was very different.

[Was that a Spoiler?] The plot can be summed up thus ""psychologist investigates disturbed kid who sees ghosts"" and once you know that, all you have to look forward to is the much vaunted ENDING. Suffice to say i saw the twist 20 minutes before it came and for friends this varied between 10 and 30 minutes! As usual Willis is so wooden i mistook him for a piece of furniture and although Osment is good for his age,this is no reason to shell out hard earned money to watch this drivel.

","SPOILERS It's a good enough movie, but the alleged cleverness of the ""twist"" has been blown out of proportion.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether or not you correctly predicted that Bruce Willis' character was a ghost (I did early on), when you think about it, the twist doesn't mean much. Never is a particularly great deal made of why nobody notices Bruce Willis' presence. Never does the fact that he is shot early in the film have any strong effect on his relationship with Cole. This jumble of clues is never presented as a mystery to be solved, and thus, the little paradigm shift in the last minute doesn't really solve anything, and feels tacked on. No wonder why some people didn't see it coming - because the story's structure never even proposed that such a revelation was at all necessary. At least in ""The Usual Suspects"", the final twist actually answered a question that was posed throughout the entire film. At least in ""Fight Club"", the revelation near the end gave the movie its meaning.<br/><br/>Okay, so Dr. Crowe's a dead guy.

This movie was excellent; it's almost a straight faced version of ""The Frightners."" Both Willis and Osment do wonderful jobs high-lighted by Shyamalan's directions. The ghosts themselves deserve an A-plus for the atmosphere they imbue, but realisticly, sixth sense perception is not that exclusive. Ghosts are not that invisible or that tangible. Some people do have greater sensitivity to them, but on a whole, ghosts can be seen by just about everyone whether they are psychic or not. The only other plot point I see unresolved is while Willis discovers the truth about himself, did Osment know it all along ? Otherwise, this is great movie for believers and unbelievers."

"XRANDY","Null","0","0","4 November 2001"," A dark, yet intelligent mise en scene.
","SPOILERS!!! (Though if you don't know the deal with this one you've been living in a cave)<br/><br/>
Director M. Night Shyamalan knows what scares us.  He knows that fear lies in our imagination and that imagination is strongest during childhood. That's why he uses a child to explain to us that the chills we sometimes get and items we misplace have an ominous explanation.  He understands why we are scared as we sit around the campfire listening to a good ghost story. He knows that though we may have become more cynical and sure in the world as we grow older, we maintain enough eidetic comprehension to think that there just might be ghosts.<br/><br/>
Shyamalan also knows how to scare us.  He brings verisimilitude to the project by playing on our personal fears.  He makes us recall the long walk down a dark hallway to the bathroom when we were children after waking up and having to urinate.  He makes us remember the dilemma of trying to hold it versus stirring in the darkness of our room and feeling our way to the door.  By using a situation familiar to all and reprising our childhood bogeymen, the discomfort becomes intimate.<br/><br/>
That's why this movie works from both the over the top foreboding, such as the disturbed Vincent muttering, `Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone? I do.' to the sine qua non subtleties that are handled with empressment.  Most notable among the latter is a crafty moment when the father of the poisoned girl watches in horror as the cause of her demise is revealed on video.  In the background we see the folded hands of an unknown viewer that nervously pull apart and tug at the clothing near the throat. What a recherché touch!<br/><br/>
Shyamalan seems to have the knack for knowing when to show us something and when not to so.  Not revealing who opened all the drawers and cabinets, leaving the inmate in the attic unseen, and having Cole glance quickly away from a passing graveyard while on the bus add a numinous appeal.  Yet he astutely uses visual shocks to keep us on edge and remind us to be scared in a film that is so easy to admire for its visual beauty and detail: angry ghosts quickly stalk by, hanging bodies materialize, ghastly apparitions appear at car windows, all adding up to a mélange of the supernatural incarnate.<br/><br/>
He treats the terrestrial characters with equal flair.  He is particularly adept at using body language to make a point as when we witness the hand of Cole's mother drop exasperated on the dinner table in an expression of anger that is far more emotive than revealing her face. Another satisfying moment is the humorous `jewelry sale' scene where the couple's faces, enclosed in a tight shot, make the most of human countenance, unfortunately leaving the incisive dialogue an afterthought. And while these brilliant physical nuances ingratiate our subconscious the work's efficacy may actually lie in the tour de force of timing and perspective as is demonstrated in the trenchant `step game' tableau.  In this scene camera shots break from Cole's footsteps (back and forth) to a commensurate movement to and from Malcom's face.  A simple idea? Yes.  A powerful image? Yes!<br/><br/>
Of course many movies can produce scary moments, but the few that do maintain the pace in engaging the audience via character development.  It's become hard to commiserate with the quotidian teenage victims in slasher-flicks, but vis-à-vis the dramatis personae assembled here our empathy is easier to reach.  Our cynicism is ablated and we care about these people.  We understand the special nature of the already-established relationship between Cole and his mother, evinced nicely by the `what did you do today' colloquy in which her fanciful exaggeration is juxtaposed with his sad dreams of just being accepted by his peers.  Conversely we also appreciate the glimpse into the developing friendship of Malcom and Cole as their emerging trust is shown as the former's confession of marital neurasthenia melds with the latter's sub rosa revelation, `I see dead people.'<br/><br/>
Oh and to all those who claim that they could see the ending coming: give it up, we all know better."

This isn't a mindless action flick, is it?""<br/><br/>Well, nothing could be further from that.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who has recently recovered from an attack by a patient he failed to treat.  Needless to say, this leaves him unsure about his skills, but his encounter with Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osmont) gives him a chance to jump-start his career.<br/><br/>After a period of time trying to get on Cole's good side, Cole reveals his secret to Malcolm: he sees dead people.  (Duh.)  This changes their relationship dramatically...the patient is now the psychiatrist, treating the recently dead by completing their unfinished business, with help from Dr. Crowe.<br/><br/>The final scene is one of the most impressive twists ever shown in a film, ranking right up there with the Statue of Liberty at the end of Planet of the Apes.  I'm not going to tell you the twist, but you might have guessed it by then.

","A wonderful horror/suspense film that transcends the genre. How often does a movie come out that takes a long-established and even cliched genre and turn it on its ear? I can think of only a few in the last two decades, including ""Pulp Fiction"" which changed how we look at crime films and ""Die Hard"" which did the same for action films. Well, ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of these rare movies, and it will change how you look at ghost stories forever. (And, interestingly enough, Bruce Willis is in all three of these films! Weird, huh?) I won't reveal much of the plot here, since the less you know about the film going in, the better. But I will say that it involves ghosts; the film has a clearly defined idea of what a ghost is, exactly, and that idea is crucial to the plot of the film... which involves the relationship between a child psychologist (Willis) and a little boy who has a very big problem. ""The Sixth Sense"" is slowly and deliberately paced (though never boring), is filled with both heart-breaking moments and knowing humor, reveals plot through character development and subtle directing instead of through heavy-handed manipulation of the audience like most horror films, and manages to horrify without dumb ""shock""-moments and a minimum of gore. The acting by everyone here is uniformly superb, especially by Haley Joel Osment, a child-actor who plays the main character and who is dead-on perfect in scene after scene after scene. The quiet moments between him and an equally superb Bruce Willis are beautifully written, funny, sad, quirky and original. And the movie builds to an incredible ending that will leave your head spinning, guaranteed. A true classic."

Don't get me wrong it is really well done and even if you do figure it out, like myself (do I win a prize?), you may well forget it throughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Malcolm Crow.

","Good production values, subtle visual effects and underplayed acting (particularly from Willis) go to illustrate an unusual approach to the ghost-story genre, though the ending screams predictability - couldn't believe so many people were fooled by this (see THE CRYING GAME if you like unexpected plot twists!). A plethora of inconsistencies gives the game away almost from the outset. Nearly as much of a letdown as JACOB'S LADDER.<br/><br/>The film is over-rated as a result, deserving as it did its lack of Oscar success, though it did lead to a semi-revival of the 'spook' picture (e.g. the superior STIR OF ECHOES, THE HAUNTING), for which we should, for the most part, be grateful.<br/><br/>For the most effective treatment of the genre, fans of the supernatural should instead try and catch THE WOMAN IN BLACK, now available on DVD."

"movieman_bg","Null","0","0","9 September 2001"," Amazing in every sense
","I admit that ""American Beauty"" deserved the Oscar for Best movie of 1999, but I also have to admit that this movie came in a pretty close second place(all due respect to Michael Caine, but ""The Cider House Rules"" was not up to the competition). ""The Sixth Sense"" was almost perfect in every way- starting with the brilliant plot, the chills, the suspense, the acting, the directing, the editing, need I go on? This movie became a classic as soon as it hit the big screen- and in the same year ""Fight Club"" and ""The Matrix"" came out. Admit it- anything that becomes competition to those two movies has to be at least brilliant.<br/><br/>First off, there are very few movies which leave you as breathless as this one. And it's not only the ending, but the whole thing- starting with the open cupboards in the kitchen and topping it off with that ""realization""(don't worry, i'm not going to spoil it for you, but if you haven't seen this one- rush to the video store!). Speaking of spoiling, this is one of the few movies where you can have the shocking finale and still enjoy the movie more than once. Why? Well, simply because it's a multi-layer, highly developed story which becomes better every time you see it. Mr. Shyamalan achieves cinematography that equals the mastery of Hitchcock and the eye of Orson Welles(although Syamalan doesn't live up to these standards in his later ""Unbreakable"").Anyway you look at it, the camera is moving and you are following every small motion with a sparkling mind and an enticed eye. Very few directors can control you like that.<br/><br/>Mentioning ""The Sixth Sense"", there is no way you can't credit young Mr. Osment. That kid has the skill that some ""A"" class Hollywood actors lack(let's hope he doesn't end up like ""wonder boy"" Culkin). Haley Joel Osment is not afraid of the camera and creates an unforgettable character full of fear, need of protection, and most of all- innocence. There is no way you can hate that kid(unlike young Mr.Vader in episode one), you feel compassion for the character and you can put yourself in his place. That's again something very few people can create.<br/><br/>There is another person in this movie that deserves immense credit as well. No, it's not Bruce Willis, but rather Ms. Toni Collette. The Australian actress proved she was up to Anjelina Jolie's competition, but the Academy wasn't very keen on giving her the Oscar. Collette creates the image of a truly caring mother, the type of person Susan Sarandon portrays in ""Lorenzo's Oil"". She begins as a stereotype, but proves to be more than a face in the crowd(quite like Judy Dench in ""Shakespeare in Love"")and leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.<br/><br/>There is much more to be said, but it would take a rather long time and I would hate to be boring. In conclusion, ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of those movies that take a part of you for two hours and return a completely different thing. You walk out of the theater and you think: ""What people am I seeing?""Living, my friend, living, but they seem so different now..."

","The Sixth Sense! What to start with? This movie is certainly one of the supreme masterpieces of all time. This movie tells us the story of a psychologist Dr. Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is still trying to put behind him a case of a patient he was unable to help, and with whom he had a very weird encounter a year before the main story takes place. Dr. Crowe is now handed a new case of a kid named Cole Sear which is said to have serious problems, not only at home, but also at school, and with his friends, which call him a big time freak. Cole's family background is not the best his father left and he is emotionally blocked by this, his mother is constantly depressed when confronted to her son's regular problems as well as stressed by keeping her two jobs at the same time. As soon as Crowe starts knowing Cole better, he realizes that he his no ordinary child, he has so much more depth that he could ever imagine, also Cole states that he has encounters and that he is surrounded by dead people. Dead people, How? `They are walking around like regular people, they don't know they're dead () Please make them leave.  I'm working on it.' Powerful and emotional dialogues like this one are abundant throughout the entire film as well as huge tension. If you're in for a good horror/ thriller movie, this one is for you. 7 out of 10"

","I'm one of those ""unfortunate beings"" who viewed the movie in video a year after its release when its reputation was still strong among movie goers.<br/><br/>My philosophy is that a good movie can be enjoyed and appreciated wether it's seen on the big or the small screen.<br/><br/>Before handing out the bad notes, I'll give it the credit it deserves for certain aspects. First, both the photography and camera work are superb. Haley Joel Osment plays very well (his talent was confirmed in the recently released ""AI""). Willis is also good but, IMO, he didn't seem to fit well in that part of a child psychologist. I'll blame it on the amount of action movies he played in.<br/><br/>The plot is undeniably the strongest element of the movie, it is quite effective (although, I think, it would've made a deeper impact on me if I had experienced it in book form). And most of the technical aspects like lighting, editing and even the soundtrack deserve good marks.<br/><br/>So, what's wrong with The Sixth Sense??<br/><br/>All through the movie, I had the feeling (not sense!) that I was in a Stephen King movie. And ya know: this story of a little kid who sees ghosts that died tragically (but no one ever sees them) and his worried mother wants to help him get through this psychological problem... Doesn't it remind you of another horror movie by the late great Stanley Kubrick??<br/><br/>Well I found that annoying. And that's not the only thing.<br/><br/>As I wrote above, the plot may be brilliant but its ""well oiled"" logic is somewhat flawed.<br/><br/>[WARNING: IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET, THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS MAY ACT AS SPOILERS!] Not shouting, just warning.<br/><br/>1. If I was in a house where my husband or my wife had been murdered before my very eyes, I wouldn't stay in that place for long. I'd quickly put the house for sale, pack up my things and leave! Move on to another place, as far as possible. Wouldn't you?? So why is Anna still holed up in that house six months after Malcolm's death??<br/><br/>(Oh yeah, it serves the interest of the story. She has to have a last minute encounter with the ghost of her husband so they can bid farewell to each other.)<br/><br/>2. In the story where the little girl is gradually poisoned by her evil stepmother: it's amazing to see how a small child can effectively hide and position the videocam that records the evidence that will later incriminate the murderess. Everything is recorded at the right angle (the girl probably asked her mother to stand on a piece of tape on the floor while she prepared the tainted potion!!) with the prime suspect never ever suspecting anything (she also never cleaned up her daughter's bedroom or if she did, her clever daughter would already have hidden the camera under the covers!!)<br/><br/>If you were guilty of murdering your own daughter, would you go ahead and wear a vivid red dress at her funeral while everbody dressed in darker or somber clothing?? (Ah! But the color red serves a purpose here! It's evidence, cleverly planted by Mr. Night Shyamalan himself to cue us in to important things!!) Yeah, sure. Please don't give me that crap that ""people with a guilty conscience betray themselves in such manners"".<br/><br/>If you're ready to believe that, you're ready for anything. Including the fact that it took Crowe six months and the help of a psychic kid to realize that he was only the ghost of himself. (It took Patrick Swayze less than six minutes in Ghost, I guess Willis must be getting old and a little slow!;-)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll stop here. I guess the reason why I didn't enjoy this movie, as much as the majority of people, is because I was distracted and annoyed by all these details.<br/><br/>I know some people saw the movie 5 times and even more. I saw it once and it's enough for me.<br/><br/>Hope I didn't offend anyone."

Haley Joel Osment is great in the film and really made me care about him, the always underrated Bruce Willis gives an equally good but much different peformance.

"moondoggy88","Null","0","0","25 August 2001"," Great thriller movie
","I saw the Sixth Sense in a small theater with my friend, and was very surprised at what I saw. This film taught me that a scary movie doesn't have to be gory and extremely violent to be scary. Frankly, I believe that The Sixth Sense is scarier than many other horror films with killers. Haley Joel Osment's performance as Cole was amazing for a child actor, and Bruce Willis' role was also fantastic. I love scary movies, and this particular one comes down as one of the best I've seen. Everything about it is unique and dramatic; the acting, script, and atmosphere were all perfect for the movie's subject.<br/><br/>Another aspect of this film that makes it enjoyable is the clues it gives throughout the movie. I love thrillers like this that give various hints about the movie throughout to see if you can figure out the outcome of the next event. The director did a great job of giving out hints that caught the viewer's eye (most of them I didn't catch when I saw it at the theater, but when I rented it and watched it again I could spot some). Many twists are also spread in the movie that lead to the ending (which was a shock, even though I kind of guessed it half way through).<br/><br/>Before I saw this movie, I had heard of it and thought it would freak me out. However, it didn't really. Instead, it amazed me. I never imagined that such a genuine film like this could be made. A few moments of the movie did startle me, however, which made it a little more fun. I like this movie more than other horror films because, instead of a gut-wrenching movie to scare and shock you, this one just moves through you, and makes you take into consideration the feelings of the characters instead of watching them all die one by one.<br/><br/>Another addition to the movie that makes it genuine is the music. I don't know who composed it, but it was terrific. It came in at the most appropriate and dramatic parts of the movie, where it was needed most. This movie would have been about 30% less scarier if the music wasn't so good.<br/><br/>I suggest for anyone to see this film (if they can take some slight shocks). It will amaze you a lot more than scare you. It is simply the best thriller movie I have ever seen, because it concentrates on the feelings of the characters instead of blood and guts."

Night Shayamalan's decision to take this story in a manner which is totally the antithesis of today's horror films--i.e., no extraneous blood and guts or nudity--and build a spooky atmosphere.  The connection between the psychologist (Bruce Willis) and the young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who sees visions of dead people is one of the more honest adult-to-child connections I've ever seen outside of a Steven Spielberg film.  And no matter what anyone else says, the first time I saw this film, I did not see the twist ending coming, nor did a lot of other people either their first time around.  That coda is perhaps the best sting-in-the-tail ending since the original PLANET OF THE APES; and somehow, I have the feeling that Rod Serling, no slouch with sting-in-the-tail endings he (see ""The Twilight Zone"" and APES), would have been proud of Shayamalan for it.<br/><br/>Elements of CARRIE, THE SHINING, and POLTERGEIST, three great horror films all, are present in THE SIXTH SENSE--and yet, this doesn't feel too terribly derivative.  I'd put this movie very close to the aforementioned three movies in the horror film pantheon because of its deeply penetrating story and its psychological scares, which were all honestly earned.  In summary, THE SIXTH SENSE is a winner."

","Wow! What an ending. I don't think I've been this moved by a film's conclusion since the frighteningly shocking end of David Fincher's ""Seven."" Don't worry because I will obviously not ruin this film for anyone, but suffice it to say that the end of this film allows you to see the entire picture from an entirely different point of view the second time around, and that is simply a unique achievement. In fact, I was more than willing to see this film many more times, just so that I could see it unravel within that other realm. Another thing that stood out for me with this picture was the fact that unlike its trailer, which sells this film as a chilling thriller, this movie is actually more of a supernatural drama with plenty of tear-jerking scenes to boot. And yes, I crumbled under the emotional drainage of the film's players, especially with Toni Collette in a few choice scenes. I would rather compare it to elements of ""The Omen"" and ""Ghost,"" rather than any thrill-seekers ride, though it has it's share of creepy, terrifying moments.<br/><br/>In fact, the film is deliberately paced very slowly, with plenty of time given to the performers to grapple with the powerful material at hand. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent job as the confused young child who is going through things that no child should ever go through, and even Bruce Willis pulls off an impressive steady performance, without a single ""yipee-kaya"" in the whole script. But once again, allow me reiterate how much the twist ending of this film allowed it to catapult onto another level. Even after the film's credits had long been done rolling, I could not help but discuss the many different parts of the plot that were altered through this amazing ending, and could not help but further my appreciation for this film. Great acting, great style, great score, an instant classic ending, and certainly worthy of being called one of my favorite films. And despite it not being an all-out thriller, believe me when I say that you will be startled in a few scenes, and certainly touched in others. Giant kudos go out to the writer/director of this film, M. Night Shyamalan, for pulling off a very impressive film presentation.<br/><br/>By the way, if this film interests you in the least, make sure that you see it before someone ruins the ending for you, because it truly is one to digest firsthand.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"

","Haley Joel Osment should be nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, and not in the ""Supporting"" category either.  He carried this film on his little shoulders, and was amazingly effective.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis was also amazing.  Tender and sweet, a complete turnaround from his trademark smart-ass.  I would imagine that being the father of three in ""real life"" gave him some insight to this role; I don't know that we would have seen this from him ten years ago.<br/><br/>In a supporting role, Toni Collette was also terrific.  Donnie Wahlberg is unrecognizable as the mixed-up grown-up former patient in his underwear with a gun (don't ask).<br/><br/>And yes, the ending, the ending, the ending.  It changes everything you've seen before, and actually makes a good movie better by adding a layer you didn't even know was there.  A lot of the dialogue was a tad pedestrian, but the writer/director deserves a lot of credit for sticking to his vision. Sometimes it is about artistry after all, even when making a ""horror"" movie."

","Before my wife and I saw this movie, she read a review that mentioned a 'surprise ending.' She said, ""I'll bet it's like the Goosebumps story I read to the kids."" She gave me the plot line of that story, we watched the movie, and of course, as the plot was lifted from the story, the movie held no surprises for us. That's not to say it isn't a good movie. I really did enjoy it, and Bruce Willis does a terrific job. But without that surprise... Really, once you've seen the movie and know the ending, how likely are you to watch it again?"

First off, how can Bruce Willis go through a whole year without realising his wife has spoken to him in that time? Secondly, how did Bruce Willis know about Cole? Where did he get the notes on Cole from? Another dead shrink maybe. Lastly, if the spirits of the dead remained on Earth to help people, then what about the poor dead buggers in the school. Who can they help? Well, I guess the imagination can invent it's own answers.<br/><br/>
Apart from that, this film is more logical than most horrors. The directing is good, the soundtrack (borrowed from the Shining of course) is superb and three main character give off fine performances. I give it 7/10"

This role was difficult and also, he's a kid.  Kids aren't supposed to deliver this kind of an electrifying performance.  And even if you don't want your spine to tingle with chills, and even if you don't want to see Bruce Willis in one of his best roles ever, and even if you don't want to see it because this kind of movie doesn't turn your button, I highly recommend just going to see it for Haley Osement.  I promise you'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a wonderful journey into the supernatural, brilliantly acted, with a great story and plot twists that will make you think about it for a long time after.  James Newton Howard's musical score should also be up for a nomination.

"sddavis63","8","0","0","29 June 2001"," Definitely Watch This At Least Twice
","I find this a very difficult movie to review, because everything in it is so tied to the surprise ending that to say anything at all about the story is virtually to give everything away. Believe me, though, that you have to watch this twice to really appreciate it. The first time I watched it I found certain elements of the story to be so confusing that they were distracting. I also noticed a number of plot inconsistencies that bothered me. In the light of the movie's ending, most of it makes sense (although a few plot inconsistencies are actually created by the ending.) In any event, I found ""the Sixth Sense"" to be far more enjoyable the second time than the first. Without giving the whole thing away, what can I say about this?<br/><br/>The performances are very strong. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist seeking to help young Cole Sear with his visions of dead people. Sear, of course, was played by Haley Joel Osment. Osment put on an astonishingly good performance, and was well deserving of the Oscar he won as Best Supporting Actor. Also offering a strong performance in a supporting role was Toni Collette, who played Cole's mother Lynn, struggling to make sense of Cole's behaviour. <br/><br/>On the down side, I found much of the dialogue in the movie was offered in rather hushed tones which sometimes made it difficult to follow what was happening. That, however, is a relatively minor criticism. I would rate this movie as an 8/10 without any hesitation at all."

","One told me the brilliant ending and I guess this was what ruined the movie for me at first sight. It was good but not as brilliant as everyone said. But I wasn't sure about my opinion on this film. It needed at least one more view. And now I recognized the craft that is behind this movie. Brilliant timing, brilliant story, brilliant acting. And it was only now that this film really scared me. And it gets more with every viewing. Ten more times and I will end up with a heart attack.<br/><br/>This film doesn't need any gore. In fact you see only a glimpse of what Cole has to suffer his whole life, hour for hour. And believe me, it's enough. M. Night Shyamalan takes about an hour to introduce the characters to us. And he does it very effective and carefully. We learn about Cole's fears. A nine year old child, spending his whole life hiding from ghosts, not able to overcome his fear to tell anyone. We learn about Cole's mom who is tired of not knowing why her son shudders, why he is haggard at times. We learn about Dr. Crowe's troubles to create a equalization between his private- and working life after getting shot by a former patient whom he couldn't help. The reason why he wants to help Cole so badly. This takes about a third of the film. But isn't boring a minute. Who isn't touched by the way Tony Collete and Haley Joel Osmont share a scene is definitely in the wrong film and should go see any Dolph Lundgren film of his choice.<br/><br/>It's amazing how well this film does in every aspect of filmmaking that even this is scary. Everything, the script, the cinematography, the sound, the music, the directing, the acting. It all builds a whole. A brilliant one.<br/><br/>A classic up there with Braveheart."

"Delerium","Null","0","0","8 August 1999"," ""Not Every Gift Is A Blessing"". How true.
","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" is a neat little thriller that borderlines drama and a plain, old-fashioned ghost story. It is chilling and effective at certain times, puzzling in others.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a renown child psychologist who, after an encounter with an ex-patient who he couldn't help, is left mentally scarred and finds the world around him falling apart. He takes on a quiet and alienated young boy named Cole, whom he tries to succeed in reaching him where others have failed. Young Cole is branded a freak by his schoolmates, and everyone believes that his sense of isolation and paranoia is self-imposed, and brought on by his parent's divorce. Willis treats his case in much the same manner at first, but when he admits the truth to him, things start getting really weird. Apparently Cole is gifted in ways few would imagine, he has the ability to see and talk to the spirits dead people. And it is not just the recently dead, he can see deaths that took place many years before. In one scene, his teacher is quizing him on the history of the school, and he casually mentions ""They used to hang people here"", drawing many puzzled stares from his classmates. When the subtitle on the poster says ""Not Every Gift Is A Blessing"", they mean just that, this turns Cole into a nervous wreck, and he becomes increasingly paranoid as the film progresses. All he knows is that the ghosts won't leave him alone, and they want something from him. Willis soon becomes a believer, and he tries to help him in whatever way he can, while putting on the back burner everything else, including the relationship with his wife.<br/><br/>I wouldn't dare give away the ending, except to say that it defies all logic. It will leave you asking many questions as you think back to instances earlier in the movie. For the casual moviegoer, it will give you a lot to talk about after the movie is over.<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" is flawless in terms of acting. Bruce Willis is very watchable, as always, and he turns in the caring, big-brotherly performance he failed to give in last year's mediocre ""Mercury Rising"". I have always liked Bruce Willis in whatever he did, even if everything else about the movie was bad. It is a good role for him. Young Haley Joel Osment is superb as Cole, and he plays with a perfect sense of timing and depth. He is incredibly believable in his role, and he has turned in what could quite possibly be the best performance from a child actor I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie. It has the perfect mix of supernatural thriller and drama, with more emphasis on the chemistry between Willis and Osment rather than distracting the audience with special effects for two hours. It is not a prefect movie, but it makes for one of the summer's most satisfying moviegoing experiences. 8/10"
"Nosajes","9","0","0","1 August 1999"," thrilling
","Far better than any Bruce Willis movie that isn't directed by Gilliam or Tarantino has any right to be!!  He actually is pretty good in it too!  An ode to such great 70's thrillers as Roeg's Don't Look Now and Friedkin's The Exorcist, this film is moody, disturbing and visually fascinating.  Using all forms of symbolism, including arches, frames within frames (and sometimes frames within frames within frames), spirals, shapes, Dutch angles, cinema verite and deep reds, Tak Fujimoto proves once again why he is one of the most respected and sought after DP's in Hollywood.  Toni Colette, I love you!!!  I forgive you for Cosi!!  She shines in this film. She could have gone for the whiny over the top single mom but instead she walks that fine wire between realism and a typical Hollywood stereotype. Fantastic! If she decides to stay in Hollywood I hope she continues to find great scripts and roles she can make her own.  I have decided that Haley Joel Osment is one of those Webster people who only look 10 but are really 60 because no child should be able to emote so well!  Lucas, watch this and realize what you could have had! Jake Lloyd, watch this film 40 times and go back to acting school!  Mark Whalberg. Wow!  I didn't have a clue that it was him until I was reminded in the closing credits that he was even in it. I knew he could act before but he brings intensity to this performance that stays with you throughout the film's duration. Well done.  If I have one complaint it is that I felt the jumps and make-up effects were unnecessary. We have seen a child throw up green pee soup before, we don't need to see it again.  But it doesn't break the mood.  Proof that Hollywood can punch out eerie and smart films when they want to. {If you like this one, and even if you don't, check out Roeg's Don't Look Now!!  Maybe it will inspire you as well.  Or at least make it harder to fall asleep!}"

"RueMorgue","9","0","0","8 May 2001"," Amazing film, with a truly amazing ending.
","To be honest, given some of the work that Bruce Willis has done in the past, I wasn't at all interested in seeing this film after watching the various trailers.  In fact, I wasn't even one of the people in line at the video store the first Tuesday it was available.  Even more surprising, I didn't see this movie until it was available on video for almost two months!  It wasn't until many friends told me I absolutely had to see it that I caved in and rented it.  Seeing this film again just last week brought back a lot of memories with the second viewing, and I felt that I should add my two cents (six cents?) into the mix here.<br/><br/>This film has one of the best story lines of any film released in 1999. Perhaps the best thing about it is that it isn't a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  It maintains a series of highs and lows, and then works up into a crescendo for the surprise ending.  You will think you have it figured out up until the last 15 minutes or so, and then what you expected to happen doesn't, and the experience becomes something else entirely.  I thought I had this film pegged... many of my friends had told me to be ready for the surprise ending... and my mouth hit the floor when it became painfully obvious what this movie was all about.<br/><br/>Having related what I thought about the story, I'll move on to the acting and more technical aspects of this film.  First off, let me say that Bruce Willis simply shines in this movie.  As the grounding force in this film, he does an excellent job, perhaps not seen since his work in Twelve Monkeys or Pulp Fiction, in my humble opinion.  Usually known for his work in action films, he reminds us here yet again that he can be just as good in more dramatic and complex roles.<br/><br/>The award for ""stealing the show"" in this film must go to Haley Joel Osment, who had not done much of anything notable up until being cast in this film. I'm surprised that nobody else has used the talent this little guy has to its fullest potential.  This is probably the movie that will be known as the one that made his career.  Recently he turned down the opportunity to appear in the sequel to this film, and rightfully so.  I doubt if he could repeat the performance he turned out in this film, that's how excellent his acting was the first time around.  In all, I'm sure he made the correct decision, and has chosen to go on to bigger and better things, if that's possible.  At any rate, his facial expressions and simple innocence add credibility to the story in ways you cannot imagine.  He's unable to cope with the supernatural events in his life, until being helped through them by Willis, who plays his role as a child psychologist almost to the letter.<br/><br/>Toni Collette is superb in her role as Cole's (Osment's) mother.  I had never seen Collette in anything before this, and I was very impressed.  It always amazes me how a director/casting agent can take a cast of (almost) unknowns and put them together in a film where they click and create a movie that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.  In a role where she plays a woman who is nothing if not extremely pained by the problems her son deals with on a daily basis, problems which he refuses to talk to her about, she does a beautiful job.  She is a very beautiful lady, and I can't wait to see her in more dramatic roles.<br/><br/>While not generally scary, there are some slightly gory scenes, and some which create a feeling of terror deep within the pit of your stomach.  Of course, the use of the musical score within the film adds to the tension.  I felt as though I was watching something I shouldn't be at some points in the film, and I'm sure you can relate, or will be able to when you finally see it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, go rent it.  Make sure you watch it on a Friday or Saturday night, and late.  This will give you enough time to digest the film over the rest of the weekend, before heading back into the week on Monday.  If possible, watch it Friday night and again on Saturday night, just to pick up on what you may have missed.  After watching it once, knowing the ending will help you make note of a lot more the second time around.<br/><br/>Watch for director M. Night Shyamalan in a cameo role as Dr. Hill, who examines Cole after his experience at the birthday party.  I must admit, I didn't see him the first time around.<br/><br/>My rating:  10/10."

Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" has a ridiculous premise, if you stop to think about it -- but when you saw the blackbirds gathering on the jungle gym, I'm sure you felt fear and foreboding.  Well, I won't give you the laundry list, but ""The Sixth Sense"" has its story faults as well.<br/><br/>But that doesn't change the fact that this is a brilliant film.

Please... DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM!! The movie was superbly acted by both Willis and Osment (Cole). The plot had great potential, but the story flow was flawed. The characters were inconsistent both before and after Dr. Crowe's getting shot: Crowe gets an award from the Mayor for his work with emotionally disturbed youths, and he wants to hang the award ""in the bathroom."" (Duh!) OK, OK, he was drunk from celebrating, but c'mon! Crowe was a professional. The vulgar side of his character was inappropriate at best. (""Cheese d---""???) He gets shot by a patient he failed, and his wife never calls 911! Instead of running to the phone, she runs to him looking for blood. After finding it, she just lies there with him, crying. Not realistic. The mother of the dead girl near the end wears a RED dress(?!)  to the funeral? (This was supposed to be a hint to us that she had a brush with the next world.) It was a blind and no-brainer hint. NONE of the uses of red were clear enough for us see that hinting was even going on! BUT... believe it or not, I am going to close with both my thumbs UP.

","My big problem with this film is the ending. No, not *that* ending (everybody knows this is a film with a twist, though I certainly mean to respect the tradition of not revealing it for the sake of first-time viewers).  It's the gooey, feelgood sentimentality of it.  What possessed Shyamalan, who's written a literate, well-paced, thoughtful and heartfelt screenplay, to tack on this gloopy, over-optimistic, neatly resolved conclusion for the young hero Cole? Very disappointing. I also think it was a bad mistake to cut the originally-shot final scene (available as an extra on DVD and at least one VHS release), which rounds out all the sequences we see on video - left feeling rather redundant in the final cut - and provides a more emotionally complex ending.  Maybe one day he'll see the error of his ways (and the studio will see an opportunity for more big bucks) and issue a revised Director's Cut restoring his superior first thoughts.<br/><br/>Those are the reservations, which I put first because this film was praised rather beyond its real merits by a somewhat hysterical community of reviewers delighted to find signs of intelligent life in blockbuster film-making. Make no mistake, this IS an intelligent, finely-crafted, almost fully satisfying film, developing a premise that has to be one of the best ideas in modern cinema.  (There are some minor slips in consistency, however much the film makers may pretend otherwise.) Its biggest attractions are the beautiful cinematography, and Haley Joel Osment in the difficult central role; he's a real actor, a bit of a prodigy really, and gives a strikingly mature performance.  Bruce Willis rightly plays second fiddle."

","At the risk of sounding corny, the Sixth Sense is one of the spookiest movies I have seen for a long time. It aren't disembodied, knife wielding teenage slashers that scare me - Scream (1,2,3), I Know What You Did Last Summer (1,2), or even Michael Myers or Jason or Freddy back in the day left me cold. The Sixth Sense succeeds, because it mainly (not exclusively) uses eerieness, isolation and a bone deep sense of loneliness as it's main tools. Also, it asks: how do we really know we're alive? The acting is first rate, from Toni Colette as Cole's mom and Haley Joel Osment as Cole, the acting is very natural, believable. There's not a bad performance in it. Also, Donnie Wahlberg was totally unrecognizable.<br/><br/>The plot twist at the end, is made even more intrigueing, because it makes you doubt who else, other than Willis, is in the same position. Cole? Cole's mom? However, this doesn't work because of inconsistencies throughout the movie, which is a pity, as the movie would have been even scarier because of it (I hope this is cryptic enough)."

"Zim-10","Null","0","0","8 August 1999"," Bottom Line: Excellent
","This movie was quite entertaining, and there are two main ideas that make this summer blockbuster a masterpiece. 1) Director M. Night Shyamalan knew just what to do with this movie (considering he wrote it) to make the audience really WANT to see it a second time.  The ingenious surprise ending will make viewers want to come back and watch the movie again with the knowledge of the ending. Shyamalan's choice of camera angles is subtle, with a slight reminder of the angled view of Mission: Impossible.  He also used James Newton Howard's eerie yet inviting score to entrance the viewers.  Shyamalan uses his directorial touches to make this movie a true work of art. 2) Haley Joel Osment delivers the most powerful performance I've seen out of a young actor in a good long while.  He is reminiscent of Justin Henry of Kramer v. Kramer.  His natural naivety makes the audience really tune into his character.  (After seeing this movie, I'll bet George Lucas kicked himself.)I'm sure the Academy will recognize the hard work of such a bright young star.  He has quite a future ahead of him. The Sixth Sense is a movie that I've been planning to see since I saw the very first preview.  I practically counted each day until opening night, and I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to be at the premiere in my own home town! This is a movie I definitely plan to see multiple times."

","***************************SPOILERS************************************* IF YOU ARE READING THIS TO DESCIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO SEE THE MOVIE AND HAVE SOMEHOW NOT HEARD SPOILER DETAILS ALREADY THEN READ NO FURTHER. THIS MOVIE IS DESTROYED FAR MORE THAN MOST BY SUCH INFORMATION AND IT IS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW.<br/><br/>All talk was about this movie by the movie watchers and anyone else who had ssen it and there is alot to talk about, it is possibly one of the best first-time experiences, but repeated viewings I believe really wear it thin.<br/><br/>I will never know if I could have predicted the ending because it was destroyed for me weeks before I used the cinema entrance. The movie is definitely not run of the mill, more than standard quality but it is clear to see plot faults and severe borrowings in it.<br/><br/>Have you ever thought about the idea of a modern day ghost walking around and not realising they were dead, what if Patrick Swayze had gone on longer after he had pursued the bad guy not realising he was dead, or the idea of a person being able to see them like Woopi Goldberg could hear them, how freaked out would you be growing up with that. These are some pretty good ""the drive home after the movies"" discussions. How could Bruce Willis have gone on after the first night without realising it. Think about the living complications we all experience every day, things we take for granted. Where was he when his body was taken away in an ambulance, or better still at the funeral. And his employers, when they heard about his death how would he have got the file he was reading when he first saw the kid, he must have been issued it.<br/><br/>They light-speeded over the ""they only see what they want to"" didn't they, so if he moves around objects that dont really exist or are'nt really moving like the pen and paper as he was analysing the kid, or the tape recorder, where does the line get drawn, it was an extremely general statement, and if nobody else can see or here the ghosts then how the hell did he get a tape recording of the voice of the guy who didn't want to die, it was a great emotional and shock device but a major implausability in actual screenwriting. The second time I saw this at the movies a few of the holes surfaced to my vision, the third, on video they were as clear as daylight, and the fourth has certified me.<br/><br/>And Cole spent half an hour talking to absolutely nobody while his mother was a dozen feet away in another room, why exactly would she say ""you've got 5 minutes"" to Cole, we were meant to assume at the time that she was talking to Bruce but when the ending comes it just falsifies that part. And when Bruce Willis threw that rock at the jewelry store window, everybody stared, in ghost they had fun with that sort of thing but with the conjured up spirit world in this it once again is a major glitch for it. How could they have seen something that was not there.<br/><br/>I actually think the director thought the movie was too dull at final cut and shot the new ending for interests sake, so it is either bad writing or bad editing.<br/><br/>Production Values 2/2, Acting 2/2, Screenplay 0.5/2, Quality and Meaning 0.5/2, Originality, 1.5/2<br/><br/>

"renaldo and clara","Null","0","0","11 March 2001"," M.Night Shyamalan is a genius.
","I've never  seen <Cider House Rules>, but I already know that Michael Cane didn't deserve Haley Joel Osment's Oscar...oh, well, the Academy probably felt bad for him or whatever because this was his first...<br/><br/>  Anyway, although Haley Joel Osment is absolutely amazing in this film, I'd like to say that it's really the writer/director who represented his character who deserves the *real* credit. I say this because I wasn't in a rush to see Osment's next film, <Pay It Forward>.<br/><br/>  I'm not into long, drawn-out movies, and I can definitely say this one is drawn out. But drawn-out movies that happen to be great ALWAYS work even better the second time around. Seeing it for the second time made me smile more, cry(twice!), and even get scared more easily. I'm sure it's already been mentioned here, but the ""ghost"" scenes are hauntingly real-looking, as opposed to a film loaded with CGI where I could imagine myself admiring the physical attributes of a  ghost rather than being terrified by it. The fact that children are used makes it freaky as well.<br/><br/>*********SLIGHT   SPOILER   ***************<br/><br/>
I love how after Osment's character gives the video to the deceased girl's father, how 1) what was on that video was completely unexpected and spine-chilling and 2)how the boy leaves without getting involved. He figures he did something he needed to do and that was that, feeling more and more as though this was his destiny.<br/><br/>
*********END          SPOILER!***********<br/><br/>
I also think it is great how Shyamalan made Osment's character a real little boy. This is refreshing; he is neither one of those smart-ass brat kids who always seem to be used to steal the spotlight from their on-screen parents, nor the pole opposite, a  mentally-handicapped, loud and obnoxious kid who are used for cheap comic relief, with extremely bad acting skills and stage presence. While the above norms for child characters run rampant in Hollywood scripts, not so in Shyam.'s.  For example I liked <American Beauty> a lot, but hated Janie's character for its type-cast 'spoiled teen angst-driven'ness..(Why did she have to wear black *and* feel spiritually ""black"" as well? Overkill...not realistic, believe me, I'm 21 and I know teens don't act this rude to their parents for no reason) I also liked <Traffic> but didn't understand why they had to make the daughter's character such a stupid, snotty bitch, the way she spoke to her parents, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
       But Haley's refreshing, *and* he manages to steal the show from Bruce. Bruce's acting was good here, one part I especially liked, but not for the same reason everyone else did was the part where  he tells Bruce that................<br/><br/>
*************SPOILER!   SPOILER!   SPOILER!******************<br/><br/><br/><br/>
..............he sees dead people. The first time you're watching it of course you won't realize......but the second time....watch how when Malcolm asks the boy about the ghosts, and the boy answers ""They don't know they're dead, they only see what they wanna see"", watch Malcolm's eyes as these lines are said. From knowing that he was dead all along, it's amazing to look back and see that his eyes are that of a ghost whose eyes are glazed over in disbelief because he ""only sees what"" he ""wants to see"".<br/><br/>
*************END       SPOILER  *********************<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Another thing I find brilliant about Shyamalan's script is that he twists the story one way to lead you to believe it is going in one direction, then BAM!, we are pleasantly twisted in an entirely different direction. For example, the tape Malcolm plays of his old student makes you believe he discovered something that will ultimately end the movie, but no.............!<br/><br/>
     This is one of the most psychologically scary movies I've ever seen, and it also works one of the most heart-warming dramas ever because every character is given a respective role in the film, and in turn every character is sympathetic and good to each other. It also has a pleasant ending for a girl who would've gotten about a zillion nightmares from this film had it stayed scary throughout!<br/><br/>

","The film came in with a hype that, in the first glance, made me cautious. But, after reading some trusted critics I decided to go on despite the hype. Well, it paid off.  And something more.  It was an experience that had little to do with my previous experience - and notice that I have watched a lot of movies the last 20 years.  A brilliant script, supported by excellent performances by all the leading actors, a atmospheric, intelligent direction, great cinematography - everything was in tact. And it worked out in the best possible way. Actually it is hard to tell something new in the thriller genre.  All the subjects - ghosts, serial killers, vampires, zombies and all the other horror-concepts - have been overfilmed so much, that only a film in a decade makes it to immortality. In my humble opinion, for the nineties the place is taken.  By the sixth sense. Plus a few words about the actors:  Bruce Willis carries his difficult - esoteristic and emotional in the same time - part with the ease of a great actor.  His second great performance after ""12 monkeys"".  Even if he stands in the shadow of little H.J.Osmont, you can recognize great acting. Haley Joel Osmont is quite a change - pleasant - after all those underaged ""I know everything I look so cool I am an adult in a child's body"" so called ""movie stars"".  Congrats go to the director, who managed to take the best out of the kid. Pretty impressive was also Tony Collete as the kids mother. As a bottom line, to be honest, this film is worth every second you spend on watching it."

That is probably the greatest thing about the film: it is one that you can come back to, and appreciate just as much as the time before because of it's original concept. Haley Joel Osment will never give a better performance as he did in this film, despite his remarkably young age. The film by writer/director M. Night Shyamalan simply would not have worked if it wasn't for Osment's stunning performance. Bruce Willis, one of Hollywood's greatest actors gave a breathtaking performance, yet was still acted off the screen by the promising young actor. In gloomy Philadelphia, Shyamalan manages to bring across the fear and sheer horror that the film suggests with seamless ease and realism. He is sure to become one of the best Hollywood actors of his time if he continues to produce films as moving and technically brilliant as this. It should not be classified into a specific genre of film, but should be recognised as a film that combines the horror and the thriller genres to perfect effect.

","The Sixth Sense is a good thriller. It is superbly acted by Osmen, and Willus(in a different role) is good as the psychologist who tries to help the child. But Osmen is really good as the disturbed boy. I think he's probably the best young young actor to come along sinse Miko Hughes in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. But Osmen's performance was probably more realistic than Hughes'(but both of them make that kid in S.W. Episode 1, look pretty dull).<br/><br/>This film, being shot in philadelphia(my home town of course:-) was beautifully shot. It was kind of funny when in the beginning of the film, when it mentions an exact part of the city, and it looked quite different than what most philadelphians are used to(my dad knew it though). It was neat trying to find out and recognizing the places the film took place in and around.<br/><br/>Anyway It is a good film, some slow spots, but its taught, well acted, and has some nice shocks toward the end.<br/><br/>Oh and to the guy who said that ""people  who are easily entertained"" will like this film.

"llihilloh","Null","0","0","11 December 2000"," I see an interesting plot with a very poor script.
","Why? Why? Please tell me why people enjoy long, boring movies that must have a high budget in order for it to be good. Also, I've noticed that all of the films with the ""hottest"" celebrities in it, are garbage. The Sixth Sense is proof. <br/><br/>I waited until the movie came out on video to see it, so that I could try to understand the movie at my own pace. The nonstop showing of the ""I see dead people"" trailer forced me to watch it. I waited and waited for that part in the movie where Haley Joel Osment's character finally confesses that he in fact, does see dead people. The part came and went and I was left sitting there thinking, ""that was what all of the hype was about?""<br/><br/>
This film could have been a success (in my opinion) if they would have rewritten most of the movie and eliminated Bruce Willis's character. One of the reasons this film was so popular was because the part of Malcolm Crowe was played by the always talented and big-named Bruce Willis. His part in the making of this was about as useless as the huge budget it had. (I'll talk about that later.) Whenever a movie is released with a big time actor, it's safe to say that the movie will become a hit. Haley Joel Osment was terrific, so why not pair him up with a lesser-known actor. Don't get me wrong, Willis is truly talented, but anybody could have played that role and it wouldn't have made a difference. <br/><br/>The characters and actors were good with the exception of....Bruce. Osment shined in his role as Cole Sear. His talent was the only good think about this film. I was very impressed with him, and I think that it would have been hard to find any other young boy to play that part the way he did. For the role he was given, Willis did a fine job as usual. Not a lot of effort was put into it though. A little more could have come from the psychologist's part.<br/><br/>Lets talk about the budget. Considering that it was $55 million plus, I would have liked to have seen a little more effects. Nothing ruins a movie more than an overload of special effects. Worse, when they're not even necessary. This movie didn't even come close to having enough. I'm trying to think where exactly in the movie were these heavy duty illusions, and I can't remember. Anyway, that amount of money put into a movie where it could've just as easily been made without any ghostly effects, was a ridiculous waste of money.<br/><br/>The plot and intentions of this film were good, but it was down right boring. I was on the verge of falling asleep, but I was so anxious to find out what happened at the end, so I forced myself to stay awake. I read the summary of the film, and it sounded really good. Maybe it was the long scenes that were stretched to the limit so that they could build the story up to the climax. Or, maybe it was the pointless and unnecessary writing that was included in this ludicrous script. Either way, I thought that it was one of the most overrated and silliest films I have ever seen. Once again, the movie might have had a chance if it cut down on the way too long scenes between Malcolm and Cole. <br/><br/>~*spoiler~*<br/><br/>What am I leaving out? The ending! The ending was quite a shock, but it left a ton of questions unanswered. We discover that Malcolm is a ghost, but there are too many problems for this to be semi-realistic. It would have been a lot easier for Cole to realize that he's such a whiz with ghostly activities, and think just what if my friend, Mr. Crowe is also a ghost? A little far fetched and I'm getting off track, but the ending that should have been a major high point to the story, was ruined by its lack of creativity and was a total disappointment. <br/><br/>Everybody loved this movie for reasons that are beyond me. From now on I think that I'm going to stick with low budget movies and simple plots. And that also have some interesting and exciting parts in it. ""I see dead people"" was one of the dumbest lines ever created, but it was made into a masterpiece. I have no idea why."
"Pzippity","10","0","0","7 December 2000"," Multilayered Masterpiece (*SPOILER*)
","Probably the best crafted movie since the great Hitchcock left the scene, though I might argue it is superior even to the master in that respect. Haley Joel gives what has to be the best performance ever by a child actor, maybe even for an actor period, and Bruce Willis is a great enough actor to get himself out of the way enough to allow the boy's brilliance to show through.  There is one aspect of this movie, however, that I have yet to see anyone comment on and which to me makes this movie an even more remarkable achievement.  In Buddhism (OK, I admit it, I'm a Buddhist, a monk even), the mind is considered to be the sixth sense, along with the usual five.  When viewed from this perspective, how Dr. Crowe creates his own reality in his mind, it becomes quite a different film experience.  Obviously many of those who have commented on or reviewed this film have no idea of what ghosts really are, i.e., minds that cannot accept the reality of their own demise and remain trapped on the physical plane until they are released (in this case by an act of restitution for perceived past failures).  And no, Dr. Crowe doesn't really interact with anyone other than the boy, not if you really pay attention.  He just appears to (red herrings).  Also I want to add that Tak Fujimoto is a marvelous cinematographer.  I've never seen a movie where I was so totally grabbed from the very first frame, the bare light bulb slowly turning on.  Ditto for the music."

","As of the time I am writing this the average rating for Sixth Sense puts it at #28 on the database. I believe anyone who gave this any higher rating than 7 must have only seen it once. This film cheats you into believing something, and at the end you are left with a revelation of sorts that keeps you thinking for hours after you've seen it. I wondered to myself for hours exactly how I had been fooled into thinking Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Crowe was really alive throughout the film. The next day I decided to see it again, and this time I realized how so many people had been fooled into this ""revelation."" There are a couple scenes that deliberatley set the tone for Dr. Crowe's daily life in between meeting w/the kid. When he is ""late"" for his anniversary dinner with his wife, we see Dr. Crowe make eye contact with her, she appears to look up at him angrily, sigh loudly and then walk out of the restaurant. In another scene when Dr. Crowe comes over to the kid's house, his mother appears to be knowingly setting up a meeting between the two. She says something to the nature of ""it's only a 30 minute session."" My point is that although this was a beautifully crafted film, just about anything involving Tak Fujimoto will be, there is a major flaw in the deliberate attempt to misguide the audience. If you have only seen this film once, watch it again for this reason, just try to pick out the times Dr. Crowe is made out to be a normal functioning person. The big ""suprise"" end will be coming from a mile away the second time. Most great films get better with continued viewing, but this one just gets stale. Overall I give it a 7.5/10."

","Bruce Willis is in one of his most mature roles of his career as Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  M.Night Shyamalan shows some promise as one of the first great horror filmmakers of the 21th Century.  It came around the same time as the Blair Witch Project(1999) and in my opinion is a better film.  Its more effective at utilizing the psychological aspects of implicit and suggestive horror.  This was the second film that Bruce Willis played a doctor who suffers a traumatic experience at the start of the film(the other feature was The Color of Night{1994}).  Haley Joel Osment gives the most convincing performance of a young kid since Heather O'Rourke talked to the TV people in Poltergeist(1982).  The Sixth Sense is like a puzzle box that needs to be viewed more then once.  The color red plays a major importance in the roles of the ghosts.  Olivia Williams is lovely as the sad Mrs. Crowe.  The Sixth Sense(1999) has the most surprising ending that I've have seen since the unmasking of the mysterious villain in The Usual Suspects(1995)."
"Mort-31","6","0","0","30 October 2000"," I like that - but ...
","It is very difficult to write a good review about ""The Sixth Sense"" without letting out the ending. To those who haven't seen the film yet: The whole film would be meaningless with any other ending. It was made only because of the ending. Every single scene, every shot exists for no other reason than to give a hint or to prepare the very last scene. The consequence of this is that the film seems very artificial to me; it couldn't be more constructed. Shyamalan shows us exactly as many scenes as possible. Other scenes we expect we do not see because they would tell us too much about the solution.<br/><br/>I admit I'm fond of these stories where at the end you sit there with an open mouth, speechless and then you think about the film again and again and you find answers to thousands of questions you didn't ask. My favourite film is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it has the most brilliant point since ""The Planet of the Apes"". But there they didn't need any talking dead people to tell a gripping story.<br/><br/>I mean, this was a nice little movie with an interesting atmosphere, some exceptional actors (I don't mean Willis, I mean Osment and Collette) and a little bit of black humour.

This film is proof when you have a good script, good actors and a great director horror films can be scary, insightful, and moving. I like how Malcom asks Cole what he thinks the ghosts want. So many ghost movies have ignored this question. Why would ghosts go to all that trouble to make themselves visible? We never explore their point of view until now. Bruce Willis gives the best perfomance of his carear. He makes Malcom a flawed human being who is beggining to experience failure for the first time. But the film belongs to Harvey Joel. His role requires actual acting, not being cute for the camera. If we don't feel sympathy for Cole then the whole film wouldn't work. Osmand more then holds his own. He gives alot of his performance in a hushed whisper. This shows he is utterly terrified of a gift he dosen't understand. The ending is one of the most shocking and unexpected I have ever seen.

","It was a super hot monday afternoon when my best friend and I curled up on her couch and watched ""The Sixth Sense"" on her computer DVD. I had wanted to see this movie because I adore Bruce Willis and I wanted to see how he performed in this movie. I am an actress, and like watching how other actors (and actresses) handle their rolls and lines. I walked away from this movie wanting to be a film director. Why? Because it was the director who made this film incredible! Now, don't get me wrong! Haley Joel Osment was OUTSTANDING!! I want to see him in more lead rolls more often! A kid with that much talent should be around more! Bruce was AWESOME, as always! But the director should win an award. The red factor... notice the red things in lots of scenes? (the boy has on a red sweater at the party,the red anti-depressant pills, and so on...) Also, the way everything is set up so Bruce doesn't have to move or do anything in public.... and the ending! Well, I had known the ending when I watched this movie, but still, it was incredible!!.. I am in love with this movie, in love I am!!"

","The Sixth Sense is among the most well-crafted stories of our time. I loved the director's style and approach not only with the camera, but with the way the camera helps tell the story. I'd like to think that if American Beauty had not been made this film would have snagged the Oscar.<br/><br/>
Of course, the best part of Sixth Sense is the ending, which I hope stays a secret forever. Public revealing of the ending would be worse than genocide, in my opinion. The movie is great the second time around, especially when you're with newcomers, because it's SO obvious to you and you can't believe they don't get it. What an amazing feeling it is when you finally get the ending, it's indescribable. Better than ""Rosebud,"" better than ""Luke, I am your father,"" better than Keyser Soze. You get my drift."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","0","9 September 2000"," The meaning of supernatural thriller is completely re-written by M. Night Shyamalan with the stunningly encompassing Sixth Sense.
","M. Night Shyamalan returns to directing for his second effort after the disappointing Wide Awake, which he directed for release in 1998. His second film, The Sixth Sense, was a staggering success that rocketed Shyamalan to the very top of the filmmaking world. Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who takes on the excessively challenging task of helping young Cole Sear (played with amazing skill by Haley Joel Osment), a boy who is cursed with the ability to see dead people. <br/><br/>Complicating the plot is the fact that Malcolm once had a young boy as a patient with the same problem, and he was unable to help him, and he is now afraid that the same thing will happen with Cole. <br/><br/>Every individual scene in The Sixth Sense is saturated with cinematic trickery, giving even the liveliest settings, a birthday party for example, a strikingly eerie feel. Because of that, even though the film is not non-stop relentless thrills and scares, it never lets the audience relax, which is one of the main things that make it such a good movie. Besides that, not only does the film avoid excessive gore and tasteless violence, it also provides the perfect premise for presenting the small amount of gore that it does contain. Cole is able to see people who are dead, and naturally he sees them as they look when they died. This provides for some seriously scary moments, such as when he is using the bathroom in the middle of the night and the woman walks by the doorway. Very simple, but coupled with the startling sound effects at that moment, this is one of the scariest scenes seen in movies in recent years.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense had a incredibly imaginative and original story, and it was presented with great skill. It has a certain quality that very few movies of this type have. Most movies try to keep the audience guessing (Wild Things), but in The Sixth Sense, the audience doesn't even know that something is amiss. Before the breathtaking plot twist, the ending is not even considered as a possibility. However, once the ending is realized, a number of questions begin to arise. (spoiler) How could Malcolm have lived for so long as a dead person without noticing anything strange? Wouldn't it seem strange to him that no one was able to see him since that one night when he got shot by his former patient? He couldn't possibly interact with anyone in the world of the living. And even if he could, why didn't his fiancee acknowledge him at the restaurant? I mean, assuming that he doesn't know he's dead. Questions like this are usually inevitable with a movie like The Sixth Sense, and I think that they could have been answered if the film would have gone into how it's possible for these people not to know that they are dead, even though the back of their head is blown out, or half of the skin on their face has been burned off. Do they just perceive everything as being normal? I don't know, but either way, despite trivial shortcomings like this, The Sixth Sense is a groundbreaking supernatural thriller, and you see something new in it every time you watch it. That's a rare quality that not many movies have. Don't miss this one."

","Ah, The Sixth Sense is by far one of the best movies of 1999, in the same class with Fight Club.  I have waited a very long time for a movie like this to scare me, and the wait was well worth it. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a distinguished child psychologist haunted by the painful memory of a disturbed young patient he was unable to help.  Willis has had some serious dramatic roles in his long career, but none this extreme. Whoever said `Never work with kids or animals' was right in this case.  As great as Willis was in The Sixth Sense, 10 year old Haley Joel Osment stole the show with his riveting performance as Cole Sear, a frightened, confused eight year old with a similar condition as the young boy Willis was ultimately unable to help; the ability to `see dead people.' <br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan hit the big time in only his second time behind the camera.  Never before has a director been able to portray the type of fear and surprise on camera that I felt when watching The Sixth Sense, and I know that everyone who watched it feels the same. This is one of those movies where the director challenges the audience to `figure out' the ending before it gives it away, and since it is like that, everyone will be on the edge of their seats trying to guess what will happen next.  I will admit, and I wasn't alone, I never figured it out, and even after the movie was over and for the next few days, I was periodically saying, out loud, `That's why that happened' and `Oh, now I get it.'  This is exactly the reason The Sixth Sense gets a perfect 10 stars from me."

","Haley Joel Osment is truly a boy wonder. His acting really made you feel scared, on top of all the scary visual scenes. I've only known a few kids that young who can pull off a movie role that required a class of acting not many adults can achieve, and to do it so well. Kudos, kid. You'll go far.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis wasn't really the actor I had in mind for his role as a psychiatrist. I thought someone like Harrison Ford might be better. Nevertheless, Willis did put in a commendable performance, and because the movie was so riveting you hardly noticed his woodenness sometimes.<br/><br/>Although this movie does not have spooks jumping out at you for shock effects, it still manages to put a kind of fear in you that cannot be described. The ghosts weren't really scary, but the setting for them to appear and the music that accompanied it, (and of course Osment's acting) made them something not feared in the normal sense, but feared cos no one wants to experience it at all. Then ending is superb, and I just hope no one spoils it for you cos it's just brilliant."

","This is one of those movies that needs to be seen more than once. In fact, after the first viewing, the movie almost compels one to see it again. And, with each screening, it gets better. The storyline is fabulous -- it is well developed, and the characters are well played. To say that there are twists and turns would be to understate the artistic qualities that make the movie such a hit.<br/><br/>At first, the role played by Bruce Willis seems so out of character with his usual persona on screen. But, he is wonderful as Dr. Malcomb Crowe who struggles through the movie, wondering if he could have done more with those he is called to help. Toni Collette, as the mother of young Cole (played by Haley Joel Osment) was nominated for an Academy award. But, Olivia Williams' portrayal of Crowe's wife is the real award winning performance. She plays a woman torn between the work of her award winning husband, and her own life.<br/><br/>The building relationship between Bruce Willis' character and that of Haley Joel Osment is well executed. Willis wants to help, then realizes he may not be helping, but then he stays on to help the young man confront and deal with his ""secret.""<br/><br/>This film is on a par with the best Hitchcock classics. M. Night Shyamalan has a gift as a writer and director, and he excelled in this film. As a cinemagraphic work of art, the film is superior. The camera angles and the outstanding use of lighting should be required study for future films. The dialogue is mature, and the storyline is thought provoking. The subtle nuances in the script and props are compelling. The special effects are at times a little gruesome, if not morbid. But then, what do you expect from a film where a little boy sees dead people.<br/><br/>For those looking to add to their home video collection, this is a ""must have."""

","The ending was a real surprise to me anyway, and to my mind involves far less cheating than many final twists of this type; even thematically, it's fairly consistent with the movie's surprisingly consistent tone of troubled concentration. The performances all contribute ably to this atmosphere of quivering melancholy; certainly the dialogue is heavy-handed at times, and although the contrast of the kid's visions and Willis'	 personal pain is valid in thematic terms and broadly successful as melodrama, it also lends itself to a lot of portentous soul-searching and wallowing (which admittedly looks better when you think back on the thing with the hindsight of knowing where it's going). The movie marshals its shock effects wisely and for maximum impact, and in the post-funeral scene among others achieves an almost Blair Witch-like sense of unbearable apprehension, imminent trauma and desire to run out of the theater. Still, its commercial calculations make it ultimately less interesting than that film."

The movies' ""rules"" (which are explained after the credits in a postscript trailer on the tape by Shyamalan and others) left me with the feeling that there was an attempt going down to distract me from thinking too much about what I had seen, or not seen, in the movie. All the rules were explained except one, and it was ""the big one"" which others have mentioned in their comments as well.  I would agree with anyone who would say that fixing these holes would be a prodigious undertaking but I think it was possible and should have been attempted.<br/><br/>From an entertainment perspective this movie was great but that facial hair (logic holes) should have (and could have) been shaved off - and it would have been perfect.

The first flaw is not in the film, but in the trailer.  Yes, ""I see dead people"" is an enticing line, but I would have given anything to see this movie without knowing that in advance.  It really detracted from the early suspense.  And, the big surprise ending I hear about is so obvious that I thought the surprise might be that the obvious ending didn't occur (and this would have made it a better film).  Unfortuantly, the obvious does happen and they use very heavy-handed flashbacks to make sure even the dumbest in the audience get the idea.<br/><br/>Other than these flaws, it's an excellent film."

"paulmst3k","6","0","0","11 August 2000"," Good movie, but a few flaws...
","I believe that this film is very good, but not good enough to be spot #23 on the IMDB top 250 list.  First of all, the movie is a little bit overrated. (which is understandable because no other decent movies were out at the time except for Phantom Menace) <br/><br/>Second of all, great movies get better each time you watch them.  With each viewing, Sixth Sense gets less and less exciting and turns almost to the point of boring.  The characters and their problems are not interesting enough to watch again and again.  By the third time you've seen it, the movie becomes mediocre, knowing the ending does not make this movie good. (However, it is fun to point out things you didn't notice before about...well, *you know* (I don't wish to have a spoiler in comment)) Anyway, the problems with the characters is that they are too much the same. They're not melodramatic, but both Willis and (I forget his name) ""the quiet kid"" say all their lines in the same kind of serious, low-toned voice. There is feeling behind the lines, but not enough variety of feeling.<br/><br/>Finally, there are a few plot holes, but I don't wish to discuss them because previous commenters already have.  Cole ""the quiet kid"" did a fine acting job (compared to all the other kid actors out there, he looks like Orson Welles) it wasn't incredibly entertaining to watch his acting skills, but they were good.  I hope the poor kid isn't scarred for life by the tone of the movie, and I hope he doesn't become type-casted and turn into another MacCullay Culkin.<br/><br/>Anyway, a good suspenful movie (not really scary) and I would strongly recommend watching the movie once, but not twice, and definately not six times."

This movie had restored my faith in american horror movies once again, something i thought it wouldn´t happen in a million years, after having to put up with endless Freddy Krugger, Jason and countless horror teen movies. I was totally convinced that Hollywood had just abandoned adult scary horror forever.  For years i wished i could watch another, THE CHANGELING, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, THE HAUNTING (the original), even the first POLTERGEIST. Finally after seeing there were no horror movies anymore, just, teen-make-you-jump-on-the-chair-with-loud-music-flics, i wasn´t totally convinced THE SIXTH SENSE was going to be as good as it promised. I was wrong.<br/><br/>Of course i guess everybody has already seen it by now, so those of you who also love the movie, know what i´m talking about. So what can i say, that hasn´t been said ?...That the story is fantastic, the atmosphere is perfect and the actors are great ? Well this doesn´t begin to describe how good this movie is. And for those people who still insist that the plot has holes, i suggest you go see it again, because i´m sure you must have seen it only once, or you didn´t paid enough atention the second time. There are no holes in this plot. This is a brilliant and detailled screenplay with the precision of a swiss clock. It´s funny how most of the people who complain about the plot holes in this movie are the same who claim that the middle of the movie is empty and too much slow paced. Maybe if those persons,  had paid atention to the details instead of waiting for an action scene they would noticed how crammed with plot clues and attention to eventual plot holes this movie is, particulary in the ""empty"" scenes. There are no plot holes in THE SIXTH SENSE, and even just for this this movie deserved to be praised. By the way, check the DVD for more on this if you still think the plot is wrong, maybe this will convince you.<br/><br/>Anyway, what more can i say ? This movie is a modern masterpiece, and one of the greatest real horror movies of all time. And it doesn´t have special effects, buckets of blood, gore or action scenes in it. Just a good story and a creepy atmosphere through out. This is how you do an horror movie.<br/><br/>I hope somebody in Hollywood is taking notes, because i would love to see more like this.

But except for the ending (terrific) it failed completely to come up to my expectations, most of the time it was not even exciting nor thrilling. The movie is actually above average due to the outstanding performance of Haley Joel Osment. Bruce Willis tried really hard to act well, but he did not succeed. I like Bruce, but only in action movies. 6 outta 10"

","The Basic Plot:A young, seemingly disturbed boy has frightening visions of the dead, and a melancholy psychiatrist tries to help him.<br/><br/>The praise:Chilling, the understated script and dialogue counteracts in a way to the powerful and psychological imagery of old homes, dark streets, frightening bodies ,churches and formal areas. Haley Joel Osmont is brilliantly and lyrically understated, and Bruce Willis is fine too . More like a grim concerto than a horror film, it is what it is.Great autumnal hues, and a fuzzy soundtrack which fits it well.<br/><br/>The flaws:Sometimes the taste is too classical for some,although at times the movie can be a little boring until another great image comes on."

","So here it is. THE psychological/supernatural thriller of the new millennium, rewarded with 6 Academy award nominations. I expected a lot here, and got what i expected. A great, and sometimes chilling movie. I have to admit there were times i grew a bit restless while watching. After all, the boy was seeing things that other people couldn't see. Even we as an audience couldn't see. And it's hard to sympathize with this kid if we don't understand what scares him. But we got to see it about 30 minutes into the movie. The images presented to us were sometimes scary, as the deceased people the boy claims to see are in the state they were when they died. E.g. A boy who played with his father's gun, misses the back of his head. In the end comes the surprise you wouldn't have guessed if you tried. Which just proves how involving the movie is because the obvious clues to the surprise are there in plain view throughout the movie. To the people who haven't seen the movie yet, I dare you to guess the surprise even now i've said these things.<br/><br/>Sixth sense is a great, if somewhat overhyped movie.

"Self-4","7","0","0","25 July 2000"," A major disappointment
","{SPOILERS ahead}    I never felt so rotten after watching a movie in my whole life. I admit it, I did not guess the ending, but that is precisely what made the movie so awful. To elaborate, every movie has its story line, a set of rules it must abide by to stay logical and entertaining. When a movie follows these rules and still manages to deliver a surprising, dramatic show then I can call the movie great. Sixth Sense did all that only to reveal in the last minutes  that Willis was dead, an idea that crawled, perhaps, into many people's minds but was so illogical that it simply did not make sense.<br/><br/>I am sure you know all about the plot holes. Like the fact that Willis was dumb enough not to notice that something was wrong. What, he didn't attend his own funeral? Never called anyone on the phone? Where did he get information about the boy in the first place? Never tried to talk to any living being, including his wife? How about having to go to a bathroom for crying out loud!!! Now, the script tries to nullify the hole by giving Cole this line: ""They(dead people) see what they want to see"". Is this supposed to cover everything? Willis may be dumb but his character is NOT. In the movie Ghost, Demi Moore's husband played by Patrick Swayze finds out that he is dead in the first 5 minutes after getting shot. It takes more than a year for Willis to do the same. Yeah! That makes sense...<br/><br/>But the biggest blow is the main area of the plot - the reason why Willis wants to help the boy - putting it simply, Cole is afraid of the ghosts, the cause of his mood disorders (at least that's what Willis thinks). But Willis IS a ghost! To deny the fact(like many reviewers here do) that the boy doesn't know Willis is a ghost is outrageous. Cole isn't stupid either - he knows nobody can see Willis's character, not his mom, no one!!! Yet he is not afraid of the doctor. It follows that if he is not afraid of Willis then he shouldn't be afraid of any ghost. But this doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>I saw the movie only once but I can also recall that Willis, outraged by the sight of his wife kissing another man does something to the store door or window. This produces a sound!!! But can a dead man interact with the real world? Nope!!! Not in every other similar situation (like when he tried to open the door to the cellar). Another nonsensical point.<br/><br/>There are numerous other holes that people here mentioned. I am not going to mention them all. Don't get me wrong. I am not trying to deny the fact that the movies was shot beautifully. Almost everyone played his or her role to perfection. It was at times scary. However, I sincerely believe that the movie would not have been given so many rave reviews if it weren't for the shocking ending. Somehow people managed to see past its lack of logic and rationality and give it a perfect 10. Believe me... that's what the director of the movie was hoping for. In the end, Sixth Sense just doesn't play by its own rules. Too bad, it could have been a good one."

","This isn't really a spoiler, but I wouldn't read it if you have not seen the film anyway.<br/><br/>I think this movie worked on so many levels that it would have to be called ""layered"".  Many leave the theater in awe of the GIANT plot twist, obviously, but that seems to only be the icing on an already richly sweet cake.<br/><br/>Almost everyone agrees that the movie was a whole entity before its shocking conclusion surprised them.  I've never seen a plot twister that relied so little on it's ""big secret"".  Perhaps that is part of the reason that so few guessed the ending before it materialized; the audience was so enthralled by the drama, suspense, and downright eerieness of the film that the notion that the wool was being pulled over their eyes simply did not occur to them. This is what made the ending so shocking and incredible.<br/><br/>However, a plot twist, in the end, is really just a gimmick.  The layers that made the film so complete were plentiful.  The tone and pacing of the film were appropriate, the directing was obviously focused, and the performances were stupendous.  Truly stupendous.<br/><br/>Toni Nicolette: touching.  Donnie Walberg: unsettling.  Haley Joel Osment: inspiring.<br/><br/>Hollywood loves to manufacture its child stars and milk whatever attention they can out of their cute faces.  Too often young stars are credited with undue respect. It is seen to be incredible for a child to pull off an emotionally complex role.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment did not simply ""pull it off"".  He did not merely ""portray"" a character.  He made a character real.  He made us all feel as terrified and as alone and helpless as a boy so cursed would.  I was moved.<br/><br/>Donnie Walberg's part was small, but the madness in his face cast a shadow over every moment that followed it.  It prompted me once again to ask why his brother receives so much more work than he.<br/><br/>Finally, Toni Nicolette.  I had no idea the level at which her talent reaches.  Now I do.  I will watch her in the future.<br/><br/>Overall?   8 out of 10"

Before I watched it for the first time, I already had great expectations, what is not good, the chances you have to be disappointed is much bigger then. But the opposite happened: I left the cinema wondering how M. Night Shyamalan could do something so perfectly arranged and also coherent. And I am not just talking about the plot, the soundtrack, the camera movements, everything seems to be in the right place.<br/><br/>Cole is a twelve-year-old boy who would be like every children in his age if there weren't this simple fact: he can see dead people! The story is focus on Cole's little issue and how Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) will find a way to help him. The movie also has beautiful background themes like: love, losing a close person, familiar relationships, human cruelty, friendship, human rational beliefs and how people always try to find reasonable explanation for everything, beyond of course the relationship between doctor and patient, how they have to be confident with each other to find out the answers.<br/><br/>It's not a movie to make people scared like horror films, but it has the elements that can make you jump out of the chair and fell chills in your neck whiling watching it. The bad news is after this movie you might have another opinion about chills ... The same thing will happen about things we can't find anywhere... Never mind, when you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The three things I admire the most about this movie, one for each time I saw it, are: the Haley Joel Osment performance  an Oscar deserved one, the techniques  how it really keeps the watchers attention, and how everything directs to the amazing surprise at the end.

Hayley Joel Osmet is very good in his role.  There is a certain conviction to his voice and you can see it in his eyes, that he really believes he sees dead people.  The way he relates to Willis is refreshing in movies.  Most of the time, kids are either saying something smart or acting silly, not this kid.  He's tortured, and he's scared.

"BuddyBoy1961","9","0","0","12 July 2000"," But for the supernatural element, tone is similar to ""Kramer vs Kramer""
","Here is an unexpectedly poignant and utterly unpretentious ghost story. Bruce Willis is understated but effective as a child psychologist who is compelled to redeem a past failure by counseling a troubled 8-year-old boy who eventually professes to being able to ""see dead people"". Never gimmicky or over-the-top, ""The Sixth Sense"" presents us with three very real people: Willis, the boy (Osment) and his mother (Collette), each trying to cope with a unique personal trauma. Not unlike ""The Exorcist"", the film draws us into the characters' dilemmas by devoting much of its first half to letting us empathize with the leads and share in their lives, then compelling us to experience their mounting turmoil. But unlike so many horror films of the past 20 years, ""The Sixth Sense"" unexpectedly eschews cheap shocks and gore for simple, potent drama and the painful revelations that accompany life and death. The three leads are uniformly excellent, but it is Willis who surprises; never in his career has Willis relied so predominantly on the subtlest of facial expressions to convey his emotional state, and here he accomplishes this vital feat admirably."

DUH!<br/><br/>First of all, the boy says that he can see dead people walking around. They don't realize they are dead and (most people missed this part of it) THEY ONLY SEE WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE.<br/><br/>The critics mentioned above ask why Willis could go for a year without his wife acknowledging his presence, or how could he sit in the room with the boy's mother and not have her say even a word to him. Well, this would apply to any of the dead people that don't know that they are dead, not just Willis' character. Wouldn't a dead kid also realize that he hasn't been to school in awhile, or turned in his homework, or that his mother hasn't awakened him in the morning for school? If you can't accept a movie which has dead people walking around, then you should go watch Runaway Bride again. This is not your genre.<br/><br/>I think the explanation that the dead people only see what they want to see is sufficient. Sure, it's a handwaving job, but just reeeeelax, sit back and enjoy the movie. After all, if you liked the classic Poltergeist, did you ask yourself how a tree could break a window and grab the kid from his bed?<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a masterpiece, which is surprising for a 1999 film.

OR in the case of when he went to see Cole at his house, he is sitting with cole's mom--- wouldn't it seem feasible to want to strike up a discussing with the mother of a boy whom you are trying to solve his ""mental problems""???<br/><br/>     I just find it hard to believe that a man would not try to communicate with anyone throughout the duration of the time he is examining Cole, beacause he is DEAD so therefore if he did, he would surely realize something is wrong, why would everyone ignore him? hmm<br/><br/>     This is about the only point of the movie that keeps it from a 10 for me.  The plot is well-developed, and Willis does a good job portraying Crowe.   Osment is the real star of this movie though.  The kid puts on one heck of a performance!  You believe his pain, his fear, and want to see his problems resolved.   Also, I would have liked to see Cole help the ghosts in his house ( the wife and the kid with the bullet wound) and maybe tell the audience a little more about the backgrounds of the ghosts to add more of an eerie twist. But a solid movie nonetheless<br/><br/>  8 out of 10 p.s. if you like this movie watch Jacob's Ladder, another psychological thriller with a litter darker theme"

","I liked this movie because it is good entertainment. Its ideas of ghosts and spirits, of powers that heal are nice. And no one can possibly have forseen the unforgettable ending<br/><br/>However, the movie is a far cry from ""Brilliant!"" or ""Masterpiece!"" status. At times very slow-moving, it centers too much on the little boy's supernatural encounters, incidents and not nearly enough on the effect it has on the people around him. The plot is not well-developed enough. It seems that Bruce Willis' character decides ""ooooh if you help them, they will go away."" He does, and they go away. Very sappy and forgettable.<br/><br/>Haley Joel does give a good performance for someone of his age, and Willis is crucial in his supporting role. The conversation with his mother in the car was touching, but moments of real emotional epiphanies are few in this movie.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br/><br/>
I'd like to make a few comments about The Sixth Sense.  I rather enjoyed it, and was completely taken by surprised by the twist at the end.  But there a few points that slightly marred it for me.  These are rather small points, mind you.<br/><br/>First of all, there are loose ends everywhere, which most people will probably have spotted.  This is all right if you can turn off your critical mind for a couple of hours and just go with the flow, but for those who like everything neatly falling into place at the end, if fails quite conspicuously.<br/><br/>There was no need (I think) to suggest that the boy had mind-reading abilities (as when he unexpectedly told his teacher about his past) and then just drop the matter altogether.  Mind-reading could be a subject for an entirely different film.  As treated in The Sixth Sense it makes a couple of brief appearances, then sort of hangs outside the main story, not quite fitting in anywhere.  This overloaded the plot for me somewhat.  It should simply have been left out.<br/><br/>Also, I dislike having to be told explicitly what one should be able to understand on his own with little effort.  An example is when Cole's mother is talking out loud in her sleep, and Cole overhears her saying something like ""Cole, what's wrong with you?"" etc.  It should be obvious that she's worried about him -- she is his mother after all.  Are we so dumb that it has to be spelt out in red for us?  There are other such examples in the film.  Also, when Willis's character visits Cole in hospital, and explains to him why he wants to help Cole so much, in essence spelling out the main storyline in clear, unambiguous, single syllables.  Okay, he was talking to a ten-year old boy, but I can't help thinking that the scene was designed for the benefit of the audience.  Willis's motivation was clear enough.<br/><br/>And then there's the fact that Willis's character, being dead, is not recognised by Cole as being dead, even though Cole recoils in horror at the sight of every other dead person he sees.  Maybe I missed something -- could someone drop me an E-mail explaining why this is so?  Thanks.<br/><br/>There is a difficulty in portraying convincing characters in a film that is intended to scare you.  The spectacle rather overshadows the characters. It's hard to reconcile the two.  This film did a much better job than most other films of this genre.  On the whole I was entertained, but with a little more care it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Mike."

","The only good thing that this movie has going for it is the acting by Collette and Osmont.  Willis' character is okay, but dull.  I would have preferred ghosts that were not visible to the audience.  The movie would have been more chilling in black and white.  The screenplay is average and incoherent.  However, the movie is better than Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" (1963).  For a great ghost movie, check out ""The Innocents"" (1961) or ""The Changeling"" (1980).  score: 8 (out of 10)."

I'm 19 and I know I'd certainly get scared of dead people walking around, but this boy must be 8 or 9 years old. That would be terribly frightening for a child at that age.  I just can't help but feel sorry for him.  Aside from that the film was quite perplexing because I did not realize that the psychologist was dead until the end of the movie.

It had a few effects, mostly gore and such, but overall, the cinema-photography, a deeper-than-first-glance plot, and stirring film score gave this movie my high rating.<br/><br/>The cinema-photography was excellent.  Mr. Shyamalan (The Director) really knows how to compose a scene, so that you understand not only what the script is telling you, but what the director wants you to feel.<br/><br/>The plot was great, as well.  I won't give the major surprises away, in case some of you have yet to see it,  but suffice it to say, I haven't seen a plot this involving and deep in a very long time.  And just when you think you can't possibly be more emotionally drained, the end comes, and you want to go right back to the ticket office, and buy another go-around.<br/><br/>The music was also very touching.  Written by James Howard, (Who also did the music for Disney's recent ""Dinosaur"") the score moves you almost as well as the storyline.  The themes presented seamlessly integrate with the events unfolding before your eyes...<br/><br/>I believe most people who have seen this film will agree with me...<br/><br/>And those who have yet to see this movie...

I was swayed into thinking it was another atmospheric horror film (Stir of Echoes and dozens more in recent years), complete with an eerie, whining child lead. Not so. Don't believe whatever you thought you saw in the coming attractions. Haley Joel Osment is strikingly-convincing as the troubled Cole Sear (odd name, though) whose gift for transcending the realms of the perceived living world has those close to him deeply concerned.<br/><br/>But are they any more alive than the emaciated, mutilated creatures who haunt him?<br/><br/>That is the question for you, the viewer, to answer.

There is no doubt in my mind after viewing this film that Bruce Willis deserves more attention as a serious dramatic actor.<br/><br/>Despite a unfortunate degree of predictability about this movie, I definitely recommend it based on its acting (by Willis and the incredibly young and talented Osment) and story which could be compared to the films ""Ghost"" and ""Jacobs Ladder"" yet neither of these were as scary.

","I posted my comments on this movie a while back, but having read some of the latest reviews, I feel compelled to add the following:<br/><br/>
SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>
There is obviously a division here between those who loved it and those who complain about so-called plot holes or things that don't add up. (I'm EXCLUDING those users who couldn't stay awake because there were no explosions!)<br/><br/>This film clearly operates on a metaphysical level. In my opinion, one's ability/willingness to accept this, with all its accompanying mysteries, is the key to understanding and appreciating this film. Malcolm and the other ""ghosts"" may be technically dead, but they have not yet completed their journeys into the afterlife. They are caught between the world of the living and the world of the dead. A very important aspect in this regard is Cole's crucial words to Malcolm: ""They don't know that they are dead, they only see what they want to see."" Does that mean that they think they are still alive? Not necessarily. It may simply mean that they experience their in-between-world as the real, living world. But they are not active participants in this world. They don't communicate with the living (with the exception of Cole) and they don't have the same needs as the living. Therefore the notion that Malcolm should have noticed that no-one else acknowledges his existence, as one user has suggested, is quite ridiculous. He would not have gone into a store to buy food!!! It is equally ridiculous to question the time lapse between the shooting incident and Malcolm's first meeting with Cole. What does time mean to ""ghosts""? Do they sometimes wander around aimlessly? Do they approach more than one ""gifted"" person and then move on to another if they are not helped? I don't know, and I have a suspicion you don't either.  <br/><br/>It is also important to note that the ""ghosts"" were focused primarily on their unfinished business. They needed closure before they could move on. What was Malcolm's unfinished business? His perceived failure as a husband and therapist. So when he seeks out Cole, it is to resolve both these issues. He achieves this by helping Cole understand and accept his gift, and Cole helps him to make peace with his wife. (She believed she came second, remember?)<br/><br/>It has also been asked why Cole isn't scared of Malcolm when he first meets him. He IS - Malcolm waits for him outside, but Cole senses his presence and starts walking faster and faster and so avoids him. But then Malcolm approaches him in the church, which is a safe sanctuary. And no, that does not necessarily mean that no other ""ghosts' ever entered the church, it only means that Cole felt safe there!! Still weary, of course, but safe. Malcolm also approached Cole differently (less threateningly) than the other ""ghosts"" did, because, I believe, part of his unfinished business had to do with Cole specifically (redemption for failing his former patient). To put it simply, he helped himself by helping Cole.<br/><br/>As for the ""cold air breathing"" aspect: this went hand-in-hand with the intensity of the ""ghosts'"" presence. Which is why it was so pronounced when Cole was scared. That it happens at the end with Malcolm's wife, is particularly relevant. It signifies the intensity of his presence, which he reveals to her when he is ready to talk to her. He makes a connection with her and she becomes AWARE of his presence. He is then able to tell her that which he didn't tell her before he died. He can say goodbye.<br/><br/>This, of course, is only my interpretation. But to me it makes perfect sense. And I'm glad that it does, otherwise I would have lost out on one of the most wonderful movie experiences ever!"

","The Sixth Sense is really two movies - one that works and one that simply doesn't.<br/><br/>The part of The Sixth Sense that does work is the just about everything NOT directly related to the surprise twist at the end - the little boy's seeing the ghosts, the problems it causes in his life, his relationship with his mother and the psychologist, and the psychologist's guilt over a similar patient from his past. It is all beautifully acted and shot, and a refreshing change from the excessive gore, profanity, nudity and sex we are so often subjected to in the movies. It wasn't exactly the scariest movie I have ever seen, but some of the scenes were quite chilling - such as the one where the little boy sees the female ghost in the kitchen and for a split second he (and the viewer) believes it to be his mother.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I knew going in that there was going to be a twist ending having to do with someone being dead and not knowing it, although I wasn't sure which character. It became pretty clear as the film went on that it HAD to be Bruce Willis' character, but then again it simply didn't track logically. How on earth could someone be dead and not know it? Or at least not be able to figure out that something strange was going on (for example, why he couldn't communicate with anyone but the kid). Since it was completely unbelievable, the ending left me feeling flat, which is too bad because almost everything else about the movie was classy and well-done."

","Boy, was ""Sixth Sense"" not the movie I expected.  It's not your typical gory horror flick, and there are no scenes of people running for their lives from ghouls.  No, this film is much more subtle than that.  In fact, it's one of the quietest movies I can remember seeing.  While most summer movies shout at you, this one whispers.  And while most summer movies race from scene to scene, this one inches forward.  Of course, sometimes watching this movie is like watching a glacier melt, but the ending makes it all worthwhile.  (In fact, after the first viewing, you'll never have quite the same reaction to the movie.  You'll know too much the second time.  But the plot will make more sense.)  Excellent acting all around, including an admirably subdued Bruce Willis and the talented Haley Joel Osment.  Willis and Osment play off each other well.  And I agree with whomever said Osment would've made a great Anakin Skywalker.  Be forewarned: while there are a couple of light moments, this is a fairly serious and restrained movie.

","I'd originally held out on viewing this film for as long as possible in order to savor the experience known as ""The Sixth Sense"" in the company of solitude.  Yet thanks to the asininity of a couple of prepubescent girls who decided it would be entertaining to spoil the film at the expense of an entire classroom of high school students, I became reluctant to attend the theater and rent the movie for a number of months.<br/><br/>When I finally obtained a copy of the movie and inserted it into the VCR, rancor towards the aforementioned individuals returned in the blink of an eye.  Upon reading in the opening credits that James Newton Howard had composed the soundtrack, however, I allowed myself to become immersed in the film, and from then on was not once subjected to straying thoughts.<br/><br/>In the case of ""The Sixth Sense,"" the director had a vision--and this vision came through in such an efficient manner that the final creation was not a movie, but rather, an experience: an experience which comes together on every conceivable level, from the acting to the musical score, that leads the viewer through a first-hand perspective of what each character is seeing and experiencing on an emotional level, with the revelations that force their way onto the air evoking the same reaction from the viewer as the fictional characters on the screen.<br/><br/>It does not serve much of a purpose to elaborate on any specific aspect of this film;  as it stands, everything is as close to perfection as it can possibly be in a movie.  Perhaps the only flaw is that for first-time viewers, emotional or detached, analytical dispositions will grant an entirely different perspective on the movie and its merits as far as suspense is concerned.  But since profound cynicism is required to blatantly disregard the merits of this film, there should be something to appeal to each and every viewer."

Which is the only reason I can think of why it took me so completely by surprise. It started promisingly, with a quite disturbing intruder scene and a gunshot. Suddenly, its ""The Next Fall"" (Autumn for us Brits!) and here is a man, previously injured by said gunshot, pick up the case of an odd young man with similar childhood problems to his attacker. At this point I had no reason to think that anything was amiss. If you don't start to wonder at this point, it's too late. I was completely drawn into the relationships between the characters and this young man's plight. Obviously I wasn't watching it in the same state of mind as others, who may have guessed the ""surprise"" right away. Call me thick or whatever, but I feel better off than those who did guess. Because they will have missed out on one of the greatest movie experiences for some time.<br/><br/>Its a very personal drama with delicate performances, combined with some extremely effective chills. It slowly moves along to it's conclusion, introducing several elements on the way to distract you. Cole's mother's anguish at not understanding what is happening to her son is well portrayed. As things progressed, I thought ""this is a good film"". Then towards the end, a quite devastating shock is revealed at the dead little girl's wake (whom Cole is now trying to help.) I was so repulsed at and chilled with what was revealed here. Now it was a ""great film"". As things were being tied up, with a quite emotional scene between Cole and his mother, then between Malcolm and his wife- BANG! It happened. As Malcolm looked at his hand, my blood froze. And it stayed frozen till the close and well into the end credits. I walked out into the night air, I was dizzy. I hadn't walked out of the cinema feeling like that for a long long time. It's not the most original surprise ending, but it's certainly up there with the best of them.<br/><br/>Now, here I am, after buying the DVD and watching it a second time. And even though I know the ending and how obvious it is in hindsight, It still has a great effect on me as I remember my feelings during the first viewing. But isn't that what all great films do...<br/><br/>This film has generated a lot of debate in this forum, which says more about it's quality than I can."

","The sixth sense has to be one of the scarriest films ever made. The whole idea of the movie is very thought provoking and can make you lose a lot of sleep. The story is basically about a little boy who can see dead people wondering around but the final climax of the film is the ending which is superb. I do not recommend this film to anybody who gets scared easily although i think its a shame that such a great film should not be seen. Bruce Willis was very good in the film acting his usual cool self but the highlight of all the acting in the film has to go to Haley Osmont who played the little boy. Very rarely do we see such fine young actors. The only other young actors i thought who were as good was the little boy in ""The Champ"", the little boy in ""Kramer v Kramer"" and the little boy in ""ET"". Only The Exorcist can compete with this film on scary levels.....truly a masterpiece"

","We have all become so jaded with special effects and explosion a minute blockbusters that we often become restless with brilliant conventions that were used to shock us in films of the past.  These films now seem ""dated"". When thinking about the thrills in ""The Sixth Sense"".I am reminded somewhat of Hitchcock as I write this on the eve of the great one's one hundredth birthday.  But I think even more of a little known classic film,Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"".  In it Catherine Deneuve plays a woman who is repulsed by men.  She spends a good thirty to forty minutes in virtual silence drifting into insanity, so that by the time things begin to go bump in the night the viewer is jumping out of their seat. Those who criticize the slowness of this films exposition don't seem to realize how important it is to provide the latter thrills.  But almost every reviewer agrees that the ending is terrific.  I gave this film an eight overall, but I will say that even though I've rated a lot of films with 9's and even 10's over the last few years, it is the only film of late that I truly plan to enjoy a second time. With a much different perspective I might add."

"DblOught","Null","0","0","31 May 2000"," Technically marvelous but keeps its ace in the hole showing
","This is a good example of a film that rests on its creative laurels and dispenses with all that icky ""story"" nonsense.<br/><br/>Excellent cinematography, lighting, acting, dialogue, and production design abound. It was refreshing to see Bruce Willis do well in a role that isn't summarized as ""make smartassed comments, kill terrorists"". The technical attributes are what make the movie worth seeing; the photography and lighting reflect the dreary subject matter of the film beautifully and with tension, where necessary.  It is for these things that I give ""The Sixth Sense"" very high marks.<br/><br/>So what's the problem?  Here's the problem.<br/><br/>What does everybody that hasn't already seen this movie know about it? ""I see dead people."" It's on the trailers and it's spoofed constantly on TV for comic effect, so everybody knows that this ""gift"" is the central focus of the story.  And that's fine with me.  There's just one problem:<br/><br/>That's the WHOLE story.<br/><br/>Little Cole sees dead people. Okay, so what of it? Since we already knew that from the trailers, the impact of the line and the revelation of that secret is lost when Cole spouts the line halfway into the movie.  I, for one, was left saying: ""we already knew that. NOW what?""<br/><br/>At least the makers of ""The Crying Game"" had the sense not to say ""Oh, by the way, IT'S A GUY!"" in the trailers for THAT film.<br/><br/>Other than that Cole sees dead people, there isn't really a whole lot going on in this film.  Okay, so the movie shows US some of the dead people.  Yes, it may make you jump in a couple of places, but that doesn't define a thriller.  I can sneak up behind a person and yell in his ear and make him flinch; that doesn't make me the master of suspense.<br/><br/>By and large, the genuine creepiness that DOES take place in this movie is effective, but sparse and short-lived.  And since we already know about the dead people, there really isn't much left for the audience, except for one thing.<br/><br/>***SPOILER WARNING***<br/><br/>The writer did leave himself an ace in the hole.  The problem is that it's almost completely given away by the end of the movie, to folks with a keen eye and sharp senses.<br/><br/>Everybody I knew that saw this movie before I did said: ""oh, man, it's great, you've gotta see it, the ending will blow your mind, etc.""  I started watching the movie.  Bruce Willis gets shot, and about twenty minutes later, since the shooting itself had not been brought up at all in the film since it took place, I started asking myself: ""okay, it was significant that the underwear-wearing guy in the bathroom blew his brains out... but that alone would have sealed the doctor's motivation for wanting to help this kid.  So why did the doctor have to get shot?""  Simple answer: so we can all find out at the end that he's already dead. Duh. Of course, that early in the film, it's only a hypothesis.  When the big secret is finally revealed, however, you've got so much evidence to support your theory packed into your head that there's no way you CAN'T be right. And, as it turns out, you ARE right. It's a surprise ending that fails to be a surprise.  <br/><br/>Therefore, for me, there was nothing interesting about this film in terms of story. And quite frankly, I wasn't too interested in the whole ""I see dead people"" concept to begin with.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie with an EFFECTIVE sucker-punch ending, try ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""Fight Club""."

","So what if you can see dead people? The interesting plot brings us towards new conception of fear of knowing too much. As we know, we usually guess about things we can't see or won't see. But IF and only if we CAN SEE them? We are forced to accept the world around us in multi dimensional.<br/><br/>Another interesting plot is to confront our fear. The next step after accepting is dealing with it. What can we do better with this ability? How should we do it?<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense couldn't be done without Harvey's performance. He outcaste Bruce Willis. Playing as a child with supernatural gift, he stand alone like a SITH, a character-race in Star Wars (Lord Sith, Darth Maul, etc.), with power and ability causes other to fear and stay away from them. And here, we can see he is alienated from his mother, and friends. And almost from those spirits he saw. No secrets in that.<br/><br/>One plot we are not suppose to reveal is Bruce Willis' character. He is, yes, a psychologist with a deep trauma after some patient attempt to murder him, but here we can see another fact. We are, indeed almost always trying to ignore our fate and conditions. We do our best to cover our pain and failure, as we're trying to move along and to forget it. But unless you're dealing with your deepest pain and failure, you will be able to move forward better. And healthier.<br/><br/>The movie is about us, dealing with ourselves, our pain and ability. It is packed with suspense and thrills and a bit of horror, but blanketed with drama and tragic reality.

","This movie was genuinely scary, unnerving, and disturbing. Yet the scariness of the movie certainly does not come out of mindless gore or unrealistic monsters. It comes out of sheer, basic, suspense, the likes of which I may have never seen since Psycho, more than Silence of the Lambs and Seven.<br/><br/>Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a nice man,a devoted husband and psychiatrist. So good is he at his work, he receives a plaque from the mayor commending him. However, his joy that night is brief, as his celebration with his wife is cut short by an unexpected blast from the past--a patient of Malcolm's that he couldn't help (Donnie Wahlberg in a short but memorable cameo). He tells Malcolm that he didn't help him, and he has still been miserable for the last 10 years because no one could pinpoint why he was so upset. He then pulls out a gun, shoots Malcolm in the gut, then blows his own brains out. Flash forward to 2 months later: Malcolm is standing near the house of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and his mother (Toni Colette). Cole has become a patient of his, and after reviewing Cole's case, Malcolm realizes that he and the man who shot him have a lot in common, and Malcolm sort of sees this as his shot at redemption for failing his other patient. The two meet and strike an instant rapport. But Cole is depressed, and always seems to look sad. His single mother is constantly stressed, trying to juggle two jobs and be a mother and father to Cole. She can not reach Cole herself, cannot understand why he is always so frightened. Eventually after Malcolm earns the trust of Cole, Cole tells him his secret: ""I See Dead People."" Cole explains to Malcolm that he constantly sees dead people walking around, not knowing that they are dead, and not seeing each other. Only Cole can see these people. At first Malcolm tries not to believe Cole, but after listening to a tape of one of his sessions with the man who shot him, he realizes Cole is telling the truth. The two have their individual problems, though. Malcolm and his wife haven't talked in months, they are now completely estranged from one another, and she seems to have found a new beau. Cole's mother wonders why her grandmothers pendant keeps getting moved, and gets furious when Cole denies taking it. The story goes on like this, telling about how Malcolm and Cole try to help each other This intelligent film is about 3 completely heart-wrenching relationships. Malcolm's relationship with his wife, Cole's relationship with his mother, and Malcolm and Cole's relationship with each other. All three are introduced to the story at the beginning, and at the end, all three are neatly and beautifully concluded. Possibly the most moving scene of the movie is when Cole comes home from school. He asks his mom how her difficult day was. She says: ""Well, I won the lottery this morning, I quit all my jobs, I picnicked in the park, and then swam in the fountain all afternoon."" She then asks Cole how his day went at his school (where everyone views him as a freak and an outcast). He answers: ""Well, I was picked first for dodgeball, I hit a game-winning grand slam, and everyone carried me off on their shoulders."" It shows how the only escape from their two difficult, miserable lives, is each other. The two most memorable things about this movie are Haley Joel Osment, who is nothing short of a revelation as Cole and who unjustly lost the academy award for Best Supporting Actor to the simple acting of Michael Caine for The Cider House Rules, and the ending, which clearly borrows a little something from The Usual Suspects. The rest of the cast is uniformly good, especially Toni Colette as Cole's mother. Bruce Willis does an admirable job as Malcolm, a very different character than he has played in his traditional movies. The writing and direction is some of the best you will ever see. M. Night Shyamalan has loaded the Sixth Sense with symbolism, foreshadowing, and clues to the big finish. He had the bad luck as coming out the same year as American Beauty, which was only a little better written , but much better directed. The Sixth Sense was nominated for 6 oscars: Best Picture, Supporting Actor Haley Joel Osment, Supporting Actress Toni Colette, Director Shyamalan, Writer Shyamalan, and Editing. It lost them all, unfortunately."

","Without a doubt this is one of Hollywood's better movies, but the hype & audience buzz surrounding the ""plot twist"" only goes to show just how poor the competition is (need I mention such titles as the laughable remake of ""The Haunting""?).<br/><br/>First of all Syamalan directs the cast with extraordinary dexterity & skill, the actors accomplishing this task in an equal manner. Hardest of all must have been Bruce Willis' part, as sticking to the rules of the game is not always as easy as it looks, although he would have had considerable help in the way the set was laid out for him to move through.<br/><br/>Osment is beleivable as any kid actor can be, with the vomitt inducing bucketloads of saccarrine,normal for this type of role, thankfully avoided. With Toni Collette as Osment's mother similarly avoiding easy cliches this is refreshing indeed! Olivia Williams hardly breaks surface in the plot, as the narrative mainly concerns Osment's portrayal of Cole Sear (""Sear"" can be pronounced as ""Seer"", as in someone who ""sees"", any coincidence there?) & his interaction with Willis' Malcom Crowe, but again she handles the part with expertise & this is important, as it is key to the plot development.<br/><br/>Ah, that much talked about ""plot"". Well for me it was obvious about 30 minutes into the film & after that it dragged right up until the end. There were several scary moments, none the less, with the section about the dead child's video tape an awful & all too believable revelation. Shyamalan was also right not to jump straight in with the dead people that Osment is supposed to see, that would have been an all too easy mistake to make & if there was any pressure on him from the Hollywood ""suits"" to do so then I'm glad he resisted it. Similar lazyness has been completely avoided too, with no sex & no violence, all which would have been expected at some point, but is mercifully absent from a story line that doesn't need it.<br/><br/>Even if you work it out, the ""plot twist"" at the end is once again done with skill & with an understated style that still managed an air of chill. I was left thinking that the same level of inteligence had been used as shown in ""The Usual Suspects"", despite the completely different subject matter (the latter, I'll admit, really DID keep me guessing to the end). For the way in which it gets the whole ensemble right, with no weakness in any area, I'd rate this film very highly. It is too slow for me, but that's a purely personal preference & probably because I was lucky (or twisted) enough to pick up on the clues. Knowing that there WAS a plot twist helped, after all. But since it doesn't put a foot wrong all the way through, that has got to be something of a rarity these days & the film has to be applauded as well worth the effort of seeing."

","This is a great movie - certainly the best one about the supernatural I have seen.   It is not only thrilling, but thought-provoking and moving - and is refreshingly free from the gore, foul language and gratuitous nudity which has often tarnished the genre.   After the explosive opening, the next 30 to 40 minutes seem slow, but then begins the build-up to the amazing climax - surely the best surprise ending since 'Witness for the Prosecution'. Only at the conclusion (and really only after a second viewing) does one see that the deliberate pacing of the earlier part was essential, that the apparent plot implausibilities are in fact perfectly logical, and how beautifully scripted and directed the film is.  Moreover, all the essential supernatural elements of the story have been reliably reported by reputable parapsychologists.  Bruce Willis (not the most obvious choice for the role of a child psychologist) is a revelation, Haley Joel Osment is a genuine find, and Toni Collette and Olivia Williams give faultless support.   It is a disgrace that this movie won only  a single Academy Award, for Editing - and particularly that M. Night Shymalan was not given the Oscar, at least for Best Screenplay. A film that restores your faith in modern Hollywood."

I have made it my mission that no one hear the ending by word of mouth, but instead see it. It's almost fun to make people figure it out, in the months since it's release I have seen the film about a dozen times. Every time I see it like to have someone there that hasn't seen this masterpiece yet. The reactions are almost as good as the film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it. The Sixth Sense is one of the films that makes you see what movie making is supposed to be like."

","Cole Sear has a problem - he sees dead people. Dr. Malcolm Crowe has a problem - Cole Sear sees dead people. Oh, and he has another problem too - his relationship with his wife has soured. Malcolm helps Cole come to terms with his problem, which in turn helps him, Malcolm, come to terms with his own. Cute, no ?<br/><br/>Well, that's how the movie opens; somewhat slower-paced than one would have liked, and even bumbling and incoherent in spots  - like the kid Cole messing about the dead girl's house. Also, the scene where Malcolm talks to the kid about the state of his marriage seemed a lot like the conversation between the kid and the old man in ""Home Alone"". A gnawing fear had begun to creep in at that point that this was turning into another ghastly ""feel good"" movie.<br/><br/>Luckily, the surprising twist in the end more than made up for all that. Hard to tell whether the movie bungles initially because the director just couldn't help it, or because he wanted to lull the viewer into tedium before delivering a solid parting punch. Either way, it packs quite a wallop with that ending.<br/><br/>For first time viewers - do not switch off (except to make out) because the movie began to get boring. I did, and I now feel like I have to see the movie again to appreciate some details (and to nitpick on some others)."

","I don't get excited about movies too often, and this year I've been thoroughly disappointed, having shelled out the bucks to see Star Wars, The Mummy, and American Pie--all big duds!  This is the best movie on the big screen since Saving Private Ryan, a true winner.  Bruce Willis puts on his best show, possibly of his entire career.  Osment is the best child actor I've seen since Tatum O'Neil in Paper Moon (1973).  His ability to capture all of the idiosyncrasies of a frightened boy with the ""6th sense"", those characteristics we the naive would never think of, is unheard-of in a child actor.  This movie has it all!  It's a thriller, horror, a little comedy, romance that will make you cry.  It's like Ghost (1990), taken to another level!  It is WELL worth the overpriced tickets!!"

","Having heard so much about how amazing the twist in the tail of this film is, and having missed it at the cinema, I spent a good few months scrupulously avoiding all reviews, articles etc which might possibly have hinted at what was going to happen, only to have all my hard work undone just a few weeks before the video came out (damn you Daisy Donovan). In spite of this I watched the film trying my hardest not to think about what I'd heard (i.e. trying to figure out how it was going to work out every two minutes or so) and still it was an awesome, staggering surprise at the end. Perhaps shrewder people would have found it a little trite from this viewpoint, but I had been expecting a simple horror movie, lots of running about screaming being chased by evil monsters type thing. What you get in the end, though it does provide plenty of jump-out-of-your-seat and shudder-with-fear moments, was a profound, touching, moving story about love and loss, which left me, hardened cynical old movie buff, beaming like a crazy thing at having seen such a great film, and my wife in floods of tears. A truly wonderful film, all the better for its lack of razzmatazz, the downbeat, restrained feel running through the grey-faced performances of all its excellent stars, the use of colours, the music, every aspect perfect through and through. Maybe on reflection there are a few niggling points, maybe they should have built more on how the boy sorts out his problem with the dead people and his relationship with his mother, but as an overall cinematic experience it's very, very impressive."

","The Sixth Sense has moved me in ways that no other movie has ever done. After seeing it on opening weekend, I have gone to the theatre three times with the intention of seeing something else - yet everytime I have ended up seeing 6th Sense again.<br/><br/>This is a movie of extraordinary power. It speaks to all of our human emotions and conditions: fear, uncertainty, guilt, isolation, love, hope, peace, etc...If this movie disappointed you, maybe the misleading trailer should be blamed. In my opinion, this is not a horror movie, nor is it a thriller. It's a drama with supernatural overtones. It is also the most heart wrenching love story I have ever come across.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>Whilst Haley Joel Osment (Cole) is absolutely magnificent, I don't agree that he played the lead, as some would suggest. Another user put it very well when she said that the movie was about one man's journey into the afterlife. It is in making this journey, that Malcolm (beautifully played by Bruce Willis) meets up with Cole, the link between the living world and the one that Malcolm now occupies. Malcolm, tormented by guilt about his failure as both a psychologist and a husband, is neither willing nor ready to let go. Ultimately, they help each other accept and understand their respective journeys. And in the process, a mother and child find each other, and a husband makes his peace with his grieving wife. ""Goodnight, Sweetheart"" is a line so filled with meaning that it will stay in my heart forever.<br/><br/>The fact that I have seen this movie four times, obviously indicates that it was not its ending that did it for me. I got that part when I read the plotline. Rather, it's the incredible atmosphere and power of the characters' emotions that spoke to me. So if you figured out the ending and was disappointed by the rest, a second viewing may just change your mind.<br/><br/>
10/10 with NO reservations!"

Everyone will identify with Cole, wonderfully played by Hayley Joel Osment. We have all had that feeling of being scared of the dark, hiding in our safe place, feeling the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, with no logical explanation why.  He manages to convey, with just a look, the true, paralysing horror of what he has seen. A word of congratulation must be added here for the director, M. Night Shyamalan.  It would have been so easy to cultivate a performance that included lots of screaming and eye rolling.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Toni Colette also give terrific performances; the best seen from Bruce in a long time.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending, but if you enjoyed the sense of pervading eeriness, as in The Woman in Black, then you will enjoy this."

Bruce Willis makes me glad I watch movies because he is just so good. <br/><br/>I was surprised to see how good Olivia Williams was in this film.

","The official Hollywood name for a film that comes out of nowhere to break box office records and upset the gravy chain is a 'sleeper'. There have been a fair few in the last couple of years, including THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and even THE MATRIX, which came as a huge shock to the Lucasfilm empire! But how refreshing it is when a small film suddenly makes it big in a world where everything is starting to get a bit too predictable. THE SIXTH SENSE did exactly that, as well as thrill us, shock us, and ultimately move us.<br/><br/>One should not 'review' this film in the literal sense. To do this would spoil a first-time viewing, not only in the plot but also the level at which this film operates. Sadly films like these become victims of their own hype, and one should remember to treat it as just a movie, albeit a very good one. The leads are all exceptional, the writing is superb and James Newton Howard has excelled himself with a spooky, but emotionally haunting score.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen THE SIXTH SENSE, then stop reading this right now and go and see it!

To use a common but appropriate cliche, The Sixth Sense is genius.<br/><br/>And it has so little to do with the ending, which seems a common fixation in this forum.  I love the atmosphere, the low-key performance of Bruce Willis, the breathless acting of Haley Joel Osment, the brilliant usage of color and setting, and the overall quiet and meditative pace of the film.

Its power resides not in spectral special effects and big explosions in the middle of city streets (sending cars flying into the air, no less), but instead on the requisite basics so often neglected these days:  a solid script, talented actors, a gripping score, and deft directing.

","Alright, I have watched this twice now and I must admit, an ending has never done more to shatter my illusion that I can't be completely fooled for 110 minutes. My hat is off to not only the director, but every friend I have that could have innocently spoiled this movie but didn't. I knew not of a surprise ending going in, and it definitely makes viewing #1 thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>OK, now to the holes. Most of them really are covered pretty nicely. And if they're not, well, as Howard Stern once said, ""For this movie, ya gotta suspend disbelief!""<br/><br/>Let's begin with the seemingly random use of extreme cold. This is the big, stinking, glarer of the whole film. It's used arbitrarily for effect, and omitted during scenes where had it been used, the surprise would have been wrecked early. I admit it's a bit of a cheat, so I won't use space defending it. If logic dictated all, Superman would never have gotten away with a pair of glasses and a comb-over for a suitable disguise. Forgive and forget.<br/><br/>Now, for the lack of a bullet hole. Cole does say that ""they only see what they want to see."" That explains Malcolm's not noticing he had a gaping exit wound in his lower back. As far as Cole not seeing it, well...the entrance wound was below the belt, and I never saw Cole standing behind Malcolm sans sportcoat. Shaky, I know...but how does Jimmy Stewart not notice Kim Novak #2 for God's sake! My point is, even the classics falter under the weight of heavy scrutiny.<br/><br/>The performances here neutral out any shortcuts taken to sustain the film. Bruce plays a low-key role with the same Everyman Having a Really Lousy Day quality he's brought to saving the world, a building, an airport, etc. Say what you want about the guy, but if the Martians showed up with space lasers cocked for real, who would you call? I really believed this character and it's a testament to his skills that he never appears to be condescending onscreen to his co-star, a common trap in adult-child pairings.<br/><br/>That brings me to little Forrest Gump, Jr. (Yes, THAT'S where you saw that kid before!) This was a big-time ACTING role, not a throw a cute kid into a harrowing situation and film his ""horrified"" reactions in cut-away shots. There were a couple of occasions where you could see him ""act"", but mostly, he handled quite a few different emotions with startling accuracy. I look forward to watching his career unfold. He's gonna be a good one, as long as he never, ever, ever finds himself left ""Home Alone"".<br/><br/>It's impossible to review this film without coming eventually to ""The Usual Suspects."" I've never cared for that film, because the ending never raises any valid questions that had never been considered before the surprise was revealed. On that count, this movie comes through in spades. After the first viewing, my head swirled with ""But, wait a minute...""'s, which began overlapping into each other as pieces fell together. The number of user comments on this film supports this point: This movie COMMANDS discussion, and that is no small feat.<br/><br/>One more thing WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH MOM'S SOUP? What possible back-story would motivate a woman to feed soup to her child made from Winona Ryder's ""Heathers"" recipe book? That was a VERY CHILLING scene, and was an interesting way to confirm to Malcolm and the audience that this ghost business was for real...but  talk about coming out of nowhere!!<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8 out of 10."

","It is all too often the case that a film will come along amidst a blaze of publicity and ultimatly fail to meet expectations. On the other hand once every few years a film will come out with little if any real hype and blow the competition away. In 1999 this film was The Sixth Sense. The premise is really very simple, ""boy sees dead people"" and were this a typical Hollywood picture this is exactly all you would have. However writer/director M. Night Shymalam brings a fresh approach which opens new possibilities that many others would not have wasted time or valuable budget on. For example, the special effects are kept to a bare minimum, so that when you do see something horrific it is genuinley disturbing unlike some films i.e. The Haunting. As with most films this one must rely on the performance of it's leading man or in this case boy. In this role Haley Joel Osment is a revelation, cue oscar nomination. He has excellent support from a brilliantly understated Bruce Willis and fellow oscar nominee Toni Collette. Finally for those of you who have been living in outer space, this film has a twist in it's tail that turns your whole perspective of the movie upside down, and this is certainly one of the reasons for it's huge box office sucess, (many people were going back to see it again).

","I've got an unusual story to tell you about ""The Sixth Sense"". When I first saw this movie when it first came out last August, I didn't care for it that much. Then the movie continued to make tons of money at the box office. I kept asking myself ""did I see this movie the wrong way?"" I didn't find it all that scary. When I go to see a horror film, I expect some scares and shocks and this movie didn't seem to provide that. Then this past February it got 6 Oscar nominations including Best Picture. So on the basis of that, I went back to see it a second time. And you know what? It turns out that this movie is pretty good after all. The second time I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" I saw the movie as a drama instead of a horror film and on that basis it works. The one thing I do agree on (even when I saw it the first time) is the outstanding performance by eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the boy who ""see's dead people"". He's terrific in this film. I hope we'll see lots of him in years to come. Also terrific, Australian actress Toni Collette as Lynn, Cole's mother. I didn't even know see was from Down Under since she's playing an American. I was very happy that Osment and Collette received Oscar nominations for their performances here (I think they both should have won). Bruce Willis, who was not recognized by the Academy (unfairly), gives one of the best performances of his career as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries to help the boy. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a well made thriller from an unknown writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, who received Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Too bad he had to lose both (if ""The Sixth Sense"" had been based on a novel and Shyamalan had adapted the novel to the big screen, he would have won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay; the movie didn't have a chance against ""American Beauty""). ""The Sixth Sense"" is definitely one of the biggest sleeper hits ever. Good job by all.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

I liked the visual moodiness of the film; it was almost expressionistic without the noir qualities.  It was very eerie.  I didn't even feel it was supposed to be scary except for the occasional cheap scare of someone jumping out of nowhere or the music suddenly appearing with enormous intensity.  It was just that that world was somehow different than ours - visually.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was terrific.  Bruce Willis has never been better.  For a while, I even stopped thinking that he was John McClane.  He was simply a child psychologist trying to help a troubled kid.  The kid, by the way, was fantastic.  He is possibly the best child actor/actress since Tatum O'Neil was in Paper Moon.  This kid should have been Anakin in the Phantom Menace instead of Jake ""Can't Act His Way Out Of A Paper Bag"" Lloyd; but I don't want to get into that.  This kid ran the gamut of emotions - fear, isolation, happiness, sadness, and confusion.  He is a better actor than most adults in the SAG.<br/><br/>I was also a fan of the ending.  That truly made the movie for me.  The writer must have gone to the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari school of screenwriting.  It was (POTENTIAL SPOILER) a brilliant plot twist - the best since The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, the movie really knew what to do with emotions. The audience can really feel for the mother.  She loved her son, but she didn't know what was going on with him.  She didn't know what she could do for him; I'm sure a lot of parents have felt that way.  Scratch that - I'm sure a lot of people have felt that way.  Not only can we feel for the mother, but I felt bad for the kid.  Quite frankly, his gift sucks; you can really feel for him.  Every major character in the film can evoke the pity of the viewer from Bruce Willis to the father of the dead girl.  Bottom line: Terrific writing - someone knows what their doing in Hollywood. <br/><br/>
It's about time!"

","I first sent in my IMDB comments on The Sixth Sense right after I saw it in September. We got the DVD version two weeks ago and have watched it twice again. For me, this movie gets better each time I see it.<br/><br/>The first time I didn't know what to expect and was truly surprised and stunned. The second time, knowing what was going to happen, I was able to see it from a different perspective.<br/><br/>After the second viewing we watched the DVD extras, including an interview with M. Night Shyamalan that addressed many questions that I've seen raised here in the IMDB comments, such as why it gets very cold in some scenes and not in others, the pointed use of the color red in certain scenes, etc. That allowed me to look at the movie a third time with yet another perspective.<br/><br/>I was able to appreciate the performances of the actors even more the second and third time around. Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were nothing short of brilliant in conveying exactly what they needed to convey. Toni Colette was marvelous (the scene in the car gets me misty-eyed every time). But Olivia Williams, as Willis' wife, had one of the toughest roles, which I didn't appreciate until I saw the movie for the second time.<br/><br/>When I read the User Comments from people who didn't like the movie, I wonder if they could possibly have seen the same movie I saw! I would highly recommmend watching the DVD version to see Shyamalan's comments, several excellent deleted scenes and lots of other goodies."

","Hello.  Yesterday I watched the Sixth Sense again, and I would like to share with you the impressions that this movie caused on me since the first time I saw it. I really enjoyed the Sixth Sense and believe that it has a very good plot and script, but, it didn't surprise me; since the moment I heard that the ending would surprise me, I knew that one of them was dead... It was logical.  In the 60's there was a movie with an ending like this, Carnival of Souls, so, I didn't see anything I haven't seen before. <br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment performance was superb.  And I must say that Bruce Willis' too.  It's a real pity that he has done so many bad movies before (Die Hard 1, 2, 3, etc)(Just keep out of this list Pulp Fiction, Last Man Standing and Twelve Monkeys) because The Academy seldom forgives... Probably he will receive an Oscar someday in 25 years... And Toni Collete, it is always nice to see her... Muriel's Wedding is one of my favorite movies... This movie was very good, but I can't say it is the best psichological thriller I have ever seen... That place still belongs to ""What ever happened to Baby Jane?""..."

","SPOILERS !!!!!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I have been reading some of the prior comments, and a little group of them kept me thinking about. I don't know if this is or not the best movie of 1999, but, as for me, IT WAS. The greatest I saw  (that year), for sure. Very intelligent. This is not `Vertigo' or  `Scream', Why to compare?  It's something totally different. Of course, people who is too busy confronting it with another films, searching clues or waiting for scarecrows, will hardly appreciate the GENUINE FRIGHTFUL situation of a child who is feeling totally alone in THIS world. The only people who take him serious, are all DEAD and angry. No one is there to take off his fear. Not even his mother can do anything, because of his silence and because she's got two jobs, no helping hand and a small son smarter than she. All the time you wonder if he is going to become into another Vincent Grey. THAT'S HORROR,  and that's drama. I wasn't so much smart: I didn't guess the end. Some people said it was obvious, I don't think so. I saw the movie on august '99 and i didn't heard much about it. Nobody persuaded me about a great ending, so i didn't was in speculator role. But because of that, I will hardly forget that moment. It's the best: to start to remember that overlooked clues once I have been scoffed. Better than feeling smarter than Shyamalan. I have neither found so much mistakes.: some guys are asking (banal) things<br/><br/>like: ` Why was Cole afraid of every ghost but Malcolm ?' `Why did every ghost appear in a form that showed how they died except Malcolm? They were all bloody and disfigured; why not Malcolm? Where was the bullet hole in his shirt and the blood?'<br/><br/>`(Clearly the biggest question is): why it was never cold when Malcolm was in the room (with lots of people)except in the very last scene with his wife?' Well, I couldn't say that those are mistakes: According to the film, a ghost is the denial of someone's own death. Cole explains that: `they don't know they're dead'.  But they're looking for Cole's help, because they have died with fright or anger, and estimating that they could die. Instead, Malcolm died with GUILT. He's desire of bring help to Cole, it's stronger than his need of help. He had never estimated his death, he didn't see the gun before than Vincent's shot. He don't know or don't care about the bullet hole, so he don't show it, he can't. (I suppose that a ghost must look like its own idea of it self) He's neither angry or MAD, so why it supposes to be cold before the end??? (or when he suspects about his wife, of course) And, after all, how can you be sure it wasn't cold? It's really necessary to show lots of people in shiver with the cold of one only ghost?? I mean, in the restaurant or in the theater. It would be stupid. On the other hand, Cole really needs someone trustworthy. After all, he is just a child, and Malcolm is not like a ghost supposes to be, so, even if he notice something, he is who has to believe what he want , in this case.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you remember their leave-taking, you can wonder how much did Cole really know about him.<br/><br/>Now, think about this: This has to be a great movie if people still talks about it this way. Still spends money and time on it (THIS WAY). Shyamalan is so very intelligent. He made a masterpiece of the late 90's. A turning point. He knows how to play with our mind (nicely) and, obviously, he knows what people wants. This is a simple but powerful story.<br/><br/>And, anything else: why all this prejudice about Bruce Willis? He's not a bad or less actor. He's really good doing he's part, what ever he play. This is a good performance, but is not his best. And neither a surprise. I must mention his `James Cole', in `12 monkeys', one of the best performances I saw, ever. That was a very dramatic and intricate role. It was something truly confuse and he made it really credible.<br/><br/>I don't like most of his movies, but it means nothing about him. He is really great anyway."

","Was I the only person on the face of the Earth who didn't succumb to the completely dumbed-down storyline of this movie?  I took a guess at what the ""big twist"" would be within maybe the first 5-10 minutes of this film, and for the next two hours, I had to sit and be forcibly spoon-fed every possible indication the my assumption was correct.  Yeah yeah, Haley Joel Osmont IS a very talented young actor, and I have no doubt he's going places... but I have never seen Bruce Willis have less range in character (as Malcolm) in any movie he's ever done.  He sits (or stands... either way, he never seems to move) for the entire duration of the film, looking haggard and hung over, whispering 90% of his dialogue, and speaking the remaining 10% in a dull monotone.  *yawn*<br/><br/>If I have to actually sit and think to myself during a movie about whether or not it will end the way I know it will, then I'm obviously not getting into it.  Osmont's character Cole was interesting, indeed, but the remaining characters, aside from Malcolm, had little if nothing to do with the plot other than to bolster our belief in the central character.  Once they get their screentime, they really didn't have to be there anymore, and so, why not introduce entirely unrelated characters and events to further the plot? The Sixth Sense's storyline does that in spades.<br/><br/>I find it VERY hard to believe that so many people are so lacking in their intelligence and/or attention span that they never picked up on what the ""big twist"" was until the end.  It couldn't have been more obviously spoon-fed if they just came out and told you what it was at the beginning. I don't feel that the resolution was effective either (I can't even remember a climax... unless that was the ""big twist""?).  It seemed to leave every question answered and little to question or remember the film by.<br/><br/>I was sincerely disappointed with The Sixth Sense.  I expected a fairly decent mystery/drama/ghost story with some intelligent, well-thought-out story development, and a good cast of characters.  Instead there is little intelligence needed by the viewer to enjoy the movie, and one good character to get interested in.

","Finally, I watched The Sixth Sense in April 2000 on the DVD I had purchased a week earlier. I had tried very hard to avoid any discussion of the movie (as I always do with any movie) until I had a chance to see it. The one thing I had heard (before I could change the TV channel) was that there was a ""big surprise"" at the end.<br/><br/>Now, I am an average guy, maybe a bit above average in education. And I will try not to give away the ""surprise"" here, in case you haven't seen the movie, yet. But the ""big surprise"" was obvious to me 17 minutes into the film. It was so obvious to me by the time it was ""revealed"" that I had thought, in a scene where the boy and the doc agree that their therapy is over, that both parties *already acknowledged* the surprise in that scene and were saying goodbye. At the time, I thought, with some admiration, ""This is a pretty subtle way to make that realization occur."" So imagine my confusion when a few minutes later we get the big, dramatic scene where one of the characters *finally* does realize what's what. I was in disbelief ... ""You mean he *didn't know*?"" I wondered.<br/><br/>I don't get it. ""The Crying Game"" had a ""big surprise"" that was obvious as soon as they showed the ""female"" character's face. And now this. Am I somehow amazingly intuitive or is everyone else slow? I mean, when you see the doc sitting in the boy's apartment across from the mother and *no one is talking* doesn't that give you a big clue? And the fact that earlier no one seemed irked at the loud conversation in the church? And once you realize that, and note similar instances as the movie progresses, isn't it obvious?<br/><br/>Perhaps because I saw no surprise, this movie seemed very slow to me. A lot of worried looks on the kid's face as he avoid various feelings or actual encounters with dead people. And very few interactions with the dead people. To me, the best scene by far was at the wake for the little girl who died. The movie should have had 2-3 additional examples like that, instead of a lot of peeking around corners by the boy.<br/><br/>Still, the actors did a very good job. For that reason alone I gave this movie a 5."

","What I liked: the performances are excellent, especially the actor playing the boy. He is totally convincing in every scene -- a true rarity for someone his age. He deserves watching. If his performance hadn't been true, the movie would have collapsed. I also liked some of the atmosphere and the basic premise of the film.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: the movie previews made this seem to be a scary ghost film. While it does have its moments, it is more of a mawkish soap opera about Willis' character. The story moves excruciatingly slowly. And one more thing that bothers me: the story was done years ago on an old TWILIGHT ZONE or ONE STEP BEYOND. Ironically, it was better in the original because they took only 1/2 hour or hour to tell the story, while here they drag it out to almost two hours.<br/><br/>It's an interesting psychological study, but as a ghost story it is just too sluggish."

First of all, how could anyone call this a horror movie, it's a psychological drama with only one or two scenes that could be described as -slightly- creepy. It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't do much to me, there's no thrills, no false scares, the few ghosts are all very tame and in my opinion the little kid was pretty annoying. The movie goes on and on in the same pace, doesn't have any real highlights, no memorable moments, and the end (though it was kinda interesting) wasn't the roaring climax i was secretly hoping for.

","THE SIXTH SENSE is a dramatic lesson in fear that borrows heavily from 19th-century literature (especially the stream-of-consciousness technique pioneered by Victorian writer Ambrose Bierce). A truly powerful masterpiece, it accomplishes its objective without gratuitous violence or gore and with only a little nudity and swearing. Yet the fear factor itself is raw and mesmerizing enough to scare you - if you allow yourself to be scared. Taking a break from playing the action hero is Bruce Willis, who portrays a child psychologist with a dark secret of which even he is unaware. Haley Joel Osment is a delightfully unconventional little boy who lives in a tent, speaks fluent Latin, and plays with toy soldiers in church. He also can communicate directly with ""dead people"" (i.e. ghosts). The movie juxtaposes the real world and the land of the dead in a casual manner that just adds to the suspense. And as I said before, it is all done very subtly and without a lot of sickening blood or violence. THE SIXTH SENSE will surely go down in history, along with PULP FICTION, BRAVEHEART, AMERICAN BEAUTY, and FARGO as one of the greatest films of the 1990s. So see this movie soon. It will terrify you - and restore your faith in the motion picture industry."

Bruce Willis is in his 'strong, silent type' mode, but that didn't bother me.<br/><br/>  The reason the film didn't deserve it's oscar nomination was because the film wasn't among the five best of the year.

","What's going on here?  The summer of 99 has produced 2 very intensely creepy films.  First Blair Witch takes us all by storm and now the Sixth Sense does the same thing.  What we have here is a film that does all the things that a ""horror"" film should do.  It uses shadows, it has talk of the dead and the undead and it even uses other things like atmosphere and music to produce a very good scary film, and one that will have you buzzing about the ending.<br/><br/>Young Cole can hear and see dead people and it is up to Dr. Malcolm to help him out.  The story itself is interesting and how it is carried out is even better.  But I have to say that I think this is a film that should be seen twice to figure everything out and to understand all that it is.  Because when you leave the theater you will question many aspects of the film.  You will wonder if it is legitimate in it's approach and honest and realistic with what the end of the film has wants us to believe.  But when I walked home and had a chance to examine it, I realized how truthful it is, and that makes it even more brilliant.  And in a way this film reminds me of a 1987 film called Angel Heart.  Both films concentrate on foreshadowing and they also play with our intellect.  When I first saw Angel Heart, I knew that it was good, but when I began to watch it more often on video, I realized that Angel Heart was a film that had more to it in every shot.  Every single time the camera rolled, there was always a subliminal meaning behind the ersatz one that was in front of us.  And that is what I think Sixth Sense does so well.  You wonder at first why Malcolm can't get into his basement, and then when you leave the theater and think about the film, you realize how much it all made sense.  This is a film that manipulates our psyche and plays with our ethos.  But it has a great time doing so.  I highly recommend this film, especially if you want to be frightened.  There are about five or six really good moments in the film that make your heart stop.  And on that level the film is terrific.  But as a film, not a genre piece, this is top notch and dare I say that Cole may be remembered at Oscar time.  Go see this film!"

","""The Sixth Sense"" is a schitzophrenic movie.  If you can make it through the first hour and 20 minutes of this one, it starts to pick up steam very very quickly.  The storyline consists of a psychologist's attempt to help a young boy with a terrifying problem.  He can see dead people.  These lost souls communicate with the boy on a constant basis, needing something.  Help? Revenge?  No one knows, until Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) enters the picture.  Dr. Crowe is fighting his own personal demons as a year before a patient with similiar symptoms to this boy reveals that Dr. Crowe failed to help him.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis puts his all into the role of Dr. Crowe, and you can watch his face grow more and more haggard and emotional as he realizes he may not be able to help this boy, especially as his life at home begins to deteriorate due to his efforts.  This has emerged as one of Bruce's best roles in recent times and will stand as a true sign that he has matured as an actor.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment stars as Cole, the young boy with the huge secret.  He is the real star of this movie, portraying the pain his character is suffering with an amazing dexterity and touch.  You feel this young man can really see ghosts, and react with his level of terror once we see them as well. The Academy went with longevity over the true best supporting actor this year, and I hope to see Haley Joel win the Oscar he richly deserves in the very near future.<br/><br/>Toni Collette is the only other real character in the movie, playing Cole's mother.  She comes off a bit dry for a mother struggling to understand and find a cure for what ails her son, but overall is a strong character and feels real enough.<br/><br/>There really is no supporting cast to speak of.  Malcolm's wife, Cole's teacher and the ghosts of the dead are the only real supporting characters in this one.  Filler mostly, although one dead soul has a bit more importance to the unfolding of the last half hour, and I wish I had caught her name.  <br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" was a sleeper hit, and I feel got as much overkill from media outlets as ""The Blair Witch Project"" did, and like TBWP got a major boost in its audience from that.  Is it a good movie?  The answer is yes, the last half hour (and it's rather stunning final plot twist) is strong enough to carry the weight of the rather lengthy and droll first hour.  Is it a thriller?  To some extent, but packs nowhere near the ""thrill"" of a ""Halloween"" or ""Silence of The Lambs"".<br/><br/>2 1/2 out of 5"

"FlickJunkie-2","7","0","0","13 April 2000"," Clever story with too many holes (SPOILER WARNING)
","THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS INCLUDING SPECIFIC REFERENCES THAT REVEAL THE ENDING.  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU SEE THE FILM BEFORE READING THIS COMMENT.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It seems most people fall into one of two camps on this film.  They either love it or hate it (it would seem that more love it).  My sentiments lie with neither camp.  This is a fascinating and clever story that is well filmed but poorly crafted.  Plot holes abound and Director/Writer M. Night Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a surprise.  In my comments here, I have commented many times on the dangers of writers directing their own work.  In almost every case, the director lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws.  In this case they were glaring.<br/><br/>Many questions come to mind.  Why was Cole (Haley Joel Osment) afraid of every ghost but Malcolm (Bruce Willis)?  Why did every ghost appear in a form that showed how they died except Malcolm?  They were all bloody and disfigured; why not Malcolm?  Where was the bullet hole in his shirt and the blood?  I watched the movie a second time and there were a number of scenes where he had no jacket.  He always wore the same shirt, but there was no bullet hole or blood in any scene.<br/><br/>Clearly the biggest question is why it was never cold when Malcolm was in the room except in the very last scene with his wife (Olivia Williams).  He was in scenes with Cole's mother (Toni Collette), a restaurant full of people, a theater full of parents, a doctor, and on and on and yet in no scene did anyone seem remotely chilly, no less seeing their breath.<br/><br/>So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a great motion picture. However, it was very well filmed from a technical standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the viewer engaged.<br/><br/>The acting was fair to excellent.  Toni Collette was mediocre at best as Cole's mother.  She overacted in almost every scene and her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he told her what her mother said.  Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me over as Malcolm's wife.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type.  He always comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts.  His forte is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his career by staying with those types of parts.<br/><br/>Finally, there is young Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  He gave an excellent performance and was the linchpin that held the whole film together.  He was very versatile in his portrayal of various emotions.  He handled fear, playfulness, affection and anger with equal aplomb.  His physiognomy was right for the part as well, as he looked very nerdy and self conscious, exactly what was needed for the part.<br/><br/>I rated this film a 7/10.  It was entertaining and it had real potential, but it had too many flaws to realize it."

","Oscar nominee,  Haley Joel Osment (Murphy Brown, Mixed Nuts, Forrest Gump) who started at a young age and has been under the best directors in the industry such as: Nora Ephron, Robert Zemeckis, etc., plays ""Cole Sear."" Way to go Haley!  He is not only cute and adorable but all his interviews are great. His answers are impressive and wise.  Did ""Forrest Gump"" Tom Hanks, teach you all those diplomatic answers? The movie is excellent. The cast if great. My favorite Bruce Willis part (Twelve Monkeys, Nobody's Fool) in a long time as ""Malcolm Crowe,""  the children's psychiatrist who has to deal with a boy who is paralyzed by fear because he lives in a world of ghosts and sees dead people. No mystery there! It is hard not to give away the plot. You must see the movie.<br/><br/>I tend to stay away from movies that have too much violence, and made a vow with myself that I would not watch any movie that brought fear to my mind. The Sixth Sense did not. I have great respect for the voting process done by IMDb. The movie is 22 on the 250 list, so I had to see it. Actually I am going to get the tape. The makers of the movie kept giving away clues but people don't get them. It is an outstanding movie. I highly recommend it. This is definitely a ten. Clever!  If you are like me and don't like gory movies, this movie is not gory. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It is just the best! My husband liked it so much that he finished watching it and rewound the tape and watched it again.  Amazing! Favorite Scenes: The boy seeking refuge in a church from the mean guys.

","I was quite surprised with this debut effort from Shalyman. The actors who were excellently cast in their roles(the mother, the son, and the psychologist) do a more than adequate job with the chilling tale. Shalyman himself does a great job of slowly unveiling the terrifying world inhabited by the dearly departed and the movie really draws you in effectively. The scenes in which the horrors seen by the boy are left up to the imagination create the most memorable shivers. While not an entirely original plot through and through (the scene in which Willis' character hears barely distinguishable voices on an audio tape undoubtedly came from the novel ""Legion"" by William Peter Blatty)""The Sixth Sense"" makes for a good old fashioned scare. My only contention is the ""surprise"" ending as I thought it was totally telegraphed early on."

He has succeeded in making a modern ""horror film"" without resorting to gore and CGI. This is a ghost story in league with The (original)Haunting (1963), The Uninvited, The Changeling, etc. It relies almost solely on the power of the actors to render its chills. There are still some genuine jolts--my wife practically broke my arm at one point as a mysterious figure swished by the lens. Bruce Willis is his most un-Bruce like, and he's great: soft spoken, gentle, emotional. Haley Joel Osment is the real thing--not a ""child actor"" but a warm, human, frightened little boy.

Bruce Willis, an underrated actor in my opinion, did a hell of a job playing the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe who helps a boy, played also greatly by Haley Joel Osment, who sees dead people.

"Clayton Hanson","Null","0","0","7 April 2000"," Interesting film, but is it truly deserving of the praise heaped upon it? *Some spoilers*
","I saw this on video the first week it was released.  My first impression was, ""Wow, that was good.""  Then, I began to think a little bit and more and more holes became apparent.<br/><br/>First, consider the score.  While praised by a number of the other reviewers, and it was effective, it often slipped into ham-handedness, especially whenever a 'scary looking' ghost was going to appear.  I realized how thoroughly the score was manipulating the audience only upon reflection.<br/><br/>Second, the dialogue was very stilted and it is credit to Willis, who can indeed act, and to Osment that they were able to convey any emotions whatsoever.  Further, Osment should have gotten the Academy Award for being able to handle such awkward lines and still convince the audience that he was a real child.<br/><br/>Third, did that ending suck or what?  I'm surprised that more people didn't see the plot twist coming, since it was thoroughly obvious from the behavior of Willis by the middle of the movie (i.e.  Why wasn't he having conversations with anyone except Osment?).  Actually, I didn't even know there was going to be a plot twist of any sort going into the movie, having not paid much attention to buzz and talk about the movie.  Further, the flashback and flashback montage revealing 'what really happened' could have been cut entirely, unless the director thought the audience was so stupid that it wouldn't get the previous five minutes and the blood on Willis. Well, maybe audiences are that stupid.<br/><br/>On a more upbeat note, the cinematography was really very good, and showed a very fine attention to detail, especially the sweaty palms scene.  The only quibble I had was with the lingering shots of Philadelphia landmarks. While they certainly occasionally helped highlight the eerie mood, they weren't always on par with the quality of other shots.  Anyhow, still above average there.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, great acting (considering the limitations of the principals), fine cinematography, and an interesting story hampered by manipulative music, bad dialogue and five minutes of ending that could have been cut.  Still 7/10."

Upon second viewing, I concentrated more on the relationships between the characters, especially between Cole and Malcom, and found it to be a more satisfying experience. The final scenes between Cole and his mother, and then Malcom and his wife (don't worry, I didn't give the surprise away) were one of the most moving and poignant scenes I've seen. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense, like The Green Mile, is a touching emotional drama, with a hint of the supernatural.

I'm firmly convinced that Willis is incapable of breaking out of his dull monotone, and although Osment was fairly good, several of his scenes left me with my eyes rolling. The dialog for the most part was howlingly stilted, but provided for plenty of laughs.  The supposed suprise ending was nothing of the sort, and left me thinking ""yeah, so what?""  I'm sure Shayamalan is in love with his home town, but the way he presents it is dull and uninspired and makes it look about as fun to live in as the town I'm in.  Also I can't figure out why people watch this ten times in a row.  I saw it once, got the plot (?!?!) and feel no need, or desire, to watch it again.  Every now and then a majorly hyped movie lives up to it's expectations, but this one left me with one thought: ""thank God it didn't win Best Picture"".

My husband and I had a discussion afterwards where he wondered why I couldn't just relax and enjoy the movie...my response was that I was shown that it was a movie far too often. In other words, I was constantly struck by the cinema photography and ""clues"" (red doorknob, etc.) too many times to completely lose myself in the plot. I'm sure that most people are far more relaxed about these things and that I am unnecessarily anal, but when I watch a movie I want to be lost completely in it, not looking at; ""Gee, what a clever Director I am! Look at my subdued earth tones! Look at my yellow filters and shadows!"". Hitchcock did it well, so you lost yourself in the plot, and in fact this Director gave a bow to Hitchcock in the spiral staircase scene. But Hitchcock was an old master, and this is a fresh young Director, so I would imagine that as he progresses, his movies will become masters as well. All in all I found it mildly enjoyable, with the plot being the best part. If it had been done with less pretentiousness, it would have been perfect."

Beyond that, the director makes some interesting efforts at being stylish, but this too was partly ruined for me by his own somewhat pretentious `Tricks and Clues' commentary at the end of the video. As for the acting, Bruce was good but much more interesting in Twelve Monkeys and Haley has been overhyped if not overrated.

","In my experience, there are two kinds of movie trailers: Trailers that take a bad movie and make it look good, and trailers that take a good movie and make it look bad. The Sixth Sense is of the latter category. I saw the trailers, thought it looked stupid - not just because of the presence of Bruce Willis, but just because it didn't look interesting. Then it started getting critical raves, and I figured ""what the hell, I'll give it a shot"". Boy am I glad I did.<br/><br/>I only have one major major problem with the film: The ending. I have an uncanny ability to sniff out twist endings from a mile away (""The Usual Suspects"" didn't fool me for a second) and this one's no different. Okay, I'll admit I had the ending spoiled for me ) but even if I hadn't, the ""subtle"" clues are so blatantly obvious I'm surpised no one else got it...it seems to me like the first time you see Willis and Cole's mom sitting together (like 10 minutes into the film), it should be a simple matter of connecting the dots. And another thing: I wouldn't mind if the twist took up maybe one slightly enigmatic shot. But instead they have to spend like 5 minutes showing us flashbacks, sound bites, etc. etc... Frankly, I thought it was a bit of an insult to my intelligence. But the director (sorry I can't remember his last name) seems like a very smart guy, and I keep having images of him arguing with studio executives, telling him ""Oh, you have to add so and so, make it more obvious..."" and he finally caves in and does it.<br/><br/>But that doesn't matter, because the rest of the film is fantastic. It had a few really really scary parts (the sick girl comes to mind) but it wasn't ""terrifying"" like everyone says. Blair Witch kept me up a lot more. But it's a very intelligent film, with a good script, creepy score, and kind of understated direction (which is a good thing). What really pulls it all together are the performances: Bruce Willis is genuinely good. He still tends to be a little monotonous, but he shows a lot more emotion and range than, say, Die Hard. Toni Collette was excellent as well. But little Haley Joel Osment...wow! I am truly in awe of his performance. I still think the Supporting Actor category should've been his by a long shot. It would be an amazing performance by an adult, but to come out of an 11-year old boy...wow! The scene towards the end of him and his mom in the car truly had me choking up. And the creepiest scene in the movie doesn't even involve ghosts: it's simply Haley Joel's monologue in the hospital bed about seeing dead people. The expression on his face, his barely-a-whisper delivery, the faintest hints of tears at the corners of his eyes...it sent shivers up my spine, and trailer clips simply do not do the scene justice.<br/><br/>All in all a great movie. American Beauty was the only best picture nominee that actually deserved to be nominated in the first place. Cider House Rules? Come on...I could make a list of better movies from 1999, but I won't. One of the best of the year, but not in the top 5."

It was okay, but definitely not what I expected.  The trailers portrayed this film as if the majority of it consisted of Cole Sear being frightened and cajoled by ghosts (one example is the scene between Cole and the poisoned girl in her bedroom.  Commercials seemed to imply she was chasing him).  This was not so.  Instead, he didn't reveal his ""secret"" to his psychiatrist until the movie was halfway over.  Even though ""I see dead people"" was the most overplayed line in the commercials, the movie left me under the impression that the audience wasn't supposed to know.  As for the twist, any sharp and clever person can figure it out prior to its revelation.  I am not one of these people, so it was surprising for me.<br/><br/>I guess I just expected this movie to be more terrifying than it really was. I thought the twist would be of the frightening, makes-you-jump variety.<br/><br/>Also, there were some forgivable but annoying holes in the plot, as other people have mentioned.  The one unforgivable element was Bruce Willis.  He was expressionless, and this dragged the movie down (like the scene where Cole's ""secret"" was revealed, ugh!).  Haley Joel Osment's performance, however, was incredible.  He deserved the Oscar.  He'll probably get one later, the same way Whoopi Goldberg was passed over for The Color Purple but got one for Ghost, instead.<br/><br/>All in all, a worthwhile movie to see.

I was also confused about so much effort being put into establishing the presence of spirits in the child's apartment, but when the plot was expanded to him 'listening' to them he instead seeks out another, entirely new character. What did the battered wife or the suicidal boy have to say, and other than to jump out and go ""Boo!"" what purpose did they serve?<br/><br/>It is still an entertaining, well made, and worthwhile film, but highly overrated."

"Spleen","8","0","0","26 March 2000"," About the `surprise' ...
","... I'm afraid I got it almost immediately - that is to say, about a third of the way through.  I mean, Shyamalan drops us a pretty broad hint.  I wonder if he even intended to keep the secret hidden.  I have a suspicion...  I think that Shyamalan's intention was to reveal the secret at precisely the moment I worked it out, possibly by dropping an even broader hint.  But then someone at some preliminary screening failed to get the hint, and Shyamalan thought: `Well, if it's THAT easy to keep people in the dark ...'<br/><br/>I'm reminded of `Vertigo', where Hitchcock does something similar: he makes his revelation less than half way through, as soon as he decently can (to the audience, of course; not to the central character).  It must be said that this makes `Vertigo' a better, tenser film.  An explicit revelation halfway through would have likewise made `The Sixth Sense' a better, tenser film; so I'm GLAD I worked things out early on - a friend of mine who didn't found the story a little humdrum, before the conclusion.<br/><br/>I don't know that I would have had THAT reaction: even given Shyamalan's miscalculation, this is a beautifully told tale, supported by three perfectly judged performances (Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, who proves that it IS possible for an adult story to have a likeable child as a central character, and Toni Collette - but I'm always ready to rave about her, wherever she appears).  The criticism that the ghosts intrude on what could have been a good domestic drama is entirely misguided.  This is a story ABOUT ghosts intruding.  I found it refreshing to see a fantasy that takes its fantastic premise seriously, without using it as an excuse to cheapen the drama.<br/><br/>The sober photography helps a good deal, without drawing attention to itself.  A pity that one of the shots was so obviously swiped from `Poltergeist'.  Not that I minded - this is a much better film than `Poltergeist', anyway."

","This is a very good film, featuring an incredible performance by Osment and a strong reminder of what a fine actor Willis can be when he's got a good script. But while I certainly don't wish to jeopardize my membership by revealing the end (said by many to rival ""Usual Suspects""), it simply doesn't warrant the incredible attention it's received (including its Best Picture nomination), and, to my own surprise, undoes any strides it makes towards being a human story rather than a ghost story. For this is really a movie about how being a kid in today's world is tougher than it's ever been. This could have been a much darker, better film, but Disney clearly reigned it in from any steps into R-rating territory. (It's PG-13.) Hopefully its success will allow Shymalan freer rein on his next film: he's capable of it, as the ""Munchausen revelation"" will attest."

","I went to see this movie for one reason; the advertised subject matter alone would not have been enough to coax me into driving to the theatre. When I noticed that Haley Osment had a lead role (or, technically, a ""supporting"" role, but I don't buy that-- he is the lead in this one), I knew it was something to check out.  I recalled seeing him several years younger in that shortly-lived sitcom ""Thunder Alley"" with Jonathan Winters, and I remember having had the distinct impression that he had talent, and that I should keep an eye out for him in the future.  I saw this movie very early following its release, well before word had really spread about how great his performance was, so I can honestly say other peoples' opinions had no influence on my perception.  Anyway, I came out of the theatre thinking this kid was truly brilliant, in a role very difficult for most child actors to pull off even well.  I felt, and still feel, that Haley's performance-- and only his-- made this movie first class.  At the time, I thought he should get an Oscar, but I never thought he stood a chance.  I'm glad others have noticed him in this one."

","I hadn't seen the trailer and don't care much for Bruce Willis, so it wasn't until this last weekend (and a slew of Oscar nominations) that I plunked down matinee money to see The Sixth Sense.  I knew there was some Big Secret Twist and the tag line (""I see dead people""), but that was all I knew.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, I've got to say that pretty soon into the movie I had figured out the twist, and I thought it was so obvious that I assumed there must be something more; halfway into the movie I realized, nope -- the writer director is saving this up for his big revelation.  That was a letdown.<br/><br/>Dispensing with that, I thought this was a decent enough movie.  The character study made this probably the most mellow suspense movie I've ever seen, but that was fine.  The movie rightly lets its emphasis fall on the young boy who is far more interesting than his doctor, but this also leaves one of the holes large enough to drive a truck through: the disintegration of the doctor's marriage so quickly after being shot is presented as an incongruous ""given;"" that was my immediate tip off that there was only one explanation.  The movie also plays a little coy with its supernatural rules (""they can only see what they want"") so that the dead can move a physical object (a coin, videocassette box, a piece of jewelry) but then, maybe not (the desk barring the door).<br/><br/>The main reasons I decided to see the movie were 1) check out Haley's performance and 2) there's just not much else out there right now.  All of the performances in the film are good, but Haley Joel Osmet and Toni Collette, as the boy's mother, have a couple of scenes together which are terrific.  Neither one gets to exhibit a great deal of range -- not their fault; it's written into their parts -- but they more than make due with what they're handed.  Osmet and Collette's final scene together in the car is absolutely fantastic, wrenching stuff.<br/><br/>A side note: Osmet is in far too many scenes to be considered a supporting actor. Perhaps that's just my perception because I was quite interested in his character and predicament, but as I think back, he still seems to have about equal screen time with Willis.  I haven't noticed that anyone else picked up on this, though."

His portrayal of Dr. Malcolm Crowe is wonderful and convincing.

","If you haven't seen the movie and would like to without any plot points revealed stop reading right now.  I'd also advise you to see the movie before you read any other reviews for that matter.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is one of the best thrillers in recent years.  I didn't find it scary in the least, but the movie was so well made it blows most of the competition out of the water.  There are two areas in which it excels: acting and direction.  The acting is first rate.  And its not the flashing kind of Al Pacino acting that gets all the attention either--just quiet, powerful understated performances from Willis, Osment and Collette that make you believe everything you see on the screen.  Shaymalan's direction is fabulous, especially during the ""ghost scenes"" in which he has the ghosts move at the corners of the frame without focusing directly on them.  Its a nice break from the shot-for-shot slasher film clones that we're getting so much of these days.<br/><br/>Of course, then there's the ending.  As soon as I heard that there was a suprise ending I said to myself ""Hey, Bruce Willis is going to be a ghost."" Given rules for ghosts set up in the films I knew Bruce Willis would only interact with the kid.  And as scene by scene went by I was proven right (even through some clever direction to force assumnptions upon the viewer--such as the anniversary scene).  So the ending came as no surprise to me, but even without the third act's dramatic revelation, I found myself captivated by the movie.  Definately one of 1999's best surprises."

","There are two kinds of great genre film. The first is the sort that exemplifies the conventions of the genre, while respecting the genre's limits.

The greatness of The Sixth Sense-and I firmly believe that it is one of the handful of films from last year that can be classified as truly great-lies precisely in how it transcends its genre.The Sixth Sense resonates with Hawthornesque tonalities. It echoes Melville, Poe and Henry James ( I refer to James' great ghost stories, not his often tedious ""novels of manners"").The critics who saw only only a creepy, dull story with a twist at the end missed entirely the films extraordinary religious symbolism. The Bruce Willis Character is a soul in limbo, waiting to be saved. The instrument of salvation? A frightened, yet preternaturally gifted, child.Not a single performance in the film hit a false note..this is an extraordinary film about parents and children, about husbands and wives, and about life and death.

And for those who say that they saw it coming, I say 'no way!' because there is absolutely no way one could predict the ending to this movie unless he or she was the unfortunate one who heard it from a friend or read a spoiler somewhere.<br/><br/>The script was superbly written (by M. Night Shyamalan), and the cast is great. The acting was magnificent, even though you might hear otherwise now that the movie received so much praise. For some reason, people like to place negative comments about a movie that had great success; my guess is that it's because they like to be different from everybody else. This IS a great movie, believe me.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of horror movies. This kind (dealing with the supernatural and the fear of the unknown), and the slasher kind (where a mentally ill and/or deformed in some way person or creature goes out and massacres teenagers). The first kind mentioned is my favorite type and that's why I grade The Sixth Sense so high, it's simply original and well thought out.<br/><br/>Cole Sear is played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment and Malcolm Crowe was also fabulously played by Bruce Willis. M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job directing and I look forward to his future films.<br/><br/>The music score, written by James Newton Howard, delivers the appropriate mood and builds the suspense. A great score. I love the camera movements also.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this movie as much as I did, I would also strongly recommend you to see THE STIR OF ECHOES with Kevin Bacon, directed by Devid Coepp."

","I didn't expect The Sixth Sense to be nominated for an oscar, since horror is so often overlooked, and since Hitchcock is gone, there just aren't that many good horror movies around anymore.  This film surprised me. I was glued to my seat through the whole thing. Not normally a big Bruce Willis fan, I thought he did a great job. Now I don't know that I would have chosen it for an Oscar, but when I discovered it was nominated, I got a small tingle of satisfaction that it made it. This was a clever movie, suspenseful, perplexing at times, but all coming together in the end in a flash of insight.  I enjoyed it completely and recommend it to anyone who loves a good ghost story."

"Netboy67","9","0","0","8 August 1999"," Surprise Thriller of the Summer
","The Sixth Sense is the surprise thriller of the summer. Not as hyped as the other `scary' movies released this summer, it ends up being scarier and better. The Sixth Sense is not juts a scary movie, it is a psychological thriller. It is a work of art. It is compassionate and appealing and takes over your senses in a slow hypnotic way. Not what you would expect from a movie that has Bruce Willis listed as the main star. Fortunately, this movie is in no way like other Bruce Willis films.<br/><br/>I will tell you a little about the story, which is ideally all you need to know prior to seeing the film, just a little. Bruce Willis is Malcolm Crowe, an award winning psychiatrist whom almost a year after a traumatizing event takes on a boy with similar problems of another boy he tried to help but could not. Haley Joel Osment plays Cole, the little boy who is deeply troubled and withdrawn no one knows why. Except, of course, for us, who already know from the ads and commercials for this film that he `sees dead people'. Cole lives with his divorced mother, played by Lynn Collette.<br/><br/>Director M. Night Shyamalan has directed this movie in a quiet slow Hitchcockian way that works to its benefit, especially amidst complaints that the film drags. It is a very carefully weaved story that creates an interest that compels you to watch every part. The acting is excellent, particularly that of Haley Joel Osment. His painful and anguished expressions from the terror he feels just tear into your heart. The strained relationship between the scared boy and his single, loving and caring mother is also touching as well. Willis is great as the sad, concerned, and frustrated psychologist, bent on saving the boy, so that he may save his career and his marriage. The dark twists and the commentaries on death and loss make this movie extremely touching and there are scenes in which there are very few dry eyes in the theater, something not expected from a horror/ thriller. And this movie does not over do it in its horror; it remains classy and subtle, yet shocking. You will jump in your seat at least twice, which is once more than I did at The Haunting.<br/><br/>This movie is slow at first, but it builds up a great story, superb acting, good scares, and pulls at the heartstrings when you least expect it. The ending is an all out shocker, and makes the movie. I will not predict Oscars for this film, but I will say it is definitely the best movie of the Summer Film Season, and one of the best movies of the year. Definitely one of my Top Ten movies of all time. Give it a shot."
"whiteraven-4","9","0","0","24 February 2000"," Dramatic intrigue with a twist.
","From the beginning ""The Sixth Sense"" develops fascinating little crooks and twists for viewers who are on their toes.  The film rolls along in an almost dreamlike state meant to lull the audience into believing the entire story is quite normal, average and almost everyday.  Then it slaps them in the face.  As the characters begin to recognize their problems and deal with them, one might guess the story would lose its momentum.  However, this is the point where new plot details surface and old ones get a quick kick in the pants.<br/><br/>I'd say the film is a veritable jigsaw.  The audience may not find putting it together the most pulse-pounding and energetic trip of their viewing lives.  Yet the puzzle draws them in and engages their involvement.  And it does have hair-raising moments in spite of its lack of kick-butt action.<br/><br/>In summary:  good plot, good director, good actors, and great ending (among the ranks of ""Casablanca"")."

"mjukr","8","0","0","8 August 1999"," A Chilling Horror Tale with A Thrilling Plot
","In an industry awash with cheesy horror flicks and unthrilling thrillers, few dare attempt combining the two genres, and even fewer succeed.  But The Sixth Sense daresand succeeds.  The film never succumbs to the pitfalls of either genre; at no point does the dialogue prove dense or the acting plastic.  Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Wide Awake), The Sixth Sense is both bone-chillingly frightening and touching and maintains composure throughout.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crane, a confident child psychologist who has recently received a reward for his dedication to the field.  On the evening he and his wife (played by Olivia Williams, Rushmore) are celebrating the honor, a former patient (played by a well-disguised Donnie Wahlberg) of Crowe's breaks into his home.  After an emotional, catatonic outburst in which he condemns Crowe for being unable to heal his emotional pain, the patient pulls a gun.  Crowe is shot.  Without further explanation, the film moves forward to ""The Next Fall"" (as a subtitle reads).  Quickly, we realize that Crowe has changed.  Distraught over the failure to help his former patient, Crowe is eager to take on a young boy named Cole Sear, (played by Haley Joel Osment) who exhibits similar symptoms, in hopes of reclaiming faith in his abilities.  Although Cole initially feels that Crowe is incapable of providing a solution, he eventually accepts the doctor's open hand.  As their relationship grows, Cole, who is rejected by his classmates and is even called a freak by his own teacher, gradually feels comfortable enough to reveal his secret: he sees dead people, everywhere and all the time.  Although Willis refutes the idea of otherworldly communication, he is determined to aid the boy.  <br/><br/>Crowe's study progresses, and we see just how capable Willis is of performing serious roles.  He adeptly portrays a man torn between his urgency to repair the failures of his past and the need to restore his crumbling marriage (caused by the very dedication to his work for which he was rewarded), all with an odd, melancholic irk that fits the character completely.  The real star of the feature; however, is Haley Joel Osment, whose precocious acting is honest, centered, and convincing-qualities rarely seen or expecting from children his age. Osment truly convinced me that he was a child tortured by the ghastly apparitions of the dead and by his vicious, cold-hearted peers who issue constant torment.  Looking back on the film, I'm honestly not sure what would be worse-seeing the dead or being completely shunned by the living.  Nonetheless, Osment's skill is evinced in every petrified facial expression, in every cringe of anguish, and in every eye that wells with tear.  I'm anxious to see what the future holds for this bright star.<br/><br/>The analogy between the struggles of Crowe (torn between his work and his personal life) and Cole (tormented by both the living and the dead) constructs the framework that supports their relationship, and is the crux of the film's story (which becomes clearer near the film's end).  Shymalan juggles both central characters along with the impressive supporting cast, and he maintains firm control of every one, even though the story falters slightly at times. <br/><br/>But let us not forget the other strength of this film: it is creepy, and it will make you jump from the securityof your seat.  Although the gore feels excessive for a PG-13 rating and often seems present only to act as a crutch for the film's snail-like pace, it is quite effective at coercing the hair from one's neck and the warmth from one's skin.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense succeeds in frightening its audience.  But, more importantly, the film achieves the lofty goal of presenting a solid, thrilling story about the struggles between life and death, overshadowed by a strong message of compassion and acceptance.   <br/><br/>If you seek a scare with a good story to support it, The Sixth Sense will provide, and the ending will truly blindside you (it's quite a surprise, and it doesn't leave any plot holes that allow arguments along the lines of ""that could have never happened if"").  And if you're anything like me, this film will haunt you for days, creeping its way back into your mind like a slow tide on a darkened beach."
"Jason O","Null","0","0","17 February 2000"," Sheer Magnificence
","This is a truly amazing film. I was blessed with the fact that I had heard little about it and knew little of what to expect. This is, I believe, the best way to see a film. So by reading this, you're going to be more prepared than I was. I will, then, be careful.<br/><br/>If you think of child actors, perhaps Macaulay Culkin springs to mind in a wash of horror. Whilst Jake Lloyd did an admirable performance as young Anakin in The Phantom Menace, the role did not offer enough substance to truly test him as an adult actor.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment, however, is nothing short of brilliant. In a role that would test the most experienced actors, he draws the audience into the film in a way that defies belief. Although not at the top of the cast list, due to seniority and experience, had he been older, he could have out-billed Willis.<br/><br/>Having said that, the performances from all four of the key players is truly remarkable. The story centres around Osment's character, a child of divorced parents who can communicate with the dead. Willis is his child psychologist and the interplay between the two is awesome. Collette and Williams play the child's mother and Willis' wife respectively. The former gives a truly empathic performance of a single mother with a problem child, and the latter is perfect as the wife of a loner with their relationship in tatters.<br/><br/>Another player that should not go amiss is director Shyamalan, who also stars in a cameo role as Osment's doctor. The pace of the film makes us at one with the characters, and because the film altricates sharply between horror (in the slow-moving, chilling vein of The Exorcist) and sorrow (it is perhaps the most moving film of this decade) we become utterly helpless. It reaches out to you in a way that giants such as Titanic simply fail to do. There is also some incredible photography, under the watchful eye of legendary D.P. Tak Fujimoto.<br/><br/>A wonderful film, or even experience, even for die-hard action lovers. I saw grown men moved by this, and the women in the audience didn't stand a chance! Watch out for the Oscars, because Osment and Shyamalan (whose next film Unbreakable is expected to be just as good) should both receive nominations. If they don't there is something seriously wrong with Hollywood these days."

","This film is just that. It's very competently put together, and certainly has an interesting premise, but it's let down by a few minor flaws.<br/><br/>The cinematography is at times clumsy, and at others, over elaborate. I got the feeling that they were trying to achieve so much here that they got really carried away with it.<br/><br/>The child's dialogue, whist undeniably powerful (and *so* well delivered) is utterly inapporpriate. No children of that age talk like that. The only writer around at the moment who seems to be capable of producing good dialogue is Tarantino - and he is only prepared to look at one very specialised area. Bring back David Mamet!<br/><br/>At times the dialogue is far too expositional. I felt patronised by the film. Lines like ""You used the S-word"" are really unneccessary.<br/><br/>Finally, there was the occasional ham-fisted attempt at emotional manitpulation. The perfect example is the child's final scene in the car. I didn't feel convinced by the characters there at all. It just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>All those criticisms aside, the film is still very good. I would certainly recommend watching it. Only if you can't get in to see American Beauty, though."

But, the ending, although a great and beautiful one, is not the best thing about this movie, nor is it a good reason to see it.  For my money, the reason The Sixth Sense is so good and so respected stems from the atmosphere that it creates.  This is a quiet, meditative movie - one that draws you into its core and actually fosters that ""wow"" sensation that movies are supposed to create (most don't, if you ask me).  The acting is superb in its subtlety - not just in the case of Willis and Osment but also supporting players Williams and Collette.  Of course, Shyamalan's excellent script and direction don't hurt the movie either.<br/><br/>If you figure out the ending early on, don't worry about it.

","Caution -- contains spoilers<br/><br/>
Suspense?  What suspense?  The twists are so predictable and the plot so thin that it almost seemed that the script was nothing but an outline for a bad episode of the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.   In the last part of the film I half expected the ghost of Rod Serling to appear and say 'Been there, Done that'.  The so-called twist at the end is easy to predict and is something that would happen in a script written by fifth graders to scare each other in summer camp.   The characters are trite to the point that Mr. Shyamalan should pay royalties to other filmmakers.<br/><br/>A new hyped ?Genius? has been anointed.  This movie puzzled me because of the hype around it.  The question is how such a sub-standard movie can become such a hit with audiences and critics.  Is the quality of the product from the studios so bad that this predictable, hackneyed film can be considered art?  Apparently so because most the votes here on IMDB are way above 7.<br/><br/>The acting is a mixed bag of okay to really bad.  Mr. Willis can act and has in such films as The Kid, The Fifth Element, and The Story of Us, not to mention Moonlighting but in this film and the other waste of film stock Unbreakable his talent was not needed.  I kept wondering during this film if Mr. Willis?s performance was so stiff because he thought he should play dead through the whole film or if perhaps acting with such a bad kid actor as Mr. Osment caused massive boredom.  Ms. Williams is pretty but underutilized in this film.  Ms. Collette can also act but again she had to act in scenes with Mr. Osment.  This kid was really bad in this film with zero charm or screen charisma and even worse in AI.  I kept waiting for his charactor to be killed in a really gruesome manner to add some sort of emotional spark to the movie.  If Mr. Osment wants to stay in the business perhaps some acting lessons would help but it?s doubtfull.<br/><br/>Rated 1 out of 10.  Don't lose 2 hours of your life to this movie.<br/><br/>
For real suspense and great acting from everyone try Blood Simple from the Coen brothers.  It will really surprise even the most jaded movie fan."

Osment did a good job though as a small kid having to deal with seeing dead people. When it comes to Bruce Willis, any role that doesn't include a gun, grenade, or explosion is beyond him. I warn you, do not contribute money to this film in any way, shape, or form, as it only encourages more new filmmakers to produce this kind of drivel. If you still feel the need to see this, drive over to your friend's, and do not chip in for the pay-per-view.

Bruce Willis did much in this drama as the psychologist trying to help Haley Joel's character, which shows a rather different approach than him killing bad guys as John McClain.<br/><br/>My complaint had to be the infamous ending where when i saw it in theater, I recognized immediately that Shyamlan took the idea of an episode from the Nickelodeon show ""Are you afraid of the Dark?"" called The Tale of the Dream Girl using the same premise. Yet, the director got a nomination for original screenplay that he never mentioned his so called ""Inspiration"" to anybody.<br/><br/>Haley, don't stop acting in dramatic movies; M. Night, don't based your movies on TV plots next time."

","What can I say... Points for Bruce Willis. Points for Haley Joel Osment. Negative points for insufferable auteur M. Night Shyamalan. Bad dialog, poor pacing.

Night Shyamalan's work, you might like this as well. The only thing on his resume which would recommend him to me is as the writer of ""Stuart Little"" - and even that was hardly world-class!<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you like the works of directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanly Kubrick, Mimi Leder, or Joe Dante as I do, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a pretty poor waste of a couple of hours of your life."

Even still the twist at the end, did not live up to it's hype and was not as good as movies like ""The Usual Suspects"". I am a fan of Bruce Willis and he has his moments in this one, but I for one cannot stand Haley Joel. I believe his best movie was Forrest Gump and thats because he had few lines and was in 5% of the movie. I am not saying that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a terrible movie, but it does not live up to it's hype and certainly not to the IMDb top 100 rating. It was a very uneventful flick with boring dialogue and a very dry plot. To put it bluntly it bored me to tears. After weeks of hearing praise and worship after the viewing I was severely disappointed. The ending was good, but the rest of the movie was just average. If you want to see a good M. Night movie, watch ""Unbreakable"", I think ""Signs"" was just as overrated. All in all I gave this movie a 6/10 or maybe a B-.

He is THE reason the film works as well as it does and I wish the Oscar folks had given him some sort of special award to honor his great work. And, in addition, I can't believe I am saying this, but Bruce Willis and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, were at the top of their game as well. The other huge star here is the writing--and it was superb because it was so original, creative and the story bears many repeated viewings as each one reveals yet another layer of complexity.<br/><br/>By the way, while nominated for six Oscars, the movie somehow won none. Instead, the darkly cynical ""American Beauty"" carried off five of the trophies--though I really didn't think this winner was nearly as good a movie.

"ivanmessimilos","10","1","2","21 April 2020"," Perfect movie
","Bruce Willis interprets the lead, uncharacteristic of him as playing a child psychiatrist and I think he did a great job, ie I believed he was a psychiatrist, not a sweaty bloody character who would just break the drug chain after numerous explosions and loud shootings, hence the role he specializes. He wants to help the boy Cole, who has his secrets and inner demons, as he reminds him of one past patient he failed to help.
If Willis did a great job, what about young Haley Joel Osment? Little was devastated in his role, which even earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. To this day, this role remains one of the best, if not the best, children's role on the big screen. Osment already auditioned for the role because he was wearing a tie and when the director asked him if he had read his role, he said that he had read it three times and that was the whole scenario. He was so ready. We can clearly see the seriousness of his character through dialogues with Willis, but also with his mother, played (supremely) by Tony Collette. Such mature acting is not easy to find with many older actors, let alone with (then) nine-year-old Osment.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the way this movie was directed, every detail is important, there is no long or unnecessary scene because everything has its meaning. If there was a question or confusion, in the end everything was explained, everything is connected. I also see the quality in that when we first watch it, we have it and when we watch it again, we get a different perspective because the movie contains one of the biggest and most unpredictable twists, and yet that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie again. What is even more impressive is that the film continually casts clues as to what it really is, but your eyes and brain do not allow you to see or understand it. And when that moment comes when the light comes on in your head, you'll be surprised you couldn't see something that was constantly on your eyes.
The use of colors was not in vain, especially the red that appears in prominent and important scenes, but I couldn't see it at first glance.
I don't want to give out anything about the store, even though I know the vast majority of people have watched this movie, but I still don't want to ruin anyone's first impression of such a great movie.
We can only watch movies for the first time once. As stupid as it may sound to anyone, really.<br/><br/>This is a movie where every scene is perfect, every dialogue is error-free, the camera is masterful, and the ending is touching, nothing can be taken away from it or anything to add. I don't like to say it often so it doesn't lose value, but I just have to: The movie is perfect!"

The psychologist is trying to help the boy but to no avail. After the boy is able to help the ghosts he sees pass on it is revealed that the psychologist is also dead. The boy then helps that ghost move on as well. Nowadays when people talk about M. Night Shyamalan there is an air of disappointment that always seems to be present. His recent movies have not been received well, for good reason. But why aren't they good? The one consistency that appears throughout his movies is his style of storytelling. ""The Sixth Sense"" benefited greatly from his model, as it was his debut into the film industry and it might'v felt fresh as M. Night was rather unknown. Pinning ""The Sixth Sense"" as anything other than M. Night's first in a series of mediocre movies would be (in my opinion) dishonest. The only redeeming quality about this film is Haley Joel Osment's performance, and I would not accredit that to M. Night's directing skills considering his later works (""The Happening"", ""The Last Airbender""). Everything else about the movie is told in the M. Night style I have grown to resent.

Perfectly benign fare to pass a dull afternoon, and I think devotees of Willis will get their fill. There's less plausibility in the other characters and the screenplay seems to reflect this in the way the pair seem estranged from the rest of the world somehow. As I said, there's little real scares here and I'd call it a kind of drama fantasy than a biting thriller.

Secondly, the scene which the couple is threaded by murder cut in sometimes, but you can't know the outcome. But you can solve the mysteries at last scene.

He sees a second chance for himself in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), and is determined not to fail this time. Malcolm has self admittedly been detached from his home life and believes that he won't be back to normal until he helps Cole. <br/><br/>Cole is a young boy who is the odd one out at school. He fears events that happen around him that no one else can see, and he is afraid to tell anyone his secret. Cole doesn't have any friends and his mother (Toni Collette) is not always able to see everything going on with him due to the responsibilities she takes on as a single mother. <br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan creates a wonderful film that follows the relationship between a troubled young boy and the doctor trying to help him.

The same night Malcom received his award, an ex-patient Vincent who claimed that Malcom Crowe did not help him entered Malcom Crowe's home and then shot him. Because of this incident Malcom Crowe took it upon himself to help Cole Sear who happened to have similar problems as Vincent. Cole believed that Malcom was the only one who could help him.<br/><br/>The theme of the film ""Sixth Sense"" is that people have the will to correct their mistakes even after their death. In the film, Malcom was shot dead by Vincent mainly because he could not help Vincent to solve his psychological problems and this made Malcom Crowe to make a committed decision to help Cole a nine year old boy whose psychological problem was increasing. Malcom felt like a second chance was given to him to finish his uncompleted work and so when he got that chance he stayed focused to help Cole Sears. As human beings we often do mistakes that contribute to our downfall but in our struggle we fight our way back to try to correct those mistakes. When people have the opportunity to correct mistakes, they do all what they can to make sure that they get it right. As it was demonstrated by Malcom Crowe, he was able to help Cole to come out of his psychological problem.<br/><br/>The lighting in the film Sixth sense is mostly Low-Key lighting and somewhat dark. The lighting does not look bright and that indicates sadness or that something terrible is about to happen. Taking a close look at the opening scene, at the basement where Anna Crowe the wife of Malcom Crowe was picking up a wine from the shelf, it was dark and that presuppose that something terrible was about to happen. Lo and behold, Malcom Crowe was shot by Vincent shortly after they entered their bedroom.<br/><br/>Sixth Sense film's camera movement was very extraordinary in the sense that shot were taking close to the characters. These shots illustrates the characters emotions. The shot taking at the scene where Cole Sears was talking to Malcom Crowe while he was in bed, shows that he was crying and timid and that is the best form of him expressing his emotions.<br/><br/>Sixth Sense is an incredible film. It touches the bases of the effect of broken home, Doctors commitment to help kids with psychological problems and the treatment giving to kids with psychological problems at school. I think broken home parents should be committed to do their best to help kids with psychological problems and also schools should make sure that kids with psychological issues are protected by so doing past mistakes will be corrected."

","Initially, right now I'm really interested in humanity-subject. Not the kind of human race, but the human-feeling inside. I mean our conscience, or our human instinct. Yes, human as true human, not just a slave, weirdo, crazy-man, or etc. And The Sixth Sense (1999), just give another kind of human, a gifted boy as human. Yes, for such a talented boy, not everybody will accept him. The protagonist, Cole Sear, is just another ordinary child who also need to be loved, listened, and appreciated, in spite of his sixth sense. Before this, I just want to make a clear side about how I see the ghost itself. So, honestly I still believe in ghost, in other dimension of our world. The ""cinema reason"" is so that I can enjoy the horror-movie and movie like this. Yes, maybe just in the movie I believe in ghost. But, usually ghost-movie is identical with horror, and The Sixth Sense make the very opposite perspective. A ghost-cinema with humanity approach. There are two main idea of this review, humanity in people who sees ghost and in spirit itself.<br/><br/>The basic idea is human knows to be human. So for this case, Cole really knows how other people really think of him. And how he should do to be normal-child. But, he just can't hold this ability. He sees dead-people everyday, he is afraid as a normal human. The problem is, nobody cares of him, what a pity. He just need someone who doesn't think he's nuts. Until he met a child psychologist, who on the first time doesn't believe in him. This is one of the essential human needs, the needs to be appreciated and accepted. Human can't live without this. And this movie delivers tiny message of it.<br/><br/>The other humanity is in ghost itself. In movie, I believe in ghost like I said. So, from this movie, we learn that they are also need to be listened. However, not all people see them. And someone who can see them, such as Cole, afraid of their scary physical body. Let's say, if you look people with leprosy or other horrible disease, you will afraid of them, especially help them. This is what I get, everybody even ghost need to be listened. In real life, you can learn from people with acute health or physical problem. Of course, it takes time and great bunch of tolerance, but at the end we can see the joy of caring other people.<br/><br/>From the core of movie, let's review the extrinsic part. So twisted and simple. The story is just nothing but superb. That's why I rated it 8 out of 10. Why not 9, because the cinematography is also simple, the setting is monotonous. But, what's good in movie, is just the original yet unique idea. This movie just make another breakthrough of how should we see ghost added by wonderful story and natural acting.

A lesser horror movie director uses loud noises and screaming performances; Shyamalan doesn't need to. His story, characters and grasp of film grammar are so strong that pulling the focus down into long, loosely composed shots results in a much richer picture. Scenes like the one where Cole's mother loses her temper with him over the pendant are typical of this - one simple shot of a little kitchen, where what's going on emotionally carries a tremendous dramatic wallop. If only all directors as young as this guy understood how to do this. Similarly, the casting of Willis is a real masterstroke - an action actor known for barnstorming pyrotechnics reigned in here to a slight, slow, careful performance which is arguably the best in his career. Equally good is the amazingly mature Osmont (who was eleven), at once convincing us of his fantastic predicament but also grasping the tone of the story perfectly. The other crucial element here is James Newton Howard's tingling score, which slides around the wintry Philadephia streets, creeps up behind us when we're not looking and creates an almost tangible sense of fear and danger. Horror movie music is the hardest to write and the most effective when done well, and this is a classic case of how to do it right; Shyamalan has wisely secured Howard's services on all his subsequent films. This was a deservedly big hit on release, probably because it effectively combines horror, thriller and drama elements, and appeals to fans of all. In essence however it's just a great story, four fascinating characters, great photography (by Tak Fujimoto), scary music, and enchanting viewing. Trivia - the director appears in his customary small role as the doctor who talks to Cole's mother at the hospital."

","I just saw this movie a few day's ago. It is definitely worth watching. It had a good cast. The three leads performed their characters quite well. (Toni Collete, Bruce Willis, and especially Haley Joel Osment). This movie actually wasn't all too scary. It was very suspenseful while I was watching it (which was late at night). The strange thing is I experienced more anticipation in this movie than any ever. As far as horror goes anyway. It really had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes, with my heart thumping. Then again, movies are a lot scarier in a quiet setting with the lights off. It also made the hairs on my arm stand up. (you can hear an explanation of why this happens in the movie). I appreciate scary movies like this a lot more than the graphic ones. They have more depth and are not built just around shocking scenes. I enjoyed The Ring, and 1408."
"Flyer78","10","1","2","16 June 2009"," The best ""thinking"" movie all time.
","I will not be reviewing The Sixth Sense. I will be reviewing M. Night Shyamalan's flawless masterpiece.<br/><br/>First off, the acting in this movie is beyond excellent. Haley Joel Osment delivers a great performance as the character Cole, and Bruce Willis as Dr. Crowe delivers an equally good role, if not a better one. But who plays the better role is out of the question when you are talking about a movie of such quality as this. Shyamalan did such a great job with the writing of this movie and like my summary suggests, this movie really makes you think. And by the end, all of the loose ends or missing puzzle pieces come together and everything makes sense. You can watch this movie several times over and you will always pick up something you missed the last time. I have seen a few movies that had a big twist ending, and this has gotta be the 2nd best twist ending of all time- Only behind Stephen King's ""The Mist."" But when you look at the entire picture, Sixth Sense is the superior film, The Mist only had the superior ending.<br/><br/>I suggest you drink some caffeine before watching this, because you need to watch it at night with the lights out, but you can't be sleepy, because you're going to need your thinking cap for this. But as long as you give it your attention (while still having a good time watching) you will thoroughly enjoy this film."

"MaxBorg89","9","1","2","16 June 2008"," A clever, gore-free horror thriller
","Though many believe it to be true, The Sixth Sense is not M. Night Shyamalan's directorial debut (in fact, it's his third movie), but that myth holds up well because no one knew about him before this film. Not his proper first, then, but the first significant one, and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Influenced by TV shows like Tales of the Unexpected and The Twilight Zone, Shyamalan crafts a slow-burning, low-key thriller that grabs the viewer right from the beginning: psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is enjoying an evening at home with his wife when he's suddenly attacked by a former patient (Donnie Wahlberg). Months after this shocking prologue, Malcolm's marriage is in jeopardy and he needs some kind of redemption for what he believes to be a professional failure. He finds that redemption in the shape of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy with a terrifying psychic gift, best described by the kid himself: ""I see dead people!"".<br/><br/>That line has been aped countless times since the movie's release, as has the now legendary twist ending, which has become a Shyamalan trademark. But knowing about the twist, or guessing what it is at an early stage of the viewing, is beside the point: it isn't the ending itself that matters, but the build-up. Consider other famous ""twist"" movies, like The Crying Game, Psycho, The Usual Suspects or Fight Club: the revelations at the end or halfway through those features are brilliant, no doubt, but if the overall film is bad it will diminish the epilogue's impact, no matter how smart the latter is.<br/><br/>As such, when watching The Sixth Sense, the attention shouldn't go to the climax, but to everything that precedes it: how Shyamalan creates tension with very few camera movements, most of the creeps coming from James Newton Howard's score; how the story evolves slowly and naturally, enabling us to care for the characters and their inner struggles; how the subdued Willis and the creepy Osment constitute one of cinema's best on-screen duos, with able support from Wahlberg, Toni Collette and others (Mischa Barton's cameo is one of the scariest things of the '90s).<br/><br/>The trick is in the smaller details, and that's what makes The Sixth Sense an immensely satisfying experience. Instead of gore and monsters, Shyamalan uses psychology and subtle chills to construct a memorably unsettling atmosphere, adding emotion on top. And, of course, the unsurpassed ending."

It was great because you don't know whats going to hit you, and thats how a real movie should be. It was the best movie i have seen in years.

"Funbeck-95","9","1","2","12 April 2008"," a truly amazing film
","The Sixth Sense is an absolute gem, it is one of those challenging films that will stick in your mind and have you thinking about it for weeks after watching it. The plot is downright genius, it's so cleverly and precisely orchestrated that the resulting twist will just leave your jaw rightfully on the floor! The twist is so shocking, I will avoid the overwhelming temptation to give it away, watching it in ignorance will ultimately have the best effect.The cast is superb, Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis gives a refreshing change of pace performance as award winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Joining him is the critically acclaimed child actor Haley Joel Osment, last seen in Artificial Intelligence. The acting talents of this young boy are phenomenal, I have never seen such powerful presence, he is mature beyond his years.Haley thoroughly deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar nomination for his role as 'Cole'; a gifted young boy with the exceptional ability of having the sixth sense. Possessing this gift however only serves to create fear in the mind of a nine year old, and scepticism in everyone around him. Cole experiences terrifying, unwanted visits from the spiritual world, which inevitably leads to his social isolation. Dr. Crowe recognises Coles behaviour, and remembers many years back when he had a patient with the same symptoms. This patient however left a painful impact on his conscience, as he was unable to help. Dr. Crowe then seeks to redeem himself by doing everything in his power to help troubled Cole.As Cole is alone in seeing and hearing these suffering spirits, it is also he who must help them rest. To do this Cole must confront his nightmare. It is only with Dr. Crowe's suggestion to listen to them, he makes the discovery that they are not there to haunt him, but instead only want his assistance in their unfinished business.With the riveting intensity you'll find thoroughly chilling and utterly forgettable, The Sixth Sense is a must see movie.The 2 disc collectors edition has wonderful special features, including exclusive interviews with the cast and writer/director."

","A creepy little spook movie to watch on a Saturday night. The Sixth Sense will remain a classic for a very long time if not forever. 10 star performances and a little twist at the end makes a good movie.<br/><br/>I don't like movies that keep me up at night. This didn't but it had me turning around a lot hoping for a spirit not to be standing behind me. This is one of those movies that will scare the hell out of some and will not even make some jump. It depends on what sort of person you are. If pale ghosts with slit wrists walking past doors scare you then you may not want to see this movie.<br/><br/>The twist was good. I didn't see that coming. But some will see it coming a mile away. It was ruined for some by 50 first dates.<br/><br/>WARNING: DO NOT WATCH 50 FIRST DATES BEFORE WATCHING THIS. IT GIVES THE ENDING AWAY.<br/><br/>Check out my 50 First Dates comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/usercomments-enter<br/><br/>Luckily i had seen The Sixth Sense before i saw 50 first dates.<br/><br/>Now the acting. It is extremely rare to find a great performance from a kid. But Haley Joel Osment gave me the greatest performance i have ever seen from a child. He is disturbing and a cursed kid. Bruce Willis plays a very different role then the hero John McClane. But he was still good. But the one who stole the show was Toni Collette. She was just so natural and great. She played Haley Joel's mum. She was just excellent.<br/><br/>You might be thinking why has she said it is so good and then gave it an 8/10. Well i am not a fan of this movies at all. But on its own it is a great movie. Make your own decision. I recommend it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"eldavidotaco","9","1","2","12 November 2006"," one of the best horror movies ever!
","this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and it really proves what an excellent film maker M. Night Schymalan is. I don't think the pace of the movie is too slow, it's necessary to build up the right tension. I saw the movie three times in the theathres in 1999 and I was just as scared every single time. Just like in all movies by this director the ending is very surprising. Still, I don't think that Schymalan has ever made a movie this good again. Unbreakable was a decent movie, so was Signs and The Village but they're not even close to The Sixth Sense. Haley Joel Osment is with out a doubt the best child actor ever and it's too bad you don't see him in so many movies today, except for that time in the news when he was caught drunk driving. In my opinion this is a movie that everybody should see."

","One of the most frightening scenes in this film which people rarely seem to mention is at the beginning when that guy with no clothes on jumps into the house of our child psychologist, the speech he makes before he hits the trigger sent a shiver up my spine immediately. Its a cold scene that shatters the warm atmosphere they are in before he appears. Our child Psychologist becomes obsessed with helping one of his patients, a terrified young boy who sees dead people, the two leads are magnificent, a good script even if you guess the downbeat ending, at the time I did not because these kind of twists were still just about becoming in vogue. Actually when I saw this film I loved it because it had a new recipe to horror movies, it struck new chords inside which is not always easy. The parts I found very creepy is that our camera inside the house plays the eyes of the dead, which I found very threatening."

","My congratulations to a fine direction by M. Night Shyamalan. His film, The Sixth Sense is a spectacular movie, with special effects and especially the way it plays out. Shyamalan does such a great job concealing the secrets until the end. But those secrets are only good when it is the first time you are watching the movie. The second time around, you know what is going to happen, and the suspense suffers quite a lot from this layout.<br/><br/>The storyline was wonderful, and this is something that could happen to people. The Sixth Sense is a spine tingling good time, that anyone will enjoy, at least the first time viewing it anyway. Bruce Willis did such a great job acting as Malcom in the film, you wouldn't suspect anything to be up. It just looks as though he an his wife are not speaking. To know the real truth behind ""The Sixth Sense"", you have to see this thriller for yourself."
"pro_crustes","7","1","2","9 July 2006"," Come on, was anyone really surprised?
","Imagine what seeing this film would have been like if you had known the ending in advance. All those oh-so-clever scenes where Willis's character alternates dialog with the character of his wife... they'd be about as gripping as a magic trick when you already know that it's done with mirrors.<br/><br/>Well, that's how it was for me. At the moment he meets the boy in the church, I turned to my wife and said, ""He's ____."" Honestly, I had not seen any of the promos, nor heard any of the hype, for this film. My wife picked it. So, when I got the ""punch line"" early, the next hour or so became a dreary, repetitious slog, with me dumbfounded by the inability of the rest of the audience (I spent about as much time watching them as watching the screen) to see what, I thought, was so blazingly obvious.<br/><br/>Great idea(s) in this film, but hanging so much of it on one ""surprise"" at the end was a dumb move, in my humble opinion. For those of us who saw it coming (and, really, I'm not the most perceptive fellow around; can so many folks have actually been fooled?), the surprise was that we were still awake to hear our neighbors gasp."

Bruce has thrown his blood stained vest in the garbage to do this role, he is utterly believable. I never once thought about his famous catchphrase from his Die Hard film, Yipee Kie hey Mother ******! Hayley Joel Osment is such a great actor beyond his years, it is the first film I have seen where a child actor totally captures such an emotional role. His eyes, face say more than his words, Hayley is a fantastic actor and I hope to see him in more films soon. Toni Collete I think is brilliant in the role of Coles mother she is captivating and has such a fantastic screen appeal. The story has a twist at the end which I think is clever.

","The Sixth Sense is one of the celebrated movies of all time more because of its mind-blowing climax. To me however, the movie stands for much more than just its ending. In particular, the two relationships in the movie, that between Cole and his mother, Lynn, and between Malcolm and Anna were handled with great delicacy.<br/><br/>Toni Collette has delivered a flawless performance as Cole's exasperated mom who tries in vain to understand her son's psychological nightmares. The scenes between mother and son are few in number but have been constructed with great care and meticulousness and go a long way in describing their relationship.<br/><br/>In the case of Malcolm and Anna, the former's confessions to Cole about his marital problems and Anna's vacant stares into space also describe their strained marriage effectively.<br/><br/>The scenes where Cole confesses his biggest secret to his mother and Malcolm talks to Anna in her sleep are, in my opinion, Shyamalan at his very best. With minimal but very effective dialogues, he shows why he is the master of underplay and subtlety.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense truly is M. Shyamalan Night's masterpiece."

What happened really shocked me. It was not about her but rather about me. I discovered a sluggish scenario, an intolerable cool looking Willis, an unrealistic performance by a 10 year old child, gaps, Jumps and oversimplifications in the story and so on. Approaching the end my wife told me, what kind of crap you made me see and lost my evening, he is also dead isn't he? I surprisingly responded, how did get it? well!! piece of cake, she replied, even a child can foresee it. That was the end of all. She has a good judgment of movies so her phrase shock me. The magic was all lost. Conclusion. This is the first time it happened to me. Usually when I see a film again it is because I am sure 100% that it worth it. I am a voracious film eater and I cant be wrong. Final comments. A childish scenario, a commercially promoted film that otherwise could be a masterpiece in another director's hands.

Good plot-no. The acting was acceptable. The sets were good. The suspense, not bad. But a screenwriter has to do better than just ""trick"" you. If there's going to be a twist, or lots of twists, fine. But make sure that they make sense. So many movie makers believe that if they can merely put together a piece with lots of twists and turns so the viewer can be fouled, they have succeeded. But it takes more than that. A lot more.

He's performance is very solid that you actually believe him. His contribution to the genre won't be forgotten, believe me. Hailey Joel Osment steals the show and gives probably the second best performance by a child actor in a horror movie (Linda Blair is still the best). The boy can make the audience feel his fears. Toni Collete also gives a touching performance. Solid performances this time.<br/><br/>DIRECTION. M. Night Shyamalan's direction is stylish, classy, and creepy. The man knew how to create a scary atmosphere with dark settings and situations when not expected. Creative shots and camera angles support the good direction. The correct use of lightning and darkness is wonderful. This is a ""ghostly"" direction. Great job.<br/><br/>F/X, SCORE, CINEMATOGRAPHY. -The f/x are pretty good. The dead people look scary. Shyamalan perfectly knew how a big part of the audience visualizes dead people. -Great score. -The cinematography is very Hollywood. It's perfect but very stylish for a horror movie. The ""Hollywood"" look doesn't helps the ""Sixth Sense"" in being 100% scary. Still it's pretty good.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* ""The Sixth Sense"" has made great contributions to the genre. Positive and negative contributions. First, it brought back the ""ghost"" sub-genre and in the best way possible. The story is solid and very well crafted. The events are connected perfectly and that's the main reason that the ending is ""that"" shocking. <br/><br/>Many people say that this movie isn't scary, that the audience can guess the ending at the first half of the movie, that the plot twists do not impress, blah, blah. You know there's a lot of people like that...I bet that 99% of these people, if they watched the movie OBJECTIVELY; were actually shocked by the movie's ending and goings. The so called experts in the genre (most of them are obsessed with the 70's horror movies) can't accept the movie's originality and success. I'm not a big fan of these kind of movies but I accept it's an original horror movie with a great ending. The bad thing about the movie is that it served as model for many horror movies that try to create a shocking ending but fail miserably and disturb the audience. The ending in this movie is carefully planned, it connects all the situations perfectly with the scare factor. Unlike other movies that abruptly come up with a ""shocking"" ending that angers the audience (a la ""The Village"").<br/><br/>The truth is that the movie is very original and offers something that no other horror movie had before (or at least it wasn't very popular and in the reach of the fans of the genre). The movie is not only about horror or scares; there's drama (a mother worried about her son), a message of respect to the phenomenons that science can't explain, and a message of life (the whole Bruce Willis situation with his wife). The movie is by no means scarier than the brilliant ""Exorcist"" but it's a movie that commands the new generation of horror movies. It's the reference to the late 90's horror and that's something that will forever mark the genre. It was about time for evolution.<br/><br/>8.5/10 One of the best horror movies that catches the attention of the viewer since minute 1. Not many big budget horror movies can accomplish something like that. And it's harder to find them in this new century that seems to be making a a lot of damage to the genre."

","M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" is a very haunting tale about a boy who can see and talk to people that don't know they're dead. Some scenes in this movie are disturbing, and some are upsetting. But if you listen closely to everything the actors say, even if it's hard to hear and hard to remember, it all makes sense in the end. Much like ""Holes"" and ""Signs"", another fantastic movie directed by Shyamalan. The ending of this movie is a humongous surprise, which makes you feel different about the whole movie. Just like ""Signs"", this movie made me bawl my eyes out. 10/10* An excellent motion picture. It wasn't much of a horror movie, but it was very creepy indeed."
"ObsessiveViewer","7","1","2","21 July 2004"," Will Go Down In Cinema History As A Brilliant Hitchcockian Classic
","*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind Buy<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense was M. Night Shyamalan's first masterpiece. For the two people who have yet to see this film I will clue you in on what it is about. The Sixth Sense is a supernatural thriller about a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) who discovers that he made a mistake with a former patient named Vincent. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled young boy with remarkable similarities to Vincent. Malcome makes it a personal mission to help Cole so that he can feel better about his former patient. By the way, Cole's problem is that he can see dead people.<br/><br/>
There are very few ways that this film could have been better. However, one way to make it better has nothing to do with the film itself. If the promos for the film hadn't shown Haley Joel Osment saying the famous phrase, ""I see dead people"" over and over again than the film would have been much more surprising. Image the surprise in learning that the reason that Cole is so messed up is because he is haunted by ghosts. Not that it needed to be anymore surprising. The big twist at the end has been regarded as both brilliant and ridiculous for the past five years. I am one of the many who believe it to be brilliant. After seeing it for the first time you will be blown away. The ending is not the only reason to see the film.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis strayed away from his traditional action hero roles when he starred in this film. It was all around a different character for him and he nailed it. Willis makes Malcome Crowe come alive and conveys his emotions easily in the film. Haley Joel Osment was great as Cole Sear. I am not quite sure if he was good enough to merit a nomination for best supporting actor though. His constant whispering got slightly annoying but was necessary considering the plot.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's screenwriting and direction in The Sixth Sense is nothing short of incredible. The pacing was slow and it added to the tension Night so brilliantly created. A lot of people find Night's style boring and difficult to watch (especially in his later films). I love the slow development of the story and characters and increased ""creepiness."" James Newton Howard was the film's composer. His music fits the film perfectly and makes it even more suspenseful. M. Night Shyamalan gave himself a name with The Sixth Sense and raised the bar for all future supernatural thrillers. The Sixth Sense is a ***** film and, I say this a lot, but if I believed in organizing a list of my favorite films than needless to say this would be pretty high up."
"igiskos2","3","1","2","28 June 2004"," First of a kind
","This was the first Shymalan's flick and i have to say that he made a good work creating a dark environment which is essential for a thriller. I guess the end was also a bit unexpected which gave some points on the project. Thats all with the positive side of the film. I'm afraid that the negative overcomes the positive easily. When i first saw this film i thought it was OK. I gave the creator the benefit of the doupth since it was his first movie and all.<br/><br/>This changed rapidly after watching his second movie.You see i didn't like the first one, i didn't liked it at all, but i convinced myself i didn't hate it cause i thought the director, as a first timer, having a low budget to work with he presented at least a honest effort to the public. Later on, after i watched Unbreakable and realized that this was the way that M.N.Shyamalan really wanted to direct i let myself free and expressed my true opinion. <br/><br/>This movie sucked as his second one. The budget of the flick wasn't small(we are talking about 60.000.000 dollars) and the absence of the visual F\X wasn't something of a trick to cover the absence of money in production. The Matrix was shoot with the same amount of money and you can see where the money went. Here nothing really happens. The action is slow, the acting is just tolerable and the script was a bit boring except the very original ending. This is one of the few ghost stories that i've seen with absolutely no visual effects(the others were mostly b-movies and low budget cults which by the way i enjoyed more). I don't want to get into details but i've also noticed some mistakes-gups in the script which, i'm sure, most of the people that have seen this film also noticed. The only thing that's annoying for me is the money that this film gathered at the box office, which were a lot. Watching all of Syamalans films makes me believe that he tricks people to watching them. He selects catchy topics for his movies and then he plays a game. The game is shooting the movies using minimum f\x trying to gather maximum people at the cinemas. I can say that he does this with success but i think that he is already a castaway in the minds of the true Sci-Fi of Horror fans. Don't take me wrong, i'm not into senseless use of CGI effects which can turn a movie in a video game(see Van Helsing) but when the topic is from the world of fantasy the director should add effects and substance creating a unique result.<br/><br/>Anyway i believe that people who haven't already seen the ""Sixth Sense"" should probably do it but i ""sense"" that this will be a one way ride and probably will never watch it again......I sure didn't."
"goodm0urning","2","1","2","13 May 2004"," Poorly-made fluff
","Since I'm sure anyone who hasn't seen the film yet (and hasn't had it spoiled for them) has already been subjected to numerous accolades for Director M. Night Shyamalan, I'll get right to the point of my review: no, Sixth Sense is not a good movie.  It is a mass of poorly-joined, generally pointless fluff, punctuated by a hilariously-contrived and completely predictable ""twist.""  This is unfortunate, because due to the weakness of the material surrounding it, the entire production sinks or swims on the strength of that one plot twist.<br/><br/>Ergo, A. If you figure it out before it happens, B. If somebody spoils it for you, or C. You're not surprised by anything in movies, then the film is absolutely worthless.<br/><br/>Shyamalan does get bonus points for creating a creepy-as-hell atmosphere--but creepy atmosphere doesn't make a good movie.  The Sixth Sense lacks quality character development, decent performances (Bruce Willis is flat, as is Haley Joel Osment), and a plot that is involving, or at least coherent.  In place of these key factors is merely a series of unrelated events, each of which inevitably--and predictably--ends in a telegraphed ""boo!"" moment, complete with an atonal stab of music and a jumpy edit.  Fine for the Scream crowd, but I look for a little more intelligence in my horror movies."
"tfrizzell","Null","1","2","30 April 2004"," I Just Have a Feeling About Films Like This.
","""The Sixth Sense"" is one of those rare films that really gets under your skin and stays there. Young Haley Joel Osment (in an Oscar-nominated role) is slowly going crazy due to the fact that he is seeing dead people who literally walk around as ghostly spirits. Enter child psychiatrist Bruce Willis who is having marital problems and blames himself for the demise of one of his former patients. Together they go on a harrowing journey of unexplainable phenomena which culminates in one of the greatest surprise endings in the history of the cinema. Indian director M. Night Shyamalan (Oscar-nominated in writing and directing) shows Spielberg-like potential with only his third production. Toni Collete (also Oscar-nominated) is adequate as Osment's answer-seeking mother. However, it is Osment who keeps the audience on its toes and Willis' equally riveting turn that are at the heart of ""The Sixth Sense"". 1999 was a year of disappointments in the movie world, but this picture was one of the few that really delivered on its pre-release hype. 4 stars out of 5."

","I have enjoyed Shyamalan's other efforts, but this movie was horrible. Cow dung.  One of the biggest wastes of time I ever experienced, and that includes my environmental science class from high school.<br/><br/>This movie was not only stupid and a waste of Bruce Willis' talent, but it was also insulting to the viewers intelligence.  There are holes in the plot large enough to move troops through which are covered up by silly lines and ghosts.  This movie is an over produced monstrosity which should be avoided at all costs. If this movie is hailed as a classic after I'm gone from this world, I'll be rolling in my grave."

"MF210","9","1","2","29 September 2003"," Very Good Thriller
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense was undeniably one of the best films of 1999. Director-Writer M. Night Shyamalan claims he is a fan of Hitchcock and it definitely shows. I am not saying The Sixth Sense is a rip off of a Hitchcock film but its definitely Hitchcock-like. If Hitchcock saw this movie I am sure he would be very impressed. <br/><br/>The genius of The Sixth Sense is definitely in its script. The dialogue is well-written, but most importantly its very well structured. The Structure is relatively simple but it hides the twist at the end while revealing some clues along the way. None of the clues gave away the ending for me. The twist is simple yet very effective. I was blown away at the end of the film. Shyamalan has written a very, very good screenplay. <br/><br/>The Script is probably the main strength of the film, but the acting is also quite good. Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in a restrained performance as a psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment is excellent as the disturbed boy, Cole. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mother. Shyamalan is fine in a small cameo. <br/><br/>The movie is also atmospheric and chilling. So many memorable scenes, but one scene looked very awkward to me. Its a scene between Bruce Willis Character (Malcolm Crowe) and Cole that seemed a bit too sentimental to me. Other than that, Sixth Sense is a very good thriller."

"mattymatt4ever","7","1","2","5 September 2002"," Intriguing and original
","I am not the biggest fan of ""The Sixth Sense"" and don't believe it deserved quite as much word of mouth as it received, but I can't completely discredit the film.  It is well-done and quite intriguing.  I recently bought the DVD, since it was used and I purchased it for a cheap price.  Plus, I was curious about how it would feel watching it for a second time.  I watched it in theaters and thought it was pretty good, but like many others I wanted to see it again to try to uncover clues I didn't perceive the first time around and discover certain elements that I may have overlooked.  I still don't think it's a great movie, but it was interesting watching it and keeping in mind the big plot twist at the end.  As I watched it, the twist made a lot of sense and M. Night Shamalyan didn't just sneak it in for shock value.  He obviously put a lot of thought into both creating this big surprise and making it credible.  When I accessed the ""Rules and Clues"" feature on the DVD, that confirmed my theories and exposed a few details that I didn't even notice on the second viewing.<br/><br/> The acting is good all-around.  Bruce Willis gives, probably, his most low-key performance up-to-date.  He is both compelling and convincing, not getting in the audience's face with a showy dramatic performance.  Haley Joel Osment was the perfect choice for Cole, and I don't think the phrase, ""I see dead people,"" would be the same coming out of any other child actor's mouth.  A good child actor is hard to find, and Haley Joel is one of the few who I can actually say measures up to a good deal of adult actors.  He's not ""good for a little kid""; he's just a good actor period.  His Oscar nomination was well-deserved.  His acting is very subtle, not broad in any way.  Toni Collette also deserved her Oscar nomination.  I don't live in Philadelphia, so I can't technically judge whether or not her accent was ""on target,"" but I know for sure that she pulled off a flawless American accent. And she went the extra mile by taking on a dialect.  Just like Osment, her acting is very subtle and you sense the pain and anguish she feels as a single mother of this estranged kid without her having to continuously sob and burst into tears.  Actors should know that you don't need to cry to express sadness.  9 times out of 10, people try their best to hold back the tears--at least when they're in public or in front of other people.  Donnie Wahlberg makes a short but memorable appearance as one of Willis's former patients, and actually plays an important role in the story as you will learn.<br/><br/> What I didn't like about ""The Sixth Sense""?  Altogether, it's slow-moving and surely could've used some editing.  And some of the dialogue is corny and stilted.  I wouldn't classify this as a ""scary movie.""  Some have deemed this as one of the scariest movies of all time.  To that I say ""Hell no.""  I think of it more as a sci-fi/mystery.  It's not always entertaining, but it's intriguing and gives your brain a lot of work.<br/><br/> If you decide to rent or purchase the DVD, another fun feature to check out is Shamalyan's (very very) first movie--as in he was 12 years old and shot it with his own video camera.  They only show a clip from the movie and, as he said, it's awful--but it's always fun to watch famous or up-and-coming directors' work back when they were starting amateurs.  Like he says, if you watch this crappy movie, you will understand why Shamalyan doesn't do special f/x.  I gotta admire the guy.  If I were releasing one of my films on DVD (in the far future) I wouldn't show my first movie--a crappy ""X Files"" film that I shot back in junior year of high school as a project for my TV Production class.  That really takes guts.<br/><br/> My score:  7 (out of 10)"

","SPOILER ALERT!! With all the hype surrounding this movie, naturally you are going to see it with high expectations. It's one thing to have  an ending which is 'surprise' because it was clever and the audience didn't think of it, but quite another when the 'surprise' is because the ending simply doesn't make any sense. The audience feels cheated in that case. I mean, come on... *SPOILER* - a year living with his wife as a dead person, and he doesn't make the connection until the end of the movie?

"trumpman30","5","1","2","20 May 2002"," A good movie, but overrated.
","*Spoilers* I can start out by saying that I am somewhat biased to this movie because I do not like child actors.  Their characters are just never believable in my opinion.  That aside, this movie was pretty well done and had an alright story to tell, but what was the overall point to it?  What was the lasting emotion or thought on the movie?  The whole movie seems to center around Bruce Willis trying to get inside the kid and get him to accept him. Seriously, this takes up almost three fourths of the movie.  Then, at the end, it seems like the director realized that he did not have very much time left in the movie and kind of threw in that last little bit about the mother poisoning the child and rushed the big climax where Bruce Willis finds out he is dead.  It seems that the entire movie had just been put together for that one twist of an ending.  The ending is very good, but an ending cannot make up for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie does have some genuinely scary and creepy parts but for the most part seems indecisive as to whether its a drama or a horror movie. <br/><br/>
There are some parts where I was left questioning, ""huh?"" after watching it a second time.  I don't remember too well but did they not skip three months between the time Willis was shot and when the actual movie begin?  What was Bruce's character doing all this time and where did he think the time had gone if he truly did not know he was dead. I did not know about red being used as symbolism until they told me about it after the movie and that is probably why they put that segment at the end. No one picked up on it because it had almost nothing to do with the plot of the movie.  It's almost like the director threw that in there so he could say, ""Hey, everyone, I'm smart, I can use subtle symbolism.""  The symbolism itself is so broad that its largely ineffective for when something red appears it just has ""something to do with dead person,"" even if a dead person had just touched it or something.<br/><br/>There are certain saving graces about this movie.  Bruce Willis turned in a good performance and it did makeyou think in some parts, but ultimately a movie that will quickly be forgotten, maybe faster if everyone would stop making parodies of it =).  Overall, not one of my favorite horror/dramas. 5/10"

It doesn't, however, make up for a horrible film.  What was Bruce Willis thinking when he read this script?  I mean, Willis isn't the best actor in Hollywood, but he should have at least had the brains to let someone else suffer through this (well, I mean someone BESIDES the people who saw it ... we suffered the most).<br/><br/>I feel that I need to mention Haley Osment.

I was very careful to avoid reading too much about the plot, because I had heard that there was a ""great"" twist, and I didn't want to ruin the surprise. I've never been so disappointed.<br/><br/>The fatal flaws:<br/><br/>1. The trailer was too explicit: So I think that everybody already knew the Cole's secret (""I see dead people""). Then the scene where the boy tells Willis his ""secret"" (after an hour of boring round and round, without important scenes, with the good doctor trying to find out the ""secret""), is as cold as The Haunting's ""scares"". It's just uneffective and predictable, there's no surprise, actually there's no any feelings or sensations at all.<br/><br/>2. Wwhhyy It's ssssoooo ssllooww ppaacceedd???: I would have appreciated this movie if it had been released last year because I had some problems to sleep. I would have a good time (sleeping) at the movies. There are too many unnecessary scenes and the actors seems to be speaking t-o  a  f-i-v-e  y-e-a-r-'s  o-l-d  c-h-i-l-d. Without the commercials, and X-Files episode goes by 40 minutes length. There's more substance. And ""The Sixth..."" is a 2 hour feature.<br/><br/>
3. The twist: Movies like ""The Crying Game"", ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""Fight Club"", would have been stunning movies even if the screenwriter wouldn't have added their great twists that made them unforgettable films. Why? Well, because the rest of their stories were great. In ""The Sixth Sense"", if you're a middle-skilled watcher, you'll discover the ""famous"" twist after 10 minutes, and it will ruin your experience, because the rest of the movie does nothing else that ""almost scream-it-on-your-face"". The story isn't interesting, because you already know all that could be interesting.<br/><br/>4. The scares / The end: Two scares, one for hour. Happy end. Think in a cross between ""The Shining"" (Great film!) and ""Good Will Hunting"" (not bad). Isn't it like Coke with Corn Flakes?<br/><br/>
The Best scare:<br/><br/>What happened you, Donnie Whalberg!!!!????<br/><br/>I rate this one: 1. (It's a shame we can't vote 0) I feel guilty because Osment does a great effort, but the rest of you, voters, have put this film to close-of-the-top, and I think that It has to be placed in the right place (out of the top 100, at least)."

In this film there is no evident clue to strictly define it as a ""supernatural phenomena"" sort of film, so I kept wondering if there would be a natural explanation that put everything back in our physical universe, transforming it from the ""terror"" to the ""thriller"" category. No such luck. We get the same old story, so many times told.

"Movie-12","9","1","2","22 August 1999"," One of the years best films--with a jaw dropping final twist. ***1/2
","THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) ***1/2<br/><br/>Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Olivia Williams, Toni Collette and Glenn Fitzgerald Written and directed by: M. Night Shyamalan   106 minutes   Rated PG-13 (for much intense material and some related gore)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" is one of the years best films. It brings together effectively and efficiently every concept of why horror films exist. So many movies these days do not live up to the promise of their genre, but ""The Sixth Sense"" does it so perfectly and convincingly  that it is almost hard to tell weather this film is based on actual events or not.<br/><br/>
""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of a psychiatrist named Malcolm Crowe, who, in the film's opening, is confronted by a past client who has broke into his house waving a gun over his head screaming things like ""You lied,"" ""You did not help me"" and especially mysteriously ""Do you know why you are afraid when you're along--I do."" He shoots Malcolm and kills himself.<br/><br/>
The film then cuts to months later, where Malcolm is curious to investigate a nine year old boy, Cole Sear, who has the same rare symptoms as his patient that killed himself recently. He feels it is his duty to cure the child's illness to make up for his slacking off on the other unfortunate patient. <br/><br/>After investigation, and some bonding between the curious Malcolm and the always terrified Cole, he discovers that the boy has a secret. One that is so personal and unbelievable Cole has never explained it to anyone, including his struggling single mother. Soon, however, Cole tells Malcolm his concealed message, ""I see dead people,"" the young boy whispers, ""they walk around like everyone else...they don't even know that they're dead,"" he explains. Naturally at first Malcolm disbelieves him, but as new evidence arrives, and issues involving his wife arise, he must choose between the one he loves or the boy he'll never forget.<br/><br/>The story setup to ""The Sixth Sense"" is thought-out and detailed enough so that we ponder upon it and become involved. It is handled with such delicacy that even the slightest flaw would have destroyed the entire film in which its basis is held together with. Through character issues and the personal territory this film covers, we are weary about entering the character's lives; this is private area hear and it is none of our bussing what is going on inside the head of young Cole Sear. Surly some audiences will feel intimidated about learning his secret since it is so built up with a peek of high tension. The adult terror material is all in line with the film's subject matter; there is no excess violence or gore, nor is there any sub-plots that distract the story from its final message. There is some distraction in the relationship with Malcolm and his wife. But by the end, everything fits together like a perfectly pieced mind puzzle. <br/><br/>
The film is not without flaws, however. Though the subplots do not sidetrack the film, a few of them do not provide enough information to serve a purpose in the plot. For instance, there is a subplot where a dead girl asks Cole to deliver a secret tape involving her death to her father. It has some revealing and emotionally on target material, but we know so little about the characters involving this story that I felt a little lost. And some particular wounds found on the bodies of the individuals inflicted with the ""sixth sense"" seem significant, but are never fully explained. At times in the movie I felt like the characters were dragging on and on, and felt myself shouting inside phrases like  ""come on, get to the point.""<br/><br/>
For the most part, however, the characters pull the plot through tedious moments, like the ones I have listed. The movie has a final twist that excels beyond any other twist revealed in any other thriller I have ever seen. More perplexing than ""Entrapment."" More jaw-dropping than ""Wild Things."" More compelling than ""Goodbye Lover."" And  more awe inspiring than ""Arlington Road."" It is disturbing but somehow completely believable. I am very tempted  to describe the content of the final five minutes to you--but I am afraid that it is up to you to figure out. This twist is so neat that it will make you want to see the movie over again, in order to see if throughout the production the film lived up to the material. This is a very tricky ending to succeed with, but ""The Sixth Sense"" does it wonderfully.<br/><br/>Brought to you by Hollywood Pictures."

","Perhaps careful editing, or a director who's work didn't so resemble a 30 second commercial..there are lots of things that might have made this movie worthy of an exceptional premise, unfortunately - it just ain't here.<br/><br/>I like Bruce Willis - he can play drama, but here, he's given nothing to do but smirk meaningfully while the plot, drags on and on, getting to the point we all know it's going to get to. I actually appreciate movies that cut out all the standard, ""coming to believe a fantastic tale"", bit. You know the routine - character sees strange things..stranger finally tries to make other character believe strange things..plot creaks along until other character finally be;lives strange things exist. That might have played well the first hundred times it was used, but I'd just as soon get to the meat of the matter and move the damn plot along!<br/><br/>Anyway, several scenes are so obviously staged that I found myself watching the extras in the scene, wondering what the assistant directors had told them to do..For instance, take the scene where Willis is late for dinner in the restaurant...The setting and filming looked so obviously staged that I couldn't pay attention to the leads.<br/><br/>Or - a long shot of Willis and the kid walking up the street, just when an entire little-league team walks across the from of the shot..obvious and clumsy, slice of life touches that distract instead of feeling a natural part of the scene.<br/><br/>But - great ending, serviced by the outline of a great plot that was poorly filled in and poorly directed."
"JimB-4","10","1","2","7 July 1999"," Excellent thriller -- intelligent, touching, rewarding
","I saw this at a preview screening, but in June, when the effects and music were in place and the final cut was available. This is the best ghost story I've seen since Robert Wise's classic THE HAUNTING. It's smart and very moving, while still having the requisite thrills. It doesn't cater to the ""jump out and yell Boo! every six minutes"" theory of thriller, but it has a number of genuine shocks (and a fabulous twist toward the end). Bruce Willis is wonderful - subdued and intelligent in his best dramatic performance since IN COUNTRY. And Haley Joel Osment is simply superb as the haunted Cole. He never overreaches or overacts. He simply experiences and reveals. It's one of the best dramatic child performances I've seen in years. If you liked THE INNOCENTS or THE HAUNTING or even GHOST, I highly recommend this film to you."

"Don-102","9","1","2","11 August 1999"," A Back-to-Basics Spook Film That Proves You CAN Scare Without Computers...
","THE SIXTH SENSE is a refreshing and absorbing ghost story that is much more than meets the eye.  It is great to see a major Hollywood release go back to old school fright methods.  Do not expect to see thrill-a-minute, falsely produced chills.  This is a truly original piece of atmospheric filmmaking that earns the viewer's responses, which include frequent oohs and aahs and an occasional scream.<br/><br/>Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan, a Philly native, presents a plodding build-up to one of the best payoffs I have seen in a thriller in the past few years.  Seeing the film, I knew the young boy (played incredibly by Haley Joel Osment) has a ""gift"" and sees certain people walking around no one else can see.  Shyamalan seems to have taken a page out of Spielberg's JAWS, where the shark is never fully seen until crucial climactic scenes, and applied it to the boy's problem.  It is most definitely a problem if you are interacting with people who supposedly no longer walk the earth.  You may be unsure as to what he really is seeing until the great frights and charms of the picture hit you.  You know when Shyamalan means for us to get it and become involved.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is so reserved it is scary in itself and he plays off the boy very effectively.   SIXTH SENSE takes place on some other plane of existence it seems.   That is how I felt.  Sometimes you wonder whether people are seeing the main characters, who are all, in varying ways, mixed up in this whirlwind of terrifying sights and dimensions.  It is not manipulative and the scares do not need manufacturing.  We are led through them as a good script should put an audience through.<br/><br/>Toni Collette has picked up a good South Philadelphia accent and is simply flabbergasted as to what the hell is going on with her seemingly gifted, yet sick, young son.  Osment as ""Cole"", the boy star of the film outshines even Willis and shows he is capable of playing a character deeper than Forrest Gump Jr. (yep, that's him).  There is a lot of religious reference to afterlife which is fitting and the so-called ""twist"" is indeed a twist to remember.<br/><br/>All involved in this surprising production should be proud of the fact that you can still keep an audience in traction with moody story-telling and visuals and NO computer-generated effects.  Compare this to the current release THE HAUNTING and realize how much better these bare bones are.<br/><br/>Rating ***1/2"

","it does not surprise me that most people like this movie so much.  it is often well-acted, has a well concealed plot twist, and many, albeit canned, touching and startling moments.<br/><br/>unfortunately it just isn't very smart.<br/><br/>one can imagine the writer(s) asking this question, ""what if some people with apparent psychological maladies really have insight into another world?""  wouldn't that be nice.  unfortunately this is not the world i am familiar with.  in my world death and grief, the cruelty of human beings and the bonds of love, these things are mysterious.  it is not that my imagination of the variety of 'what ifs' is pedestrian.  it is that i have a wild imagination and am still wracked by uncertainty.<br/><br/>this film glosses over the fundamental human theme of this uncertainty and instead assumes a fantasy world of magic and ghosts and purposefulness to every event.  by showing us the ghosts, not only are we assaulted with cheap special effects, but all uncertainty evaporates...the struggle of the boy and the psychiatrist are a foregone conclusion.  we are left with just the fantasy world.<br/><br/>and it is not a rich fantasy world.  it is mundane.  it is commonplace for us to assume that our lives have meaning and that everything in them is somehow, given just the right perspective, understandable to us.  this film supports that common assumption.  that, i imagine, is why this run of the mill prostitute caked in obvious musical make-up is so attractive to many. it confirms their unquestioned biases."

","I admit that this movie is very dark and creepy, the emotional elements are good and the actors are good, especially the child actor Haley Joey Osment. I just fully believe in his character. He acts naturally, not the ""trying to appear mysterious"" type.  Also, it is the type of movie that make me feel uncomfortable and keep thinking afterwards. However, there are too many plot holes. I just don't understand why some ghosts can move things and some can't, why some ghosts can't see/realize their own wounds... The atmosphere is great though. Also, ghosts that walk pass like normal are much horrible than ghosts which just look scary & dangerous. The story makes me feel depressed too."

Most of the time it was unexciting and bland, and the storyline just seemed to drag on to an implausible ending of confusement. bruce willis was absurd as usual, when is this guy gonna give up trying to act in what could be top-notch thrillers and go back to meaningless action romps? Osmond was okay, you have to give him credit for working with such a 'twilight-zone' script, though I must admit Toni Collete did outshine as the disturbed boys mother.<br/><br/>The simple fact is, for me at least - this movie would have looked better on the small screen as an episode of the X--files or the Twilight-Zone. It just didnt have the strength in characterisation or thrills to make it exciting as a two hour holywood movie. And of course.. like most hollywood entertainment reviewers do..they hyped the movie up and it was applauded by all alike, just beacuse the genre was 'unique' and 'different' from the rest of the crap that hollywood produces.<br/><br/>Though the storyline and genre are certainly unique. And the movie is interesting to watch..it certainly isnt as brilliant as what everyone makes it out to be."

The twist is very obvious & the film does not have anything else to say really in terms of plot. Also what I found annoying was the way the script tried to compensate for the holes in the twist. How could a man not know he is dead? Why can't he see other dead people? Well lets neatly answer that one for you!  <br/><br/>""They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead."" <br/><br/>Despite this it is worth seeing. As already mentioned the cast are all excellent & although this is his first major feature Shyamalan has already established a distinct directorial style. His next film Unbreakable is a far better movie which doesn't just rely on a gimmicky twist ending .Although it does come with a twist in the tail its plot has much more to offer."

A lotta flash and not much substance. <br/><br/>And, I am sorry, but Halley Joel Osment is not the rebirth of Shirley Temple.

While Haley Osment and Bruce Willis are good actors, the dialogue between them is stilted, and the movie drags for a long stretch in the middle.  When the situation between them finally gets resolved, it is handled in too perfunctory a fashion given all the time spent leading up to it.  A lot of time is spent between Willis and Osment accomplishing little, then one incident is shown leading towards the resolution, and then the situation is resolved, and that's it. 4/10."

The phrase of Latin which meant *nothing* to the plot, the ineptitude of a man who, after a year of trying to eat or go to the bathroom without avail, discovers that he is a corpse only through a child, are only two of the many silly elements in the plot. A cute kid actor and a committee-written plot certainly seemed to play well with the public, but when you look beneath the hood, there was very little there.

And he notices that when he sees his wife crying over his wedding ring or whatever (I can't remember exactly). And that's supposed to be very powerful. In fact we're given clues (no one ever really speks to him, but it's not very obvious so you can't guess). Well, that's just PLAIN STUPID !

","The Sixth Sense is a two hour magic trick, of sorts. There are a few good scenes here and there -- viz. the opening, the funeral twist, etc. -- but I have no doubts that Shyamalan came up with the ending before he wrote the movie, and as such the first two hours only exists to avert the audience's attention from the twist ending that is really the point of the whole movie. There are upsides, of course: Osmet's acting was a pleasant surprise, the direction was dark and somber (which -- though it may just be me -- was very appealing), and the score. However, as a whole, it seems like a tedious exercise with a pay-off that doesn't make up for the two hours of dullness that precedes it. That being said, see the movie anyway, because if public opinion means anything (and it does, I reluctantly admit), chances are you'll love this movie."

","""Sixth sense"" is in many ways an extremely beautiful movie and contains some utterly brilliant acting - for example, the initial scene at the Crowes' house made my acting appreciation organ, whichever one that is, turn somersaults. But...<br/><br/>Every fictional story depends to some extent on the suspension of our disbelief in impossible things. A film's ambition at seriousness signals that the suspension required will be relatively small, i.e. that the script attempts to be plausible. ""Sixth sense"" obviously aspires at being a serious psychological drama, so one would expect a rather high level of plausibility.<br/><br/>Whether or not you can accept the basic premise, that souls have individual existence independent of the body (""ghosts"") and that they can influence some living people, depends on your own religious standpoint and fundamental view of the universe, so let us leave that aside. But one unconditional premise in a story that aspires at any kind of plausibility is that all individuals of a certain species are subject to the same basic constraints: e.g. people can't fly, fish can't talk, ghosts can't handle material objects... and if the script writer decides to let an individual go beyond these constraints, the audience is entitled to an explanation.<br/><br/>
WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD!<br/><br/>Now, in Sixth sense we find one ghost who can look perfectly ordinary (and even change clothes) while others only show themselves in the state they were in when they died; the same ghost can enter a church, a place where no other ghosts ever show up; he can throw rocks, play audio recordings and take notes, while it's crucial to the story that a ""regular"" ghost can't by herself move a video tape to where it will be found... All this simply because we aren't supposed to know that he's dead!!! And we get no hint of an explanation why this particular individual is Mr. Superghost!<br/><br/>Another serious hole in the fabric of the story is the gimmick of people ""not knowing that they are dead"". These people walk about and perceive their surroundings, but they don't notice that there's been a funeral, that their bank account is gone, that they can't get service in a store, that they themselves have stopped eating etc. etc. etc.???<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is normally a committed, thorough actor who does his homework and delivers the goods. Even his superheroes and inhabitants of the future are primarily people, who we know can get bored, have a headache or need to go to the bathroom. That's what makes them so easy to identify with and their stories so compelling. - Now, in ""Sixth sense"" individual scenes are beautifully acted, with a gripping psychological reality, but the plot holes indicated above effectively prevent the film from making sense as a whole. Simply speaking, Mr Shyamalan and Mr Willis are too involved in visual and psychological artistry to care whether Crowe goes to the bathroom, and if not, why. And, what's worse, they expect us viewers not to notice. To quote a more traditional Willis hero, ""What do you think I am, stupid?!""<br/><br/>
Obviously, on an artistic level, Shyamalan and Willis work extremely well together. But, for it to become beautiful music, we must hope for a better score."

However, the endless publicity that this film got has given it legendary status. However, I think many people have read a lot more in to this film, than was really there.

"Fiona G.","2","1","2","9 July 2000"," Illogic and constructed
","Whew, with the hype that went around this movie, you got the feeling that you miss out on elemental cinematic history if you don't see it. Unfortunately, that's not true. <br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" tries hard to be a good psycho-thriller and in fact the idea behind it was good. But as the script was written, someone must have had the idea to put the real big bang in there, something no viewer can guess to happen, the totally total of all story twists there ever were. But, bad luck, the grand idea has to fit into the rest of the script, so you have to modify it and make compromises. <br/><br/>And really, I was disappointed with the end. Not because of it, but because everything else was set up for it. I didn't guess the twist because it was so sneaky, but because it was completely implausible. To clarify that I will try hard not to give anything away, in case you didn't see ""Sixth Sense"" yet, so I will ask only one question, which you'll understand later: how do you get into someones apartment without ringing the doorbell or knocking? There are numerous more points like that but by stating them I would give away the surprise. It's too bad the whole film had to suffer just to get that in.<br/><br/>And then there are horror scenes, not too many, but I guess the writers figured that the movie had to give some more than the general idea and the last big bang. And again, they just serve the purpose and are badly integrated: young Cole, they boy who can see ghosts, later finds out that they want him to help them. I think even a ghost can anticipate that scaring someone to death isn't a good start for getting help.<br/><br/>Probably the best asset of the movie is Haley Joel Osment, who played ""Cole."" Marvelous what this young boy could do with his role. Bruce Willis stays a little unbelievable as a psychologist, but that could be the script as well. So far I yet have to encounter a psychologist who handles therapy that way. <br/><br/>Well, nice idea, nice movie, but nothing overly sensational. Horror movies greatly benefit from taking part in our world and incorporating the horror into it. But then they have to stay true to rules we all are familiar with and to those they need to set up to make us bite our nails. If ""Sixth Sense"" would have mastered both, I'd be yelling ""great one!"""

","I'm glad to see that a few users did find this movie completely overrated...<br/><br/>'The Sixth Sense' was uninteresting, and though with reasonable character development, there were some basic flaws that I could not shake while watching this movie (and some later flaws that were pointed out to me that made me realize that this film was the most overrated film of 1999)...<br/><br/>Firstly - about a year had past since the time Willis was killed, and yet, had he never attempted to talk to his wife? What logic was being used when the audience is led to believe that Willis lived with his wife for a year without talking to her? Not only this, but the fact that most likely the first night that Willis, after being killed and him returning to his house, would have realized something was wrong...this fact ruined the movie...<br/><br/>On top of that, other major flaws were made apparent to me (by others) after watching the film - firstly that the dead people were only seen in the areas in which they were killed, raising the question of 'How did Willis manage to walk around town?'...<br/><br/>The second major flaw is that surrounding the fact that the church was a safe-haven for Osment's character - i.e., dead people couldn't enter the church; yet Willis does it on more than one occasion...<br/><br/>I respect Bruce Willis as an actor, but I feel obliged (as I sometimes do) to point out certain aspects of films when they receives unduly recognition - in this case, the film was cast as truly thought-provoking and intelligent...<br/><br/>The ending was indeed different - but that in itself, in my mind at least, was not nearly enough to compensate for the stagnation that was the rest of the film (which was neither thought-provoking as a whole, intelligent, or entertaining)...<br/><br/>I would have given this film [2/10], but since Bruce Willis was in it and did the best he could, I honor his talent...<br/><br/>[3/10]"

I'm not usually surprised at the bad taste of filmgoers, making such colossal hits out of Home Alone and The Lost World, however this film takes the cake.  I enjoyed the performances, particularly Toni Colette, Haley Joel Osment, and the vastly under-appreciated Bruce Willis.  However, as much as I admire some aspects of the film, the denouement is so predictable and frankly, insulting to any thinking adult, that the success of this film astounds me.  If the film had been like ""The Crying Game"" where the ""surprise"" twist is interesting, but more importantly,  a mere plot device to further the film in it's storyline, I might have had less problems with this movie.  I was shocked that anybody would have been fooled for a moment about the health of Bruce Willis' character.  If American audiences are dimwitted and unobservant not to notice the THOUSANDS of obvious hints that preceed the unveiling of the truth, then this is the film for them.  It was insulting to have to sit through the final minutes of the film, being forced to relive earlier scenes that any intelligent moviegoer should already have noticed.  The mere fact that Willis doesn't change his clothes ONCE should have tipped off everybody!<br/><br/>Well, my comments certainly won't stop those people that make hits of such movies as this, but I must raise my voice in protest since the last year has seen such incredible  movies as Three Kings, Magnolia, Election, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Boys Don't Cry, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Topsy-Turvy, Eyes Wide Shut, The Straight Story, Sweet & Lowdown, All About My Mother, and underappreciated gems like The Limey and Go, and a half dozen more that will be remembered much longer than this slim piece of celluloid."

How obvious. people see the ending and the hints (the script was probably written with the ending in mind, so the hints are easy to place) But what they fail to see is that apart from those the script is decidedly average at best, with forced or sometimes outright bad dialogue, and hardly any excitement at all. And then there's directing. This gets a directing nod???? this kitschy oh I dunno. It just makes me mad that this average and kitschy directing gets nominated when Paul Thomas Anderson does not. And finally Toni Colette. She annoyed me the whole film. Every scene with her was like the ultimate proof of what I said before. (though that might have been her dialogues as well, butr even then, just look at Angela Bassett in Strange Days to see just how overblown and absurd dialogue can still be made great - Can you imagine 'I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all' sound believable?

To totally disregard an innovative, thought-provoking film with some semblance of cultural relevance like Fight Club and then nominate this piece in almost every major category is ridiculous. What does the audience get out of this film besides thinking of ghosts the next time they get goose bumps? The hokey plot was lame, the kid was annoying, Bruce Willis was Bruce Willis, and what was with the classroom scene with the microphone visible at the top of the screen?

","People are probably going to write abuse files about my comment, but at least read it first. First off I don't really like M. Night Shyamalan's films. They don't scare me at all, i've seen enough horror movies to know when the ""scary"" moments and clichés are coming, and sometimes the characters can be pretty stupid. I saw the Sixth Sense when i was only SEVEN, which was the time i was scared of a lot of stuff. When i went to bed that night, i didn't lose an inch of sleep. How it can be in the top 250, i don't know. The ""twist"" ending was no surprise, i kinda saw it coming. no person can be able to still walk around living after getting shot a million times by a psychotic person. The little boy was seriously annoying. he was always walking around like a ghost, and while it was ""scary"" for some people, to me it looked like he was drunk. some scenes aren't totally original either. while i was watching, i had this feeling in a few scenes, like ""What movie was that from?"" or ""deja vu"". and a few days later i happened to watch ""Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist"" again and realized what i was talking about. that scene where all the cabinets and drawers are opened is a huge, slap-in-the-face reference to Poltergeist. Also the scenes where the rooms get colder when the dead and unholy are near reminds me of another certain film in the Top 250 that exceeds this film by all standards.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: if you're looking for a decent ghost/supernatural being story, see Poltergeist or The Exorcist. If you like Shymalan's films, i can't say i agree with you, but whatever. that's my opinion. 1/10"

"PlanetBloopy","1","1","4","9 April 2020"," The worst film ever in my opinion
","I suppose we should all have an answer when someone asks what the worst/your most hated film is. The Sixth Sense is that film for me. Perhaps it's relevant that I felt more immature than most of my friends who were hooked by it at the time. I actually avoided all spoilers and saw it a year or so later on free-to-air TV when I was about 16. It was marketed as a thriller/horror, but it came across as a boring, depressing drama full of crying to the point that I didn't give it my full attention. I kept the TV on but I stopped caring long before the ending was revealed.<br/><br/>If I'd first seen it as an adult, I might have a slightly different story, but it's too late. The nature of The Sixth Sense means that it only has one chance to be effective and repeat viewings are laughable. When films grow on you and you enjoy little things you didn't discern the first time around, they're the best. So The Sixth Sense truly is the opposite of the best. It's a film where the more you watch it, the more you notice things wrong with it, until that's practically all you can focus on.<br/><br/>It'd be understandable if only bits such as the restaurant scene came across as unnatural. But to me, the most unnatural element is the way Cole's mother treats him. She's surprisingly curt and unmotherlike considering his young age, which only helps to disrupt any suspension of disbelief I had in what I'm seeing. The couple of gross-out/scare moments thrown in are out of place and an insult to horror fans. Such paltry crumbs make me feel that a movie is just scoring marketing points and the real target audience is my wallet or advertising viewership. It's as if they think a sappy drama with a few horror moments resolves to a gritty thriller on average in the audience's mind. I may be mature now, but I still absolutely loathe sappy dramas and these wrongs do a great job of making the film even that much worse."

","I had a good time watching this film. It had a good plot, and the acting was definitive. This and signs, which will come out two years after this film, are the only two shyamalan films that have impressed me. The plot summed up is that an impeccable child psychologist is gunned down by one of his old patients. A year later, the psychologist appears to have made a full recovery. He meets an emotionally unstable boy, who appears to have a few mental, and social problems. After meeting the boy, he learns that he has a secret dark gift: he is able to see dead people.<br/><br/>The acting was great. For being only 11 years old in this film, Haley Joel Osment did a fantastic job portraying an outcast, who is terrified of his own shadow. Definitely one of the more talented child actors of this era in film. Bruce Willis did a fantastic job of playing a workaholic psychologist, who is in some marital problems. His reaction to the uncovered secret at the end of the film was almost perfect, until after he calmed down. That one scene ruined his performance for almost the entire movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography was up to par, but up to par only. It really wasn't anything game changing, or ground breaking. These are the old cinematic tricks, and I feel that these are the only thing that Shyamalan knows. Close ups, hand helds, and gods eyes over and over again. It was done well with what he had, but it was really bland after a while. Considering most people don't watch a movie for its cinematography, I can't really take off a star for that.<br/><br/>The writing. Okay here we go. Some of you may hate me, some of you may love me. This is 16 years after the film was released. I will say that for the time, this was a good plot twist and almost something new. Just because the famous plot twist at the end was new, doesn't mean it was good. It really was kind of expected and didn't surprise me at all. We see a lot of clichés in this movie. Single mom with two jobs, emotionally unstable social outcast with a secret gift, workaholic with marriage problems, bully who is superior in every way ends up being the outcast in the end, and so on. It's fine that he uses them in his writing, but they just don't impress anyone in the end. Oh here we go again! The elephant in the room. The ending. The plot twist at the end. He was dead all along! Gasp!* but not really. Yes it was clever for him to be dead the whole time, but he made the clues too obvious. He never talks to anyone, his wife never makes eye contact, he almost always wears the same clothes, nobody acknowledges he's even there. I mean for gods sake, the dude was shot in his kidney. You pretty much knew he was dead when Cole said he saw dead people. The twist was delivered horribly as well. The ring falls on the floor. okay? So she had his ring? Who talks in their sleep like that anyways? You're telling me that in all the time that he spent away from his wife, he didn't notice that everybody was ignoring him? Nobody heard a kid talking to air since normal people can't see ghosts? This is a very noteworthy paradox that nobody seems to address. Why didn't the boy tell him that he was dead? Surely he could see that the counselor was dead, so why didn't he tell him? Why wasn't he afraid? Why was he scared when he said he was getting a new counselor? He wasn't talking to a counselor in real life anyways. Another thing, is this seriously the only case that a child psychologist deals with? You see at the beginning, he has a folder full of cases, and this is the only one he is dealing with?<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie was a very creative, very fun ride from start to finish. I just see lots of plot holes. This was a great film for its time, but to me, this film is not something that I will remember forever, and it is not staple in film. For the repeated plot holes, and poor clichés, I take off 3 stars."

","You probably know the five human senses: Touch, Scent, Sight, Sound and Taste, and this is a terrifying idea for a sixth, from director M. Night Shyamalan (also starring as Dr. Hill). Basically Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist recently awarded, and on the same night visited by a mad ex-patient who wounds him by gunshot. A few months later Malcolm is visited by the troubled 9-year-old Cole Sear (Forrest Gump's Haley Joel Osment). He does not tell his secret for a while, but when he does, it is one of the iconic moments of the film, it was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, ""I see dead people"". It is because of this he is a freak in school, and his mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is very concerned about his increasing problems. Malcolm is now trying to find out whether he is seeing things or not, and trying to rekindle his relationship with wife Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams). Also starring Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Gray, Glenn Fitzgerald as Sean, young Mischa Barton as Kyra Collins and Jurassic Park III's Trevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo. The film has a great conclusion as well with Cole's mother weeping at the idea of Cole seeing his Grandma, and Malcolm finding out why his wife has been ignoring him for so long, he wasn't wounded in that gunshot, he died. It was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!"

","I have to say I am not a fan generally of M Night Shyamalan's films, but I absolutely loved The Sixth Sense. It is a beautifully made film with an afterlife that is anything but angels and harps, and the score has lots of subtlety and atmosphere to it. The script is chilling, intelligent and poignant and the story complete with a knockout twist ending(easily the best and only wholly believable ending of Shyamalan's movies) is simplicity at its finest. Shyamalan's direction is wonderfully controlled, which is exactly what the story needed. Haley Joel Osment gives perhaps his best performance here, though he's superb in AI too, while Toni Collette plays the troubled mum very convincingly and Bruce Willis is suitably quiet and reflective. Overall, a wonderful film and Shyamalan's best by a mile in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Autlan","3","1","5","20 December 2009"," Wow! What a picture.
","There were so many pleasing things to concentrate on in this film. Let me see if I can recall a few.<br/><br/>First off, that adorable child. What a remarkable job, casting that lead. He was what - only ten or so? Remarkable. And we weren't let down by the rest of the cast either. His mother was just fantastic; I don't think I've empathised with a single mother like that before. Bruce Willis, playing the child psychiatrist, really had his work cut out acting next to her, but boy did he pull it off. He really deserved that award. Good job.<br/><br/>But credit where credit's due, without the top notch script I doubt even this cast could have pulled it off. When seriously original works like this one get green-lit you know that some people still care about bringing depth -- that only an engaging drama/thriller can -- back to our cinemas. I missed the boat on that one, but it certainly did well in my living room.<br/><br/>Dramas can always be measured by the dizzying heights of their joy and the plunging depths of their despair. This rolling masterpiece went so far, so fast, it brought me into a state of spatial disorientation. It will hold you on the edge of your seat until gradually you shuffle back into a comfortable position. Periodically, it will make your hair stand on end until you tug it flat in bunches, wide-eyed with anticipation. There are enough sad moments too, but I won't spoil the surprise.<br/><br/>None of this would have been possible without the groundbreaking soundtrack: it really tied the room together. Whenever I felt the uncertainty of a solitary tear the strength of sorrowful strings would fill our eyes to bursting. Gradually the brass would begin to climb... where was I being taken, how far, did anyone know, were they coming too? A sudden, sharp parp would bring us a foot not only out of our chairs, but our skins too. LOL <br/><br/>Now you've reached my twist ending, where I can reveal that I actually felt the complete opposite of what I've written. The same catatonic slight-handedness you can expect from following this devoid centerline for two hours. Those who saw through my laboured ruse, give yourself a pat on the back and think about how you spoiled absolutely the greatest comment of all time for yourselves."

There is a parallel universe that your spirit can go to that is very much apparently simular to this world. I would imagine God runs one side and gods wife runs the other or in other words one is ying and one is yang. It is very difficult to know even which one you are in apparently. I cross over every once in a while out of my control entirely.

"MovieAddict2016","6","1","5","11 March 2004"," Don't let a disappointing initial viewing turn you off...
","Some movies manage to scare us, and some movies manage to move us, and ""The Sixth Sense"" is a film that successfully does both. It took me three separate viewings to finally realize the genius of it all. I was not exactly impressed after seeing it for the first time on network television, after hearing so many good things about it. Then I stumbled into a theater playing ""Signs,"" and I was blown away by M. Night Shyamalan's directing style, and I decided to revisit ""The Sixth Sense"" again and again--and finally, all in one viewing, everything struck me as a wonderful, perfect whole.<br/><br/>The film begins ominously in the cellar of a dark house. We see Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) wander into the basement and grab a bottle of wine. We follow her upstairs where she finds her husband, Malcolm (Bruce Willis), drunk on rich wine and admiring his newly-acquired plaque, given to him by the city of Philadelphia in honor of his work in the field of child psychology. He thinks it would look good on the bathroom wall.<br/><br/>Then everything falls apart. Malcolm is shot by an old kid whom he failed to help. Some number of months goes by before we meet up with Malcolm again, as he walks down a street in Philly, watching Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole has been having trouble at school. He seems to be haunted by something, but Malcolm is unable to place a finger on what's wrong.<br/><br/>Then Cole tells him. He sees dead people. (""They walk around like they don't even know they're dead."") Considering Cole a sort of ""do-over"" for that kid he failed to help so many years ago, Malcolm makes it his personal vendetta to get to the bottom of Cole's troubles, and perhaps even face the most terrifying of all realities: the kid is telling the truth.<br/><br/>John Travolta had ""Pulp Fiction"" and Willis had ""The Sixth Sense."" This film reanimated Willis' somewhat faltering career, and for good reason: it's one of his best performances. Sure, the fake wig gets a little tiring, but the mystery surrounding Malcolm and his interest in a patient will connect with most viewers. We're a lot like Malcolm, at first, trying to figure out what's wrong with the boy. Then, later on, we find out that we were really viewing everything through Cole's eyes.<br/><br/>A major problem with movies about kids is that kids often can't act very well and rely on their cute, forced one-liners for audience approval. Not Haley Joel Osment (who was nominated for an Oscar due to this film). He actually acts, unlike most kids his age, which is refreshingly satisfying. He's no Macaulay Culkin--and I mean that in a good way.<br/><br/>You may not be as scared by ""The Sixth Sense"" as you will be haunted. The movie connects with a primary fear of our inner psyches that we all experience starting as early as childhood: the supernatural. A realm where rules of the mortals do not apply. There's a sort of satisfaction in knowing that only so many things can happen in this world that we live in. We know there's a limit as to what can appear before us, or what restrictions apply. But anything could be possible in a separate realm, and that is what most supernatural horrors miss. They mistake true nail-biting fear for creepy images of ghosts. M. Night Shyamalan doesn't. He strikes a chord with the audience by respecting them more than that.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is a self-confessed Steven Spielberg fan, and also admitted that Spielberg was a huge influence on all his films. I'm not too terribly surprised. Indeed, ""The Sixth Sense"" carries a sort of elegant structure that some of Spielberg's early features such as ""Duel"" and ""JAWS"" contained--some sort of majesty about the curiosity of it all. We never saw the truck driver; we rarely saw the shark (and when we finally did it was truly startling); and here the supernatural overtones of the movie carry a sort of otherworldly mystery that this genre often lacks. I can see how ""The Sixth Sense"" may have been ample straight-to-video effort. A kid who sees ghosts. It's not exactly brilliantly conceived.<br/><br/>But its execution and surprise ending (that almost everyone knows about by now and few actually guessed ahead of time) are what make ""The Sixth Sense"" something more than just another supernatural thriller. It's more of a tender, subtle character piece with spiritual overtones. Shyamalan has created an eerie second presence in the movie that is a lot scarier than showing ghosts parade about. ""Signs"" wasn't about aliens. ""The Sixth Sense,"" despite what people tell you, is not *really* about ghosts. I think that's part of what makes it engage the viewer, and seem so very intriguing, even to this day. After setting a groove for films of the genre to later follow (and knock-off), ""The Sixth Sense"" stands strong and proud and strikingly different. You have to admire both its ambition and respect for the audience, two fundamental elements of which are often lacking in many of today's motion pictures.<br/><br/>5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

"Jacques98","1","1","7","1 November 2008"," Only spectacular if you're not a horror buff who's seen old ghost movies.
","I'm not the biggest Shyamalan fan by any means. Of his entire body of work, only The Village and Unbreakable really stand out when originality is concerned, and they're really the only two of his movies that I've enjoyed. The major problem with The Sixth Sense is, who would have guessed, unoriginality. There is nothingminus the plot twist, I guessthat makes this stand apart from the thousands of other kid-seeing-ghosts movies that came out before it. If you've consider yourself a horror fan, and one that has seen a good selection of ghost movies, you know everything that happens here. And I mean everything.<br/><br/>However, there is some good. Mainly being that The Sixth Sense was one of the few groundbreaking American horror filmsand yes, it is drama/horror, not a thrillerthat brought some weight to the genre. While the majority of horror films in the '90s just focused on cheesy scares, Shyamalan focused on fine detailed, believable, high-quality scares that made the genre cinematic and not just laughable. With that said, The Sixth Sense, like most horror movies, just isn't very scary. A lot like the original Saw was a thriller set in a horror universe, The Sixth Sense is a drama set in a horror universe.<br/><br/>That brings out a lot of problems, however. For one, The Sixth Sense follows the same cliché formula a lot of Stephen King novels do: heavy doses of drama, with short bursts of horror scattered throughout. That just makes the already deeply unoriginal movie feel even worse because it makes it very boring. The attention to detail I mentioned above as a complement is also a major complaint.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's directing/writing skills are both probably both at their best here on a technical level (if you ignore the unoriginality). There wasn't a single shot in the movie that wasn't effectively done, and the plot is laid out well. The plot twist ending brought the plot twist ending into the mainstream, and it's very well done, but still a little cliché. The plot twist has been used in a lot of urban legends before, as well, if I remember right, on The Twilight Zone a few times.<br/><br/>So, in the end, it just left me with mixed feelings. On one hand I want to praise the movie for being so well done, but on the other hand I want to trash it for the lack of anything that sets it overall apart from every other ghost story out there. Everything was so predictable.<br/><br/>Let this be a lesson to all of you who say a movie can be a good movie even if it's unoriginal: you're wrong. Without originality, you're just left with no mystery, and just left feeling: ""Eh, whatever. Didn't I see that before somewhere?"" And that last thought is exactly my final opinion on the insanely overrated The Sixth Sense. But at least it wasn't as godawful as The Happening, right? <br/><br/>1/10"

So, obviosuly all questions are: How didn't Bruce Willis notice he is dead before, like his wife never responded to him, nobody exept for boy ever talked to him. Also who hired him to check the boy in the first place, he was dead for quite some time.

","Sixth Sense is a good film, but I find it very overrated. Everyone and their mother praises this film as being not only one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films but one of the best thrillers period. On the cover it of the DVD it even says; ""The Best Thriller Ever!"" No. When I finally saw the film many years ago I was quite underwhelmed. I found it to be a decent suspense/horror film. The acting was fine. Bruce Willis does a good job in the film. However, I do not see it as the masterpiece that everyone thinks it is. I recently re-watched the film without any of those expectations, and I liked the film even more. I do think this a really good movie, and one of Shyamalan's best. However, I still don't think it's Shyamalan's peak. In my opinion, his greatest film is Unbreakable, which deserves more recognition.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist named Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Crowe meets a Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Cole claims to be able to see dead people wherever he goes.<br/><br/>Another preconceived notion I had when I first viewed the film years and years ago was that I thought it was a horror film, because I had heard that so many people found the film incredibly scary. I saw the film under that notion and didn't find it scary in the least. But this not a horror film at all. It's simply a psychological thriller with supernatural elements. We don't even see any supernatural things happen until more than an hour in. At first you think it's all in the kid's mind.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Haley do a fine job acting wise. I did like these two characters. I thought they were both likable and had energy, which is more than I can say for the character in Shyamalan's latest works. The story was and how the final twist is handled is some Shyamalan's best writing. I often forget how talented of s story and character writer Shyamalan could be given some of his later work. It's like in between Signs and Split all of his writing talent was just sucked out of him by some unknown force, and he somehow got it back.<br/><br/>Overall I liked the Sixth Sense, but I do not think it is as good a people make it out to be. It is a film that should be seen at least once though."

","I'm nearly 40 yrs old and just watched The Sixth Sense for the first time. Please read my review from this context.<br/><br/>I have long known about the film's unforgettable ending. That is the legend of this movie. Naturally, I watched it and focused on the character interactions with Bruce Willis' character to see if I could find holes in the behaviors or scenes.<br/><br/>The anniversary dinner scene: I watched closely to see if his wife did anything that would be unnatural. Most of this scene checks out but there was a moment she looked up and straight across the table as if acknowledging Bruce was talking. She quickly looked back down. Nitpicking but hey, it's a review.<br/><br/>The scene in the boy's house: this is kind of a giveaway that Bruce is a ghost. How in the world would the mother not introduce a first time guest to her son?<br/><br/>Another thought I had is this: in what world does a child psychiatrist meet a boy that needs help but the two never meet in his office? Bruce is just waking around and meeting him from place to place?<br/><br/>The acting in the film is average. Bruce Willis did fine but nothing spectacular. He was born to be John McClane in Die Hard, not so much Malcom in Sixth Sense. Haley Joel got a lot of praise at the time of the movie release as I recall. I'm sure he deserved it, but I have a hard time getting past his squeaky voice. It's an ear frequency thing.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film despite knowing its memorable ending beforehand. It started with appreciating the connection he and his wife had in the beginning. Then, Donnie Wahlburg gave a TREMENDOUS performance in his brief cameo. I was hooked from the start. While the movie may have slowed down a bit while we were introduced to characters and the relationship between Bruce and Haley developed, it picked up again as we were exposed to Haley's sixth sense. I though the tension in the ghost scenes were done very well, and like other reviewers have said, without the need to be gory or bloody.<br/><br/>When we finally get to the plot twist at the end I was satisfied. I think I just appreciate a situation where a loving husband (ghost husband) looks over his sleeping wife and tells her to move on. It's okay. I thought it was a nice touch to a very good movie."

","I've a friend who has this habit of later on claiming about such endings of films that he guessed it beforehand when this or that particular sequence happened. I never believe him, and I think it's just some kind of an attempt in not giving up to the film beating your intelligence, your observing and sharp thinking. So I wouldn't claim that either in this film's case. My younder sister did remark at the halfway mark of the possibility of the doctor being one of the spirits. I wasn't convinced by her but it turned out, she was right after all!<br/><br/>However, one thing that was stuck in my mind throughout and something that I saw as a genuine 'flaw' was the lack of report by the doctor to the child's parent - or whoever brought him into play. Because, as it is, the patient wasn't an adult, in which case it was incumbent upon the doctor to report the latest to an elder, especially the finding of the patient's 'supposed' schizophrenia. Turns out, it wasn't quite clearly a flaw in the film.<br/><br/>A good, engaging film. The acting by the child artist was out of the world, just awesome!<br/><br/>I don't quite know what to put it down to, but despite it being such a unique concept and having a climax as fabulous as it has, it didn 't quite, for me, make it to the level of 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994) or 'Shutter Island' (2010). Possibly, possibly because as the climax approaches, the film begins to go in a lost direction, which fails in making you hold your breaths for such an ending. In the end, it wasn't as perfect despite such a brilliant ending. Certainly didn't convince me to give it 10 stars, something that I do very, very often."

The screenplay of the movie is so cleverly written that you'd be more than satisfied with the movie without its iconic ending. Even Roger Ebert admitted that he was completely taken aback by the ending and that is no small feat. While I thought the ending was really rushed, nobody can argue the impact that had on the film industry and to story telling thereafter.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is a smartly scripted movie backed up by wonderful performances and a movie that could definitely use a second viewing just to appreciate the thought that was put into it."

"Leofwine_draca","9","0","1","21 December 2016"," A thoughtful ghost story that became a Hollywood blockbuster
","My latest outing to the local multiplex was to see this, the second biggest horror film of 1999 after THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Unfortunately for me, the film had already been ruined partially by trailers, which give away all the key moments of the film. I for one could do without them, as I spent most of the time waiting for the kid to say ""I see dead people"", ""...all the time"" and ""she's standing by my window"". Seeing as these are the best moments of the film, a lot of the impact was softened.<br/><br/>Saying that, THE SIXTH SENSE is still an expertly-crafted, entertaining film with some great acting (something lacking in a lot of recent blockbusters), and I'm glad that it's enjoying huge success at the moment - hopefully horror film-makers will turn their minds to something a bit more insightful and psychological rather than the latest gore fest. This is an extremely slow-moving film with no action in it whatsoever, no screaming girls being chased by maniacs, just important dialogue and realistic people in real situations. There are plenty of reasons to watch the film for. When we eventually start seeing the 'ghosts' that Cole himself sees, there is ample opportunity for some chills, and the ghosts themselves are really quite frightening - both in their behaviour, and of course their gory looks. These spooks are of the kind THE HAUNTING remake could have done with.<br/><br/>The acting is of the highest calibre, with a relatively unknown cast headed by that great action star, Bruce Willis. Willis turns in his most sombre, thoughtful performance ever, and surprised many people who didn't realise he could actually act. In fact I would say that this the best I've ever seen him - his character is sympathetic, and Willis really does excel himself in portraying a believable, faded and disheartened man. Toni Collette also puts in a good role as the frustrated mother of Cole, and even though she doesn't play a likable character and has a relatively supporting role in the proceedings, she remains a totally believable and understandable character, and the same can be said of Olivia Williams. However, it's Haley Joel Osment who really shines as the star of the piece, and his acting is spot on, conveying a boy totally in fear of his own unnatural abilities, and who labels himself a 'freak'. Thankfully, Osment doesn't get too many opportunities to do 'cute' scenes, which I was grateful for.<br/><br/>Aside from the many genuine chills at Cole's revelations that he can see dead people, there are a few too many 'jump' scenes for my liking, where somebody brushes past the camera and somebody screams. A variation on the cat in the cupboard, really. However what seems to be initially an average film is suddenly boosted by the now famous twist in the tale, which really changes your entire perception of the film and makes you think about how clever it was long after the images have faded from the screen. This ending was brilliant, one of the best I've seen, and I should probably watch the film again now that I know the outcome, in order to spot all the clues, as it were. THE SIXTH SENSE may not be the greatest horror film ever, but it's one of the best we've had in a long time."

He is assigned to help Cole (Haley Joel Osment), a child who can ""see dead people."" The surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has got a lot of attention and it has overshadowed the rest of the film. I'll talk about the twist, but it is only a part of what makes up the film. The twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" is particularly clever, it's not fun if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist makes sense. And surprising. I've seen a few movie twists and some are surprising, but don't make any sense, because the director didn't provide enough hints. It is incredible that these scenes can be seen in many different ways after the twist is revealed. The movie is effective because it works on this basic level. What makes ""The Sixth Sense"" moving is that it never cheats. Everything we see is real, and feels real, real meetings, conversations, and its our assumptions that fool us. Illusions are scattered throughout the film and that is what Shyamalan is when he directed this movie, an illusionist.<br/><br/>Real horror is The Sixth Sense, events that could happen. Instead of excessive violence, nudity, lazy jump scares, boo, ah. The Sixth Sense looks at, separation, depression, bullying. Sad things, scary things to happen to you in real life. A scene when they attend a funeral with a disturbing video tape was frightening. Now when you hear that, you may think, some gory old woman will give us a fake jumpscare, no. No gore, no jumpscares. Movies are missing out on this in recent years, yes the jumpscare will startle you because its unexpected, but it's a scary face and / or a loud noise. This is a touching moment when a father realises a terrifying secret of why his daughter died. Because this is a non spoiler review I will just say that it is brilliantly directed and pure terrifying.<br/><br/>You could just watch this movie if you love the craft of acting because Osment puts on one of the greatest acting performances by a child that cinema has ever seen. Malcolm, his wife and Cole's mother are all brilliant in this and believable. A scene near the end of the movie, between mother and son, finally understanding each other, it was so beautiful.<br/><br/>Now when I think of a horror film, I think of R rating movies, jumpscares, monsters and gore. I was really surprised that a movie as upsetting as ""The Sixth Sense"" wasn't given a restricted rating.<br/><br/>It was great watching this movie when I did, I just watched The Visit, another film of Shyamalan.<br/><br/>I have never seen a moving picture that has had this much attention to detail. The director removed certain colours from scenes to create different effects so it made sense in the long term. This movie shows that when you make a great horror movie you will be rewarded with the money you so desperately want. It is great to see people come together and create something incredible and do their job. <br/><br/>The ending adds more interest after the movie concluded, and I was searching up all the easter eggs straight after. But that isn't the only way you can enjoy this film. This is one of my favourite horror films. Like all good horror films, ""The Sixth Sense"" lets suspense build. I said it before and I'll say it again. It doesn't rely on excessive violence, blood and gore, or cheap jump scares. It has terrific acting, story, pace, messages, hidden messages! This is a movie that will not be taken from its rightful place as the best horror film of all time and if you were like me and pondering on the idea of see it. Go see it, anyway you can, it's a movie you need to see before you die, and before someone ruins it for you, go and watch the movie! <br/><br/>A+<br/><br/>Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AA"
"MaximumMadness","10","0","2","15 November 2016"," ""The Sixth Sense""- An incredible, frightening and even heartfelt thriller. One of the finest horror films of the 90's. Perhaps even of all time.
","At the time of its release, M. Night Shyamalan's tense and arresting thriller ""The Sixth Sense"" was something of a cultural phenomena. A revelation in the world of horror, and one of those few films that emerges every so often to remind us of just how invaluable and under-appreciate this genre is. And of the great heights it is capable of in the hands of great storytellers and master filmmakers. <br/><br/>While Shyamalan's career has gone through its highs and lows in the ensuing years, one fact has remained constant in the near-twenty years that have passed since this 1999 release: No matter what, ""The Sixth Sense"" is still looked upon with nothing but admiration and adoration from critics and filmgoers alike, being held in the highest regards. Some even consider it a modern classic, set to go down among the other greats like Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or Wise's ""The Haunting."" And I am very much in agreement with this. It's a beautiful and meticulously crafted experience that not only delivers the thrills and chills like any good ghost story should... but it also delivers plenty of heart and very human drama that keeps you wholly invested.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis stars as Child Psychologist Malcolm Crowe, a man haunted by a home invasion one year prior in which a troubled former patient shot him and then committed suicide in front of he and his wife. With a growing rift in his marriage due to the trauma, Crowe seeks redemption by helping a young boy with similar emotional problems to his deceased patient- Cole Sear, as portrayed brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment. However, Crowe doesn't realize the severity of young Cole's plight, and soon comes to learn a startling truth... Cole can see the ghosts of people with unfinished business. Malcolm realizes he must help Cole to try and control this unique gift... this terrible curse... and to try and figure out what the spirits haunting young Cole want.<br/><br/>Shyamalan crafts his tale and directs the film with a certain sensitivity and tact that works wonders for conveying the themes and scares alike. His script is always intense but with just enough levity to allow the audience to catch their breath between the more frightening of scenes, and he expertly handles his characters with a deliberation that I admired. Every single character present has their purpose in the story, and all are handled exceptionally well. Especially our two leads, who both go through very well thought-out arcs that realistically develop and change who they are throughout the narrative. There's also a surprising among of heart present in the script that will draw you in with its identifiable moments of human drama. As much as it is about haunting spirits tormenting a young child, it's also a film about a man trying to fix his own life and marriage, and about a young boy dealing with his unique gifts while trying to maintain a connection with his troubled mother. There's some very powerful work done in terms of these sequences and they help to elevate the film as a whole.<br/><br/>The visual direction is just wonderful. Say what you will about his later, shoddier work, but Shyamalan knows how to convey a scene with keen use of lighting, composition and movement. His recurring motifs, such as the color red or the use of lowered temperatures are really good indicators that something terrible is about to happen, and they will instantly put you on edge as an audience member, with the hair on the back of your neck standing straight up.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the cast is just magnificent and are a key piece of the puzzle as to what makes the film such an immense achievement. Willis, often known for his gruff tough-guy roles, is given the role of a lifetime as the troubled Malcolm, and is able to stretch his acting chops in a way that many of his more recent works cannot touch. It's a film that reminds us of just how much we love Willis as an actor first and foremost, and he plays it to perfection. Osment, now known more for his work in quirky B-movies and voice- over roles, excels as one of the finest child actors I've ever seen in his defining part. He gives Cole such a sense of pathos and maturity that is far beyond his years. He also nails the scenes of a frightened child, terrified of the ghostly figures that are following him. And Toni Collette, who I adored in her incredible series ""United States of Tara"" makes for a wonderful supporting role as Cole's mother, Lynn. A troubled person trying to hold herself together for the sake of her child.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Sixth Sense"" excels thanks to these wonderful contributing factors, and emerges as a flawless and frightening excursion into the other side. It's scares will keep you up at night, afraid of what may be lurking in the dark around you. And it's very human and emotional drama will touch you in a way many other recent horror films simply cannot compare to. It's an undeniable modern classic, and not only is it one of the best horror releases of the 1990's... it may be one of the greatest horror films ever made.<br/><br/>And for this reason, it easily and skillfully earns a perfect 10 out of 10."

","The problem with a film so synonymous with a shocking twist or an ending reveal is that there isn't much value to re-watching such a film. Sure, there are plenty of good things about The Sixth Sense, but I can't help but think without the famous twist, this movie would have been just your average thriller.<br/><br/>Being a huge film fan, it was always hard admitting that I haven't seen M. Night Shyamalan's ""masterpiece"", The Sixth Sense. But because I've known the twist for years now, I had a difficult time mustering up the motivation to watch a film knowing its ending. I can't stand knowing endings going into the viewing experience. With that said, there are a lot of things about this film that are good, so I'm mad at myself for taking so long. But also keeping that in mind, I hardly believe this film was best picture quality, nor deserves to be on ""all-time great"" lists.<br/><br/>Besides the twist, The Sixth Sense is perhaps most notable for being the coming out party for Haley Joel Osment, who plays a child with the ability to see and speak to the newly perished. He, Toni Collette, and Bruce Willis are the best things about this film. The performances alone make it worth the price of admission, with Collette being the clear standout for me. And Willis perhaps hasn't given as good of a performance since.<br/><br/>The problem for me is that knowing the twist going in really tramples any sort of enjoyment I had. The ""thrills"" weren't all that thrilling and the plot seemed to never truly pick up pace until it was too late. That falls on the shoulders of Shyamalan and his directing. I feel like people were so enthralled with the late-game revelation, that they forgot how plotting the first hour and a half feels. There's a lot here I liked, but it's nowhere near the high praise that people give it.<br/><br/>+Performances carry the film<br/><br/>+Emotional connection is felt towards the end<br/><br/>-Plot drags<br/><br/>-No re-watchability<br/><br/>6.4/10"
"sharky_55","7","0","1","10 October 2016"," You have to add some twists and stuff.
","The internet and young audiences have long been enamoured with this type of film that rewards repeat viewings. It's good film-making to flip the viewer onto its back and watch them question everything they have just witnessed, and what's more, twists generate discussion, which in turn generate hype. These films, in the vein of Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, The Prestige as well as Shyamalan's own The Village, all have their designated 'rewind' moments, where the bombshell twist is dropped and the realisation sinks into the characters. This is often accompanied by flashbacks that remind us visually of all the little hints that we have missed, but most find that joy in a second or even third watch. It's a bit like positive reinforcement - the viewer relishes in spotting them slyly inserted into the background or unknowingly in plain sight, and are allowed to pat themselves on the back for being so attentive. <br/><br/>The worst of these twist movies are built from that point up - their screenplays are only written after the original idea, and bits and pieces of the world and characterisation need to be fitted around it. When re-watching these, they fail miserably because the viewer is now armed with prior knowledge that renders it illogical and unnecessary. One of the worst offenders of this type is The Usual Suspects, a cult classic because of the last few minutes where everything that had been previously established in the film is suddenly up-ended and tossed aside. Knowing this and watching the film again renders it all joyless and without meaning; the entire thing is little more than a shaggy- dog story built from the ego of Keyser Soze. Another contender is Fincher's The Game. Its tension is serviceable the first time, but a revisit only strains the suspension of disbelief, and highlights the ridiculousness and somewhat sadistic tone. <br/><br/>Is The Sixth Sense a successful movie in spite of its twist being the worst kept secret in pop culture in the years after its premiere? Its characters at least, seem authentic, and not contraptions that only service the path towards the twist ending. Bruce Willis is cast against type; he is responsible for mending things, instead of tearing them apart, but it is exactly the type of baggage that his persona carries (the rough, hard-headed approach) which convinces us he would rather throw a brick into a window instead of talking to his wife (although this does not entirely redeem the convenience of the situation). Collette plays a role she would later perfect in About a Boy - a single mother straining against the weight and responsibility of parenthood, but Shyamalan enables an additional level of sympathy by letting her react rationally to irrational and supernatural occurrences. We can see what is causing the bruising and emotional distress, but we also understand that she has no other reasonable response, and so this justifies the tension that holds back their true communication. Haley Joel Osment's young performance is exactly as asked; a boy saddled with a burden that no ten year old should have to shoulder, and courageously trying to do what is right. Much of Cole's precocious nature is sourced from Osment himself, and that is perhaps why the acclaim for the role is a little overdone. But he is still very good, and makes the jumps from childhood to adult emotional sensibilities smoothly. <br/><br/>The film has been called horror, which seems undeniable in the way that Shyamalan approaches Cole's visions stylistically. He uses the money shots carefully and sparingly, from a long-held horror tradition that came initially from limited budgets (this was his third directorial feature, but the budget does not reflect that). The characters might walk past ghosts hanging from nooses in the corridor ceiling, and everyone but Cole will not afford a second glance. A lone hand might grab at a little boy from under the bed - a little clichÃ©, I must admit. And the soundtrack is familiar enough. Its aesthetic is unmistakably horror, stabbing and piercing and leaping suddenly in volume to aid the jump scares. If they are not scary enough that's because the film ultimately tries to brand itself with the sentiment of redemption instead. Maybe one day ghosts might try a more friendly tone if they want things done from the afterlife."

However, Cole has certain special, supernatural abilities...<br/><br/>Great movie with a brilliant twist at the end. For the most part it feels like a slow-burning horror movie. Writer-director M Night Shyamalan, directing his third movie (though the first two were very low-key), expertly builds the tension and intrigue. <br/><br/>The twist, when it comes, is so unexpected, but works so well and fits so perfectly with the plot. Even watching the movie a second time you are hard-pressed to fault how the twist fits in with the plot.<br/><br/>Some great drama too, and quite emotional at times, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>Solid performance by Bruce Willis in the lead role. Good work from Haley Joel Osment as the boy. Good support from Toni Collette and Olivia Williams. Osment and Collette got Supporting Actor/Actress Oscar nominations for their performances.<br/><br/>Just a pity Shyamalan couldn't reproduce this form in any of his subsequent movies. His next movie, ""Unbreakable"", was good, but not brilliant. ""Signs"" was mediocre and ""The Village"" was okay, but not great. After that his movies were very bad - ""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"" and ""The Last Airbender"" were very silly and pointless. One keeps hoping for a return to the creative brilliance that was The Sixth Sense but, considering how his movies seem to get worse with every attempt, this may be hoping too much."

","DISCLAIMER: Analytical writing, along with most other forms of writing, are definitely not my strong suit so if this review feels rushed, choppy, or not well thought out it was not my intent.<br/><br/>Very rarely do I see a movie where after wards I feel as if my life was changed in a meaningful way. Most of the time the films I watch serve as two hour diversions, brief respites in the midst of often long, tiresome, and occasionally depressing (at least for me) days. THE SIXTH SENSE triumphantly resides in the former category. In both of my viewings from the opening confrontation in Malcolm and Anna's apartment to the pitch-perfect finale, I was inseparably wrapped up in the events on screen. Through flawless direction, disturbingly convincing performances, and a beautiful yet mysterious score, this movie managed to not only invest me in the action, but even went as far as to occasionally make me forget I was even watching a film; such an occurrence happened during the car scene between Cole and Lynn.<br/><br/>I know that I haven't elaborated much on the details of the plot, or even on a few of the film's inconsistencies, but in my opinion the best way of viewing this film is to not know too much about it going in. Avoid message boards, FAQs, and even the original theatrical trailer as best as possible, all of which are laden full of spoiler-filled information that'll reduce the intrigue. That's not to say that knowing the plot beforehand, which is what happened to me, will prevent you from greatly enjoying the film, but it will lessen the feeling of discovery that can come from the experience.<br/><br/>Watching this movie on New Year's Eve was a lot of fun last night, and right next to black eyed pea dip I'm definitely going to make it a New Year's tradition.<br/><br/>10/10"

","The Sixth Sense is not your average paranormal horror thriller, it is a thought-provoking with a strong emotional edge associated with its spine-chilling scares. The ingenious mastermind this supernatural horror-fest is M. Night Shyalaman who pours a heart and soul into the core of its chilling story. In an age where many filmmakers strive for both successful and unsuccessful attempts at scare with with drenching their films in an enormous barrage of blood and gore and jump scares, Shyalaman sheds away from these conventions by showcasing a story that spends chills down your spine, while grabbing at your heart with an emotional atmosphere many films of the genre are often not accustomed to. So here's the question, what if you had the ability to see spirits of the deceased? The answers lie within the grounded core of this supernatural thriller carried on the shoulders of young Haley Joel Osment as it follows a little boy lost in a world of unspeakable imaginations. There are rules, however, that must be established when bringing an eerie world of the dead beyond the grave to life. That's a generous method the Indian-born filmmaker applies to pulling audiences into an emotional jarring experience where paranoia is rampant and the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred. The film, set in Shyalaman's hometown in Philadelphia, follows Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis), a once-gifted child psychologist who is set up with an emotionally disturbed nine-year old boy named Cole Sears (played by Haley Joel Osment), a lonely boy living his misunderstood mother (played by Toni Collette). Upon meeting the young lad, it becomes clear that the boy needs help. But things become complicated when Malcolm discovers that Cole has a mysterious ability to communicate with the ghost of dead people.<br/><br/>It it rare for a horror film to carry such a significant amount of intellect and heart as this film, unless you look at the age of the Stephen King-based horror entities that made a crucial impact in the genre during the 80s and 90s. M. Night Shyalaman brings his directorial talent to the table, and the beauty of his filmmaking style shines in more ways than one. For the scenes that are so supposed to be scary, the film gets scary. For the scenes that are supposed to touch your heart, the film grabs at your heart, and not in a way that feels contrived. Shyalaman keeps the story moving at a reasonable pace as it builds up on Cole's exploration of the real world clashing with the world of the deceased, while accompanying the atmosphere with twists and turns not many people will see coming. Rarely does he let any moment go wasted. At every step of the way, there is a sheer amount of suspense roaring in each scene as Cole is visited by deceased individual who pop out of nowhere and began haunting his presence. Pay attention to when the temperature drops and Cole's breath gets cold. And while the score by James Newton Howard is beautiful to listen to, it is the heartfelt performance by Haley Joel Osment that challenges our emotions. For a ten-year-old boy, this actor knows how to tap into the heart string with a performance that pounds with strong emotional magnitude, especially in a scene with his mother towards the end. Working along his side is Bruce Willis, a German-born famous for his adrenaline-fueled role as John McClane in the 'Die Hard' series, who expands upon his acting chops to deliver a performance that is simply riveting. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is a thoughtful, spine-chilling supernatural thrillers that marks a landmark achievement on the horror genre thanks to the rewarding directorial efforts by M. Night Shyalaman. For the phase ""you will not many horror movies like this one"", this quote definitely applies to this cinematic bolt. The movie is not all about scares, it is also about heart and redemption"

","Blending the emotional depth of a heartfelt story with the chilling vibes of a modern horror, The Sixth Sense is M Night Shayamalan's breakthrough feature film that's patiently crafted, skilfully narrated & efficiently performed and still remains his finest directional effort to date. Noted for its foreboding atmosphere, brilliant use of visual motifs & that final masterstroke, it's an excellent example of quality storytelling.<br/><br/>Set in Philadelphia, the story of The Sixth Sense follows a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients on the day he was honoured for his work. The plot then jumps to next fall where we see him clearly affected by the whole incident as he takes on a new case of a 9-year old boy who's exhibiting signs of the same illness that his ex-patient did. When he commits to helping him, the boy confides his secret to him.<br/><br/>Written & directed by M Night Shayamalan, The Sixth Sense remains the only film that I've seen of his and the patience & maturity with which he has translated this scripted story on the film canvas is no short of amazing. The screenplay makes sure that each character has a well-defined arc, the symbolic & thematic elements are nicely addressed, those twists n turns are cleverly placed and it keeps its secret well-preserved until the final revelation.<br/><br/>Set pieces, shooting locations & overcast weather conditions really help in creating a dark setting, the fluid movements & sustained focus of its camera, in addition to proper lighting & correct colour tones, add more enhancements to its ominous setting, Editing provides a smooth flow to the whole narrative & unfolds it at a steady pace. James Newton Howard's score comprises of tracks that effortlessly integrate into the storyline to further amplify the whole experience.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osmont, Tori Collette & Olivia Williams, with Willis & Osmont impressing the most. Willis is very restraint in his performance here, Osmont wonderfully captures the plight of his character & is able to express it convincingly, the scenes between Willis & Osmont are surprisingly fascinating, Collette does well as the concerned mother and the arc of each one of these characters is fully realised on the screen.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Sixth Sense delivers the chills without for once discarding its firm grip on the viewers' senses, maintains a stunning balance between all filmmaking aspects, and continues to be counted amongst the most original, clever & intelligently made horror flicks of the past 20 years. While it'll definitely surprise the newcomers, the only drawback The Sixth Sense has in my opinion is that its effect begins to wear off more n more on each subsequent viewing. Nevertheless, it's a must for every horror fanatic."

","There have been few movies that have generated so much buzz and mystery.<br/><br/>Many films in this genre have scared the pants off of their poor audience, with a special nod to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but this movie is very different (and much more engaging). The Sixth Sense tells you with its story, its pace, and its acts that something will happen, but you can't put your finger on it until the very end. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense offers no ""cheap scares"" present in movies like Scream in which things just jump out at you. This film will make you anxious and it will make you afraid. Long after the film is over (think Psycho, which left so many afraid of showering after). At the same time, you will smile and find bittersweet hope in it."
"framptonhollis","8","0","1","22 September 2015"," Good Job, Shyamalan!
","M. Night Shyamalan gets a lot of hate for making a lot of horrible films. And, I must admit, a lot of his films look pretty horrible to me, but I haven't seen them yet, and this film is pretty great!<br/><br/>Although flawed, ""The Sixth Sense"" manages to be full of some genuinely powerful moments, and a very smart script. Seriously, it is amazing how they were able to pull of the twist ending and STILL have the whole film make a lot of sense. But, it isn't a film just about horror and twist endings, it is also a very good drama film, and I'm surprised a film this bleak and emotional has actually gotten tons of attention from the general public.<br/><br/>However, as I mentioned earlier, the film is flawed. One of the biggest flaws is the delivery. Now, the acting in this film is very well-done, but it'd be even better if not every character spoke...so...slowly...and...whispered...every...line. Also, I DID unintentionally laugh at some sequences, but those scenes are very few, although they were kind of odd.<br/><br/>Overall, SEE IT!"

"byson5186","8","0","1","10 September 2015"," Slow, Entertaining Thriller
","It amazes me to think about how old this movie is. It's from 1999. This is most likely the actor Haley Joel Osment's, most memorable film. I haven't seen him in films in awhile, and if you look at recent pictures from him, you'll think about how he was a cute kid, but he hasn't aged well. That being said, I'm a little older than Haley Joel Osment and if you saw me you'd think I look young for my age. Like there are employees at work who once guessed I was 14, and then said I look 18. 14 is a little too young, I don't think I look that young. But, to people who feel old one thing is for sure and that's not all of us age the same. Some look old for their age, while some look young. You could look at names of celebrities who don't age online and celebrities from Modern Family would come up, like Sofia Vergara/Gloria, and Sarah Hyland/Haley. You'd also see names like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. But, if you look at celebrities who have aged badly, you'd see Haley Joel Osment's name.<br/><br/>OK, talking about aging was off topic. But, I just wanted to leave a random message on an IMDb movie review. That's if you're feeling old, remember there's nothing you can do about your age. How old you are since when you were born. What you do with your body might age you faster or slower. But, we are not as old as we might think we are. Because, apparently not everybody ages the same.<br/><br/>So, to get to my point this movie is a great Thriller. It was like the top film back in 1999 next to The Phantom Menace. It's been well received and well remembered. It also more than likely is the director M. Night Shyamalan's most memorable/successful film. Some of his more recent films like The Last Airbender, and After Earth haven't done well. Another film of his is coming out tomorrow, The Visit. That film looks entertaining, but looks like it will be more cheesy and like it's a modern version of Hansel And Gretel. That film like this film is also taking place in my home state and has scenes in Philadelphia. Man, I don't hear about these movies in the news being filmed locally, or see any sign of a film crew around. I wonder if I could have been an extra in one of these movies? They show a scene in The Visit at the train station in Philadelphia 30th Street Station. I've been there lots of times, but never heard of a film project over there. It's interesting to think where movies have been filmed, and how the director of both movies who grew up around Philadelphia has his movies from there.<br/><br/>So, I've mostly been off topic. But, what makes this movie great. Well, up until a couple of years ago I hadn't seen this movie for more than a decade. I remembered it, but it wasn't a movie I cared to see. I mostly remembered the movie being dark and depressing. Like yeah, even if you haven't seen it you more than likely are familiar with the line, ""I See Dead People"" from this movie. Also, we see the character played by Haley Joel Osment sad in a lot of scenes including deleted scenes. It almost seemed like a young, lonely, isolated boy who had problems that wouldn't go away, and focusing on dead people. Also, it seemed a little like a quiet dark movie, which it is. This isn't a fast paced horror movie. But, it will definitely keep you entertained. My perceptions from this movie have changed from the last couple of times I saw it. I even last saw this movie when I was having a depressing day myself, when I normally don't have depressing days. The movie definitely helped put me in a better mood, and I was able to laugh at a couple of scenes. I got myself into the movie both times I saw it, and it's not as depressing of a movie as I remember. <br/><br/>This movie also is a clever story. Being able to see dead people. Though, if you look the the story wasn't something M. Night Shyamalan came up with on his own. He came up with the idea from an episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark. He already would have been an adult when that episode aired, and got his idea from a kids TV show. Though this movie won't feel like it's a kids movie even when the main character is a kid, and even if it was inspired by a kids TV show. It will also seem more serious than a TV show like Ghost Whisperer, which also involves a girl being able to see the dead.<br/><br/>I ought to say, I won't tell you what it is, even if you haven't seen it you probably already heard of the twist. This movie is famous for a Twist At The End. Almost nobody who saw this movie for the first time and wasn't already told what it was, could figure the twist out that's revealed at the end. There are even clues leading to the twist, but they most likely won't seem apparent to anybody who doesn't already know what it is. I heard the movie coming out tomorrow, The Visit is supposed to have an ending Twist, and I'm not sure what it is?<br/><br/>I'll give this movie an 8/10. It's not my favorite movie, but it is still an entertaining movie to watch."

","This film tells the story of Cole, a boy who has the gift of seeing spirits of the dead, and that is helped by Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychiatrist. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, with the participation of Bruce Willis (Dr. Crowe) and Haley Joel Osment (Cole).<br/><br/>It is one of thrillers most successful nineties, covering topics that always consider interesting and which are recurring in films of this genre. However, Shyamalan's approach is innovative and different, because the main character is an absolutely skeptical individual. The film contains some scenes which eventually became famous, even scoring Haley Osment career. But one of the most interesting points of this movie is the ending, a surprising twist that makes the movie less predictable, as well as being one of the trademarks of this director. Although he already has a few years and be well known, this is a film that always worth seeing."

His suffering leaves him an outcast at school. After another episode leaves him in the hospital, he tells Malcolm his secret that he ""sees dead people"".<br/><br/>This is one of the best reveals in movie history. It's not simply a shocking twist. Anybody can write a random twist that aims to shock people. This twist is well-planned and constructed from the first moments of the film. Shyamalan lays out not only clues but the right amount of clues. It is a twist that people are unlikely to foresee but then beat themselves for not forseeing it. He gets the perfect balance.<br/><br/>The other question is whether this is a good movie without the twist. The great thing is that the intensity does not rely on the twist. HJO has the perfect wise innocence quality. It has great creepiness. It's a traditional ghost story and a well made one. The intensity ramps up as the ghosts reveal themselves. This would be one of the great horrors even without the twist."
"luke-a-mcgowan","8","0","1","3 September 2015"," Storytelling done right and child acting at its best
","The thing about movies with major twists is that the film needs to stand up once you know the end. The Usual Suspects is an engrossing and complex crime story with a great screenplay and acting. The Empire Strikes back is a soaring space opera with iconic dialogue and memorable characters. Seven is a sprawling bore that's so dark it's almost pitch black. And The Sixth Sense is still a surprisingly touching, often horrifying and incredibly clever film. Picking apart Shyamalan's incredibly detailed screenplay for all the little clues about the big twist is so much fun.<br/><br/>The best thing that The Sixth Sense could ever have done was make Vincent and Cole similar cases. A massive misdirect for all who might have otherwise seen it coming, Shyamalan presents you with a doctor who failed one patient and seeks to make it up with his second, to the extent that he's grown distant from everyone. Just that alone makes me respect Shyamalan's storytelling ability. Beautifully shot and directed sequences, with the editing team knowing just when to cut away, are almost gleeful in feeding you hints buried under a seemingly legitimate and normal conduct. Shyamalan's use of the colour red shows beyond a filmmaking passion – it's attention to detail in a story he had to see done right. Shyamalan also has key focus for directing horror – sudden blasts of jolting music and dramatic reveals of ghosts and their life-claiming injuries are just horror done right. I was just as terrified as Cole. But Shyamalan also has a flair for directing some of the most tender scenes in the film – a funeral where Cole reveals the deceased girl's cause of death to her grieving father, and the aforementioned scenes between Cole and his mother could have been directed by Sam Mendes or Frank Darabont, they were so gentle.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment has just soared to one of my all time favourite child performances. The Sixth Sense has only confirmed to me that 1999 was a brilliant year for supporting actor performances – Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile, Tom Cruise in Magnolia – but Osment rightfully stood out as one of the year's best. I never doubted for one second that this strange child was one who has been tortured day in and day out by the souls of the dead. His tearful scenes against his disbelieving mother (an equally good Toni Collette) are utterly heartbreaking, as is his quirky behaviour leading up to a horrific incident where he is shut in a crawlspace. As audience members, we wish we could just leap into the TV and protect Cole from all the problems – and Collette does an exceptional job of the protective mother. Bruce Willis anchors the film adequately, but this film is all about Osment.<br/><br/>There are times where the film gets a bit schmaltzy, such as a ""happily ever after"" scene where Osment is now popular, the lead in the school play and the bully is relegated to ""village idiot."" I also found a scene where Cole screams ""stuttering Stanley"" at his teacher to be a relatively silly way to end what was a powerful scene. The final sequence with Willis and his realisation, whilst powerful in the twist department, felt a little too like Ghost to be effective. However, I cannot give The Sixth Sense less than an excellent review, because Osment's acting and Shyamalan's storytelling can earn four stars just between them."

A great supernatural thriller which never lets your attention lose while presenting this sensitively told tale of a small boy who is living in constant fear of the dead who seem to be stalking him. Although the famous twist in the tale has been the biggest point for discussion, it's amazing how well the story stands up even when you know that it's coming; you find yourself admiring the wonderful performances, particularly by Haley Joel Osment whom considering his age at that time was frankly astonishing. One of the best films of its type and an achievement for all."

"CinematicInceptions","8","0","1","1 August 2015"," Surprisingly good story and not very horror.
","If I were to sum up this movie in one word, it would be: unexpected. The twist at the end is by its very definition unexpected, though I'd read about the ending beforehand so it didn't really surprise me. However, the movie also unexpectedly well thought out, breaking from the precedent set by other horror movies, and is surprisingly un-scary. It really isn't a horror movie at all, but rather a drama with the horror elements as a bonus. It's kind of like the more intense and high-octane scenes in Interstellar, where they aren't what makes the movie great but are just kind of an added bonus. At it's core, the movie is about two people helping each other deal with a problem that no one else knows about and about redemption. I'm sure there are a lot of dead people in real life (is that a paradox?) who wish they had another shot to make things right.<br/><br/>The story moves at a nice pace and presents the exposition and state of affairs at the beginning of the movie well. Everything that needs to be addressed is addressed, but in a plausible manner without unrealistic expositional dialogue. There are subplots with Cole having to tell his mom about his gift and Malcolm dealing with his strained relationship with his wife, and they weave nicely into the main plot line of Malcolm helping Cole find a solution to his being a ghost seer or whatever you want to call it. His ability is kind of like the inverse of The Lovely Bones, where a dead person helps the living and in this film a living person helps the dead. I've heard that the ghost seeing plot basis is a very old concept in cinema (which is probably what people will start saying about retired hit-man movies in a few years). Whether or not that's true, I still felt like the story here was strong enough that I don't care how recycled it is.<br/><br/>The characters are the brightest spot of the movie. They may not be the most memorable, but they are very well written, scripted, and acted. Cole isn't very relatable given his plight, but he is easy to sympathize with and comes off as pretty convincing in his description of the ghosts that he encounters. He's realistically scripted. Not too cute like a clueless little kid, but not way too intelligent like kids are in a lot of kids movies. Malcolm clearly takes pride in his work and cares about his his patients, which makes him a likable protagonist. Besides that, he clearly wants to retain a positive relationship with his wife Anna, who doesn't have much screen time but is kind of important. Cole's mom does her best to raise him alone, but seems to be under a lot of stress the whole movie, though we never quite learn why. Anna is a fairly static character, but has a lot of personality and provides a bit of an Achilles heel for Malcolm.<br/><br/>It's impressive it's execution, but not mind-blowing. There aren't any great special effects, but the directing, lighting, and shooting are great. The script and acting, again, are top notch in a very subtle and simple way.<br/><br/>For perspective viewers, I'll just say that you're in for a good story, quality execution, and some good characters, but nothing scary, and nothing flashy. Watch it in one sitting if you can and make sure you're in a distraction free environment because there is a lot of quiet dialogue. There's a little gore, but nothing too disturbing unless you typically get skittish over blood. I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone and hope that they keep in mind that the Sixth Sense is not a horror movie. Overall Rating: 8.4/10."

This is one my all time favorite movies, and definitely my favorite ghost movies.<br/><br/>One of my favorite aspects about this movie is the unsettling atmosphere it creates with some of these scenarios. A lot of scenes that could be boring are the exact opposite because of how much tension there is in almost every scene. It isn't really all that scary but the scenes that are scary, are more effective because of the tension produced.<br/><br/>Another thing that was amazing about this movie, that was absent in Shyamalan's other movies, were the performances. The most notable performance of the movie being from Haley Joel Osment, who gives probably one of the best child performances ever. Child actors aren't really known for being very good, but this was an absolutely amazing performance. Bruce Willis is also very good in this as well, playing the child psychiatrist who tries to help the boy. But Haley Joel Osment is what make this movie legendary (in my opinion)<br/><br/>And the final thing about this movie that is love is that you can almost always notice something different every time you watch it. It almost always a different experience when watch it again.<br/><br/>So to end this off, I think The Sixth Sense is absolutely perfect suspense mystery and I feel it gets better every time I watch it."

","""I see dead people. Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead.""<br/><br/>When asked what my favorite films are, M. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller The Sixth Sense tops the list for me every time. I know he hasn't been on a role lately, but that doesn't stop me from having high expectations for any of his upcoming projects because I was deeply influenced by this film. Even his following movies, Unbreakable and Signs, rank among my favorites, and I went as far as defending his work in The Happening (which is a guilty pleasure of mine). His latest films have disappointed me, but I still admire his storytelling and the way he builds suspense in his films (he's heavily influenced by another favorite director of mine: Alfred Hitchcock). I'm looking forward to the release of his new TV series, Wayward Pines, which seems like a return to form for this talented director. But I'm even more excited about his upcoming film, The Visit, which will be released in September. <br/><br/>I was 18 when this film came out and I had just passed my final High School exam so I decided to treat myself to the movies that night to celebrate. Up to this point I was simply a casual viewer of movies and enjoyed pretty much everything I saw. I had no idea about film criticism, and when I got to the theater I decided on The Sixth Sense simply because it starred Bruce Willis. I didn't know anything else about the film and was surprised it wasn't another action vehicle from Willis. The film had a very slow and creepy opening, but I was sucked in by the story and the building atmosphere. I was enjoying the strong chemistry between Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the pair were trying to figure out what was causing these freaky visions. There were several surprisingly scary scenes that made me jump out of my seat a couple of times. The score was deeply effective as well. I was hooked from the very opening scene, but I was not at all prepared for the surprising and revealing twist at the end that left me completely blown away and speechless in the theater as the credits began rolling. I was in love with The Sixth Sense and from that moment on I have not stopped praising it. <br/><br/>I can't believe all the signs that Shyamalan leaves behind for the audience while he is telling the story, and we still couldn't see the twist coming. He practically has Osment spell it out in his famous scene with Willis. It was a movie I had to rewatch simply because of that twist, and the second viewing allowed me to appreciate the film even more by catching up on all the symbolisms and clues that the director left behind. In my opinion it is the best twist ever because you never feel cheated by it. I credit this movie for getting me interested in film as an art form, although the transition didn't happen from one moment to the next. The performances from Willis, Olivia Williams, and Toni Collette are all great, but Osment stood out, and it remains one of the best child performances I've seen from a Hollywood film."

I thought he looked good in Die Hard, but man never has he been good in this movie when playing a three-dimensional character in a humane horror film. Haley Joel Osment is great. I really like him in this role, even in other roles when he is child. <br/><br/>The story of this movie amazes me to see how M.Night can write and direct a good film with the proper techniques. <br/><br/>But overall I adored this film. I would recommend this to every person who wants to make good movie or maybe even a horror film."

","The older and more experienced I get in life, the more I seem to appreciate The Sixth Sense. M. Night Shyamalan took his time writing and directing this tremendous work of film. I find it cornball when people proclaim movies as art that are all about themes and expressionism, but I'm starting to understand that feeling after my most recent Sixth Sense view. Every time I watch the movie there seems to be something new I pick up that I didn't previously notice. The story is so solid, there isn't one crack in it. To go along with such a fresh screenplay was an amazing cast that headlined Bruce Willis, which I don't think it's crazy to say that this is his best work. The Sixth Sense is more of a drama than a horror film but when the ghost scenes occurred they were terrifying and unforgiving to the viewer. On a lighter note too, it was nice to see the family dog make it through a scary flick for once. Definitely check out The Sixth Sense (9/10) because it is still worthy of a watch even if you know the twist."
"hounddogemilee","9","0","1","4 May 2015"," This film is clever in more ways than one
","The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that each time you watch it, you can pick up something new. M. Night Shyamalan and his crew created a world and characters that were easy to believe in as well as engage in. There may have been one or two scenes that were necessary, but the movie never felt like it was dragging on. It also doesn't rely on just scaring the viewer, but draws out all sorts of emotions.<br/><br/>The biggest thing about this film is its cleverness. Everyone mentions the twist at the end, but I argue that this film was good without it. The film is complex enough to keep interest. Yes, the twist is what this movie if really known for, but I think that it sometimes over-shadows the story of a young boy who sees dead people. All of the parts of the film work really well together and I never felt there was something that was out of place.<br/><br/>The cinematography is not ground breaking, but it creates lots of contrast that definitely adds to the story. I thought the music was a great fit as it was not too overpowering at emotional moments, but was able to create suspense when needed. Haley Joel Osment's acting is fantastic. He looked as professional as the great adult actors. Although Bruce Willis acts this part very well, I may have gone with a different actor because of his reputation as hard edged characters. <br/><br/>As I said before, it is as rewarding if not more rewarding to watch it more than once. It has many little ins and outs that make this film more complex than most. Overall, this film is very entertaining to watch and I think has more to say than what is on the surface."

","Dr Malcolm Crowe is a happily married, successful child psychologist, of course he isn't entirely successful and one of those children he couldn't help changes his life for ever when he breaks into Dr Crowe's house and shoots him before committing suicide. Some time later Dr Crowe has another young patient; a troubled boy named Cole; a boy with a secret. Cole reminds Crowe of the patient he failed; this time he is determined to succeed. At first he doesn't know what is troubling Cole; he suspects abuse but he has a loving mother and there are no other obvious suspects and there is definitely something strange about the boy; he knows things he should not know mostly things involving people who died in unpleasant circumstances. That is Cole's secret; he sees dead people! Will Dr Crowe or anybody else be able to help him cope with his situation?<br/><br/>I doubt many people have managed to avoid this films main twist however just in case somebody has I won't spoil it here. The story is well told with details being drip fed to the viewer rather than everything being explained at once; indeed the 'I see dead people' revelation doesn't come until the film has almost reached the half way point. Bruce Willis is on top form as Dr Crowe but it is young Haley Joel Osment who dominates the film as Cole; a character who is gentle, somewhat troubled and at times more than a little creepy. The support cast, which includes Toni Collette as Cole's mother and Olivia Williams, who plays Dr Crowe's wife put in solid performances in their smaller roles. While this isn't a horror film there are some chilling moments but none too disturbing. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan did a great job in what is probably still his best film it is certainly the best of the ones I've seen. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; even if you've seen it before or know the twist it is worth watching as there new things to be spotted when you know certain facts."

","This is my recollection of seeing this movie, and I saw it twice.<br/><br/>My girlfriend had decided to study in Spain for Spring Semester 2000, and I didn't like that at all! We decided, however, to go see The Sixth Sense in January, shortly before her leave. It fascinated me by its fresh approach to horror, quite different from the stuff I'd seen before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the strain of not being together for half a year, save for my visiting her for a month, resulted in breaking up.<br/><br/>In July I decided to try various devices in order to cure my heart, and one of them was going to the pictures alone to see The Sixth Sense again that was still running. I thought I'd be scared happy, or something...<br/><br/>To my chagrin, the scary scenes didn't scare me at all, as I could anticipate them. On the other hand, I realized that underneath the horror layer was a layer of sadness, of loosing someone dear to you etc. (Remember the scene where Willis tries to grasp the check, and his wife snaps it up and says: ""Happy Anniversary!"") This, and all the typical couples in love who surrounded me in the dark of the theater, forced me to make a holy wow never to go to cinema once more without female company!"
"datorsiers2","8","0","2","2 December 2014"," A powerful movie.
","The last ten minutes really made this movie make sense, before the movie was over, i already jumped to conclusions and thought - oh, this movie seems completely illogical, since nobody ever speaks to Malcolm, Cole's mom didn't even hire him nor there were any conversations between them. Also he never had a conversation with his wife where she really spoke to him. An unusual movie for Bruce Willis, because he was in this movie i was unsure whether i wanted to see this or not, luckily i did and his performance didn't disappoint me, in my opinion, definitely one of his greatest movies. Also for a Kid actor Haley Joel Osment's acting was superb, he was incredibly mature throughout the movie, despite him being so young. It is not really made clear whether Cole knew Malcolm was dead or not, Malcolm was the only ghost Cole wasn't scared of and the only one who could help him. Through helping Cole, Malcolm found his path and accepted his death."

"nicolechan916","9","0","1","9 November 2014"," Brilliantly made and acted with a thriller element.
","I watched this before when I was younger and could still remember some of the scenes that had ingrained itself in my brain. My memory of this film was that it was horrifying, but after watching it again, it wasn't as scary as I'd remembered. But M. Night Shyamalan definitely did a good job in keeping the thriller feel of the movie throughout.<br/><br/>This film is just so brilliantly made and considering that it was made before the turn of the century, the visual effects were pretty good too. Every scene is so carefully executed with utmost precision that I had actually forgotten the crucial element of the story when I was watching this.<br/><br/>The acting is also magnificent. I had just watched Pulp Fiction prior to watching this (and I'm sorry but I do not get what Pulp Fiction is about and probably won't even review it) that I was somewhat taken aback at the change in Willis' character. Willis really got into his character here and you can really see the drastic difference between the characters he usually plays. Haley Joel Osment, is just my favourite child actor ever. The other movie he was in; Pay It Forward, is another favourite of mine and I don't know how the learned to act when he was so young but his face just makes the audience empathize with him. Toni Collette who plays Cole's mother is also a vivid character in this. She plays the conflict of loving her child and at the same time being frightened of him, perfectly. Her expressions were very readable.<br/><br/>The music in thisI don't think I noticed all that much. But what made this film all the more scary and which horror films have become experts at, are the sound effects. Whenever something is about to happen, the sound build-up matches the rising tension and then the brief sound explosions further enforces the impact when something appears. I think I probably got more frightened by the sound effects than the visual input itself.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a masterpiece, however the ending was a bit abrupt for me. I did not fully understand what the closure was.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championagels.wordpress.com"

","Bruce Willis is Dr Malcolm Crowe, a decorated psychologist and happily married man living and practicing in Philadelphia. Suddenly one night an armed intruder enters his house and shoots him in front of his wife. Crowe appears to be badly injured but lucid enough to realize that the shooter (a young adult man) used to be his patient years ago when he was a child.<br/><br/>The scene terminates and we see again Crowe a few months (or a year) later providing counseling to an 8 year-old boy (Cole Sear) who lives with his mother. The movie is centered on the interaction between the psychologist and the child. Crowe also is shown to speak to his wife throughout the film but she appears oddly aloof, something that suggests marital problems or at least some detachment of the couple.<br/><br/>Anyway, Crowe tries to help the troubled kid, and to understand the cause of his problems and heal them. Curiously most of their meetings do not take place at the doctor's office; it is obvious that Crowe makes larger than usual effort to help the youngster and visits him also at home and at school. Soon we start to wonder about the source of the kid's anxiety and fears and how these are related to Willis' character. The movie answers these questions.<br/><br/>My rating is 9/10 for this movie. One among the 2-3 better movies by Night Shyamalan. But not the best. In fact the 'Sixth Sense' reminded me of another Shyamalan movie 'The Unbreakable' which I think is the best movie that Shyamalan ever directed. Bruce Willis has again the central role. The 'Unbreakable' and the 'Sixth Sense' have some things in common. First, the place is the same. Both movies take place in Philadelphia, which is a Greek name (of the old Byzantine city of Asia Minor) and literally means the City of Brotherly Love. I believe that Willis character (in both movies) tries to do just that: to help his fellow human being inside the community. Secondly, the theme in both movies has similarities: in both movies the central hero is haunted by some event from his past. This event drives his actions and in both movies it is revealed to us at the end."

","The director of this film is a mastermind! Leaving us with small hidden details and using symbolism to reveal certain information throughout the story, only later to find out the very well constructed plot. Completely unique and very original in it's creation. There has been yet another movie as skillfully planned out. Bruce Willis playing the role of Malcolm and Haley Osment playing the role of Cole, the character choices couldn't have been more appropriate. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie which left me hanging at the edge of my seat the entire time. I loved how this story circled around from beginning to end. Simply revealing little details and information one at a time and if you were lucky, you were able to catch on to the idea of Malcolm's true interactions with Cole and the reasoning behind them."

The film is good the ending really was the best bit it just made me really cry what he says to his girl and when he realises it and accepts it just very cute. Also the film was abit scary many parts in it did manage to give me the chills and made me look behind my shoulder a couple of times it is very intelligent in the fact that I'm sure many people along with myself also didn't click onto the ending. I'm glad I watched this film it has been out for a while and I felt I was missing out when I heard people saying 'I see dead people'. That quote is clearly associated with the film and I wanted to know what it meant so I watched it. Definitely worth a watch."

Before I watch this, I think it is horror movie, but it is sad and little oppressive. Dr. Malcolm doesn't death himself, but Cole knows everything.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","0","1","5 September 2014"," Doesn't feel like the genre its in, yet works either way,...mostly
","After Die Hard (1988) had permanently made actor Bruce Willis a go to action star, he could couldn't get himself out of it. He did manage to snag a few roles that were out of the action genre but none of them really stuck. At least, not until he decided to take part in this little project. There's also something to say about this films director, M. Night Shyamalan. It may not be his first directorial or writing job, but he certainly shows the kind of potential he had from the beginning. Of course, for many viewers now a days he's missing his mark to the point of no return. However, that is a discussion for another time. Ghost stories are not a new thing; they've been told several different ways. However, something about this particular story does make it quite different from the rest.<br/><br/>Psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), is given a case where a child, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is considered an outcast among his single mother and classmates for being strange for his own reasons. Along with this is Crowe's own subplot dealing with him trying to reconnect with his distant wife. Among the rest of the cast are other good actors which all pitch solid performances. Not one actor here gives a performance that isn't believable. In fact, for a horror film, it had several significant emotional moments along the way that helped define the its characters and gave them depth. Of these actors, Bruce Willis gave his most realistic showing that is not seen all too often. Frequently, Willis is playing sharp, hot-headed, wise-cracking characters. Here, he's the exact opposite - cautious, soft spoken and well-mannered. It's a nice change in character.<br/><br/>And of course with this inventive writing comes the respective errors. One big error is the continuity. The laws of how ghosts work are not kept clear to what their limitations are. An example of this would be how ghosts can touch certain physical objects and not others. Certain rules like these are difficult to follow, especially when it comes to certain plot points. When it came to the horror elements of this movie, it was effective in some areas, while others not so much. What did look well done were the practical effects. This helped create some disturbing images. Unfortunately, what didn't assist in making these images even creepier was the lighting and camera work. Tak Fujimoto, the cinematographer for Silence of the Lambs (1991) also worked for this project and his selection of lighting doesn't assist any of the jump scare moments in any fashion. If the whole scare shot is in total bright light from beginning to end, how is that going to be scary?<br/><br/>Musically related, James Newton Howard's score did its job accordingly. For the horror elements there were screeching strings and sudden percussion for the scares. This is typical but also doable. For the scenes with the more creep out factor, Howard used piano frequently that only relied on a number of keys to give that uneasy tone. Piano was also used for the more emotional scenes and they were probably the most effective due to the execution and writing behind the composition. It certainly did not have a memorable theme but its overall listening experience can be done solo without watching the movie. It is a decent movie with some apparent problems, but it still entertains.<br/><br/>Continuity flaws and authentic scares are not its strong points, but its creepy imagery, music and realistic practical effects help recover that loss. Along with that is Bruce Willis' most likable human performance to date with an interesting story and other believable showings from other actors."
"OllieSuave-007","6","0","2","27 November 2013"," A very average ghost movie.
","This was a very average ghost movie about young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osmont), who sees spirits of the deceased who do not know they're dead, and seeks the help of a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) to deal with his problems.<br/><br/>There are some scary moments in this movie including the appearances of the wandering and pale-looking ghosts, and the part where Cole utters the classic line ""I see dead people"" while cold breath is coming out of his mouth.<br/><br/>However, I think the lack of emotion in the film overshadows the horror elements, making this a pretty dreary movie at times. Most of the characters lack emotion passion and appear very wooden, except for Osmont's character. And, the plot was slow-paced and the cinematography was dull. I guess this is director M. Night Shyamalan's style, as other movies I've seen of his use the same elements. But, this style isn't really appealing.<br/><br/>Again, overall, this is a very average movie.<br/><br/>Grade C"

This movie is slow paced, has bad acting, it is boring, not suspenseful, not scary, a waste of time and downright despicable. Watching this movie is like watching your laundry tumble in the dryer for two hours. That is how much I despise this film and that is how boring and slow paced it is. However I have to give kudos off to Bruce Willis for his role in this film. I thought he was the only actor who did very well in this film. If you want to see a really scary movie, I would recommend Event Horizon or The Hills Have Eyes."
"classicsoncall","8","0","1","1 April 2011"," ""I don't want to be scared anymore"".
","I have to admit, when I saw this film the first time, I never saw the twist coming. I'm thinking now I should have, like I should have been paying closer attention to the principals and their relationship to each other, but somehow they sneaked one past me. This film and ""Unbreakable"" made me a Shyamalan fan for a time, but then he went ahead and squandered it with ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"", but that's another story.<br/><br/>Movie fans tuning in expecting to see a down and out horror flick here might come away disappointed. It's got some scary stuff to be sure, but I don't think that was the point. What the director was going for here was a treatment of the life after death theme, and the concept of lost souls hanging around until their mission in life has been accomplished. Watching the picture a second time, the clues become obvious, as when Dr. Crowe (Bruce Willis) responds to young Cole's (Haley Joel Osmont) question whether he was a good doctor - ""Well, I used to be"". 'Used' to be! Willis' character telegraphs the punch line for the viewer without making it overtly obvious, and that's the brilliance of the film.<br/><br/>I think this kid Osmont has a wonderful career ahead of him if he doesn't get sucked into the Britney Spears/Lindsay Lohan school of dysfunctional celebrity. Though he looked younger here than his actual age (11), I thought he did a superb job, especially during the heart wrenching admission when he confesses his ability to see 'dead people'. It was at that point that believers in the hereafter got on board with the theme of the film, that there's a life after death and that there are things that can't be rationally explained once a spirit passes on. Dr. Crowe realizes that it's time for him to move on once he's helped Cole get beyond his grief over a father that's abandoned him. In Cole Sear's case, it meant dealing with the visions of spirits who departed in conflicted circumstances instead of peacefully passing on."
"ElMaruecan82","10","0","1","13 February 2011"," A Milestone for Psychological Thrillers and a Masterpiece of Suspense and Drama ...
","The amazing climax of the 90's have enriched our cinematic knowledge with extraordinary movies, from the immersion into a parallel universe named ""The Matrix"" and the unforgettable heart-breaking ""Green Mile"", to the powerful social commentary of the pre-millennium consumerist society in ""American Beauty"" and ""Fight Club"", not to mention the resuscitation of the legendary ""Star Wars"" saga  and still, only one movie managed to get so rapidly and deeply rooted in Pop-Culture: M. Night Shamalayan's ""The Sixth Sense"", one of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years.<br/><br/>What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that ""The Sixth Sense"" didn't use breakthrough visual effects contrarily to its contemporary films. It had quite a minimal cast, and a very sober directing, yet it managed to create a particular atmosphere that seemed to belong only to this new classic. I don't think any other horror film reached such a level of originality since the 1970's. Indeed ""The Sixth Sense"" creates the reminiscent feeling of Friedkin's ""Exorcist"" and seems to remind us how horror is one of the most likely movie genre to create unforgettable films, when handled correctly. I mention the 70's as the decade that preceded the slasher era which made gore so ordinary and laughable it killed all the purpose of a horror film, which is all about a psychological dosage of expectations and thrills. And this dosage works in ""The Sixth Sense"" : there's a whole feeling that something is going to happen, yet it takes its time, time for us to get into those characters, to discover Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) the no-emotion child psychologist, and Cole Sear, the enigmatic kid who inherited a strange power, a sixth sense that looks more like a doom than a gift. The movie is renowned for a revelation featured in one of the most iconic quotes of the last 20 years, thus revealing this power is not necessarily ruining the premise of the film, but anyway, I will focus on the cinematic achievement aspect responsible of the extraordinary rebirth of the horror classic genre. And again, I think the comparison with ""The Exorcist"" is relevant since the movie approaches the genre with a long build-up in an ordinary family house setting, which gives enough time to approach the characters and their background, so we can identify with them. And step by step, the supernatural elements are patiently introduced, with an efficient timeliness, leading us to an unforgettable climax.<br/><br/>The supernatural elements are perfectly handled thanks to the amazing Oscar-worthy performances of Haley Joel Osment, as Cole Sear, the kid who's not a kind of know-it-all smart kid or a whining victim, but an innocent doomed little boy, Toni Collette as Lynn, the supportive mother who suffers from the torments of despair and powerlessness to help her little boy and her struggle to bring back some ounce of normality in Coles 'life is particularly heartbreaking. The mother and son relationship is the heart of the film when the dorsal spine is Dr. Malcolm Crowe's back-story with Bruce Willis in one of his most underrated out-of-character performances as a mysterious doctor who tries to help and assist Cole in this painful experience, which seems to be a two-ways therapy inhabited by a profound will of redemption. Carrying the whole narrative structure of the film, Willis' job looks like a psychological investigation, that gives a movie a sort of noir feeling and the film is an intricate puzzle that respects the audience's intelligence by letting enough hints to guide us to the climax but not obvious enough to decrease the sensational aspect of the ending. The last minutes, the last ten minutes of the film are so emotionally rewarding that you can't help but feel like watching it a second time. It's one of the few films where the experience of the first viewing is so harrowing you can't perceive yet the intelligence and cleverness of the script, only after a second viewing.<br/><br/>The script is certainly the strongest element of the film, too often overlooked in other horror movies, here it works because of the realism of the dialogs and the directing that makes the story scarily believable. The film would never have been so memorable if it only relied on special effects and cinematography: the viewer can be fooled by what he sees, but fooling him with words, with verbal interactions, with actions, looks and silences is a challenge that have been successfully achieved by talented directors like the master Hitchcock (""Psycho"" being the most obvious example) but the director was not Hitchcock, M. Night Shamalayan was a young débutant who would never have been thought to make a movie so iconic and so rapidly. Yet, if it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, it definitely was the movie that impacted the viewers the most. No wonder ""The Sixth Sense"" made it in AFI's Top 100, as a recognition of the significance of the film and the revolutionary aspect it had on cinematic storytelling by paving the way for movies with long build-up and spectacular conclusions, an impact, even the director could not match it with his later films.<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" is a heart-pounding thriller like any other one has been made before. But don't expect countless deaths or disturbing gore, instead you'll have an extraordinary atmosphere, amazing performances and an intelligent script. Expect another viewing, expect some scary moments and some deeply emotional ones, and if you don't say a big ""Wow"" at the end, either this film has been spoiled for you, either you're one of the most exceptionally intelligent people that doesn't get fooled by little cinematic hints. In both case, it's unfortunate without prevent you though from enjoyment, because ""The Sixth Sense"" still works on the emotional level, thanks to the amazing performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette."

"mnpollio","6","0","1","9 August 2010"," Solid if underwhelming work
","The Sixth Sense is a solid supernatural melodrama, whose reputation as something far better may leave new viewers underwhelmed and pondering its accolades. Known as the film that made M. Night Shyamalan a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood (a reason to be annoyed with it right there), the film is well written but follows a relatively unsurprising path up until its ""shocking"" twist climax which apparently had rather dull-witted viewers who had never before seen a film inventing superlatives to describe it. The story focuses on a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) with the ability to ""see dead people"" as the film's notorious tagline informs us and the relationship that develops between his stoic psychologist Bruce Willis and himself. There are a number of things to like about the film. It is atmospheric, solidly constructed and features a truly amazing central turn by young Osment, who is both believable and sympathetic as the beleaguered young boy. Toni Collette is also memorable as the boy's concerned mother. There are a few jolts here and there, but the film somehow never manages to be truly terrifying - largely because sharp-eyed viewers will intuit early on that the specters mean the boy no harm. On the downside, the film would be benefited from a better leading man. Even fans of Willis must admit that his cinema acting can be divided into two classes: smarmy or lifeless. The more serious the drama, the more lifeless Willis becomes. His chemistry with Osment is often as chilly as the temperature drop that precedes a ghost. In fact, the very tenor of his performance helps give away the much heralded surprise climax. One cannot discuss this film without touching on the climax - which is really the aspect that pushed this film over-the-top, but it is hard to explain why since many viewers will figure it out within the first 20 minutes and will not be the least blown away by the final revelation. The fact that the revelation really has no bearing on the plot itself or the personal outcome of the young boy's future is bad enough, but even worse is the fact that Willis' detached demeanor robs it of much in the way of emotional punch either. A good, but not a great film from a director known more now for his missteps than his classics."

","I didn't have any preconceptions about this film when I watched it for the first time because I wasn't aware of anything about it at all which is remarkable in itself considering I watched it about seven years after it was released. I liked this film because it was innovative and not really that shocking but it worked for me on all sorts of levels because it was clear to me that a lot of care was taken in its production. All of those involved deserve congratulations on a job well done. The storyline was relatively easy to follow but like a lot of other people I wandered willingly up the wrong path and was pleasantly surprised by the revelation when it came. The film is about as good as the parts that make it up which means that I would give this film 9.5 out of ten but since I cannot do this I will give it a 9. When I watched it for the second time I took particular note of all of the interactions and it was then that I saw how good the film is. The central characters are strong apart from Bruce Willis who in my humble opinion didn't quite step up to the mark. I do not know enough about acting but I do know that there was something about Willis which didn't quite set well within the film. It wasn't a major flaw but the 'feel' was not always spot on. Maybe I am being overcritical here but it was my feeling. That aside it is a remarkable piece of work and I would recommend anyone watch it and fortunately it is good enough to be watched repeatedly"
"vip_ebriega","10","0","2","22 January 2010"," One of the most poignantly-told ghost stories of all time.
","My Take: Nuanced and subtly creepy, and oftentimes heartbreaking and sad. A perfect showcase of M. Night Shymalan's unique storytelling talents.<br/><br/>Haters call M. Night Shymalan the ""one-hit wonder"" so aggressively that they seem to forget just how effective that ""one-hit"" was. His first real big hit (but not his first film), THE SIXTH SENSE is a perfect introduction to the unique and rarely seen (in Hollywood)) storytelling talents of M. Night Shymalan, something that wasn't appreciated for too long. But I doubt anyone will disagree that THE SIXTH SENSE is a triumph of storytelling; a ghost story told in a most original and subtle way and achieves to sustain our interest without much use of heavy effects. But it's actually more than just another well-crafted ghost story, It's also actually an interesting drama grounded in semi-supernatural elements. <br/><br/>Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a gifted psychologist; his friends and his wife (Olivia Williams) thinks his talents is a gift, but he on the other hand considers it a curse due to a failure to cure a kid in the past that since has haunted him. Meanwhile, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, a career-making performance) is a quiet, problematic boy. He gets picked on by his bully classmates and his mom (Toni Collette) isn't exactly comfortable when he isn't telling her what's wrong. And you thought seeing dead people was tough! The film says ghost see only what they want to see. So that doesn't make them any less different from the living. Here, Cole sees his ability to see and communicate with folks from the other side as a curse; something he wished he never had. But when he discovers how to wrest control of it, he starts to see what it really is: A gift in disguise. This plays a very strong part with the film's still shocking ending (a gimmick Shymalan would use in his later films), but actually plays (among with other issues) throughout the films. THE SIXTH SENSE is more than just a well-crafted genre picture; Shymalan uses it as means to tell a story dealing with some personal issues.<br/><br/>Most will remember THE SIXTH SENSE as for its shocker of an ending, a great example of a true and shocking payoff that provides the perfect closure to a perfect film. But the pleasures of THE SIXTH SENSE doesn't begin and end there. The relevant issues tackled throughout the film (more prominently, family issues like divorce, mid-life crises and rejection) is unnerving just as some of the film's ""jump-from-your-seat"" moments are subtly creepy. But among the things that truly grabbed me about THE SIXTH SENSE is it's true emotions. Haters can call Shyamalan whatever they want, but he knows a thing or two about emotions. The scene where Cole talks to his mom about how he gets frequent ""visits"" from grandma starts out creepy, but really is sad and heartfelt, and Shymalan doesn't make use of any faux emotions whatsoever; just the simplicity of the staging of the scene. Then there's the ending (which I will not reveal for the sake of the small number of people who have not seen it or don't remember it), which was intended to shock the audience. But come to look at it, I realized just how sad and heartbreaking it really is.<br/><br/>The setup for his later films would be similar to THE SIXTH SENSE, from the nuanced slow-burn setup paid off by a shocker ending. But like THE SIXTH SENSE, Shymalan's later films have an interesting story told in a most unique way not seen in most typical Hollywood movies. There's always something to look forward to in his films. Ever since his success with THE SIXTH SENSE, we are introduced to an unqualified talented storyteller; often hated but nevertheless one of the most underrated minds in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","This film is about a child psychiatrist helping a distressed young boy who sees dead people.<br/><br/>""The Sixth Sense"" has always been regarded as an extraordinary film by many. I have to say I enjoyed watching it, but I find it rather overrated. The thing that strikes me the most is Toni Collette's great acting as a troubled mother. She portrays her stress and distress well. For the plot itself, maybe it's because I already knew the ending when I watched it, I did pick up on the clues related to the ending twist. ""The Sixth Sense"" is enjoyable and engaging, but I did not find it as groundbreaking as other people think."
"rowsdower45","5","0","1","10 September 2008"," In other words, an M. Night Shyamalan film.
","I was preparing to sing the praises of this film like I hadn't done for any film in such a long time. The first 95 minutes formed one of the most hauntingly beautiful (or beautifully haunting?) horror stories I've ever seen. Osment's performance completely blew me away, and Willis didn't stop short of earning his paycheck either. Willis' performance as a troubled psychiatrist struggling to understand and help save this fear-wracked boy was a pleasant reminder of the man's true, unsung versatility.<br/><br/>And then the ending happened, and forgive me for somewhat glossing over the film's good points, but just thinking about how thoroughly wasted all this greatness was just has the effect of getting me angry all over again.<br/><br/>First, I should make it clear that, having heard the ""I see dead people"" line, I knew mostly what the film was about (though perhaps this would only have delayed how obvious the ""twist"" became). So from the end of the first scene onward, I was simply proceeding, as I assumed I was meant to, with the knowledge that Dr. Crowe was dead. I kept waiting for the emotional ""reveal"" scene that would provide the impetus for the film's final act, but I never imagined that that scene would be the *ending*. I thought we would find out that (for instance) Crowe survived the shooting at the beginning, only to somehow have Cole (or Cole's absent father) cause his death later. I also want to know more about Cole. Does he ever stop seeing the ghosts? Does he grow up and get his own TV show? Does he eventually snap anyway and go on Vincent's homicidal rampage?<br/><br/>But no. Shyamalan was too busy being flashy and trying to get talked about to wrap up his beautiful story in any meaningful way. Is this what we have become as a society? Are movies really getting this dumbed down, so that we're at a point where we won't trust anything a director doesn't smash over our head? Fine, fine, I'll get back in my seat; this was nine years ago, after all. Nobody knew that M. Night was an arrogant hack. Now that we do, I think it's high time we got over this film, and just allow M. Night's career to begin its inevitable petering out.<br/><br/>For a film to be bad is one thing. This film is not that. For a film to make you feel angry and used, to the point that you wonder why you even bother watching movies anymore, is quite another. Then again, I suppose that's what I get for taking an M. Night Syamalan film seriously."

","I have to confess I didn't figure the plot out in the first 10 minutes.But that's because I was so BORED I didn't waste neurons trying to figure it out. <br/><br/>This film has no alternative to being boring because the screenplay has to carefully keep Bruce Willis from engaging in conversation with any other adult for nearly two screen hours! This give it an oddly staid funeral parlor cache between the gripping beginning and end sequences. <br/><br/>That said, it is artistically done, well-edited, and well-acted, despite being so drawn out.<br/><br/>I agree with other reviewers that it would have been perfect for a 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, or longer treatment at the hand of Alfred Hitchcock."

We couldn't go to sleep for that night, and sometimes I will still have nightmares.<br/><br/>Anyways, it was a good movie. It kept you on the edge of your seat and was pretty interesting too. I liked it. The story is about a man, Dr. Malcome Crowe, who wants to take control of his life. His wife isn't talking to him anymore (even though they live together) and he isn't doing to great with his job anymore (he's a child therapist.) Until one day he meets Cole, a little boy who has a huge problem: he sees dead people.

"Torgo_Approves","8","0","1","27 October 2006"," The ""Usual Supects"" syndrome strikes back!
","(r#92)<br/><br/>I will start out by saying that at no point did I not enjoy this ghost story from M. Night Shyalaman, who gets everything right in ""Sense"" that he got wrong in ""Village"". It is a very solid thriller, very original in terms of plot, slow-paced but never boring, and it has at least one scene which really freaked me out. The acting is brilliant, Bruce Willis is Bruce as usual, his raspy voice perfect for his troubled character, even though some will find it hard to buy John McClane as a child psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment continues to prove why he's one of the best child actors working today, putting wide-eyed Dakota Fanning and that mugging kid from ""The Omen 666"" (or whatever it's called) to shame. His performance is great, neither over-the-top nor underacted, and unlike most of his kind, he's not annoying, thank god. Toni Colette is also very good as the depressed mother, although she was even better in ""About a Boy"" as a deranged hippie. So overall, an intriguing and often tense film and probably one of the best of a very strong movie year.<br/><br/>But is it really that good? Is it one of the 250 best movies ever made? I enjoyed it so much I'm willing to agree. Although, if you-know-who wasn't you-know-what, there is no way that this flick would be in the top 150. It seems that according to IMDb's questionable rating system, every movie with an ending you can't see coming deserves a 10. Case in point: This movie in the top 250, The Usual Suspects, of all movies, in the top 20, the trashy exploitation flick Saw with a score of 7.6, already being hailed as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Is a twist ending all the average movie buff craves? Well, 'Manos' the Hands of Fate has a twist ending, I don't see that one on the top 250. Think before you vote, people. Not every movie that goes out with a bang is brilliant. For anyone who has been unlucky enough to discover who *thatdude* really is, The Sixth Sense will be a disappointment. For me, it definitely was. But it's such an enjoyable disappointment I'm willing to give this an 8/10.<br/><br/>PS. What the hell happened, Schyalaman? You went from memorability to mediocrity so fast. You could've really been one of the all time greats, but you screwed it up. Well, at least you provided David Zucker with material with your borefest ""The Village""."

Night Shyamalan has made much better movies than this, and I think the ghost scenes were all a little too exaggerated.<br/><br/>This movie would have worked a lot better if it was a psychological thriller, not with supernatural events, like it could have turned out that Cole's condition might have had something to do with his mind, like he thinks that he is seeing dead people, or something like that, something similar to what Gothika is based on.<br/><br/>This movie is OK to watch, and can get a little scary in places, but I still think it could have been a lot better without all these supernatural events actually being for real, it would have helped me to enjoy it a lot more, and the ending could have been a much better one, for example Malcolm helps Cole but realises that he's not actually dead and then gets reconciled with his wife or something. (I know this sounds confusing, but bear with me because I'm not a very good critic!).

"patrick_dunne","8","0","1","26 January 2006"," The Sixth Sense isn't just scary: It's an un-predictable and smart drama that will surprise you
","Famous horror-movie director, M. Night Shylaman made his career (Or made his name known amongst fans) with ""The Sixth Sense."" Child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe has just received an award, praising his abilities and skills in the psychological department. However, the joy is soon halted when a naked man (Well, he does have underwear.) breaks into the Crowe residence. This man claims to be a former patient of Malcolm's, and knows the roots of primitive human fear. This scene is very touching- or, shall I say: powerful? The reason for the power in this scene is because it makes us connect with the insane person inside all of us; the person who feels ashamed or angry; the guy in this scene (Vincent) is the crazy person within us.<br/><br/>After that scene, Dr. Crowe feels ashamed and guilty about what he brought onto the patient. So, he tries to redeem himself when another patient visits him: a young boy named Cole.<br/><br/>At this point, the film seems to be more or less dramatic and thrilling than the beginning. We learn about Cole, who doesn't seem to be the most normal child around. He's bullied by kids at school. He has scratches all over him. His mom doesn't trust him. Plus, he has one big secret and one very famous line: ""I see dead people."" We learn about Cole, and start to wonder about him before we sympathize for him. When his relationship with Dr. Crowe becomes tight, the film begins to become more and more dramatic and thrilling.<br/><br/>To paraphrase another IMDb user, The Sixth Sense doesn't just give us scary stuff, but it shows what fear is. It makes the characters think about fear. Just listen to Vincent's speech at the beginning.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is totally true, but I can tell you what is true: The Sixth Sense takes oh so many twists in the story. It seems un-predictable. I have frustration trying to guess the ending, because I didn't even know if Cole was seeing things or not. If he was, what was going to happen next? Of course, the biggest twist is at the end. It's probably the most famous thing in the movie. I mean, it isn't like one of those movies where they say ""He was the murderer!"" The film hides the twist, but it introduced it to us at the beginning! The film doesn't hide the possibility of it; it just doesn't expect the audience to guess it. I guess it's hard to explain without adding spoilers, so I will just say: See the film.<br/><br/>But, don't see the film purely for the ending. See it for the acting, the suspense, the story and the pure quality of the film. See it because it's a good movie.<br/><br/>I shall end with that.<br/><br/>9/10 Good: Very suspenseful and dramatic with good acting. It's also close to un-predictable for me.<br/><br/>Bad: I can't think of anything for now. It seemed kind of slow moving.<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."
"lizzardbreath","10","0","2","16 December 2005"," This movie is not a thriller
","""The #1 Thriller Of All Time""Yeah, Right!<br/><br/>(spoilers)<br/><br/>""The #1 Thriller of all time!"" is how the movie, The Sixth Sense, is advertised. But is ""thriller"" the best way to describe this story? Certainly there are many shocking, startling scenes. However, the story seems to be more of a psychological journey, colored with melancholy and sadness than most thrillers. Granted, The Sixth Sense has many scenes that employ ""scary graphics"". But these graphics look like they were designed by a seven-year-old. And does the movie fit within the thriller genre when it does not have chase scenes? The closest scene would be Malcolm walking after Cole when he had missed an appointment! Not exactly startling or thrilling.<br/><br/>Although we have had this movie for a couple of years, I had not watched it until October 29, 2005 because my little brother kept telling me how terrifying it was. I found it intriguing, but was surprised that it did not frighten me more. I even watched it again on Sunday the 30th so that I could go through and look for slip-ups on the whole ""Malcolm is a Ghost"" idea.<br/><br/>The over-riding idea within this movie of Malcolm not knowing he is a ghost carried a solid emotional punch. I found myself afraid that Malcolm's wife, Anna, was cheating on him and no longer loved him. The director, M. Night Shymalyan, did an excellent job of masking what the truth was and because of this, when it all became clear at the end, it was even more tragic. Throughout the movie Malcolm was under the impression that his wife was leaving him, but in fact he was the one to have left her! He had displayed all of the symptoms of a ghost throughout the movie, but because he had been presented as a living therapist, him being a ghost was not evident. The clues were not something that the viewer would focus on until the end of the movie when Malcolm remembers what had happened the night that he was shot. I love the scene where he realizes that it was never his wife's fault that she was not talking to him, but that she was in fact still very devoted to him. She repeatedly watched the video of their wedding, and went back to the restaurant he had proposed to her in. It is a powerful scene when Malcolm comes to understand that the loneliness that he feels is about a hundred times worse for Anna because she cannot see, hear, or smell his presence any more. She just gets cold when he is angry.<br/><br/>The graphics in this movie were simplistic and unimpressive. Scary scenes were often blurred and bloody wounds were lavishly covered in fake blood. For instance when Malcolm is shot, the camera zooms in on a clean bullet hole through the his shirt and then a growing blood stain on his back - not exactly high tech. It was evident that a hole punch was used for the shirt, with an extreme close-up to make it look bigger than it actually was, and then fake blood from a pump was used to make it look like progressive bleeding. In the scene where Vincent kills himself, they simply move him out of the range of the camera! All that is heard is a gunshot and icky, squishy sounds. And then there is the makeup used for each of the ghosts to show bruises and wounds that looked fake. When the back of the young boys head was blown off it looked like strawberry jelly slathered in his hair. And when the little girl ghost was throwing up it looked like oatmeal with yellow food coloring in it. The graphics seemed absurd and predictable to me and therefore, not very scary.<br/><br/>Unlike most thrillers, this movie carries sweet over-tones. The child, Cole, who has the sixth sense, is successful at maintaining his innocence no matter how horrific the ghost scenes are. And when Cole finally tells his mother his big secret, that he sees dead people, it does not make her look at him any differently. She loves him just the same as she always has. <br/><br/>Although I believe that the genre this movie was placed in was ill suited, it is still on my small list of favorite movies. It contains messages of love and the need to understand others within the context of their lives. Because of this, I will watch it over and over."

He brings the traditional Indian concepts of human's life and death to the Western country via his movie. Then it becomes a fresh idea for the Westerners. The story is quite scary on the first part of the film. However, it also contains emotion between parent and child. It is really touching. When the BIG surprising ending comes in, all the questions in this movie have been solved, and the whole story becomes very touching (Dr. Malcolm Crowe to his wife) Overall, this story (screenplay) is such a clever one which I haven't seen for years. this movie is not only to scary people, it also makes people believe in their faith. In addition, the soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard is great. it can create the mysterious atmosphere and terror for the film. Even though Bruce Willis is not that good in acting in this movie, the way he acts is still far greater than he did before. Most people may notice the supporting role Haley Joel Osment. He seems to be a natural born actor. I love his performance in the sixth sense (including his later movie A.I.) I think one day he can get what he deserves for academy awards.

","""The Sixth Sense"" is a creepy, atmospheric puzzler about a child psychologist who is trying to help a depressed little boy come to grips with the fact that he sees ghosts. There's more than meets the eye, as everybody knows by now, and the first time you see it, if you don't know the surprise, it's an excellent movie.<br/><br/>Like I said, everybody knows the secret by now, it's like the sled in ""Citizen Kane"" or the penis in ""The Crying Game"", so it doesn't even feel necessary to warn that there's a spoiler herein. Bruce Willis is dead! Now, if you were one of the people who found this out before seeing the movie, I bet it ruined it a little for you. And this is the problem with this movie; knowing the surprise spoils it a little bit, and since the surprise is nothing more than a gimmick (albeit a well-done gimmick), I think this movie relies a little bit too much on the gimmick to be considered a great movie.<br/><br/>I didn't know the first time I saw it, by the way, and I was blown away. In 1999, it was one of the best movies of 1999. Make no mistake. It wasn't until it was released on DVD that things started to go downhill.<br/><br/>Let me explain. I said at the top that this is actually 3 different movies, and it is; it's like a chameleon.<br/><br/>1)You're seeing it for the first time, and you don't know how it comes out. Excellent. The surprise is terrific; I figured it out, but not until about 5 minutes before it was revealed anyway, and I know there are definitely people who didn't figure it out, even though they were trying to figure out something. The first time, you really appreciate the performances by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Ozment, and Toni Collette. They all do outstanding jobs, and this is the one aspect of the movie that really does hold up over time. 10/10.<br/><br/>2) You're seeing it for the second time. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you appreciate the work that went into concealing this fact, paying attention for some little slip-up and not finding it. But really, let's be honest; on the second viewing, and probably to an extent on any subsequent viewings, you're giving your full attention to the execution of the gimmick. And it's still good, there's a lot to appreciate here. 9/10.<br/><br/>3) You're seeing it for the third time, and any time after that. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you know how artistically this was hidden throughout. So what's left? Well, the fine performances, and the creepy atmospherics, and the entertaining story. So let's not penalize the movie too much at this point, but over time, the quality definitely does wear down, because to some extent, you're still constantly thinking about that gimmick. 7/10, the rating I gave above.<br/><br/>And really, there's a fourth aspect to all this; you're seeing it for the first time, and some dip**** spoiled it for you. Well, you may actually be in a pretty good position. You know Bruce Willis is dead, so on the one hand, you're not pulled in so much by the gimmick, and you can appreciate the other aspects that made this movie good; on the other hand, the surprise is lost on you. You see, it's a completely different movie if you knew the gimmick the first time, and you will never see it the same way as others did. That's a shame, but at least you weren't trying all along to ""figure it out"", and thus, the performances by Willis, Osment, and Collette may seem all the brighter. I can't comment on how viewers would have rated the movie in this position, because I wasn't one of them. But I think they would have liked it.<br/><br/>So there you have it. AT LEAST 3 different movies, and at least 3 different ratings. I do give it points for being able to change so much on repeated viewings, but I have to take away some, because the power the movie has over you is influenced so much by that gimmick. It's not that it has become a bad movie over the years, but it has lost its status as a great movie."

","M. Night Shyamalan intelligently wrote the script for this film and brilliantly directed it. He carefully made the film which causes many audiences to misinterpret the storyline before being surprised by the plot-twist ending. It is not just the shocking ending that made the film. It is the solid character study and good social commentary that makes the film a timeless cinematic gem. After repeated viewings, the surprise is long gone, but it still manage to move me.<br/><br/>Some complain that this film is not scary. I admit that the scare factor is minimal, and there is not much suspense. However, though marketed as a horror-thriller, it is not really meant to be scary. In fact, I feel that the chills are just a bonus. The key genre of this film is drama-mystery. A story which deals with the agony of a child psychologist (well played by Bruce Willis) over his marriage, a career failure, and a difficult patient which reminds him of his failure. A story of how a boy (Haley Joel Osment) having to survive emotional and physical torture, and coping with his worried single mother's (Toni Collette) suspicion over his well-being and abnormalities.<br/><br/>After my careful observation, certain scenes are not just meant to trick audiences or drop hints for the now famous ending. Each of them mean something. However, I am not going to analyze how I interpret them to avoid spoilers. I will just say that this film deserves multiple viewings. Not just to fully comprehend it, but also to appreciate the powerful performances by Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.<br/><br/>Their Oscar nominations are well-deserved. Osment portrays the emotion of Cole Sear to perfection. Not only does he bring life into his role, he also effectively controls the atmosphere of the film. It is no wonder that this film earns him international recognitions. Toni Collette, in a relatively small role, plays Lynn Sear with complexity. Her screen time is limited, but her portrayal of the character speaks a lot. The rest of the cast are also good. Bruce Willis is humorous and has great chemistry with Osment. Olivia Williams convincingly double-play her role which is very crucial to the plot twist. Greg Wood is also subtle as a father who lost his daughter.<br/><br/>All in all, an influential masterpiece which, I strongly believe, inspired the well-crafted but inferior ""The Others"", and many other pretentious films."

","i would have rated it higher accept for one part, when Bruce Willis's character 1st meets Cole, at his house. if you remember Cole is in the room and comes out and Malcolm is just sitting there with his Coles mother. how does Bruce Willis get in there without realizing hes dead? i mean it would be impossible for him to be inside that house without talking to the mother, and we all know that its not possible for him to talk to the mother. so how the heck did he get in without realizing this??? i understand its a movie but once you watch it the second time you see Cole's mom and Malcolm just sitting there starring at each other for the most part. I just find it hard to believe that Malcolm could get in there without knowing hes dead."

M. Night Shyamalan is so special and focusing on every little piece and you are supposed to connect it step by step throughout the movie to find the director's destination.Don't get confused,when you grab the thought of the little boy Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment),you are getting closer to the core of the movie.Additonally,the twist end is classic and be the moment you will find why this movie has been rolled into the Top 250,it's generally accepted by most our audience friends.<br/><br/>The doctor(Willis) eventually waked up and knows where he belongs to and it's also time for leaving resulting from the inter-belief of Cole,who is always haunted by the ghost in his world.Cole is the only hope for these ghosts to appease themselves, M. Night Shyamalan reveals the two aspect of human character simultaneously,the ugliness and the beauty with the help of the successful figure of Cole.The clues in the movie are invaluable,with which you may totally understand the whole subject of this movie,the mind of M.

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""The Sixth Sense"" is the work of perfecting deception and scenarios, of mastering the art of keeping the audience at the edge of their seat for one chilling sequence and surprise after another, and it is by and large the work of an extremely talented, conscientious, and ambitious filmmaker- M. Night Shaymalan. The premise of this ingenious thriller involves the relationship of a disparaged child psychologist (Willis) and a curious, coy, prodigal young boy who is uniquely troubled, he ""sees dead people"", and is lost as to how to embrace the spirits he encounters. Yet, being the master of deception that Shaymalan synonymously is, one cannot merely accept this as a single premise, for there is much, much more beneath the surface of this curious relationship. In viewing a film such as this and defying its deceiving premise, it is important to note and consider all of the facts throughout the film, as there are so many clues pertinent to the ""stupefying conclusion"" that the ""surprise ending"" is almost pronounced by Shaymalan, and you can hardly fault him for being unfair and disloyal to the facts, for upon review, it is the oblivious viewer who has been stumped by the subtle Shaymalan. Here is a film that provides plenty of chilling suspense, enticing dialogue, and confounding mystery, and even manages to conclude on one of the most ingenious, adroit notes in film: the filmmaker is controlling all of the shots here, and the viewer is merely following his lead! Excellent direction from Shaymalan, brilliant acting by Willis and Osment, interesting and original screenplay, and overall, an ingenious cinematic effort that is more intelligent than it seems.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","A child physiologist (Bruce Willis) with a rocky marriage comes to visit a troubled boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to be seeing the dead.<br/><br/>The problem with movies is that someone has always been there first. I was lucky with Psycho in that I didn't know anything about the film before I saw it - although I would have dearly loved to see it on a cinema screen. Here I was told there was a ""twist"" and having been warned I looked out for the clues and got them.<br/><br/>(Not so sure I would have done if I had come in stone cold and just let it wash over me, though!) <br/><br/>Osment - as the little eight year old boy - is a revelation. He acts like he is thirty year old dwarf rather than a child. How does he do it? When I was that age I could barely prepare a piece of toast, Osment has to carry a major motion picture by his emotions alone. Truly as good a piece of acting as I have ever seen from a pre-teen. <br/><br/>Willis lowers his voice and tries to compete - but he is being outclassed and he knows it too!<br/><br/>This is a throwback picture in that the threat is outside and little glimpsed. It has the best of Hitchcock and a million B's to steal from; and this includes the reverse-of-norm wide shot - rather than close in on tragedy the camera pulls back as if not to intrude. There is a car accident scene where a medium-expanding-to-long shot is used in a masterful way.<br/><br/>There isn't a lot to write about this film beyond general platitudes about performance and moody setting. This is clever in that it never gives you too much to hang on to - no barrel chested hero about to come charging to the rescue. It wants to throw you off balance, keep you off balance, lead you to believe that it is going one way and then shots off in another.<br/><br/>True, there is nothing really essential about this film. Nothing that is going to change your opinion on anything - not even whether there really are ghosts and people that can communicate with them.<br/><br/>Manoj Night Shyamalam might not be Hitchcock quite yet, but at least he has learnt a few of his better tricks and has even added a few of his own.<br/><br/>Just because it is only escapist entertainment doesn't mean that it isn't also very good. It is actually very, very good."

","The Sixth Sense in many ways was excellent. The actors were great, Bruce Wills on behalf is good in mostly in all of his films and Haley Joel Osment, at that time was in the process of a new actor and he did great. Most kids in movies are little punks that I can't stand and are just flat out terrible at acting but Haley put up a strong performance and that's why, now he's a successful and famous actor (mostly because of this film.) The story was very interesting about a kid who sees dead people and comes to a man to seek help and they both become friends as he is trying to let the fears out of him. In the beginning of the film, I was quite confused of what was going on until the very end I was quite surprised. The ending had one of the best twists I have ever seen in a film yet. It keeps you at the edge of your chair and your like, "" Oh my god, that is so weird. All this time, throughout this movie I was wondering what was going on and now I learned. Wow, that's quite amazing."" That is what you will be thinking. The film was extremely interesting and detailing. There will be many parts in the movie when you can't watch and will have major goosebumps but that's the fun in thriller and horrors, shouldn't be?

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","2","6 August 2004"," very overrated
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Every few years there appears a certain director who creates a series of films which are heavily praised. M. Night Shyamalan is one of these directors, a man who creates these mystic, emotional thrillers which are designed to grab the attention and then reveal a sinister twist which appears obvious. In ""The Sixth Sense"", Shyamalan wrote and directed his first famous feature, which sadly is inferior to his later work and grinds on the skin a bit too much.<br/><br/>In this popular film of 1999, Bruce Willis plays psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe. Treating Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), Crowe discovers a child with apparent mental problems, but who will in the end help himself and Crowe too.<br/><br/>Perhaps the personal problem with ""The Sixth Sense"" is that like so many others I had the twist told to me before witnessing the film. Told on Channel Four's ""Eleven O'Clock Show"", I lost all chances of being shocked at the end. At the same time, this film does build up to the scene well. Even if it does appear predictable when looking back on it.<br/><br/>On a wider scale, the key problem with this film is that Bruce Willis is not good in it. Grinding on the nerves, Willis is infuriating as the psychiatrist with apparent marital problems. Sadly he isn't alone in the awful acting.<br/><br/>Whilst it feels entirely likely that Haley Joel Osment will one day become a first rate actor who demands ridiculous films for movies and wins countless Oscars, as a child actor, he gives off an aura of annoyance as personally I feel the urge to slap him round the face. Certain children are annoying, it's part of a childs development, but Osment is so annoying that it's a wonder he's lived to the age of sixteen. Perhaps not as bad a performance as his role of David in 2001's ""Artificial Intelligence"", Osment's role as Cole still causes me discomfort and makes me wish pain upon him.<br/><br/>The question regarding ""The Sixth Sense"" is whether the actors or the characters are the annoying ones. Willis and Osment annoy me constantly, but Willis is often superb in different films, so potentially it could be the scripting for the character. Unlike his later films, Shyamalan seems to have written characters which are neither appealing nor interesting.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is just a bit too disappointing. With intended tension, maybe it possesses this to those who have absolutely no idea of the plot before viewing, but to anyone who has even the slightest idea why this child is suffering, it suffers hideously. Improving slightly towards the end, by the time we are given one answer to our questions half way through, any interest has disappeared and the film becomes irrelevant. Shyamalan has a nice idea here, and for it to feature so highly in the internet movie database shows it appeals to some, but personally it feels slightly too monotonous and daft. Over-rated and disappointing."

","I See A Great Film<br/><br/>The movie The Sixth Sense was written by the upcoming, outstanding director and writer M. Night Shyamalan. This movie is considered to be his first breakout hit in the box office. This movie is about a child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, played by Bruce Willis who is treating a young boy with the gift of a 'Sixth Sense.' Dr. Malcolm Crowe specializes in children and extremely mentally troubled children. The movie starts out with Dr. Crowe and his wife in their house and a burglar enters. The burglar is a former client of Dr. Crowe. After many confrontations back and forth between Dr. Crowe and his former patient, Dr. Crowe is shot. The movie picks up months later down the line. Dr. Crowe starts helping the young man with the 'sixth sense,' Cole Sear played by Haley Joel Osment. After many sessions with Dr. Crowe, the young Sear reveals his horrible secret: 'I See Dead People.' This movie has many twists and turns that will keep the spectators on the edge of their seat. <br/><br/>The critical intention of this movie is used to explain to the spectators that we really don't know what is out there in the world we live in. How does the spectator know that there aren't people in the world who have extra senses like this one? If someone told another person about a sense like this, most likely that person would be sent to a mental institution and never heard of again. The critical intention is telling us to keep our eyes and ears and every other sense we have open to different situations in this world we live in. <br/><br/>The critical technique of the Sixth Sense was used in almost every frame of the movie. In this movie when a character gets very cold or we can see his or her breath because its cold, a ghost is about to appear. Also every time a ghost is in frame, the color red is somewhere in the frame to be seen. I haven't exactly found out why some of the character's hair in this movie has blond streaks in them. I'm sure it serves some purpose though."

","Mystery novels are probably the most abundant. Not to say they're not enjoyable or that many of them, or their authors, aren't remarkable. But the immense majority of them could possibly not exist and few would notice. In cinema, probably the situation is not identical: there aren't as many mystery films (although there are a LOT) as there are mystery novels. But the impact of a medium-size story in cinema or in literature is the same: it can be a pleasant reading (or a pleasant flick, in this case), but you can forget about it few days later. The thing is that people aren't that accustomed to read. The basis of the success of ""The 6th sense"" is the fact that people today isn't familiar with all the mystery stories of the XIX century and before. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been so much fuss about it. This is a movie that is well told, yes. It's story, at a certain level, is effective. But there is nothing else to it. Except for the overwhelming performance of H.J.Osment (that should have made Bruce Willis ashamed of his)."

","I have to admit right up front that I had the ""twist"" ending figured out about 20 minutes into this film. That didn't stop me from enjoying it, however.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is a child psychologist who has recently taken young and troubled Haley Joel Osment under his wing. It seems that young Haley can ""see dead people."" As Bruce's marriage slowly dissolves and Haley suffers from cruel ridicule inflicted by his classmates, the two form a bond and try to find a way for Haley to accept his lot and somehow turn his frightening experiences with the dead into positive ones.<br/><br/>There are more than enough frightening moments here, as Haley encounters the ghost of an angry, abused woman in his kitchen, a constantly vomiting little girl and a slave locked inside of a coal chute. There's also a great moment featuring Willis and a tape machine, when revelation strikes him with the force of a fist. All of these encounters are spooky, eerie and unsettling, but also highly satisfying, especially in the case of the poisoned child whose murder Haley solves. The film is quiet and sedate, even a little washed out, but highlighted with brilliant spots of red at climactic moments. It reminded me quite strongly of ""The Ring"" and its Japanese predecessor ""Ringu"" with its stark, cold landscapes and profound silences. <br/><br/>I was a tad disappointed that I couldn't be surprised along with everyone else at the twist ending, which indeed was quite a nice shock, but I still very much enjoyed this innovative ghost story."

If you expect something frightening or thrilling, you will either be disappointed or maybe you are just an easy spectator not asking much from a movie, no offense intended.

There were suspenseful moments-high-drama type score and the shadows of ghosts before they actually appear-but I thought the kid's torment over being constantly haunted was rather simplisticly wrapped up, frankly, and can you really tape a spirit?

","In 1999 a movie was released that was the topic of conversation around office water coolers throughout the country.  People were amazed at slow pace, but ever engrossing ghost story that culminated in an ending that no one saw coming.  The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense and its success went on to soak up over $300 million at the domestic box office and even garnish its young unknown star Haley Joel Osment a Supporting Actor nod at the 2000 Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The thing is, that still to this day, I don't understand all the hubbub. Was it a good movie?  Yes.  But was it so revolutionary that it deserves its standing as 19th on the all-time grossing films list? Hardly.<br/><br/>For those of you who have been living in a cave waiting for peace in the Middle East, The Sixth Sense stars Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe, a psychologist that we are introduced to being shot in the opening scenes. After what we expect to have been a speedy recovery, Malcolm befriends a new client, Cole Sear (Osment) who seems to have a gift/curse of being able to see and communicate with dead people.<br/><br/>Malcolm tries to comprehend what Cole is facing and this all leads to a revelation of his own that Â‘shocked the movie world' back in 1999 and has been copied and parodied countless times since.<br/><br/>To spend any more time on the plot would be counterproductive.  Most likely you have seen the film and on the off chance that you are coming out of a cave, well then, you might be lucky enough to be surprised at the ending without anyone telling you what to look for before it unveils itself.<br/><br/>So let's start with the good stuff first.  Director M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job in keeping us interested in the story and the characters when everyone seems to be speaking in a monotone.  Shyamalan directed only two films before Sense (Praying with Anger and Wide Awake) so no one expected the phenomena that resulted.  The Sixth Sense was also written by Shyamalan we all know how rare it is to find a talented writer/director now of days.<br/><br/>Also good are the performances.  Bruce Willis veers away from his macho persona he usually exudes and Osment and Toni Collette (who plays his mother) are great and were both deserving of their Oscar nods.  Hell, I would even give chops to Donnie Wahlberg who has but a small, albeit important, role at the beginning of the film.  All around, an A- grade for the actors.<br/><br/>Then there was the scary stuff.  You know, the things that go bump.  There are a few genuine scares with rousing musical scores in tow but it is the quiet softer moments that really made the hair on the back of your neck take notice.  When Osment utters, `I see dead people' or when we see the imprint of a palm evaporate on a kitchen table, you are swept up in a world that is more spooky that scary and the movie is better off staying on this path.<br/><br/>
There aren't many things that are wrong with The Sixth Sense and that is where I contradict myself.  I agree that The Sixth Sense was one of the better movies released in 1999.  I also believe that the premise was interesting and trend setting.  What I didn't understand was the sheer fascination from audiences around the world that put this movie into such lofty lists (80 million people had seen the movie after its release to DVD/Video in 2000).  Were we all that brain dead in '99 after Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Toy Story 2 that this film stood out so indiscreetly? <br/><br/>
In researching for this review, I can honestly now answer that question with a definite, `YES'.  Evidenced earlier with The Usual Suspects and then again in 2001 with Nicole Kidman's The Others, the movie going public has proven at the box office that if you can dupe them an dupe them good, they are willing to go back and back again in hopes of trying to figure out how you pulled it off the first time.  <br/><br/>So hats off to you Mr. Shyamalan.  Although your succeeding efforts (Unbreakable, Signs) were better films, you did set a standard with a slightly better than average film, and hey who doesn't have time to stand at the water cooler and talk about your use of the color red in the film.

","'The Sixth Sense' is a good movie but it depends too much on its ending. So much has said about it that the surprise there was less surprising. In my opinion a lot of people think about the surprise exactly as it will turn out, something that would not have happened if it was unknown that the movie had such a special ending. Of course I will not reveal it and I have to admit it is a great ending for a movie.<br/><br/>There are some scary or exciting moments and the story develops in a pretty good way, but it plays a little slow. Some people will even say it is boring in some parts and I can understand that opinion. Other things make up for this. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and especially the young Haley Joel Osment give some very fine performances, there is a creepy atmosphere throughout the movie and the direction from M. Night Shyamalan is great."

","I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it. My dad raised me to have an appreciation for quality scarey movies. This is the kind of movie that is creepy when you think about it afterwards. It doesn't have to be something gorey that makes you wince. It's something that sticks with you and makes you think about just how creepy this world can be. This movie has this potential. The only problem is - once you see the end of this movie, it really becomes a lot less interesting. You know the secret. What's the point in watching it again? Once you know Bruce Willis's character is dead, watching the movie over again lacks any major appeal. The movie is good - one time."
"Bab5er","Null","0","2","13 August 2003"," (Spoilers!!!) Never understood what all the fuss was all about...
","I watched this movie on video a couple years back on the recommendation of a sister of mine, who was very excited about it. Towards the end of the movie (again: Spoilers!!!) as the ""big twist"" finally manifested itself, she looked at me expectantly with the beginning of a smile on her face.<br/><br/>
Well, as the summary line of this review makes clear, I had to disappoint her. ""That was *it*?!?!?"" basically sums up my reaction.<br/><br/>
All through the film, what really intrigued me was *why* Bruce's character was going through such rough times. Why was his wife ignoring him so cruelly? What had he done that was so wrong in his treatment of that patient that the guy felt he had to shoot him for it? How had Bruce's character fared after that dreadful shooting? All of those questions were answered very simply by the ""startling revelation"" that Bruce's character never *had* survived the shooting. Except the crazy guy's reasons. (Guess him being crazy was explanation enough, huh?)<br/><br/>All the stuff about Osmont's character seeing ghosts and the little adventures he and Bruce had with the various apparitions were entertaining, but nothing special in my opinion.<br/><br/>What's even worse, in my opinion, is that the big ""surprise"" of the movie is not even very original. A major character not realizing they're dead was part of ""Ghost"" (1990) as well. I remember seeing the idea in a ""House of Horrors"" comic (I believe it was called) in the early eighties as well.<br/><br/>
All in all ""The Sixth Sense"" strongly reminds me of ""Twelve Monkeys"" (also with Bruce Willis, also with a number in the title... hmmmm....) - More Spoilers! - a movie that basically revolved around giving the viewer the wrong impression and delighting in making clear that you had been fooled once again!<br/><br/>I see very little of any substance in ""The Sixth Sense"". The ""he's really a ghost!"" plot twist has no relevance for Bruce's character at all, while all the little adventures with the other ghosts do not add up to much of any substance either, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The Verdict: 3/10."

The color of the screen also seems to be somewhat grayed.  All in all though it is a pretty good film, but once I watched it once I wouldn't want to see it again.  I didn't really find the ending very shocking, but then I watched this one on video and not the theater so I knew to look for a surprise ending.  The story of the movie is that of a boy who sees ghosts and has other problems.  Bruce Willis is a doctor who wants to help him.  That is all I will say of the plot, because it kind of moves all over the place."

","Horror films are usually garish and camp.  But this must be the most understated entry ever in the genre, with its mood of quiet portentiousness and overwhelming solemnity.  And though the final twist is neat, its also very clearly telegraphed.  What saves The Sixth Sense is some fine acting, from Bruce Willis as the so-concerned psychologist, and Joel Harvey Osment as the child who sees ghosts.  It's very nicely done, but not so original. Other films (Truly Madly Deeply, Kieslowski's No End) have played with similar material; and put some more life into death than we see here."

","So Bruce Willis' character didn't realise he was dead. Didn't he find it odd that he never needed to go to the toilet, or pay the gas bill, or eat, or drink, or brush his teeth, or drive a car, etc etc for a few weeks or months prior to finding HJO. And how come he found the kid, anyway? AND in the same neighbourhood!<br/><br/>It's a well directed film, but I always find holes in this kind of film. Sorry to be picky, but I have to suspend so much credibility that there's no point in the plot by the end.<br/><br/>I never liked the Osment child, but I have to admit that his performance is good in this. The film has redeeming qualities, but the basic premise is too flawed. The only bit I liked was the dead girl's video for her father.

"dalton2","10","0","1","28 January 2000"," One of the best horror films of all time, and an allegory of alienation
","Last week, when I left the theater after watching this film, I had the strange impression that I had just watched something great. Today, one week later, I'm still convinced that I was right.<br/><br/>When the Horror genre seemed to be poured out into mediocrity with films such as Blair Witch Project or The Haunting, a new one has just appeared which with no doubt deserves one of the highest places at the all-time horror movies top list.<br/><br/>Nowadays it's very difficult to surprise people with a horror movie, or simply to scare people. Everything seems to have been said and done yet. But The Sixth Sense really does both things, so we wonder, where is the secret of The Sixth Sense, if there is any? To find it out we can start by analyzing some of its aspects. Firstly, Bruce Willis does one of the best performances in his whole career (if not the best); Secondly Haley Joel Osment does an Oscar-deserving performance as the boy Cole; thirdly, the secondary actors are close to perfection; fourthly, the screenplay is one of the most imaginative ones we have seen since lots of years ago, with the best ending I could ever have imagined; and finally the music and the sound effects are really impressive, raising the stressing moments to the highest level.<br/><br/>Until now, what we have seen is plenty of good points, excellence in all the film details, but not the real secret. The real secret is (and only can be) something present in every aspect of the movie and at the same time independent from each other. What I mean is the DIRECTING. I certainly could write a thousand lines about the directing of this movie, about its structure, about its developing, about the visuals, about the ideas we could extract, but the only thing I will say about it is: Stanley Kubrick is born again! Shymalan has just become a new star in the movie sky, a new director and writer to add to my all-time top ten list. In fact, when I went to see The Matrix, what I expected and didn't get was something like this, and now I'm so glad that Cinema has finally given it to me. Thank you very much, Mr. Shymalan.<br/><br/>This film can also be viewed from another perspective: it also shows how some people are not able to see that they are emotionally dead. There's a lot of people in the USA and also in other countries who only see what they want to see, just like in the song Nowhere Man, by The Beatles. The psychiatrist was trying to cure the boy, and he didn't realize that it was *his* problem. Sigmund Freud suffered that kind of problem, and now his teachings are extended all over the USA and other countries like France and Argentina."

It has everything you'd want in a perfect and brilliant film: very good plot, fine special effects and a good performance of all the actors/actresses in the film.<br/><br/>I must admit that Bruce Willis does a great performance, but I think the best actor in the cast crew is Haley Joel Osment. In my opinion, he does the best performance I've ever seen from a young actor. The way he acts, transmitting the feelings of Cole Sear is amazing.

It takes an unnecessary cliche in the story of the little girl and her twisted step-mother.<br/><br/>I cannot however fault the films performances, Bruce Willis continues his rise from action film star to sensitive character actor, Haley Joel Osment defied my expectations as a new American child star to hate with a marvelous turn as the outsider child (surely the best USA child acting of the late 90s?). The smaller parts of the film where also perfectly cast and handled well by a new director.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* I would say that the film leaves many parts left open in it's twist ending to keep audiences asking questions for a long time (Where did the man keep a gun while wearing briefs? wouldn't he notice a huge hole in his back?) this can be expected with all twist films though.

Screenwriter/director Shyamalan isn't skilled enough to evoke suspense without resorting to trite devices like leaving lights off, or the ""Alien"" gimmick of uncovering horrors that logic says best be left alone; (2) when your son is locked in a dark closet by two bullies, you usually say something to the bullies, you don't just walk off with your babe in your arms; (3) the first reaction of a shrink to his patient's visions isn't ""I don't see anything"" - in the real world, the response is ""What do you see?"" (4) slow pacing, again for the sake of suspense, succeeds only in making the film drag in places. <br/><br/>Now, the good.  Bruce Willis is really quite good in a quiet, sensitive role, although some of this ""sensitivity"" comes across as obtuseness.<br/><br/>Better:  the story is a wonderful ""What if"".  What if we could help those who have died with unresolved issues?  Unfortunately, some plot elements introduced here are left - literally - hanging, such as those poor souls on the gibbet in the schoolhouse.

Its not scary, or weird, of freaky, or exciting, or romantic, its just plain dull."

","I think that the writers of this story were very imaginative and talented (a lot like the television series, that came on a few years ago with Gary Collins).  The principal actors put their whole hearts into the characters they were and became very real. I do hope that a sequel will be made at some time or another, because I certainly did enjoy this one.  I hope that you do too!"
"galensaysyes","4","0","2","10 April 2000"," Not good (POSSIBLE SPOILER)
","As I watched this I became increasingly exasperated by its failure to go anywhere, indeed by the impossibility of its going anywhere because of the plot gimmick it saddled itself with. The gimmick is clumsily concealed, requires cheating throughout (some of which the film tries to excuse by making up its own ""rules"" as it goes), and was a bad idea from the outset, making the story ultimately silly. The construction of the script is deformed accordingly. <br/><br/>And it isn't a skillful script: much of the dialogue is awkward, many of the characters' lines and actions are unprepared for and are never followed up on, and almost any moment that works superficially seems false and unfelt, and is usually contradicted by something else later on. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the direction is better than the writing. I recall at least three good moments, all due to performances of supporting players. But the leading actors are all miscast--even the kid--and the visuals are a catalog of borrowings from other, better ghost movies. <br/><br/>More fundamentally, this film goes against a central rule of fantasy: fantasy says openly that what is not so is so, and if the reader or viewer rejects it, so much the worse for him. It doesn't try to con its audience, to put something over on them. And I should say that that is even more true of sentimental fantasy. If it has to trick people into accepting it by impersonating a horror film (and inserting twenty minutes of one into itself so it can be sold that way), it shows scant confidence in the genre it has chosen, matching its scant skill in manipulating the conventions of that genre. Ghost didn't need to pretend to be The Shining. <br/><br/>I like ghost stories and sentimental fantasies; this is an uncomprehending and, in my view, insincere example of both."
"danhogan","Null","0","1","10 April 2000"," Stir of Echoes was better
","this movie was very overrated. Sure it was original and everything but I don't really consider it ""horror"" or a ""thriller"". I didn't feel very satisfied with the ending, and was like ""Thats it?"". Stir of Echoes was a much better movie."
"ultimate89","Null","0","1","21 February 2000"," Beauty found in dark death....
","Despite its ocassional flashes of syrupy sentimentality and boring patches, The Sixth Sense is an intense character study, generating good scares, excellent music, editing and cinematography, brilliant performances from Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette and a lingering quality in its atmosphere. Even though it is about death in dark places, there is a lot of beauty to be found in this, particularly the way in which it is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan - what a debut. It isn't a great film, but an interesting one none the less. 3.5/5"
"whitepe","9","0","1","21 February 2000"," I did not know exactly what to expect
","When I initially entered the movie theater to watch The Sixth Sense, I did not know exactly what to expect.  I liked the genre in general, and I had heard good reviews about this film from people I knew.  However, I did not expect it to be nearly as good as it was.<br/><br/>Several elements made this film a success: the plot, the acting, the special effects, and the filming staff.<br/><br/>First, the plot was excellent.  It was well thought out, and I was not expecting the ending.  Usually, I find most films lately to be predictable with minimal plot and a high dependency on special effects and explosions to sell themselves.  This film was different.  It led you one way only to let you know at the very end that your perception of the situation was way off course.  The plot had enough twists and turns to keep me interested in seeing more, and I actually watched it a second time a week later just to catch everything that I had missed the first time.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent.<br/><br/>Haley Joel Osment puts forth an excellent, believable performance as the tormented Cole Sear who claims that he ""can see dead people.""  His performance is so real that you forget that he is acting.  He definitely is a young actor with a lot of potential, and I hope he wins the Best Supporting Actor award for this movie.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis shows his full range of acting abilities in this film as well. He portrays a Dr. Malcolm Crowe, successful child counsellor who is troubled by the fact that he ultimately failed on one of his former patients.  He is using Cole Sear, a young boy with similar problems, as a way to (in his mind) compensate for his former failure.  Bruce Willis should have been nominated for Best Actor for this film.<br/><br/>Toni Collette does an excellent job as Lynn Sear, Cole's mom.  She deserves to receive the Best Supporting Actress award.  She portrays a mother who is perplexed by her son's unwillingness to communicate with her and by her perceived lack of esteem in her mother's eyes.<br/><br/>Olivia Williams also does a great job as Anna Crowe.  She believably portrays a wife who is depressed by her seemingly degenerating relationship with her husband, Dr. Malcolm Crowe.<br/><br/>Donnie Walhberg's brief (pardon the pun!) cameo at the beginning of the film is spooky to watch as well.<br/><br/>The special effects of the film were well done.  The film really built up suspense in various key parts.  The makeup and props for the dead people were done very well.<br/><br/>Finally, the staff did a good job making this movie.  M. Night Shyamalan did a good job directing this film.  The music complemented its respective scenes very well.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good film with lots of philosophical depth.  I definitely recommended it to anyone."

","The Sixth sense is a strange movie. Strange story, strange characters etc.. Strange but fascinating.I saw the film last night and till now i don't really know if i liked it.Of course it has a really Surprising end that gives a lot of sense to the all film, but....there are lots of situations that are not really explained ...... But i liked the film all the characters were great on their performances."
"txgirl4561","Null","0","1","18 February 2000"," A one of a kind!
","Finally, a good scary movie. Beside the Scream trilogy, there hasn't been many horror or scary flicks that have been really good. But I loved this movie! It's one of those films; you want someone else to watch! Thought it was pg 13, it will give anyone the chills, a great suspenseful, cool movie to see. I recommend it to every 13 or over... it's really good! You'll love what happens... but I won't spoil it!"
"Walle-2","4","0","1","15 February 2000"," Don´t like it
","Boring, uninteresting anda stupid ending that ruined that other things which the movie was built on. That´s how the Sixth Sense is. They tried to make it scary, but it wasn´t at all.I almost fell asleep while watching it. And its just the same thing all the time. The little kid see ghost and stuff.....so? Don´t care really.I think they did a bad job on this one. They really tried to make a big twist in the end, and they did. But it just doens´thold that´s all. But it´s not that bad it´s like a 5 pointer...."
"Rocket M","Null","0","1","16 April 1999"," Movie of the week?
","I like Bruce Willis movies just as much as the next guy...but I saw this movie at a special screening and I have to say that I was disappointed.  The concept itself of a young boy cursed with the ability to see the dead in a heightened sense is very cool...but...the movie itself is dragged out and long...it's as if they had a 30+ page script and tried to stretch it into a lengthy 2 hours...I'd recommend it for a decent rental only.
