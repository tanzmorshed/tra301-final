"alr126","7","36","38","27 November 2013"," Cliché'd, but entertaining
","While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it."
"drummer303","7","48","56","10 November 2013"," It's certainly not clever, but it is fun.
","To all the reviewers who gave this movie low ratings, I can only say this; What did you expect to see? Did you watch this expecting to see something deep and meaningful? The trailers and posters make it perfectly clear what kind of movie this is going to be. Heavy CGI, regular Hollywood 'save the planet' storyline re-run. Young eye candy super hot actors. You know the score. If you want to see something clever, this is not it and it was never going to be.<br/><br/>Question is, does it do the job it sets out to do? I think it does rather well, yeah OK, it's cheesy as hell and you know how it's going to end before it starts, ( the world will be saved right? ) considering it's being told in retrospect the clue to the inevitable ending is there in the first 10 seconds of the movie.<br/><br/>I liked the mind meld idea of the 2 pilots, and I thought they covered most bases explaining the technology behind the enormous robots (Jaegers) pretty well. It does have a few technical plot holes here and there, but the film does have a 'let's just get on with it' kind of feel. The alien creatures (Kaiju) are great and the robot v monster battles are superb. Towards the end the pace picks right up and the story starts to fall apart a bit, but by that point who cares? In general Pacific Rim is a fast paced, slick looking piece of techno-action that most Sci-Fi fans will enjoy. It's big, loud, dumb and very pretty, largely due to Guillermo Del Toro being at the helm.<br/><br/>It's Sunday afternoon on the sofa material I think. I know these kind of films are 'designed' for the big screen, but honestly I prefer them at home most of the time. Unless of course, you like feeling as though you are sitting the middle of a continuous explosion for and hour and half."
"land-840-861366","7","36","46","27 November 2013"," Not bad, not great
","Unlike some, I had no problem with the high concept of the piece: Transformers vs Godzilla. It had a lot of potential. And when the movie concentrates on what we are all here to see (giant creatures and robots beating on each others with oil tankers and smashing through skyscrapers) it is very successful. But when things get quiet... less so. Too much time spent on ""Top Gun"" like fighter pilot shenanigans. Not enough nuance in the characterizations. An ultra linear plot with few attempts to confound expectations. The acting isn't bad - and isn't required to be great in this sort of film - but it is nothing special either. Sort of universally ""meh"". Good for a Blu Ray rental."
"JPfanatic93","7","25","31","23 September 2013"," A Kaiju flick to end all Kaiju flicks
","Guillermo Del Toro's epic homage to the Japanese 'Kaiĵu' movies, produced on a bigger budget than all such giant monster movies of the last fifty years combined. Del Toro obviously has a great love and respect for the genre, resulting in a very catchy action flick, undoubtedly the best American counterpart to its Japanese predecessors. One might almost say Hollywood has redeemed itself for the 1998 version of Godzilla, but such a statement had better be held back for another year, until the next American reboot of Godzilla hits theatres in 2014. In the meantime, Pacific Rim works well as an appetizer to the big G's resurrection. An extra-dimensional rift opens on the bottom of the Pacific and huge beasts come pouring out, wreaking havoc on mankind as they lay waste to cities and obliterate our armed forces. Humanity quickly sets aside its internal differences and joins forces in creating big robots to fight the creatures on their own terms. Piloted by a pair of human Avatars, these so-called 'Jaëgers' effectively combat the beasts, but the life of a Jaëger pilot as Del Toro reveals is filled with personal loss. When the monsters emerge ever more rapidly from the Breach, as it is named, Jaëger command develops an intricate and dangerous plan to halt the Kaiĵu threat once and for all. Del Toro briefly explores the history of the first Kaiĵu assaults and the development of their robotic antagonists and afterwards spends more time getting us invested in the human characters than is usual for this type of film. It does make the movie feel like its dragging its feet for a while, until he unleashes the action the audience craves with a vengeance, resulting in over an hour of nigh endless monster bashing. Unfortunately he cannot help but inserting a few characters that are supposed to deliver some much needed comic relief to make sure we don't take it all too seriously, but sadly these characters – stereotypical geeky scientists as ever we've seen them – are so mind-boggingly annoying (Charlie Day particularly) they make you wish for a Kaiĵu to step on them to end their endless whining. Del Toro's talents are better suited in delving deeper into a world where Kaiĵus are not only a threat to world peace but also big business: toy companies produce action figures of them, creepy cults worship them and in Hong Kong, a 'Bone Town' is established, a black market for Kaiĵu products for shady purposes, similar to the disgusting existing South-East Asian trade in animal parts. Run by Ron Perlman (always a joy when paired with Del Toro), some of the funniest, wittiest and anatomically most unsettling scenes take place here. Though the dealings and the history of the Jaëgers are fleshed out to the fullest, their enormous alien adversaries, ever the most important ingredient in a Kaiĵu film, do remain somewhat underexposed by comparison. Unfortunately their motivations – they're really foot soldiers out to cause as much damage to mankind as possible, in order to pave the way for an invasion from their (smaller) intelligent overlords – remind us of the recent Shyamalan flop After Earth, a movie we'd rather forget entirely. Usually, Kaiĵu are more antiheroes than full-out villains, but Del Toro opts to keep them a simple threat to be wiped out instead of imbuing them with a more sympathetic character like their forebears Gojira, Gorgo and Rodan, who were always the victim of human (nuclear) folly, transforming them into avenging gods to remind us of our place in the world. The movie is dedicated to Ray Harryhausen and Ishiro Honda, two people who only too well understood the need to layer their creatures and make them charm you so you feel more for them, but in this instance, Del Toro decided not to go with such wisdom. As a result, Pacific Rim at best is a highly likable action flick, but not necessarily an apt lesson for western audiences into the true nature of the Kaiĵu genre. Then again, there's only so much you can do with the notion of giant robots bashing giant monsters. Let's say Guillermo gets as much out of that premise as we could hope for."
"thekarmicnomad","7","33","43","24 November 2013"," Epic in every proportion
","This film starts of with a monologue that explains in twenty seconds how big monsters start appearing from the sea and destroying everything. The only defence against them is to kick their heads in with massive robots. Cool! Starting so quickly out the blocks I expected this to be a fast paced action movie.<br/><br/>It really isn't. About every film element ever used, runs its course before the inevitable big battle. You get a fall from grace, a rivalry, a training period, a love story, forgiveness, reconciliation, etc. etc.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are epic, the monsters and robots are amazing, Kids especially will love them, and the action goes on and on.<br/><br/>The dialogue is cheesier and hammier than a 60 foot pizza monsters, and coupled with the extended scope of this film can make watching it gruelling if you are not instantly gripped.<br/><br/>This will keep any kids gripped for hours (nearly three of them) but if sci-fi isn't your thing get comfy and bring a pillow."
"sebasmendozacr","8","52","74","8 August 2013"," Beats from beginning to end
","Lately movies that claim to be monsters and action have proved a complete failure, and, to be honest I thought this was not going to be the exception.<br/><br/>Any change to see a real action movie with almost unstoppable battles monsters, and a dose of special effects so amazing you just leave you with your mouth open.<br/><br/>Of course, not everything is good, but entertaining plot is somewhat similar to that of other films: The hero gets a big pain that leaves the battle, then when the world needs the triumphant return finds the love of his life between the two due to the bad, the nearly died, and finally live happily ever after (like a soap opera).<br/><br/>We must clarify that thanks to special effects, battles, and good performances, the plot is not uncomfortable. I really think it's worth watching."
"mthessian","10","114","172","16 November 2013"," Loved this movie
","For the first time in many, many years with this movie I was taken away from the problems in my life and went to a place where those things didn't register anymore. It was almost magical. I had to keep reminding myself about the bad things in real life, but then a new robot vs monster battle happened and all the sudden that didn't matter any more. Total escapism done with excellent design attention and detail. Thank you GDT. You have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to appreciate this. I came out of the movie and realized all my problems were still there but I was also hearing the theme music in my head. Got the DVD now and I escape that way. Channel your inner six year old, lean back and enjoy."
"ersinkdotcom","2","537","873","17 July 2013"," ""Pacific Rim"" looks great but lacks everything else a movie needs to be good
","""Pacific Rim"" is going to be a hit with fanboys all over the planet. It's the type of movie that they feel obligated to love because of what it's about and who made it. In this case we have a movie about alien dinosaurs (Kaijus) fighting giant robots (Jaegers) directed by Guillermo del Toro (filmmaker who most Comi-Con attendees think can do no wrong). Sounds like it should work on every level doesn't it? Yeah, well it doesn't!<br/><br/>Alien monsters named Kaijus come up through a rift in the Pacific Ocean (Get it, ""PACIFIC Rim""). Giant robots steered by military officers are used to battle these ferocious extraterrestrials. Our military must join forces with the world's most annoying scientists to find a way to seal off the portal between our world and the dimension they come from.<br/><br/>Let's start out my review on a positive note. The CGI in ""Pacific Rim"" looks great. The aliens and robots blend very well with all their surroundings.<br/><br/>And that's the only thing I can come up with positive about ""Pacific Rim."" As a whole, the movie is absolutely unbearable to sit through. It escapes me how sequences of robots and aliens fighting each other could be so uninspiring that I literally dozed off at points.<br/><br/>The design of the Kaijus are completely unoriginal and nothing we haven't seen before in a dozen other sci-fi movies. The Jaegers are basically souped-up giant robots that resemble what we've seen in ""Power Rangers"" dressed in ""Halo"" armor. Booooring.<br/><br/>Now we move into character development. The entire middle of the movie is one big, long, drawn-out attempt at developing characters we will feel emotionally tied to. I completely understand the writer's motivation for doing this.<br/><br/>The problem is that every character in ""Pacific Rim"" is so annoying you actually want them to die or exit the screen as quickly as possible. Add to this the fact that not a single one of the actors seem to give a crap about their stereotypical role in the film and you have a serious problem. In a nutshell, the acting is absolutely horrid.<br/><br/>""Pacific Rim"" is a tired conglomeration of clichés we've already seen in way better movies in the past. There are so many recycled ideas mashed up in it that you could almost put them down on a call sheet as bullet points. Character who lost his brother in a past battle and retired? Check. He's being called back into duty by his old military leader? Check. Military leader gets a chance to be the hero and sacrifice himself in one last battle? Check. Military leader gets to give long rousing inspirational speech just like the one the President gives in ""Independence Day?"" Check. They're all here for your predictable enjoyment.<br/><br/>Let's just call ""Pacific Rim"" what it really is. It's Guillermo del Toro's failed attempt at making what he wished was his essential ""Ultraman vs. Godzilla"" homage. As I was running out of words to use in place of ""unoriginal,"" I came across several synonyms that describe this movie to a tee: dull, unoriginal, corny, heavy-handed, humdrum, ordinary, phoned in, stale, uncreative, unexciting, unimaginative, unimpressive, uninspiring, uninteresting, and uninventive.<br/><br/>I'm giving parents a warning in closing. There's no way any child under the age of 12 will sit through ""Pacific Rim."" Absolutely nothing exciting happens for 45 minutes in the middle, at which time they will get uncontrollably antsy and beg you to leave. This won't bother you because you'll be ready to run out of the theater screaming by then anyway."
"swp_1988","8","484","796","10 July 2013"," Pacific Rim goes berserk with a great sense of wonder, camp and old-school action.
","We all carry a great sense of wonder. It seems to hide away as we get older, but was always strong and persistent when we were children. We could sit down and really make something out of nothing physical, or tip our toy-box all over the floor and just go mad. Pacific Rim is Guillermo Del Toro at his most unleashed. He's been given the toys for his sandpit and has gone completely bonkers, but he has also created a sense of wonder from completely nothing.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Kaiju (monsters) from another dimension break through to ours and wage war on the planet and us humans must do what we can to stop them. So we build giant machines called Jaegers. General audiences are doing the worst thing by comparing this to Transformers or Battleship simply because of some simple image traits. Well I'm here to tell you that you're way off and also working comparisons in the wrong league. Del Toro has crafted an insane amalgamation of Sci-Fi, old-school thrills, special effects and brilliantly entertaining set pieces that all meld together in beautiful harmony, with just enough satisfying human moments and arcs that carry a nice balance of emotion and camp. It all blends well with the loopiness of it all. Its Guillermo Del Toro's trademarks turned up to 11, all while going nuts and having fun with his toys.<br/><br/>There's just so much to love, that not even some minor pacing problems or a couple of sub-par performances can destroy the experience. Mainly its in the lesser background characters, but for me I'd say that Charlie Hunnam doesn't quite shine in the lead. He's certainly more than commendable, but he just doesn't break out here. Idris Elba steals the spotlight with a look and a bellowed delivery and its amusing to watch and Rinko Kikuchi has such an incredible skill with her mannerism and in her eyes, that's its a shock that she isn't in more films. Ron Perlman comes and goes and works his usual incredible moments.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is triumphant above the rest of the blockbuster herd. It knows what is missing from the norm and just goes crazy with it. Its a big, giant load of awesome fun. Prepare your jaw muscles, because you'll be smiling throughout.<br/><br/>(Hint: Stay a couple of minutes into the end credits for an awesome additional scene)"
"jihun-lee0526","1","721","1207","16 July 2013"," Pacific Rim pays tribute to modern cinematic technology by proving to the world a blockbuster no longer requires decent actors and scripts
","I went into the theater expecting to see a cartoon for adults and that is exactly what I paid for.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro is an extremely talented director, producer and above all an extraordinary artist. Pan's Labyrinth gave justice to his talents and ""The Strain trilogy"" exemplifies his talents as a creator and innovator of interesting mind-grabbing stories/plots.<br/><br/>However, Pacific Rim was a horrible movie not only because it lacked substance (a clear plot, climax, resolution), but because it proved to audiences everywhere that Hollywood no longer requires decent actors and plot-lines to create a blockbuster movie.<br/><br/>The only intricacies and attention to detail that could be found in this movie was in the CG design of the so called Jaegers (Robots). Yet, the movie served to ignore the basic human sense of sight when most of the movie took place in a dark setting. It was a metaphor of how the movie itself was a black hole of cash and talent with all the darkness sucking and robbing people of their investments and experiences.<br/><br/>An episode of Beast Wars that I watched as a young child had more substance and gave more satisfaction to its audience than this movie. Pacific Rim is a destruction to the art of cinematography in that its business model lies in providing the awe-factor, shocking the audience into believing the movie is great with bling. Expensive jewelry doesn't make a woman more beautiful, it just proves that she has the money to afford it, and that is exactly what Pacific Rim accomplished.<br/><br/>The movie is just a failure of epic proportions and the fact that it rates a 7.9 on IMDb just proves that we, the collective audience, have just stopped caring. Movies no longer provide us with mind-blowing catharsis, they are now just a means of blowing off steam."
"BlairMcLovin","8","492","825","11 July 2013"," A Darn Good Time at the Movies
","Within the opening 15 or so minutes Charlie Hunnam's voice-over establishes the reality of a future where monsters (the Kaiju) repeatedly invade earth, to stem this humans have created giant robots (Jaegers) to combat them in increasingly badass iterations. This opening does a great job in conveying the scope of a film which is big, not just regular big, but like, Jason Biggs in 1999 bigg. entering the cinema from a world where these events rarely occur is initially a lot to throw at the audience, but it's handled so effectively and without tongue in cheek that it quickly becomes a world I had a blast experiencing. Maybe it was the incredible effects shots of robot related destruction used as a throwaway shots, but what I think really sold the opening sequence and the film as a whole is the enthusiasm Del Toro clearly has for the story he's telling.<br/><br/>The cast is essentially a rogues gallery of TV's better dramas playing variations on roles they've nailed in the past (see: Elba, Hunnam and Klattenhoff) and some inspired casting of It's Always Sunny's Charlie Day who, as should be expected provides some effective comedic relief. Added onto this the score comes courtesy of Ramin Djawadi who's masterful use of themes on Game of Thrones is carried over to this film for some great emotional cues and many a rad motif courtesy of Tom Morello on guitar.<br/><br/>It's appropriate Del Toro has a Frankenstein adaptation lined up as a follow up project as Pacific Rim can at times can feel stitched together from all the sources of inspiration the film has. This comes from many areas such as Japanese manga, the personalities of the actors from previous films and the imagery of robots destroying buildings which transformers ran into the ground. But Del Toro succeeds time and time again at allowing these disparate elements to fit together believably by way of some very confident filmmaking. I could easily take issue with the oft hammy dialogue and macho relationships but where the film succeeds in other areas and revels in creativity trumps the dissatisfaction one could take from these scenes. I also found Hunnams character a tad lacking in charisma and internal conflict but whatever, it's not the end of the world. Oh wait, yes it is hahahaha <br/><br/>The films successes go beyond its imagery and continued invention within battle scenes as the script is very economical when it comes to pacing. The films battle scenes are so engaging and exciting due to clearly established stakes present which left me devoid of the ""action fatigue"" transformers loves to throw my way. And although the Kaiju battles seem to never be in short supply, the film essentially follows the rule of three when it comes to battle sequences and left me oh so satisfied.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I give it points for being one of the funner summer blockbusters in recent memory, for being an original property and for its sheer tenacity to exist which all amount to what is just a darn good time at the movies."
"matthewlintschinger","7","28","39","19 August 2013"," Do you remember what entertainment is?
","Entertainment is not just a story. It is not just drama or social commentary. It is not something that can be measured by terms like ""latest and greatest"" or ""cutting edge"". This movie is not Man of Steel or Star Trek into Darkness where there is a child-like obsession with being ""taken seriously"" by adding grotesque violence or depressing overtones. This is not Transformers 3 or the Hobbit where special effects and action scenes are a cluttered mess of ADD rave parties that try to up the excitement with jumpy editing. THIS IS A SINCERE MOVIE.<br/><br/>Sure it has lack luster actors, but they are mixed with some fine ones as well. Yes this has giant robots and that is the main reason to see the film, but they are not just jingling keys in front of us. These action scenes have atmosphere. The fights are exciting because of anticipation and build up. This movie (while very flawed) should be a model example of popcorn entertainment. I came in, saw some good fights, and got a happy ending without bullshit. This was the kind of fun I remember as a kid.<br/><br/>This is a movie (strangely enough like John Carter) that should just be enjoy. They may not have had the best plots or most original stories, but they had substance that can honestly be felt. Genuine love for what they are doing in the film and real effort in making us as the audience part of that fun. They can be dumb or dull, but it feels more like a circumstance of a rushed schedule or odd-ball casting. It feels like Hollywood at its best since they just want us to have a good time.<br/><br/>I not only hope for a sequel, I hope for loving imitators who don't aspire to pretentious greatness (Rise of the Guardians), don't have something to immaturely prove (Man of Steel), and actually have their own story to tell even if its derivative (Star Trek into Darkness is not only a Rip-off of Wrath of con, but it is practically a sequel that is DEPENDANT on it).<br/><br/>This is not the degradation of film, this is the much needed laxative in a world of fast edited adaptations, sequels, and reboots with emo endings."

","This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Sure it has crazy creatures battling it out in the oceans which is just fine with me but so many elements just let the movie down.

And the head is fired onto the Jaeger via some massively complicated lift type procedure?

"jackdice","7","74","114","13 July 2013"," Oh, what it could have been !!!
","A movie that could have been great if not for the obvious flaws that drag it down. Let me break it down by sections:<br/><br/>Story, Screenplay & Dialogues: A very promising premise that promises much more than if actually offers on screen. A razor straight story line that does not deviate from the obvious and every scene follows a predictable path. Offers no surprises, thrills, twists or turns. A scrappy screenplay only serves to drag the pace, especially in action sequences...where you are itching for the mega fights only to be let down. The director tries Chris Nolan / Inception'esque trip down memory lanes, only to falter without generating any emotion from the audience. Absolutely horrendous dialogue. Completely uninspiring. Scenes where a single look should have conveyed the emotion powerfully has been diluted with meaningless words. More worse as the viewer can even predict what is going to be said!<br/><br/>Action & Animation: Very good, but could have been much much better. More slo-mo sequences wherein you can have a classic view of the behemoths colliding are missing trying to generate pace, but does not reach its mark. Most sequences happen in night/underwater adding to a jumbled rumble feel.<br/><br/>Characters: Tame and insipid. lack of character development leaves the viewers emotionally detached and not able to 'connect' with any of the characters. Notable exceptions are Elba and Pellman. Both the lead characters are eminently forgettable and do not make a impact. Director should have watched Independence day or MiB to understand the importance of character development. A leaf out of Real Steel would have lifted this to greatness.<br/><br/>Overall: Still a good movie. Watchable once with minimal repeat value. The Jaegers are awesome and just for that I rate this 7/10."
"moviexclusive","Null","120","194","10 July 2013"," Every bit as jaw-droppingly awesome as this clash of the titan robots versus monsters promises to be, but clunky in every other aspect that's not about spectacle
","As far as summer blockbusters go, 'Pacific Rim' has probably the most unabashedly uncomplicated premise - giant robots versus giant monsters. How much you enjoy Guillermo del Toro's robot-monster smackdown ultimately depends on whether you expect the movie to be any more than that. If you did, then you're probably going to walk away disappointed at how simplistic this apocalyptic spectacle will turn out to be; but if you're satisfied simply with watching huge-ass monsters and robots go up against each other, then you will enjoy every bit of this epic (and yes we do mean it literally).<br/><br/>Indeed, the draw of del Toro's monster of a movie has always been to witness the monumental series of battles between massive lizard-like monsters (referred to in the movie by the Japanese word 'Kaiju' as a tribute to the science fiction films from the country which featured such giant beasts, e.g. Godzilla) and 25-story high robots (known as Jaegers, or 'hunters' in German) operated by humans. And in this regard, let us assure you that nothing in your expectation will prepare you for what del Toro has managed to accomplish on screen - not even comparing it to a 'Godzilla' meets 'Transformers' movie does it any justice.<br/><br/>Let's start with the basics. First and foremost, the action is shot cleanly, meaning none of them shaky-cams nor extreme close-ups that diminish the scale on which it is unfolding. It is also coherent - thanks to some impressive work from del Toro regular Guillermo Navarro as cinematographer and John Gilroy and Peter Amundson as editors - rather than just a mashup of scenes that don't flow well into one another. We'll add one more before we start gushing - it is also beautifully choreographed, with just the right mix of medium and wide shots to place you right into the heart of the action.<br/><br/>If that description above seems too clinical, then how about this - these setpieces are superb; in fact, they are worthy of every superlative that you can think of. Working on a gargantuan scale, del Toro executes the action with magnificence, whether the fleeting shots of the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge at the beginning or the more detailed sequences in the middle and at the end - in particular, a simply jaw-dropping one begins at sea just off the waters of Hong Kong and then continues seamlessly inland where both the port and the very city centre gets decimated by two Jaegers battling two Category 4 Kaijus.<br/><br/>It isn't just about how colossal it gets; it is also the sheer mesmerising quality of the images, starting from the amazing level of detail of the Jaegers and the Kaijus. Even though it seems to be raining a little too conveniently every time one of these battles happens out at sea, there's no denying just how real and majestic each of them feels. On the other hand, the cityscapes are arresting in their neon hues, and the combination of the futuristic look with which del Toro paints these familiar cities with the bioluminescent appendages and venom of the Kaijus make for a particularly appealing visual palette.<br/><br/>Now that we've finished with the savoury bits, it is only fair that we get to the (ahem) less than wieldy parts, which is in actual fact just about everything else we have yet to talk about. At first, the science- fiction mythology sounds rather intriguing - instead of coming from the skies, the threat to our planet came from a rift deep within the Pacific Ocean, a portal through which the Kaijus emerged and necessitated an equally massive response in the form of the Jaegers. Ditto the functioning of the Jaegers, which given their size, have to be operated by two pilots who sync up their minds via the neural handshake, otherwise known as the ""drift"".<br/><br/>But del Toro and his fellow screenwriter Travis Beacham (who is also credited with this original story) uses these elements too mechanically. The rift is no more than an excuse for an underwater climax where the Jaegers aim to close the portal from which the Kaijus emerged, a resolution not quite different from that in 'The Avengers'. More significantly, the melding of minds isn't quite exploited for enough dramatic possibility, particularly given its significance in enabling our two lead pilots, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) to bond so seamlessly with each other.<br/><br/>Equally clunky is the characterisation, which has as much poignancy as a piece of metal. Raleigh's scarred Jaeger pilot, still reeling at first from the death of his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), heals too quickly for us to make much of an emotional connection. Mori's own traumatic near-death experience as a child that continues to haunt her also rings hollow and is equally quickly forgotten. Idris Elba plays his Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost in suitably macho fashion, but is largely one-note and engineered simply to deliver the rallying cries at suitable intervals - like the oft-heard ""Today, we are cancelling the apocalypse"" in the trailers.<br/><br/>No thanks to the plotting and character issues, the pacing of the movie sags considerably after a prolonged prologue establishing the necessary backstory of the robots-versus-monsters war and Raleigh's own past. It only picks up at the halfway mark when the deep-sea monsters finally clash again with their mechanical counterparts, which will either be stimulating enough (if you're an adolescent fanboy) to make you wet your pants or leave you numb. Our opinion? It is del Toro's most ambitious, most imaginative and probably most groundbreaking movie ever, but we wish there were more of the warmth and character that have defined some of his best work."

Yes!!<br/><br/>It turns out (somewhere in the later parts of the movie) that the monsters can be cut in half with knives and killed with fire. Wouldn't it then be a good idea to kill something like this with something that actually works, like an appropriately sized bomb instead? No, let's punch them with these fragile robots. Yes!!<br/><br/>During the debriefing after a fight, let's use the knowledge we have gained during the fight to prepare for the next fight. Wrong! Let's not learn anything. Yes!!<br/><br/>When the monsters are attacked by airplanes and helicopters they fly so close that the monsters can punch them. Who, with just the tiniest amount of survival instinct, would fly a plane like that?<br/><br/>Most of the fighting takes place in the ocean. Since the hulls of the robots are so easily breached let's protect the pilots with at least some sort of oxygen mask! Wrong! Let's not do that!! Let them instead drown. Yes!!<br/><br/>Some fighting takes place under water where vision is extremely poor. So let's equip the robots with state of the art systems to detect monsters, so pilots aren't surprised by monsters sneaking up on them. Wrong! Let them use their own eyes. The result is they don't see much and are constantly surprised by attacks they were unaware of. Yes!!<br/><br/>Since fighting can be tiring for the pilots, shouldn't we try to make the way they control the robots as effortless as possible? Wrong! Let's put them in heavy suits of metal and attach them to giant mechanical constructions. Yes!!<br/><br/>Why are the pilots inside the robots to begin with? Because wireless data transmission doesn't work in the future, right? Well it turns out it does work. But let's try and make a system where if the robot is destroyed the pilots are killed. Yes!!<br/><br/>Robots are controlled partially with the mind by something called ""drifting"". One person using all of his brain for drifting would put too much strain on him. This is just the way the robot ""drifting"" system works. Let's not rebuild that system. Let's instead rebuild the entire robot so that we need two pilots in each. Yes!!<br/><br/>To pilot a robot it seems you need to use ""drifting"". However, nowhere in the movie do you see any pilot controlling anything through the mind. But let's keep it because it is cool. Yes!!<br/><br/>Since we are equipping the robots with a few weapons shouldn't we try to make the launch mechanism fast? Wrong! Let's make sure there is enough time for the monsters to rip the weapons from the robot before it fires. Yes!!<br/><br/>Let's lift these 2000 tonne robots with 8 helicopters. Because 5 tonnes of lifting force x 8 helicopters = 2000 tonnes of lifting force and that will work, right? Yes!!<br/><br/>When fighting in a city let's walk over a few hundred cars and through a few buildings because that is a really funny thing to do and hopefully there are no people there anyway. Yes!!<br/><br/>Sometimes when they need to talk or reflect on life or whatever the monsters will wait for them to finish before they attack again. On the other hand, how else could the actors finish what they have to say? Yes!!<br/><br/>In the very beginning of the movie, the leaders of the world have realized how ineffective the robots are. So they instead decide to build walls to protect cities from the monsters. Because monsters can't climb, right? And people only live in cities, right? The construction is based on extensive analysis of the monsters bone and muscle structure to make sure the walls are strong enough, right? Wrong!<br/><br/>CGI effects in this movie are realistic and cool. The visual effects are extremely well done. However, since the plot and the story and some of the acting is so poor it really makes you wonder. If there are all these talented people doing CGI effects, why were there no other talented people involved in making this movie?<br/><br/>To summarize. Mankind is portrayed as extremely stupid. Good CGI effects. Poor directing. Poor acting. Poor story-line. Avoid."

","I just watched Pacific Rim on the first day/time slot of premiere in 3D. Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the excitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood, this is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of Godzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster, xenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to decide whether they are good or very good. :)<br/><br/>To watch this movie I needed to change my mindset to be like a 10 ten year old robot geek child, like 29 years ago. Because if not, you will feel a lot of question marks and disappointment through this movie. The story is quite predictable. The plot and pace are simple enough for children to understand. And the nerd and geek professor appearances are a bit annoying for me. But hey, that what is all about: to celebrate the childhood memory of robots vs monsters.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is great for robot vs monsters anime fans. It's not even close to that horrible Michael Bay's Transformers."

","Let's be honest, lately we've seen so much ridiculously horrible alien invaders movies that even Independence Day is like a golden classic now. Battle L.A., Battleship, last Transformers movie (was it the 9th? 11th? I forgot!), District 9 (yes, it was horrible too) etc..<br/><br/>So when I've heard about Pacific Rim I thought ""oh no, not another one"" and ignored it. Then, I saw the ratings and some reviews here on IMDb. OK another confession now, IMDb also let me down lately because people were voting like they've never seen a good movie or good script. Go look at Dark Knight Rising's IMDb rating, for God's sake! (my right eye began to twitch involuntary when I thought of Dark Knight Rising again.. aaarrrgghh) <br/><br/>But then one day destiny did the job for me, here I was having nothing to do with spare time and an imax cinema with Pacific Rim. I looked at other movies, Wolverine - check, I've already been to, good movie. Red 2, check - it was great fun. World War Z, unfortunately check, waste of time. Pacific Rim? OK, why not? After 2,5 hours the lights were on again and I was sitting with a big grin on my face apologizing from everyone who worked for this movie. <br/><br/>This is really amazing folks. This is old skool fun! This is really better than last 5 years' alien invasion movies all together! This just popped out from 80's with 2010's technology. Do not miss it! And try to catch it on imax 3D! You'll never regret it!"

","This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Everything I can think of is incredible in this movie. From the incredible CGI effects to even the awesome soundtrack this movie does no wrong. The only negative thing about the movie is the length, but with the amount of information and depth they put into the movie, one is amazed by how short the movie is compared to what it could be. Not once did I look at my watch and think ""When will this be over?"", like I do with most movies over 2 hours long. The fight scenes are very well done in this movie. You expect a fight scene between a 250 foot robot and a 300 foot monster to be cheesy and in your face but they aren't. All of the technology is explained very well and the camera angles are ones that allow you to see everything going on. I highly recommend that everyone on this site go see this movie now. Between the incredible visuals and the intense soundtrack you will almost be wishing this plot was real so you can hop in a Jaeger and kick some Kaiju ass."

"aaronjbong","Null","283","505","11 July 2013"," Monsters vs. Mechanical Monsters
","""Pacific Rim"" is a highly explosive, exhilarating, exuberant, energetic, and exciting hell of a ride. When I saw the trailers, I knew the action sequences would be massive in scale, but the film just blew me away because the scale was just incredibly enormous. Every action sequence in this film was just mind-blowing. <br/><br/>Unlike ""Transformers"", this movie has a real sensible plot. Giant monsters (known as Kaijus) are the extraterrestrial beings that are currently ravaging Earth. However, they don't come from above the atmosphere, instead they come from beneath us. A portal in the bottom of the ocean serves as the method of transport these Kaijus use to reach us. These Kaijus are arriving one by one, and as they do, they increase in size. They're so massive in size (I reckon they're bigger than Godzilla) and the amount of destruction they cause is just indescribable. <br/><br/>But the humans don't stand around doing nothing. They build their own monsters, gigantic robots known as Jaegars, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked by a neural bridge. This allows them to synchronize their movements. However, despite these mighty Jaegers, the seemingly bright future for the humans turn dim as they begin to lose the war against the Kaijus. All of this was clearly covered in the prologue, quickly but properly. <br/><br/>Now that seems like a basic plot, but I can tell you that there's actually more than that and the story is deeper than it looks from the outside. ""Pacific Rim"" provides sensible explanations for the phenomenons that occurred in the film. Now I'm not a genius or a scientist, but the explanation is logical. <br/><br/>The characters. Our protagonist is Raleigh Becket. He's had a bad time after his partner and older brother Yancy died in a battle against a Kaiju before. But he's recruited by Marshal Stacker Pentecost to pilot one of the four remaining Jaegers. His new partner is Mako Mori, a Japanese girl who wants to be a pilot to avenge the death of her family. Becket's and Mori's Jaeger is the American-made Gypsy Heart. <br/><br/>The cast behind the characters were great too. Charlie Hunnam was terrific as Raleigh. Idris Elba gave a commanding performance as Stacker. Rinko Kikuchi rocked as Mako Mori. The chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi was excellent too. But I have to give special credit to Ron Perlman (who previously played in del Toro's ""Hellboy"" films) as the black marketeer Hannibal Chau who makes a living by dealing with Kaiju organs. He has style and charisma. I also loved Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb and Dr. Newton Geizler, respectively. Their chemistry was absolutely perfect and these two were just amazing. <br/><br/>The visual effects were undoubtedly incredible. Everything was mind-blowing and the gigantic scale of the action sequences allows you to be fully immersed into the scene. And the sets were extremely magnificent and glorious. I did not feel any sense of boredom when I was watching this film. Even the drama scenes were enjoyable too. The scenes where explanations were uncovered were exciting too and the music is a prominent part of this. <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro also did a great job in his directing because I gradually became supportive of the Jaegers and every time they fought, I rooted for them to win. I became immersed into the movie. Every time a Jaeger was in trouble, I was rooting for them to get back up and fight back again. I wanted them to smash the Kaijus to pieces. <br/><br/>""Pacific Rim"" is just simply awesome. Now, it may not be for everyone, but if you love action, giant monsters, and giant robots, you'll definitely love this. Or if you're just trying to have some fun, watch this. It's got both brains and brawn. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""Pacific Rim"" is an amazing and explosive ride that is plenty of fun to watch, accompanied with dazzling visuals and a coherent plot."

"billygoat1071","9","288","534","11 July 2013"," Larger Than Life
","Pacific Rim takes inspiration from the elements of any material that involves giant creatures and robots. It shows a simple concept about piloted robots, Jaegers, fighting against sea aliens, Kaijus. This idea alone would already make a fantastic blockbuster. The surprise we get is it features more than just endless explosions. There are plenty of innovations to root for which it can almost be a new popular classic. The only less intriguing parts however are the clichés that are too known in many big sci-fi action movies. Despite of that, it kept the promise of being gigantically awesome. It's not completely groundbreaking, but it's still quite an experience.<br/><br/>Aside from the large scale battles, the film amazingly creates an innovating futuristic alternate universe. It tells the origins of the Kaijus and how the Jaegers work, shows what society and the media have become, and throw some satires of the genre. The exploration of the vision is so absorbing, it feels like you went to it as a trip. But what somewhat halts this from being larger than life is when it takes the generic elements of any typical blockbuster, like the hero's motivations, the main robot is somehow an underdog in one scene, there's an arrogant team member, sacrifices, and so on. It's hard to not notice them since they are the central points of the story. The intriguing stuff about the Jaegers and Kaijus still took over the experience. At least it embraces its own fantasy tastes without being ""dark"" and emo like today's blockbuster trend.<br/><br/>Charlie Hunnam's performance is fitting to a graphic novel based movie, which is kind of appropriate as his role. In the battle scenes, he gives genuine human emotions as he punches and fall. Idris Elba remarkably brings heart to the picture while being awesome at the same time. Rinko Kikuchi makes her character more than just a partner of Raleigh. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman delightfully serves more energy to the story, while Ron Perlman appears in a short screen time but satisfying enough.<br/><br/>Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying and the monsters terrifying than you would expect.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim will have its own fans. It feels like a self-indulged blockbuster that people will end up loving. Besides, this film is said to be Guillermo del Toro's dream come true coming from his childhood. And seeing all that, there's plenty of things to explore and to be intrigued. If only the plot can break some points from the mainstream storytelling, it would have been less predictable and much extraordinary. But physically, it is extraordinary. It's both big and eye candy which is the snazziest merit you will see. Also in the action scenes where it's more into the thrills than the fireworks, because it's all about iron fists hitting on monsters' face. Again, the story may be familiar, but the setting and the action keeps everything looks fresh and amazing."

","For almost two years since I first heard whisper of Pacific Rim, I've been excited on a level I don't recall being excited about since I first heard about Independence Day. As the gradual feed of new footage, posters and trailers began to be unravelled at the beginning of this year, I was buzzing like a fly trapped inside a jar until finally the IMAX experience was upon me last night.<br/><br/>I could sum my thoughts up in just three words - holy, f**king and s**t - but I need to put it in more articulate words that that.<br/><br/>Sometimes though, what you want to express is difficult when existing words don't quite measure up. So invented a new word which is actually a portmanteau of several words.<br/><br/>GARGANTEPITASTIC!<br/><br/>Yes. The scale of the monsters and fighting machines is GARGANTUAN! The concept and theme of the film is truly EPIC! And the whole thing is put together with such skill by Guillermo del Toro that the end product is nothing short of FANTASTIC!<br/><br/>Really, I think this may be the most enjoyable film I've seen at the cinema since Independence Day, maybe even ever? It's brilliant, and totally matched my expectations, and in the case of the actors, even exceeded them.<br/><br/>When faced with the prospect of a film about giant robots versus giant monsters, it's difficult to look past giant robots and giant monsters, but spare a thought for the comparatively ant-sized humans of the piece. Unlike the classic TOHO movies where the people are generally just there to run away and point and look up, the people of Pacific Rim are integral to the story and play a major part. Charlie Hunnam is ruggedly heroic as the Jaeger (giant robot) pilot coaxed back from retirement by Idris Elba, almost presidential in his role of authoritarian, who himself channels Independence Day's Bill Pullman speech to rapturous approval.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes is enough to sink it's hooks in, and by the time the Jaeger's take on the Kaiju (giant monsters) full force, it's delirious eye candy light years ahead of most action scifi blockbusters, with possibly only the likes of James Cameron or Peter Jackson coming close to being capable of realising on- screen what del Toro does here.<br/><br/>This is a thoughtful, loud, spectacular, engaging and incredibly impressive example of where a quintessential summer blockbuster ticks every single box. Then draws some more boxes and ticks them as well. As soon as the end credits rolled I immediately wanted to see it again, and I honestly can't remember the last time that happened.<br/><br/>I can't recommend Pacific Rim enough, and if there was a way to add an extra star to this rating then I would."

","First I will say this. Guillermo Del Toro is one of my top 5 movie directors. I own Blade 2, Hellboy 1 and 2, Pans Labyrinth, The orphanage and so on. I was really looking forward to this movie for over a year and was wishing it would deliver but all it did was fail. EPICALLY. The score I gave were for visuals. Whoever says this movie is great they are the reason movies keep getting made. I left the movie theater angry. This has to be the worst movie written and edited of all time. How would anyone release this $200 million dollar cluster fudge.<br/><br/>Writing is the key to success. The plot of the movie is that a crack opens that port's monsters from another dimension to our world. So its one crack. So answer this why didn't they try to nuke the thing from the beginning to see if it fails before creating the jaegars and finding out at the end that nuking it will fail. Then after creating the Jaegars which were like 30 of them. Why not have them on standby near the stupid crack. The reason being its proved that only one appears at a time. They track them as they appear. Correct. Imagine how much repair they will save if all 30 ganged this one Kaiju as he was entering our world. Why the hell would you split up the Jaegars around the world if its only one crack. Even if they decide to send 10 kaijus they will still fail. But now they decide to do this strategy when only 4 Jaegers are left.<br/><br/>Next when driving the Jaegers why is there a spinning blade grinder under these guys? What happens if the accidentally fall in? Wait that actually almost happened. Bad design don't you think. Next we have the guy mind meld with a kaiju brain. Now why would they do this. Oh because once the 2 kaijus defeat the 3 Jaegars in less than a minute of movie time they need a diversion for one of the kaijus to leave. Why didn't both Kaijus leave after the scientist guy? So that Dipsey Stranger can intervene and take them out separately. Then something stupid happens. The Gorilla kaiju that's left over doesn't destroy the last non functioning Jaegar. He just walks around it and punches it in the head. Then these 2 guys get out and blind him with a flare. Seriously.<br/><br/>Now we get to the kaijus defeat. Why is the Kaiju pregnant? Its proved that they are all clones. WHY? Thats easy to fix the plot hole in the scientist guy to mind meld with the baby kaiju who has no recollection of whats going on in the other dimension. WTF. Really? The thing is in an egg and it has memories. Its like saying that if a woman is pregnant and the baby is delivered I can mind meld with it and it can show me where he came from heaven or HELL. ""Because this is what this movie is"".<br/><br/>Finally the part that I screamed at in the Theater. If you read this you know it was me. What was the purpose of having a stick fight training scene if the damn robots cannot use weapons? I didn't see them us any hand-held weapons in which this would benefit them. Oh wait the sword at the end against the flying Kaiju. This is where I screamed, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME"". They had this weapon the whole time and never used it. WHY? Oh that's right. If they used it in the beginning the brother wouldn't die and the other brother would not meet the Japanese girl in which they wind up have a interracial love interest. THAT DOESN'T WORK. USE THE SWORD. Then later on create kaijus that are smarter in disabling this technique.<br/><br/>OK forget the sword. how about this. How many times did the jaegers had these kaijus by the neck and never once bothered to crush it with the robotic power? I lost count. As for the flying sucker hell my hands were free. Why not crush its neck with my bare robotic hands.<br/><br/>Then the movie finally ends just like independence day with the stupid alien looking at the Jaeger exploding this movie."
"heisenberg1925","9","99","175","11 July 2013"," Apocalypse Cancelled!
","Pacific Rim is the most ambitious project undertaken by Guillermo del Toro at this point in his career. I'm a huge fan of his work. Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy films are among my personal favorites. Anime fanatics who are familiar with Neon Genesis Evangelion will be quick to notice the striking resemblance to some of the ""mecha"" (giant robots) featured in the movie, but the similarity ends there. Although the majority of big-budgeted Hollywood movies that have been released over the years were derived from comic books, classic cartoons or novels with a solid fan base, this film is a cut above the rest. Del Toro took a risk and created his own version of ""Transformers"" far relieved from Michael Bay's commercial-like robots and in all honesty,he just might give him a run for his money. <br/><br/>In a not-so-distant future where giant beasts or ""Kaiju"" wreak havoc in major cities across the globe, our only fighting chance of defeating these creatures is through the Jaeger Program. The giant robots aptly called ""Jaeger"" are driven by two pilots where it's controlled simultaneously by melding their minds through a neural bridge. I'm not going into further detail but they completely redefined what ""drifting"" means. Other countries have joined the Jaeger Program including China, Russia and Japan but Australia's Striker Eureka and USA's Gypsy Danger were given more screen time. The intense battle scenes between the Jaegers and several types of Kaiju are almost surreal. I don't even know why they have to reboot ""Godzilla"" when this film just showed us several versions of his ilk. There was one particular scene when the Kaiju decided to take off with his bat-inspired wings and Gypsy Danger have no other choice but to shift into Voltron-mode wielding an enormous sword while suspended in outer space ( I guess they're trying to pay tribute to the classic Japanese anime).<br/><br/>Charlie Hunnam was the perfect choice to play Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot with a rebellious streak and the film's main protagonist. Becket's new co-pilot Mako Mori portrayed by Rinko Kikuchi played her part well despite her English sounding more like Japanese. However, she compensated for it with her remarkable Kendo fighting skills. Idris Elba who played Stacker Pentecost,leader of the Jaeger program delivered his part exceptionally well and steals every scene he's in. Even ""Hellboy"" star Ron Perlman had a small role as Hannibal Chau, a black market dealer for everything Kaiju-related. The remaining cast did what was expected from their respective roles. <br/><br/>There's so much visual feast in this movie to revel in for fans of the genre and for the average moviegoer looking for a more satisfying cinematic experience. After watching a plethora of blockbuster movies in IMAX 3D, I have to say Pacific Rim is a standalone film that will captivate you from start to finish."
"filmaholic33","10","468","893","11 July 2013"," Worth the wait, time and money...Brilliant!
","I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because of the two main actors Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba and I have to say I was not disappointed at all.

It was a visual feast.<br/><br/>Action was on point. The story flowed well (this is a blockbuster after all, we aren't going to compare it to an art house film). For me the actors embraced their roles very well and the visuals were magnificent (thank god once again for the 3D). Everything just felt right!<br/><br/>Being familiar with Guillermo's past work I would say this is his best yet. His imagination is wicked.

"tinjo23","8","185","340","11 July 2013"," Whilst overambitious, trying to fit a mammoth plot into only two hours, Pacific Rim still delivers.
","I was so excited to finally see Pacific Rim. An ambitious idea, carried with big-budget effects, brought to you by master director Guillermo del Toro. I was pumped. I was hoping for brilliance, something to truly give other blockbusters a run for their money. The result, as I had to expect, was not that of a game changing event. Instead, it was more or less, directly in between Greatness and Disappointment. There's a lot to love about Pacific Rim, but where it suffers seems to be mostly through a lack of confidence in it's own premise.<br/><br/>Like last years Les Miserables, Rim makes the unfortunate error of trying to fit in 3-4 hours worth of storytelling into just over 2. Which is unfortunate considering Pacific Rim's all round story is it's strongest element. Though taken from many sources, (and by no means, anything that original) it shapes a very well-throughout premise with detail and conviction. In it's execution of this however, is where the film stumbles. Mainly, the plot feels rushed. Condensing years of devastation and development, into one short montage (the first five minutes of the film covers the entire ark which Pacific Rim is built on: the first encounters of the Kaiju, the initial attempts to stop them and finally, the culmination of the Jaguar program) which contains enough story to fill an entire other movie. The intro then concludes with the untimely destruction of one of, what seemed to be, the human race's final salvation. From there is where the movie actually begins. <br/><br/>Now while that's an interesting (somewhat ballsy) approach, this structure causes Rim to feel much smaller in scope than what it actually is. This story is HUGE as a concept and it should have translated that way. Unfortunately what is shown is both giant in scale and unjustly short. The film is set over a small amount of time, considering the attacks have been going on for years and though it covers many key events in the Kaiju war, it never really feels like you've been delivered the full picture.<br/><br/>Now, on the positive side, if you focus your attention to what is on display, Pacific Rim excels. It flows with both confidence and conviction. Expecting a lot from the maker of Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2, del Toro delivers with a lot of what made him great (even if you're mostly getting del Toro, the action director). The design of both Jeagar and Kaiju are brutal and majestic. The world in which Rim exists is one where any previous del Toro film could fit in with comfortably. Beautiful design. As well as that, being this is del Toro's first real entry into mega blockbuster territory (Hellboy 2 was big, but nothing close to this) there was initial concerns that maybe he would be out of his depths in bringing the all-out-brawls to the big screen. Luckily, he delivers there too.<br/><br/>The Jaguar vs. Kaiju assaults are stellar, even if they're not the defining assault on your senses you were hoping for. When the standoffs begin, you are returned to your childhood, reminded of why you loved seeing things go bomb in the first place. It's big, it's exciting, it's unpredictable (well, some what) and it's just so must fun. Delivered, also, with a sense of peril for the characters, which is arguably the most important thing when creating great action. Which, for that, requires a group of characters to which you need to feel like giving a damn about.<br/><br/>Though things have been said about the people of Rim, I found them to be well-rounded and developed. Though not reaching the arks of previous big-screen franchises (The Avengers, The Dark Knight), everyone is given enough to go with, to at least earn the right for us to care about them. The standout being Mako Mori played by Rinko Kikuchi who holds the stand-out scene of the movie, when she first steps foot inside the cockpit and co-pilots the Gypsy Danger... <br/><br/>While on the other side of the hemisphere, Charlie Hunnam, taking leading position, brings the usual tough guy, stands-for-everything-right solider, with a delicacy that makes it feel more realistic than movie realistic. Supporting casts deliver also, with the always great Idris Elba doing well with a small role, while Charlie Day is much less annoying than what you may have previously anticipated and is convincing as the fumbling, genius scientist. And of course the always fun to watch Ron Perlman as shady, black market dealer Hannibal Chau. <br/><br/>If you take Pacific Rim as a great action/adventure story you will find much to appreciate in it's delivery. Though, were it to have the self-confidence to deliver it's premise with more conviction and pacing, it could have been the best action film of the year. For what is on display however, there is very little to hate. Guillermo del Toro has done an exceptional job at bringing this mammoth concept to the big screen and delivering in, close to the way I had hoped. In the end, what you're left with is a great, thrilling experience that confirms that big robots fighting big monsters is actually a great idea for a movie."

","I literally could not stop myself from writing this review. There's  just so much to talk about, I don't know where to begin...but let's  just get this out of the way...  PACIFIC RIM IS A 5 OUT OF FREAKIN' 5.  Guillermo Del Toro, you deserve a standing ovation. From an unbiased,  stand-alone movie point of view, this film does an incredible job of  being exciting from beginning to end, while still developing an awesome  back story and character depth.   Charlie Hunnan (of Sons of Anarchy fame) solidifies himself as a good,  respectable action movie star, but Idris Elba CRUSHES his role, and  steals every scene he's in. Solid acting all-around, much better than  what you might expect from an action movie like this.   THE ACTION IS TOP-OF-THE-LINE. What is there to compare this  to...Transformers? Transformers WISHES IT COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO  PACIFIC RIM WHEN IT COMES TO EPIC-CGI-ACTION SEQUENCES. Every hit,  every explosion, every gut-wrenching Kaiju kill is a work of art. A new  gold standard has been set.  VISUALS AND GRAPHICS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. THIS MOVIE DESERVES THE  IMAX 3D TREATMENT. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE PART OF YOUR BLU-RAY  COLLECTION. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE VIEWED ON 9 BIG-SCREEN TVS  STACKED ON YOUR LIVING ROOM WALL. Do not cheat yourself by simply doing  2D on this one.   OK, now the nerd-out part of this review. If you are a nerd in any way,  shape or form, then this movie is for you. And if you're an anime nerd,  then this is your favorite movie ever. EVER.  The inspirations from and references to Godzilla are obvious, but  you're very likely to notice influences from several different sources.  Anime fan? Then I dare you to not see the nods to Big O, Neon Genesis  Evangelion, Gundam, or even Gurren Lagaan. That female computer voice  sound familiar? Maybe that's because it's the voice actress of GLaDoS,  from the motherf*cking Portal games. Your inner nerd won't know what to  freak out over more.  5 out of 5, gold star, thumbs up, A++, 100%, NOW STOP READING THIS AND  GO SEE IT!!!"

","Decided to go see after reading so many user reviews of 8, 9 and 10. Absolutely love movies in this genre as well other movies that Del Toro has directed (e.g. Pan's Labyrinth, the Devils Backbone, Hellboy) I was expecting to be blown away - and yet, at one point during movie husband and I contemplated leaving. I don't understand how so much money can be spent and effort not made to create coherent script with believable characters. I can accept campiness if its done well - but the two scientists for example were just ridiculous.<br/><br/>The amazing visual effects were what kept us in the theater - but just barley. Could clearly see Del Toro's mastery in the creation of the aliens and Jaegers."

","Alright, so these days it costs $180 millions to make a movie that is dumber than a game of ""action figures"" being played by a couple of 5 year old children with mental development issues.<br/><br/>There is this script obviously inspired by a set of ""Mega Monster vs. Mega Robot"" plastic action figure toys. Then, a bunch of similarly plastic actors is thrown into the whole mess. Well, this is it! This awful flick is DUMBER! NOISIER! MORE BOOM AND BANG! MORE FLASHES OF COLOR LIGHTS!<br/><br/>Not that the Pacific Rim movie deserves a discussion or anything, but the bigger any creature gets, the easier and slower target it becomes. The tiny, microscopic organisms are truly scary. But any organism bigger than an elephant stops being dangerous. I will not waste my time talking about a possible bone mass and strength that a gigantic creature would require or speculating about a quantity of food needed to supply energy to a walking tower of flesh. I mean, dinosaurs died out on their own, because they were way too big (most of them were pretty big, you know).<br/><br/>So, what would stop the military forces from taking down those slow and huge monsters using tactical nuclear missiles? Do not tell me that a 10 or 20 kiloton warhead would not kill any creature of any size by essentially evaporating it (with not too much collateral and fallout). So, what happened to the tactical nukes in this movie? Whoever made Pacific Rim never heard of such weapons? They demonstrated some F-22 fighter planes (no A-10 attack planes were available?) flying at the monsters and shooting CANNONS! Well, then the makers of this movie are dumber than those who volunteered to watch Pacific Rim and then came here to leave the 10-star reviews! WHY NOT hire any military consultans??? Anyway, what is this pathetic obsession with the giant walking robots, transformers and stuff?<br/><br/>Go watch this movie and experience your IQ dropping 40-50 points. Honestly, if movies like this one are made AND watched, then we truly live under a social system known as IDIOCRACY or probably IDIOTISM."

","Awesome film. Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies of the year. The story as usual was very predictable but it was the awesome action and stunning visual graphics that really made this film work. Mr. Del Toro also does a great job in keeping this movie as family friendly<br/><br/>The Jaegers however were one of my main concerns. There were not many involved there and it too much was focused on the 'Gipsy Danger' Storywise although simple and straight forward, there might some things in the story that are kind of hard to understand but again this is the kind of movie where action is more important. However, I think people will quickly get bored with this movie after a while<br/><br/>The acting form Charlie Hunnam, Idris Alba, Rinko Kikiuchi as well as the rest of the cast was pretty solid and it was great to see Ron Perlman in another Del Toro film without his Hellboy costume this time. <br/><br/>My 1 and only complain would be there were no Pacific Rim merchandise like popcorn boxes or drinks since it would have been an awesome addition to my current collection. Oh well, can't have it all my way <br/><br/>Overall for Pacific Rim was an enjoyable ride and a must see film especially to all of you Mech fans out there"
"bbhbenjamin","10","45","75","11 August 2013"," One hell of a movie
","I went into the cinema with a couple of friends expecting to be entertained for a few hours and have a laugh, but we came out more than shocked. Sitting through a couple of this year's blockbusters like Man of Steele, Fast and Furious amongst others, needless to say I was quite surprised when I came out immediately acknowledging this was the best movie I've seen all year, not just from this guy-genre type of film.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is over the top and a whole lot of fireworks, but what puts it aside from other run-of-the-mill action flicks is that it takes itself seriously. Aside from some cliché comic relief, that at the very least was enjoyable, you were rooting for the heroes in the movie all along. What's so curious about the movie is that it starts on a peak of excitement, and it never lets go. I'm sure many pseudo-intellects would argue, but if you allow yourself to indulge in the world, you're rewarded.. Shallowly. But hey, if you can't enjoy a bunch of giant robots shattering huge creeps you must have dropped your balls too hard, since they clearly left base and rolled away.<br/><br/>Spurring you along with an exciting composition of music, you can't help but smile as these huge robots punches it out with impressive monstrosities. Much of the excitement stems from the fact that the overgrown antagonists actually pose a threat to our heroes, unlike so many other similar flicks. <br/><br/>I swear, a tendril of drool was running down my lips in glee as we see the Gypsy Danger robot be assembled. The sound is well constructed, the machines well-designed, so you can practically feel the weight of these giant machines.. And that is the accomplishment. You're not perpetually faced with the question of ""Geez, couldn't they have animated this better"", as everything is done well, opposed to lackluster examples such as Transformers.<br/><br/>In short, bring a group of guys together, go watch it and frollic. No girls allowed and no dull heads either."
"jahanzeb-farooq","8","29","46","7 August 2013"," It's got everything you are looking for!
","Totally loved it. An awesome film with STUNNING visuals. Seeing those giant robots walking in the sea alone is worth ticket's price. Del Toro's passion and perfection speaks for itself. Not in a single place you find the CGI or visuals lacking. CGI is so damn perfect which isn't a small feat given that it's a film about giant robots fighting giant monsters. And man do these robots look beautiful and awesome? Like a piece of art. And they are done so perfectly, each and every movement, every little detail, has been given attention. These giant robots really put all what we have seen in Transformers to shame. The action scenes are jaw-dropping and are so brilliantly choreographed, without ever going over the top. It's a pity that this film couldn't do well on box office while every other crap coming out every day makes tons and tons of money. I sincerely hope Del Toro gets to make a sequel."
"geri_kiko","10","40","66","11 August 2013"," The best summer film!
","I had seen the trailer dozens of times and with each time I wanted to see the film more and more. It wasn't a let down! It's absolutely stunning, even the monsters are beautiful(in their own gruesome way). The director Guillermo del Toro did a fantastic job! The acting and the effects are amazing. I loved the details that were put into the film(rust on the Jaegers;chipped paint on their Jaeger suits,so on). My favourite Jaeger is Gypsy Danger(a bit too obvious,eh?). Another thing I love about the film is the unique way of showing aliens. The aliens are obviously from another planet but they come trough a portal that is deep into the ocean,they are intelligent despite how they look and above all they clone themselves and send clones to do the ""dirty"" work. They are truly unique. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves robots and monsters and the everlasting battle between good and evil."

I've seen a lot of negative reviews and such and I'm struggling to find out where all the negativity stems from. Yes there are no famous characters in this flick, but it had a good story, good timing, awesome special effects and a great ending. BOOM!!!

I didn't see this in the theaters and wish I had given it's monstrosity far as ""big picture appeal"" and it makes sense given the material. If you're at all in to Sci-Fi flicks, robots, aliens or any one of the three you'll probably love this like I did. Giving it 10 / 10 which I rarely do, somewhat because of the negativity stream, which again I simply do not understand, but this movie is a solid movie for what it is...<br/><br/>See it on as big of screen and with the best of sound you have available!"
"JohnWelles","9","25","39","7 August 2013"," Furious Excellence.
","""Pacific Rim"", directed by Guillermo del Toro, is a science fiction film that takes a long dormant genre, the Japanese Kaiju monster films of the 1950s and 1960s. They featured such creatures as Godzilla and a variety of others, del Toro not so much reinventing it but bringing it right back up to date. George Lucas' special effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, has created a world that is in the near-future but feels like tomorrow, the textures of the both the giant ""jaegers"" and monsters so realistic that even without 3D, you can feel that you can even touch them. The effects are simply put, outstanding and so far the best this year.<br/><br/>Yet del Toro, who directed the acclaimed Oscar-winning ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and the pair of ""Hellboy"" films, and his scriptwriter Travis Beacham, know that for the film to be more than merely ""mecha vs. monsters"", real characters need to be created and invested with real emotions. In interviews, del Toro said ""We cannot pretend this is Ibsen"", so the characters like Becket, Pentecost and Mori are strongly defined people who, through the equally powerful performances from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba and Rinko Kikunchi give us a film where we care what happens and mean the final climactic sacrifices are actually poignant, as opposed to manufactured drama with little thought behind it.<br/><br/>Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, who play a pair of bantering scientists along with Ron Perlman, who is a black marketer in Hong Kong dealing in kaiju organs, are vividly sketched supporting characters who provide an antidote to the seriousness of the main plot. The humour isn't cynical or used to self-consciously comment on the film, but instead springs naturally from the characters. For a film with such a potentially risible concept and execution, it's a pleasant surprise to discover it to be so well written.<br/><br/>The art direction and design of the mechs and monsters is superb, as is the envisioning of Hong Kong, a strangely beautiful world of iridescent lights of all colours, like a pop art version of ""Blade Runner"". The cinematography of the Oscar winning Guillermo Navarro is excellent too, capturing the nuances of the oily, technical world the film lives in while also bringing out the colours for the maximum dramatic effect. The editing by Peter Amundson and John Gilroy in collaboration with del Toro wisely chooses to go for slower cuts, in particular in the many and frequent action scenes, so as to render them intelligible and to allow the audience not only to understand what is going on but also so that they know the geography of the situation.<br/><br/>The major flaw, apart from Ramin Djawadi's blandly generic score, is perhaps the action scenes themselves. Taken individually, each one is shot and edited very well, but by the end, there is a slight, creeping sense of audience fatigue. This is compounded by the fact that the film's most memorable scene is Kikuchi's flashback, which deals with the impact and aftermath of the monsters, rather than a long, extensive battle scene.<br/><br/>Despite this, taken as a whole, ""Pacific Rim"" is a whole lot of fun and easily the best summer blockbuster of the year. Oh, and stay through the credits: there is a nice little post-credits scene that deals with the fate of a certain character."
"FilmEspen1990","10","41","68","5 August 2013"," Exactly what you pay for, and then some.
","When Guillermo del Toro set out to create Pacific Rim he drew inspiration from Francisco Goya's ""The Colossus"" and said that the he wanted to give the audience the same ""feel of awe"" in the battles between Kaiju and Jaeger. And he most certainly succeeded at that! This movie not only gives you some of the best action sequences any movie has offered up this year, it also delivers spectacularly in both the narrative structure, and characterization. The characterization is done primarily through ""the drift"" and it's inclusion is just a stroke of genius.<br/><br/>In short, to pilot a Jaeger you need two pilots, since it is far to much neural interface for one brain to handle. These pilots need to be in ""synch"" so that their movements are matched. To get synced they literally have to meld their minds and then gain access to both the thoughts and memories of each other, and through great visual effects you learn a lot about your heroes simply by the movie showing it to you.<br/><br/>Another thing that surprised me about this movie is just how well thought out most of it is. Kaiju priesthoods? Kaiju body parts marked? Science departments dedicated to the study of Kaiju? This movie has it all.<br/><br/>With Pacific Rim, Guillermo del Toro not only gives you the best robot monster mash-up since, well, ever. He also shows just how much thought there has been put into this. Del Toro has made a concept that sounds stupid, into a clever movie. And in a well made universe, and with a believable structure. He also shows that a movie can still be simple, and clever at the same time. Pacific Rim is to me without a doubt the best summer movie of 2013, and i mean that not just as in entertainment value.<br/><br/>This movie, is Awesome!"
"markdocterman","10","56","96","11 August 2013"," Formula or not, this is great.
","I was hopeful going in from a review I read but it could have gone bad. Instead it went great. You know that the humans win - of course. Instead of making up some twisted plot you get interesting side stories, some surprise, good acting, good fights and an attempt at realism. The scientists were good for comedy without being annoying. I only recognized one actor so I saw some new people who were great, like Elba and Kikuchi. A part of the opening is how so many countries worked together but there is no message that would serve no purpose but would be heavy-handed.I didn't see any of the Transformers movies; I will make a comparison to Independence Day."
"Field78","8","26","41","9 August 2013"," This year's guilty pleasure!
","Let me start this review by voicing my genuine surprise: why in the world has this movie been so well received? I know that *I* liked it, but I am not afraid to admit that I also liked the Transformers movies, the first Alien vs. Predator, The Grudge, and (here goes) the Star Wars prequels. I can't shake the feeling that if they had called this movie 'Transformers 4', nobody would have noticed the difference. As always, critics would have universally panned it for its over-reliance on big, ear-deafening action scenes, and the majority of moviegoers would have blasted it on every review site, yet somehow earning it over a 100 million dollar in box office anyway. I can only guess that the name 'Guillermo del Toro', creator of such visual treats as Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy, made people let go of their Michael Bay-evoked preconceptions, and enjoy it for the fun it surely delivers. Just like the addition of 'Directed by Quentin Tarantino' can change something from ""excessively dialogue-ridden dud"" to ""wonderfully inspired B-movie homage"".<br/><br/>It is funny how many people praised the gigantic CGI-battles in this movie, where they would normally balk at such spectacles as looking fake, excessively drawn-out and so fast it is impossible to follow. Although the 3D didn't make it more comprehensible for me, it did make for some awesome sequences. Nothing we haven't seen before, though: if you know Transformers, Cloverfield, Godzilla and Independence Day, you can pretty much see where they assembled it from. 'Original', as overly stated in some reviews, is therefore not my word of choice.<br/><br/>But, let's be fair: the influence of del Toro does manifest itself on a few occasions. More care seems to have been taken for some of the main characters than is usual in a multi-million dollar blockbuster. Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi get some nice background and motivation for getting inside a big robot and beating the hell out of a group of monsters. But that's about as developed as the characters get. If you've ever seen a recent blockbuster disaster movie, the rest can be easily classified: the loud-mouthed annoying bully who gets to redeem himself; the black man who gets to sacrifice himself (fortunately, he was already terminally ill); the anonymous cannon fodder, and so on.<br/><br/>I love a good bit of comic relief, but the two 'funny scientists' in the movie made me cringe worse than John Malkovich, Ken Yeong and John Turturro did combined in Transformers 3. Fortunately, there's Ron Perlman, del Toro's secret weapon, to show that you don't need to overact hysterically in order to be funny (watch out for the scene during the credits!) <br/><br/>The addition that a Yaeger must be operated by two symbiotically-linked people is a particularly nice touch. So, with such a spark of inspiration, you'd wonder why del Toro would make do with a screenplay that has holes large enough to accommodate the entire Yaeger battalion. I almost found myself yelling such phrases as ""why the hell didn't you use that sword three battles ago, saving precious lives and dollars?!"" and ""wow, a Kaiju with an EMP, what a convenient plot device just when the story calls for some drama!"" And how can two escape pods get through that Breach without a Kaiju attached to them? I am eagerly awaiting the ""How it should have ended"" video for this most blatant disregard for internal logic since they built a second Death Star with another obvious design flaw. <br/><br/>What I won't deny is that Pacific Rim is good fun. In fact, if it was del Toro's intention to make an homage to B-monster movies complete with all its genre flaws and conventions, he has succeeded gloriously. Halfway, I simply shut down my brain and enjoyed, and afterwards, I had a good laugh with the other moviegoers over the many silly things we witnessed. All in all, this is not the presumed masterpiece it is generally taken for, but a typical summer movie I enjoyed for its sheer spectacle and goofiness; I simply did not expect the main audience to embrace it so easily."
"gopaulyogesh","10","26","41","13 July 2013"," Easily one of the best for action this year!!!!!
","Well, Man of steel and star trek were quite big movies this year and I thought they would be the pinnacle of effects and storyline. Well DAMN!!!!!!! Pacific Rim has a well balanced story and Effects combo that carries you with it.<br/><br/>The story takes it's time to build up but the movies starts straight in with action and grabs your attention straight away and you can't help keeping on watching to find out what the hell is going on. The comedy geeks were a good addition in my opinion deviating slightly from action and sad background stories.<br/><br/>And the action sequences!!! Well they were pretty damn good to say the least. Picture a transformers fight where you can see every single move perfectly, a combination of wrestling and martial arts. If anyone remembers the power rangers zord mode, well the sync inside between the pilots looks the same but cooler and less cheesy. <br/><br/>The acting was AMAZING!!!!! Idris Elba was perfectly cast to deliver those lines with a punch (couldn't help but think of him in Luther in some scenes!!) The other actors carried their roles with panache and depth which made it more believable.<br/><br/>All in all a good action story which I would easily watch again!!!"
"devadhodhan","10","44","74","15 August 2013"," Del Torro I salute you
","I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because I thought it would be like the transformers franchise. Watched it in 3D(I have always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was a visual feast and you cant imagine a movie better than this for visual effects/dialogue delivery.<br/><br/>Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying and the monsters terrifying than you would expect."
"dewetnmail","10","44","74","31 July 2013"," 3D marvel and amazing film
","This week I watched Nelson Mandela pilot a giant robot in order to fight monsters in Guillermo del Toro's, Pacific Rim Okay, not quite.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is visually unparalleled in the kick-ass-destructive-giant-robots-meet-alien- monster-mash-up movie genre. It's one of the very few movies where the 3D was done with such an art that you can't help but marvel at how amazing and effective it is. You see, the problem with the 3D gimmick is that it normally takes your eyes at least as long as the opening scene to acclimatize to the 3D, which is a waste if you consider that you're watching a film at almost triple what it would normally cost you. Plus, you're wearing awkward plastic goggles on your face which only seem to dim the brightness of the screen.<br/><br/>In Pacific Rim there are a number of devices implemented to re-enforce the 3D effect with intelligently placed objects that work to refresh the neutral depth–which basically means you don't have to take your glasses off every 20 minutes or so. Bottom line: the 3D in Pacific Rim is worth its price.<br/><br/>If you thought you saw the entire film when you watched the trailer, you are very much mistaken. Apart from two clips, the trailer only covers the events in the first 25-minute opening sequence. Pacific Rim is a lot larger than what I expected! True to del Toro form, Pacific Rim has a lot of depth and isn't simply a film with a narrow backbone to carry a visual and action-filled spectacle. Guillermo del Toro has already voiced his plans for a sequel, and, after watching the first film, it looks like it's going to be on par with the best of them.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is a must-see film! It's more mature and polished than the Transformers franchise and easily the best film I've seen this year."

Actually it beats most of the latest ""invasion"" sci-fi movies on many levels. The movement of the giant robots feels very real thanks to the excellent visualization and sound mixing. The main music theme *is* present every-time when it's needed to build that feeling of justification and awesomeness and it's epic presence is appreciated by the little boy in me watching the monumental scenes with eyes glued to the cinema canvas. It's *maybe* not taking itself very seriously, and characterization is quite flat, but the ""threat"" still feels more serious than in movies with similar themes. I couldn't get rid of the wide *cheshire cat grin* on my face when I was driving back home. It was *that* good. Thank you Guillermo del Toro."

The story line was great it went into correct amount of depth and was not just action action action. It starts off with a great action scenes and then takes some time to build the plot. Then it goes into awesome action scenes and also had a great ending. Definitely worth watching in 3D. I know that this movie was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D for the theater.

","Okay, don't get me wrong. This movie was a thousand times better than any of the Transformers movies. I'll tell you why: the story was better, the effects were fantastic, and to be honest, the Gypsy Danger and Cherno Alpha truly made me feel small compared to Optimus Prime and Bumblebee.<br/><br/>The tagline of the movie sold me: To fight monsters we created monsters. If you don't know anything about the movie, just learning the tagline gives you a general idea.<br/><br/>What makes this film truly amazing to me is the fact that it was mesmerizing like other of my favorite visual effect movies like Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and James Cameron's Avatar. The acting was also great. The graced performances of Idris Elba (Golden Globe winner, Luther), Rinko Kikuchi (Oscar Best Supporting Actress, Babel), Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy), and Ron Perlman (Golden Globe winner, Beauty and the Beast) were seen as clever and entertaining.<br/><br/>Some before even seeing the film might have said that this movie was all visuals and has no real plot, but they were proved wrong. The story was solid and creative. And yes, the big robotic machines were awesome, but the story was too. <br/><br/>Now seeing this movie in IMAX 3D is the only way you can have fun at the theaters. Seeing it regularly at the movies isn't as ""magical"" as IMAX 3D is. Not only did the effects look great, but the sound was too. The heart-pounding stomp of the Jaeger's (German for ""hunter"", the gigantic robots created by the humans) monstrous feet treading through a destroyed city made you feel like you were standing right in front of it. The roar of the colossal Kaiju (Japanese for ""strange creature"", the monsters of the movie)coming out of the water made you tremble in fear. <br/><br/>What else is there to say? This was one of the best times I've had at the movie theater since seeing Man of Steel. When this comes out on Blu-ray, I am buying it and putting it in my favorite films collection. <br/><br/>Now if this movie isn't nominated for at least ONE Oscar, I will truly be disappointed with the Academy..."

","Almost a great Movie-liked it really with the theme sets and the way soundtracks and directions fade in for the screenplay apart from the Monster and robot thing may seem to be childish to some still the way the movie theme in 2020 how Humans adapt to use technology wise as per the circumstances is well depicted. The way the action is choreographed is best even if its a robot fighting- The fights seems like more Human to a Monster and it was Stylish. Movie rating as per my thoughts is perfectly 8.5/10. The Storyline that makes the Human world to be almost responding to a catastrophe even though its strange from normal-the Movie is perfectly scripted.

I would call it ""Godzilla vs Transformers "" for a Saturday morning kid show . but to cough up $50.00 for 2 adults and 2 kids to see this movie,is just not worth it.My opinion was not the only, my wife and kids hated it too."

","I was drawn to this film with a bit of apprehension, based on the trailers and the thought of sitting through one more predictable Hollywood summer sci-fi blockbuster. It was Guillermo del Toro's previous work that got me over the threshold (Cronos, Pan's Labyrinth). What I got was a feast for the eyes and ears that draws from inspiration from virtually every popular international genre, from Hong Kong martial arts movies to Gothic horror and Japanese Anime and then adds the unique sensibilities of a director with a unique vision who knows how to bring it across in a BIG way. He knows how to stretch our credibility beyond the limits and make it work using a great cast of character actors adding to the strong chemistry between his three leads, Hunnam, Elba and Rinko Kikuchi (in a very strong performance). <br/><br/>Remember all those Japanese monster pictures where huge beasts come out of the sea and smash up Tokyo? Remember ""Cloverfield?"" (this movie explains that one) Roll all of these up with today's effects and Guillermo del Toro's weird design sensibility and then tell yourself, ""Let's take this one TOTALLY over the top"" and you've got ""Pacific Rim."" As an action flick, from the first shot it never stops or even slows down. The scenes with the little girl in Hong Kong (i think) are particularly chilling and uniquely part of del Toro's signature - (he understands children and terror). This film makes ""The Avengers"" look sedate.<br/><br/>Besides being an extremely entertaining, good old fashioned monster flick, ""Pacific Rim"" is a tribute to the strength of international cinema, involving artists and production teams from every part of the globe. I imagine this will be a HUGE international hit."

","Pacific Rim is a movie for people who get distracted by shiny objects.<br/><br/>There is no plot, no suspense, no drama, no humour, no attempt at characterisation . All there is, is a big pile of CGI and a script that looks like it was written by a four year old.<br/><br/>There is LOTS of cgi. Its not very good CGI and it completely fails to disguise the fact that the movie is idiotic and lazy, with nothing to offer anyone except the completely undiscerning viewer. The film even has much of the action taking place in poorly lit environments to attempt to describe the lameness of the effects. <br/><br/>The actors do their best, but even Idris Elba, whose work I normally enjoy, is completely wasted in this trash."
"pec_on_me","1","113","211","16 July 2013"," Power Rangers has more Story than Pacific Rim!!
","Just saw Pacific Rim last Saturday and my verdict disappointed. Here's why first of all we know the kaijus don't attack earth very frequently and biggest kaiju which is say category 5 is like 40 storeys tall the world has enough weapons be it artillery or bombers to destroy a whole city block easy.So killing each kaiju every time they show up should be a piece of cake(Its like we just gave up). Remember Godzilla(Same Size)..the military killed it like in a day..Second. Its just another fight in the city and building collapsing. Third the only so called epic battle scene was the one in Hong Kong where Gypsy Danger hit one of the kaiju with an oil tanker, but that lasted like 40 secs. Three. I thought the Russian and the Chinese robots will show off some killer fight sequence but they all died the moment the step their feet in the sea(whats up with that). Fourthly Edris Elba's character. I thought he had enough war experience that the movie had something installed for the end so that he has a glorious death as a symbol of resilience but meh...nothing there too...there was hardly any fight and he self detonated even before a real fight began...Finally why do they always fight during the night I couldn't even make make whats what..between..monsters...the metal and the city ruins..So on in all.. This was a big disappointment... whats next since the monsters are gone..do we all live in peace???"

","Pacific Rim is a fun visual spectacle with lots of heart and soul poured into it. Best movie of 2013. Guilermo Del Toro wrote a poem to our childhood awe at monsters and heroes. I'm sorry for anyone who didn't get it.<br/><br/>Plot: It's the story of a world being threatened by powerful external forces and the human resilience rising to fight against it. Instead of the brain dead grim pessimism of the dark, gritty movies of today we finally get a story where we can see some hope humanity can rise above its own pettiness and become better.<br/><br/>Characters: Its easy for characters to be engulfed and forgotten when larger than life events occur but in Pacific Rim their personalities rise against the tide and do not let themselves disappear. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi/Mana Ashida) are great and powerful characters. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) steals the show, he's just amazing. Even the piloted robots have personality here.<br/><br/>Effects: Just perfect. The Robots and monsters are completely convincing and visceral. They are beautiful and creative. The Robots' control room are very creative as is the concept of drifting.<br/><br/>Overall this a work of love that deserves to be appreciated by anyone that still have a beating heart and a creative mind. It'll awe you."

","Because Pacific Rim only had the insufficient clout of its pathetic PG-13 rating, all that this ""Transformers"" rip-off movie amounted to was just director Guillermo del Toro's infantile concept of a 13-year-old boy's wet-dream.<br/><br/>I honestly swear that after the 2nd of what seemed like an endless stream of mind-numbing battle scenes, I had developed a serious case of brain-freeze. It's true.<br/><br/>Predictable beyond belief, Pacific Rim was a mindless mess that held absolutely no surprises, whatsoever. The most damaging aspect of this film's story was that it clearly took itself way too seriously for its own good.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned this film's story was just another variation on that old, stale theme of little boys who want bigger toys.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim may have been a colossal $190 million production, but, to me, the overall return on its dollar value amounted to no more than one percent of that sum as far as its entertainment-factor stood.<br/><br/>When it came to all of the cookie-cutter characters who prevailed in Pacific Rim, I really resented the emphasis that was placed on a bunch of cocky, self-centered jocks who were the ones intended to save the day. And the quirky repulsiveness of research scientists, Gottlieb & Newt, actually made me cringe every time these 2 despicable twits made an appearance on screen.<br/><br/>At an overlong 2 hours and 10 minutes, Pacific Rim could've easily been edited down to 90 minutes and, believe me, in the long run, it wouldn't have made even the slightest difference to the final outcome of its truly nonsensical story."

","It has a good score here on IMDb, but again it proved to be highly overrated. I gave it a 5 because it would have been much better, and contains no serious logical mistakes. It looks like the creators wanted some easy money, so they mixed everything together: robots, some fightings, aliens, etc... But. The story is poorly written, and basically follows a well known, and unbelievingly boring, and predictable path. No surprises at all. It's like nowadays no one really cares to write a good and exciting story, they concentrate only on the CGI effects, and they think the rest is not important. They copy-paste it from other movies and that's it. Apparently it looks working, sadly..."

"fawn_jane","9","27","44","2 August 2013"," Awe-Inspiring, Visually Stunning
","I loved watching this movie in 3D in the theater! This movie made me feel like a kid again, I was absorbed and entranced by the stunning, colorful action and visuals. It's the kind of movie that gives you something to daydream about. I loved watching and idea of these giant robot Mechs. Gives you that I-love-science-and-technology feeling.<br/><br/>The entire movie has this quality I have never seen before, wherein the feel of it was bleak and gritty, but at the same time it was very colorful and futuristic and fantastic.<br/><br/>These days in action movies often the action sequences are hard to follow because the director employs too many cuts and blurs, I assume to make it seem more exciting. But here I never had the thought, as I often do in other action movies, ""When is this action scene going to end... yawn... what is even going on?""<br/><br/>I took off one star though because the movie isn't perfect. For instance, the main character is extremely forgettable, I could not even tell him apart from this other more minor character in the movie that looks similar. And then there was Elba's character and performance, there was something off about it. It's hard to put into words, the delivery of his lines was unconvincing at times: flat or the timing was off.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the female lead. She's a gentle soft-spoken Japanese woman, and the movie does not apologize or overcompensate for it. Her character isn't the generic female lead who sneers at Mr. reckless rebellious protagonist at first and then gets won over and falls in love with him. Instead the male and female leads develop a hearty platonic friendship based on mutual understanding and shared experience.<br/><br/>The movie had a rainbow of colorful characters, like the goofy scientists, the bleach-blonde rockstar-looking russians you see in the background, Ron Perlmen's character, they were all welcome comic relief to whole serious aliens-are-trying-to-wipeout-all-of-humanity situation.<br/><br/>The movie is well done, but there is no denying it is completely formulaic. I instantly saw so many parallels between this movies and for example, Independence Day. The film is very much classic Hollywood, three-act, Joseph Campbell's-Hero's Journey stuff.<br/><br/>And the whole premise of the movie doesn't make sense. If aliens were attacking earth, why would you build two-legged humanoid mechs to punch them and shoot at them at close range? Makes zero sense from an engineering standpoint. But all that is forgivable because after all... MECHS! But still worth pointing out... there are other things in the movie like that but I won't get into it.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie are amazing, and the director knew what he was doing with them. There were so many points in the movie where I was just in awe of how beautiful and well-put-together the action and special effects were. Moments where I appreciated watching something that felt absolutely PERFECT.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for a colorful action movie, run to the theaters now! I could see someone not liking it though if they need something deep or logical, this movie is a fun formulaic action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously."
"oecobius","1","21","33","30 March 2014"," Derivative schlock
","Pacific Rim is an exercise in unoriginality. By the end, I desperately hoped that the filmmakers had intended some cynical meta-theme about the poor state of Hollywood films today, but I gave up hope upon reading the pretentious boasts by Del Toro and his cronies who apparently took this boring popcorn flick dead seriously.<br/><br/>The plot is paper thin and not very interesting, mainly because the film is too scared to go anywhere remotely clever or deep with its characters, message or general story. Del Toro has said the message is meant to be the simple ""we all should work together."" Even though this statement is cheesy and borderline meaningless, it could theoretically work with enough wit & creativity. Instead, all the characters are annoying stereotypes, and the film's ""message"" is conveyed in the laziest way possible. Most of the so-called ""character arcs"" are basically ""2 characters fight like whiny teens, eventually 1 of them does something helpful or useful, the other guy immediately pulls a 180 and decides they're friends."" <br/><br/>I couldn't stand the 1-dimensional, boring characters. Even the central protagonist we spend the most time with never amounts to anything more than an annoyingly smug, whitebread hero whose ""generic action hero"" screaming voice will have you rolling your eyes throughout the 2nd half of the film. The female lead is so flat and bland that she constantly waffles between the extremes of an ""impressive talented spunky chick"" stereotype or an ""unreliable weak woman"" stereotype. Whatever the case, the filmmakers clearly thought audiences were too stupid to understand any characters who act like nuanced, 3-dimensional human beings. The lack of any worthwhile story, message or characters is a huge insult to the audience up-front.<br/><br/>Without a decent story or characters, what else is there? The special effects are widely praised, but every time the monsters or robots were on screen, I was acutely aware I was watching a special effect. The big CGI fights are trite and predictable with no distinct personality; they're the kind of thing Hollywood has done countless times before and will bore you to tears if you're older than 12. It feels as if the effects crew made a generic CGI effects showcase and the rest of the film was written around those hackneyed action scenes!<br/><br/>Even the soundtrack is typical & unoriginal. Most of the time you don't notice it there, but in the ""dramatic"" moments you might notice the incredibly cheesy and corny ""scary"" or ""triumphant"" cues, again completely bland and generic.<br/><br/>There are so many elements that serve NO purpose in this movie other than to be as derivative and unoriginal as possible. For instance, the pilots feel pain when their robot gets hit. Why? This adds nothing to the plot or message, but Evangelion did it so Pacific Rim needs to steal the idea. The computer voice is distractingly Glados from the Portal video games. Why? There's no clever reason or hidden meaning; it just adds to the vibe that this film is a patchwork of borrowed ideas for one meaningless mishmash. You could no doubt write a shot-by-shot analysis of all the influences and sources this flick rips off, and I'm sure that all the original sources this film steals from would be way more entertaining and worth your while than this bloated pastiche.<br/><br/>I won't even bother touching on the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies. The internet already has a LOT of material about the ludicrous flaws that pepper the film's already flimsy script. Personally I could forgive the countless illogical concepts surrounding the plot if it were a story worth telling, but Pacific Rim never even comes close.<br/><br/>If you want a film with any respect for its audience, skip Pacific Rim. This film seeks only to make easy cash by giving people the same things they've seen before, except without any cleverness or depth that might make them interesting."
"seaview1","8","21","33","21 July 2013"," Pacific Rim Is a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Thrill Ride
","Director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) has always had a fascination with fantasy and science fiction stories populated with unusual, colorful characters amid macabre settings. Originally set to direct The Hobbit films, he has, instead, switched gears and created a new film populated with mega monsters and super robotic warriors in an exciting, action spectacle, Pacific Rim. What sets this apart from most apocalyptic battles is its well developed characters and relationships. While its subject matter may not be for all tastes, it should satisfy most action and comic fans to the hilt.<br/><br/>Set in the not too distant future, a growing threat emerges from an ocean breach in the form of enormous monsters (think Godzilla types) called Kaijus which ravage world cities. To combat these powerful creatures, world leaders construct giant war machines dubbed Jaegers which are controlled from within by a set of mind linked co-pilots. But the threat increases, and the creatures, who have remarkable, adaptive powers, duel with an ever dwindling number of outmatched Jaegers. While mentally linked, the copilots share each other's thoughts and memories. Ace pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) has traumatic memories of loss from an earlier battle and must learn to overcome this while the prospect of a new co-pilot in the form of Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) brings her own horrible past. As relationships are revealed and challenged, the monstrous Kaijus must be met in a last stand not only on land but at its mysterious source beneath the sea.<br/><br/>While there is undeniable sexual tension between Becket and Mori, the filmmakers do not settle for clichéd romantic scenes, which a nice change of pace. The film deals primarily with facing and conquering one's own demons. Themes of loyalty, duty and sacrifice crop up. There are super mind melds and a nice dash of samurai mentality in the training and battle scenes, and there are elements of other action films like The Matrix and Top Gun especially towards the end. <br/><br/>These Jaegers have some awesome, cool weaponry, and the high tech hardware is detailed and impressive yet well used and realistic. Movies such as The Transformers and the recent super hero films have raised the stakes of massive battle sequences in an urban setting, but Pacific Rim enlarges the playing field even more. And these monsters have tricks up their sleeve that would make even Godzilla envious. Although the scale of the film is breathtaking, del Toro always keeps things grounded in reality and honest emotions. These characters have a camaraderie that evolves throughout the storyline. Just like Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings films, del Toro demonstrates an impressive ability to marshal large set pieces while throwing in minute details or intimate moments. These things add to the texture of the story and its players; you begin to care for them. <br/><br/>Idris Elba is fast becoming the actor of choice (from his start on TV's The Wire through the recent Prometheus). His role as the leader of the Jaegers, is critical to the storyline, and he even gets to have his own Independence Day/Henry V rallying speech. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are a riot as rival scientists who bicker while trying to find solutions to the crises. Long time del Toro repertory stalwart Ron Perlman has an amusing supporting role as a black marketeer.<br/><br/>Production credits are outstanding on all facets. Special effects are through the roof, and the score by Ramin Djawadi is appropriately heroic and pulsating. Do stay for the initial end credits for an amusing bonus scene.<br/><br/>If this is not your cup of tea, it is best avoided. It is true there are perhaps too many climactic battles of these titans (Del Toro even displays a hint of shoe fetish). Yet for those who are game, it is a fun ride and a cut above typical sci-fi fare. For fans and geeks, it is nirvana. <br/><br/>If you're going to make a film about giant war machines fighting larger-than-life evil to save the earth and instill the requisite human element, this is a textbook example of how to do it right. Imagine that: a sci-fi blockbuster that moves you! Boy, they are going to sell a lot of toys with this one!"
"rocksburynevins-736-416575","10","22","35","12 October 2013"," Excellent.
","First off I want to start by saying that anyone who refuses to accept or challenges the concepts of mind melding and giant robots is purposely disregarding whatever story world the movie is set in.<br/><br/>The technology used in this movies world is fan fiction for the lovers of Mecha Anime. Gundams, Evangelions, Laganns all relied on the pilots mind as well as skill which is fully represented in Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>I can agree with people questioning the methods used to fight giant aliens and most people would assume large caliber weapons from distance rather than close combat but remember this is a world that invested trillions into a robot fighting force lets all pretend its a great idea...also remember it worked wonders for humanity until larger monsters started to break through. <br/><br/>Character progression was rather dull the pilots generally don't all agree with one another. In a Hollywood film you're stuck on rails anyways so the love interest, father figure, jerk, and clueless scientist are all present and overall done well considering they are designed to be those characters not reinventing the wheel. <br/><br/>The combat, Devastation and unique art style all gave this film an incredible environment. In full 1080 on a big screen surround sound you can start to think this is what a Gundam movie might look like if Americans embraced it.<br/><br/>Sadly most people who watch this film will be turned off by the worlds technical settings and obvious attempts to recreate Japanese anime. Fact is North Americans are not exposed to that media and are not familiar personally I found this movie to be excellent. Forget about how a robot could stay submerged with hull breaches, forget the fact that the machine can get tossed around and the nuclear core doesn't blow, hell forget about the fact that the aliens didn't just open more rifts and send the whole army.<br/><br/>Its an excellent experience if you want giant robots fighting giant aliens with huge explosions and flashing lights."

","The thing about a movie like this is, we all want to see the big robots fight the big monsters. Simple as that. The downside is, you have to suffer all the boring drama bits between the action to get there.<br/><br/>I've never understood why it is so many directors feel they have to have some tedious love interest in action flicks, it just totally takes the edge of the tension. Then we have the really nerdy and half crazy scientist types who, while portrayed as seemingly brilliant in their field, come across as almost insane. Has anyone ever seen a scientist behave like this? I mean in the real world? Nope, me neither, but it seems movieland feels that's how we should see them all. It's bloody irritating if you ask me. And Pacific Rim has its very own who really bugged me while on screen. Please can we have some normal scientists in these kind of movies please? Although given the plots are so outrageous maybe that just wouldn't work so well.<br/><br/>Anyway, getting to the action. It's good. It's really good, although sometimes it's a little hard to make out what's going on during the close-up fighting. Among horror fans, CGI is hated, as we love the day's of olde with lashings of fake blood and latex, but without the runaway developments of CGI it would be impossible to make a film like this. I reckon Pacific Rim is the ultimate demonstration of the top end of where we are right now in computer based effects. What you see on screen is truly stunning, moreso the big manmade battle machines than the monsters I must say. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie a lot. It's maybe a little over-long with those slow drama scenes, but the onslaught of the mega battles certainly makes up for that. Good stuff then, for something so big and hollywoodesque."

I would have enjoyed it if they had put more time into explaining the development of the machines more.

I'm in no way a professional, so take this with a grain of salt, but it seemed to me that the visual fx department did wonders with the context and they were top notch (applauds).<br/><br/>That said, I had two problems with this movie: acting and story.<br/><br/>I have to say, acting was really sub-par and it didn't really make me want to see any other work of the actors/actresses involved. (Except Ron Perlman :-) ) And I'm sorry to say this, but Dr. Geiszler's voice was beyond annoying. I haven't seen Charlie Day in any other production and I'm planning to watch ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" sometime in the future, so I'll try to keep an open mind and won't judge him based on that.<br/><br/>The story started out promising and during most of the movie, I wasn't really interested in the details anyway as I was mesmerised by the action and visuals. However, I would have appreciated it, if when the science behind was being explained, it made more sense. And the ending... I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so suffice it to say, I was dissatisfied.<br/><br/>All in all, if you like sci-fi, action and special effects, this is one of the good ones. 7/10 from me."

","Pacific Rim is one of those movies that doesn't come along often. A big, loud, monster movie. PR borrows heavily from the Godzilla movies. Monsters and giant robots duke it out. The plot is simple enough to work: An underwater 'tunnel' has created a link from the bottom of the ocean to another dimension, that dimension is full of monsters who want to conquer earth because why not? the monsters have apparently done this before throughout the Galaxy so to them it's like riding a bike. The world however, decides to fight back, so they build these giant iron man robots (i mean seriously, they look just like Iron Man)anyway, so these giant robots now have to kill these monsters and destroy the tunnel. In between these events you have some impressive battle scenes. Some battle/fights scene take place off the coast of China, Three-mile island, another one takes place in downtown Tokyo (which is so amazing, i rewound that part of the film to watch again) in the middle of the film is a 20-30 min fight sequence that is just action cgi porn. It was amazing. The special effects are spot on and very realistic. Pacific Rim is now one of my all time favorite movies right up there with Jurassic Park, Cloverfield and War of The Worlds."

","Worldwide Gross 3 weekends $293,361,000. Caught this awesomeness at the IMax @ World Golf Resort just north of St. Augustine:<br/><br/>Unbelievably Incredibly Top Form for Guillermo del Toro. This flick blew my cerebellum thru the roof into the stratosphere. They story made the action scenes mainly concerning the Kaiju & Jaeger, in between scenes we learn that it takes at least 2 human souls in order to pilot a Jaeger so in between the immense action we get very well written characters each having a story I was interested in finding more details about. Well worth the trip to see this in IMax + 3D. The action sequences were shot in native 3d while the interactions and backstory scenes were all done in 2d so this also fits perfectly. Easily and seemingly effortlessly stands tall and above any and all action movies especially in the last 5 years. The effects implementation is characteristically above current top notch as del Toro is known for doing. The story and characters had me wanting more and thinking of how this could set up so many possibilities. The fact that the massive expansive environments which energized the all out action scenes are equally as interesting due to the handling of the characters expansive back stories and emotional facets elevates this wonderful result from the entire film crew involved really testifies to what a well crafted cinematic experience can be and the magic such a passionate creation may invoke.<br/><br/>An adroitly conceived and executed work of cinematic artistic innovation. A new bar has been set and it's made by Jaeger!"
"carantula2010","1","13","19","16 April 2014"," Very expensive snoozefest
","I'm not sure how i finished this movie. But i did, and i want my life time back. I had fun in the first 10 minutes or so, but after that just downhill.<br/><br/>Its a awful movie. Boring and stupid.<br/><br/>There's this character: Mako. She wants to be a Jaeger pilot (or maybe not, she is so strange that is hard to tell). Then the movie goes like this:<br/><br/>Mako: I want to be a pilot. Pentecost: No, you cannot. You taking things too personally. Mako: OK. But can i be a pilot? Pentecost: No. Mako: Please. Pentecost: No. Mako: Please. Pentecost: No way, bi...h! Shut your mouth. (So, a little later) Pentecost: You can be a pilot, i was just kidding. Give me some sugar, girl.<br/><br/>Well, the dialogs wasn't exactly like i described, but wasn't so different either. Believe me, good part of the movie is about Mako wanting to be a pilot (or maybe not) and Pentecost keeping her from it. And then allowing her to be a pilot out of the blue.<br/><br/>Interesting aspect of Pentecost explanation about why Mako shouldn't be a pilot was that she had personal reasons and that would be a problem. Like this aliens are destroying the entire planet, but Mako was the only one with personal issues with that? Strange, right? At that point everyone there should have personal issues with the Kaijus, its just common sense.<br/><br/>There a lot of problemas with every character. And the acting isn't very good as well. The plot was terrible, not even worth to mention.<br/><br/>I was expecting to witness great effects. Well, they're great. But dumb. The Kaijus weren't very convincing, too fast, too flashy, too boring. I started to miss the little Japanese girls inside rubber costumes (way better and more fun to see). <br/><br/>So, the movie is full of flaws. Its boring. Has more defects than i could list. <br/><br/>Sorry my bad English. Its not my main idiom, but i love it."
"chrysoberylz","9","47","83","11 July 2013"," This Makes Godzilla and Transformers Look Bad
","*9 / 10 This first thing that came into my mind when I watched the trailer is that this movie is like Mobile Suit Gundam. Yeah, that anime. Unless that the robot is controlled by two pilots. The robots here are called ""Jaeger"". Then the monsters. Godzilla's friends? Ultraman's new nemesis? They call the monsters ""Kaiju"".<br/><br/>I have great expectation in this movie. Guillermo del Toro is a director with lots of experience and I don't think that this movie will go wrong or mocked by the audience. Not only as director, he also wrote the screenplay! We know that Guillermo del Toro is not just a director, he is also a writer, sometimes as producer, too. We all know that his Hellboy movies are awesome so this Pacific Rim should be entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie's prologue told us about the Kaiju attack all around the world. Then the human race built giant robots to fight the Kaiju to save the world. Then the main characters were introduced one by one. Their past, their characters, and their craziness. The storyline is set in perfect proportion and perfect order. No character's story is too short or too long. We know that Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) is the main character but everyone got their screen time equally.<br/><br/>And, uh, a bit applause for the budget. This awesome movie's budget is ""only"" US $180,000,000! I don't believe that, actually. The special effect is awesome. This is what I call ""Sci-Fi magic""! Awesome shot, and the scene when Gypsy Danger sliced the Kaiju's wings above the Earth's atmosphere was so stunning. I cannot erase that scene from my mind. My gosh that scene was really awesome, and more stunning than any scene in James Cameron's Avatar (2009). That. Scene.<br/><br/>Many said that this movie is quite similar as Transformers. Nope. It's not same at all. Transformers are basically aliens and these Jaegers were artificially made by humans, and had pilots. The concept is like playing Wii or Kinect games, like a simulator. The pilots controlled the Jaegers by moving around and also lots of buttons that I don't understand.<br/><br/>The drama thing in here is also good. The sad moment when Stacker (Idris Elba) said goodbye to Mako (Rinko Kikuchi), also Herc (Max Martini) and Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky)'s last encounter. Those scenes almost bring me to tears. The only hilarious character in this movie is Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman), and Dr. Newton (Charlie Day), maybe. Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) is another extra point to this movie. He's smart but, like typical smart people in movies; he is also stubborn but in the end he could accept another people's opinion.<br/><br/>To conclude all of the things above, this movie is really worth watched. This is not just a gigantic robots movie. The storyline, the action, the special effects, the concept and the execution are balanced one to another. Pacific Rim is the black horse in summer movies so far."
"re12-762-636595","9","24","39","11 August 2013"," It's a great, Fun movie, that's All you really need to know.
","Pacific Rim was easily one of the Movies i was most looking forward to, but i did have mixed feelings about it before seeing, despite the trailers looking really promising, it wouldn't have been the first time i'd have been tricked by pretty visuals from advertising. Immortals, Michel Bays transformers( terrible , simply terrible) and Wrath of the titans would be one of the many examples of this. Anyways, I knew Del Toro was directing Pacific Rim so i was still greatly looking forward to it, considering that many of his movies have been great and well liked by fans( I hate His Hellboy 1 though, i thought it was terrible). After watching it, i can safely say that i absolutely Loved this film, sure i have a few issues with some things but overall this is one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>It's shame really, that the weakest part of the film was the beginning, i remember my friend told me that he stopped watching because he really disliked the way the film had begun, and i unfortunately have to agree. the Thing is, i liked how it opened up , the first few minutes are cool, it gives us the viewer a good background check on what the situation is, but as soon it cuts to the Main character and his Brother, Raleigh and Yancy Becket, it goes down hill. There was supposed to be an emotional spectrum when Yancy dies, but it just doesn't work since i didn't care, honestly, i don't know whether it was trying or not to make me feel sad but it just seemed to rushed. However, The Movie Pick up and has a clean flow as soon as Raleigh comes back to fight More Kaiju Monsters.<br/><br/>Mako In order for you to like this movie, you have to remember that most characters are a bit Generic, is this Bad? No sir not at all. You see somethings are generally accepted as generic because the concept is cool, which is why it's used so often, and in this movie it really works well. I loved the characters here, the performances are top notch and made me care about the characters. The greatest Highlight to me was Mako and Raleigh, their relationship is extremely well handled. Most of the times the ""couple to be!"" end it with a kiss or so, but that doesn't happen here, because it doesn't have to, because you know the connection is there. They had great Khemistry together in fact my favorite scene in the movie was the martial arts fight between mako and Raleigh, yes , even more so than the Jaeger fights. Idris was fantastic as Stacker, he was a great character in the movie, easily delivering a kind yet Very strict soldier who you could both respect and fear.<br/><br/>i am probably one of the few people who didn't mind the Crazy Scientists though, i understand that they were meant to be cartoony, and while at times that was overdone, i still though Charlie day was great and funny in the movie, and i honestly didn't see how he is the 'Jar Jar' of the Pacific Rim. Speaking of the crazy scientists, The comedy was greatly handled in this movie, they knew when to use it, and Unlike iron Man 3, could take a scene seriously without having to worry about it becoming an unnecessary gag. some scenes had me laughing out loud while others made my grab my seat because i was very interested in how the Plot would develop. Moreover, the Plot wasn't a complex one, it was very simple, you know exactly what they have planned to stop the Kaiju attacks from happening, however, Despite that, the movie surprised me because as it unfolded there were some interesting elements that were added to the story that made it much more interesting and complicated. It's Little Tweaks like "" The Attacks are coordinated!"" that make the story shine for me.<br/><br/>There is a Lot of ""Awesome"" in this Pic Right here I can't do a review of this movie without bringing up The fact that the Jaeger Designs were Amazing and extremely cool. Each version has a unique Gimmick the works for the design really well, and i extremely enjoyed seeing them in action against the Kaiju. Speaking of Which, i loved the monsters in this movie, same with the Jaeger each monster had something similar but also something different to make them stand out from one another. and it's Because of this diverse looks and powers that give us the viewers great fighting scenes. Seriously, the action was Top Notch, and unlike Man Of steel( a great Movie Mind you) it wasn't overdone here and it was well balanced among the normal Scenes. Mos Had great action, but at times i wanted to take a break from it, and it made the Final Battle less effective , even though i still loved it.<br/><br/>Overall, Pacific Rim is my favorite Movies this year, which is tough because i've liked a lot of Movies that came out in 2013( The Wolverine, Man of Steel, and yes I enjoyed Iron man 3 too, and i though Mos would have been on top of my list. It was a great film with Over the top action games and characters. This movie i can recommend to everyone, it's really fun and enjoyable and i'm sure 90% of the people would love this movie."
"michaelRokeefe","9","24","39","8 August 2013"," Imagine big...but BIGGER! Eye pleaser!
","Trying not to get too technical, which some reviewers have the right know-how to do that sort of thing...but I was just taken in by the grandeur; F/X to the max. Gigantic monsters and equally big machines to fight them; not just big, but BIG! Enough of that. The amazing Guillermo del Toro directs, helps write and produce this science fiction spectacle. Sometime in the 2020's, the Earth is attacked at various locations by enormous monsters, that have found a super dimensional portal at the bottom of the ocean. The monsters seem to have the same genetics, but no two seem to look alike. And each has its unique method of fighting...each method leaving massive destruction. World wide international scientists and computer wizards/geeks pool knowledge. Gigantic humanoid transformer-like fighters, dubbed Jaegers, are created to fight the attacking monsters called Kaijus. Years come and go; the Kaijus keep coming while the united world forces run through numerous versions of Jaegers, that require two pilots and joined mind-control via a neutral bridge to operate. Cutting to a climax if you will; a brooding, washed-up Jaeger pilot, Raleigh Beckett(Charlie Hunnam)and a rookie, female pilot, Mako(Rinko Kikuchi), are a last hope to take a re-fitted, original Jaeger to the Pacific Rim location of the multi-dimensional, siphon like portal and destroy it to save all humanity. Simple,huh? Fantastic enough to hold your attention for over two hours. Kikuchi has the awesome talent and good looks to short circuit a pacemaker. Others in the cast: Idris Elba, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Diego Klattenhoff and Ron Perlman. You just don't take in PACIFIC RIM...it sucks YOU in!"
"keyos27","10","24","39","30 July 2013"," Mega details transcend the expectations and comparisons
","I rarely write a review by solely narrowing down significant elements that make the movie so special and stand out. But, as ""Pacific Rim"" which is subliminally forced to put in an unexpected competition for reviving childhood memories of those who grew up watching Godzilla or Transformer, when it is merely made to give us an entire new perspective about ""How to defeat Monsters if they really happen to attack earth."" So here it goes, it rocks harder than all the present monstrous movies because <br/><br/>1. There are detailed and logical explanations for the origin of the monsters that let you not only experience immersive and inconceivable scenes but comprehend the story without being perplexed by sloppy settings.<br/><br/>2. Massive details on robots aka Jaegers unleashes the magnificence of their luster, mechanical textures, and operational systems that were created by stunning Visual effects and efforts of stunts.<br/><br/>3. Again, there are tremendous details on monsters aka Kaiju that not only it looks realistic but possesses jagged skin with frightening body structure that can easily threatens even a giant 250-feet tall robot.<br/><br/>4. The movements and actions during the battles are wonderfully depicted without shifting too fast which often results us in confusion for ""Who hits who? or How does it that happen?"" You can vividly enjoy spectacular motions that occur in both city and ocean environments along with dynamic camera angles. <br/><br/>5. Every character play the role with vehement passions. I agree with some of the lines and expressions being quite shallow and cheesy. However, if compared to emotional relationships and conflicts between characters that this film offers, the acting part can be forgiven as no other counterparts have as much scientific explanations and a compelling story as this one. <br/><br/>It is so mega from the intro to the end."
"Rendianami","10","24","39","14 July 2013"," Best Live Action/CGI Film
","I created an account on here solely because of some of the negative reviews that the movie had received in regards to the producer using this movie as his ""personal fanboy playground"". I find it hard to believe that anyone could not enjoy this spectacular movie, and find it disheartening to see that it's beaten in the office box. <br/><br/>I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the theater today. I hadn't really watched the trailers with any particular interest, and the only reason I came to see it was because I'd heard that GLaDOS would be voicing the computers in this. I'd been slumped in my seat, expected to be bored (because of the title), but I was blown away the moment the movie began. I definitely did not expect to see what would carry on throughout the movie, a spectacular sight to behold.<br/><br/>There's such a variety of aliens in terms of design, and it really brought me to the edge of my seat, squealing like a fangirl at all of it. The robots were great as well, bringing with it the fiery love I have for the Transformers movies. The human characters themselves, I came to like as well, despite my resilience for liking any human character in a live action film. I felt for them during scenes, and adored the portrayal that many of the actors/actresses nailed on the spot. They came off to me as people that I could see in real life (namely the two scientists). <br/><br/>I didn't see any lull in the movie whatsoever. I was constantly drawn to the screen with things that I love. I saw/thought of many references throughout the film, which made it more pleasing to watch as I could relate back to those things. It's like a giant conglomeration/fanfiction crossover. Aliens, Transformers, Real Steel (though I haven't actually watched it yet), Evangelion, Godzilla, Hellboy, Portal (this is the most prominent one, and the one that drew me to the movie in the first place), 2012, and much more. I don't see why anyone would give this movie less than an A unless they were asking to be the bad cop in this reviewing scene. <br/><br/>And I'm not stopping at one viewing. I can't wait to see it multiple times, both in normal and 3D, over the next two weeks. It's not a movie that you can see just once. There are so many things to see, and this glorious movie deserves all the attention it can get. <br/><br/>Best live action/CGI movie I've seen since Transformers (I'm talking about the CGI on this one, because I don't care as much for the script). I'd say this is my new favorite movie, and I don't play favorites easily."
"dee.reid","10","25","41","22 July 2013"," The Kaiju shall rise again!
","For ""kaiju-eiga"" (Japanese monster movie) fan-boys, ""Pacific Rim"" has been one of the most eagerly anticipated summer blockbusters for several years now, and for good reason. Due to the passing of legendary special effects artist Ray Harryhausen earlier this year (the film is dedicated to his memory and that of famous Japanese movie director Ishiro Honda - who passed away 20 years ago in 1993), the failure of ""Godzilla"" in 1998, and the reasonable successes of the American found footage/monster flick ""Cloverfield"" in 2008 and South Korea's ""The Host"" in 2006, the monster-on-the-rampage genre has seen some increased relevancy, and legitimacy, in the last decade.<br/><br/>As someone who grew up with, and idolized, Godzilla and other famed Japanese movie monsters - Ishiro Honda's ""Gojira"" (1954), Godzilla's dark, gloomy black & white debut, remains the greatest monster movie ever - ""Pacific Rim"" was the first movie I've seen in the movie theater this year, and it was a choice that was well-worth my hard-earned $7.50. I also belong to a Godzilla fan-boy group on Facebook. Upon the release of ""Pacific Rim"" on July 12, 2013, the page ignited with impassioned fan-boy discussions of what could easily be considered the greatest giant monster movie so far this millennium (if ever, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here - ""Gojira"" is still the best this genre has to offer). I'm inclined to agree.<br/><br/>I greatly admired J.J. Abrams's take on the monster movie genre with ""Cloverfield,"" and I thought that ""The Host"" was a welcome surprise from one of the last places to pop up on the world cinema market. Now with ""Pacific Rim,"" famed Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's big-budget take on the genre (as well as serving as a delightful homage to his childhood fan-boy obsessions in comic books, Godzilla, Japanese Anime', pop culture, and fantasy) has arrived.<br/><br/>Equal parts ""Avatar"" (2009), ""District 9"" (2009), 1998 ""Godzilla,"" Iron Man, ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""Transformers,"" and del Toro's own fervent imagination (together with co-screenwriter Travis Beacham), and featuring an epic score by Ramin Djawadi (which comes close to rivaling the best of the famous Japanese film composer Akira Ifukube), ""Pacific Rim"" begins sometime in the near-future, when mankind is at war with giant, other-worldly sea monsters called ""Kaiju"" (the Japanese word for ""monster"") bent on our destruction. To combat them, we have the Jaegers (the German word for ""hunter""), 250-foot-tall heavily armed, heavily armored giant robots that are piloted by two people who mind meld to form a single unified consciousness - the better to operate them and fight the Kaiju, we're told.<br/><br/>The film's strongest visual appeal comes from the giant monster-robot battles that dominate the film's loudest moments (and pretty much the entire second half of the picture). In today's times, special effects no longer serve to simply enhance movie scenery - as they did in time's past - but essentially to create them. There are some movies in recent years where special effects - namely CGI - are used to create an entire movie and actors seem almost like an after-thought. In recalling the movie, I found it to be a relief that there seems to be a more intricate balance between the battle sequences and the scenes with the flesh & blood human characters.<br/><br/>And we get some truly likable, flesh & blood human characters in the form of a jaded former ace Jaeger pilot named Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who is called back into the line of duty to once again combat the Kaiju threat; also on-board is his former chief, the hard-nosed Stacker Pentecoast (Idris Elba), who lends the movie sex appeal and scenery-chewing military command presence; and lastly, there's the beautiful, ambitious Jaeger pilot-trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi).<br/><br/>Backing them up, is their loyal, wise-cracking systems administrator Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins, Jr.), and a pair of goofy, bumbling Jaeger research scientists - Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) - who make several fundamental discoveries about the Kaiju that may just turn the tide of the war in favor of humanity. And, it'll be impossible to miss him, but del Toro's regular go-to guy Ron Perlman (best known from del Toro's earlier ""Hellboy"" superhero movies and ""Blade II"") also shows up as a leather-skinned, back-alley Hong Kong black marketer named Hannibal Chau.<br/><br/>As a director and screenwriter, del Toro has always given his films rich character and thematic depth, and philosophical complexity (and not to mention a fine sense of humor, which many big-budget blockbusters these days often tend to lack); ""Pacific Rim"" does not rank up there with his most famous picture to date, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (2006), but it's actually much closer to his aforementioned ""Hellboy"" films and ""Blade II"" (2002). It's a blockbuster movie, but one that is not without some degree of humanistic depth and merit. The film's core theme revolves around the benefits of working together - ""two heads are better than one,"" as they say - and this is taken to a somewhat literal degree here, in which empathy (the ability to understand another person's feelings) is seen as a bona-fide superpower in and of itself that is capable of allowing just two people to power towering robots to effectively battle an unspeakable threat to humanity.<br/><br/>It is this purely humanistic touch that takes the spectacle away from the many dazzling special effects-driven action sequences that ""Pacific Rim"" has to offer and instead places it on the human characters at the center of it all. This is something that is purely at the center of much of Guillermo del Toro's best work.<br/><br/>10/10"
"ugyenpeljor","10","26","43","11 July 2013"," Destroy all Monsters!
","It is my sincere hope that this movie proves to be a huge hit, because that will mean we'll get more live-action anime adaptations from Hollywood! Why do I say this? Because Pacific Rim isn't a direct adaption of any one particle anime series, but rather, a homage to the entire genre as a whole. And all of this from the man who brought Hellboy to the big screen, no less! <br/><br/>That said, the Human element in this was a little weak, the romance felt a little forced, and some characters felt too large for life. Case in point, in a movie that features 300ft robots and monsters duking it out and wrecking entire cities in their wake, the only element that felt really too excessive was Charlie Day's performance as the science fellow. The whole effect, ultimately, was the feeling of a comic book, but then again, this is exactly what the director intended, and exactly what we, the viewer, should expect. <br/><br/>As you may have guessed by now, I'm a huge geek for anime, manga, kaiju films, and Japanese culture in general, so this movie was everything I could have wanted, and then some! That is why I encourage you all to check it out! In the mean time, I'll be biding my time until another Japanese monster star makes a well-earned and highly anticipated return to the big screen next year.

"Scene13","8","19","30","31 July 2013"," Monsters, Robots, Scientists and Black Market Dealers
","I didn't know what to expect with this film. I thought it was likely to be a chain of high quality and highly explosive combat scenes linked together by a weak plot. Having thoroughly enjoyed some of Guillermo del Toro previous works (Pans Labrynth, Cronos and Devils Backbone) and knowing of his love for and skill in ""designing?"" Monsters and Insect type characters, I was intrigued to see what he would offer in Pacific Rim. I was not disappointed!<br/><br/>The Good Points<br/><br/>1) Plot: This film had a strong and believable plot line as long as you can get your head around a portal between dimensions, luckily i can. Kaiju pass through a portal between two dimensions and attack Earth. The world unites and design epic transformer like Robots (Jaeger) to fight the Monsters. Some f**king genius has the idea of building a big wall(...idiot) and pull funding from Jaeger projects. Wall fails, the heavily diminished Jaeger project is all that's left to save humanity. whats not to like?<br/><br/>2) Visuals: Overall the graphics in this film were great. Realistic.<br/><br/>3) Robots (Jaeger): The Jaeger were awesome. It was great to see that there were many models of Jaeger and it was developed over time. This helped make them realistic and believable. The Mind Drift control system was clever as well. I thought it was a very original idea.<br/><br/>4) Monsters (Kaiju): I think Guillermo del Toro must have been like a kid in a candy store designing the Kaiju. each one was different. Some adapted for water, Land and even the Air. They had different attacking capabilities, brute force, teeth, spitting acid just to name a view. <br/><br/>5) Humorous Scientists and let's not forget the Dodgy Dealer: Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) a biologist studying the Kaiju. H must have been the only scientist ever to study the Kaiju as he seemed to only be finding out things that were fairly obvious to investigate. It seemed unlikely that he was the first scientist in however long the Kaiju had been attacking the earth to compare two Kaiju DNA samples. Even though perhaps the scientist was a bit slow at finding scientific breakthroughs he did have a good rivalry with Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) a physicist. There rivalry was amusing and was full of light hearted banter i enjoyed the scenes with these characters in. The Black Market ""dodgy dealer"" Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) also provided some light hearted entertainment in the mix of all this devastation. I really liked these three characters possible more than the main characters of the film.<br/><br/>The Bad Points<br/><br/>1) Character Development: I don't need to know the in depth back story of all the characters to route for them to save the world. The back story of the characters was not what this film was about. It felt like the film was trying to force the characters back story down my throat. Probably as a result of undertaking a highly ambitious task of telling this story in 131minutes that the character development seemed weak, rushed and it may have been better if they had just left it out. <br/><br/>2) Love: All i can say is at least it didn't end on a kiss.... i was so convinced it was going too! This is one film where i didn't think they needed to right in the ""love"" it would have been just as good if Rayleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) were just partners/friends.<br/><br/>and if I'mm being really picky:<br/><br/>3) Saving the boat!Really? what about all the demolition caused when there on land!: So in the opening scenes a Kaiju appears and and the Raleigh and his brother Yancy to ""soldiers"" are sent out in the ocean in there Jaeger to exterminate it. They are given strict instructions of what to do and this included leaving a ship of ten fisherman in the water near the fight. They do not listen and help the fisherman out of the way with there Jaeger before attacking the Kaiju. At first i thought "" How considerate and nice to help them out"". Later on in the film there are lots of highly destructive fights on the land and none of the Jaegers, try to assist any stranded people within the buildings and vehicles... this just made the first scene an unrealistic plot device, they would never have risked a in demand and highly expensive Jaeger to save such a few people especially with the added risk it would cause.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is what happens when Maximus Prime and Godzilla have a fun night in the sack! It's awesome, It's epic, It's explosive and yet still realistic. Flowed at a fast pace throughout and thankfully then ending didn't feel rushed! Watch it see what you think!"
"DareDevilKid","9","19","30","25 July 2013"," What Transformers Should Have Been
","Rating: 4/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Not since ""Jurassic Park"" have I had the utmost pleasure of witnessing such a great monster sci-fi mash-up. Like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Them"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", and other classics of the genre, ""Pacific Rim"" too intersperses the plot and back-story succinctly well as the action unfolds. The characters and their journey are given adequate footage as the monsters v/s robots action. More importantly, as the action unfolds, every single shot, each and every sequence is beautifully captured like a ballet reaching its crescendo.<br/><br/>Unlike most gigantic FX laden pseudo sci-fi blockbusters like the ""Transformers"" franchise and ""Iron Man 3"", this films pays immense detail to certain laws of physics and plain simple logic. The action unfolds in a grand spectacle and straps you in for a roller-coaster ride. But it also pays respect to your senses and enables you to minutely follow each aspect of how the fight scenes are choreographed. Wish all gargantuan CGI driven films were like this.<br/><br/>The film stays true to classic monster movies and also to its anime roots. Fans of both, anime and monster movies will be able to detect many subtle references to past classics and popular culture. In the end, ""Pacific Rim"" is summer blockbuster entertainment at its best and you'll be craving for a second viewing once the experience soaks in."
"darkguile86","1","203","403","15 July 2013"," One giant and poorly acted cliché
","In one line: the monster from Cloverfield meets a dumbed down Sons of Anarchy.<br/><br/>The point of this movie is solely a way to show the action scenes, the rest is just pointless and aggravating filler. Tired clichés and one liners make up the majority of the dialog, I found it incredibly aggravating. The acting was simply terrible, bar Ron Perlman whom always fits his roles well. Whilst Charlie Hunman's typecast acting style fits SoA, it doesn't make well on the big screen. He overacts in an aggressive manner to compensate for his lack of all other emotions. It's just a bit too boring and reminds me of the kind of acting you get on TV dramas - look hard and sound always annoyed.<br/><br/>The action scenes were OK, nothing I hadn't seen before in Transformers, although the city destruction scenes were pretty amazing. If the director hadn't gone down the route of cheese and action cliché, but instead taken his job seriously this could have been a semi decent film. If you like giant robots, Japanese style monsters, and are 12 years old or younger go see this movie, (chances are you will still hate it)."

","I enjoyed this movie very much.The plot is well done and the acting very convincing. Special effects very well made. 2 hours of action!! I can't wait for the 2nd part! Great work of Charlie and Rinko, I love Rinko! She is beautiful here and personally I would like she to show some more skin, because she has a great Asian body very wheel toned and athletic. For me, it seems like the movie was well think before its release. Each scene has a purpose and is very enjoyable. I was forgetting the great acting of Idris Elba, an English actor that I respect very much due to his performance in police series and in Prometheus. Excellent choice of actor in any case. Even the doctor, scientific, technicians, etc all they were very well chosen for this movie. I recommend you to see it if you are looking for well entertainment. Congratulation to all the people who made possible this action movie!"

","I wasn't quite sure what to expect after watching the trailer for pacific rim. Was this another transformers? Godzilla MK2? Well, it was actually a pleasant surprise in many many ways.<br/><br/>Narrative: Nothing to fault here. The story line is solid and cuts strait to what's important instead of burying us in years of back-story and needless contextual rubbish. Its a pretty strait forward affair with not may surprises it must be said, but the beauty really does lie in the simplicity with which the story is both crafted and told.<br/><br/>Effects: This is my only gripe. I predominately wanted to see this film for the effects, and don't get me wrong they are utterly beautiful at times, but stylistically, its like someone has taken cyberpunk, steam punk, a little bit of blade runner, star wars and some minority report, scattered all that on a table and picked little bits blindfolded to recycle. There are moments of utter utter genius in the concept design that I think we will see cropping up in many a sci-fi from now on, but as a whole, it has no governing style which visually, i found both confusing and a little annoying...<br/><br/>Cast and characters: Not much to say here really. There's not going to be any Oscar nominations but neither are there any terrible scenes. At times some of the main characters feel a little wooden and under-developed, but in a film predominately based on action, its not a huge issue and anything it lacks it soon makes up for elsewhere.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Its worth your money at the cinema, and judging by the press not many have been parting with hard earned cash to see this, which is a real shame. This film has some real intelligence to it which I think earns it a viewing and better press. Imagine everything you hated about transformers, well this is an antidote. From start to finish it is very entertaining and deals with a disaster scenario in a very refreshing manner. If you going to watch anything besides Elysium, I would suggest this. I've given it seven stars, but if this turns out to be the classic it very well could be, I'd imagine most will be giving it 8."
"Critomaton","7","14","21","11 August 2013"," Monsters vs. The Sons of Metallurgy
","Pacific Rim is a fun movie that's worth seeing in the theater. Its only real flaw is that it leaves you with the feeling that with just a little more effort it could have been a lot more fun.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good, but the film spends more time focusing on the robots than the monsters - I wish the director would have adjusted that balance slightly. The battles are exciting, but it's not a good sign when the penultimate fight is way more thrilling than the final battle. The final monster battle is so muddled that it's hard to tell which monsters, if any, are taking damage, dealing damage, being defeated, etc.<br/><br/>The character underdevelopment in this movie is so conspicuous as to appear deliberate. In fact, it's a good thing Charlie Hunnam already has several seasons of Sons of Anarchy under his belt to prove his acting chops - I doubt if his performance in Pacific Rim will have his agent's phone ringing off the hook. <br/><br/>Idris Elba does a fine job trying to channel drill instructors R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Michael Ironside. But it's a bit of a letdown when we find out that the big, mysterious secret he's protecting is that he is a father figure to Jax Teller's cute Japanese co-pilot. <br/><br/>Although I must admit that good dad/bad son is an interesting alternative to good cop/bad cop, that whole dynamic with the Australian Jaeger pilots was still played out in a very clichéd and unbelievable way. I would have preferred a little less focus on them and a little more dialog from the other Jaeger pilots. <br/><br/>The most well developed characters are also the two most obnoxious: the eccentric scientists. Charlie Day is the Bobcat Goldthwaite for our time, but at least with Bobcat you knew his mannerisms were just schtick. With Charlie Day you're never sure, and that's twice as annoying. I guess the other guy is the Crispin Glover for our time - I have no idea what to think about that. <br/><br/>In the end, a monster movie should be about monsters. There are a few well done snippets of monster fights in the daylight, but the majority of the confrontations take place at night, or during the rain, or underwater, or some combination of the three. For all the realism, it's still often hard to figure out exactly what is going on.<br/><br/>Ironically, even with all the millions of dollars spent on incredibly convincing robot and monster effects, the connection between the Jaeger pilots and their machine looks like a cheap vacuum cleaner hose. That kept making me laugh and taking me out of the moment.<br/><br/>Still, there are just enough plot twists thrown in to keep things interesting - from the black market in Kaiju parts to the risk/reward of ""drifting"" with the Kaiju. At over two hours, this is quite a long movie, but to its credit it doesn't really drag too much. Iron Man 1, 2, and 3 all dragged out their ""time between big action sequences"" as much, if not more, than Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>I'm hoping I'll like this movie even more after a second viewing, just like I did with Hellboy II: The Golden Army. But as with H2:TGA, I can wait for it to come out on cable TV.<br/><br/>I can't remember whether Pacific Rim set itself up for a sequel or not, but I had enough fun watching it that I'd pay to see one."

The visual effect of the movie is also well done. The kaiju seem nice and real.The story line is also well plotted. I feel Rei is alive when i see the role of Mori appears in the movie. The beginning and the ending of the movie is well established. I cant believe that I see Eva goes to the movie and no longer stay in the anime version.

","I wish I could give this movie a lower rating. Everything is terrible, storyline, acting, cgi, everything.. Do not waste your time. I wish I had not. I do not believe there was any forethought into the technical aspects of the movie. Produced in an age of drones and wireless communication, why would there be a need for manual pilots that actually have to run in place driving huge mechanisms to control movement. Why would they 'feel' when the machines arm is ripped off. Why would this fight not be with nuclear weapons instead of trillion dollar bipedal robots. Why would you need to 'drift' two separate minds together to control one. Ever heard of Mechwarrior? Kids play that crap in their basements on a controller with two sticks and six buttons. What a damn waste of time and imagination. I wanted to like it, by the end I just wanted to say I finished it, and now that I have, I want my money back :("

","Poor script, even poorer acting and no sense of direction throughout! The problem with this film is that the characters just aren't believable and you need some credibility to pull off an action yarn like this. For all its faults, 'Cloverfield' held my attention much more than this tired effort. I watched it with my 17 year old son, who gave up on it about 1/3 of the way through. I must confess that I almost followed him as the first half has very little going for it as it tries desperately to make us care about the characters (and little else). The two scientists are the least believable of all and I got seriously annoyed with the both of them! It picks up a little in the second half but not enough to pull you back in. All in all, a tired, boring, noisy mess. I'm amazed that the film is so highly rated by others here. Oh, I almost forgot; the CGI is passable but only just. It's destined to be forgotten!"

I fell asleep about half way through and had to see part two the following day.<br/><br/>As far as I can make out this is about giant sea monsters vs transformers. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman play the gravediggers from Hamlet, badly. The two stars of Sons of Anarchy prove that they can't act their way out of a paper bag.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Idris Elba puts in an embarrassingly bad performance ( Imagine the key speech from Gladiator written and delivered by Worzel Gummidge.) Action has been replaced by acres of CGI that might satisfy an eight year old but will fail to impress sentient beings evolved beyond the level of igneous rocks.<br/><br/>The only redeeming feature of this film is that it is, at least, better than the pretentious and unoriginal nonsense that was Pan's Labyrinth."

","After the intriguing Pan's Labyrinth, we were, perhaps, entitled to expect something with a little more brains from Guillermo del Toro. Well, Pacific Rim sadly isn't it. It isn't bad as blockbusters go (and I should admit I, for one, am usually underwhelmed by blockbusters, even ones which are better than this), but it falls down in areas where a film should be strong whatever genre it is and whatever demographic it serves (in the case of Pacific Rim I suspect that is 11-year-old boys).<br/><br/>The characters struggle even to be two-dimensional, the 'plot' and it's explanation is a tad too simplistic even for a blockbuster, the dialogue is horribly predictable and the 'fight' scenes all go on just a little too long. In a way it's as though del Toro got a Build Your Own Blockbuster kit for Christmas and put it all together without really consulting the manual. I, for one, wanted to know more about the Kaju, the monsters from deep who are destroying the world. What were they? Where did they come from? Did they agree with Obamacare or did they (rather more probably given how fierce and unremitting they were to destroy all before them) incline more to the Tea Party? That kind of thing.<br/><br/>Then there were the jaegers, the monstrously large robots humankind had developed to kill them: how come, for example, they didn't leak when under water? How were they powered? How come, what with all the technology we had at our disposal to design and build them in the first place, the best they can resort to when destroying a kaju is a heavy bout of fisticuffs and knocking six bells out of their kaju opponent? The problem with Pacific Rim is that del Toro comes up with some neat ideas, but then explores the wrong parts of them.<br/><br/>Being a sci-fi offering, it is reasonably easy to buy into the notion that each jaeger has to be operated by two folk in tandem who have to 'share' their brains and memories. Hogwash, yes, but what they hell. But apart from telling us that that's the deal, del Toro doesn't bother developing the notion, which might well have offered fertile ground for invention. Where Pacific Rim does score is in special effects: they are very well done, though - back to griping mode - once you have seen one city obliterated by a kaju stomping through it, the wonder of it all does tend to fade rather quickly.<br/><br/>I can't think director del Toro had much to do with bringing about the special effects other than writing his brief ('I want monsters that look like reptilian dinosaurs, but which emit an eery blue light from their throats. By Friday. Oh, and they must be Republican supporters or the young shavers watching this film just won't be persuaded') so whoever operated the PCs for the CGI and designed it all should get a cheer or two. But a film needs more than just neat CGI.<br/><br/>The characters: the grizzled, dedicated leader who gives his life for mankind (Idris Elba), the pretty female aide who demonstrates she's as good as any boy (Rinko Kikuchi), Our Hero (Charlie Hunnam), the Oz father and son team (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky), the obligatory faux comedy double-act (Burn Gornam and Charlie Day) and a - very underused - criminal mastermind (Ron Perlman) have about as much life about them as your average stock comic book protagonist, but the actors say the corny lines they are given, always find their marks and generally don't disgrace themselves, even if none is a contender for this year's Oscars. All, I'm sure, would cope with more demanding material without any bother at all.<br/><br/>So there you have it. If you like hamburgers, this most certainly looks the part of a hamburger and then some. If you actually want it to taste of hamburger, save Pacific Rim for another day. At the time of writing IMDb users have given this an average 7.4/10. Don't be fooled. I've seen a lot better, despite the CGI."
"ilikeimdb","2","7","9","7 January 2014"," Better or Worse Than Sharknado?
","The similarities between Pacific Rim and Sharknado go far beyond their lithe, telegenic screenplays and nuanced character-driven plots. Practically Shakespearean in their world-views and intricate family dynamics, both movies will keep you on the edge of your seat as plot twists have you guessing right up until the end on the big ""who done it"" question. Oh certainly, first-rate special effects added to well-crafted acting with so many layers of emotional depth you'd think its respective sea creatures were pipe-lined straight from Citizen Kane, or perhaps The Godfather, or maybe a bit of both. Really, who's to say which picture will garner the most Golden Globes or Academy Awards this year. My bet's on ILM's splendorous work in Pacific Rim although I've got to say Sharknado's sharks really projected tremendous amounts of fear-inducing horror that weren't quite the equal of the more anime-inflected denizens of Pacific Rim. I suggest you see both films in a double feature and decide for yourself."
"alia-s","3","7","9","7 January 2014"," Disappointing
","Unfortunately I expected too much from this movie. Main reasons for my disappointment: The characters are too simple and easily psyched especially when it comes to the two professors (Dr. Newton Geiszler & Gottlieb). The enduring fights between them are flat and listless and become very tiring during the movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion many of the actors could do a lot better. Best examples are Ron Perlman or Idris Elba who we know for better acting. Their roles are not deep enough for high performance acting anyway.<br/><br/>The Story is weak and very predictable. There are too few surprises and no suspense at all. Good example is the story of Mako Mori. Viewers easily know what is going to happen and what her part in the movie will be.<br/><br/>From my point of view they just stringed many special effects together to distract from the simpleminded storyboard. In total the movie seems to me like a cheap copy of transformers mixed with a cheap copy of Godzilla.<br/><br/>I would not recommend it at all."
"philip-macd","2","7","9","26 December 2013"," Incredibly underwhelming, even for an action blockbuster
","Let me preface this review a little bit so hopefully this review can help people out in determining if the film is worthy of a watch based on their preferences (I say no for me). I love all types of movies--on the one hand I like movies that really make me think, but on the other hand, I find enjoyment in movies where I can shut my brain off and just enjoy some good action (Transformers, Battleship, Fast and Furious, etc.) I never go into movies like that expecting some masterpiece of a story and acting, but at least it's enough to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>That being said, I thought Pacific Rim was awful, the only redeeming quality of which was the CG. The acting and story was so poor, in my opinion, that it really set some new lows for me in my book, and failed to keep me entertained. If you're looking for some mind-numbing sci-fi action, I really would advise AGAINST watching this movie. I was able to enjoy stuff like Independence Day, Cloverfield, Battleship, and Transformers. Pacific Rim on the other hand, really just failed to excite me in any way what-so-ever. I'm a little upset that it received a 7.1/10 on IMDb, because I think that is FAR too generous for what it delivers."

","*May contain some spoilers*<br/><br/>I've read a couple of other reviews so far and they all have seemed to hit the nail on the head with them so I'm only going over a few scenes. Don't get my wrong I enjoyed the movie and thought that it was better then what I was expecting but I have a few annoyances with some scenes which I'll be talking about.<br/><br/>The first scene I'm talking about is the one where there are two Kaijuas *monsters* in the coast of Hong Kong. They send out three Jeagers *robots* to destroy them leaving one behind. After a few minutes of fighting two Jeagers have been destroyed and only one Kaijua is somewhat hurt. The larger Kaihua that resembles a gorilla uses some king of EMP to shut down the remaining Jeagers and all electronics in the loading bay. But the city which is much close is not affected by the blast as all the lights remain working. And while the remaining Jeager stands in the water unable to move the Kaijua just paces around it at only point being able to attack it without being attacked back while the other Kaijua goes off into the city to find the researcher that drifted with one of there minds. <br/><br/>A bunch of stuff happens and the gorilla Kaijua is killed while the other one in the city turns out to have the ability to fly. Which made me wonder why he didn't fly the second he got into the sea as it would have been far quicker. It get's into a battle with a Jeager that comes from the loading bay that is an original Mark 1 so it is analog meaning it was affected by the EMP. The Kaijua takes it above the clouds into the stratosphere and the Jeagers pulls out a sword and cuts it through and through then falls to the earth which also makes me wonder why the hell they didn't use it on the gorilla guy as it seems far more effective then the plasma cannon. <br/><br/>There is another scene towards the end with a Kaijua that is the same way could have been finished far quicker if they just all had swords but I'm not going into to detail about that. <br/><br/>Again allow me to stress this I enjoyed the movie but if you think about some scenes like that it can put you in a sour mood and then that's all you'll see further in scenes that could have been ended a lot quicker but were dragged out for the sake of filling time. Anyway in the end I gave this movie a eight out of ten."
"jdkraus","8","21","34","1 August 2013"," Kaijus versus Jaegars...Guillermo Del Toro's big budget dream
","A friend of mine described this feature as being so corny that it is enjoyable. He is not the only one who thinks this. Director and writer Guillermo Del Toro was not trying to accomplish anything inventive or groundbreaking with this movie--like with ""Blade 2"" and the ""Hellboys"" he was going for pure entertainment. In this arena, ""Pacific Rim"" excels. It is jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring to watch on the big screen with deafening surround sound and beautiful visual effects that should steal the golden statue. <br/><br/>The plot is simple and basic. Monsters have come to invade from another world and humanity has to defeat them before the planet is obliterated. The monsters are known as Kaiju (Japanese word for monster) and the machines that the humans have built to fight them are called Jaegars (in German means hunter). Combined with a ten minute intro by the main character, which brilliantly sets up the story without being too technical and daunting, followed by a remaining plot that progresses without boredom makes what could have been a dull cliché intriguing. <br/><br/>The characters at first glance seem to be the generic types in this type of a movie. A hero who lost his brother to the monsters (Hunnam). A quiet, modest Japanese girl who wants revenge (Kikuchi). An aging badass leader who is the glue that keeps the company going (Idris Elba). A couple of quirky scientists (Day and Gorman). And even a dog and a slimy black market dealer (Perlman). But as the movie charges forward, such common characters are forgivable for all the actors make their performances their own without being overly emotional or wooden. They manage to make the audience laugh and we have the tendency to cheer them on as they kick the Kaijus' asses. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Pacific Rim"" marks as a great fun movie, even if it is about man machines beating giant reptiles to a pulp with their bare hands. Visually stunning. Meant for the big screen. Go see it before it goes into the DVD and Blu-Ray shelves at Walmart."

"OleFr-Skj","8","15","23","14 August 2013"," Pacific Rim defies expectations
","In 2013, humanity comes under attack by giant alien behemoths known as ""Kaiju"", emerging from a portal deep beneath the pacific ocean, costing millions of lives. After the world pools its resources together, the Jaeger program is created as a defense against the Kaiju. The ""Jaegers"" are powerful mech warriors, each piloted by a crew of two pilots, who have their minds connected to function as one with the Jaeger.<br/><br/>Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), is one such pilot. Who lands in a slump after losing his older brother to a Kaiju. Several years later, with the Jaegers' efficiency and numbers diminishing and the Kaiju advancing, Raleigh is brought in to pilot his old mech, Gypsy Danger, as part of a last-ditch effort to end the war once and for all.<br/><br/>I went into Pacific Rim having very little prior knowledge of the film. I didn't recognize a single actor, nor had I ever seen any of del Toro's movies before. All I expected to see was giant robots punching sea monsters, hopefully with enough intelligence and conviction to warrant my investment. And while the movie did indeed deliver precisely that, the way it went about it turned out to be a delightful surprise.<br/><br/>What I'm specifically talking about is the setting and story. From the trailers I expected the movie to chronicle the origins of the Jaeger program and humanity's stand against the Kaiju. Instead we get a quite smaller scope, with only four Jaegers appearing throughout the film (two of which get very little screen time). To be quite frank, I was actually expecting an army of Jaegers.<br/><br/>I actually liked this more compressed setting. Because even though it's still huge, it's also different, but in a good way. The smaller scope allows more room for character and, dare I say it, humanity to come into the film, and Guillermo del Toro does not let any of it go to waste.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, I was seriously bummed that half of the Jaegers were destroyed so quickly. They both looked really cool, and then they were just there for about ten minutes. For example: the three-armed red Jaeger, Crimson Typhoon, was defeated embarrassingly quickly, and it was by far the coolest looking one, too.<br/><br/>I also had a few issues with the pacing. The movie opens with a long- winded narrative which, while it does clearly spell out for you what's happened and what the stakes are, I can't help but feel like there was an entire extra movie that was simply tucked away in there, for little to no reason.<br/><br/>I also noticed was that there were a few instances where the CGI effects got a little overblown, especially during the film's climax. Luckily, these moments were few and far between.<br/><br/>Finally, I found the ending to be a little bit too cheesy for my taste. It's not a huge problem, it just bugged me a little<br/><br/>But with that said, there's just so much to love about Pacific Rim. Probably one of my favorite things was that a lot of the generic action blockbuster tropes show up in the movie, only to be either resolved quickly or taken in an unexpected direction. My personal favorite example is the rivalry between Raleigh and Chuck (one of Striker's pilots). They run afoul of each other because Chuck sees Raleigh as a has-been, and doesn't want him dragging everyone else down, Raleigh in turn is ticked off by Chuck's acting like a spoiled child and in general just being a massive dick. It's a typical machismo rivalry and I was expecting to hate Chuck up until the climax where he'd ""redeem"" himself. <br/><br/>Not here. The rivalry is quickly resolved when Gypsy saves Striker from a double Kaiju assault, proving that Raleigh's still got it. Over and done with, bravo.<br/><br/>The cast is all-around very competent, and receive enough character for us to actually root for them and wish for their victory. There is a genuine sense of danger when the Jaegers engage the Kaiju, and I did actually fear for their lives on multiple occasions. Again; bravo.<br/><br/>The action scenes are absolutely superb, both well choreographed and visually stunning. They manage to convey a sense of fun that is sorely lacking in entertainment nowadays.<br/><br/>The Kaiju are extraordinarily terrifying, I was actually a bit frightened by them, which I was also very impressed by. This adds to the element of danger and risk for the characters.<br/><br/>In the end, Pacific Rim is big, exciting, thrilling and ultimately just plain fun."

","Good choice of actors (for the most part). Excellent soundtrack and sound effects. Astonishing visual effects. Mindblowing action scenes. A hell of a plot, and a little bit of humor make 'Pacific Rim' a more than good film. But it's just a few little details that keep it from being a truly great film, and these are:<br/><br/>-Do the two scientists need to act so stupid? They contribute enormously to the thickening of the plot and to the ultimate triumph of humanity over the kaiju, but they're over acting too much in my opinion and they act to be super nerds too much.<br/><br/>-If the Russians and the three oriental rangers are so damn good, why are they killed in the first fight they participate in? They clearly weren't going to make it until the end of the film, but if they're portrayed as living legends in the war against the sea monsters, then I felt that they should have won at least one fight each, even if it was a thirty second on screen fight to give their deaths more meaning as to what our heroes where up against.<br/><br/>-The ending, why was it so predicable? You could see that Raleigh and Mako were going to live. It would have been so much more moving if Raleigh evacuated Mako from the jaegger and sacrificed himself to save humanity. It would have given the film and tremendous ending.<br/><br/>-When Ron Perlman's character cuts his way out of the baby kaiju that swallow him, isn't it a copy of Tommy Lee Jones's character blasting his way out of the bad guys guts in Men In Black? It was funny, though.<br/><br/>Even with all this said, it's a really enjoyable movie and I recommend it to anybody who likes action and epic stories. I give it an 8 out of 10."

The battles are hard-hitting and you really get the sense that these are massive, massive beings that are just larger than life.

Hopefully, in the future, we get to see a sequel! If you are looking for a good time, ignore the fools who went in expecting for a killer story and a killer script. It just ain't there.

"HideousHades-753-960378","9","15","23","3 August 2013"," Brilliantly Executed
","When I first heard of Pacific Rim, I wasn't expecting much. A film about gigantic robots fighting enormous aliens? An apocalypse that must be ""cancelled""? When I entered the theatre, I prepared myself for a generic over-the-top, badly-executed blockbuster, loosely based on the Transformers franchise. Fortunately for my brain cells, this wasn't the case. <br/><br/>When a film is executed properly, viewers are allowed to forget any plot weaknesses and just enjoy the film. Certain films are easier to pull off than others, depending on the complexity, originality, and strength of the plot. A film about an imminent alien invasion and a resistance of gigantic robots is certainly difficult to pull off, but Guillermo del Toro dismissed this disadvantage and executed Pacific Rim perfectly. The writing was quite decent, the costume and set designs were brilliant, the special effects were incredible, and the acting was a cut above blockbuster standards. Not to mention the pacing, which was perfect and kept me captivated throughout. Because of this, the generic plot was easy to overlook. <br/><br/>Despite the mediocre plot, many clichés were purposefully cast aside. For example, in one scene, Raleigh Becket (Hunnam) says ""let's check for a pulse"" and incinerates a monster that could have been alive. A cliché that I see in many action films is the following: an enemy rises up and attacks the main character from behind after the main character thinks that it is dead. However, Del Toro skillfully avoided this tiresome cliché, and added some comic relief in the process. Pacific Rim didn't contain much of a romance subplot, either, and Raleigh Becket's partner (Rinko Kakuchi) wasn't portrayed as a beauty model (a ridiculous archetype that I hate). <br/><br/>At first glance, one might think that Pacific Rim has no underlying theme. It could be considered a film featuring nothing more than mindless violence, and completely centred around robots fighting aliens. While this is true to a certain extent, cooperation was a large part of Pacific Rim - two pilots in each robot, thousands of scientists and engineers collaborating with each other, and hundreds of nations pooling their resources to build the Jaegers. Pacific Rim stands out among many other blockbusters as a film which actually tried to contain a message. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Del Toro executed Pacific Rim brilliantly. Some of the casting was great, including Idris Elba as Stacker Pentacost, and Rinko Kakuchi as Mako Mori. The music, special effects and pacing are so incredible that you'll have no trouble overlooking the plot's mediocrity. I would give Pacific Rim a rating of 9.3/10, with points taken off for a weak plot, some mediocre performances, and a few lame lines here and there. However, there are plenty of redeeming factors, and the film is entertaining to boot. If you're worried because this film looks like Transformers, you're making a huge mistake. Watch it yourself - you won't be disappointed!<br/><br/>-Neo Stark"
"johnnymacbest","8","15","23","27 July 2013"," Great film.
","One of the best films I've seen this year. A unique blend of Japanese mecha and kaiju that pays homage to those films, Pacific Rim is a film that not only dazzles the senses, but it's also a human story at heart and that's the most important part of any film that has the fate of the world hanging in the balance with epic battles at the forefront. I found this film MUCH BETTER than the Transformers films. Though those films had epic action scenes, the big difference is that you can ACTUALLY see the action; no quick-style-MTV-ADD-riddled editing. The action flows organically along with the story, which is both exciting, fresh, and well-acted. Some of the characters were underdeveloped, but the leads are impressive with great performances throughout.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is one of those films that simply make you say, WOW!!! A really fun time at the movies and a nice change of pace from the gritty blockbusters in theaters now. I hope they get a sequel going because I'm really excited to see what their gonna come up with next."

The comments made by people around me always start with ""horrible story"" and end up with ""perfect special effects though"". Truth to be told, I can totally foresee that, for nearly all action movies follow this trend. But I was wrong. There is no single twist surprising and the actress really can't act! What's wrong with her face?! She does not know how to smile, does she? Then the robots. Come on. These huge machines are unable to leave deep impression on audience. The fighting scenes are of great chaos-sea water, buildings, robots and monsters mix with each other so that I could only tell that something is moving in the screen. The finale eventually adds the last awful stroke. The only thing of this movie worth keeping is the theme song, boosting work efficiency."
"arthur_goeldner","9","40","71","11 July 2013"," An homage to the classics.
","If you enjoy seeing giant robots battle enormous monsters from another dimension in stunning 3D you will absolutely love Pacific Rim. With its theme of world-wide devastation from a seemingly unstoppable invasion of colossal beasts, the fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of Jaeger pilots - individuals who jointly control and pilot gigantic robots. <br/><br/>A rift in dimensions has opened between dimensions in the pacific, known as the Breach, where giant monsters named Kaiju emerge to ravage the sea-side. Over the next five years war takes its toll on humanity and in response to this grave threat all the worlds' governments pour all their resources into finding a way to stop them from destroying the world. Jaegars are created, enormous twin-manned robots with the power to fight and kill these mysterious alien giants. As the frequency of these attacks increase and the resources of the Jaegar programs funds slowly diminish, a final answer must be found in order to save humanity from a seemingly devastating end.<br/><br/>What really got to me was the mood of the film. There is a general sense of doom and finality to the encroaching, and ever escalating frequency of attacks from the beasts, which are referred to as ""Kaiju"", a Japanese word which literally translates to ""strange beast."" Famous Kaiju from cinema history include ""Godzilla"", ""Mothra"" and the enormous turtle-like monster ""Gamera."" Fans of these types of films are in for a treat.<br/><br/>While some might criticize the film for being unrealistic in its plot, you have to remember that these kinds of films are never to be taken seriously. The drama involved in Pacific Rim, I felt, was handled with subtlety, with the usual tropes that come with action films of this caliber. So expect to see rivalries, old warhorses, a badass bookworm played by Charlie Day, and of course the battle couple played by Charlie Hunnam and Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi. Of course the actor who really steals the show is the star of BBC's Luther, Idris Elba, who plays Stacker Pentecost - Director and driving force behind the Jaegar program. A man with a seemingly impossible task ahead of him, he must remain strong for the sake of the pilots under his care and supervision.<br/><br/>A generally fun and engaging action film with plenty of amazing visual effects. The designs of the aliens leave one in awe of their sheer scale and destructive power. The immense size of both the robots and aliens is felt as you can really sense how heavy they would be. The animators really did a splendid job on this film. I can appreciate this film from a technical standpoint alone. <br/><br/>Legendary Pictures have outdone themselves and produced an original film outside of their usual comfort zone i.e. superhero films. We can look forward to Legendary building on their giant monster film experience with ""Godzilla"" set to release in 2014 through Warner Bros. Entertainment, after which Legendary are rumored to be signing a new contract with Universal Pictures - with the expiration of their Warner Bros. contract at the end of 2014."

The last 2 years of Summer Blockbusters has made me look at the justification of these films - I conclude that we could actual survive without them and instead of using these mega budgets on mega let downs - just give the cash to some charity that needs it - surely that will give us all something to remember unlike 'Pacific Rim'..........."

"DubhDoo","9","19","31","11 August 2013"," 'Pacific Rim' does what it promises with a great sense of fun
","At first glance, 'Pacific Rim' may seem like Guillermo Del Toro selling out – it's his first blockbuster with a budget shy of $200 million, featuring giant robot battles. However, this film is no sell-out; it is clearly a Guillermo Del Toro movie, maybe not as much as 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'Hellboy' were, but a Guillermo Del Toro movie nonetheless. It is possibly his most personal – he said one of the reasons he made was ""to reconnect with his inner eleven year old"", being inspired by all the Kaiju movies he marvelled as a child.<br/><br/>The film opens with a narration by the protagonist, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) chronicling how giant monsters (Kaijus) emerged from a portal in the Pacific Ocean and began to destroy cities. In response, mankind developed giant robots (called Jaegers) piloted by two people to destroy them. Now, with the threat worse then ever, Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) calls Raleigh back into action so that they can ""cancel the apocalypse"".<br/><br/>'Pacific Rim' might not be as deep or nuanced as some of Del Toro's previous work, but as a giant monster movie it's faultless. You want giant robots hitting giant monsters? You got it. The action sequences here are some of, if not the best, the Mexican filmmaker has directed, they're easy to follow, beautifully staged, exciting and most importantly, great fun to watch. When hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, pummelled a Kaiju with a large ship, I couldn't help but smile. And that's one of the best things about the movie – it is pure fun from start to finish, making a nice change from the dark, brooding blockbusters that are around today. It has a light tone with some silly humour (courtesy of the zany scientist duo) and a lovely cameo from Del Toro regular Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau (continuing the film's line of brilliantly-named characters).<br/><br/>Sure, you could criticise the film for having one-dimensional characters, clunky dialogue and a thin plot, but when said film is so exuberantly fun, these things don't matter one bit. I was always engaged with the characters, rooting for them as they battled the Kaiju, despite the fact that they weren't exactly original creations. This is undoubtedly helped by the fact that performances are solid all-around, particularly Idris Elba who makes the often cheesy 'call-to-arms-speech' rousing. As pure entertainment, this is one of the best films of the year so far, it's a Kaiju movie that also looks and feels like a live- action anime film. Robots vs. monsters? 'Pacific Rim' does what it says on the tin and frankly, that's enough."
"Left_Hand_of_Dog","8","19","31","9 August 2013"," Crafting the Apocalypse
","In a cinematic age ruled with an iron monetary fist by soulless, cynical blockbusters, it's increasingly rare to find a high-budget film, particularly one within the realm of fantasy/action, that recalls so wonderfully the spirit of old Hollywood. By this I mean the conjuration of palpable sensations of excitement and wonder, gleefully giddy in its adherence to vision and imagination. It may sound odd to lavish these desirable attributes on a film that is ostensibly about robots and monsters punching each other, but such is the quality of Pacific Rim, a fantastically fun mecha-anime influenced apocalypse film from the ever-creative Guillermo del Toro, most notable for other imaginative adventures such as Hellboy and, my personal favorite, Pan's Labyrinth.<br/><br/>In a decidedly Lovecraftian fashion, enormous monsters (known as Kaiju) have invaded the earth through a portal in the sea. As the attacks escalate in both chronological intervals and devastating scope, humanity forms the Jaeger project, in which megalithic robots are built to combat the looming threat. Each is piloted by two drivers, whose minds must meld to properly control these behemoths, and thus our stage is set for some properly awesome destruction. It's the execution of these battles, both in terms of sheer visual extravagance (monster movie mavens take note!) and more fundamental stylistic choices (the anime inspired designs, the slow, heavy kinetics of the combat) that shine most brightly in Pacific Rim, and will instantly capture the heart of anyone still maintaining a sense of wonder in these dark days. Unfortunately, the same level of praise cannot be fully hoisted onto some of the film's more flagging dramatics, but some scripting and casting issues do little to diminish the palpable pugilistic fun inherent to this uniquely imaginative popcorner.<br/><br/>While the monsters and mechs are thoroughly marvelous, minor problems arise when we take a look at some of the more human elements. While there are a number of exceptionally well-cast roles (Idris Elba as the rough-neck commander, Charlie Day as well, Charlie Day in typically fun comedic relief fashion, and especially Ron Perlman as an underground cartel kingpin and purveyor of Kaiju parts, among others), I took issue with some of the lead choices. Charlie Hunnam is serviceable, if unspectacular as our quintessential handsome white male hero Raleigh Becket, and Robert Kazinsky, his chief rival and fellow Jaeger pilot, not only looks remarkably similar, but their flights of alpha-male bro-down tough guy head-butting did absolutely nothing for me. The running sub-plots of Kazinsky and his father (played by Max Martini) having a somewhat strained relationship, and Raleigh and Rinko (his co-pilot, following his brothers demise by Kaiju claw) learning to work together, feel somewhat lacking in suitably deep dramatic arcs, and the excitement begins to wane when the film chooses to focus on these elements for some of the more extended, Kaiju-less segments.<br/><br/>That being said, there's a refreshing degree of simplicity and honesty to the script and execution as a whole, and this charm is evident even when the dramatics feel mildly stale. There's no cynicism on display here whatsoever, and the overtly traditional scripting is what lends a permeable charm to what, in other hands, could have been disastrous. Going back to the comparison to old Hollywood, it's this straightforward approach to human dynamics, a simple story told well, replete with a degree of ingratiating corniness and the awesomely entertaining (and well-choreographed) action, that makes Pacific Rim work so completely. Petty niggles aside, the film simply radiates fun, and this consistency in spirit and tone make these other asides essentially pointless. After all, anyone interested in this movie is going based on the idealization of giant mechs and monsters duking it out on an epic scale, and it does not disappoint. It may not purvey the mystical gravity or unforgettable characterizations of the peerless Pan's Labyrinth, but Pacific Rim is a summer blockbuster done gloriously right. A win for del Toro, a win for the art of imaginative film-making, and a win for us. Don't miss it.<br/><br/>-Jester Kay (aka Left Hand of Dog) cinemalevolent.blogspot.com"
"fligite3","8","19","31","24 July 2013"," Brilliant homage to the kaiju and mecha genres, though lacking in some departments.
","Cheesy, clichéd dialogue; bland, generic characters; bad acting on the parts of the lead Charlie Hunnam and supporting actor Idris Elba(the role would've been perfect for Samuel L. Jackson, like seriously); and a fairly predictable plot where gaps of logic abound; however, the movie is astounding when it's being what it's meant to be: an homage to Japanese Kaiju(think Godzilla) and giant mech films. While obviously a loving tribute to these genres by director Guillermo del Toro, it manages to be incredibly original with none of the monsters or mechs being clearly derived from any creations I've seen in the genres before(and each one having incredible and distinct designs, particularly on the part of the of the Jaegers). The action scenes are, as you can expect from a summer blockbuster, the main draw and are absolutely spectacular. Michael Bay, take notes, this is how you handle giant robot fights; not meaningless heaps of metal flying confusingly throughout the scene, but crisp, clear shots of brilliantly designed badass robots doing badass robot things. The monsters get plenty of credit here too, as they were absolutely spectacularly done. If you're looking for awe-inspiring, get-your-blood-pumping, edge-of-your-seat, hyphen-hyphen-hyphen, action, this is the movie for you. I will say, the few interesting characters got far too little screen time. Both Charlie Day and Ron Perlman had fantastic performances and I wish the two had more interactions, but it is what it is. Worst character award goes to Burn Gorman's character, but his portrayal his decent enough. Beyond the basic premise of ""Monsters attack earth, we build giant robots to fight them,"" the plot is fairly lacking. Some good character back story, and, again, Perlman and Day's subplot is absolutely lovely, but overall its predictable, uninspired, and has too many holes for my taste. But, again, the plot is second to the homage and action in this film, which is where the film truly does shine. Overall, I would strongly advise seeing this film."

Indeed, this movie glorifies the monster movie genre; it takes it to a higher, more sublime, level. Here the director lets out all the stops and lets the debris settle where it may. The movie conveys a positive message. It is about teamwork and about how humans are able to unite to solve problems. The monsters themselves are not especially surprising. Similar types can be found in many other monster movies. But what is different is how they are treated by the humans and how the humans respond to them. Unlike other monster movies which show humans in mass panic mode, this movie portrays humans as being stalwart and in control. You know they will beat the monsters; it's just a question of how.

For once, I loved that a film has eye- popping visuals, explosions and action--and it manages to deliver an entertaining experience without leaving you feeling dumb for having enjoyed it--a problem too often associated with movie of this style. Well worth your time."
"Rickting","4","5","6","30 November 2014"," Style over substance and not in a good way
","Robots hit monsters. Am I meant to care? Guillermo del Toro's latest project involves humans controlling enormous robots and beating up Godzilla style monsters emerging from the ocean. It's very satisfying that this didn't actually do that well in America, because this is just total formula. We don't need movies like this. We've seen it all before. This action garbage has silver linings here and there. Visually, it's interesting and has plenty of awesome imagery. It's got a strong colour palette. Del Toro's direction is merely acceptable, but there is a sense of wonder in the movie, and the CGI genuinely looks great. In terms of style and visuals, the movie is quite strong and not everything can be deep and meaningful. Many will enjoy this, especially if they see it on a big screen. Pacific Rim frequently feels like a loving tribute to its genre and for some it will be a dream come true. At least it's a bit lighter and less serious than some other blockbusters these days. For some this could be a good antidote to Man Of Steel.<br/><br/>I saw this on the small screen so maybe I'm biased. The thing which lets PR down is that it's not just robots hitting monsters. There is an hour between the first and second big robot battles and the film has the cheek to try and emotionally engage us with these pathetic, one dimensional characters. Seriously? The film may look great, but it's so cartoony and flat (While pretending it isn't flat by shoving loads of meaningless backstory down our throats) it's could have been some awful 2 hour cartoon on CBBC. The acting is pretty bad and even Idris Elba isn't that good. The movie just isn't original and since it's actually pretty boring much of the time (I don't care about what happened to the female protagonist when she was a kid!). Del Toro, who also made Pan's Labyrinth, another very overpraised film, is clearly popular because he's a bit different. Difference in modern films is a great things but there's only so long I can look at creatures, dark fantasy and loads of boring weirdness before I give up and watch Godzilla instead.<br/><br/>4/10"
"AlsExGal","3","5","6","28 September 2014"," Did we all watch the same movie.....
","... or do I just have standards? Someone in the comment section said ""Is this the most stupid movie ever or what ...highly advanced alien civilization trying to invade earth using giant creatures that are cloned??? or give birth??? and much more stupid humans using giant robots to wrestle them""... and then he goes on to give some options and ask why it was done this way. I'll tell you why, original poster, because it is one way to get alien invaders, giant cloned creatures, and giant robots all into the same movie. This - and all big budget action pictures made today - are not about American audiences. They are about overseas audiences, where 75% of the money is made. Specifically, China and Russia. Thus you have minimal dialogue, big explosions, buxom scantily clad females, and muscular macho men who look like they came straight out of a porn movie with break-away clothing.<br/><br/>How minimal is the dialogue? Well my husband watched this with one earphone on so he could hear the film, and one off so he could listen to me parodying the dialogue MST3K style by what I thought was going on just by the muted overacting. He stopped the film and took off the other headphone after awhile and said - ""to not be hearing anything that's being said you are remarkably spot on"". And this is exactly what the filmmakers are going for - something that you do not need to be an English speaker to follow.<br/><br/>I did watch it later with dialogue or else I would not be able to write this review in good faith. I'm giving this a three just based on the work done on the sets. After all, production values wise, this is not an Ed Wood production. I shall now prepare to be pelted by eggs and tomatoes, most of them, I assume, coming from Russia and China."

","I didn't really expect much, coming into the IMAX theatre, as I had been advised. I feared of a plot that may have been lacking, a director with a few mishaps like Hellboy, and a budget that was focused all on CG. The CG was basically all I was banking on to make this film one of a kind... Then, minutes into the film, it hit me -- IT IS AWESOME!!!! The plot is well-rounded, with a good focus on characters and the situations surrounding them; the action - intense, and the film was put together beautifully. <br/><br/>What got me most excited was that this could start a revolution of man-operated robot films!! If they could do this, they can do Voltron, Mazinger-Z, Voltes V, Gundam, and nothing would be able to stop them! Just think of the possibilities... They're endless!"

","Well that was two hours of my life which I will not recover. Fortunately I did not pay to see this absurd oeuvre, but borrowed the DVD from the local library. But this is what kids now spend their allowance on??<br/><br/>Too many things to comment on, but among them are: how can only 8 helicopters lift one of these robots, when they weigh 2500 tons? Why don't the kaiju's attack en masse, rather than just one or two at a time? Why can't the robots be controlled remotely, rather than risking the lives of 'pilots'? Why not simply shoot a missile (using all those helicopters) down the kaiju's throat when it inevitably opens up to make a loud roar?"
"thebrickbear","8","13","20","31 July 2013"," Reminds me of the classics. (Might contain some slight spoiler)
","Great movie!<br/><br/>Many directors these days fail to make a good Kaiju movie. I gotta say, this is one of the best. This movie makes me wanna keep watching it again and again, it is truly... epic. <br/><br/>Just a quick Pros n' Cons (without spoiler)<br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>1)CGI & FX: Fantastic interpretation of both the Kaiju and Jaeger. Visual effects demonstrate an excellent example of what an action film should look like. Plus, VFX were used very conservatively unlike many of the recent action films when all you see is explosions explosions fire explosions. 2)Plot n' Story: Very well written. Though, it might be somewhat predictable for many of you movie-goers. The fact that both the antagonist (Kaiju) and protagonist (You know, citizens from earth) are well-balanced. Both sides were quite ""badass"" and did not feel like one was dominating over the other.It was never about being all emotional, but it had a sense of taking a last stand. 3)(Most)Characters: Each character was unique in some way, and each had a story you could expand on. Guillermo Del Toro had thought outside the box in portraying them, and it seemed fresh. 4)Idea: We haven't had a decent Kaiju movie in a while. The movie successfully redefines and sets a new standard for a Kaiju movie. The idea was really fresh. Believe me, I once thought ""Pacific Rim"" was a joke at first, but then it actually made some sense.<br/><br/>Now, for the Cons.. Only one con for me: <br/><br/>1) Charlie Day had to be the most ANNOYING character I had ever seen. I mean...the way he talks is just so arrogant and loud. Every time he speak it sounds so high pitched and hyper. His tone was so angry and impatient. He doesn't have that ""Chris Tucker"" element and he was not funny at all, just plain annoying. The scientific sidekick also seemed like he was on drugs. <br/><br/>Same tone. And moreover, it stands out so badly.<br/><br/>Boo for that.<br/><br/>Besides that, the movie was great, certainty recommend you guys to check it out... in 3D."
"Ric-7","9","13","20","30 July 2013"," Coolant low
","I will keep this short: I was so surprised. I went expecting a cut above the usual action movie, but I was amazed at how terrific this was. The screen play seems to be a collection of virtually every war movie and monster movie cliché imaginable--all of which is obviously intended. It's like an intelligent and witty Transformers film, if you can imagine. The film does not try to be trendy and it avoids witty dialog, TG. The stock characters are given stock lines to say, and they do it perfectly. For example, the eve-of-battle speech.<br/><br/>At first I was wondering if the director knew that the film was just one cliché, in-joke or film reference after another. There was no doubt that he knew, after I saw the ""Coolant Low"" warning.<br/><br/>The 3-D and IMAX were distracting. When (not if) I see it again, it will be in 2-D, which is at least one dimension more than most summer action films lately."
"jeffrey-utley","7","13","20","24 July 2013"," Beyond a Mindless Action Movie
","'Pacific Rim' looked to me like a mindless action movie in the trailer. I thought I was going to the theater to seeing two hours and eleven minutes of giant robots piloted by humans fighting giant aliens. Just about the first hour of this movie makes it more than a mindless action movie. This movie focused on the backgrounds of characters for a while and used character development to make us care about them more. That worked for some of the characters.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie as about average. Some of the performances were better than others. Some aspects of actors' performances were better than others. Charlie Hunnam was more of a lower quality performance. In some parts of the movie, I wasn't convinced he was really Raleigh Becket (his character in the movie), because he wouldn't say some of the dialog with feeling. It was like he was just reading lines some of the time. He had a bit of a British accent in the movie, but it seemed like it was only in affect in a small number of scenes in the movie. I don't think that anyone has a British accent in only a few parts of their life, so that makes it a bad thing. That bring up another performance: Idris Elba's. He had a better British accent than Hunnam, but it still only seemed to be in affect some of the time. Also, his acting performance was good, but he wasn't able to put enough stress on words at times. When Stacker Pentecost (his character) was supposed to put deep feeling into his words, Idris Elba wouldn't be able to put enough feeling into the words. Other than those things, his performance was fine, though. Rinko Kikuchi, who played Mako Mori, had the best performance out of the all of the actors I can think of. She didn't have any accent problems, she was able to put enough stress on words, and I was convinced she was Mako Mori. Her performance was good.<br/><br/>I couldn't find any problems with the writing in this movie. I didn't look for any problems in the writing, but it seemed realistic. In some parts, it seemed it little far fetched, though.<br/><br/>The CGI in this movie was great. It really didn't seem like nothing was there. All of the images blended in with the aspects of the scene. When there was almost nothing but CGI, it seemed like they (the images) were real. The only time I would really tell if there was CGI (if I didn't already know) if it was compared to an actual image.<br/><br/>Now, for the things I went to the movie to see: the action sequences. The action sequences were just CGI's fighting each other. I thought the sequences were great. They were very exciting and exhilarating. The sequences also didn't happen as much as I thought they would, but more would've been less, I think. It might have been like 'Man of Steel', where the action took a long time to get old. Here, the sequences never got old and they stayed exciting. The action was even better than I thought it was going to be in this movie. There's a clear reason for almost everything which causes less thinking during the scenes. Several points to the film for the acting sequences and events.<br/><br/>About the first forty five minutes of this movie after the title came up were character background and development. It did introduce characters and tell their purpose in the story, too. It was interesting at first, but it got old after a while. There was some drama, but it was just slow. I don't know why this movie wanted to be slow in the beginning. Some action movies have been slow in the beginning, but it just didn't work in this one. For the mood of this movie, the logical thing wouldn't be to be slow in the beginning. Being like this almost only takes points away from the movie. Knowing so much about the characters did imply different tones of the movie later on when things would reflect on the character's past. The slowness of the beginning of the movie didn't only consist of character background buildup. Only about half of it consisted of that.<br/><br/>'Pacific Rim' has great images and scenery, barely-below-average acting, average writing, amazing acting sequences, very deep characters, and is well done, but has some bad performances and some boring parts. It was very exciting, had explainable events and aspects, and had a good story. I very much recommend this movie and might buy this movie on DVD when it comes out. My 8/10 rating means 'Pacific Rim' is really good."
"listofnames","8","13","20","19 July 2013"," fun fun fun
","OK, so yes its a special effects extravaganza involving giant robots (called jaeger) fighting giant monster aliens (called kaiju) from another dimension. Which sounds a little worrying especially when the trailers make it look like a longer mighty morphing power rangers episode. It had so much potential to be awful. Guillermo Del Toro (science fiction/fantasy/horror storyteller extraordinaire) of course was not going to let that happen. It turns out to be very entertaining and fun. <br/><br/>One important thing to mention to anyone not in the know is that this film is heavily indebted to the many Japanese films and TV series which tackle a similar giant robot/mecha suited subject. I think perhaps (not that I'm an expert) most notably the TV and film series Neon Genesis Evangelion. I imagine this is the sort of thing that inspired and influenced this film. Which of course is a great thing given how flipping good the first two film recaps have been. If you haven't seen any of this please go seek it out. Therefore it is a nice touch that one of the main characters in Pacific Rim is a Japanese women. <br/><br/>Most of the action is set in Hong Kong but unfortunately, while there is a Chinese Jaeger team and also a Russian team, both have very little screen time or speaking parts. Apart from the main team in the story - Mako and Raleigh, the team with the 2nd most focus is given to the rather bland father and son (Australian? - the accents were hard to define) team. I found myself not caring too much about them to be honest. Felt more for the Chinese and Russians who had much less characterisation. Perhaps the film producers felt that they needed to have a larger white male presence in the film to reflect the films probable viewing demographic. Which I'm sorry to say is just dull, lazy and boring. I'm sure this sort of consideration is necessary for any big expensive film to be given the green light but its sort of disappointing all the same. <br/><br/>The first few minutes of this film manage to do something quite impressive. In this very short time they manage to give a very accurate and believable summary of the first 7 years of the kaiju/human/jaegar war. 7 whole years told exceptionally skillfully in a couple of few minutes. This sets up the film beautifully. <br/><br/>Yes i said believable! How did they manage to make it seem realistic that huge monsters could rampage around major cities a la Godzilla? Plus the fact that said monsters originate from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the pacfic ocean? I don't know either but they did. <br/><br/>The human interest stories are of course what make any film and the relationship between Mako and Stacker (Idris Elba's stern military leader) is quite compelling. A scene involving Mako's initial encounter with a Kaiju and then Stacker as a child is really quite poignant. The child actor plays the part so realistically (all strained breathing and crys) that you wonder if she thought it was actually happening. <br/><br/>Of course there's a whole lot of fun stuff too. Did i mention the giant robots fighting giant alien monsters? Well, its done well, you can actually follow what's happening and the there is invention and creativity in the fights. The special effects are of course top notch. Charlie Day's scientist character is a good laugh throughout the film. The 'drifting' concept (2 humans must share the 'neural load' of piloting a Jaegar and drifting is kind of like a mind meld where they share each other's minds and therefore memories) is used to good effect. <br/><br/>All in all this is as fun and intelligent a film can be considering its plot :) So go see!"

","I saw ""Pacific Rim"" with a friend of mine last night. He's a big fan of Del Torro and we're both monster-movie fans. So for us, watching this movie was a no-brainer. I'm no expert on CGI but at least to my untrained eye the special effects looked great. It was fun watching the mechanicals of the robots and the various weapons of the robots and the monsters. The fight scenes were exciting and the set designs were realistic. Movie-dom has come a long since the late fifties where men wearing Godzilla suits destroyed paper-mache' cities.<br/><br/>Yes, the acting is far from first-rate and the dialogue is clichéd. But I didn't watch this movie to see Lawrence Olivier quality acting or Shakespearean dialogue, that would almost be out of place for an action movie like this. It would be like going to Ruby Tuesdays for a meal served on one-thousand dollar a plate china.<br/><br/>As a side note, I'm surprised this movie isn't a bigger money-maker. At a 180 mil.+ budget they have to sell a lot of tickets. Maybe the rental and foreign markets can take up the slack. A movie like this should be a bonanza for marketing with toys, video games, t-shirts, lunch boxes, etc. I don't have TV but if the makers didn't have a tie-in to a fast-food restaurant chain with small action figures included with ""Happy-Meals"" then they missed a good opportunity to lure the kids and their parents to the local multi-plex. So I would be surprised if this movie doesn't turn a profit, at least eventually. Speaking of kids, this sixty-year old was a ten year old again bringing back fond memories of monster movies I watched back in the fifties and sixties."

","Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim was one of my most anticipated movies this summer. And boy did the movie deliver. I was grinning like an idiot for most of the movie. The movie is just so much damn fun and it had some of the most terrific fight sequences that I've ever seen. It also had great pacing, I wasn't bored at any point in the movie. The set up in the beginning is pretty much perfect as del Toro presents the Kaijus and how the world reacted to them. After that it's just almost non-stop action. <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has really crafted a believable and expansive world that is full of detail. The visual look of the film was beautiful and full of color. You can just feel the joy and passion that del Toro had for the film through the screen. The art direction and the CGI effects in this movie are really impeccable. Guillermo Navarro also did a great job with the cinematography. The camera was always right where it should've been.<br/><br/>The practical sets inside the robots were absolutely fantastic. If they'd done those in CGI, the movie would've definitely lost something substantial. I loved how it looked and how you got a great perspective into what it would be like to be inside of that robot. The practical sets that were used throughout the movie with the CGI really grounded the experience. <br/><br/>The CGI Jaegers and Kaijus were done terrifically and they had a tremendous sense of weight to them. There was also enough differences between the Kaijus to keep the action interesting and the battles different. Every Jaeger also had a distinct theme to it and they were really well conceived. The sound design in this movie was also great and it really added to the intensity of the film. The great epic score by Ramin Djawadi really pumped me up during the fights. <br/><br/>Despite the movie being a big spectacle it actually had good enough characters that I actually cared and rooted for them. I didn't like the scientists though, they were a bit too eccentric and over the top for my taste. Ron Perlman was funny though because he's just awesome as a person. I thought Charlie Hunnam made for a likable hero and Rinko Kikuchi does a great job as Mako. Idris Elba really nails his role as the tough commander with a heart. The drifting sequences were visually interesting and they were used well in conveying the backgrounds of the characters. The plot is what it is but it fits a spectacle movie like this pretty much perfectly. Approach this film with the right expectations and you'll have an enjoyable time. <br/><br/>You have to see this in the cinema while it's still there, it really adds to the experience. It's an extremely enjoyable and fun pop corn flick, my favorite of the summer blockbusters so far."

","For those who may think this is a Transformers ripoff only because of giant robots, let me tell you that this film is far better than any of Michael Bay's crap lately. The first Transformers film was the only remotely good one, but even this film tops that. Guillermo del Toro's films have always been a favorite of mine (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy 2, and so on), and I trusted that with his hand behind this giant robot vs giant monster plot, that it would be good. 2 hours later, I was taken completely back.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is simply, wait for it, AWESOME. The effects and animation on the Jaegers and Kaiju are phenomenal, and the fight scenes are some of the best giant creature fights you've ever seen. You can actually tell what's happening, and see every devastating blow these beast lay out on each other. And the acting is rather good too, thank God we didn't have to put up with a Lebouf performance, and Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and Rinko Kikuchi deliver excellently as the three main leads. The story, though I don't want to give anything away, is told very well, and is easy to keep up with (unlike a clusterf*** like Transformers 2) and actually manages to tug at a few heartstrings, especially during a very well done and unsettling scene with a young girl in hong Kong in a flash back.<br/><br/>Point is, go see this movie. Belay any negative comments you've heard about it. If everyone gave this a chance, there's something in this movie that they would all enjoy from any aspect of it. Amazing effects and fight scenes, good solid acting and characters, fun story, all rolled into one to make (until part 2 of the Hobbit) my favorite film so far this year.<br/><br/>9/10 Pacific Rim"

","... And that's pretty much it. In the first minutes of the movie the whole story is so quickly summed up that it makes you wonder if it was something the editor felt he should throw in a couple of hours before the first screening. And then there's little left of a story to tell after that, so the easy solution is, of course, a lengthy bombardment of intense monster-mash- robot-high-tech extravaganza. In addition to this, it doesn't really have much potential to be a movie that you remember for being very distinct (giant monsters trying to destroy the world, mankind desperately defending itself, etc). And as for what the characters goes, You hardly remember them by the time the credits are done. There's no time to bond with them in any way between all the fighting scenes. If you can't really bring yourself to care about whether the monsters or the humans win in the end, you know something has gone wrong. Pacific Rim has fallen into the CG-trap, emphasizing visuals and forgetting about the story. Someone are sure to be blown away by all this, if they are into that sort of movies. I for one, was not."

","Before watching PACIFIC RIM I noticed it had a lot of critics really hammered down on it and truth be told it really wasn't that bad. Then again I stopped listening to critics a long time ago. Although many would agree it could be somewhat overblown with special effects but it did have a decent plot. The acting wasn't the best but also not the worst. All the effects were very nicely done and the fight sequences were very engaging partly because the film established what was at stake before them.<br/><br/>All in all, PACIFIC RIM isn't as bad as critics say it is in fact I think they might have been too harsh. The best way to see PACIFIC RIM is probably without expecting to much and to judge for yourself if you like it or not.

The Humans are hard pressed to fight the incredible monsters, while the creatures are Ratcheting up their plan of world conquest. If one were to select a slight criticism of the movie I would ask why 90% of the movie is filmed in the dark. It is difficult to study all the fantastic art work which went into the filming and the story itself is hobbled by inconclusive ends which remain unresolved.

","I thought to myself ""giant monsters beaming themselves into the pacific, fighting giant robots, what could be wrong with that?"" And the answer is, quite a bit...quite....a....bit.<br/><br/>I'll start with what del Toro has done well here, he's created some incredible sets, I mean these sets are enormous, and he's used CGI to make these hangers and workshops every bit as jaw dropping as you'd hope if the world had really pooled its resources in such a way. If only your favorite nerd sci fi TV show had this budget. There are some great scenes, great stills. And for the effort here, and for the balls to make such a movie, I'm giving this a pass. 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>From about the 2 minute mark, or very early on at least, the movie pretty much tells you what kind of movie you are are about to watch, for the next 2.4 hours of your life. Firstly it's a movie with no real people in it. The authorities in this world must be incredibly stupid for a start, who are wanting to abandon the fighting machine project in favor of building sea walls. After 25 seconds of this movie we know that his insane, and that here we are dealing with a 12 year old world in which the authorities are pretty much no smarter than your stupid parents. The good guys, the warriors, are unfortunately no smarter, despite all the cool things they've surrounded them selves with, and have the emotional intelligence of wookies. These characters are so clichéd and predictable you want to slap them all every time you see them. A movie like Starship Troopers is Hamlet compared to this screenplay.<br/><br/>Beyond this, the only remotely interesting thing is watching the fight scenes and the monsters trash the cities. But I venture that despite the huge budget thrown at it, even this does not deliver. To make the monsters continually more scary del Toro relies more and mo on CGI throughout, and so they become less and less real. For all their size and fury, they are far far far less scary than the monster from Cloverrfield, to pick a random monster comparison. And the fight scenes, really start to get boring, and the end is merciful indeed.<br/><br/>All in all, the question is ""how can a 170 million dollar budget result in something so unsatisfactory?"". This movie is terribly out of proportion, a movie from the mind of a child, and the budget of Apple, it isn't good, it's not art, it's barely entertainment."

We weren't five minutes into this piece of expensive garbage when we heard; ""Don't get cocky, kid!"" I got a point for predicting that.

To fight them off, we (the people of Earth) put aside our hateful ways toward each other and build giant 30-story- tall robots that require two people to perform a computerized mind meld to run.

"thejoshl","7","27","49","11 July 2013"," Pacific Rim is a stunning mindless action film, but in the end that's all it is; a mindless action film.
","Words could not describe how excited I was for Pacific Rim. Yes, it was a blockbuster about giant robots fighting giant monsters, but between Del Toro directing and all the early praise it was receiving from critics and filmmakers alike I went into the early screening extremely giddy. I'm sorry to say I didn't leave the theatre with the same enthusiasm.<br/><br/>In 2013 a wormhole known as ""The Breach"" connected our world with another, letting monsters known as ""Kaiju"" invade earth. Millions of people were killed and entire cities were levelled After years of defeat in the war against the Kaiju the governments of the world joined together and developed ""Jaegers"", giant fighting robots sort of Mighty Morphing Power Rangers meets Gundam. We pick up in the year 2025 with the Jaeger program failing as bigger and deadlier Kaiju are coming out of the Breach. With not much time left the governments call together the last of the Jaegers for one last final showdown in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie. In fact I wanted to love it but I didn't. For the opening 30 minutes I was really into it, the quick news flash wrap up of the Kaijus first landing and the invention of Jaegers led me to believe this movie was going in a different direction than the trailer showed and I deeply wanted it to. Since there was so much praise for this film, there had to be more to it, right?<br/><br/>There wasn't. Everything plot-wise was given away in the trailer. The only thing that trailer didn't show was the bad dialogue and over-the-top acting (arguable). There is lots of intentional comedy, which worked fine, but the rest was the bad kind of cheesy; the kind where you can't tell if they made a mistake or not. While I'm sure people are going to tell me it was intentional I can't say that it being intentional really makes it better in this case. I'm a huge fan of that meta/self-aware style but only when they use it to say something, to drive their theme or message home and I can assure you the overall message in Pacific Rim was not driven forward by ironic poorly delivered dialogue.<br/><br/>Despite the overall negative tone of this review I actually ended up having plenty of fun with the film and I will say that it is an awesome monster movie. The overall production was quite a marvel to watch. The visuals are breathtaking and the soundtrack/sound design compliments the visuals masterfully. There is no doubt that Del Toro has left his visual signature all over this film. The soundtrack wasn't a bunch of dubstep noises either, which was one of my only concerns going into the film originally. There was actual score and it built up the emotion of the scenes better than most of the actors did. I would say that this film is highly enjoyable,as long as you don't go in expecting more - which I will admit is difficult if you've read any early discussions on the film.<br/><br/>I put most of the blame on myself. I'm sure if I didn't hype this movie, and didn't read all the early praises I would have had a much better time with it. That's why I'm giving this film a decent rating, since I firmly believe it's my fault for not being in the right state of mind. The way people were reacting made me expect that this would be more than the trailer, more depth to it, you know? Pacific Rim is a stunning mindless action film, but in the end that's all it is; a mindless action film. I guess it's my fault for expecting more.<br/><br/>I can't stress how much I wanted to love this film enough. I REALLY love Guillermo's work however this just didn't do it for me. I'm sure this movie will find its audience and I'm also sure my review will get ripped apart by his fans. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it again in a different mindset. I think I'll like it more the second time. <br/><br/>Our Rating: 7.0/10<br/><br/>Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of Pacific Rim!<br/><br/>More reviews at themoviebloggers.com."
"JolinKnight","7","11","17","7 December 2013"," Quite a fair rate by now
","7.2 out of 10 by now with one fifth million users it is a predictable rate for this movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie didn't earn their budget back leaving a nearly 10 million deficit. It is also foreseeable as using the similar technique as Transformer but as awesome fighting scenes as its, the only consequence is paying back in box. The plot is quite simple fighting the monsters which is quite like a Japanese series used to be seen in childhood, in other words, maybe only children like it and only people want to relax without thinking too munch of movies would like pick this one. Obviously it has some plots aiming to touch the audience but it seems the effects are not very impressive.<br/><br/>In terms of the good aspects, at least it gives a happy ending. The giant robots maybe satisfy the geeks. Also I like the perform Rinko did in this film it is definitely a Japanese performing which is very cute. She can be very serious very tough but behind that she is fragile needing a shoulder to rely on. That is also the reason why Japanese girls are good wives they are melt LOL.<br/><br/>In conclusion it is fit for children but not for the ones too small maybe 10 years old and above. Apparently it is for box but failed. Well nothing to say but good luck to the next one."

","I'm not going to give any summary of the plot line, as much of it is derivative from enough films we've all seen before. The dialogue is simplistic, the acting cast little better but it's a CGI-fest.<br/><br/>Don't go into this film thinking you are going to find any new great gem. It's part-Godzilla, part-Avatar, part-Independence Day and so on. It looks good, but there's hardly any good story. I was mostly bored.<br/><br/>Some are going to like this a lot, as evidenced by the surprisingly positive reviews from the professional critics. Many others will just find it to be a passable action sci-fi thrill. I've seen much better elsewhere, and think you will have too. Up to you."
"valiantvu","7","6","8","14 December 2013"," Hilarious and Visually Stunning
","The overly dramatic acting and dialogue hits you right off the bat in Pacific Rim, but if you can laugh through this then you can enjoy the incredible CG that comprises the bulk of the film. Pure-action-crappy-everything-else films rarely entertain me all the way through, but my eyes couldn't help feasting on the fight scenes between the incredibly detailed Kaiju and the shiny, badass Jaegers.<br/><br/>Each fight takes it up a notch, progressing from the first ""fist"" fight intro to fights with a frickin awesome sword, cargo ships, flying Kaiju, and so on. One of my favorite scenes was when the Kaiju baby bursts out of its dead mother and then chokes itself on its umbilical cord. I really loved the design of all the Kaijus and how they were each very different. Serious kudos to the CG artists and animators - I especially liked the bioluminescence element they added.<br/><br/>As for the plot and characters, they were totally absurd. The one working defense system that the international community has pooled their resources into has two scientists - TWO - that no provides resources or listens to. Stacker, the commanding officer, only pauses once in a while to yell ""SHUT UP!"" at them. There was some pretty crappy acting by the two leads, but watching it in conjunction with the absurdity of all of the other characters, dialogue, and plot, just made everything funnier.<br/><br/>If I had watched this in theaters, I probably would've been groaning to myself through the whole film, but being able to joke and laugh through a lot of the scenes, I found myself thoroughly enjoying it and appreciating the aspects that were truly well done."
"keeshaotto","8","6","8","3 December 2013"," Pacific Rim has realistic technology
","Pacific Rim depicts a future in which the human race is in danger from extinction due to conflict. The conflict is resolved with the use of technology. The technology that is created was done so at a global level; all parts of the world came together, forgetting the conflicts with each other to work for the better good. <br/><br/>The movie follows a young man, Raleigh Becket, portrayed by Charlie Hunnam, through his experience with the Jager program. The Jager program is a military initiative to fight against the Kaiju, the alien threat. Jagers are manned machines that use a combination of bionic, neurological, and exoskeleton technology. The Jagers and piloted by two people, each neurologically connected to the other and the machine through a process called ""the drift"". The drift is a neurological connection in which two people meld minds through memories and are able to think and act as one with the machine. Each pilot is in charge of one hemisphere and each hemisphere is connected to the corresponding side of the Jager. <br/><br/>The technology used in Pacific Rim is realistic. We have the technology to build a bionic suit and the technology to control prosthetics with thought. This movie depicts a very real future for technology. The piece of technology that may be far-fetched is the ""drift"" between the two pilots. But even that technology is not completely unreasonable. Right now the technology exists to connect two minds using electrical brain recordings and a form of magnetic stimulation. Obviously the alien threat is unlikely but we have built great technology for far lesser reasons."

The entire thing is ridiculous, from plot holes to simple visual errors. But at the end of this movie, you won't have that feeling of wasted time. It's like watching a Transformers movie that has a purpose. If you ever wanted to witness a life-sized action-figure world with silly robots, impossible technology, watch this movie.

","I thoroughly enjoyed his movie fro start to finish, even the comical parts which in an other film would have been out of place. I initially thought it was the follow up to cloverfield. But filmed totally differently but i think I am wrong about that. <br/><br/>There were some lines/ designs throughout the film which plays homage to star Wars, but done in a way which enhances the film.<br/><br/>This is a film that can be watched so many times over the fight scenes are great but are grounded by the actors. If the film has one problem it is the main character sounds a bit punch drunk and the acting is a little wooden but Sean slater (eastenders) is great apart from his slightly dodgy accent and Luther is awesome as always. It all ties together so undoubtedly thanks to del toro's direction and story telling which left me putting some pieces together which is clearly deliberate. There will hopefully be a sequel."

","I didn't dislike this movie; giant robots against giant monsters is a fun idea that isn't like anything else being done right now. But the dialog needed to be smarter. I think there is more going on with the characters than I picked up from one viewing--I gotta believe Del Toro put in some layers you have to dig for. But on the surface, it comes off like some of the sillier action movies of the early 80's. Some notes for the sequel: 1. Hire a writer that speaks the language the film gets made in; 2. Get someone in there that understands color design--maybe you could sell some toys if everything wasn't all the same shade of blue-gray; 3. Don't bother having the giant robots throw the giant monsters when they're fighting in water. It doesn't hurt. Show more damage. It's cool when body parts break off. Kthnx, j.g."

Yes, it's a bit formulaic, and if you're looking for the Academy's next darling, move along. However, if what you're looking for is a sci-fi actioner with imaginative monsters, great special effects, good futuristic tech, well done battle scenes, and lots of robots and aliens, then this movie is or you. <br/><br/>With the exception of a little profanity, it is totally suitable for the boys (mine are 6 and up) who were on the edge of their seat throughout and absolutely loved it."

","Before going to see Pacific Rim I had read quite a few mixed reviews. I really was sort of ambivalent about going to see it, even though I am quite fond of big action and monsters.<br/><br/>We opted to see it in IMAX 3D, which got a thumbs down from me (3D films should be filmed in 3D to really pull it off. Conversions are just weird in my opinion) but others in my group thought it really enhanced the action so use your own discretion.<br/><br/>After sitting through the movie, I have to ask... ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??"" I can't for the life of me figure out how folks could have issues with the movie. I thought it was a brilliant homage to the Godzilla movies of yore with a healthy dash of the fun of Anime robots but beautifully filmed and well acted by everyone involved. This is precisely what a summer popcorn movie is supposed to be. Just all kinds of exciting.<br/><br/>The action might be too much for the under 10 kiddos. I don't recall any excessive use of language or inappropriate sexual situations."
"Theodor-turner","7","13","21","25 July 2013"," Tarantino, take note: I you're going to pay homage to old film genres, do it right.
","Pacific Rim is largely an action epic, and a good one at that. The narrative itself is based on Japanese monster (kaiju) films, and - while paying homage to the classic 'style' - manages to be very modern and fairly grounded in reality. Pacing is good and the story has a set of well-placed twists, accompanied by some interesting character development. The casting, on the other hand, is not great, but does not detract from the experience. <br/><br/>In contrast, the direction is fantastic. Guillermo del Toro does a great job of making the large and scary feel huge and terrifying, without making a mess on-screen. Several great touches add to the 'epic' feel of the film, such as the detail on the hide of the kaiju and the fantastic sound effects. Coupled with a great musical score, this film would be one of the best this year. Sadly, there is a small problem that stops this film being fantastic, but great instead: the scientist sub-plot.<br/><br/>Two scientists are in the process of finding a new way to stop the kaiju, and they manage to be fairly useless and rather annoying. They have a fair number of cheesy lines, which left me wishing that their sub-plot had been left out of the film. Nevertheless, Pacific Rim is still very good, and definitely worth watching. I give it an 8 out of 10."

All the indications were that it was going to be a couple of hours of mindless fun, action packed, unpretentious and tick all the boxes for a Friday night popcorn movie. Sad to say that despite the fact I expected little in the way of acting and dialog, even the action had me bored and a little bemused. I found it messy, overcooked and repetitive. I haven't left a film in years feeling such a sense of relief that it was finally over. I did tonight. Even my son, who is 8, felt underwhelmed by the whole experience. What's happened to modern cinema? Where's the euphoria, the emotion, the exhilaration and real sense of storytelling gone? In short, i felt it was a monstrous mess... CGI CGI CGI CGI.... blah blah blah.

"bob the moo","Null","8","12","3 November 2013"," Enjoyable monster movie that doesn't pretend to be anything else
","Part of the reason I have started completely sitting out the summer blockbuster season is that I just got fed up going to crowded noisy cinemas to be disappointed by films that promised much but deliver just basic effects and little else. With Pacific Rim though, it is hard to feel this way because it is a film that has never pretended to be anything other than a Japanese inspired monster movie where big robots hit big aliens in a way that pretty much never makes much sense when you think about it. The plot is explained very quickly at the start of the film and we then jump into the future where the war we just learned about is reaching a peak. From here we have some doubt, some lessons to learn, barriers to overcome but really what we have are big special effects punching each other. And it works.<br/><br/>It is easy to wring one's hands and say that blockbusters are the death of film, but all things have a place as long as they are done well and this is at least an honest and fun film. I say honest because it has no pretension to it – it is plain and simple a monster movie with a very big budget behind it. The effects are good, with good monster design and generally a sense of fun and energy to the deliver. Of course it is just effects hitting other effects but it works for what it is and at least does this well – unlike other films that would aspire to more but yet can't even do this with any skill. The action sequences are large and fun throughout and the soapy drama doesn't get in the way at all. The film is loaded with references which I mostly got – the voice of GLaDOS being my favorite one.<br/><br/>The cast are not particularly famous but it doesn't matter since the effects are the stars here. That said I thought they did a good job, in particular I enjoyed seeing Elba, Day, Collins, Kikuchi and others in their various roles. Del Toro continues his love of all things geeky with this film and in terms of direction it looks good, with plenty going on but never not being clear and engaging.<br/><br/>It isn't a brilliant film by any means but it is a straightforward one that is honest with the viewer. Robots punching monsters – that is all that is promised and on that it very much delivers. If this sounds like your thing then this will hit the spot no problem."
"nick-garrett1995","9","12","20","26 July 2013"," What Did You Expect?
","I notice a lot of people pointing out the many flaws of this movie, of which there are, indeed many. But honestly, what did you expect going into the theatre? I sat down next to people who were discussing Gundam, Godzilla, anime etc. I myself had very few requirements of this movie for it to be good. I wanted to see giant robots fight giant monsters in a very large city. You know what I got? I got giant robots fighting giant monsters in a very large city. Surprise, surprise<br/><br/>In the meantime I enjoyed seeing an homage to the classic genre of, what, giant things fighting each other, which I wanted. I grew up watching black and white VHS tapes of Godzilla vs fill in the blank so maybe I enjoyed it a little more than the average person and it had been quite some time since I'd seen something like that. Cloverfield was a unique take on it but it lacked the epicness of two titans facing off. This is quite possibly the most epic of the giant monster genre since it has them in abundance. <br/><br/>What it boils down to is just that, expectation. I did NOT expect the acting to be quality and it wasn't. I did NOT expect the storyline to be interesting and maybe I had a little too low of expectation for that because it reached a point where even that became a little interesting as the movie drew me further and further in. My single regret is that I didn't see it on a bigger screen and didn't see it in 3D. I would pay to see it again just for that experience. I've always had an appreciation for epicness and it doesn't get much more epic than trying to protect the last of the human race from immeasurably large monsters with equally immeasurably large robots and all the contextual issues that come along with it.<br/><br/>I give this a 9/10 because this movie is exactly what it was meant to be and nothing more. I would have given it a 10/10 only if the acting was better and the story was legitimately good but my opinion of what a good story is is pretty high.<br/><br/>Thank you Guileermo Del Toro for giving me a nostalgic experience on the big screen."
"nlbn-3112","9","11","18","11 July 2013"," Great entertainment and a bit of heart
","Just got back from an opening day screening of Pacific Rim and to begin with i have to say i was satisfied with what i saw. This movie is arguably the movie that i have been anticipating most for this year (maybe even more than Man of Steel of Iron Man 3), for the fact that this is totally some fresh idea in Hollywood for a long while. Now to the movie itself, in terms of action, it was totally satisfying and even more than that. It started right off with a Kaiju and Jaeger battle that more than delivered, and subsequently, more fights came on with increasing level of awesomeness, and well paced out so it does not make us ask ourselves when are all these fighting gonna end? (hint: Transformers 3). Guillermo del Toro certainly is good in coming up with fresh and dope ideas, like the plasma cannon and having the Typhoon with 3 arms and turning bodies. It was totally unexpected ways of fighting from the Jaeger that made me very happy, rather than just the punch and kick and shoot rockets like i imagined before going into the theater. Action wise, i rated this higher than the Transformers franchise (with part 1 arguably an exception), and Battleship or Godzilla. Special mention to the IMAX version, if you don't mind paying the extra, then go for the IMAX, it will be crazy :) In terms of heart, this movie certainly did delivered as well. The director said himself the movie is about humans, and it certainly was. With all the awesome fighting mentioned, i still felt that it was only an icing to the cake, rather a bonus to a well shown relationships between the Commander and Mako, as well as the father and son in Striker Eureka. It was the humans that made the Jaegers. At the end of the day, the film succeeded in making me believe that this is humanity fighting back, but not the robots. Now to the weaker part, i felt that some parts of the movie needed a bit more development, and also the movie will certainly do better with a better male lead. In the beginning of the 2nd act, they totally didn't brought me with why Becket has to return. I mean why didn't they come and find him in the 5 years in between? Next up, one line is all it takes to change his mind over such catastrophic incidents? Throughout the whole movie, i felt like Becket was just simply...there, he didn't shine, he didn't provide the sparks he could have. Idris Alba and Rinko did a better job for me, it was believable display from them. All in all, if you go in the theater wanting for some pure entertainment to relieve stress, and maybe a bit of smile on your face over the heart of the story, Pacific Rim is perfect for this weekend."

","Yes, I do find this man more disappointing than your average action director. It isn't that his movies are any dumber than others. They aren't. It is a reverse prejudice based on two qualities. <br/><br/>He has a powerful visual ability, in beings, environments and machines. It irks me to no end that he cannot turn this to visual storytelling. The visuals are engaging. The stories are dull and have no intrinsic connection to what we see.<br/><br/>The other expectation is the Hispanic filmmaker's dilemma: so very many use a tradition inaptly called magical realism. Poetry invades physics and we can either have a story where the nature of the story bends the nature of the world, or we have a parallel world interwoven within ours for a while. <br/><br/>I am so taken with this style of filmmaking that I would now perish without it. Even Rodreguez has it in his kiddie and troubling exploitation movies. That del Toro seems so oblivious to this richness, while excelling in others that matter.... It is like a master chef's meal that is lovely but made from paper. <br/><br/>So all this big slugging machinery? Paper."

","My two cents. I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. It was somewhere middle of the road for me. The good: Set Design, The effects(The best I have ever seen), 3D, Idris Elba, Ron Perlman. The Bad: The Script, Bad Casting.<br/><br/>Charlie Hunnam is great on SOA, but he is pretty much a one note actor. He has no charisma at all in the film and is boring to watch. Rinko Kikuchi while pretty to look at, comes across as a Asian stereotype. Her and Hunnam have no chemistry together at all. For two people that are suppose to be link they sure don't act like it at all. Charlie Day good god, I guess he was suppose to be the comic relief. But he comes off annoying and most of his scenes could have been cut and would have improved the film.<br/><br/>To be honest I found it over long and just OK. Which is a shame because I love Del Toro and really wanted this to be a huge hit for him. I think It really comes down to casting, as bland as the script is some actors with chemistry and charisma would have gone along way it make it a lot more enjoyable.<br/><br/>So there you have it."

"btnthx","Null","12","21","11 July 2013"," Pacific Rim Christmas came early....
","How do you make the perfect summer movie? I'm not just talking about the best action movie, or the best summer comedy, just the perfect summer movie. Some would say lots of explosions, while others may say a good love story will always do the trick. Every year all the studios aim to release a movie that you will want to see, their idea of that great summer movie. Well I think Guillermo del Toro has figured it out, Robots Vs. Monsters.<br/><br/>I know it can't be that simple, since we already had a Cowboys and Aliens that didn't live up to expectations, but for me ""Pacific Rim"" really is. We have always looked to the stars for where we thought visitors might arrive on our planet one day. But, what if they come from deep within our oceans? That is the question ""Pacific Rim"" poses. Creatures called ""Kaiju"" have attacked the coastal cities in the Pacific. They start in San Francisco, and then attack cities like Manila, and Cabo. After conventional weapons have little effect, the world's governments decide the only way to fight monsters, is to build monsters of their own. The ""Jaeger Program"" is born, where giant robots are built to fight for mankind. Each Jaeger is controlled by two pilots, who control each hemisphere in the Jaeger. The Jaegers become mankind's best weapon against the ""Kaiju"" and their only way to save the planet. <br/><br/>This is what ""Transformers"" could have been, if del Toro had been at the helm instead of Michael Bay. While Bay has always been a visual director, he just does not have the complete package like del Toro. This movie has something for everyone, but above all it is just fun to watch. It is a big and loud, and one of those movies that are made to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. For everything that is wrong with summer movies like ""After Earth"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" this movie gets it right. This is not a movie that is going to get praised for its great story, even though it has a decent one. The main selling point is ""come see this movie and you get to see giant robots and monsters beat the crap out of each other."" I mean really after that what more do you need? I went in expecting to see one of the best movies of the summer and walked out not thinking any different. The performances for the most part are not anything special, except for every time Idris Elba is on the screen. Given the best dialogue, including a speech any football coach would love, Elba just commands your attention. In a world where sequels rule, we should embrace originally. I mean didn't we say all we needed to say with the original ""Grown Ups""? Do we really need another? I say this weekend when you go to the movies see ""Pacific Rim"". It's like sequels are the ""Kaiju"" and this is your chance to command a Jaeger and to tell the world you are tired of all the ""Kaiju"". And if you can, see it 'IMAX' big, because this movie doesn't do anything small.<br/><br/>Brian Taylor <br/><br/>http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"

","Only one word can describe Pacific Rim, and that is ""Wow!"". It got everything I need in a robot vs monster movie except one thing, which otherwise would make it a perfect movie.<br/><br/>The movie got huge robots and huge monsters (that's obvious). It got great CGI, great robot vs monster fighting sequences, a surprisingly quite good story (which should be expected in a Guillermo del Toro movie, but which I didn't expect much at first in this kind of movie), rocket punch, Portal game's GlaDOS voice, and it even got (borrowing the term from Voltus V anime) the ""Tenkuu ken""! How awesome it is! But, as I said before, it is missing something. Something very important.<br/><br/>== Warning: this part may contain spoiler ==<br/><br/>Because Guillermo himself said that he wanted to ""honor"" the kaiju and mecha genres (while creating an original stand-alone film), and because he also said (in one of the promotional featurette videos) that he was influenced by Japanese big robot anime of his time like ""Tetsujin 28"", and also because one of the promotional posters featured a Japanese jaeger called ""Coyote Tango"", the absence of a Japanese jaeger really bothers me. I would give this movie a perfect ten stars if it shows even one sequence of a Japanese robot kicking a kaiju's ass, and not just featuring one Tokyo scene and two Japanese actresses. I personally think that Guillermo should at least give a nod to Japanese mecha anime genre. But no, Coyote Tango was not in the movie, so I take out two stars out of this movie."
"griffolyon12","9","17","32","12 July 2013"," A Spoiler-Free Review of ""Pacific Rim""
","As a kid growing up, a lot of the times during the Summer I would get bored with no one else around to hang out with. I mean, what else does a film obsessed kid do when he's bored in the Summer? Well, he makes a movie of course. However, what type of movies? There were no other kids around in my neighborhood to use as actors, so I made monster movies. Some of the times these movies starred our cat, but seeing as how living creatures were more difficult to work with, most of my monster movies starred a marionette creature or stuffed animals, with action figures playing the human roles. There were no scripts, just my imagination literally making everything up as I went along with our Hi-8 video camera in tow. All of this to say, I've always loved monster movies, and Pacific Rim may just be one of the best, if not the most original monster movies ever made.<br/><br/>What makes Pacific Rim so original is that it mashes up two Japanese film genres, those of the giant monster and the giant robot, and creates a movie that is unlike anything that Western audiences have ever seen before. Pitting giant robots versus giant monsters was a genius idea that I wish I had come up with, and screenwriter Travis Beacham deserves huge kudos for coming up with the idea. The thing is though, this film wouldn't be worth watching if it didn't manage to have more going for it than just giant robots and giant monsters. Beacham and director Guillermo Del Toro go beyond that simple idea and actually have created likable characters and an involving story to go along with the awesome spectacle, and that's why Pacific Rim should be considered one of the best monster movies ever made.<br/><br/>If you've ever seen any Godzilla movie or episode of Japanese animation (i.e. anime) featuring giant robots, then you will recognize all of the character types that exist in this movie. Pacific Rim is really like anime brought to life in live action, and if this movie can achieve such believable results, then can a live action Mobile Suit Gundam movie be far behind? One can only hope, but for right now, as a fan of anime and Japanese entertainment, Pacific Rim manages to introduce American audiences to all of the Japanese film and anime tropes that many of the kids in my generation have been in love with for our entire lives. However, I don't want anyone reading this who has never seen any anime or previous monster movies to think that this movie is not for them.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is really a movie for anyone who just loves a good time at the movies. It's fun, action packed, and is emotionally involving. Unlike so many Summer blockbusters that take themselves too seriously, Pacific Rim manages to balance the humor with the seriousness to create a lighthearted adventure film that still carries weight and consequence through the character's actions, but you're having a blast while the world is literally on the brink of destruction. Guillermo Del Toro treats this film as if it's like a propaganda film from the WWII days, where he's idolizing the pilots of these giant robots, trying to inspire humanity with hope and optimism to actually rise up and meet the monsters rather than getting crushed under their feet. Of course, I'll reiterate this point, had the characters not have worked, neither would have this movie. The characters and their relationships with one another are what gives this movie dramatic heft when it most matters, to where when we reach the action, it's not just mayhem for the sake of mayhem, it actually means something.<br/><br/>In case you haven't noticed, I loved Pacific Rim. Few movies are this imaginative and this much fun, and that's the main thing to take away from this movie. From a design standpoint, this is one of the more meticulously crafted made up worlds I've seen in recent years, and that is a testament to Del Toro's gifted cinematic eye. The action is stand up and cheer awesome, thanks to amazing FX work from Industrial Light and Magic. As for the characters, none of them would work if the actors playing them weren't so likable, from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and Charlie Day, to the emotionally vulnerable performance from Rinko Kikuchi, they're the ones that actually make us care about the story. Bottom line, this isn't another Summer blockbuster trying to play off of post-9/11 fears and anxieties, it's literally a movie about the goodness of humanity and the power of the human spirit to work together when it's most needed, and who doesn't want to see that?<br/><br/>I give Pacific Rim a 9 out of 10!"

","Guillermo's sold his poor soul to the bleak, hope grinding Hollywood machine. And unfortunately he's taken Ron Perlman along for the ride. I saw the trailers; I was prepared to see a somewhat shallow sci-fi action flick with lots of monsters and robots. But this... This gargantuan, monstrously concocted mind numbing piece of celluloid refuse had me almost in tears of exasperation. The only reason I went to see this was the vain flicker of hope at seeing del Toro's name at the helm, having seen some of his early stuff - amongst others the beautifully eerie Devil's Backbone. How does a promising director with such a flair for suspense end up serving his used toilet paper to be projected on cinema screens? I would love to know. I couldn't understand half of what was being hollered at me through the deafening rain, overpowering tuba farts and gnarling metal. I couldn't see half of what was going on thanks to the constant night (is the lack of light a metaphor of the director's mind?) and the driving rain, both used to great effect to mask any failings in the CGI. Despite this, I could still predict every minute of this sad cliché bonanza as it was unfolding. Watch the trailers, they're entertaining; you'll see everything worth seeing (the good CGI) and spare yourself the disappointing (lack of) story line and unfortunate acting. 2/10, and that's giving it an extra point for the detailed effects."

","It has been a long time since I saw a movie in a theater that actually exceeded my expectations, but Pacific Rim really did.<br/><br/>Everything fits in this movie: the storytelling, character build - up and - oh man - the special effects. It's not easy to make a fight between a robot and a gigantic monster seem real and thrilling, but Guillermo does it. I was on the edge of my seat, heart throbbing during some of the battles.<br/><br/>It's not just blunt action, hopping from one scene to another without a decent story behind it to back it up. This is something we see too often lately, but Pacific Rim makes a beautiful exception.<br/><br/>Keep up the good work Guillermo, I hope this one gets a follow - up as it deserves. Can't wait to see that one."

","Its a well rounded movie, it has great action, hints of humor at the right moments, and has a little bit of everything. Unlike most movies, I like the female main character's personality and how she is portrayed in the movie. I also like how she's Asian. They don't over sexualize Mako or the relationship between her and Raleigh, which I enjoyed a lot. I loved the relationship between the two, how deeply they connected and how their relationship developed. They don't over emphasize things in the movie, which I really liked. They give you just enough to be satisfactory and hint at the rest, they don't overwhelm you with certain aspects of the movie. This movie isn't mind blowing, life changing, or touches your heart and pulls at its strings, but overall it was enjoyable and entertaining. It was a nice movie to watch and nothing about it really frustrated me or made me want to change it. It's like Goldilocks and the three bears, it's the porridge that's not to hot and not to cold, it's just right."

","""Pacific Rim"" is a spectacle for the eyes and ears. I mean this movie is a visual treat from well detailed robot and monster designs to high over the top, but well choreographed action sequences and massive collateral damage. The world that Guillermo del Toro creates is imaginative and his character designs are mesmerizing and complex. The sound design and the sheer force of the films score captivates you into a ride of sight and sound that pleases all your senses. From the metal grinding noise of the robots to the fleshy and almost beast like cry the monsters make, this film has you feeling like you are right there in the middle of the action.<br/><br/>While the movie is mostly is a visual treat, it doesn't forget about its characters and there humanity. The film isn't all bells and whistles, it really does have some really nice character moments in its script, which are about overcoming fear, moving on and trust. These moments make us care for the events that are unfolding. However, the script isn't all serious business, it knows when to have fun. Some of these moments can be a bit too campy though and some of the emotional moments feel forced. The film sometimes even becomes contrived, mainly towards the end. However, director Guillermo del Toro balances things pretty well.<br/><br/>The actors in this film do a pretty good job, but the only real standout is Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost.This character is sort of the leader of the resistance and Elba commands attention every second on screen. Charlie Hunnam is pretty good as Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot, who left the resistance after a traumatic incident. I wish they showed more of his inner battle, it would have invested us into the story more. Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori is really hit or miss. The scenes where she is more reserved are good, but when she tries to emote, it can be awkward at times. The rest of the cast is pretty solid and the supporting cast is pretty good, especially Charlie Day, who brings some of the lighter moments to the film.<br/><br/>Overall ""Pacific Rim"" as a giant robot versus giant monster movie is pretty awesome. The visuals, sound, and well directed action are all top-notch. They provide a treat for the eyes like never before. Even the 3D is spectacular, the best I've seen since ""Avatar,"" it really absorbs you into del Toro's imaginative world. The story, mainly the human element, is a bit weaker as it can feel contrived at times. It keeps us involved, but never takes us to the next level of emotional satisfaction. I give it 4/5, a blockbuster with some of the coolest and most imaginative action that I have seen this year."

","One of summer's most anticipated movies is finally here, Del toro's Pacific Rim. This is a movie little boys imagine when they are young, playing in their sandbox. It's quite easy to see why Del Toro was attracted to such a film. It clearly shows in this film and I don't think many directors could handle a film such as this with such love and dedication to their craft. Del Toro really knows what audiences want. So is Pacific Rim his best film? No defiantly not, not even close. Is it at least a great film? No it's not. Pacific Rim however is entertainment at it's finest. It's difficult for me to rate a film like this . Pacific Rim has flaws. The human characters are pretty much awful, and the movie is cheesy as hell. I must also say 3 characters in this movie were probably some of the worst characters I have ever seen in a film. The main female, and the two scientists were just awful. However the real star of this film is the giant robots and the evil monsters. Del Toro knows how to entertain an audience and by god does he do it here. The action is fantastic and does not get to crazy like some Transformers movies do. This is the type of movie where you need to have your brain off and just be entertained. If you hate movies like this, then don't even bother checking this out, but if you have watched similar films and enjoyed them, then you will be all over this. Pacific Rim manages to be original and familiar at the same time. However because of Del Toro's fantastic direction and storytelling it's easy to overlook Pacific Rim's failures. This one redeems the mediocre summer films. Rating: on a film reviewers scale i would say 7.5 out of 10. However it's Del Toro i'm biased and above all rounding up to a solid 8 out of 10. Final Rating: 8 out of 10"

The characters were one dimensional and watching this movie I felt like I was watching 2 10 year old Asian kids play fight with their toy robots. Boring! I would of had more respect for the film if they didn't try so hard to create interesting characters...the fact that they did try and failed just aggravated me even more. Not to mention that the science behind every aspect of the movie was laughable. A hole in the middle of the pacific that water doesn't fall through, but 200 foot tall monsters come out of with increasing frequency. Huh? Mankind's best defense against these monsters is to build equally large robots to fight them? Why not go with a biological or chemical attack...it works so well when humans do it to each other! In addition the robots can only be controlled by 2 people whose brains must (inexplicably) be linked together? I felt like someone took a poop in my hat an made me wear it."

","Do you remember what it was like to experience wonder, as a child, at the flickering images on the screen. You didn't know that's what they were back then, or that the odd plot contrivance was just that and could mean the world (internet trolling didn't exist yet...). It was imperfect, but honest, immersive fun.<br/><br/>This is the virtue of the nostalgic underdog film. A film that smells an untapped niche and goes on a joyful rampage through it. I think it's fair to say the original Indiana Jones did just that, revive childhood memories to create a roller-coaster devoid of cynicism. Gremlins did it. More recently, District 9 did it too.<br/><br/>The Summer of 2013 gave us many examples of modern cinema at its worst: the cynical exploitation of childhood memories, evident in one sub-par reboot/remake after another. Action cinema as a whole has been aching from an emphasis on noise and scale rather than emotion and choreography (not just of action, but design and movement, both within and before the camera). It helps to have the new film of an earnest, geeky master to look forward to.<br/><br/>Enter Guillermo Del Toro. Enter Pacific Rim. And here, hidden under a confused marketing campaign, is what we've been waiting for. A film that balances respectful nostalgia with irreverence (something Transformers and Man of Steel did all wrong in their respective extremes), a film that makes you remember what it was like to be a kid again. Rather than washed-out, fast-cut chaos, we get a neon-colored ballet of destruction through locations and between creatures and robots that scream the love of their creators in every frame.<br/><br/>It's a silly film brilliantly made, and just when you wonder whether it isn't throwing certain tropes of its genre at you too literally - whether it be certain sub-stellar performances, mainly from leading man Charlie Hunman, a often predictable plot, etc. - it surprises you with a moment of sheer beauty. <br/><br/>It makes you remember what it was like to be amazed, and it makes you hope. That the Kaiju genre is back for good. That people continue shoveling money at Guillermo Del Toro. That his Hellboy III and Mountains of Madness get made. That we see more of the great Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi, not to mention Mana Ashida (showcased here in a phenomenal flashback scene).<br/><br/>A solid 9, no question about it."

","This is the best blockbuster movie of the year so far. Watched in 2d so cant comment on 3d version. Excellent story, simple and not too overcomplicated, with obvious major nods to manga/anime influence. Basically its all about monsters vs giant robots fighting and you get plenty of that! No slow build up, straight into the action. Characters typical clichéd bunch with tragic back stories, but reasonably well done so matches the story. And a few eccentric characters very typical of Del Toro. Very much like typical Michael Bay OTT film but Del Toro influence raises it above this. Only niggles is that some of the action shown very close up and dark so maybe not getting the best out of the fights, but that is the style of the film. And as with many blockbusters, the sound effects sometimes seem to swamp the dialogue. Also film feels bit rushed could actually do with another 20 mins. But all that is very minor. After a good year for sf films with iron Man 3, Star Trek and Man of Steel, and Elysium still to come, this is even better. See it in the cinema, this is the place to watch it!

It had been so long since a film totally immersed me in its world. I felt a chill down my spine as the jeager and kaijus first took screen. The CGI is outstanding and undoubtedly deserves the Oscar for it.<br/><br/>The action? My God, the action. Transformers, take notes. If you want to make a tense, exciting battle scene, actually show what's going on and make the enemy actually dangerous. These Kaiju meant business so every skirmish was a heart pounding experience for me. The fact that the CGI was so convincing only enhanced this.<br/><br/>Let me get this out of the way. I do not think this film is as stupid or badly acted as many other people do. In fact, I quite liked the leads, especially Mako. I felt this film did a good job developing their characters and building their friendship. The story is of course not spectacular. I'm not saying the acting is stellar either, but it's by no means bad. But this movie has heart.

","I haven't really seen a good movie like this in a long time. It kept me on the edge of my seat to where I couldn't sit still. What kept me from giving it a perfect 10 is because of the swear words used in it. I have known from long time observation that any time swear words put in a movie ruins it from being watched over and over; as a result, it won't be a timeless masterpiece. Swear words used in a movie is usually to cover up poor story plot, character development and or weak dialogue. I hope the creators of this movie will remove such and use more creative ways of expressing. I have recognized like some of where Pacific Rim is like Independence Day. What this show seems to be saying, if any, is we can't use conventional means of warfare when we are up against something much bigger than any normal wars on earth and that threats to humanity doesn't have to always come from space when they could be deep within our own back yard for years. The only characters I liked best in the movie were played by Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam. Even though they were probably suppose to be the comedy side in the movie, I didn't care for the two weak nerdy intelligent characters who ended up doing a scientific mind meld with the alien creatures.

And it did to some extent. At first, I thought I've seen all these characters before. And I had. At first, I thought the CGI looked silly (hadn't seen the good parts yet) at times. I thought the soundtrack was vapid. I don't know where in the movie exactly I lost all my gripes and negativity. Possibly when I saw A GIANT ROBOT BEATING A GIANT SEA MONSTER IN THE HEAD WITH A GIANT THING (won't spoil it for you). Even the soundtrack got me excited after everything ""clicked"".<br/><br/>Throw your inner critic and inner hipster away to a fiery pit, and embrace this movie as what it is: ""Pacific Rim"" is a pure B-movie and an epitome of power fantasy with phenomenal execution. Remember the old monster/mech movies of the good old times? The ones you'd catch on TV or find from some VHS video store? At its heart ""Pacific Rim"" is exactly like that, only with a huge budget.<br/><br/>Now when I think of the characters, I love how many stereotypes they managed to fit in. We got a Jaeger pilot with a painful history and a personal loss, a dickhead hotshot pilot, a wise older pilot, an excited wannabe pilot, a commander, two funny scientists...it's hilarious. And in a good way. We see overused characters and relationships and for some magical reason, it isn't a bad thing. There's enough story and characters to give a reason for what is happening with some fitting humor as well. <br/><br/>I thought Charlie Hunnam was just OK, never been a huge fan although I do enjoy ""Sons of Anarchy"". Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead, was decent as well. For me the best performances came from Idris Elba who has a magical presence as well as Ron Perlman who is always a joy to watch. Whatever tired lines they may spout, I'm all in and I buy it every time. Max Martini was also one of the more charismatic actors here.<br/><br/>But the real characters...we know who they are, don't we? The Jaegers and the Kaiju(s). In laymen terms: GIANT ROBOTS AND GIANT SEA MONSTERS. And they are truly gigantic. Call me childish, but when I saw these ""main characters"" fighting each other, I was giggling, cheering and pumping my fists with my mouth open. The designs are wonderful, full of personality. Every Jaeger and Kaiju is beautiful and exciting to look at.<br/><br/>And the action itself...I don't know what to say. I mean, I've seen every ""big"" movie there is. I've seen some special effects in my life. But this was phenomenal. I'm at a loss for words. Everything was big and badass, got more big and badass, and even more big and badass than I could've hoped. And the fact that most of the huge battles happen in water just makes everything look that much cooler. The water effects are amazing and the setting really adds a wonderful touch to everything that happens. The sea, the rain, the lights of Jaegers and helicopters...it's like a beautiful, fantastic and violent dance. There is so much attention to detail, so much expression with angles, colors and light that I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it in huge-scaled fantasy action movie before. The more I watch it, the more I'm impressed. Visually, eleven out of ten. <br/><br/>Let's get some tired comparisons out of the way. This is not Transformers, even though both have giant robots. That's where the similarities end. Also on the huge-scaled action department, what ""Transformers"" didn't do right for me, this film really did. Same with the horrible ""Battleship"", it annoyed me as a whole more than it did anything else. <br/><br/>This movie on the other hand got me. Guillermo Del Toro does love this genre, and it really shows. There is a heart in this film. It's a childish heart, but it's also an honest heart. Without that certain love and respect for the old pioneers, ""Pacific Rim"" wouldn't have been this impressive. Luckily it is.<br/><br/>No false pretences here, no shoe-horned subplots that serve no purpose, no political messages either. Only giant creatures punching each other to death in a war of two worlds, and a satisfying ending on top of it. <br/><br/>""Pacific Rim"" is possibly the most expensive B-movie ever made. And for me it is worth it. Thank you for this, mister Del Toro. My inner child is still giggling like an idiot. He certainly got his fix."

","A visual treat, I must say and a fairly good movie. Seriously I expected something bigger from the director who made me believe that fairy tales could be serious in Pan's Labyrinth. The movie certainly is bigger technically but falls behind novelty. Everybody has known transformers, battleship etc.., and not again with this combats. I've seen these animated combats way before in 1998 when I played metal fatigue game. Actors did a fair job sailing along the script and I disagree with the other reviewer who was telling that actors were bad. The first 10 minutes was excellent and I felt like 'm gonna see something like District 9 but the movie lost pace in the middle and got highly predictable (something like a lunch with a good soup and a bad main course). The bottom line is that the movie is visually appealing with nicely written dialogs to match but falls behind any new essence."

","If you want some uber fantastic CGI, action packed, monster pounding, rockets blasting, loud booms and explosions then you'll love this movie because it does that VERY well. If you're expecting a deep and well crafted story, you'll be a bit disappointed. The strong point of this movie is the struggle of the human race against all odds. The courage, bravery, and comradery that everyone has to go through to make it together. It displays a lot of inspirational moments and makes you remember who you are as a human being, weak and fragile. We may not be much alone but together we can overcome anything. An inspirational action packed robots and aliens movie in summary. Not a romantic or a movie filled with plots and twists. Movie is obviously geared towards younger audiences."

","This was an overall great action sci-fi flick. I absolutely loved the CGI and fight scenes, especially those underwater! Highly recommended to anyone who likes a decent story line with mediocre character development. Very little sexual nature to this film, but loads of violence. My concern with the film and story, is that there wasn't much detail spent in the early days of the Jaegers, or better yet the full stages of the kaiju. I believe that if Pacific Rim had been made into a television show (perhaps even better if it happened now!) showcasing each kaiju battle and follow around the crews of each Jaeger, that a lot more people could enjoy the wonderful idea behind the film and story itself. But hey, it's just an idea"

","Bad... Very bad. Bad Acting, Bad Story, even the CGI effects which you would expect to be good seemed to consist of mainly badly modeled robots splashing about in a sea of Gray and blocks of concrete or cars flying about. I am guessing the effects were made to emphasize the 3D experience, unfortunately it only emphasized how bad it all was.<br/><br/>As this is a mainly CGI driven film I have to compare the cgi with things like the transformer films which although not great films in their own right were nowhere near as bad as this turkey. <br/><br/>I should point out I am an utter scifi/cgi fan but I watched the whole thing hoping that things would get better but they didn't, and sorry to say but this over hyped film really disappointed."
"kmcnab","1","30","63","13 July 2013"," Breathtakingly bad.
","I only have myself to blame. I saw the trailer and was seduced by the whole ""Giant Robots fight Giant Aliens"" concept, and Del Toro's record. But to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.<br/><br/>I came very close to walking out. And the only other time I've done that is watching Adam Sandler's ""Don't Mess With The Zohan"". That's how bad it is.<br/><br/>Visually, it's on a huge scale and is nothing you've seen before. It deserves some plaudits for that. Rinko Kikuchi put in a decent performance (at least when compared to her fellow cast members)<br/><br/>But the poor acting, cringe-worthy dialogue, lazy characterisation, sad attempts at ""comic relief"", incoherent storyline and gaping plot holes do not make up for the cool effects. And to be honest, after the first 20 minutes or so, you kind of know what you're going to get for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I know it's a big blockbusting summer popcorn movie, and I usually LOVE that stuff. But this was lazy. When 95% of your time is on the effects and 5% is on the rest, you're going to get a crappy film, and that's exactly what you get here."
"lilguyollie","9","9","15","1 August 2013"," Much better than anticipated
","We all saw the trailers early on and perceived this to be an adults version of power rangers. Whether that sounded good or not to you, it's still worth watching. Don't be put off by the lack of big name actors in this movie as this proves that the reputation of an actor does not men they will make the film good, also proved by The Lone Ranger.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim's premise is that giant dinosaur like creatures called Kaijus are attacking the countries which surround the Pacific Rim, which contains a portal which leads to the Kaijus dimension. To combat this, the UN pooled their resources together to create giant robots known as Jaegers to fight them. The Kaijus begin to evolve and with the UN losing faith in the Jaegers, they make one last stitch attempt to permanently deal with the Kaijus.<br/><br/>Starting as always with the positive points, everyone in the film provides an A plus performance. Maybe it's because we expect the acting to be mediocre due to the emphasis on CGI and the lack of big name actors. Maybe this would make us look at this and think it's much better than I thought it would be. But no it's just plain good. The CGI is marvellous, as are the fight scenes and both combined is just as colossally gorgeous as the monsters. Whilst the story isn't as engaging or stimulating we would expect, especially from Mr del Toro, the ending is still satisfying and leaves room for a possible sequel. As an added point i'd like to ask how the hell did Grown Ups 2 beat this movie at the box office? because basically that film is bloody awful.<br/><br/>Overall, it's like this concept was purposely drawn up for Michael Bay just so that he can have a CGI vacation with this. However, the story is still engrossing ad the action and acting keeps the viewer in the moment and excited. If you're action fans, you will love it and if you are fans of a deep, twist filled storyline you will learn to appreciate it. Basically, if you are reading this, Go see this movie. Like now."
"nonprofitgnome1","8","9","15","25 July 2013"," Not Your Average Robot Movie
","Pacific Rim was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. With a great director like Guillermo Del Toro, a fun cast with Idris Elba and Charlie Day, and monsters vs kaiju; hyped was an understatement. The movie almost lived up to its hype but unfortunately had its flaws.<br/><br/>The movie is all about the human's war with the Kaiju (monsters from the ocean). To combat these monsters, society creates monsters of their own. The movie doesn't try and be anything more than that, a vehicle for monster vs monster combat.<br/><br/>As expected, Del Toro delivers when it comes to one of the most stunning fight scenes I have ever seen. You could have put the middle fight scene from Pacific Rim into the middle of Batman and Robin and I'm still giving it a good score. I also enjoyed the performances by Idris Elba and Ron Perlman.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were a few negatives. Firstly, the acting was just OK. Aside from Elba and Perlman, there weren't really any great performances. The scientists definitely overacted and the rest were just pedestrian. This wasn't a huge issue as I didn't come for the human interaction, I came for mecha carnage.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing with the movie was the ending. It's not that the final fight scene wasn't great in itself; it's just that it couldn't live up to the fight scene in the middle of the movie in the streets of Tokyo. The ending was a bit anti-climactic.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of great action you can't go wrong with this movie. If you're a fan of mecha anime you can't go wrong with this movie. If you're a fan of Del Toro's you can't go wrong with this movie. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen, you won't regret it."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","9","15","12 July 2013"," Great Throwback to Giant Monster Films
","Pacific Rim (2013) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's latest is a grand throwback to the days when Godzilla and other large monsters stalked the screens. Set in the future, the Earth comes under attack by giant sea monsters so they create giant robots controlled by two pilots so that they can be destroyed. It doesn't take long for the monsters to recapture the upper hand and as time on Earth is running out the humans must come up with a new plan of attack. PACIFIC RIM isn't a masterpiece but it's about as good as a film like this can get. While there are a couple flaws to be found along the way, there's still no way to deny that this here is pure entertainment from start to finish. Obviously del Toro knows his genre so fans will see all sorts of winks to earlier movies but the director takes it to the next level and really delivers something that is a lot of fun and full of wonderful action. I'm one who usually speaks against CGI not because of the technique but because so many directors don't know how to properly use it. That's certainly not the case here because the monsters, the robots and the broken down and destroyed cities all look real. This here is very important because it allows one to really connect with everything that's going on on the screen. Another major plus here is that the action scenes are full of wonderful imagination. The battle sequences are usually long, very destructive and oh so much fun and this includes a rather amazing sequence at the end that's underwater. The performances are also quite good with Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff and especially Idris Elba all fitting their roles nicely. Ron Perlman also has a nice supporting bit. As I said, I think there were a couple flaws with one being the running time, which I felt was a bit too long as ten or fifteen-minutes off would have helped things. There were also a few too many shots that were extremely close to the action to the point where you can't get the full view of all the destruction going on. Still, PACIFIC RIM is a great throwback to the early monster films and it's fun from the word go."
"ecander-erik","8","8","13","24 September 2013"," Pacific Rim Review
","Guillermo Del Toro's Pacific Rim is a movie that the 10 year old in all of us wants to see. The film is action packed and what makes this movie even more awesome is that a majority of the fight scenes are between giant robots and giant aliens. While the acting wasn't the greatest in Pacific Rim, the special effects and originality of the story overcome the bad acting to make an awesome film that is fun for all ages.<br/><br/>Before getting into these intense action scenes, the film first develops a backstory that explains to the audience what is happening. There are these gigantic monsters that are known as Kaiju (Japanese for ""monster"") and they are invading Earth via a portal that is located deep in the Pacific Ocean (hence the name of the film). In order to combat these the nations of the world work together to build giant robots known as Jaegers (German for ""hunter"") and these are piloted by two people (three in one robot) whose minds are melded in ""the Drift"". With the Jaegers the Kaiju are becoming less of a threat, so much so that they are turned into toys. It isn't until the Kaiju become stronger and appear more frequently that the real story begins.<br/><br/>The film suffered a bit from the acting. While the performances from Idris Elba, Ron Perlman, Charlie Day, and to some extent Burn Gorman, were phenomenal, many others were not. Idris Elba's acting really stands out in the film. Many of the other performances, especially Charlie Hunnam, were pretty bad and almost cringe-worthy. Many of the lines that come out of Charlie Hunnam's mouth are just terrible, not only in terms of the actual lines, but also the way that he says them. Two of his lines that come up immediately in the film, ""Tendo. What's happening my man?"" and ""You're gonna get your ass kicked"" are not only lame lines, but the way that he says them is very monotonous and it's impossible to infer any emotion from them. He's about to go out and fight a Kaiju and it's impossible to tell how the character is feeling. Even his facial expressions are bland, I couldn't tell whether what he was feeling at any point during the movie. Fortunately, not all of the acting is as bad as Hunnam's. Idris Elba is probably the film's best actor and it really shows in his character Stacker Pentecost. Right before the major battle in the film, when Elba gives his ""canceling the Apocalypse"" speech not only does he sound inspiring, but you can even see the emotion in his facial expressions. During that speech I couldn't help but get pumped to kick some alien butt.<br/><br/>The entire film relies on the look of the Kaiju and Jaegers; fortunately, Del Toro spared no expense on the special effects and this is where the film really shines. It becomes evident in the first 10 minutes of the film that the special effects are outstanding. Unlike other movies that rely heavily on special effects (see Transformers) the special effects in ""Pacific Rim"" are perfect. Even in the dark rainy fight sequences it is still possible to understand what is going on and who is fighting who. While the fight sequences in ""ransformers were confusing and overfilled with explosions, the fight scenes in Pacific Rim are intense, but easy to comprehend.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim, although it isn't going to win any Oscars, it still is an extremely enjoyable movie. The acting and script aren't extraordinary by any means, but that wasn't to be expected seeing what the movie is about. What really makes the movie are the special effects. By going into it expecting to see intense fight scenes between giant robots and aliens one can't but be impressed by the film."
"Aaron1375","9","8","13","28 July 2013"," If I had seen this as a child, I would have messed myself because of the excitement
","There were certain things I enjoyed as a child. One was giant monster movies such as Godzilla and another were giant robots. So this movie would have been right up my alley. It still is something I wanted to see as it is also very anime like in the way it plays out. It has an anime inspired look and also add the Guillermo Del Toro factor and you end up with one very cool action movie featuring giant mechanized robots fighting huge monsters that were even given the name they have in Japan, Kaiju. Granted, it was not perfect as the look of the film was spectacular and the action grand, the story just was a bit to by the numbers and the acting at time serviceable and at other times a bit like they were not being directed to do nothing more than to open and close their mouths. Still, Del Toro is more of a visual director in my view as I enjoy the first two Blade films equally, liking the first one's story better, but liking the overall style and look of the second better (Del Toro's).<br/><br/>The story has the earth under assault. Some sort of rift has appeared in the Pacific Ocean and huge beasts are coming through causing havoc. At first, it is believed to be an isolated incident, but it turns out that these things keep coming. The earth reacts by building huge robots called Jaegers to combat this monsters. The Jaegers turn the tide momentarily, but the monsters that come through keep getting bigger and adapt their fighting style. A man who used to partner with his brother, piloting a Jaeger called the Gypsy Danger is working on a wall that is being erected to stop the Kaiju as the Jaegers and their pilots are being killed at an ever increasing rate. This man lost his brother and now is asked to team up and pilot the Gypsy Danger for one more mission to close the rift and stop the Kaiju from entering our world.<br/><br/>Like I said, the film has great visuals and that is the star of the piece. So much so that I still give the film a nine despite the many flaws with the story. The robots look good and the monster pretty cool too as one of the monsters near the end even sprouts wings and resembles the Gamera nemesis Gyaos. However, I wish they did a bit more to make the monsters look a bit more distinct as the robots look all different, but the monsters tended to resemble one another. Still, there are some great fights and as I said with a Del Toro film it is usually the visuals that are the highlight and they do not disappoint here.<br/><br/>So a fun movie to watch, at one point the pilot of the Gypsy Danger activates a rocket on the arm to make the robot punch harder and I was thinking ""Rocket Punch!"" from an anime I had seen as a kid. If they could have added a bit more humor to the film it would have been a near perfect film for me. The ending was a bit to predictable too. Overall, the experience was satisfying and I am a bit sad to see this film not doing better at the box office here as I would love to see a sequel mainly due to curiosity in how it would play out. So a very nice film, to bad it did not come out when I was younger."
"evan-lodge","7","8","13","18 July 2013"," Now that's good entertainment.
","I'll keep it short because i just stepped out of the theater and i want to jot down my thoughts quickly. I loved almost everything about this movie. The acting was good, the CGI was incredible as was the scale of the Jaegars and Kaiju and the fight scenes were extraordinary, I loved the director's decision to start the movie in the middle of the war rather than the beginning, the script was good. The film does a great way of explaining important things, such as why the Jaegers need two pilots or why the Kaiju attack in the first place. I think my favorite part is the two scientists. However, there were one or two subplots that seemed clichéd such as the relationship between Mako and the lead guy whose name escapes me. It seems almost reminiscent of a buddy cop drama/comedy. That being said, it's executed very well and the chemistry of the two is wonderful. The music was exhilarating but really that's all it does, as far as i can tell it just seems to be generic electronic action music. Entertaining, but not really something that stands out. <br/><br/>All in all, an excellent movie from Guillermo Del Toro. Think of it as Transformer's more intelligent brother."

","""The Pacific line"" is very pleased with me as a summer blockbuster. Similar premiere last year only disappointing at best just left a good impression. Recall the ""Battleship"" with a great start and sunken finale. ""Oblivion"" was worthy of a fantasy, but without claiming to be religious. I can not believe that the script for the ""turn of the Pacific"" was written by Travis Beacham, who also labored over the ""Battle of the Titans"", where the actual battle of the titans I never saw. I saw a real battle today, where huge robots fighting with monstrous monsters from a parallel universe. That's really the scale!<br/><br/>From the first frame of the movie is steeped in history which began the extermination of humanity. There are no mysteries with a spectacular appearance in ""Godzilla."" All at once simple and clear. Elaborate figures as monsters and robots are staggering. Contractions are varied and unpredictable. The brain is not overloaded due to blurred shots when the huge devastation. Highly developed and detailed interiors, detailed drawing of the robot-rangers. From the point of view of all the pictures are just perfect.<br/><br/>Also, the story does not disappoint. In principle, most of the predictable, but Guillermo del Toro tried to make the audience does not get bored while watching. That was it. Really looks the same breath. The acting for the sci-fi movie with a plot very worthy.<br/><br/>Music sets the mood for epic. You feel the imminent end of humanity. In general, an adequate response to the recent zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>8 out of 10<br/><br/>P.S. Most worried about the Japanese girl with the red shoes."

And yes the effects are spectacular and yes it is 'Godzilla fighting Transformers' so should be every kid born before the 1990s dream film. if you like that sort of thing fill your boots. However there are a few minor niggles that confused me a little, such as why do they stop building these giant machines and then build a wall? You have just seen these alien monsters walk through several very large steel buildings without breaking stride and then someone says lets build a wall to stop them, no weapons are added to this wall its just a big wall..... That seems very stupid if you ask me and I am proved correct when a wall is breached within 2 minutes. Also where do they get all this steel, titanium etc from?

"pongigmon","7","6","9","29 July 2013"," Every child's dream came true! An exuberant performance!
","Usually, these blockbusters are merely eye popper in trailers and never live up with the expectation. I have to say I didn't think this would be the exception before I went to watch the robots combating the monsters from deep down the ocean. I also had a few questions in mind beforehand and the reasons depicted in the film is sensible for audience to fantasize how the two pilots control the robot 'Jaeger' with their simultaneous movement of the body. It's critical for the two pilots to have mutual understanding under the neural bridge technology to enable them to activate the impeccable 'Jaeger'.<br/><br/>The movie succeeded to compel me right from the beginning when the protagonist – Raleigh Becket, played by Charlie Hunnam lost his fellow pilot who is also his brother during the battle with the sea monster which they called Kaiju. This scene shows how tough it is for the human race to clash against an invincible extraterrestrial force and the danger posed to be in a 'Jaeger'. The scene has well set up as the prologue of the story and briefly insinuates that the war is yet to come.<br/><br/>One of the great thing about this movie is that every characters in the story have their highs and lows and you could sense their joy and agony throughout the movie. All the characters have a different story behind them which makes what they are and how they stride against the global doom. Rinko Kikuchi who plays Mako Mori is a Japanese girl adopted by the Marshall at adolescent when Japan was under attack. The character is sophisticated with love and hate throughout the film, the affection she shows toward her fellow partner Raleigh and her appreciation, respect to her foster parent Marshall Stacker Pentecost played by Idris Elba. Her rage and hope for vengeance grows as she lost her parents during childhood which cause her to trapped in the past and become a major concern for Stacker. Idris Elba has provided a powerful performance in the movie and the character is gradually unveiled, from a strict superior to a compassionate father who is willing to make sacrifice and devote himself to the public. The relationship between these major characters is complex which gives a lot more depth to the story.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, one thing to take a note of is the flawless visual effect which is literally sublime in my point of view. The scene which is sited in Hong Kong is simply ravishing, the two forces collide in the dazzling cityscape crammed with skyscrapers, it has further amplify the effect and the colossal impact these alien force would have cause. You would sense that the apocalypse is actually coming and the world is in despair that it will come to an end.<br/><br/>It's every child's dream to watch the gigantic robot wrestling against monsters from outer space, if you are a big fan of anime by any chance, you're going to love this movie. It's blatant that the movie has taken some reference from the anime comic book with the style of monster and robots appear in the film. The influences of the robot combat scenes from Tranzor Z, Gundam or Neon Genesis Evangelion is crucial in shaping this film. Guillermo del Toro has done a magnificent job to give audience an intoxicating encounter between the mankind and the alien monstrous creature. It's an action packed, exuberant performance overall and a blockbuster that is worth watching indeed!"
"hkauteur","8","6","9","27 July 2013"," HK Auteur Review - Pacific Rim
","As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.<br/><br/>The fights are the main attraction. You either go along with that premise or not, there's no two ways about it. In reality, it's probably more resourceful to bomb these giant monsters or shoot them with a very big cannon, instead of making giant robots to punch them to death. But where's the fun in that? Suffice to say, the fights are a tense visceral experience and the scale of everything delivers an epic sense of awe. They do everything to up the ante and surprise the audience. Special moves are only used in climatic moments and there's just something about a giant robot using a boat as a bat that's just hilarious and jaw-dropping. These fights run very dangerously to the cinematic equivalent of watching somebody play a video game. That's why I like the drifting mind meld concept, because it solves that problem by it properly adding both physical and emotional conflict to the pilots controlling the Jaegers as well. It focuses to how well these pilots are controlling the Jaegers as opposed to how the Jaegers are fighting the Kaijus.<br/><br/>The fights are shot somewhat tightly but for a very good reason. Shooting the fights close holds the tension and injects the sense of jeopardy and stake into every exchange in the fight choreography. I imagine if the fights were covered entirely in long wide shots, it would lose that sense of scale and the fights would look silly. That said, I had no problem following what's going on because emotionally it felt right to be watching them that way. And personally, it was doubly fun that the film was set in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>There's been a common complaint that the characters lacked development, I disagree. Basically these people all have baggage and they have to band together as a team or fall apart. The film spends time building arcs for its ensemble cast, and it's sufficient to justify the epic robot monster fights. That's it, so I don't understand that complaint. Adding neat little quirks or oddball idiosyncrasies to these characters would have been overkill.<br/><br/>The dialogue is one of the film's weaker portions. However, depending on how well each actor was able to milk the lines, I was still able to have fun with it. I couldn't stop cackling at Charlie Day's fast-paced high-pitched deliveries, who rises above being ""Dr. Exposition"" and balances the film with comic relief. Day's exchange with the rival math-based scientist played by Burn Gorman is essentially a cartoon-level quarrel equivalent to Daffy Duck arguing with Bugs Bunny. The math Gorman's scientist applies is is grade-school at best. Ron Perlman facetiously entertains in flying colors as the Kaiju body parts black marketer Hannibal Chau, the most asshole character name ever created. Idris Elba also adds significant weight as the team leader. So for me, the side characters take the cake from the Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi storyline, which was played very straight for story purposes.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is aware of current big-budget blockbuster tropes and differentiates himself from those trends in Pacific Rim. There are no homage or geek references to distract or alienate the audience. Rinko Kikuchi's Mako character is not sexualized or filmed through a salivating male gaze; she is a real human character with a story and treated as such. The film doesn't play like a military recruitment advertisement nor has any blatant nationalistic or jingoistic intentions. Perhaps one of my favorite things about Pacific Rim is it tonally divorces itself from post-9/11 sentimentality. The world has its own distinct fictional reality, where destruction is not linked by evoking imagery, memories or emotions from September 11th. Civilians evacuate from buildings, hide in shelters and the streets are clear for the Jaegers to bash the Kaijus. Most importantly, del Toro never dwells heavily on despair or hopelessness and the audience can enjoy the city-wide destruction guilt-free. All those things counted together, Pacific Rim is truly a breath of fresh air amidst current blockbuster aesthetics and a film made with the most earnest intentions.<br/><br/>Without an A-list star, a love story or a recognizable established franchise (i.e. Godzilla or Transformers) , it's not hard to see why Pacific Rim didn't score at the box office. As Snakes On A Plane proved at its theatrical release, the geek fan base doesn't represent much of the core population. The geeks merely are just the most vocal. Perhaps other parts of the demographic are alienated just by the material itself, despite that del Toro is aiming to entertain everybody. If there's one underdog movie people should give a chance to this summer, let it be Pacific Rim. It's a passionate earnest film made by a director that loves the material and wants to deliver good clean fun with a positive message for everybody. His attention to every little detail exudes his excitement for the material; that passion rubbed off on me and elevated my enjoyment. It's the most fun I've had watching a movie this summer. Guillermo del Toro, give me a hug!<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit and subscribe to my blog - http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"

","I watched this because it looked badass; I'll be honest. <br/><br/>First off, let me say that this movie has some of the best graphics and visuals of any film in history to date. The fight scenes in this, during 2013, are like when you watched Jurassic Park in the mid 90s. It's just so good, so amazing, on a godlike scale, that it gets at least an 8/10 fresh out the gate.<br/><br/>The story is pretty cool, but the family angle is played at a little bit, so some cheesy stuff is in the mix (girl like boy, boy has a bully rival, boy fight rival for girl, boy get girl). But it actually is badass how the overall story is made somehow acceptable. It is like Avatar - super far fetched, but everything is logical and in order, so you completely buy it.<br/><br/>Everything was amazing, you have to see it if you like any movies at all. Only reason I didn't give it a 10, was because the writing could perhaps have been a little better. There was a scene with a 5-10 minute hand to hand battle between a giant alien monster, and one of the human guided Voltrons. Blow for blow, it is like a Mike Tyson fight. And then literally, when Voltron is about to lose the fight, one of the Voltron pilots says something like ""Oh yea, we have this giant sword that can pop out of the arm"".... and it does, and they kill the alien with one swing... Things like that, are not necessary evils that blockbusters with simple plot lines must lug around - that's what they want us to think. Good writing can always tie a fictional story together.<br/><br/>But you can get past that - and you will, because it still is so far beyond 99% of all movies ever made, that you will permanently see life differently after watching it."

He can't play relentless hero. It's just not him. This movie has some great effects and decent back story, but he can't (at least for now), play the main roles similar to these ones. Loved Charlie Day and Ron Perlman (but I like them in every movie), though they seem too out of place. If this movie was shot in ""Batman"" style, it would have been much better.

A ton of fun, great characters, amazing visual effects, a story that doesn't fall under clichés. That's basically it in a nutshell, and the actual story stands-out from all of these seemingly formulaic and predictable blockbusters. I was hesitant about Charlie Hunman (although I remember him from Undeclared, much skinnier back then though) but he was a pretty great leading man and I have high hopes for his future. Del Toro nailed it with this, and hope he continues to give us more mainstream-fare."

Tough to say, but seems like people didn't want to watch it at that time, so maybe the release date was off.<br/><br/>You can't tell with those things though, so I'm pretty sure this will do much better once it hits the video stores/markets and sells/rents like crazy.

"popandcrackcorn","8","7","11","26 August 2013"," Pacific Rim- a 10 year old's review
","Guillermo Del Toro's Pacific Rim is one of those movies that shouldn't have worked. The plot feels like an elongated episode of the Power Rangers, the climax is as predictable as your stomach after a sack full of Krystals, the acting is decent at best, the character development is almost non-existent, and the back story is more reminiscent of the NES classic Rampage than a movie that will go down as one of the best movies of 2013. But I loved it, every single moment of it. <br/><br/>It was fantastic, and shows how a dominant director like Del Toro can take a theme that is so ingrained in our childhood psyche, as he has done with every movie he's ever made, and turn it into gold. Pacific Rim can be summed up in three magically beautiful words, words that bring me back to all the pictures I doodled in elementary school when I was supposed to be bettering my education and future career options. Three words that make my heart beat fast and convince me that as a people, we are all internally good and our future is hopeful. <br/><br/>Robots versus monsters. Now take a moment and let your imagination run free.<br/><br/>The basic story line of Pacific Rim is there is a planet far, far away that is sending Cloverfield-style monsters (any of which would've been better than the actual Cloverfield monster) known as the Kaiju to our shores to kill us all through a portal in the ocean. After the first few, we decided to come up with an initiative to battle them, called the Jaeger Program. This plan consists of building massive robots called Jaegers, which are controlled internally by humans, to defend us from the oncoming creatures. Since one brain can't handle the overall input needed to command these massive robots, it takes two brains to sync for a successful compatibility. Our lead protagonist Raleigh Beckett (Sons of Anarchy's Charlie Hunnam) and his brother Yancey become one the first really successful pairings in their Jaeger named 'Gypsy Danger'. But soon things go bad and eventually Raleigh quits the force to become a construction worker for no understandable reason. Eventually he's brought back when most of the Jaegers have been wiped out due to the relentless attacks by the Kaiju, and then spoilers happen.<br/><br/>There's more of course, but that's enough to make the ten year old inside of go giddy. However that's the same ten year old who begged for Sea Monkeys and a Power Glove, so I have to remain subjective as there were many things wrong with Pacific Rim. <br/><br/>For instance, the basic plot of gigantic robots fighting monsters is obviously awesome in theory, but has been done many, many times without much success, unless you're from Japan or the director of Robot Warriors. Also the character development feels thrown in at the last moment, as some major characters have either very little or completely random plot points, e.g. Stacker Pentecost's (the talented Idris Elba) past with Jaegers or Del Toro favorite Ron Perlman who shows up mid- movie without any background. Furthermore there's not a lot of explanation as to the Kaiju, apart from a five minute intro that explains about forty minutes of back story.<br/><br/>But it's in this vagueness that Pacific Rim manages to actually work, which is incredible. By not focusing too much on the plot development or characters themselves, the viewer is allowed to concentrate more on the main point of the film, i.e. robots fighting giant aliens. And in that aspect, Del Toro does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are incredible, with stunning graphics that prove our CGI capabilities have finally reached levels that would make Ed Wood angry. There isn't a moment when you aren't fully immersed, as the details that went into the battles are so minute. Whether it's the waves splashing against the metal robots or the muscle movement of the Kaiju, the viewer is constantly captivated and never disassociates from the action. Pacific Rim really is the epitome of a movie that you need to see in the theaters, understanding full well that it cost $55 minimum to take a date who's got candy and cokes stuffed in her purse. <br/><br/>Leave work and go see Pacific Rim right now, as it's more satisfying than a job. Your ten year old self will thank you, because he/she is probably still angry that all that came in the mail was brine shrimp."
"s_campanale","8","7","11","13 August 2013"," Del Toro's classic Anime and Kaiju homage is Gold for the fans but may leave non-fans perplexed at the multi-plex
","I admit I've been very excited about this movie since the first posters & trailers appeared, mainly because I am coming at it from a similar place to Del Toro himself, someone who grew up loving the classic Japanese ""Mecha-Anime"" series which were bigger than God back in the 70s and 80s in Italy, Spain and other Latin countries (and who is also a big fan of their forbears, the ""man in a monster suit"" Kaiju films). That someone was attempting to make a live action summer blockbuster film based on them was exciting enough, but when that man was the great visionary Del Toro himself, then something really special seemed on the cards.<br/><br/>Of course expectations had to be dampened down, and wisely so. The film's biggest flaw is the plot. In condensing a typical anime series into 2hrs 11 minutes you have to concentrate on just the bare basics, and that makes for a very generic, seen it all before outline. Gone are most of the little sub-plots and character dynamics which gave the originals their quiet poetry, philosophy, humour and tragedy, and in their place is the standard ""maverick rejected by others –pissing contest-learning to work together-taking the enemy down with desperate last plan"" arc. If you're familiar with the originals then you can pretty much mentally fill in the blanks. If you're not then it's going to look very thin and underwhelming. It reminded me a lot of 1999's ""Wing Commander"", another retro-styled cheap and cheerful cheesefest.<br/><br/>The cast is also made up of genre archetypes – the lone maverick hero (Hunmann) the traumatised heroine desperate to prove herself and take revenge (Kikuchi), the arrogant jock who doesn't want the lone maverick on the team (Kazinsky) The aloof father figure head of operations (Elba) the pair of comedy bickering scientists (Day and Gorman) and the comical gangster (Perlman) – people who you would never in a million years imagine, nor want, as humanities last line of defence, but who somehow end up that way. In cartoon form it just about works, but in making them flesh and blood, the illusion is totally shattered. The actors, who apart from Elba, Perlman (and Spanish comedian Santiago Segura making another cameo for Del Toro as Perlman's henchman) are largely unknowns, do what they can, but there seems something deliberately false and forced about the acting, as if Del Toro was going for cheese knowingly, a tongue firmly in cheek, always a tricky route to take. The dialogue, which again apes that of the originals, comes off as rather silly, and Elba's grand rousing pre-battle speech sounds just daft.<br/><br/>Kikuchi's traumatic flashbacks to her experience as a child facing an early monster in Tokyo, and her rescue by a young Elba, are a rare but welcome bit of ""depth"" from the originals and in Del Toro's hands comes off very effectively. Similarly the comic side-route by the scientists to find parts of a monster brain to meld with by way of comedy gangster Perlman are funny and welcome.<br/><br/>The film borrows liberally from various series, both anime and live- action ""Kaiju"", both in plot and look. The main story seems borrowed from the classic Getter Robot, in which an underground civilization of fully evolved dinosaurs attempts to take back Earth from newcomers Man by way of huge hybrid dinosaur-cyborg monsters called ""Mecha-Zaus"" which spring up from below the ocean to strike a will. The mythology has been slightly rejigged, and a ""dimensional breech"" idea invented to fill in the obvious credibility gap of having an underground kingdom near the Earth's core. We see a few glimpses of these creatures, and of the monster-building process, but they are totally absent as characters, and so the story suffers. Part of the fun of the originals was having an enemy team, often back-stabbing and infighting for influence among themselves throughout the series course, but here they are unseen, and the Mecha-Zaus just crazed beasts. Other plot elements are borrowed from different series, as are the looks of the ""Jaeger"" robots. The main robot is modelled on the classic Tetsujin-28 (Del Toro's favourite) while the Australian and Chinese robots take their inspiration from the later Macross series, and the heavy tank like Russian robot seems an ode to similar battle suits in ""Gundam"". The piloting process is also updated, with a neuro-link called ""drifting"" whereby two become-one with the robot, and their body movements match up those of the robots. Similar ideas where floated in the originals, with an almost mystical link between pilot and machine, but most controlling was done by pulling various levers around, so this is an improvement on that. It also provides a vital plot point during the second act.<br/><br/>The Kaiju/Mecha-Zaus are also varied (the originals had special teams who worked on creating different enemy monsters/robots every episode) with dragon, gorilla, swordfish, tortoise, alligator and lobster inspired creatures. Each is given a Japanese codename, but sadly their names do not flash up beneath them in Japanese script when they first appear as they did in the originals! The fights are rough and violent, and battle winning weapons are only taken out at the last second for dramatic effect (as in the series) while superficial damage and anguish is visited upon the pilots. Many of the robots shown in posters never appear, while the Russian and Chinese robots, though really built up, are destroyed in seconds in an anti-climactic way.<br/><br/>In many ways this, like earlier live-action anime ""Speed Racer"", was never going to be a big winner, but rather a labour of love to and for a certain crowd. For the non anime/kaiju fan, it can still be a very fun night out, with great effects (The 3D is really used here) a few laughs, light tragedy and plenty of action which mercifully doesn't take itself too seriously. Don't expect too much and you should be entertained."

","Pacific Rim is an amazing visual treat for lovers of CGI and all those amazing graphic jargon I know not of. <br/><br/>The story line is very plain and uncomplicated (I am saying that as a good thing). If you are expecting an Alfred Hitchcock twist of a movie, then you should go find an Alfred Hitchcock movie.<br/><br/>It is simply huge machines against huge monsters. I was skeptical at first, following my disappointment with Transformers (all of them). The machines look amazing! The camera angles are on point and the combat scenes could not have been shot any better. Maybe a little less light could have improved some scenes but overall the movie delivered what it promised to deliver. Stunning graphics. I liked the music and sounds too.<br/><br/>The low points for me were the overused hero clichés and speeches in every movie you see. Additionally I believe Charlie Day's character could have been better. His 'frightened' look was not the best.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, go see the movie expecting nothing mind-blowing (like the Usual Suspects); just something eye-ploding!!!"

","Pacific Rim takes summer block buster movie to it's new level. After a short and vigorous beginning the movie grows bigger than ever seen digital effect rumble. With the length of over two hours the movie is simply eye candy. Guillermo Del Toro holds the story just enough interesting that you can handle all that effect rumble. When all the Transformer movies are just empty digital effect after digital effect Guillermo Del Toro's apocalyptic world is just enough interesting to keep it watchable. Too bad that the story here is so cheesy and it has told so many times in so many different ways. But anyway this turbo loaded effect rumble is quite beautiful to watch. Many times you can see almost see a raindrop to fall from the neck metallic monster. 3D looks great even it hasn't use in every way it could have used. Movie is typical popcorn movie but the trouble here is that it can be too much to most of the viewers. You have to be geek enough to like it. For me there is no trouble to like it and it really is worth of movie ticket price. This movie is a digi-geeks wet daydream, but if you want a good story instead of effect rumble you better to avoid this movie.<br/><br/>***1/2"

","Before I throw my opinion, I just want to say that I was excited for this movie. I'm a huge fan of the anime series Gundam Wing & Big O, so the robots versus aliens had me hooked. I really did enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>I think people didn't give the story aspect enough credit. I thought the setup in the beginning set the stage for the story, and the main plot, though predictable at points, kept the movie from being more than just a CGI fight fest. Charlie Hunnam did a good job as the lead, but I thought Idris Elba & Rinko Kikucho did fantastic. Charlie Day & Burn Gorman, as scientist working with the main cast, did a good job with the comic relief and Ron Perlman was still good as his role as a black market merchant. Major kudos to child actress Mana Ashida, who played a younger version of Rinko Kikucho's character in a flashback sequence, as she was amazing.<br/><br/>The real treat was the action packed battles with the robots (called Jaegers) and the monsters (called Kaijus). This was the kind of movie that needed to be experienced on the big screen and it didn't disappoint. Could I recommend this to anyone....probably not. But if you are a fan of Godzilla type monster movies or mobile suit anime shows mentioned above, I think you will enjoy this movie."
"ksj870","7","7","11","22 July 2013"," Pacifc Rim: Action on a Giant Scale
","Pacific Rim is the latest would-be blockbuster with anger issues. Once again, we have a movie that seems determined to show as much urban destruction as possible. This time, the combatants aren't opposing armies or even superheroes and super villains, but giant troll-like monsters and the equally mammoth robots designed to fight them off.<br/><br/>Director Guillermo del Toro tries hard to distinguish his film from similar movies (Transformers, Avengers, etc) by not only the scale of the action—which is incredible—but moreover by devoting a lot of screen time to the characters behind all the on screen mayhem. The script delves rather deeply into the psyches of our principal heroes, Raleigh and Mako (played by Charlie Hunnam and Riko Kikuchi), a pair of pilots who operate the aforementioned giant robots, and this is a wise move: when their war machine goes toe-to-toe with a ravenous behemoth, we know there's actually someone of flesh and blood inside all that metal. This increases not only viewer empathy but suspense as well. And Raleigh and Mako are genuinely interesting characters. Raleigh is a has-been veteran who may have lost the will to fight, while the winsome rookie Mako simmers with pent-up rage and fear beneath her calm, prim facade.<br/><br/>Though both Hunnam and Kikuchi, as well as the extensive supporting cast (which includes Ron Perlman as a shady businessman who sells monster parts on the black market), are excellent in their roles, the standout performance goes to Idris Elba as the enigmatic Stacker Pentecost. Pentecost is the commander of the world's small army of robotic defenders, a man of iron discipline and penetrating insight who will do anything to defeat the monsters that have crawled up from the ocean's depths. Elba has always been a fine actor, but this is his best showing to date.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim's biggest flaws are a slow middle portion and the fact that the story doesn't do as much with some of its main characters as it could. The script really lets us get to know these men and women as believable individuals, but then loses them in the mechanics of the plot. At 132 minutes, Pacific Rim couldn't have been any longer for theatrical release, but I'd be curious if a future Director's Cut DVD might flesh out some of the subplots that are left dangling in the movie as it now stands.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim isn't far from being a really excellent action film, marred only by the above weaknesses. Those points do hold the film back from true greatness, but it's still a highly entertaining thrill-ride. Where else can you see a giant robot bludgeon a lumbering ogre into submission with a boat?"
"janosy-csaba","1","23","47","13 July 2013"," Dumbest summer blockbuster ever
","From now on, I really doubt that I base my movie watching habits on IMDb ratings. 8 out of 10??? Seriously?? These days I only go to cinema to watch some movies I can't at home, basically 3d movies, and for popcorn. And I really enjoyed World war Z in this category. But this.... this 140 minutes pure pain is below everything i've seen recently. I haven't given 1 out of 10 until now.<br/><br/>How could this movie got 8 points people? It was thrilling? Entertaining? The characters or the story was interesting at all? NO. It wasn't! This is the child of Godzilla and Transformers, and the dumbest child of them.<br/><br/>The storyline was a cliché driven predictable, worthless nothing. Humanity is really that stupid that when we realize these monsters come out of a wormhole in the deep ocean the solution is let's not give a damn about it, build giant robots and containment walls instead. Really? Are We that stupid?! And we examine the carcass scientifically only years after the start of the invasion? Really?<br/><br/>We have the brainless budget Brad Pitt characters and the worst of them too, single-sided, single-minded soldiers. Even the captain or whatever his rank is, (Elba) is great being a jerk that almost every of his subordinates do insubordination and he can keep a straight face about it, nice. All I can hope that not these kind of characters are at the last line of defense in the real world. And the scientists? Where they come from, the most clichéd types of them all. Are they really that dumb, they have to say out loud every idea or revelation they have? Or that is just because to tell the audience everything they think. Not to waste the audiences brain cells for thinking. All we need for this movie is our ears and eyes, not brains.<br/><br/>And yeah CGI is good, it's spectacular and wow and awesome, etc. But for what? Haven't we seen enough CGI already these years. Does this make the story even a tiny bit better? Why don't we want better stories instead. And I know that this is a summer blockbuster but even then World war Z, Star Wars and Matrix was summer movies too. All with good or great story lines. Why don't Hollywood make movies like those? Only remakes and brainless superhero and comic movies...<br/><br/>Wake up little bit people. Even with blockbuster movies demand some good story, some thinking into it, not just CGI, because then it's like just a brainless video game, like COD 9 or something. And no, GlaDOS' voice doesn't make this film any better, go play with Portal instead, this movie does brain damage and wastes 2hours and 20 bucks, don't watch it because this is the true zombie movie, it played by zombies and watched by them too. Only the popcorn was enjoyable. Two thumbs down."
"MisterHOH","5","24","50","16 July 2013"," Pacific Grim.
","Going in with this expectation, you will not be disappointed, but if you think you will have an awe inspiring experience you might have a bad time. I just seen it in IMAX and I have to say that half of the time I couldn't tell what's going on during the fight sequences. I'm not the only one here complaining about this. It is clearly an editing defect and also a color grading defect since everything is too dark during the fights. I do not understand this new trend by splitting the movie in very long and stale sequences and then cut to endless fighting scenes which strain the eye and over-saturates the senses. Just intertwine them up into a more coherent story driven film. It is not rocket science. It's editing 101.<br/><br/>The acting was exactly what you would expect from a robots vs monsters film. Nothing more nothing less; cardboard cutouts, stereotypical, without any arcs. There is only one female role (except few others extras) in the whole film which is totally out of balance with the social dynamic created within the narrative. <br/><br/>The music is good and it works. It is funny that ""works"" today turned into a compliment though. It does a good job of embracing brutal fighting sequences and it also works on squeezing out that much needed gram of emotion. It feels really nice to hear thematic and fleshed out melodic material making a comeback in a world where soundtracks have become mostly sound design.<br/><br/>CGI is well... CGI. The monsters sometimes look silly, not menacing enough and the giant robots seem very fragile and clunky. I know this is a form of a tribute to the golden age of cinematography where giant monsters were some guys dressed up in rubber suits walking around a set made out of cardboard, but a tribute should be a short and clear statement, not an entire two hours film. In my opinion, CGI should complement and augment good acting, good story telling, good character development, not to be the sole reason for the existence of a film. Yes, this is a robots vs monsters movie, but that doesn't justify disregarding the very foundation that makes up a cinematic experience. Popcorn and all, i saw at least three opportunities for the story to take an alternate route to a more complex and fulfilling end scenario.<br/><br/>Like any other of my fellow sci-fi enthusiast, I can suspend my disbelief. I can even stretch it pretty far. But I cannot in good faith support the stupidity needed for a story to exist. Darwin winning prize minds thought it was better to build giant robots that work via an incredibly complicated and unexplainable mind meld of two people instead of arming strategic nuclear devices on the bottom of the Pacific and detonating them whenever one of the monsters emerge. I have games where I can operate giant robots using my keyboard and mouse only. There are surgeons who in extremely difficult operations are using robots that are capable of performing incredible and accurate tasks. There are guns today that can inflict unimaginable chaos and destruction on almost any kind of earthly scale. Yet in this film, we need giant clunky robots that perform ninja-like actions to wrestle and beat the monsters to a pulp, piloted by some people that are somehow compatible to mind meld in a black magic driven process. And let's put them right in the middle of the action, because you know, remote control is too futuristic. We see steel penetrating the monster's skin while F22 rockets are barely effective against it, because again, there's nothing better than a knife at a gunfight. This is Occam's razor violation at its finest. You want to justify giant robots fighting giant beasts? Then please make it so in a way not to sound so abysmal when the whole script is laid out on the table. <br/><br/>Comic relief is a poor attempt to say the least. The only two ""bright minds"" available in the whole world act like Laurel and Hardy all throughout the film, reaching idiotic and blatantly obvious conclusions. They are nothing more than embarrassments for the scientific community and they are the perfect portrayal for how this movie treats its science. <br/><br/>The film has its few moments to shine, but that's about it. They do not add up to something more. The story is too simple and it's told in an amateur way. Acting is bad not because actors fail to deliver a good performance, but because there is no performance for them to give. Directing is not good; fighting scenes are too pampered becoming over-saturated, and in other scenes it is almost absent. Music is the only redeemable quality of this title that I quite enjoyed. This is a high-budget triple A popcorn flick, but for me personally this film was a let-down. After all that hype and attention it received in media, I hoped at least that at the end of it I will get that smile, that u-mph that says ""Ok, this was a decent summer flick"", but alas, it did not happen. <br/><br/>Even if you have low expectations like I had, you still might not enjoy this title, therefore I would recommend you not to go and see it, because you would only feed the hungry money making Hollywood machine and right now they need to realize that spewing out half baked films like this will not help them for the future. But that again what do I know? I'm just another random ticket-payer movie-goer, who wrote another review in a sea of endless reviews that are disregarded completely by the film industry."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","9","12","22","18 July 2013"," Good old-fashioned, explosive fun
","I was giving up on the idea of ever looking forward to another big Hollywood summer movie ever again, but then Pacific Rim comes along with its charmingly simple plot, incredible special effects, an almost perfect tone, 3D that didn't destroy my eyes or make everything look dark and blurry, and, most importantly of all, a sense of fun. I felt happy and alive coming out of the theatre, and for once I felt as though not a cent had been wasted on my ridiculously expensive movie ticket. This is one you should all go and check out. Need more reasons to do so? Okay, here we go...<br/><br/><ul><li>Guillermo Del Toro. This guy knows how to make a movie. Pan's Labyrinth is an absolutely amazing film, and one of my all time favourites. Hellboy 1 was decent in my opinion, but the sequel I thought was really good. Pacific Rim I like a little more than the Hellboy films, but it's definitely not quite up there with Pan's Labyrinth. It lacks the emotion and the artistry of that film, but it's still a great movie, just in a different way. This movie is visually astonishing in almost every regard, and I think Del Toro himself can largely be thanked for that. The action scenes feature CGI so good you won't even feel like complaining about it, and are constructed in a coherent, satisfying manner. There's no irritating shaky-cam here, and thankfully the movie doesn't skimp on the violence either- no humans die graphic deaths of course, but a number of giant monsters get absolutely pummelled and ripped to shreds by the robots, and it's satisfying as hell to see this happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Keeps the plot simple. There's no overly convoluted villain motivations, no absurd and annoying twists in the story, and no characters that are too complicated for their own good. This movie features giant monsters that want to take over Earth, and this causes the humans to build giant, controllable robots to fight the monsters. That's your plot. There are characters, and while they're almost all archetypal, the movie's aware of this, and somehow this makes it okay. We get enough character development to at least care for these people. This movie uses very traditional, standard characters in a way that's somehow not bothersome. The actors are all serviceable too, with Idris Elba probably coming the closest to standing out. So the dialogue, characters, and acting are all, for the most part, merely serviceable, but they really don't need to be anything more in this movie. The characters remain consistent, and aren't irritating (not even the comic relief scientist characters), and for me that was all they needed to be in a film like this.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crazy scale: The monsters and robots in this movie are absolutely gigantic, and this makes the fight scenes awe-inspiring. These are creatures that are literally the size of sky-scrapers, and there's something crazily entertaining about seeing such huge things do battle together. There's a real weight to the fight scenes as well- the booming sound and convincing CGI really makes you feel every single punch. It's all very forceful, intense, visceral, and convincing. And yeah, as mentioned before, the sheer scale of the movie never stops being impressive. You know these things are big when one robot wields a cargo ship and uses it as a melee weapon.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie is actually fun: Not all movies have to be fun and entertaining. Hell, a lot of my favourite movies aren't particularly fun to watch (Requiem for a Dream anyone?), yet they might be really engaging at both an emotional and intellectual level, or they may provoke strong physical reactions do to the way they're constructed.. Big Hollywood blockbusters, however, should be fun. They shouldn't all try to be so ""deep"" and ""thought-provoking."" Big action scenes and personal character drama just don't really mix too well- maybe Christopher Nolan can pull it off, but he's the exception in this case. Leave the deep stuff to the independent and foreign film-makers. Big movies like Pacific Rim should just be a blast to watch, and, thankfully, Pacific Rim is an absolute blast to watch. It never stops being entertaining- I was giggling in glee throughout almost the entire film, and I left the theatre feeling almost euphoric. Yeah, I had a great time. And even better, the movie feels like it was made by people who were having fun as well. It's nice to watch a movie and get the sense that the people who worked on it enjoyed doing so. Maybe in reality they didn't, but it certainly doesn't feel like that based solely on just watching the movie they ended up making.</li></ul><br/><br/>So should you see this one? Yes. Definitely yes. Especially if you've come out of more than one big blockbuster film this year feeling like you haven't really enjoyed yourself. Pacific Rim is explosive, silly, and completely over-the-top, but the film-makers were aware of this, and as a result just had fun with the whole thing; you find yourself laughing with the film rather than at the film. It's a gleeful, somewhat tongue-in-cheek film that just wants to entertain its audience.<br/><br/>According to the ever reliable Wikipedia, Del Toro envisioned Pacific Rim as an earnest, colourful adventure story, with an ""incredibly airy and light feel"", in contrast to the ""super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie"". If this was indeed the case, he couldn't have succeeded more."

","After seeing Pacific Rim yesterday on a whim because I thought The Lone Ranger was going to be Pirates of the Caribbean in the outback, I was sorely disappointing and felt quite ripped off for the experience. <br/><br/>Knowing nothing of the back story, I have never been into a movie before where I checked my watch so many times to see when the pain would be over.<br/><br/>It is really hard to believe this movie is rating so highly on IMDb, it is possibly because of the fan-boys of the movie getting in and voting; inflating the average, but I would say based on mainstream audiences, it would come in at about 2-5 / 10.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, the movies run-time was too long, the scientist was very annoying, the black guy was always yelling when he spoke, the Asian did nothing to contribute, and the Aussie accents we're not real. <br/><br/>There was no humor in this movie, lots and lots of padding with dogs, pathetic small talk love story, ego filled scenes, etc etc.. There was no rapport with the characters, and I just did not care if they died or not, it was a stale experience.<br/><br/>I'm just glad the pain is over and I can purge this very bad movie from memory, one of the worst movies of all time."

","Guillermo del Toro brings his unique creative sensibilities to a genre that's been pushed into the ground, and while the results are entertaining and cool to watch it still has this ""been-there-done-that"" feel. For one, this level of destruction has been done before in all of the Transformers movies, and while it's more competently filmed here you can't escape the feeling that you've seen most of this stuff before. A few quibbles about this: no attention is paid whatsoever to collateral damage, but then again, that's a problem with the violence in most PG-13 movies. Also, the decision to film most of the action at night and around the ocean results in it being a little hard to follow due to the poor lighting and the fact that the robots and kaiju take up most of the screen because of their immense size. Moving on, I thought that the comedic relief in the form of two bickering scientists was well written and played, although it didn't really serve the story too much until the end. In fact, the story as a whole wasn't really spectacular, and was filled with a lot of cliché moments and was very predictable. Despite all of these things, it was fun to watch and I had a good time. An entertaining, but ultimately forgettable, popcorn flick."

Other than fight scenes in CGI - which I didn't find that interesting, there's not much to the film. There was not even an interesting backstory on the Kaiju. Their dinosaur form and adaptation to battles was kind of interesting but wasn't explored.

"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","4","2","2","19 September 2014"," Hilariously terrible
","I enjoyed Pacific Rim. It was all very good fun to watch with friends. But that doesn't make it a good film, does it? Let's start with an example from the start of the movie: These humongous monsters start destroying the world, then, in a matter of a few months, humans develop enormous super robots to fight back. These are initially successful, but eventually the monsters become stronger and regain the upper hand. So, time for a change of strategy! Instead of fighting back with our Voltron-like super robots that probably cost all the world's resources, we are moving to plan B: build a ridiculously tall coastal wall, which apparently is meant to cover the entirety of land adjacent to the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>This is the amount of thought that went into Pacific Rim. A film where every turn of the plot (well, the ""plot"") can be foreseen, where the non-Americans are (very) expendable, and the Kaijus stay behind to guard a gate that cannot be breached unless they themselves pass through it - so let's just stay here in case the humans figure it out and want to come along. A film of course where the heroes are extremely happy to protect humanity by demolishing entire cities and probably killing millions in the process - but hey, if a robot and a monster fighting ten meters away from a fishing boat doesn't cause it any damage, maybe all is well.<br/><br/>Certainly, the more ridiculous it gets, the more fun it is. There is a certain pleasure in seeing a creature weighing 2000 tonnes (?) grabbing an equally large robot and then spreading its leather wings and taking flight. TO SPACE. Wherefrom the robot falls. In a stadium. And isn't damaged. At all. The clichés parade one after another, turning Pentecost into a sort of a cult character and the entire movie into an amusing ride, which couldn't however really be considered cinema. And for which I refuse to believe Del Toro couldn't have tried a little bit harder. On the plus side, the fight scenes are good (not chaotic with a camera spinning crazily for no reason or something)"

However, the end result felt to me like a cold paint-by-numbers exercise with a vast visual effects budget.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I don't think that del Toro ever fell into the trap of taking any of it seriously: there's a sense of sly fun that permeates the movie all the way through to a short scene embedded in the closing credits. However, this wasn't enough to save the movie for me, where a 25-minute, Saturday-morning-cartoon plot is expected to support a 130-minute feature film. To be honest, despite all the undeniably impressive visuals, I was horribly bored by the end.<br/><br/>To some degree, I think the ultra-realistic visuals worked against the movie. The basic premise of choosing to combat giant sea monsters by building giant robots to engage them hand-to-hand is of course ridiculous. That's not something that should matter in this particular genre: plausibility is very definitely not part of the fun. However, for me at least, the realism of the presentation seemed to demand a more realistic premise. It just seemed very weird to have such nonsense presented so highly naturalistically.<br/><br/>I mostly enjoyed ""Pacific Rim"" but was very glad when it was over.

","So the story is aliens have invaded earth, in monster form, and humans have built gigantic robots for defending themselves and fighting the aliens (kaiju). Once again, del Toro doesn't disappoint in visual effects at all, I think his sound department also has done a great job. The action scenes, they look awesome, you get engaged in them quickly and get excited for them, it's actually how the movie starts and then the title comes after 17 minutes (which I really liked that, because it set up the tone of the movie before anything officially gets started). However, series of denial decisions happen by different characters that none of them makes sense at all; in fact it creates some frustration. Besides that, the two scientists are just too cartoonish, which I guess they're meant to be there to create some humor, but in my opinion it makes the movie cheesy. About being cheesy, the ending should have been better (maybe I should blame it on the studio?), however what I like about the story is, it's not a commercial movie for national guard, army, navy, air force or anything like that, it's not USA saving the world, and I really dig that. The performances are decent, Idris Elba absolutely owned this movie, he definitely doesn't seem to be a supporting role, Charlie Hunnam whom I had seen for the first in Green Street Hooligans is great as well, but Charlie Day to is a little annoying here, I can't really blame it on his performance, again his role is just too cartoonish. Also regarding the soundtrack, it's decent and good enough for the movie, however my expectations from Ramin Djawadi has been raised since Game of Throne's latest season soundtrack was just amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're going to this movie for the battle scenes, you'll enjoy the feck out of it, in that case the movie would get slow at some points, and if you expect some amazing story here, you'd be disappointed. Even that, the movie is still entertaining; I give it 7.5/10."

Not to say that Transformers is bad, but the story and the directing isn't nowhere near as good as it is in Pacific Rim.

To the films story line, I could feel a solid note that everyone wanted the film to do well but that they did not believe in its core value. (future Tech against Aliens) <br/><br/>I only downgraded the film from a 10 because of this. I think that the acting was on point and the use of lighting and scale played out so well that I am left wanting more of the experience. <br/><br/>What I am left feeling is; Wow, that was better than I expected.

","I'm writing this because I lost a bet with a friend of mine. I said that if I like this film I'd write my first ever IMDb review. What can I say? I lost.<br/><br/>Going in skeptical that this was going to be a CGI monstrosity with little plot, lots of explosions, and bad acting, I was beyond surprised when I found myself lost in the film. Charlie Hunnam's performance wasn't top notch acting but he pulled off his character well without overacting. The responses by other characters in the film seemed genuine and almost realistic. Idris Elba was perfectly chosen for his role. The Jaeger battles were shot, from what I perceived, as if someone were nearby watching the battle unfold. Another point I liked was the love story between Hunnam's character and Rinko Kikuchi's character, Mako. Well, I should say ""implied love story"". Only in one line of dialogue was it even referenced. Their relationship was merely implied to the audience and then left to simmer as to not take away from the rest of the story.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast did well, but I thought their roles were rather short. The Russian and Chinese pilots had very little screen time but once again it seemed the film was made to be more realistic with more real-world emotional responses. In that respect it was well done.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. 3D is the only way to see this film. I'm not a big fan of 3D but this is one film that really uses it well."
"jr73340","8","6","10","23 July 2013"," My compliments to the director and the script writers
","Pacific Rim was very entertaining and it actually kept my attention for the whole two hours - something very few modern movies have been able to do. By the end of the movie, I ACTUALLY cared about what happens to the characters and how the story was going to resolve itself (despite the fairly standard-predictable-ending).<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for Pacific Rim, I was sure it was going to be another brainless-CGI-bonanza that has NO character development, NO coherent plot, NO good actors and NO chemistry between those actors. You know what I'm talking about. I was expecting another ""Transformers 2"", ""Battleship"" or ""Total Recall"". I was wrong.<br/><br/>I am by no means saying that Pacific Rim is Oscar material; but at least the director - together with the script writers and the actors - were able to produce some witty and compelling scenes that got me emotionally involved with the characters. That's very rare today.<br/><br/>But there is something else that I want to compliment the director on:<br/><br/>1) This movie had no political agenda that I could detect. There were no unnecessary snipes at Christianity, there was no promotion of ""alternative lifestyles"", and there was no criticism of capitalism or the military (aka the typical Hollywood targets). Well done.<br/><br/>2) There was no nudity and no gratuitous sex scenes, even though there was a strong romantic relationship between the two main characters. In other words, there was no sexual propaganda in this movie. Well Done.<br/><br/>3)There was very little use (if any) of the F-word in this movie. The characters were able to express their ""toughness"" and determination without resorting to childish profanity. Well Done.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The plot of this movie is not as simple as just Godzilla vs Transformers/Power Rangers, however, it is also not as complex as Oblivion. Ron Perlman and Idris Elba were the ones who stole the show. Ron Perlman, despite appearing only after half the movie, was still able to do a good job. Idris Elba had the best development I should say.<br/><br/>This story focuses more on plot development than character development, with the least character development given to its main character. The Kaijus have unique looks. None of them will remind you of Godzilla, however, there are some that will remind you of animals e.g. Shark, Frog, Bat Kaijus. The Jaegers, despite only a few being shown, were also cool. The CGI is pretty realistic and doesn't look like a Saturday Morning Cartoon at all.<br/><br/>There are a few memorable quotes, those that we have already seen in the trailer. The plot is rather understandable and the action scenes are slow and steady, allowing you to see what is happening throughout, except for a few parts where they zoom in too much.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie where you won't be emotionally-affected, and want to look for an action-packed movie with spectacular special effects and an interesting plot, look no further.

","WARNING spoilers!<br/><br/>Wtf? Really? But seriously though, how was this movie made? I mean was it based on some well liked series of books, comic books, TV series, anything? From the looks of it no.<br/><br/>They just made it up, and boy does it show. The plot makes 0 sense. The acting is TERRIBLE and the ending is confusing.<br/><br/>Really the whole story make no sense. Why these monsters are here, why they are called certain things, why the suits are different, etc. The only stable thing was this supposed relationship between The main male character and the main female character.<br/><br/>But that went no where. As with all other things in this movie it fizzled out. When she first saw him, she was all blushing and such. And he would give a grin or two. But the last scene they did not even kiss as you would expect. Yes, it would have been cliché. And they did show some control for not going for that 'We're alive let's kiss' thing. But in a movie that follows every OTHER cliché (there is only 1 man 4 the job, opposites attract, we gotta work 2gether, etc.) why not do the one that ppl actually ENJOY!?<br/><br/>I suppose that would mess with the girls story and sort of reduce her to a physical object. But it does that ANYWAYS with the whole 'don't let her fight cuz she's a girl' thing! I was really let down there was not even a kiss. I mean don't build up a romance and then lead it to friendship. Really they hugged at the end? Why was she all checking his ripped body out earlier in the movie? What were those googly eyes she had for him when she first met him? Why did he keep sticking up for here even though he KNEW she was not ready? They liked each other. The no kiss ending was sad. Either she is the sad puppy dog. Or he just does not see her in that way. Or perhaps they left this to be explored in the *shudders* sequel.<br/><br/>Which leads me to my main point how in the hell was this big-budget Hollywood movie even made? How? WHO approved it? WHO? Some guy had a random idea and they just said yes? WHAT? So many great movie ideas out there and they chose THIS!? Sad that a movie devoid of all good qualities gets made. Bad acting? Check. Non-sense making plot? Check. Nothing gets paid off? Check. I mean really I would go into detail about how many things make no sense in this move but many b4 me have already done that. Basically this movie is a half-@$$ed effort of mashing several movies into 1. Action/CGI/Comedy/Romance/Mystery/SciFic/Drama. But just like in cooking when you throw too many ingredients into a dish it is no longer delicious but confusing as all the elements struggle for your attention. It tries to be everything and ends up as nothing due to general laziness on Hollywood's part for not demanding better quality movies. I only watched this in desperation to see a new movie. I guess when it's the only game in town ppl see it. How sad."

","i apologize for some ""less than perfect"" word choices here but IMDb won't let me use certain applicable words to this genre!<br/><br/>based on the attitudes i saw expressed by viewers and fans, i decided to attempt to lower my standards like most of you attested to doing beforehand. i've heard of this technique before and always thought it was akin to letting a bully spit on you every day instead of just taking a swing. <br/><br/>i was able to overlook the acting, and the story, and the writing, and the casting, and everything else that makes a movie. because, hey, this is at best a pointless action movie full of eye candy and ""super tough"" ""giant robots"" doing the coolest stuff since robot ""jocks,"" right? <br/><br/>but, to my dismay, i still failed. apparently, impressive cg of crazy stuff happening has absolutely no effect on me anymore. it's been happening a bunch and now i'm sure of it. it happened in iron man 3, into darkness, avengers, dark knight rises, hobbit - the list goes on in varying degrees back to the birth of cg. effects can not replace human content. that's it. i hate to say it, but the only time this rule isn't true, is when buffoons are watching the movie, and that makes up most of the USA so, as my title says, i guess i'm a snob. <br/><br/>the appearance of my plight is akin to sexual impotence, insofar as my chemicals won't get pumping with presented with something physical meant for enjoyment. but it's not something i would want to treat like normal impotence, because this situation is tantamount to being expected to get it up and make love to a dead body or an unconscious woman. my brain overrides my body and thats it. <br/><br/>so strip away the cg glory and they eye candy and what do you have left? well you got kick butt ""giant robot"" fighting going on, right? again, i wanted to enjoy this, as i too am an old ""battle tech and ""row bow"" tech and everything in between"" fan from around the way. i'm 31 and a lot of my existence is predicated on the jacking off to ""giant robots."" i'm a prime candidate for this movie. <br/><br/>well the movie did not deliver on these lines either. the fighting basically stunk. i think with all their little tributes to japan, this movie could have wised-up and made their ""giant robots"" agile, y'know, while they were in there being completely unrealistic anyway. these things moved like glittery walking trash cans with Parkinson's. it's just not fun to look at or believable in the face of these beasts, who also moved way slower than their bodies implied. they had animal muscular structures and should have been a lot more fast and deadly. <br/><br/>to make a good pure action movie, you actually need to still be quite an effective story teller. the story is told through the bodies being photographed. its a dance. this movie brought none of that idea to the table. there was an insufferable level of information-poor action going on. i spent much of the time utterly confused about what exactly was taking place on screen. i always thought this kind of presentation lent itself to movies trying to cover up poor choreography but that excuse doesn't hold when its all cg and you can do anything you want. when i could decipher the action, it always amounted to a clunky punch or ineffective ram and tumble of some kind. a sword was randomly brought out toward the end, and promised an improvement on the action if only by virtue of ""how can a sword not help this mess"" but it was sadly forsaken by the writers before and after that brief moment.<br/><br/>the only other possible leg this movie had to stand on pure, unbridled, and blinding nostalgia. the very nature of allowing nostalgia to become criteria for enjoyment of a medium allows one to paint a quite distorted picture indeed. personally, i have an aversion to this practice because i have been disgusted with how it makes people act. if you got something out of this film using nostalgia, then i commend you, because i thought this movie failed at conjuring the best of anything i had ever loved in the past."

"p-stepien","8","5","8","11 October 2013"," Bombastic spectacular spectacle
","""Pacific Rim"" is hardly innovative. Actually quite the opposite it is an epic exercise in post-modernist Tarantinesque mash-ups, where Mexican director Guillermo del Toro takes Japanese kaiju inspirations and their love for big mechabots, molds it with some quasi-Lovecraft mythology to create a bombastic blockbuster feature with little other intent that to entertain. And del Toro clearly has absolutely no other higher pretence. Popcorn at its finest (at the same time setting a high bar for Gareth Edwards ""Godzilla"").<br/><br/>When a mysterious rupture appears somewhere on the Pacific rim, giant monsters start emerging from the ocean, creating havoc and destruction on coastline areas. Confronted with this deadly gargantuan opponent a new method of defence must be formed, thus initiating the Jaeger programme of giant human-controlled robots. Due to the mental burden of controlling a monstrous Jaeger two pilots are necessary, both having to share their minds through a neural bridge. After a temporary turning of the tide in favour of humanity, the kaiju threat increases and soon all but four towering Jaegers are left to defend our planet. Amongst the remaining pilot is previously retired ace Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and an untrained cadet Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Led by the legendary pilot Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) they are all that stands between the inevitable apocalypse.<br/><br/>Focusing on the spectacle, del Toro does his best to distract attention from human casualties, so instead of single humans being treaded upon we see a visual treat of epic proportions. Forced on by cardboard cutouts the story can never be held as anything other than generic fodder, even if the masterful presence of Idris Elba spurting out gibberish, as if he was delivering Shakespearesque brilliance, does its best to hide the thinly plotted story. That said del Toro has enough sensibility and rationality to deliver a story without gaping plot holes and illogical contrivances, thus making it a thankful respite from cascades of movies spurting out nonsense with almost religious zeal.<br/><br/>Within this behemoth of a movie lurk the age-old trusted interior mechanisms of blockbuster action movies, introduced however with a certain finesse of which directors like Michael Bay are incapable of. Pure enjoyment is what is on offer - expect anything else and you will be sorely disappointed. Lay back mind-meld to the blockbuster of the season."

","This movie was great! Just about every thing was perfect. <br/><br/>My only real complaint is the leading actor. Charlie Hunnam is big on action and short on some of his acting. He does have that slow speech non-American actors have when attempting to mask their accent. It really damages the chemistry between the two leads because he is focusing so hard on sounding a certain way. It just wasn't natural for him. I'm not going to go so far as to say he can't act, but I think his performance could have been better and more natural if he could have just spoke how is he accustomed to.<br/><br/>Masking an accent really hinders the actors abilities to connect with their character. <br/><br/>If you can power past the lead actors annoying drawl you will no doubt enjoy this movie if you like action, robots, big explosions, Asian culture, well-done monsters and a surprisingly good story."

","This movie is a blend between: Alien, Matrix and Transformers and if you like all of the above you don't have to read my review and just go and watch it, you'll like it. The main story is pretty simple, when aliens start invading earth, all differences are put aside and the whole world joins to build robots to fight these giant aliens. Adding a sad story about the main character Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and you have a basic storyline grid used in a lot of movies. But the movie can make it up with an impressive and innovative alien live form. One of the best alien life form since Alien (1979) and Predator in 1987. But what makes this movie really enjoyable are the special effects (2D Version). The animations are perfectly detailed and not too dominant.

","From what i saw on this movie's page here people either love this movie or hate it to the point where they would write a review about it.<br/><br/>Firstly i have to say i'm not an expert or a person aspiring to be a critic, but this movie was ""okay"". As expected of a 2013 movie with giant robots - the visuals are absolutely stunning. Apart from that everything just seems lacking - dialogues seemed unnatural, everything behind the technology (how stuff works) was just mentioned as opposed to being explained. I mean: ""The deeper the bond, the stronger you fight."" may as well have been followed by ""You're just going to have to accept this and move on."" .As for the acting, i don't feel equipped to talk adequately about this so i'm going to move on to the reason i decided to write this review.<br/><br/>So the main reason i wrote this is because i noticed a great similarity between this movie and a relatively old Japanese anime. The anime is called Neon Genesis Evangelion. The weird thing is that only in the first 20 minutes of the movie there are already a number of relatively significant similarities. Okay, so the plot. Beings of another world/dimension attacking earth and people build giant robots to fight them. It's a solid example but i'm sure there are tons of other titles who fit this description. But here is where it gets weird - a head of an organization who is pressured by military/politicians when the only thing he cares about is producing results and still remains indifferent to the warnings/threats of the people pressuring him. I'd say it's 1:1, but there was not enough emphasis on this not-so-minor details (namely personalities).<br/><br/>Another similarity, and i will try to make this one shorter, is the technological bit. Pilots synchronizing with the robot to ""fight stronger"" is exactly what happens in NGE, but everything there is explained and seems more logical, while in Pacific Rim it just seems glued on to make the main characters special in some way.<br/><br/>Of course there are other things. But i'm going to stop here, because i have to be honest with myself. When i wasn't busy looking for potential rip off material i was genuinely enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for something to watch i'd recommend this. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not really as bad as some people say it is."

"Collie_M","7","5","8","15 August 2013"," Action-packed film in the mould of Godzilla and Transformers
","This film is a great one to watch of you want to sit back and enjoy great special effects, fantasy fight scenes and not-to-taxing but relatively enjoyable storyline. Essentially, it is good escapism and if you suspend your disbelief, its an enjoyable trip to the cinema, especially in Imax/3D.<br/><br/>The plot is like a cross between Godzilla and Transformers, with huge aliens/monsters emerging from the sea with increasing regularity to be combated by huge man-made and piloted robots in the general shape of humans, with an array of weapons and attributes. Unlike Godzilla though, no sympathy is expressed towards the Kayju (monsters) as they are portrayed as purely evil: although it is not the intention of the film to make the reader feel much other than awe and excitement at the action scenes. <br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly good. Many cliché characters are there: The battle hardened captain, the female love interest, the hero returning with scarred memories, the 'rival' good-guy, and the computer/nerdy types trying to think a way to victory. The use of stereotypes allows the viewer not to worry too much about character formation as much of the character formation is already done through preconceived ideas, and this allows the film to concentrate on what it does best: Provide action. The characters aren't too shallow or empty though either for the most part: there is some complexity to their relationships at times and this is due to the decent acting quality. Granted there won't be any Oscar-nominations for the performances, but there won't be any Razzie nominated ones either. <br/><br/>The film, like many of its kind, is predictable but the journey along the way is filled with enough action to make it enjoyable. Many parts are fantasy but the film knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything it is not. It plays to it and achieves its goals. It's not one that will stay with the audience for long after they leave the cinema doors, but it is a solid, action- packed, fantasy/end-of-the-world flick which does exactly what it says on the tin."
"reissalvin1998","7","5","8","30 July 2013"," Quick review
","Pacific Rim is a sci-fi, action packed summer blockbuster of 2013. The movies takes place when Earth is being invaded by gigantic aliens that none any already-existed weapons can sufficiently take down, the human creates the Jaegers which are gigantic piloted robots to counter and end the invasion.   To me, this is what summer movies should be. The movie has stunning visual effects. The robots are beautifully crafted and rendered. Action scenes are breath-taking. If you want an all-out, ass-kicking, robot-smashing, explosive goodness, this is the movie.   However, don't expect complex plots, well-developed characters WITH phenomenal action. Characters are predictable and simple. There are no sub-plots in the movie, just saving the Earth and kicking asses.   In my opinion, this is a great movie to watch but it could be better developed, both the fighting and the human characters. Recommended."
"MrGadgetman","7","5","8","28 July 2013"," Great Action, Great FX!
","Objectively speaking, this really was a good movie to watch. It came out of the gate with action and it immediately began laying the ground work for the story, which was pretty good and easy to follow. I like billed action movies that actually get right into the action without boring you with a bunch of dry back-story. Even this movie's back-story had a lot of action. Furthermore, the pace of the movie was good with only a minor lull here and there. Also, this movie did not make the mistake of doing what a lot of big budget films do which is to beat you over the head with bang, bang and then boom action.<br/><br/>Visually, the special effects were great and the action scenes were filmed in a way that was easy to follow and enjoy. No crazy extreme angles, or dizzying close-ups (Bourne ID Series). Most of the shots were filmed wide enough for you to enjoy the sweet visuals and none of that shaky hand-held camera (again, Bourne ID Series) crap that makes you dizzy and detracts from the frenetic action sequences. It seems the new thing is to have this ""realistic"" in-the-middle-of-the-action camera angle that's hand-held and is shaky as if some field reporter was catching the shot, but all it does is become a distraction and you find yourself reaching for a remote to rewind it so you can make sense of it. Not this movie. The scenes were scoped just right, well, most of them and the action drew you in at every engagement.<br/><br/>Personally, I found myself poking holes in the story and while I enjoyed the movie and it's awesome-ness..., I still sat there going, ""Hmmm, I see..., and why?"" For example; {ALERT: Spoiler} Twin operators: Why do you need two pilots again? Mind-melded through a neural interface with the robot? I mean, it was explained, but it still didn't make sense to me. Two pilots operate independent sides of the unit just as both hemispheres operate our bodies? Sooo, why did one of the robots have three pilots? And if you are jacked into the hardware through your brain...why do you still need tactile control surfaces and switch gear on multiple panels in the cockpit? Maybe in case the interface fails? Well, does that mean that you can operate these things without the mental connection? How do they keep from arguing? What if they disagree on a tactic? What if one wants to zig while the other wants to zag..., does the robot trip n' fall in confusion? The neural interface thing seemed to work well in say, Avatar..., here, not so much for me.<br/><br/>Larger-than-life robots seemed to be operated fine in every other version within the genre by one pilot, a CPU and good ole controls so why this radical departure. I'm not a man against change, just change that isn't plausible or doesn't make sense. Another thing that got me was Humanity's response to the invasion. Mankind was able to develop amazing technology in the advancement of biomechanical interfacing and also able to pool enormous amounts of resources and materials to construct the robots but scientists weren't able to figure out how to blow those monsters up from far away? I understand that nuking 'em would be mutually destructive but there are a lot of options between nuclear bombs and tank shells. After all, the monsters were easy targets because you always knew where they were going to appear; the pacific ocean. Lastly, a core meltdown? While sounding dramatic, a core meltdown does not actually result in a nuclear explosion.<br/><br/>Other than some other physics and plot holes I did enjoy the movie and I certainly would recommend going to see it on the big screen. It was fun to watch."

I feel like this movie was better at making sure the story was relative to the action that was taking place. I also think that when there was action, it was shot better. And what I mean by that is the camera doesn't seem to shake and you don't only get quick bits and pieces of the fight.<br/><br/>What I would compare it too, would be the T.V. show, ""Power Rangers"". All of those episodes would usually end with a battle between an enlarged creature against the Power Rangers who combined their droids, zords, I can't remember. Anyway, think of that but with the action 100 times better! If you enjoy action, some funny one liners, and a decent story that brings it all together, definitely give this a shot!"

","I watched this movie with some friends despite telling myself a thousand times it was going to be terrible. The trailers never once hinted at anything that resembled a plot. But it was a cheap day, and I had nothing better to do. I'll start with the cast. It contains basically no ""big-names"", which isn't always a bad thing. Problem is, it also doesn't contain any good acting. At all. There was not a single watchable performance in the movie. I do feel a little bad for the actors, though, as the writing was so terrible Daniel-Day Lewis would have struggled to say any of it convincingly. Two actors in particular, Burn Gorman and Charlie Day who play the two scientist, give maybe the worst performances I've ever seen. They are not even good enough to put into a kid's film. I don't know if that's what the director wanted, if it is, that's one more knock against him.<br/><br/>Now the effects. I didn't really like Avatar, but I could at least appreciate the immense accomplishment of the visual effects. It was an unoriginal story, but it at least tried to develop it's characters. This film tried, barely, and failed terribly. It was impossible to care about anyone on screen. Back to the effects though. With nearly $200 million going straight to the CGI, they had to look good. It was nearly all you look at for 2 hours, after all. And that's all they look, good. Not ""blow me away"", or ""coolest thing I've ever seen in a movie"". Just good enough. Think Transformers meets Avatar. I heard Guillermo del Toro describe the movie as a ""visual feast"". It was closer to an assault on the eyes and ears for 2 hours. I looked away often because I knew I wasn't going to miss anything, and I didn't want to see it because I knew what would happen. <br/><br/>The plot. Unoriginal is an understatement. It's disappointingly simple and uncreative. The dialogue is laughable. That's not just a saying. Me and my friends laughed in the theatre at multiple lines. Again, bad writing and bad acting.<br/><br/>This was not an enjoyable movie to see, unless you truly don't care at all about intelligence in a film. You may say I just don't know how to ""have fun"" while watching a movie. That's like a little kid showing me Power Rangers episode and then wondering why I didn't love it. Do yourself a favour and skip this movie."

","There are only two angles to review this film from.First is as a preschooler, possibly able to eat solids and potty trained (this is the demographic i hope the film was aimed at).From this diminutive position the whole feature will be lots of flashing lights and creatures and robots and planes and stuff...wow. To anyone else, anyone with half a brain, anyone who can use the big toilet will see this for the steaming pile of vacuity it really is.It felt like brain rape sitting through it. The only way i could endure such utter garbage was to hold a cabbage to the side of my head and try to master 'drifting' with it.The cabbage, with its iQ of zero, couldn't take more than 10 minutes before it got up, declared it to be an abomination and left. As a 2+ hour advert for the forthcoming Jaeger toy range it was a complete success but peel away the gossamer veneer of a story and you'll find nothing of any real substance, nothing at all. I find it staggering that it has a IMDb rating of over 7. It is a damning indictment of how low our expectation levels have fallen. Move on, nothing to see here."

","I know enough about filmmaking to where I can look at a movie and have some idea of how much work had to go into making it. And right from the start, Pacific Rim is STAGGERINGLY well-produced, so much so that it blew my mind. Giant monsters tear up the Golden Gate Bridge in slow motion. Giant robots wrestle with them underwater. Funky Chinese neighborhoods rebuild around the rib bones of vanquished monsters. We see the sumptuously detailed, futuristic airplane hangars where the giant robots are built.<br/><br/>And it starts off pretty good, too -- giant marauding monsters from a tear between dimensions at the bottom of the ocean? And the only way they can be fought is with giant robots? I actually bought that, the way they explained this at the beginning made it seem plausible -- sort of a surreal parable about man challenging the gods with his cunning. With the promise of there being even more dangerous monsters to come, I was excited about seeing the rest of it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it slowly got more boring after the exposition. It wasn't the lame acting, which was good enough for a movie about giant robots. This isn't Officer and a Gentleman.<br/><br/>No, the biggest problem was just that the monsters and the robots just looked BORING... And all VERY SIMILAR. I mean come on, you have all this money and all these top artists and animators at your disposal, yet the monsters are all these desperately middle-of-the-road ""Godzilla 1998"" knock-offs with absolutely no personality. The monsters from ""Inhumanoids"" were more creative and scary than these brain-dead lumps that just lumber through towns and throw slow-motion haymakers while roaring like walruses."

If you've seen the trailers and clips you'll know what you're getting Summer blockbuster spectacle and possibly like me you gave it a very wide berth . Wait a minute though , perhaps Mexican Guillermo Del Toro is conscious of this and has done something that at first hand seems impossible - he's made a Summer FX driven spectacular blockbuster that is genuinely fun <br/><br/>With the opening three minutes that could have been a movie in its own he tells the audience everything they need to know including a well thought out reason as to why humanity needs to build giant human powered robots but it's with the human elements he hits the bulls eye . Again being non American he's probably well aware that international audiences get a bit fed up watching hunky square jawed brave Americans saving mankind so he's brought a multinational twist to the story . The head of the military is black? Fair enough but why's he talking with a London accent worthy of Dick Van Dyke himself ? Who cares and we have American actors playing British characters complete with weird accents and no one in this film is capable of doing an Australian accent and it sums up the rest of the characters and the film itself where everything is camp , colourful and there's a constant wink to the audience that's constantly saying "" Look this is absolute B movie nonsense but come on you're enjoying every single silly minute of this aren't you ?"" <br/><br/>I know I enjoyed every single silly minute of this B movie nonsense .

","""Everything is equal. We have no borders between robots and people. In the foreign stories, robots are always the enemies. In Japan, they're our friends."" - Osamu Kozaki <br/><br/>Japan's obsession with robots stretches back to the 1950s, when robot mangas like ""Astro Boy"" and ""Tetsujin-28"" became popular. Inspired by the US fire-bombings of Japan, and influenced by everything from Frankenstein, to 17th century karakuri puppets, to Sengoku-era samurai armour, to WW2-era hardware, to the Shinto belief that ""everything has a soul"", these robots would spawn countless animated television series, most notably ""Giant Robo"", ""Voltron"", ""Gundam Suit"", ""Robotech"", ""Evangelion"" and ""Mazinga Z"", the latter of which was very popular in Mexico during the 1980s.<br/><br/>Mexico during the 1980s also happened to be where a young Guillermo del Toro lived. He devoured these robot cartoons, a childhood feast which would inspire his own Giant Robot Feature, ""Pacific Rim"".<br/><br/>Released in 2013, ""Pacific Rim"" stars Charlie Hunnan as Raleigh Becket, a hotshot Jaeger pilot. Giant nuclear powered robots, Jaeger's are humanity's last line of defence against the Kaijus, colossal beasts who attack Earth via portals deep within the Pacific Ocean. As the neural load of Jaeger's is too dangerous for a lone pilot to handle, each Jaeger is piloted by two psychically linked pilots, a concept dubbed ""drifting"".<br/><br/>Tonally, ""Pacific Rim"" is unlike most modern blockbusters. Directed by every boy's inner child, Guillermo's film knows its a ridiculous cartoon but nevertheless adopts a sincere, straight-faced stance. Elsewhere the film's carnage is undercut by ""Rim's"" warmhearted subplots, in which feuding pilots learn to work together, put differences aside and ""drift in the same direction"". That this direction amounts to collaborative warfare is something Guillermo, an outspoken pacifist, can't avoid, but he nevertheless strips his film of all the war-porn tropes which usually bog down similar films.<br/><br/>""Pacific Rim"" was a box-office dud in the United States, a country which likes its anime re-packaged a certain way (""The Matrix"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"", ""Inception"", ""Black Swan"" etc). Guillermo del Toro mostly doesn't abide by these cosmetic conventions, his film light but never flippant, unpretentious, devoid of unnecessary subplots/dialogue masquerading as ""depth"", and free of all the usual totems of Americana. Perhaps because of this, the film was a massive hit in Japan and China.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, ""Rim's"" also a bit unique. Guillermo's Godzilla-battles take place amidst giant waves, his behemoths covered in sea-spray, knee-deep in roiling rain-spattered oceans, their chassis lit by kaleidoscopic purples, blues and pinks. The film's creature designs and fisticuffs are also better than average for this genre, complete with elbow rockets, plasma cannons and gigantic brass knuckles. The film co-stars Idris Elba. Its butt-kicking electro-metal score, by Ramin Djawadi, signals Guillermo's premise with capital letters: HERE THERE BE GIANT ROBOTS PUNCHING GIANT ALIENS IN THE FACE.<br/><br/>8/10 – See ""The Host"" (2006)."

I first saw this movie in my college's auditorium with a group of friends as part of Film Club (they wanted to show something fun during the midterm study break), and to be honest, this movie made me very happy. The action scenes and effects are delightfully colorful and violent, and most of the characters were surprisingly interesting and well-developed for a movie like this. Plus, there is something to be said for a film that portrays the Millennial Generation in a positive light for once.<br/><br/>Even though it was written and directed by the same guy as Pan's Labyrinth, DO NOT expect anything profound to come out of Pacific Rim.

"p-jonsson","7","3","4","22 November 2013"," Great special effects movie with a totally ridiculous story
","I have to say that I enjoyed this pure special effects movie quite a lot even though the plot is totally ridiculous. Clumsy giant robots beating at alien beasts with their fists should be better than modern tanks and airplanes with modern explosive and armor penetrating weapons? As I said, a ridiculous story. Well it does not really matter does it because the story gives an excuse for some real cool special effects loaded action. Giant robots and alien Godzillas in the same movie. Cool, simply cool.<br/><br/>Once you have gotten past the silliness of the story it is a very entertaining roller-coaster ride of action. The scenes where the robots and aliens go head to head is visually very entertaining. Sometimes they make you laugh as well. For instance the scene where Gypsy Danger (the robot) drags a cargo ship after it to use as a club.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a somewhat somber mood is set right from the start by the fact that the Jaeger program is discontinued. Not because they are really defenseless as the movie blurb states but because dumbass politicians wants to save money as usual.<br/><br/>As much as the robot and alien action is tremendously enjoyable I think some of my favorite scenes are the ones with Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau. I have always liked Ron Perlman and he is simply outrageously (as in funny) wacky as Hannibal Chau.<br/><br/>The one thing I did not like with the movie is the ludicrous nonsense statements about the dinosaurs being the first attempt at an invasion. Whoever wrote that must be an idiot. Worse, the fact that it made it into the movie means that someone believes that the audience are idiots. When it then was followed by some green-religious crap that the atmosphere was not right but that we have now ""terraformed"" earth for them by our pollution it was at least a star off just for that. I hate it when they put crap like that in the movies. It is an insult to the audience.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite the dinosaur nonsense I found it a very enjoyable movie. Without that it would have received a near top rating but as I said, it is at least a star off due to that crap."

","I understand why many have shrugged off this movie, but I feel like they're missing the point. This is an action film of ""Robots vs. Godzilla"" that utilizes every cliché just for the fun of being able to. To me, it seems like del Toro wanted to have a bit of fun, but still managed to pull off a little bit of camp without a healthy helping of cheese.<br/><br/>Yes, some of the characters are cliché. There are stoic kung fu triplets, harsh blonde Russians, hopelessly clueless governments, and an over-the-top black market dealer. While some characters are far too heavy handed as to be annoying (looking at you, nerdy neurotic science duo), most are cliché enough to be fun, but the viewer still cares about their deaths and/or is drawn into the tension of their near death experiences. I was surprised that I felt a little bummed when the first character died, about 10 minutes into the film, which I find rare in most modern action films. And in an age when so many action movies care more about how much their monsters can destroy, (looking at you, Man of Steel) rather than a little character development, I can live with a little unoriginality in favor of a good old fashioned, if totally predictable, cinematic arc."

It makes the movie look thoughtless, stupid and worse than transformers (which i hate). It didn't appear to be the type of movie i would enjoy, i would sit there laughing at the cliché acting and unoriginal story. HOWEVER, after borrowing the bluray from a friend, i decided to watch it (mainly to please my girlfriend, who likes these kinda things). I usually prefer pretentious thought provoking films (i know). I put this movie on with low expectations, and somehow from start to finish it kept me highly entertained. Although it was in parts very chiche, it didn't matter.

I'm very particular with the storyline and initially i don't want to watch it due to the some of the few bad word of mouth from my friends that it is very cliché,which honestly speaking its not compared to some of the ""fine "" movies which did well in the box office which is honestly clichéd,though Gravity is out of the list due to its originality.Its one of the best and underrated movies of all time and of 2013 and is sort of like The Avengers with a dash of Evangelion in it.It also brought me back a lot of my teen hood memories of watching anime and of being an otaku and slightly my inner child was being awaken.I've actually watched this movie due to my college project and initially I was reluctant to watch it,but I was very surprised that it does not turn out to be like what other people has said about this movie.Overall,its a great movie and if you do manage to buy it on Blu Ray or DVD or better still 3D Blu Ray,it was worth the money and it was worth the experience,as you can see the true grazing effects of the robots and the monsters which luckily the monsters did not creep me out like the clichéd Transformers movie series.So if you are considering watching a science fiction movie which is a good one,I'll highly recommend this movie as one of the best Science Fiction movie ever made."

","Contains many spoilers* To start with, the acting was up to standard and easy to believe and enjoy. The cast was fine too, loved the role of Idris Elba as man of authority and I liked how they handled the other actors' personal lives. However to a movie fan you get to notice those annoying little details and magnify them. Maybe it's just me. Anyways start of the movie,Charlie Hunnam is so fixed on the idea that he does not want to participate in the war, because he doesn't want to lose anyone else ? who ? I don't know he's the only member of his family still alive, is he talking about himself ? idk, weird, and then Idris Elba comes along and gives a literally one line speech and boom Charlie is in! The robot is carried deep into the mad restless ocean and the water is just up to the robots knee ? I mean c'mon. How deep is the water ? or how large is the robot ? that was not clear, I go fishing a lot, and everybody knows you don't fish in waters 10 feet deep. you look for 20or 30 or 40 ft. and that's just when you're trying to find fish. oceans are miles deep and to have waves you need at least 100 to 400 ft depth across a wide area. anyways see what the movie made me do ? I shouldn't be thinking about this stuf. the director should be thinking about it for me. and I get why nuclear weapons were not an option to use because you don't want to destroy aliens and the rest of the world, but you're engineering a building- sized robot and all he can do is punch and kick ? maybe in the 60's that would be fine. Ops, sorry, no. not even in the 60's. what kind of retarded robot can only punch and kick. Get with the times, there are tons of other weapons to equip them with, and I know they couldn't give the robots weapons because the movie would have been 5 mins maybe 6 mins tops and that right there is your sign that you should not make the movie. Then towards the end they showcase about ten robots and clearly identify the best one for combat. Another retarded glitch in the story. why not build all robots like that one ? and at the end there is a bridge ? ! why not nuke that bridge from the beginning ? oh, it would be a short movie, and you have to make it stupid to be long.

The first time i got fascinated with these Giant Mechs was from the 1980s cartoon ROBOTECH - and the way it was interpreted, man i have to say i dint know there were other earlier cartoons and anime like the Voltron (series) or the very first GUNDAM series.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of Guillermo Del Toro's work for a long time and i got to say the way the story has been told there's no way anyone else could have done it. Giant monsters coming from inter-dimensional portals from the center of the earth instead of space and countries coming together to build robots to battle these monsters all seems a bit childish and out of box even under the current circumstances. But all in the hands of an accomplished storyteller who has many other fantasy works under his belt well, this has to be his best work to date. All the actors involved and their character names all inspired from famous anime series have done their part well. Idris Elba from Luther and Charlie Hunnam from Sons of Anarchy were too good in their parts. A special mention of Rinko Kikochi too who was extremely cute for the role.<br/><br/>But why isn't the movie excellent well because its THE MOST AWESOME DUMB MOVIE OR THE DUMBEST AWESOME MOVIE ever. I mean all way the story dint have to pan out the way it was where i felt as the hero had a fake accent and Rinko sama with her weird accent. Yeah i know their story was will they, won't they format and dint quite get along. But all the way its movie that brings out our inner childhood dreams of Bot VS Monster saga on the silver screen which we needed and has been brought.<br/><br/>Thank you Guillermo because as of now i am waiting for ROBOTECH's turn and Godzilla remake which are along the way. And by the the soundtrack of the movie is simply awesome and the credit has to go to Ramin Djawadi of Prison Break, Game of thrones, and even Iron Man as well. Man if Hans Zimmer isn't going to score for Man of Steel sequel then at least he has to be on board for the soundtrack. Believe me guys i am typing the review listening to this OST.<br/><br/>PS: Don't watch the movie in 3D format but go for it on IMAX format if available or at least on bigger giant screens with better sound effects."

No its not the most original story, no the acting isn't the best, but the fight scenes are epic the monsters (kaiju) look fantastic, the jaegers are amazing and the actors appear to be having a cracking time of it (Charlie Hunnman has the biggest school boy grin in the beginning scene when first in the jaeger syncing up with his brother).<br/><br/>Overall as long as you go in to this and can level with the fact that the dialogue isn't going to be hugely important and yes the acting is a bit wooden, basically turn off your brain and you should thoroughly enjoy yourself."

","(For a ""will I like this movie"" guide, read the second paragraph)<br/><br/>First I'd like to say that I am going to attempt to not completely glorify this film nor will I absolutely bash it. I, for one, enjoyed this movie. Yes, I do admit that the story wasn't perfect in any way, some parts may lead to confusion, and then there is always the whole ""why didn't they do this? it would have been much more logical"" argument. Let's ignore that for a minute and focus on the selling point for this movie: GIANT ROBOT VS. ALIEN BATTLES. That is pretty much the only reason this movie took the interest of its audience in the first place. If you go into a movie like this expecting a wonderful romantic addition or an absolutely dramatic climax followed by a ""perfect ending,"" of course you will be disappointed! Let's be honest for a second, 90% of the time you know whether or not you will enjoy a movie by watching the trailer. So if you are completely in love with romantic comedies and nothing else, this probably isn't the movie for you (and therefore you shouldn't post your hate reviews on this movie.) Now, for those of you who are into futuristic action movies, you will probably enjoy this movie. No, this movie doesn't have a strong story. No, this movie doesn't have amazing acting. No, this movie doesn't always make sense. But, what it does have is a cool concept and pretty darn good action. I honestly believe that this movie deserves the rating this website has. When watching it, just remember that this movie lives up to its selling point: Giant Robots vs. Aliens, that's all it is. <br/><br/>""Will I Like This Movie?"" <br/><br/>Now the only reason you're reading this review is to decide whether or not you want to watch this movie. To assist you in this, I will ask you a few questions: <br/><br/>1) Does giant robots vs. giant aliens sound interesting? <br/><br/>2) Do you enjoy well animated sci-fi fighting scenes? <br/><br/>3) Does carnage of entire cities interest you? <br/><br/>4) Do you have nothing better to do for the next 2 hours and 11 minutes? <br/><br/>If you answered yes to any of these questions, watch this movie. <br/><br/>4) Did you hate Transformers? <br/><br/>5) Do you need a ""perfect"" story line to enjoy a movie? <br/><br/>6) Do you have an appointment in an hour?<br/><br/>If you answered yes to any of these question, it probably isn't in your best interest to watch this movie; but if you do, don't complain when you hate it."
"TaZmAnOO7","1","10","20","17 July 2013"," Terrible Movie. Nothing but CGI.
","Just saw this movie in 3D - was expecting so much given the hype and the fact that Guillermo Del Toro was directing, but it was a total let down. Everyone I watched this movie with thought the same.<br/><br/>This movie was a complete borefest and consisted of nothing but CGI?? Seriously - there was nothing else. The acting was wooden and mediocre and every moment was full of cheese. The script was non existent. Where was the story?? The whole movie was as if the entire CGI department was just vomiting everything they possibly could on screen. It is CGI overload. Don't get me wrong - The CGI is good - no problems there, however, there is literally no film or story here to watch. You didn't care about any of the characters and everything was totally predictable from start to finish. Everything was repetitive. As if all the above wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack for the film was abysmal - the tune was repetitive, amateur and majorly annoying. It was like a kid messing with his keyboard playing the same few keys - seriously, whoever did the music in this film should be out of a job. <br/><br/>This film is for a seriously dumb audience without any intelligence - I'm amazed at how much money and CGI was thrown at this movie given the total lack of story and script. This is without doubt Guillermo's worst movie in history. He has messed up big time with this movie. He seems to have forgot the absolute basics in movie making. Have a story to tell at the very least. There is no story, no script, no decent acting or anything. The movie is full of brainless stereotyping too - it's embarrassing and like a child made this movie. There is nothing to keep you interested. CGI does not make a movie good - when will Hollywood learn this?? You will not see a better example of this fact than watching this movie."

","Saw this in the theater on the last days if the run. I had been seeing ads on TV and watched the trailers. Maybe that's what made me disappointed , watching the trailer. But the movie jumps into the ""people in robot suits"" too soon. I wanted to see more about the Godzilla monster at first. The story is so far from what the trailers show it is pathetic. <br/><br/>So if you want to see a Japanese transformers meets Godzilla style movie you will like pacific rim. It's about robot suits and robot suit pilots, no more. Not much in the way of scenes showing how it all started, maybe 10 minutes total as part of a narrative.<br/><br/>A little of Del Toros Hellboy look is present, as is a little Pans Labyrinth look, but overall a predictable children's movie with virtually no surprises."

We are doing scientific research into the illegals and why they are coming here and we also build mechanisms to deal with them directly but, Republicans are apparently in power and they cut funding for all scientific research and people dealing directly with the illegals and opt instead to build a wall around the Pacific Ocean. The illegals easily breech this wall and all looks lost. Fortunately, scientists manage to continue their research, solve the problem and stop the immigration problem at its source."

And its not a good kind of blend. - the attempt of humour in this movie sometimes remind me of the mentally challenged individuals in Idiocracy - gross mismatches across the story, parts of the story that clearly don't belong in this movie (when talking about style of the story) </li></ul><br/><br/>Good things: <br/><br/><ul><li>awesome special effects, best I've seen in years.</li></ul><br/><br/>This movie clearly shows that if you through enough money in the CGI department, you will probably get hugely successful movie, no matter how crappy the story and the characters were.<br/><br/>The story had some potential, but it required for the producers of this film to spend a little bit on scene writers that can write and on actors not hired from former Ronald McDonald impersonator. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I am ashamed to see this movie receiving a 7.5 mark on IMDb. Ashamed of the fact that these are the viewers nowadays. It used to mean something to have a 7.5 on IMDb. With the mental decline of the current viewers, now...it means nothing."

","I can't say much about this movie that I wastefully just spent money on, except that it was visually pretty good. The story was written by a 5 year old. The Reasons plot lines happen in the movie was so that a cheap answer to them could be made with cool visual effects. So other than cgi, Its just cheap plain and simple. If I was 5 years old I would probably love it, but then again, I was pretty dumb then and had no idea of what the good writing of a story actually was. Sorry, I am very critical, but if you are going to spend millions making a movie, why would you spend ten dollars writing the story of it? Doesn't make sense to me."

","A disgraceful film, where cliché appears every time the main characters open their mouths to say bullshit. The plot is one of the weakly I ever saw in a film. The special effects are definitely the high point of the 131 minutes you are going to lose in your life if you decide to watch it. In some parts of the movie it looks like the viewer went back in time and is watching ""Power Rangers"" again. And not to mention the pointless dialog that go along all the scenes. If you are looking for more than special effects I strongly recommend to do not watch this crap, but if you really like this in a film, just watch Transformers or Battleship. At least these other two will not make you sorry to have waste time and money."

"Michael Kenmore","4","13","29","13 July 2013"," Pacific Rim looked promising, but turns out a major disappointment
","This review should be prefaced by the fact that I never saw the preview before coming to see the movie, so I was not needlessly spoiled to know the details and visuals of the movie, except a few publicity photos that piqued my interest.<br/><br/>Much have been said about the movie by some noteworthy reviewers who reacted negatively. Suffice to say I found the movie to be an overambitious yet tepid attempt, which led to my struggle to sit through the movie, partly bored and mostly offended, for the reasons to be outlined by me.<br/><br/>First, the visual effects and colorfully vibrant cinematography, in conjunction with 3-D, are spectacular, but occasionally bombastic and redundant. What matters is the story and proper characterization with plausible and non-cringeworthy dialogue, which is difficult to pull off in a big concept movie like Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>I found the characterization of German-descent roles offensive in perpetuating the stereotype, such as the ""dorky"" mathematician, on top of ethnic stereotyping. In my mind, the most offensive stereotype in the movie is the irritatingly patronizing military leader played by Idris Elba, who might be familiar as having starred as the Norse God Heimdallr in the revisionist adaptation of ""Thor"".<br/><br/>Despite the backstory established in the first ten minutes, the movie never felt right, only frequently dull due to the feeling of ""deja vu"" (having seen some big monster and mecha movies) and redundant monster versus mecha fight scenes.<br/><br/>I came to see the movie, expecting a fun ride. But this movie is certainly not fun, at least pertaining to the questionable story arcs, occasional cringeworthy corny dialogue, stilted acting, excessively bombastic visual effects and production design (""eye candy""), disturbing scenes of violence that pushes PG-13 rating boundary, and, of course, stereotype and cliché galore.<br/><br/>I noted the general audience's mood was not quite receptive to Pacific Rim after the conclusion. Muted and perplexed reaction. I knew what I'm getting into, being familiar with mecha (the glacial but riveting Patlabor anime movies), but this movie just feels flat-out mediocre, which lends to disappointed feeling in deflated expectation.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is certainly an overambitious movie, with the co-writer and director Guillermo del Toro being aggravatingly self-indulgent as usual like in his preceding movies (I remember Pan's Labyrinth being obnoxiously didactic with gory violence when it came out in theatres to the audience's disgusted reaction).<br/><br/>The movie is in essence childish in its reverence for self-serving moralistic approach, smirk-evoking cheese (in particular stilted acting & overacting with some eye-rolling dialogue), visual spectacle and PG-13-stretching violence.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is almost a good movie director, but he self-sabotages by focusing on the repetition and clichés, which not even film editing could save by excising some lame and extraneous scenes. (It is said the movie has an hour of extra footage.) Del Toro is one of the ultimate ""geek"" movie directors, the other his best friend James Cameron, but somehow Del Toro falls back on the standard clichés and stereotypes with the ""more is more"" bloated spectacle, which leads to the frustration of watching the movie as it repeatedly sabotages itself that lends to dull and exasperated feeling, which may explain the audience's near-universal negative impression.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim has some merits, such as the astoundingly high production values, but the factors described above basically killed the movie in terms of mere enjoyment. The movie seems to mock the audience by patronizing attitude with stereotypical characterization, redundant monster versus mecha fight sequences that feel padded out and ineptly manipulative emotional scenes that feel dishonest.<br/><br/>This is Guillermo del Toro's ""toy movie,"" not unlike Michael Bay who fundamentally destroyed The Transformers with the regressively worse sequels to seek the box office fortune.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim would have been a fun movie, but, unfortunately, it is not. Perhaps Del Toro needs the lesson how James Cameron succeeds in producing the consistently and thoroughly entertaining movies, which do not directly or indirectly insult the audience, that result in box office records.<br/><br/>The movie is consigned to mediocrity by the reason of self-sabotage that belie Guillermo del Toro's impressively ambitious & creative energy yet might be tempered by the patronizingly smug attitude. Pacific Rim just feels dull and forgettable by the time the show is over, which makes it a truly ""half-assed"" movie.<br/><br/>** out of 4"

The movie basically looks like a cartoon. The monsters aren't scary or even remotely believable. For effective, believable use of CGI, refer to Lord of the Rings, Star Trek or King Kong. <br/><br/>Perhaps my nine year old would like this movie, which i may comprehend.

","I knew we were in serious trouble when it took 2/3 of the movie for the giant robot pilots to realize equipping their rock-em sock-em robots with swords might be helpful against giant monsters made of meat and bone...<br/><br/>This movie is obviously a Japanese comic converted to an American movie. How strange then that there is one and only one Japanese character in the movie, a ridiculous scientist/robot pilot slash giggling schoolgirl because she has a crush on the lead character.<br/><br/>There have been countless movies now about giant robots, and for some reason the robots in this franchise show up with nearly no weaponry, save for a plasma cannon on their hand that they strangely always save for the final blows, when they could be using it blow pieces off the charging rhinocerous like beasts on their first charge.<br/><br/>Another bizarre item is the robots are flown around by fleets of Chinook helicopters, which would never work in real life and even CGI'd looks completely fake and unrealistic. Most of the robots are nuclear powered, why not give them jets so they can fly themselves in??

"seancram","7","6","11","1 August 2013"," The most intelligent monster movie you'll ever see
","In the year 2020, a dimensional portal opens up in the Pacific Ocean, and our world is besieged by giant monsters called Kaiju (Japanese for 'strange creature'). In response, humanity created large robots called Jaegars (German for 'hunter') to fight these creatures. Unfortunately, the Kaiju are winning, and it's up to a washed-up former pilot and a rookie to save humanity from being annihilated. Pacific Rim is the brainchild of Guillermo Del Toro, visionary director of such visually striking films as Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth. Pacific Rim isn't a remake or a movie 'based on anything' (aside from Del Toro's love of old-school monster movies), which is refreshing considering Hollywood's nauseating obsession with sequels, remakes, and superhero comic adaptions.<br/><br/>First, and foremost, the CGI in Pacific Rim is some of the best you will ever see. The Jaegars and Kaiju look awesome, especially when they are beating the tar out of each other (and destroy cities in the process). It is definitely worth the 3D upcharge. Del Toro's film also features a well-developed and colorful cast that keeps the film from being 'all-style no-substance', like similar big-budget action films like Transformers and Battleship. A noteworthy performance comes from Dr. Newton Geiszler (played by Charlie Day of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia fame), a very enthusiastic and easily-excitable scientist that provides some big laughs and crucial insight into the Kaiju and how to defeat them. Ron Perlman has a memorable, but brief role as the Black Market Kaiju organ dealer Hannibal Chou (whose name comes from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Chinese restaurant). Details like how the robots operate, where the monsters come from and some of their biological facts (often provided animatedly by the aforementioned Doctor) are not only clever, but they give the world a certain degree of plausibility, another feature often absent from similar films. There is also a quick scene mid-credits which is worth sticking around for.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is not without flaws, though. At points, the dialogue was hard to hear, although this may have been the theater's fault. A few moments in the film will cause viewers to think ""Why didn't they just do that before?"" For example: towards the end of the second act, the Jaegar piloted by the two main heroes suddenly unveils a blade attachment that can slice a Kaiju with ease, clearly more effective than punching and throwing said beast for 10 minutes (though admittedly less exciting). The fight scenes in the second act are so thrilling and over-the-top that the third act feels short and weak in comparison. While the cast is strong and there are surprisingly few cliché/cheesy lines, the rookie and the washed-up pilot (the two main heroes) are not as well-developed as some of the other characters. All of the battle scenes are a treat to watch, but they take place either in the pouring rain or underwater. This doesn't deter from the enjoyment of the film, but to watch the two opposing forces duke it out on a sunny day (or even a cloudy one) would've be nice, so we could see them more clearly.<br/><br/>The good far outweighs the bad when it comes to Pacific Rim, and you probably won't ever see a more fun or intelligent monster movie. 7 Robots out of 10"

"LadyComplainer","10","6","11","28 July 2013"," Not Transformers Meets Power Rangers at all
","Though I wanted to start out with ""A movie that is the combination of Power Rangers meet Transformers"" That is not the case In fact this movie was very good with keeping a story and not just action. The plot was easy to follow and the action was consistent with it.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim takes places not far from us now (2017-2022). Monsters are real or more accurate is ""Godzilla"" if he lived in the water and looked more. um Water monstery World becomes very different as the ""water Godzilla"" monsters attack the world. They come out of the water near Hong Kong, China. The way that the story in this movie makes it is that they are coming from the core Almost like a body in the core. They call it ""The Throat"". These monsters come up and destroy EVERYTHING<br/><br/>By the time the world finally figures out how to destroy the monsters, robots are made to help Really really really BIG robots that (of course) almost look like Transformers. To control these gigantic robot machines, you have to have someone controlling them. A team is created and together they come up with a way for the human brain to control the movements. At first it is just the general fighting, by the end of the movie they have swords and knives. To make things even more unique and interesting, it takes TWO people to control the machine. They put on a robotic type suit and get synced in, however, they are not just synced into the robot, they are synced with each other. They can read each others mind and feel memories.<br/><br/>Our top team that takes care of the main machine is Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket and Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori. Together they kick butt and take names. They take orders from General Pentecost (Idris Elba). They have the help from two scientists: one that believes that numbers are the answer and the other that believes that science itself is the answer. These brains are played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman. They also have help from Becket's old friend Herc Hansen (Max Martini).<br/><br/>I do recommend this movie to both male and female audience. Kids I think will love it too. Probably just as the rating goes for age 13 and up. This movie is just over 2 hours long so I would suggest going to a theater that has unlimited drink refills and a large bag of popcorn and candy. Make sure you use the restroom before the previews are over cause you won't want to miss a moment of this excellent action packed movie."

","If compare ""Pacific Rim"" with other films about struggle with monstrous invaders, i would describe it in just few words: Godzilla meets transformers. As this movie about REAL-BIG-THINGS (i mean, things are really big when you see these on a screen first time), Del Toro focusing exactly on them, unlike other directors of such films. No unnecessary dialogues, only clear and simple plot. In contrast to the similar sci-fi action films, where there is tedious break between a beginning and final scene,Del Toro doesn't allow himself such. You will no doubt have fun and don't notice how time flew. So, if you don't wanna miss the great battle between human beings and most vile creatures who ever attacked our planet, you definitely should see this film."

That being said this film's technical aspects are perfect in every way. While watching I felt myself gripping my seat as the Jaegers fought the Kaiju. Everything is bigger than life for 2+ hours from the mechs to the actors. The story was more in depth then what I anticipated but still nothing to write home about. The acting, while over the top was superb because it fits with the overall premise of the film... Plus Charlie Day, Idris Elba, and Ron Perlman were perfect for these caricatures.

","Pretty much the textbook definition of ""fun summer movie"", Pacific Rim takes a Lovecraftian scenario with giant Cthulhu-like monsters (""kaiju"") popping out of a portal in the middle of the ocean and mankind building giant robots to face them.<br/><br/>Visuals are striking, with humongous reptilian creatures rising from the waves under a pouring rain and spectacular battles in cities laid to waste.<br/><br/>The most interesting gimmick is how Mechs (""Jaegers"") require two pilots to work, and they need to share a neural connection: the better their mutual understanding, the more effective the robot. A promising plot point which could have been explored more.<br/><br/>The script is serviceable. It moves fast and introduces some basic relationships and conflicts, like the broken hero who lost a loved one (Charlie Hunnam), the rookie with a personal vendetta against the monsters (cute Rinko Kikuchi), the stoic gravel-voiced leader (Idris Elba), the arrogant rival like Iceman in Top Gun - who, incidentally, is quite indistinguishable from the protagonist: if you cast two blonde guys with similar faces, age, height and build, and even put space suits on them, at least give one a moustache or something. Minor characters like the Russian and Chinese pilots are so sketchily drawn they come across as caricatures.<br/><br/>Del Toro has reportedly been struggling for years to adapt Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness. Pacific Rim evokes Lovecraftian imagery, but is essentially an attempt to take the sting out of it (more palatable to a mass audience!) by adding heroic characters, romance and an optimistic tone.<br/><br/>From a director of Del Toro's caliber I was expecting something more special and personal, but a competent, entertaining blockbuster is already a cause of minor celebration in these days.<br/><br/>6,5/10"
"uncertainwonder-1","8","6","11","18 July 2013"," A literal block buster with heart
","I can summarize this movie in two words: Bad. Ass.<br/><br/>It is obviously inspired by the classic Japanese animated series ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", which was itself influenced by earlier ""kaiju movies"" like Godzilla. It's about a portal to another dimension that opens up deep in the ocean. Big monsters (appropriately called ""kaiju"") come out of it and trash coastal cities. The world bands together and makes giant human-controlled robots to go fight them.<br/><br/>And that's really the whole plot.<br/><br/>But that's not the whole movie. There is also a real heart to the story. Several characters have survived trauma and use each other to work through the issues. The movie is genuinely multi-cultural without bothering to point that out. And in the end, it's a lesson about teamwork, also without directly pointing it out.<br/><br/>The monster fights redefine the word ""epic"". Director Guillermo del Toro has taken to heart the phrase ""go big or go home"". He doesn't go home. He has no problem destroying entire cities (but he does take care to evacuate them first. This is not a violent bloodbath movie).<br/><br/>Del Toro knows that these stories can get corny, so he preempts it by steering directly into cheesy humor. There's a super geeky subplot about two scientists competing to come up with the best solution, and Ron Perlman gives a great over-the-top performance of a black market trafficker in monster body parts. Everybody knows they're being ridiculous, so it works.<br/><br/>This is not a deep, socially relevant film about existential problems. It's not even all that original. I mean, it's a giant robot fight movie. But by zeroing in on what makes those movies work, Guillermo del Toro has managed to achieve something really rare - to make me feel like a kid again. It made me remember the old Godzilla movies; watching the larger-than-life battles between things that would make me feel so small... but knowing that with the right people around me, I could slay monsters."

"saytosandeep","8","6","11","18 July 2013"," MY REVIEW: Big Action in Big Pacific
","Pacific Rim. I was not very interested in it after watching trailer. I thought it just looks like another action packed CGI movie on big creatures like Transformers and I am happy I proved myself wrong by giving it a try. Yes it's like Transformers where everything is too big to fit in even IMAX screen but treatment is where it scores. It doesn't take too much time to make a plot for its big action sequences. The threat is there from the very first scene, where Kaijus (An Asian legend on the lines of Godzila) can vanish the whole human race. So humans created big robots Jaegars operated by two pilots at a time to fight them and the whole movie is about how it all ends. The whole movie is so much fun to watch that you feel like a kid enjoying WWF fight on big screen. The whole movie is another excellent example of CGI visuals and creatures and it gets even better with immersive 3D experience. Characters and twists are predictable but they are never overdone. Dialogues are funny at times. Performances are average. All in all, you won't like to blink throughout the movie because you don't want to miss the punches Jaegars make to Kaijus. I hope there will be a sequel to it because this effort needs to be rewarded."

"ollie1939-97-957994","6","6","11","17 July 2013"," Get ready to become a 11 year old again
","Pacific Rim is a movie that could possibly lower your IQ as well as anger people expecting the next Pan's Labryinth from Guillermo Del Toro. However it's an entertaining film that hasn't been the disappointment that some of the other blockbusters have been this year. Pacific Rim is essentially a mixture of Transformers, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and Godzilla movies. The basic plot for the movie is that giant monsters called Kaiju have come from another dimension deep in the earth's core. As a result humans build giant robots called Jaegers to stop the Kaiju attack. As you can see the story is paper thin with very little character development or background to the film. It is also filled with clichéd characters and more action than Transformers or the Avengers had. If you can get past this you will be transported to the mind of a 11 year old excited at the prospect of seeing giant robots and aliens fighting it out. The action and the CGI are the main reasons and the best parts about the movie. There isn't a lot of shaky cam in the fight sequences which is a good thing. The CGI is incredibly detailed with you actually seeing parts of the Jaegar's body flying off its body. The Kaiju also look very realistic. Despite the weak character development the actors do a good job with what they're giving. Charlie Hunnam(from Sons of Anarchy) and Rinko Kikuchi do a fine job as our main hero's. Charlie Day( from It's always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Burn Gorman do good jobs as the comedic relief for the movie. Ron Perlman and Idris Elba are the two stand out performances just because these two guys are the biggest bad asses in the whole of the movie( with the exception of the giant robots. Overall the movie is good despite its weak character development and paper thin story. It makes you feel like an 11 year old again and it will probably be the most entertaining action film of the whole summer."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","6","11","16 July 2013"," This is how all Hollywood blockbusters should be.
","Despite a few too many Guillermo del Toro fantasy movies leaving me cold, particularly with the overrated Pan's Labyrinth, for some reason, I had hope that Pacific Rim would be my Summer hit of the year. It's felt too much like there's not been anything genuine to be excited about with Iron Man 3, Man Of Steel, World War Z and The Lone Ranger to name a few, not satisfying audiences. Although I'm not a fan of Transformers or the other monster movies that are obvious influences, I had hope that Del Toro's art-house sense of cinema would blend well with the Hollywood inevitable attributes, as the latter is the price to pay for a movie of this epic scale. I enjoyed Hellboy back in the day but sometimes it got a little too dark and serious to be fun whereas Pacific Rim looked like a ball from start to finish. And it most certainly is. While too many Summer movies of the last decade find themselves swallowed up by their paint-by- numbers plot with any random thing filling in the gaps, Pacific Rim finds a great balance between the plot and the characters' stories, helped by its talented cast plucked from TV, especially Charlie Hunnam and Charlie Day, my personal favourite.<br/><br/>Its script is constantly surprising and intriguing, even if structurally predictable, and it sets up its world in a fascinating way in those first few minutes. Although it can be melodramatic, whenever it dragged it picked itself back up again and set the stakes back in motion. It's an absolute delight to have a movie with actual set-pieces to balance out with the all-CGI world too, I just love the inside the Jaeger set. However, admittedly, there are times when the action is frustratingly cluttered, it has awesome and truly involving moments that completely make up for those moments of confusion. A scale like this hasn't been touched since The Lord Of The Rings and here it's is utterly awe-spiring. But what makes it special is that the action always means something to the characters and the plot and is never there for the sake of banal excitement. It has a great sense of humour too though sometimes it can be a bit too campy but that seems to be the lashings of Del Toro's style. Nevertheless, Pacific Rim is one of the most entertaining blockbusters in a long, long time thanks to its characters, great writing and creative epic special effects. This is how it's done.<br/><br/>7/10"
"rbmaclachlan","8","6","11","14 July 2013"," Great movie that delivers great action heart and soul.
","Saw this movie yesterday and came away with a feeling that finally a movie like this has been made in the right way because this movie was inspired by the anime mecca movies and cartoons and I think that Del toro did his research very well as he always does in bringing this type of movie to life. I think one of the things that struck me about this movie deeply was the fact the robots was controlled by humans which to me gave the robots purpose and drive you feel for the robots because they are manned by humans there was never a point were during the movie the action lacked because as i said before Del toro thought very carefully about what he wanted to show in regards to action story and detail to me he is a director who takes great pride in what he does and he wants it done in the right way and I respect that greatly. <br/><br/>I would just like to say to all the people who are comparing it to transformers that is fine and your opinion but they are only similar because they are giant robots and that is it in my opinion Michael Bay needs to take notes respect his craft because he from what he has given with transformers has really make it look very all money no heart and that is not what it is about."

"mkc1218","2","11","24","14 July 2013"," Guillermo del TOHO presents... Pacific Dim-witted
","The year 2009 will be marked as the year in which science fiction films changed ADULT movie-going audiences – at least temporarily.<br/><br/>In this post Avatar/District 9 world, adult filmgoers want and expect more from their sci fi. They aren't satisfied with aliens blowing up the world just for the hell of it any longer, no matter how cool the explosions. Been there, done that.<br/><br/>Avatar and D9 reminded us all that sci fi is most powerful and emotionally satisfying when it has something to say, when the future comments on life in the present. Pacific Rim not only has nothing to say, it says it with way too many words.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim takes sci fi cinema back 50 years – and in this case retro is not a good thing. It's Destroy All Monsters meets The Thunderbirds (and more than a touch of Independence Day). It's a production and story more suited for Japanese actors and bad dubbing than for Hollywood.<br/><br/>Isn't that giant dinosaur-like monster just a Man In A Monster Suit trampling over a scale model of Tokyo?<br/><br/>Where is Raymond Burr?<br/><br/>Our weapons have no effect!!!<br/><br/>Is Godzilla good in this one, or bad?!<br/><br/>Mindless destruction of the planet and special effects can't draw large audiences above the age of puberty, for the moment anyway. 2009's mindless destruction of the planet in ""2012"" was our last goodbye for that type of fare – for a while anyway. If Elysium, with it's class warfare theme, is a huge hit then I think my analysis that 2009 was a monumental year in sci fi cinema will be proved correct.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is so dim-witted, childish, derivative, and insulting to the audience that studio heads should roll. The whole film feels like a big budget episode of the Power Rangers – only without the really hot pink Power Ranger to take our mind off the on-screen stupidity.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro, generally a terrific and imaginative storyteller, should change his last name to del TOHO in honor of the film company behind Japan's great monster movies.<br/><br/>How strange it will be for Japanese audiences to see a giant monster film dubbed FROM English! It even has the bombastic, Godzilla-like soundtrack nailed perfectly.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim might be a tribute to monster movies of old, but it's a genre not deserving of this childish tribute. At least not from Hollywood. And definitely not for $20 – yes, IMAX 3D cost me $20 here in New York. I could have seen the same movie for free on television at 3 a.m. and have laughed at all the shortcomings – and even enjoyed some of them in the way that bad sci fi can be fun. But the same shortcomings at $20 are a whole lot less amusingly goofball.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim seems to have been created for no other reason than to sell monster toys and robot toys. Instead of turning a toy franchise into a movie franchise, it seems the studio was aiming for the reverse. I don't know how the movie will perform internationally, but here in America it seems that Pacific Rim will generate tons of unsold toy store plastic that will need recycling. Definitely appropriate for the BIG, three dimensional recycling job I saw last night.<br/><br/>(No need to talk about plot or character. It's all tangential to the robot/monster battles. I will say, however, that seeing Idris Elba slumming in this picture is very sad. Watch the first couple episodes of his BBC show ""Luther."")<br/><br/>Two stars out of 10.<br/><br/>I would rather have been mining coal."

Some acting might have been nice, too; the writing and performances were mostly cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>There were a couple of nice scenes concerning the hazards of interfacing the pilots' minds with the robot controls, but otherwise, it was a predictable, insulting exercise in ridiculous, physics-defying scenario-building and advertising for a range of action figure toys."

With poorly developed characters, this is nothing but a movie cartoon. Now that is probably fine for many movie goers and if that's what you like, fine!

"ironhorse_iv","8","7","14","18 July 2013"," This film is an amazing tribute film to Japanese Kaiju and Mecha Genre
","It's a great summer blockbuster movie! This was a fun ride. Director Guillermo Del Toro did a great job. It's outshine the Transformers series way up! I don't think the movie was ripping off a lot of Japanese Kaiju movies like 1954's Gojira and others, but making tribute to them. I saw a lot of plot references from other Japanese mecha works such as 1979's Mobile Suit Gundam, 1995's Neon Genesis Evangelion, 1989's Gunhead. I do also see a lot of references from American films such as 1989's Robot Jox, and 1993's Power Rangers as well. I like to see Mechas and Kaiju monster fighting against each other, so this movie was a treat. It's 100% badass. The film was very good in terms of visual effects. It had some good CGI effects. The movie starts out in 2020s (Honestly, they should have move the date up more) with an invasion of alien monstrous creatures call Kaiju, started rising from the Pacific Ocean from a portal from a different dimension wreaking havoc on humanity. To combat the giant Kaijus, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But more and more Kaijus continue to enter the portal, more than the Jaegers could be build and pilots could be train. On the verge of defeat, the only hope for mankind is a last ditch attempt to seal the portal once and for all. I do have to say, I love the acting in this film. Nobody really kept it down. I love Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket, the washed up former pilot who has to team up with an untested trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) to control the Jaeger robot Gypsy Danger. I think Mako Mori is a very strong female character that hold up her own in the film and girls can look up to. It's nice seeing a strong Japanese character portray like this, then the dumb eye candy that follows the main character around. The person that made the film was Idris Elba as Marshall Stacker Pentecost. He's so commanding in the role. I do have to say that the other characters were walking stereotypes. Charles Day as the over the top scientist, Ron Perlman as the black market kaiju organ dealer gangster Hannibal Chau, and Robert Kazinsky as the hot shot Top Gun's 'Iceman"" type pilot that is there just to be a jerk. While there is abundant Clichés and stereotypical characters. There was a pretty good emotional scene in the middle of the film that I love. Mako's flashback of her as a kid and the absence of other people emphasizes the terror she felt being all alone and chased by a kaiju. That little girl that portray a young Mako did an amazing job and I really felt for her, and the way she was holding on to her shoe was a highly powerful representation of her shock and fear, she was clasping to it for comfort and in that situation at that age. I do like how the film fits how the characters got to know each other by drifting. The mind meld drifting was still somewhat unclear. Using one right and another person left hemisphere to make one brain is confusing. I felt it was trying too hard to be 2010's Inception with this. Would repeat handshakes fill in the gaps that they apparently had? If they were wholly in each others' minds, do they really need to talk to each other? When the scientist drifted with the nearly dead brain piece how did the kaiju track him down? Why couldn't the kaiju just terraform the planet themselves and they kill the dinosaurs? It pose more questions than answers. The science in this doesn't make any sense at all, but after all it's a Sci-fiction movie, it doesn't have too. Honestly there were some things they could have cut such as the whole wall discussion and the side adventures of the scientist. It was stupid. They could have fit more time with the Jaegers. I was bit disappointed with the other Jaegers screen time. The action is amazing. I wish more daytime fights scenes with the monsters and more use of the sword. At less, give these Jaegers guns so they have more fighting chance. I can barely see what is going on with the night scenes. I think it's worth checking out in the theater. You will miss a lot if you don't go there. Just don't see it in 3D. 3D was annoying as it's hard to see due to 3D rain and snow. Everything was so dark, which hurts watching it in 3D. Everything happens at night for some reason, or underwater, or underwater at night, so it's hard to tell what's going on with in those scenes with the glasses on. Watching it on D-Box Simulators is interesting, but gimmicky. Very entertaining. The division of the film I think that cinema is moving towards a remarkable development and a very good overall story of the film is not original but exciting for the viewer. The Japanese have been making movies like this for years. Just without the fantastic CGI effects. So check out Pacific Rim!"

"hiddenhippo","2","5","9","26 May 2014"," Go into this for the effects and you won't be disappointed
","Unfortunately, if you expect anything more than special effects you'll be sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>The film starts by giving a good insight into the state of the world at the time, constantly assailed by monsters, but sadly this doesn't really develop at all over the course of the film. It had the potential to be a developing idea, but failed to do so.<br/><br/>The acting was wooden throughout, with only Idris Elba giving what could be called as a passable performance. The two scientists, played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, were quite possibly the most annoying characters I've seen in a film. Charlie Day seemed incapable of moderating the tone of his voice, such that every single line was shouted in an annoying nasal whine to the extent I was rooting for the monsters. Burn Gorman on the other hand just managed to make a character so grating that I zoned out whenever he was on screen. Unfortunately, it is not just Charlie Day who needed to shout every line, but every character, meaning that any emotion that should be present in a scene was lost to a constant shout.<br/><br/>This brings me onto the character development. There is none. The middle 45 minutes really wants you to try and identify with the characters, and they do try, but unfortunately he script writing is so bland and predictable that you cannot engage with them in the slightest. At no point did I become attached to a character, or feel inspired by a speech.<br/><br/>Finally, the effects. Whilst the film is terrible, the effects were fantastic. There were some stunning scenes in which the robots (Jaegers) looked utterly titanic and the monsters (Kaiju) utterly gargantuan. However, they were generic - there was nothing especially inspired about their design.<br/><br/>Overall, good visual effects, terrible script, direction, character development and acting."

But even they were interesting only if you're into special effects. All members of the crew offer sub-par performance.

It's like watching Power Rangers. As good as the CGI was at one point I was convinced I was watching actors in rubber/metal suite fight over a miniature city. In fact it's like watching those old Japanese Godzilla movies, but nowhere near as good (and they were bad).<br/><br/>It was painful watching this. The acting is horrendous. And just when you think it can't get any worse, it gets worse.

Avengers had a predictable story as well, but at least there was action that kept you entertained) <br/><br/>What REALLY REALLY ruined the movie is the ABYSMAL acting performance you are insulted with as a viewer. <br/><br/>I can't fathom how anyone could give this movie more than a 5/10 after seeing these 2 scientists ""act"" - it is by far the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie with this budget. Even students that shoot a movie for fun and never had any acting experience are BY FAR more authentic in front of a camera than these two amateurs. <br/><br/>Apart from them, the other actors weren't outstanding either, but that may have been due to the fact that the characters were designed flat and boring without any special features.

"Radu_A","8","5","9","28 July 2013"," some anime tips for those of you who are not J-nerds
","A lot's been said, personally I felt PR to be the most entertaining summer film so far. It was definitely worth the 3D extra charge, and should definitely be seen in a theater - without a first-class sound system and on a smaller screen, there's not much point in watching this.<br/><br/>Since PR is Hollywood's first deep dive into the mecha (fighting robot) world, those of you who are not too fascinated by things Japanese may not know where much of the inspiration for this came from. So here's a few anime tips in case you got curious. In a way, the B.O. indicates that this kind of thing may work better with audiences in the animated form.<br/><br/>Everybody in the world should be familiar with Evangelion. Then again, the original is from 1995-96, so some younger folks may not be. The 'Eva' mecha are the obvious inspiration for the Jaeger's design. Three visually updated relaunch movies have been released: 'Evangelion 1.0. You are not alone' (2007), www.imdb.com/title/tt0923811, 'Evangelion 2.0. You can (not) advance' (2009), www.imdb.com/title/tt0860906, and 'Evangelion 3.0: You can (not) redo' (2012), www.imdb.com/title/tt0860907. The films are less philosophical than the original 26 episode series. For that reason, however, it's the perfect introduction to mecha anime for anyone who's enjoyed PR, but found the story too flat/silly.<br/><br/>Similar mecha anime with better stories would be 'Aquarion' (2005, 26 episodes, same 'fusion of mecha pilots' angle), 'Broken Blade' (2010-11, 6 OVAs, fantasy mecha battle epic with the same melodrama), the highly recommended 'Code Geass' (2008/2012, 50 episodes, alternative evil empire history with super powers), 'Gargantia' (2013, 13 episodes, similar monsters), and 'Macross Frontier' (2008-09, 26 episodes, similar monsters with space opera and singing).<br/><br/>If you're looking for an anime currently airing which best defines the difference between this entertainment form and film, has an interesting story and is recklessly cool, try 'Attack on Titan' (www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140). Be warned, you may be hooked and become a J-nerd yourself. But don't resist the fun, go with the zeitgeist."
"jeffpk","8","5","9","20 July 2013"," A loving tribute to anime and kaiju
","Pacific Rim is a live action mashup of giant robot anime and classic rubber-suit kaiju movies (eg Godzilla).<br/><br/>Being a Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) movie, it has a strong, bold and lavish sense of visual style. It is clear that Del Toro both knows and loves both of the movie traditions he is drawing on but also suffuses the movie with a Hollywood sensibility, all without an obvious clash or discord.<br/><br/>The plot is not deep, in fact as anime it would be on the markedly shallow side. There is none of the philosophical musings or mythological literacy that underlies good anime. It is, in the end, about as deep as a Godzilla film. The characters are shallowly drawn with obvious motivations. The plot is pretty minimal with most of the movie being spent on action sequences.<br/><br/>In the end, my review is much like my review of Avatar. Its a B action movie. But what a B action movie!<br/><br/>I saw it in IMAX 3D and, if you can, its definitely worth the extra few bucks. The movie is visually stunning, exciting in its action sequences, and in the end just a whole lot of fun for anyone else who loves the source genres.<br/><br/>Which certainly includes me."

","I was so ready not to like ""Pacific Rim"". It seemed just like another one of those ""giant robot movies that are just all noise and nothing else. Fortunately though, it was a good thing that it was the only movie beginning when I got to the mall this morning. This is so much better than the ""Transformers"" clone I was afraid it would be.<br/><br/>""Pacific Rim"" takes place in the year 2020 (not really in the very far future, isn't it?) and the world is under attack from gigantic monsters coming from ocean depths called Kaiju. As the tag line tells us, ""to fight the monsters, we created monsters of our own."" These are in the form of so-called giant mechanical fighting soldiers called Jaegers, controlled by the skills of human controllers. <br/><br/>The human team dedicated to fighting these destructive creatures are based in Hong Kong. The soldiers were all hot-headed and macho heroic types, led by Stacker (Idris Elba). The scientists were portrayed as nerdy and caricature-ish comic relief, led by Dr. Newton (Charlie Day). <br/><br/>The central character is Raleigh Becket, who previously retired from the Jaegers when his brother and partner died in battle. He was portrayed by Charlie Hunnam, who was not too familiar to me, just another generic blonde Hollywood hunk. The face could have been interchangeable with any of the other Caucasian fighters in there. <br/><br/>The lead female character is Mako Mori, an aspiring Jaeger fighter, with a painful past. She is portrayed by Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, who we should remember was nominated for Best Supporting Actress back in 2006 for her role in ""Babel"". Here, she appeared to be confused on how to properly portray her role, so she did not come across too strongly as her character should have been<br/><br/>Despite these casting and characterization flaws though, the movie as a whole still turned out very well. Director Guillermo del Toro faced such a challenge to execute a script that dangerously flirted with disaster, deriving obvious comparisons with, not only ""Transformers,"" but also ""Godzilla"", ""Real Steel"", ""Armageddon"". He succeeded to create within this borrowed material enough heart to make audiences root for the good guys and care if they save the day or not. <br/><br/>When I was watching as the movie went along, it did matter too much anymore that the acting was not too good, or that the scenes looked familiar, or that the lines get corny. The movie was actually engrossing and entertaining. The special effects were of epic proportions. The whole thing worked as a whole, and that is what matters in the end."

","It seems that ratings for movies have gone berserk. With action and sci-fi films I check the rating and in case these are too low I do not bother to watch it. With a 7+ rating I expected that Pacific Rim would at least be above mediocre. The acting is at time appalling. The characters are stereotype and most of them are just obnoxious. A story-line is practically non-existing. It seems that an era has begun were special effects get better rating then acting or plots. Pacific Rim is similar to Battleship, lots of action and more action but absolutely no BRAINS at all.<br/><br/>It is very hard to believe that the man behind ""El laberinto del fauno"" has made such an imbecile movie."

","I have always enjoy Mecha animes growing up, so obviously I am a little biased. But anyways...<br/><br/>What really sets this apart for me is the human factor. When you put a human as a pilot of a colossal machine, you add their emotion and feelings into it. We can connect and feel more for characters that look like us, sad as that may seem. So even if the characters are little basic, we still know how much is at stake and what they are feeling. Although, I do wish they would have explored Raleigh's personal struggles more, because I mean, he watched his brother die while he was still connected to him. I'm pretty sure that would mess up someone quite a bit. I also wish that Gypsy Danger was more of a last resort for him, with him being hesitant to get back in it. But anyways, I digress. What I'm trying to say is, although the characters don't have much depth, the movie still plays well.<br/><br/>And while it is big and loud, it is still infinitely better than the atrocity that is Transformers. By making the Jaegers and Kaiju have less moving parts, you can actually tell what is going on in the fight scenes. Lots of action, very good soundtrack. And even a little comedy with Charlie Day.<br/><br/>Even though it was very predictable, I still enjoyed it very much. I would highly recommend it."

Robots fights with giant monsters anime stories were mainly written for 5- 13 year old child's and they were pretty successful . <br/><br/>I guess the target public for this movie is the same, as beside the actual fights the story line is flat , disappointing, with a lot of clichés and seems to be written for this age interval. Why ? <br/><br/>You invest so much in special effects (fights are really good – the only thing I could enjoy) but so less in story scripts , and actors? <br/><br/>Why bother to do amazing special effects (robots/monsters designs and fights) and rap them around with such stupid story? Aliens coming to colonize our planet through a portal. OK good ! They send clone giant monsters to destroy dominant habitant, and you defend with giant robots . Good so far, but why in the world is needed for the robots to be driven by 2 pilots – no sense at all? <br/><br/>How in the world you can really convince the entire world to build a wall as it is better than some super giant robots – is the world really retard in this movie ? <br/><br/>Why after so many years of fighting you have only 2 so called scientist studying the monsters and not an army of them (why in 2013 you need them fighting between them in theories – cliché )<br/><br/>How in the hell you can get pregnant a giant cloned monster? (Why you use ""the cocky guy staying with the back to the baby monster after throwing a knife and getting eaten after"" cliché? )<br/><br/>How did the pilots returned through portal without having monster DNA ?<br/><br/>How can you get a super strong monster with real natural armor to get cut in half with sword .Yes the effect is amazing but put some physics in the equation , do some minor experiments (through a chicken into a knife and see how much speed or force is needed for it to be cut in 2 ). And it was longitudinal please  <br/><br/>How can you really get exploded a super extra mega atomic bomb without having the damaged robot even move  and in this way there are many inconsistencies which I really did not appreciated for a 2013 mega production. <br/><br/>Effect of the fights are really great but all other not. <br/><br/>I really advice for the producer to have a real critic person working with him to have a before releasing feedback to improve the movie itself. <br/><br/>I was really served with a sandwich of great and really bad, I was ""UUU"" great fights and effects , and soon after I was ""WTF"" , is this real ?"

","Big spectacular looking robots? Check. Even bigger generically designed alien Godzilla-lookalikes? Check. Fantastic special effects? Check. Predictable romance? Check. Traumatized hero sent into self-imposed exile? Check. Glorification of American global power? Check. Militarism again being the answer to a world crisis? Check. Cringe-worthy dialogue? Check. This list could go on and on and reflect my slight disappointment with this movie. Despite being disappointed i must say I did enjoy the designs of the robots and the sense of their gigantic scale. Especially in the beginning of the movie, when their appearance still feels fresh. The fighting between the robots and aliens is also well done. It's a sight to behold to see how well the animators succeeded in making the fights between these giants seem realistic somehow. <br/><br/>The big problem with Pacific Rim to me is that the plot, character progression and dialogue are so dull and worn out by continuous use through decades of action-movies that they started to annoy me more and more as the movie progressed. I could follow other reviewers and celebrate Pacific Rim's 'campness' but to me this predictability seemed more like laziness and a sense of complacency by the director. Imagine him like this; sitting in his director chair, lurking on a cigar, watching the work of his special effects crew, thinking out loud: 'Damn these guys are doing great work! My movie is going to AMAZE people! I don't even have to make an effort to create an interesting storyline and dialogue! ALL HAIL TO CG!'<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, i can enjoy a cheesy plot now and then but in here the unoriginality is so blatant it hurts. The consequence of this predictability is that it makes Pacific Rim 'lack a soul', as in a memorable humanity behind the awesome robot-designs. It would have helped if the acting wouldn't have been so wooden at times. The protagonist Raleigh is just a generic looking dude with no memorable traits at all. Even more stupid is that his rival looks quite a bit like him so that during one action scene I actually was CONFUSED which of the two guys was actually fighting. At least give one the guys a beard so that they differ from each other! It's sad that the role of the antagonist is dwarfed under the weight of the mankind/alien conflict because he has a distinctive strong appearance and could have spiced things up a bit. Another annoying highlight was the 'peeping hole-scene' and almost every other scene between the hero and his Japanese love interest, who, apart from admittingly looking beautiful, acts like a 10-year old girl experiencing her first lovecrush. And the hero? He stays cool offcourse, like a hero does, while the woman almost drips liquid from pure confused excitement. Oh please.<br/><br/>The lack of soul can also be found in the design and character of the aliens. Sure they are big and imposing but they reminded me a hell of lot of the monsters in recent videogames like Crysis and Resistance. What makes things worse is that despite having two brains they have the most predictable alien monster-mindset known to cinema-goers: INVADE. DESTROY. MOVE ON TO NEXT PLANET. There is no deeper psychological layer here. These beasts merely serve as apocalyptic canon fodder to mankind. I actually felt sorry for them when they got blown up at the end, just like I felt sorry for Godzilla in 1998 when he got killed. I wish directors would learn more from a movie like District 9 who shows that it can pay off if you try something new with the depiction of alien enemies. <br/><br/>Things i will remember from this movie in some years? Hongkong being destroyed by a badass he-robot and an evil beast! That was awesome. With the city as a crumbling backdrop the scale and power of the robots/monsters truly shines through. This is Godzilla on American steroids anno 2013, which is cool if you monster movies like me. When the memory of the action subsides the boring look of the militarybase where 80% of the movie happens might come back to my mind. Yellow. Brown... Boring dialogue.

While a cool concept and story, I thought the script was incredibly derivative and saw everything and every cliché coming a mile away. To me, the films biggest sins though are: THE MONSTERS – I thought the designs were bland, unimaginative, uninteresting and unmemorable. Can't remember what they looked like after I left the theater. THE ACTION – Every piece of action in this movie was shot and edited horribly! Horrendous stuffUnforgivable! More weasel on acid cam, more editing by a meth addict on speed, everything I have come to expect, hate and dread in the movies of the last 10 years. To spend most of your budget on special effects and not let your audience get a good look at things is wasteful and frustrating! You could have shot robot puppets on strings, whip panned all over the place and cut it like a coke fiend and saved 99 million bucks!

I can't express how poorly the script, acting, directing and performance was. It was on the level of some action cartoon like pokemon or thundercats. GI Joe was a far better in every aspect. <br/><br/>6: Instead of the world treating this as the apocalypse, just guessing since ""monsters from the sea"" are destroying cities and killing thousands and thousands...and it is just getting worse.

Anyway, I was not amazed and I hoped the movie comes to an end after about 1:45, but the finale was just what had to come. The final sequences were something in between Gandalf and Innerspace. At least I did not fall asleep while watching the movie, but I was not very amused. --- While I understand the requirements for a review, I think it is too strict, because some movies don't justify writing a set of ten lines about it. So this review should maybe be seen as a notice to the moderator and a thought about the reviewing rules on this website. Anyway, I regard IMDb as one of the best resources regarding movies, and I want to thank the staff of IMDb for the effort they put in maintaining this site. Keep up the good work, you are doing a fantastic job!<br/><br/>Fritz Pinguin"

","Went in to the viewing with overall low expectations, and movie didn't disappoint me! Expected great CGI with mediocre story and acting, and got exactly that. As great visuals demand more than a 51"" screen with built-in speakers to carry through on it's own, though, uninvolving acting and predictable plot just dragged overall viewing experience all down. My recommendation is therefore to watch ""Pacific Rim"" in the movie theater where the audio-visuals comes to their rights, and leaves you with the final impression. <br/><br/>In any case: Leave your brains in the wardrobe... <br/><br/>Del Toro had full control on both writing and directing ""El laberinto del fauno""(Pans Labyrinth), and made a masterpiece. Hopefully upcoming ""Pinocchio"" will pay tribute to his ability to make art when both writing and directing. Till then, ""Iron Man"" ticks all the right boxes, and leaves this rip-off in (and together with) Oblivion. <br/><br/>CGI= 7 Contence= 2 Viewing experience on home TV= 3 Overall= 4"

","After all the hype it was a complete let down. It was a mash of all the manned-robot movies or games that you have ever seen. The monsters were boring (thankfully they didn't really feature that much) and the robots were just robots. The plot tried to explain the reason for the monsters appearance: totally unimaginative.<br/><br/>It was CGI in the extreme. The robots were bigger and more powerful, the backgrounds were unrealistic. Everything was so overdone and unreal.<br/><br/>The story line was positively infantile. Before quarter way through I felt sorry for the actors who were trying so hard to overcome this pathetic script. I don't know why I watched to the end. Maybe I thought there had to be something more to the plot. Mistake.<br/><br/>Bigger doesn't mean better and this movie proves it. The three points awarded are for those suffering actors."

","All stories create problems, let them develop and solve it finally. This particular movie, however, creates problems ONLY because it needs to show off. I totally understand the plot should serve the need of developing the characters, but I just couldn't withhold myself easily come up with 1000 ideas of solving the problem that seemed so difficult for our heroes. Also, the actors were emotionally detached so completely that I doubt sometimes if the script was read out but someone else -- maybe the reason is those people didn't buy their own story.<br/><br/>We need an example of why the story, as declared to be a sci-fi one, is unconvincing. <br/><br/>According to the setting, the technical development is so high that neural signals could be fused at conscious level, but a robot needs you to sit in to control it, which is the crucial issue of the whole plot -- had the scientific director heard of remotely controlled drones (belonging to our own age, if you read ABC/NYT/BBC etc.)? <br/><br/>OK, if people think a manned cockpit is cool, why, on earth, need the pilots run on a treadmill to drive it?! Does anyone drive a car by cycling or sail a boat by twisting feet? It is indeed a detail, but the treadmill is really ridiculing -- why they don't use a watermill to drive the robot ? ..."

","Its difficult to find anything to say about this movie. Its stupid,loud, brash and shiny but there isn't a single thought in the entire running time.<br/><br/>Some of the CGI is decent enough, but its overdone. The entire thing is overwrought and the thinking behind Earth's defences and the actions of the pilots is far too ridiculously stupid to believe.<br/><br/>Idris Elba is the only one on screen who makes any attempt to bring some energy to his portrayal, everyone else acts like they've already cashed the cheque.<br/><br/>There are plot holes bigger than the Pacific Rim itself, which would not have taken much to improve upon.<br/><br/>Del Toro doesn't care about characters or story, so he gives us a series of clichés with poor actors like Charlie Hunnam.

So OK,never mind stupid aliens and their extremely stupid plan,now what do we do to defend ourselves? hm... only logical solution - it's better that we instead of just nuke them,or at least tomahawk them with countless number of airplanes,submarines,and aircraft carriers we presently have,way better idea is to build big robots,who,by the way can not be controlled by 1 person(I mean,why would they be,it would be too simple and logical),so the 2 fockers,erm...pilots,running like hamsters inside big robot head just to make him move??? I mean...come on guys... neuro synapses mind merging and then running like hamsters to make robot what walk? And the best thing is the end. OK,they need to seal the rift,with nuclear explosion(are all Hollywood movies insult for intelligence?),so what they do,once again,instead of just sending or deploying missile from submarine,and finish the job in the first place,no they send robots to seal the rift with their nuclear reactor?

I mean, I was previously informed Pacific Rim was original, and I was like: whaaat?<br/><br/>Granted I don't believe this movie was made to be original. It was simply, and boy was it simple, made to dazzle with great visuals and giant robots vs. giant aliens. Literally, there is nothing else of substance to this movie. The acting was subpar, the dialogue atrocious and the comedic touches werewell, never funny. Hell, I even love Charlie Day from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but he was so hard to watch here.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there were a few clever ideas here and the visuals and special effects were literally, huh, out of this world, but I don't see or appreciate movies that are based on one single attribute. And with such lush FX and CGI – which I normally don't like, but here was great thanks to one of the best and creative directors, Guillermo del Toro, the movie did carry me and was incredibly better than some of the movies it stole from, such as Battleship or any of the Transformers disasters.<br/><br/>Here's where I usually give the synopsis, and believe me, I'll be as brief as they were, despite the over two hour runtime: Since aliens coming from outer space is sooo passé, these aliens decided to come up from the ocean and they're huge. Seeing that they're virtually indestructible with our current weapons, Earthlings decide to build Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots of equal size. While forced, emotionless drama and little to mostly meaningless background takes some of the screen time, the bulk of the film is fights between the good guy/bad guy giants.<br/><br/>If I were a kid, damn I probably would've loved this; I craved Godzilla, and the like, big monster movies. Back then, I didn't care so much about drama, originality or depth, but as I got older and have seen thousands of different movies than I had as a child (see above for an incredibly short, albeit relevant taste,) I grew tired of the same ole stuff. It's not like I lost in touch with my younger self, but children need a lot less to impress them than educated adults.<br/><br/>And after this, plus the major disappointments with Battleship, Avatar and even 1998's Godzilla, I still have faith 2014's Godzilla won't let me down. I believe it will fulfill my childhood desires, but also have some depth, real characters and more than a hint of a story. Is that too much to ask when a director is given nearly $200 million dollars that he spends more than $200 dollars on the script?<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: In my first paragraph, I picked some of the most relevant movies that I've seen that I believe this mimicked or flat-out stole from.

This way their performance must be more accurate and stable. Well I guess someone may say but that way they cannot feel the danger and may give up easily because they don't need to save their own life.<br/><br/>The whole movie is a huge mistake, waste of time and money or whatever you call it. I didn't watch the entire movie because it's a template like many thousands of others. I just did a sampling every 10 or 15 minutes and finished the whole movie in less than 10 minutes and I'm sure nothing was missed.<br/><br/>I'm really happy because I saved 2 hours of my time.

","This movie needs only few words to describe it: Tacky Hollywood cliché humor, over the top presentation, awesome visuals and at its core a pure understanding of the genre and a masterful delivery of said concept. It's all a Godzilla/Gundam fan would want to see while at the same time delivering a mainstream appeal to ease the publishers mind that spent a ton of money on making it. The criticism I've read on this movie is understandable and mostly true. Yet if you get thrown such a tasty bone among so many heaps of tasteless treats that Hollywood is known for, it's arrogant to put down something so long overdue and so well done simply because it is prone to Hollywood's usual machinations. If your heart can beat for the genre that this movie stands for, you will love it wholeheartedly. If you're simply intrigued and/or not necessarily a fan of the genre, you might get distracted by some of the, in my opinion minor, faults, which mostly damper a serious tone of the story line that is nevertheless achieved most of the time. It's too good not to enjoy and that's precisely the reason some people will actively look for faults they can trip over. Watch it and make up your own mind is all I can say."

","I have never commented on IDMB, but I feel obliged to warn everyone about this movie, Pacific Rims. Even though I watched this movie mostly because of the CG, it was very difficult to maintain focus since the robots only fight intermittently and you have to put up with the kind of acting these actors pull - cheesy lines throughout the whole film as well as below-average acting especially by the Japanese girl with terrible English. There is some storyline to this film, which makes things even more difficult for viewers to relate to the characters because it tries too hard to bring out empathy. This movie is comparable to Transformers 3, but much worse. I'd rather watch Transformers since it doesn't try to force you to feel for the characters and it also has better CG.

There's no story, and the robot vs monster stuff gets old after the first 10 minutes. <br/><br/>One time when I looked up from my laptop, there was a scene that reminded me so much of a Godzilla movie I saw as a kid, I knew I had to turn it off. I thought this type of drivel was a waste of my time even when I was 12. This is the kind of movie that gave science fiction a bad name in the 60's. Please don't bring that garbage back!

"DKosty123","2","7","15","21 July 2013"," Where's My Darned Movie?
","This movie has the honor of being my first IMAX 3D exposure to any movie. I have to admit that the effects, the 3D, and the surround sound is impressive. As for the movie, the plot has pretty much been done in 100's of films already. Aliens spoiling for taking over Earth (obviously they have not read any of our news about how we have wrecked the planet with climate change) have opened a portal into our planet to develop and plant monster after monster on our planet with plans to attack and destroy us. They want Earth and they want it bad. Sci-Fi fanatics plot to be sure.<br/><br/>The best feature of this movie is that it is short, because it seems to turn into one attack after another after the first 15 minutes of the film. In fact, the scenes with people fleeing the attacks in Hong Kong reminded me very much of a 1950's Godzilla movie. Even the alien monsters look a lot like good old Godzilla, and in the case of the pregnant one, the bride of Godzilla.<br/><br/>The humor is the only relief in this exercise, but there is not enough there to make it entertaining. The script is short and I feel sorry for the cast trying to bring over this turkey. Still, there are some great CGI effects so I guess everything is not lost.<br/><br/>As for me, the most interesting moment is in the previews. It appears Warner Brothers is updating a great movie into the 3D Imax Surround Format that ought to really be something to see. They showed a new trailer for the 75 year old film which pretty much concentrated on special effects of the film, which after watching this one is 75 years ahead of it's time. <br/><br/>Whoever at Warner had the idea of doing the old movie ought to be congratulated because I'd like to see it in IMax not just for special effects but to hear one of the great movie musical sound tracks in surround sound. That preview was for the 1939 Classic Wizard of Oz. <br/><br/>As for Pacific Rim, it appears the San Andreas Fault is not in Kansas yet, Dorothy. If this movie was 3 hours long (ugh) there would be no place like home."
"tradewinds68","9","7","15","20 July 2013"," Pacific Rim Packs a Punch
","***DEFINITE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Although Pacific Rim has had mixed reactions from the critics and box office alike, it is clear to me on a lot of levels that very often, so- called critics only like art-house flicks and don't like to give positive reviews to mainstream movies, even of the caliber of Pacific Rim – it makes them look less intelligent, at least I'm sure that's what they think. <br/><br/>I had mixed feelings about going to see the movie, and I can be just as critical as the critics, but I found very little to criticise either with the movie, special effects or the acting. It had a great plot, and the premise of the shared minds to harness the power of the Jaeger weaponry was a good concept and drove the storyline in a different direction to what might have been another alien shoot-em up movie. A few twists and turns here and there added to the enjoyment of the movie, along with subtle and non-so-subtle humour from the slightly mad scientists and Ron Perlman, whose appearance was an added bonus. <br/><br/>Character-wise, I wasn't sure what to expect after seeing Charlie Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy, I couldn't quite visualise what he would be like as a hero. I was incredibly surprised and happy to find that I really enjoyed his performance as Raleigh Becket. The plot had several twists and turns in it and the special effects were amazingly seamless. Idris Elba portrayed his character very powerfully, his role softened slightly by his father-like relationship with rookie Jaeger pilot, Mako, played by Rinko Kikuchi, who is not generally known for mainstream movies. <br/><br/>I give it a 9/10 and recommend ignoring the critics if you enjoy a rip- roaring humans vs aliens movie with a good plot, solid acting and great SFX (not to mention non-stop action)."
"ViktorDrake","9","7","15","17 July 2013"," Fantastic good fun!
","Simply put - I loved every minute of it! I have a wide appreciation for all genres of movie, and what I love more than anything is a movie that does exactly what it says on the tin.... and this movies does that in spades!<br/><br/>I recently read a review from someone who gave Pacific Rim 1 out of 10, and said something along the lines of, ""I like mature films, so this is terrible"". Yes, well, one look at the trailer should've been more than sufficient to let that particular reviewer know what they were going to see. Yes it's loud. Yes it's big, brash and at times a little brainless, and has more that it's fair share of clichés (although I prefer to call them homages!) but that's what this kind of movie is all about.<br/><br/>That said, I would say there is a little more brain and emotion in this movie than in other films of this type, and all the better it is too as a result. Sure there are plenty of elements from other movies all present and correct. There's a bit of Independence Day, a bit of Transformers, and bit of Top Gun, a bit of the Matrix, even a bit of Inception, but frankly who cares? This movie has NEVER set out to be anything more than it is - a full on crazy action movie about huge mechanical exoskeletons fighting huge alien monsters. Not every movie needs multiple layers of complexity to be considered as good.<br/><br/>The CGI and practical effects are some of the best I've ever seen in any movie, the casting is absolutely fine in my opinion, and the script is perfectly adequate for this type of film.<br/><br/>It's very easy to pick holes in movies like this, such as saying, ""why don't they just fire missiles at the Kaiju instead of fighting them hand to hand"", etc, but that would kind of defeat the whole purpose of the film, and at the end of the day, going to the movies is all about suspending disbelief for a couple of hours of your life. I think too many people have forgotten how to simply enjoy a film at face value without feeling the need to criticise something.<br/><br/>That said, the only thing I felt that was slightly incongruous was the comedic scientist duo. I did find them quite amusing, but when they appeared for a scene they just didn't seem to sit all that well with the incredible action sequences involving the Jaeger's and Kaiju. But that's the only slight negative point I can think of. (One star off for this point).<br/><br/>If this movie had been made when I was 15 it'd instantly be my favourite film of all time. As it is, and with me with an extra 20+ years on my age, it still ranks as a truly great film OF IT'S KIND, in my book. Of course it's not the Godfather, it's not Citizen Kane, it's not Schindler's List, but what it IS is a master class in how to do the ""big boys toys"" action genre.<br/><br/>See it in IMAX (as I did) and simply revel in the rib-rumbling noise and eye-popping action. For what it is, it's very VERY hard to beat."

","This is a B movie with a massive CGI budget.<br/><br/>The characters are 2 dimensional and the plot is predictable. I kept myself amused spotting the plot holes and inconsistencies. How come you need a monster to use the lift of the way down, but not on the way back? A giant robot falling from a few thousand feet could possibly survive, the people inside - no. Heavily reinforced metal body armour might help you survive in a robot/monster battle, but will drown you the moment you try and swim in it. The robot pilots move their legs at one speed, the robot legs move at another, although the arms were more closely synchronised. I could go on. And on. And on.<br/><br/>The action sequences are over the top and very repetitive and the dialogue is embarrassingly gung-ho.<br/><br/>I really went wanting to enjoy this. I am also a huge fan of Idris Elba. I hope they paid him a lot for his time. Me, I wasted 131 minutes of my life.<br/><br/>Bring back the chap in the rubber Godzilla suit."

But that is literally the only good thing about this movie, except for maybe Charlie Day, who I felt played his role well. He was way more serious than his normal role of Charlie from It's Always Sunny, and I totally bought it.<br/><br/>The script is pure trash, Hollywood exec's continue to lower the bar for what can be turned into a movie. There were almost as many one-liners as in the latest Die Hard movie. In fact, there was one scene were someone tied 3 one-liners together! Besides the script being bad, there were too many illogical scenes throughout the movie. There's several fighting scenes where the robot picks up the alien and just tosses him into buildings when he could just shoot it with either the chest cannon thing, the plasma beam on its left arm, or stab it with the sword that appears from nowhere on it's right arm! These pointless scenes do nothing but pointlessly extend the movie time. Yes I was redundant there on purpose.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, when the two escape pods surface on the ocean and the helicopters are coming to rescue them, there are like 20 helicopters flying in V for Victory formation and they do a flyover the 2 stranded pilots! None of the helicopters slow down or stop to rescue them! <br/><br/>I don't know if it's quite fair to say that the acting was bad in this movie, they don't really get to choose their lines! But I doubt any actors could've pulled any Oscar from this script, I swear an eighth grade boy wrote it and a tenth grade girl edited it."

This is worst than the last Indy movie. <br/><br/>It tries to be a Japanese film but is nowhere near the standard, it's embarrassing.

Why does there always have to be a love story? It ruins the great storyline you could have had and replace it by a love story we see in every movie and does not provide any added value. It just makes you feel uncomfortable and exposes their terrible acting skills. It is just an easy way to fill half an hour of the movie with easy mindless dialogue instead of focusing on the real story. You know the commander does not want to put them together, but he will. You know the commander will give a big speech. You know there will be a dog. Can it be any lamer? The acting was bad, the storyline abandoned, the dialogues just terrible. The 2 scientists were a bad joke, remember when he puked in the toilet or they gave that handshake. They could have made a great movie with a great story, giant monsters and big robots. They decided to go the cliché way. This was just as terrible as Battleship and was actually a TV- disaster movie. And then you come here and see this movie gets high points. Don't you guys have any shame or expectations? How can you give this a high score. It was objectively a terrible movie. It is just the same as with iron man and superman. Lets end with a too long action scene. A 30 minutes action scene is quite boring actually. I rather have a good story. And why the hell do the robots draw their sword not sooner? And why does the scientist not just use a phone to warn them the plan of dumping the bomb in the rim wont work? So disappointed in nowadays action hero movies and public.

This movie is designed from the outset for the 8 year olds. The plot is superficial and kept to the minimum - giant robots battles giant monsters, and that's pretty much it, even though it is pretty illogical and doesn't take a 9 year olds to see why you would need giant robots at all to battle these monsters - it would be far more economical to just build 1000 cannons that fires exactly the same type of projectiles the giant robots used to defeat the monsters.<br/><br/>The acting was also pretty cringe worthy, truly some spectacular C-grade stuff, with Max Martini and Robert and Kazinsky pretending to be Australians with their laughable faux Australian accent. Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi were decent, but the plot made their efforts seem cartoonish, while Idris Elba's acting was just down right corny; with Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as sideshows to round out the cast. Cartoonish acting aside, this movie continues the same disturbing Hollywood tradition of racial stereotypes - the Chinese and the Russians were dispensable and dispatched quickly early in the movie, while ""the token black guy"" Idris Elba (the ONLY black guy in the movie) was also dispensable and died in the movie.<br/><br/>There is also a very clear plagiarism happening throughout the movie - ""aliens"" attacked the earth, humanity is on the verge of extinction, nerdy scientist got in alien's brain and figured out how to defeat them, and the movie ends with the good guy (and a gal) ""took out the little master aliens with the nuke"".... sounds familiar? You would mistaken this for Independence Day (1996).<br/><br/>Over all, it is as entertaining as watching WWE on TV. You would enjoy it if you are an 8 year old or a redneck (or both!). 3/10"
"TheSquiss","3","8","18","23 July 2013"," Cross Transformers with Godzilla, dilute, torpedo and, voilà, Pacific Rim!
","My first reaction after viewing the trailer for Pacific Rim was: What the hell is Guillermo del Toro, the master behind Pan's Labyrinth, doing? My hope upon emerging from the screening is that he is laughing at us while counting his huge pile of money. The alternative, that he is actually proud of this mess, is a little depressing.<br/><br/>No, Pacific Rim doesn't plummet the depths of the torpedoed hulks of Battleship but it doesn't belong on the CV of such a director. Take Transformers, (yes, that Michael Bay, um, epic) cross it with Godzilla (the Roland Emmerich offering – please, god, let Gareth Edwards make it all better with his Godzilla next year), take it down a notch and you'll find Pacific Rim close by.<br/><br/>Sometime in the future, Earth has been attacked, not from space as we all expected, but from the depths. A fissure has opened and great big nasty creatures, known as kaiju, are emerging at regular intervals, trashing cities, killing humans and generally being a bit of a nuisance. Rather than call in the best munitions experts to develop weaponry that will penetrate the kaiju and then explode, somebody somewhere decided it would be better to spend countless billions on building huge transformers, sorry, jaegers, that can engage in hand-to-hand (with some gadgetry) combat, trash cities, kill humans and generally be a nuisance. That's where the sense of Pacific Rim goes AWOL.<br/><br/>When the jaegers fail, washed-up pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) returns to the military fold to help save the day under the guidance of Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) and watched by trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kiluchi).<br/><br/>Like Battleship, the acting warrants no comment other than to say it's adequate and suits the film. Make of that what you will.<br/><br/>If you do pay your hard earned cash to watch Pacific Rim, try to block out the dialogue. There is little hope for a movie when the men tapping out the screenplay (Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro) lumber Elba with inspirational speeches that appear to be Braveheart castoffs. Did they really think they could get away with such gems as: <br/><br/>""One: don't you ever touch me again. Two: don't you ever touch me again."" <br/><br/>and<br/><br/>""Today we face the monsters that are at our door, today we are cancelling the apocalypse!"" <br/><br/>Oh boy. Elba may have boosted his profile with Pacific Rim, but his credibility remains with The Wire and Luther. Fortunately, penciled on his CV are some potentially very impressive films with Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom and The Gunman standing out.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is visually so cluttered it's difficult to see what is going on much of the time, although perhaps that's a blessing or even a ploy to maximize enjoyment.

","This film had caught my attention a while back but the premise and the nature of its characters led me to pre-conceived ideas of what this film was going to be.<br/><br/>However its huge budget, big name director and flashy trailer all drew me in, and I'm so glad they did! This does not so much feel like a movie but an event at times. You are witness to a grudge match on the most epic of epic scales. The fighting is intense, the monsters are damn scary and you find yourself feeling empathy for the huge, lumbering, humanoid robots. This is one of those movies you absolutely need to see on a big screen. In my case I went to the Odeon Imax in Greenwich which was perfect. Don't read too much about it, don't watch too many trailers, just go see it. I for one am seeing it again!"

","I won't bother with an actual summary of this film since they managed to pour in every cliché imaginable. You've seen this movie already, just think Transformers meets Godzilla, add some terrible acting to the mix and there you have it. <br/><br/>This movie will seriously go through every lame cliché from the 90s.<br/><br/>Movies like this insult the viewers intelligence, I don't know why this crap doesn't go straight to video, isn't there a committee of any kind that establishes quality?<br/><br/>The rating on IMDb is unbelievably high so I'm guessing they actually went ahead and bought good reviews and ratings. IMDb is slowly but surely becoming untrustworthy because of things like this, it's honestly sad that you can't even rely on them to have a clear depiction of the quality of things."

","The movie has a lot of interesting technology on the screen but it gets boring fast. In between the big fights there is little to keep your interest and even the fights get repetitive. It's like watching wrestling for 2 hours as the plot and character development do little to make the fight scenes mean much other than showing off CGI skills. Example: The acid spitting monster does a take down on the 3 armed samurai robot but wait the samurai robot gets up and does a arm chop to the neck!! No talent to write this movie just take any wrestling match and add a love interest that never seems real and of course the required we can win speech and the standard geek scientist and you have this movie. The 60 year old Godzilla movie is a far better movie as far as giant monsters from the ocean destroying the city go. Pacific Rim will be forgotten in a couple years."
"tornadoofdepressingdeath","5","8","18","12 July 2013"," Hit or miss—depending on your tastes
","So. Pacific Rim. <br/><br/>In all honesty, how much you like the movie depends almost entirely on what you're expecting and what you like in movies.<br/><br/>If you're watching the movie for mecha vs. monster action, then you will not be disappointed. The kaiju designs are wonderful, and at times wonderfully creepy, and the special effects make everything shine. There are plenty of battles and action, and mecha fans will be amused by homages to various mechas in media, even if non-mecha fans find those homages over- the-top. The movie takes a fair amount of time for world-building, which will appease action- seekers who are new to mechas. The action sequences will definitely have everyone on the edges of their seats; it's hard to dislike the movie on the basis of its action.<br/><br/>However, it's very easy to dislike the movie in other ways. The characters are almost all painfully two-dimensional, and there's not much development to speak of. (Some characters are lucky enough to have some, but most go without, or with very weak development.) In fact, basically nothing here is character-driven. Characters interact, but you only glean the most basic of facts about them from their conversations. By the end of the movie, you know a bare handful of facts about each character, and with one or two exceptions, it's hard to see the characters as real, complex people. I don't remember most of the characters' names, and I'll only remember the characters themselves because of the actors playing them. The writing isn't much more impressive. Much of the dialogue is clunky and repetitive, and the movie itself is extremely predictable at times. (Arguably, the predictability is due to homages to mecha and kaiju films/series.) Also, there is an astounding lack of diversity in the cast. Of the named characters, only two are women, and of the named characters with substantial speaking parts, all are white except for Elba and Kikuchi, even though most of the movie is set in Hong Kong. <br/><br/>Personally, I prefer my movies to be character-driven, so I was unimpressed with this film— and thus the rating. But, as I said, whether you love or hate the movie has to do with your personal tastes. Are you a mecha fan who loves action scenes? Then you'll probably adore this movie. But if you, like me, prefer complex characters who interact with each other in ways that aren't driven by plot, you'll probably want to pass on this one."

","Too many plot holes. Too much talking. Too long. Difficult to see action sequences. Too many action movie clichés. I went to this movie with a bunch of friends and we all disliked it. While I have never walked out on a film I was very tempted to walk out of this one.<br/><br/>The worst part though was the flat interaction between most of the main characters. The two biggest offenders are Burn Gorman and Charlie Day who are inane as the squabbling experts. Even the introduction of Ron Perlman fails to ignite the screen as he phones in his part.<br/><br/>The only saving grace was Idris Elba, who plays the role of the Marshall with the same intensity as his TV character Luther."

However, they decided to break one of the cardinal rules of science fiction writing, which is ""be consistent."" To the extent that one can figure out the plot, there are huge problems with what is happening and why. The weapons and abilities of the robots and monsters seem to change based on the whim of the CGI animator. You have to wonder if anybody saw the entire movie script or plot line before the movie was complete.<br/><br/>Finally, there are the pointless back story and side stories. When you're group is the only hope of stopping the end of the world, I'm pretty sure that nobody is going to put up with people who waste time on political infighting and alpha male dominance."

"andrarizvia","7","10","24","11 July 2013"," Just the Way I Expected... More or Less
","First of all, i've gotta say that when you go to watch a movie, you must have some sort of expectation about the movie that you're gonna watch. It's the thing that you expect, that you hope'll happened in that movie. <br/><br/>I'll tell you what my expectation about this Pacific Rim movie. I expect that this movie will give me some sort of new view (since i'm a big fat fan of scifi, giant robots, and monsters) and combination of a post apocalyptic movie and monster attack. I expect a more advance CGI and special effect from the robots (it's called Jaeger) and all of the fight scenes with the monsters (it's called Kaiju), at least above transformers level, but on a bigger scale. And most important of all, i want some logical explanation of whatever happens, not just some nonsense that they threw away and patch it away with some cool graphics whatsoever (like in the 2012 movie). About the actors, now my expectation is towards the opposite direction, cause i don't intend to see some of great acting out of some (giant)monster vs(giant) robot movie, just a decent one is enough. Now if you go to see Pacific Rim in my set of expectation, you'll get what you want... well, more or less. <br/><br/>Let's get to the downside first. The acting of almost all of the important cast were standard (some are below standard though). No special characteristic that will make them be remembered as all of them are replaceable (Except RonPerlman's unique appearance, though I don't really know his function in the first place). The plot graphics fluctuates up and down as the movie running as some scenes are making you sleepy, but another makes you unbelievably psyched (hint: the fisticuffs side). <br/><br/>Talk about plot holes, at the beginning of the movie the logics are lined up pretty well. By the time the movie reached half time the plot holes seems to appear pretty often, though more or so its still edible. <br/><br/>All of that thing aside, what makes Pacific Rim a great movie is the main reason that you watch it in the first place. Yes! Its the monsters and the robots. I gotta give a credit to Guilermo Del Toro, thus he's brave enough and willing to make this movie in the first place. To count that there's not that many movie with giant monster theme or giant robot theme (except maybe from Japan, which many of us are unfamiliar with), but to combine it into one clash is one of the most brilliant and brave idea ever come in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Kaiju designs are of course not childish (comparing to Godzilla movies from Japan), as it is more chilling and frightening, since Del Toro's experience in making ""monsters""is beyond perfection. Also the destruction caused by the monsters are illustrated nicely, as we are shown how the earth, cities, and its people are transformed, years after the attack. As for the Jaeger, they have a very excellent design, with various forms, and human pilots (remind us of the mobile suit in Gundam series, or the robot in the movie Robot Jox in the late 80's), a very unique concept which make a good response for the Kaiju attack in an intense, life risking fight. <br/><br/>For conclusion, If you unsure whether to watch Pacific Rim of not, just remember that what you seek in this movie is not some sort of amazing Oscar acting, but rather a stress release movie about a post apocalyptic monster attack world, with cool giant robots battle. Maybe you'll love it for the most part if you're a fan-boy. <br/><br/>Objectively... 6.5 stars out of 10."

","There lies our inner child who will squeal when giant mecha heroically arrives to fend off gargantuan tower size monster in an epic battle that will surely destroy anything around them, but we really don't care about collateral damage. Pacific Rim is a homage to that forgotten child and ultimately the mecha genre. I didn't expect Japanese inspired Godzilla-esque scenes, where it was made from cardboard miniature and people in suit back in the old days, will be realized into hyper stylish modern day action movie. Granted, it's still marred by a few typical disaster movie clichés, but it will make your eyes open wide and mouth agape just seeing the colorful metal knight versus relentless organic behemoth as your childhood is relived once again.<br/><br/>There hasn't been anything quiet like it visually. Color palette is glossy and bright, the motion of the gigantic being, either it's steel or flesh, is appropriately smooth. The scale of the encounters is immense, often showcasing stormy sea and dystopian night life to emphasis the clash. Use of 3D effect highlights it even more, its camera angle shows the threat of Kaiju, the monsters, in a daunting perspective. These walking antagonists deliver thrill light years ahead compared to usual monster type on their television counterparts. It makes the appearance of Jaegar, the robots, even more exciting and the battle that much better. There's just no shortage of colossal mayhem in Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>Story takes a bleak contemporary setting where Kaiju attack gradually increases, however this is unlike gritty nuance of apocalypse, it still has some fun and humor. Humanity's answer for the Kaiju infestation is Jaegars. tall stoic robotic entities which take two persons to pilot by synchronizing their thoughts. With incredibly fast paced screenplay, the movie pulls audience to invest in the story. Charlie Hunnam from Sons of Anarchy fame takes the role of the troubled protagonist Raleigh Becket. He's clean cut with emotional baggage of losing his brother. In a way it makes him a compatible with Mako Mori, played by Rinko Kikuchi, the teen girl from Babel.<br/><br/>The dynamic between them is the majority of the story, which arguable takes a bit longer than expected. They do relatively fine, although there's not much chemistry to be had. Charlie Day and Ron Perlman are present, mostly for comedy relief. It appears that the movie would like to introduce larger-than-life characters, much like those in anime. Some scenes don't really work since it's trapped in predictable cycle, such as some ridiculous death scenes or the speech before final battle.<br/><br/>Credit must go to Guillermo Del Toro for creating a movie he's truly passionate about. Mecha genre is far from mainstream, especially in blockbuster, but it now has a decent representation in the form of Pacific Rim. Some silliness or occasional slow scenes aside, it's a fresh entertaining rendition of boys mecha fantasy and an especially irresistibly captivating action movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Rate 8/10"

"BernardGT","9","6","13","14 July 2013"," Guillermo del Toro's passion on kaiju works as the apocalypse is canceled
","In the typical summer movie season where reboot, remake, sequel and adaptation are easily available and predominantly form the bulk of new releases; the arrival of the lesser form of those or original movie is always something eagerly been looking for. Although Pacific Rim does not entirely fit to be defined as original, but the lack of reference to any established property makes this a distinguished piece of summer blockbuster. But doubts are definite since this genre seldom produces a sell-out blockbuster and brilliant outcome to begin with, while excitements are also running high since Pacific Rim is presented by director Guillermo del Toro whose works mainly deal with smart horror and sci-fi. At the end of this review, we will see whether this movie is a worthy experience movie for every dime you spent or it merely falls into the same pit holes of over-hyped summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>To debate the originality of the concepts presented in Pacific Rim and to mix it among the handful of monster movies is pointless and unnecessary. The credits to be due here are that Pacific Rim is both homage to the classic kaiju films and also serves to revitalize the interest and outlook of this genre to the new generation. Del Toro's affection to monsters is not much a secret nowadays and it is perhaps for those affections that bring in the sole reason of why Pacific Rim will not be a disappointing movie. While most of the other similarly themed movies will opt to go for loud actions with empty shells, del Toro gives more emphasize on the characters building but he does not completely obliterates the need for those big sequences. The fights are loud-yet-beautifully grasped in a cross-path of conventional flow and modern touch of chaotic, erratic behavior. Constantly offered in a long duration of stereoscopic macro-shots, these physical scenes are handled well and more sharply-focused than, let's say the Michael Bay's Transfromers trilogy.<br/><br/>Unlike most of the summer offering that gives only the dumb-yet-fun popcorn flick, Pacific Rim takes audience into the fiery future of dangerous world and enhanced it with great surging interest on both sciences and humanity. The plot, scribed by Travis Beacham and del Toro, is carefully constructed to balance between the emotional journey that connects the pilots through the neural-handshake and the related arc stories that contribute and influence each other. The prologue is a very detailed account that requires deep analysis of how this tragedy affects the daily lives of more than 7 billion people around the world as it works the same way as how World War Z introduces their own problem to the mass. Fortunately, the well-made prologue does not go wasted as the progression of the story quickly ascends into a tale of not only about the mecha-kaiju fight, but also a fight against their demons. The slight wrinkles, though are the cliché and predictable plot all along.<br/><br/>The concept of neural bond, according to del Toro, is the single most important signature of the movie, a point of which I fully agree and largely portrayed. Neural bond offers a glimpse of the relationship and shared-cognitive state that offers more than just a scientific answer. Becket's struggle to overcome the pain of losing his own brother is as remarkable as the memory of Mori's when she was just little girl, lost in streets of Tokyo and experiencing the terrors. It is surprising indeed as the marketing trailers did not highlight this point but the manifest in the end product clearly shows how the character study and development actually form the basis of the story. Hunnam's Becket, Kikuchi's Mori and Elba's Pentecost, in my opinion are the emotional anchors and effectively making these characters something to care for in the end of the day. To be expecting cardboard development or acting on the characters are entirely wrong because one who is familiar with del Toro's works will know that he gives each of his character a throughout and equal package. Then try having this little girl whom I am sure will have a bright future. Her name is Mana Ashida and she plays the young Mori with decorative expression, a moment that really jerks the inner- self to emotion flow.<br/><br/>Along with some cool effects and inspirational designs, the music scores by Ramin Djawadi whose works are prominent in Iron Man, Game of Thrones and Person of Interest is truly phenomenal. My vote goes to Djawadi for the best soundtrack of the year. The effects are amazing, although over- ambitiously crafted but it enhances the whole movie into a larger scale. The challenge for Pacific Rim is to outdo the artistry perfection that rarely presented in the modern and contemporary summer flick, what's more in kaiju movie as such.<br/><br/>In the end, Pacific Rim is an excellent, well-made and beautiful sci-fi action flick that pays homage to the genre with its solid plot that transcends above the norm themes and philosophy with ample development of the characters that we will eventually care for. Guillermo del Toro marries the traditional and modern filmmaking with effective the emotion-driven story, outstandingly focused special effects and epic soundtrack."
"Pherze","8","6","13","11 July 2013"," action,good comic relief and an overall good time
","First off, Del Toro is a visual director,that is fact.In this movie he steps into a level all his own. At face level this movie was a Mech versus monster movie and that's what it is. The underlying stories are not bad,they aren't done as well as they perhaps should have. The underlying story may not come out as effectively as some people may expect but that does not distract from the overall fun factor. This movie has a good level of comic relief especially from Ron Perlmans' character. There are some pretty strong characters too, Idis Elba for example is his usual brilliant self as stacker and Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chow is genuinely funny. Overall this is a very good action film, if you appreciate action, give up an hour and a half or so of your time and you won't be disappointed."

","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>Went to watch aliens and robots beat the crap out of each other, that's exactly what I got. Although the movie was quite serious throughout, Guillermo del Toro does an excellent job of adding bits of humor where appropriate to relieve viewers from the 2 hours of non-stop intense action. I was thinking of giving this movie a 9/10 originally as I originally felt lost in the history of the protagonists, but then thought to myself what was the original purpose of watching this movie.... the action sequences, and they were brilliantly presented. It might take some time to figure things out but you can do that during the calm dialog sequences presented throughout the film. Watched the movie in Imax 3D. There are some films one must watch in theater, and this is one. The love theme is explored in a unique way between the two main protagonists, not in the repetitive sexual way you see in every single damn movie. There is one scene which I don't want to spoil which especially explores the relationship between the two protagonists very well. I recommend this movie to people of all ages, well done Guillermo del Toro, good comeback, I'm looking forward to a sequel, and am quite disappointed the movie did not do that well in the box office.

","Pacific rim is a movie with a lot of problems, but first the good things: The monster design is great. It's very imaginative and impressive. The visual effects are some of the best I've seen. Actors do a fine job. <br/><br/>The problems start with a script devoid of any sense or a good story... or suspense or surprises for that matter. This is a movie that cannot be spoiled because you'll know everything that's gonna happen 10 minutes before it does anyway. I never cared for any of the characters. They break rules all the time, endanger other people, fight among themselves and don't do enough good to counterweight that behavior. <br/><br/>The fight scenes are pretty unimpressive despite the great CGI. They just get boring after a couple hits when you start wondering why don't they just shoot the monsters? In fact, why build giant robots anyway? That's a horrible idea! There's hundreds of better ways to kill those things. Flying plasma cannons. A satellite laser. Anything! Why punch them when you can shoot them? People say it's a homage to cartoons, but it doesn't work as that either. The drama just doesn't work when people are that stupid. Maybe if the characters were interesting or at least likable and a better story I wouldn't care about logic flaws so much. As is they should've made at least some excuses for their stupidity.<br/><br/>Sometimes the sound mixing is pretty bad. I really struggled to hear what characters were saying during fight scenes. The music goes to 11 and the sound of things hitting each other just makes the voices inaudible.<br/><br/>I won't even mention the hundreds of things that didn't make any sense. If this movie was going for serious drama: it failed. If this movie was going for ironic fun: it failed. By the way, the main characters at the end would've died of decompression sickness. So there's that.<br/><br/>A surprisingly bad, joyless and tedious experience."

","I was disappointed in this movie. I am a fan of Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perleman, from Sons of Anarchy mostly, but their acting was lifted too much from that series — Hunnam's stifled, angry look is there in droves. The female lead's acting was unbelievable, as well; in fact, it was really bad, as was almost all the supporting casts except for Idris Elba's. Every summer blockbuster trope was indeed there: the mad, zany scientists; the hero overcoming some past tragedy; the dying leader making the ultimate sacrifice; the grand battle at the end to save the world. Granted, this type of movie is not meant to be deep and thought provoking, but the story and acting have to pull you in, at least somewhat, and it never did for me. The story line was disjointed,too; it felt really forced and hokey. You have to have at least some depth, or all the special effects are just flash (although they were very well done). Another, more personal complaint I had was the film used; it was all digital. Along with the poor acting, the digital ""film"" made it seem like I was watching a made-for-TV movie, albeit one with a big budget. Fortunately, I found a ticket in one of the kiosks so didn't have to pay for my entrance; otherwise, I might have been more upset at wasting my money. Overall, I would grade it a C+. Maybe good for a Red Box or Netflix rental on a lazy Sunday."

I didn't expect it to make any scientific or technological sense, but it was like the producers of a bad Adult Swim anime got handed a billion dollars and given too much freedom. And stretching it to over two hours rather than 90 minutes didn't help. I found the Transformers movies more enjoyable, and I'm not at all a Transformers fan."

Maybe that's the idea, who knows.<br/><br/>Del Toro is a director who has proved he can make hugely imaginative, original, and beautiful works.

"nebk","6","3","5","4 January 2014"," Pacific Sized Disappointment
","Pacific Rim is a visually stunning and utterly forgettable blockbuster. What makes it a disappointment is that it could have been so much better if only time was spent on developing the story and dialog as much as it was on the stunning special effects. I expected it to be so much better given that Guillermo Del Torro co-wrote the script and directed it. <br/><br/>In the near future huge alien creatures known as Kaijus are invading the earth and decimating cities. They arrive through a dimensional rift located at the bottom of the pacific. To combat them, giant robots known as Jagers have been created. These look like a cross between transformers and the robot from the movie when the earth stood still. They are usually operated by two people who are connected through something known as the ""neural handshake"". The Jaeger program is being dismantled for reasons which are not clearly explained. Apparently it's not effective even though it's the only thing that seems to stop the monsters. Instead, the powers that be have decided to build a wall. When the wall is show to be useless, the few remaining Jaegers are grouped in Hong Kong and to try and destroy the gateway which allows Kajius access to Earth. Obviously they will need to re-train the hero to do so. This would be a pilot of the Jaeger, who lost his brother fighting Kajius at the beginning of the movie. He is partnered with a rookie pilot and him and her (although the underdogs) will probably prevail to save the day. Whilst falling in love of course. And that's pretty much it, there are some sub-plots but ultimately these are just a distraction from the main story or lack of it.<br/><br/>The good points: the monsters and robots are really well done. The effects are fantastic. Especially the fight scenes. Charlie Hunnam & Rinko Kikuchi in the lead roles are fine and their chemistry is good on screen. There is some decent acting by the supporting cast as well, especially by Ron Perlman and Clifton Collins Jr. Idris Elba is good as well but he is not given much to work with and has a bland motivational speech to give and at one point says 'today we cancel the apocalypse' which is appropriate since plausibility and the need for a gripping coherent story are canceled as well. <br/><br/>The other bad points: the whole story reminds me of the Voltron Cartoons. Those who remember the cartoon will recall that in the cartoon a giant robot was fighting huge creatures/monsters in space. This is very similar, just set on earth. For those who don't remember the cartoon just imagine transformers fighting Godzilla on steroids. And then fighting Godzila's extended and ever more menacing family. Who are also on steroids. I could look past this if the story wasn't so formulaic and clichéd. The movie suffers from clichéd characters throughout its whole duration. The heroic commander who has a secret to reveal, the troubled hero with baggage, the co-pilot with baggage, the other young Jaeger pilot who is annoying and doesn't like the hero, and two scientist who are polar opposites but manage to work out within a few hours what no one else had been able to in years. Convenient timing that, otherwise the last ditch attack would be for nothing. <br/><br/>Another few things which are not well explained are: why are there only 4-5 Jaegers remaining in the world and why aren't the governments of the world supporting mass production of them? What is a neural handshake exactly? Why does it take two pilots to operate the Jaeger? And how is it then possible for one individual to do so? Why are the Jaegers fighting almost 1-1 with the Kaiju? Why not have a squad of them decimate the creatures? These are just some of the questions that could be asked. And there are many other implausibilities as well. <br/><br/>Overall I still prefer this to the transformer movies but it's nothing special or original. I would give it a 6/10. Worth watching if you want to switch off the brain for a couple of hours, not if you want a plot that makes much sense or is plausible. Such a pity, because it could have been a great action movie if only it had a story that made more sense."
"Doc_Tourneau","4","3","5","15 December 2013"," A big disappointment for this Del Toro fan
","I generally like Guillermo Del Toro's movies, so this one came as a huge disappointment to me. So many things not to like: 1.The Kaiju are WAY overdesigned, with much too much bioluminescence effects – it looks like they've come equipped with running lights. And glow-in-the-dark breath. So they look kind of silly, at least the parts you can make out. 2. Speaking of Kaiju, there's no buildup to any sort of 'reveal' at all. We see them almost immediately (in video footage, no less) the film begins. Even the original ""Gojirah"" filmmakers back in the 1950s knew enough to keep the big 'G' offscreen for a little while, thus heightening audience anticipation. ""Pacific Rim"" blows its wad in the first minute or so. 3. And speaking again of the Kaiju, there's too many of them, they're very much alike in most ways, and their origin is unnecessarily explained (and, perhaps, over-explained). There's no star of this monster show, as it were – just a succession of variations-on-a-theme. 4. A common fault of apocalyptic sci-fi action pictures is that the characters seem to be having too good of a time, considering their circumstances and the stakes involved. Same thing here, with only Idris Elba's 'Marshall Pentecost' character displaying any sort of gravitas. 5. Like their monster counterparts, the giant robot 'Jaegers' are also overdesigned, and of such an enormous scale that it's hard for the viewer to figure out their overall form and capabilities. This is made doubly obfuscated by having most of the battles take place hip-deep in the ocean water, at night, and in the rain.<br/><br/>Despite my problems with the monsters and the robots, the production design on the rest of the show is pretty fantastic. I especially love the rusty, dented, and otherwise bashed-about look of the Jaeger command centers/maintenance depots, which are perfect combination of fantasy tech and down-and-dirty verisimilitude. The depiction of war zone Hong Kong is likewise carried off perfectly.<br/><br/>It's in the Hong Kong-based part of the story that ""Pacific Rim"" could have found it's real heart. The street-level view of a rampaging Kaiju is much more terrifying than the Jaeger-pilot view, or the audience's third-person view from 40 feet above sea level. The civilian perspective of life right behind front lines of the Kaiju war is much more interesting than the Jaeger barracks infighting and personality clashes. Ron Perlman's 'Hannibal Chau' character, trying to get rich quick by selling Kaiju body parts to collectors, is a classic war zone hustler character with roots going all the way back to ""Casablanca"". I would've preferred much more life-during-wartime intrigue, rather than the daddy issues and testosterone-driven competitiveness going on back at the barracks.<br/><br/>The film didn't do all that well at the US box office, and I wonder if Giant Monsters/Giant Robots is simply a trope that simply doesn't resonate as much with American audiences as it does in Japanese pop culture. From Dracula through Hannibal Lecter, we prefer our monsters on a more personal scale (hell, even ""King Kong"" was basically a love story) and in a form we can identify with. Same with the robots – Robby, C-3 PO, Roy Batty, Commander Data. Maybe ""Pacific Rim"" was always the purview of a small coterie of American otaku, but everybody forgot that.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro has long expressed an interest in bringing H.P. Lovecraft to the screen. (His adaptation of ""At the Mountains of Madness"" was beaten into production by the similarly-themed ""Prometheus"".) Somebody at Warner Bros. should have had their thinking cap on; with a little bit of rewriting, ""Pacific Rim"" could have been the greatest Lovecraftian story ever brought to the screen. Now both of Del Toro's dreams are severely crippled – perhaps mortally so. Too bad."
"Gin-ster","8","3","5","9 December 2013"," Utterly ridiculous and lots of fun
","There is a lot about this movie that is beyond ridiculous. As others have stated, you have to wonder, when fighting the monsters, why not use the ultra-weapons in the first place rather than duking it out ""mano a mano"" and then finally pulling out the really powerful weapons, like cannons that blast them to smithereens? And the whole conceit of needing to build giant robots is also ridiculous - why not just go straight to the weapons and deliver them by, say, drone attacks? Let's just say it all starts with suspending disbelief bigtime. But that is not unique to this film, of course; it is a component of all fantasy/sci fi films, so having said that, I will move on to the good points.<br/><br/>Strange to say, while it will not win literary prizes for character development, much less originality, they are strangely affecting and you care what happens to them - a statement I rarely make in connection with big special effects extravaganzas. Idris Elba's charisma and gravitas needs no further comment. And while other characters are ""stock"" action figures, for some inexplicable reason they all ""work"" too. When the heroine and the young pilot face off in a martial arts competition, the young woman's frail appearance makes it look like an unfair matchup yet it fits nicely within the Asian tradition of female martial arts stories like ""Crouching Tiger."" Furthermore as others have noted, there is real chemistry between the two actors. And while I don't want to go overboard on the issue of emotional resonance, the scene in which the heroine (as a child) shrieks and cries amidst devastation caused by the monsters is truly affecting.<br/><br/>As far as science fiction, there are some good sci fi elements; the mind-melding needed to man (or woman) the robots makes for some interesting sci fi as does (SPOILER) the scientists' use of this in attempting to understand the alien attackers. Speaking of which, there is also humor, provided not only by the scientists (who are, however, gross caricatures) but by another caricature played by Ron Perlman of a wheeler-dealer who will sell you anything. Yet despite the humor it doesn't break the overall sense of ""serious threat."" Of course (SPOILER ALERT) the rules of Hollywood were so clearly in effect in this film that I did not bother to ask ""Will the hero survive? Will we (the human race) win against the aliens?"" etc. I knew from the start that it would all end well. But I didn't mind. At times it was a bit too much crash/boom and I was distracted by wondering how many gazillions of dollars the incredible CGI effects must've cost. But overall it was a fun way to spend some time if you leave your critical thinking at the door."

I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The effects work was exceptional. The completely physical cockpits did great service to the film, allowing for much more depth of reaction from the actors. The decision to avoid motion capture for the Jaegers lent a feeling of real weight and ponderous momentum that the fluidity of human movement would have lacked. The sound work was superb, the impacts could be felt through the bass- and the soundtrack was just as good at getting the heart pumping.<br/><br/>I fully intend to have a copy of this film playing in my home at all times.

","Does no one else realize, Pacific Rim was never intended to be a great action movie, never intended to have an original storyline (one of Sr. Del Toro's strengths). It did not require brilliant writing (which Guillermo has blessed us with repeatedly) or even good acting. He was not tipping his hat to anime, or to the old, black and white Godzillas, etc. He was openly thumbing his nose at Transformers, Iron Man, and every doomsday movie we've ever seen. This entire movie was a spoof! C'mon, Elba's speech before the final battle was almost word for word the same as the President's speech in Independence Day; right down to the last line! ""Today we celebrate our Independence Day, I mean, Today, we cancel the apocalypse!"" The characters were even in the exact same position. (Spoiler follows). Remember how the dad gave his life in Independence Day while the sad, but proud son stood by? This was Del Toro sticking out his tongue at all of those movies. C'mon, did you see the heart of the main robot? Have you ever seen that before? I think Tony Stark built it. Taken as a serious movie, this would have been awful, unforgivable from anyone but Del Toro. Watch it again, but this time, watch it knowing, it's all a big joke! Did you ever see Blazing Saddles or Mars Attacks? If those were supposed to be serious movies, you'd say they were awful. But understanding satire, knowing they were supposed to be a joke, you laughed, and probably bought the movie so you could watch it again and laugh even more. I dare you, those who thought this was a bad movie. Watch it once more with this perspective. Nice move, Sr. Del Toro. You had everyone fooled."

","--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--<br/><br/>As far as blockbuster movies go, this one is only a few steps ahead of the rest. As far as monster movies go, you can't ask for anything better! Blockbuster movies are not suppose to be about the plot, and although Christopher Nolan films have proved you can have an intelligent summer flick, Pacific Rim tries to play up both brain and fluff, and to mostly positive effect.<br/><br/>The film is about these giant creatures called Kaiju, threatening the existence of mankind, and only man piloted jaegers are capable of taking them on, until one day when the jaeger's are defeated in battle, and the whole jaeger program is contemplated as an acceptable battle system. <br/><br/>The story and characters really just exist to add a world to the film beyond the giant monster battles, and about half way through you'll probably have already figured out where it is going or whether or not you even care. The supposed sad moments aren't really that sad, and the surprises aren't really that surprising, aside from one of two instances. The plot and the probability of the plot are so thinly stretched and far fetched at times that suspending disbelief becomes an exercise in futility. In short, don't watch this for the story. <br/><br/>The movie is a giant homage to the monster movies of old, so drawing comparison's between this and Godzilla, Gamera, or even Voltron can't help but happen at times. Unfortunately a greater portion than not of this film bares more resemblance to it's contemporaries on just about every level. <br/><br/>On a whole, however, Del Toro's signature style and all it's monster mayhem is all this movie needs to stand as a great summer feature. Most of the characters are forgettable, and the performances are standard fair. See it for the battles, as they are perhaps some of the best special effects you'll see in recent memory, and while they may be reminiscent of any CGI sequence found in a Transformers movie, comparing the two would be doing a huge injustice to Pacific Rim, and also deeply insulting to it."

Especially Gypsy danger kicking ass of every Kaiju she encounters. The story was decent, and if you look for plot holes in an action movie, you cannot enjoy it, ever.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like was some cliché situations, such as Raleigh's escape from his past, a 'only you can do it' re-call by the chief, and some buddy pair scenes.

"siderite","8","3","5","14 October 2013"," Leave your brain at home and you will love this film
","This film is a successful blend of Japanese mecha and American hero movies, although I personally am not a fan of either. Therefore the fact that I liked it has to mean something. <br/><br/>First thing you have to do in order to enjoy the film, though, is leave out logic, critical thinking or any knowledge of physics and/or biology. This is not a movie about real life, so deal with it. Once you do that (bring nothing to the drift, so to speak) you will probably enjoy the film because it is really well done and lots of fun.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: on the bottom of the Pacific ocean there is a dimensional rift through which giant Godzilla like monsters are coming through. The human solution is to build giant humanoid robots and punch the monsters to death. Yeah, I know. In a way, it is a sort of Top Gun with interdimensional alien monsters rather than Russians. Also the main character is impossible not to like: he is heroic, but also thoughtful and calculated, so completely different from Maverick.<br/><br/>As usual, Idris Elba is a supporting character who by his selfless actions saves the world, then dies and the beautiful Caucasian lead gets all the credit. A tip of the hat to the Japanese origins of the mecha mythos, the female lead is Japanese, although she doesn't do much. Other known actors have small roles, to my chagrin. Ron Perlman plays as well (stay until the credits to see a final scene with him). The scientists are great, although perhaps their geekiness is a bit over the top and unnecessarily so.<br/><br/>The special effects are almost flawless and, combined with heroic music and bar fight action scenes enlarged times a million, makes it almost impossible not to have fun. Heed my advice and do not think of solutions to the problems presented in the film, or you'll feel like the guy in the Shark Pool trailer. Just go with the flow. I find it ironic that in order to enjoy the film most you must follow the instructions given to the Jaeger pilots. I do hope that was intentional, if a bit cynical.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I was sure I was not going to enjoy it and I was very wrong. My head still buzzes with alternative scenarios in the same conceptual world, but the path that Guillermo del Toro took was both crowd pleasing and respectful to the feel of Japanese mecha, thus I have no quarrel with it at all. So go watch the film."

","Guillermo Del Toro's films have always been successful in creating fantasy, visual-effects driven extraordinary world. Pacific Rim is larger than life flick with fantastic CGI and engrossing story.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim tells the story of human struggle in waging a war against monster alien sea creatures who are on the verge of destroying all the cities in the world.<br/><br/>As the movie begins , you are introduced to the world of Kaiju the sea creature and it might take some time for you to get engrossed in the film. As the characters build , the movie embarks on the fabulous journey to fight against the monsters. Hats off to Del Toro for keeping you entertained with captivating direction and enthralling action sequences. Screenplay is decent which is loosing the grip in between. Art direction is awesome along with stunning cinematography. Not much can be said about the performance as it is action driven cinema. I loved the background score of the film.

Exceptional acting by Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi. Del Toro out-proved everybody with the amazing sets as well as the realistic Kaiju's. The ""drift"" story was original and interesting just like this movie. It is actually amazing how these sets were made in real life including the huge head of the Jaeger. Charlie Day's character got a bit annoying but Ron Perlman definitely handled his part like a legend. Without doubt, this movie is worth a watch, and most probably a second!

Making a movie of a monster/alien and getting things right is another. Yes, this type of movie is not everyone's cup of tea but even so I'm sure the most dramatics minded person would appreciate the CGI. CGI was breath taking for starters. This movie also amazed me with the plot. The story line was near perfect for a movie of this gender - it was unique too. There weren't any plot holes, There weren't any unexplained moments, it had fun in it - not over the top nor carried away, acting was great I thought.

","Guillermo del Toro has got to be the worst director/writer ever. I rented this without realizing it was his work. Like his other movies, this one assumes the viewers have no brain. Very insulting to watch.<br/><br/>The whole concept is incredibly juvenile. Typical of shonen (aimed at young boys) anime. Some bad guy shows up and missiles from jets, tanks, and other military weapons just can't affect it. Instead we need a giant humanoid robot driven by spunky and/or damaged young people. Every monster I saw in this movie would be annihilated by a normal jet with a few rockets, max. Humanoid robots that fight mostly by punching or maybe wielding a sword are not better weapons than jets with rockets. Also typical of anime: both parties begin their fight with weak attacks, then they power up and use better weapons, then power up again. So stupid.<br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be a single character in this movie. Only stereotypes, from the two nerds bumbling around to the world leaders that make earth-critical decisions without listening to all the facts/evidence. Every single person is one-dimensional and stylized. Every cliché you can imagine is present. Except for the first 5 minutes there is not a single time when you can't predict the next 30 minutes at least.<br/><br/>I think this movie did well overseas because subtlety and realism are completely lost in translation. What you need are extreme characters that leave no question in anyone's mind about what their role in the movie is.<br/><br/>For many years movies have become more and more realistic and gritty. This one has the detailed and beautiful special effects but the whole plot and every human relationship just doesn't make sense. In short, I hated this movie. It's far worse than other giant-but-not-thought-out movies."

The lead actress has two expressions, both require no ability. The males act like teenagers in rut. The fight scenes are reminiscent of fake TV wrestling. This was made for those whose shoe size is bigger than their IQ.<br/><br/>Such a waste of talent from the director. What could be worse than the Iron Man trilogy? Than the Avengers?

In this case his brother (Diego Klatenhoff). Now he's really motivated! Two very nerdy scientists,(Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) discover how to kill the monsters after an earlier demoralizing defeat and with only two giant WCF style robots left in the fleet. In the process they were forced to do business with Hannibal (Ron Pearlman)who runs a used monster body parts lot. The hero's love interest was a lovely Oriental(Rinko Kikuchi)who was teaching the robot pilots how to fight while strapped in the bot's head. She later joins Hunnam in the giant robot as co-pilot because two brains have to be linked together in order to control the Bot. No conversation necessary because they are ""in"" each other's brains. Idris Elba was the token Black guy and leader of the Bot fleet and step pa of Rinko we discovered as Hunnam explored her brain. The only human ""kind of"" bad guy was Chuck (Robert Kazinksky) but he also became a hero after seeing the error of his ways. The two lovebirds ejected themselves to the surface from the crippled robot after beating up the monsters in a battle at the bottom of the ocean. The only ethnic group not well represented were Hispanics. They'll take care of that in the sequel 'Pacific Rim Dos'. Special effects were very good and they didn't waste much time telling the familiar story. A good 75% of the movie was CG Bots and Monsters swinging at each other."

"RolloTomasi","4","4","8","27 July 2013"," No matter how many times you remake Independence Day...
","...it doesn't get better. I do like ""ID4"" but sci-fi writers looking for a plot keep stealing from it. They may not even realize they're doing it on a conscious level. I recently reviewed ""Oblivion"" which also borrows from ""ID4."" What I'm complaining about is this nuclear endgame that always pops up. It's become this deux ex machina that solves everything (and no, a nuclear reactor that melts down does not result in a nuclear explosion, as this film's homepage points out). Also, PR rips off the ""hive mind"" idea (and even calls it the same thing) from ID4. Remember the scene in ID4 where the president's mind is linked with the alien pilot's and he discovers their secret plan? Again, directly ripped off by Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>But really, all this thievery's not a big deal as long as the story that surrounds it is sound. But PR is a mess. It never makes up its mind how seriously it wants to be taken. No character is interesting, or even very likable. At least ID4 had Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum odd couple to inject comedy into the proceedings, especially the ending. What's so unique (still) about ID4 is how the world comes together with existing technology (and old school strategies like morse code) to scrap with and beat the technologically advanced aliens. PR wants you to believe that in a few years we would have the technology to build these giant man-controlled robots operated through a mind-meld. What a mess.<br/><br/>I will say that the fight scenes and CGI of Pacific Rim are commendable. That said, though, it's not enough. Filmmakers aren't even making films any more. they're making cartoons. This is a whole other subject but--there is a reason that these horror movies are coming along and burying the big-budget ""tentpole"" films studios parade out during the summer. The horror genre is still rooted in the basic elements of filmmaking: shot selection and editing. An audience wants to get emotionally involved. They're not impressed by computer-generated monsters any more. A film is story, camera angles, revelation, lighting, music, character, editing. Nothing's ever going to change that."

"Turfseer","2","5","11","5 December 2013"," Attempt to update Godzilla genre is strictly for aficionados of violent video games
","'Pacific Rim', noted director Guillermo Del Toro's attempt to update the old Japanese Godzilla monster genre, can best be described as a colossal waste of money. The setting is a decade from now. The monsters, called Kaiijus, have escaped from an inter-dimensional rift on the ocean floor and wreak havoc all over earth. In response, mankind have developed Jaegers, giant humanoid contraptions, piloted by two humans, who work in tandem via a mind meld of sorts. We're introduced to Raleigh Becket, a former Jaeger pilot who lost his brother while they were battling one of the Kaiijus a few years before. Becket is called out of retirement as the commander of the Jaegers, Stacker Pentecost, believes he's the best for the job.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the plot makes little sense. The Jaeger program is discontinued as the giant machines are no match for the overpowering Kaiijus. Instead, the powers that be decide to construct giant walls to protect earth's population from the monsters. The only problem is that the walls are completely flimsy and collapse after the first Kaiiju attack. Why then did they believe the walls would work at all? <br/><br/>Despite the order to discontinue the Jaeger program, Pentecost seeks to throw one last 'Hail Mary' by dropping a thermonuclear bomb into the rift, cutting off the Kaiiju's portal to earth. Instead of simply showing one big monster battle after another, most of Act II involves finding a new partner for Becket. He ends up with Mako Mori, a Japanese director of a Jaeger refurbishment project, who also happens to be Pentecost's adopted daughter. Mori wants to team up with Becket, but her over protective parent, Pentecost, is against it. <br/><br/>Mori almost blows her chance when memories of a Kaiiju killing her parents interferes with the mind meld with Becket, causing the Jaeger they're testing, to go berserk. If this isn't enough, there's also a sub-plot concerning two scientists, one of whom, Geiszler, establishes a mental link with the Kaiiju brain. He goes to Hong Kong where he meets up with Chau, played by an over the top Ron Perlman, who is a black market dealer in Kaiiju body parts. Keiszler figures out that the good guys can only gain access to the portal if the Kaiiju recognize their own DNA.<br/><br/>No need to rehash the rest of the plot. It's pretty obvious that the good guys manage to drop the bomb into the portal and cut off the Kaiiju access. Of course there's a whole bunch of boring Monster-Humanoid battle scenes before that, probably most enjoyed by aficionados of violent video games.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim didn't do that well at the box office here in the US but cleaned up overseas. Casting pretty Japanese Rinko Kakuchi as the co-star was a brilliant casting move, which undoubtedly had a lot to do with the film's success in the Asian market. <br/><br/>In the end, Pacific Rim is a pointless attempt to update the Godzilla genre. The action sequences are repetitious and the human drama is stilted and predictable. The only thing I enjoyed in the entire film is when Ron Perlman cuts himself out of the baby Kaiiju, during the post-credit sequence. That at least WAS amusing!"

Realising that current weaponry isn't effective in bringing a Kaiju down quickly enough, humans work together to come up with new technology to defeat the creatures. This technology comes in the shape of Jaegers...giant robot-like war machines. When the attacks start happening more frequently, a plan to close the tear is devised but this brings about it's own obvious risks.

Not here though, and this is a classic example of movie makers relying more on gorgeous effects than story to win audiences over.<br/><br/>The acting - especially by Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket - is nothing to write home about either and is very cringeworthy at times.

I can't say anything without spoiling the movie, and you may well think ""how the hell do you figure that out?"", but after watching it you'll see the similarities between the two.

","It was a curious thing being on line for certain Hollywood programmers in summer 2013, mediocre stuff like 2 Guns or White House Down that neither impressed nor offended too much, and then the split in hearing some other folks talking about Pacific Rim and how awful it looked.<br/><br/>Perhaps I came to it with a small chip on the shoulder – this is THE Guillermo mother-flipping del Toro, after all, a man who has created dark, supremely designed imaginations with Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy movies, and here he is getting to take on stuff he loves in a completely B-movie landscape: gnarly monsters, giant robots, comic-book stakes, and action with some substance. And Pacific Rim, for what it set out to accomplish as a sensational blockbuster, reached its aims for what I wanted. When taken in total, it may not have much more or less action than a Man of Steel, but it is much smarter, or just more creative and skilled and knowing of its audience, in layering out its action set pieces, and even in the broad strokes it takes as, basically, a B-level Saturday matinée flick. Del Toro cares about these characters, or at least tries to, deep down, and can show some of that like with the Asian pilot Mako Maori.<br/><br/>Is any of this deep? I'm still not sure. Does it need to be an artistic meditation on the cancelling of the apocalypse? Maybe another watch or two of five - because there will always be a part of me that can keep a hold on to an inner 13 year old - will bring that into focus. And aside from the monsters-and-robot work, which contains such good sights to behold, weight and depth to the designs, and the know-how to pace the action and to let us see it – in 2D, anyway, I didn't bother with 3D so I can't speak to that experience – there's some just good fun dialog (Charlie Day! Ron Perlman!!) and a sense that, 'Yes, this is a Godzilla experience, but we can still make it EXCITING'. So much of what I wanted this summer and only got in smaller doses (look at the end of the article for a bit on that) was in full-bloom in this production, which had a 190 million budget and the money looked like it was up on the screen, and not just in the CG but in the big sets and technology, and a story told by a Big Kid that would only hope the rest of the audience can genuinely feel like Big Kids if they aren't young already.<br/><br/>In other words, the director accomplished what Michael Bay has, over and over again, failed to do: inspire wonder, and put some basic thought into the process itself, in story and craft, and without a large dollop of cynicism."

Pacific Rim is a fitting and perfect tribute to every one of those wonderful creations of the past.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I went back six times to watch the same movie. 10/10"
"crowley-4","4","2","3","27 September 2014"," Visually spectacular with terrible script and acting
","I watched this on DVD at home. Too bad I didn't see it in 3D in a cinema as the visuals are spectacular. Big monsters fighting big robots in Hong Kong and under the sea - what's not to like if you were ever a young boy!<br/><br/>The script was the worst I have heard in recent memory. I know Idris Elba can act (eg. The Wire) but in this movie he bears a constant pained expression which reflects the dire situation his character is in, and perhaps his regret at having accepted a role of any sort in such a film.<br/><br/>Given the focus on realistic graphics (monsters, robots, water effects, cities being demolished, etc.), it's disappointing that the producers didn't feel it necessary to have the human characters behave or talk like real humans.<br/><br/>This film teaches our children once again that when faced with something inexplicable and dangerous, scientists are weirdos who can't be trusted, while aggression, weaponry and self-confidence will ensure victory. It's a thoroughly ""American"" film, which reflects the country's gun culture and jingoism in today's news stories.<br/><br/>My 11 year old son enjoyed it. I just hope he doesn't take it to heart."

","This movie is wrong on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. So I'm starting with the only positive note I have found. The battle scenes are so awesome. The giant robots and monster fist fighting, that's something I'd really love to see again.<br/><br/>Now for the easier part of my writing, the story is so familiar. This is the most common military vs alien story. ""Our hero loses his older brother in the first part and drifts away from his job. Then when the world faces an alien invasion threat, a general/commander brings that hero back our last resort. But since he left, a new poster boy has risen, who is now jealous of the old hero's return. Men upstairs give some wrong orders. The commander decides to disobey. He gives a cheap motivational speech.<br/><br/>""Then comes the final battle. Non-American comrades die easily as some overrated soldiers. Disaster porn. Our hero comes to save the day. More disaster porn. Disaster porn, disaster porn.<br/><br/>""The egotistic poster boy sacrifices himself to give our hero one last chance to save the world. But our hero wastes that extra time for his love. That stupid decision makes everyone in front of monitors think the hero died. But the hero comes back from death. And of course he saves the world.""<br/><br/>Now remember how many times have we seen this crap before. You had a budget of 190 millions dollar. Get a better story. Then get better actors. The performances of the actors were very awkward for me, I don't wanna elaborate.<br/><br/>You've seen this movie before, trust me. Don't waste 2 hours."

","When i first saw the trailer for Pacific Rim i thought this film was going to be mental! Having giant robots and monsters fight isn't something I've seen since i was a kid watching Mighty Morphin Power Rangers so i couldn't wait to see this film, As a kid i loved stuff like Power Rangers, Transformers, Godzilla and all that and i'm a fan of Guillermo Del Toro as well. I enjoyed both Hellboy films, Pans Labyrinth and Blade 2 so i had faith that this film would be something special. When the film finally came out I went to see it as soon as I could, After watching the trailers I was expecting an all out action / Sci-Fi with good fight scenes and a cool story that kept me interested through out and kept me entertained. This film did exactly that! I was glad to see that this film doesn't take itself to serious and has fun with all the crazy Sci-Fi stuff they have. There wasn't much with this film i didn't enjoy but this is a list of the stuff i liked about Pacific Rim -<br/><br/>* The whole concept and theme of this film, It was like re-living my childhood and getting excited when you know theirs going to be a huge fight at the end of a Power Rangers episode. You know this is going to be a huge CGI fest so you don't need a believable story or to much character development, Its just feeling entertained by watching giant robots punch monsters in the face!<br/><br/>* The visual effects were outstanding, The use of colour and the way the Jaegers looked as they moved. Comparing them to the only other CGI robots i can think of, Micheal Bays Transformers, The Jaegers move around better and feel a lot more robot like to the Transformers and the colour schemes used on them were much more interesting. The Kaiju looked amazing as well! each one had its own unique look and strengths and the use of CGI really enhances it.<br/><br/>* The soundtrack was epic, You knew when they main theme song came on you know their was going to be something epic about to happen.<br/><br/>* The Jaegers, I was glad to that each Jaeger was unique to itself and they all had different kind of abilities and looks and they all had really cool names. I thought the main Jaeger 'Gypsy Danger' was pretty cool looking, He had cool elbow rockets that made the fight scene that little bit more enjoyable and a cool looking sword that could have been introduced in the first fight but was still cool when he got it out, 'Crimson Typhoon' had a third arm, 'Striker Eureka' to me looked very similar to Gundam Wing and 'Cherno Alpha' was this huge Russian Jaeger that was pretty cool!<br/><br/>* The time Gypsy Danger uses a freighter like a crow-bar on one of the Kaiju!<br/><br/>* The Kaiju, They all looked so good! each of them were like giant amphibious creatures that literally just want to destroy stuff! Since these creatures seem to put up a fight to normal military equipment you know theirs going to be a cool fight waiting for them when the Jaegers get about. <br/><br/>* I really liked Charlie Day as one of the scientists working on Kaiju, He was probably my favourite character though the whole film.<br/><br/>* Idris Elba, I'm a fan of him, I don't think I've ever seen him in a role i haven't enjoyed and he gives one of the coolest speeches in seen in a film in a long time. <br/><br/>* The dog! One of the Jaeger pilots have this unbelievably cute dog which i loved seeing on screen!<br/><br/>There were a few things that stopped me from giving this film 10 stars, stuff like -<br/><br/>* I found Raleigh's accent pretty annoying, i got used to it after a while but yeah, its pretty annoying.<br/><br/>* The syncing two pilots together in order to get a Jaeger to work. A big chunk of the middle of this film was about getting the Mako Mori to sync up with Raleigh Beckett, I didn't quite get why those two could be drift compatible, i thought it was only for family members. During the beginning i pretty sure Raleigh pilots it on his own when his Brother dies. I didn't get it, But it still looks Cool!<br/><br/>* I found it to be painfully slow when the Jaegers had to move quickly or had to charge up their plasma cannons, It felt like the Kaiju were much quicker that them.<br/><br/>* During fights with the Jaegers and the Kaiju they kept jumping from scenes into the Cockpit to hear the pilots speaking, I didn't mind it to much but i would of preferred to see more robot monster fight scenes. <br/><br/>Overall it was still a cool film and if you enjoyed Power Rangers and Godzilla as a kid your inner child will love this film! This film deserves to have a good few sequels since the universe they've made has so many opportunities to make more! If your looking for a film with giant monsters and giant robots this is the film for you!"

","I didn't go into this movie expecting much.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I was entertained, I felt it was worth the price of a matinée ticket, but aside from that, it was really nothing more than an FX movie. It was all eye candy and no substance.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes were pretty entertaining, but again, aside from some good action, they could have just blotted out all of the dialog. I mean, all that movie really needed was the ambient noise and explosions. It was kinda like Aliens vs Predator in that regard, the humans really just took away from the movie."
"LiveLoveLead","5","2","3","13 April 2014"," Not as good as i'd heard...
","Actually, pretty disappointing. This film was a mix of Godzilla, Real Steele, Transformers and Independence Day...but all those movies did it better. The good stuff: lots of action, special effects, and it does have a plot. The bad stuff: decent actors trying to pull off poor writing and poor directing. The lame writing made for some corny, and some drab dialogue. The actors/characters didn't have any chemistry or depth. They were so bland that you didn't really care about them. I love Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba, but even their characters were boring, and under developed. The researchers/scientists, played by Gorman & Day were just annoying. They were supposed to add some comic relief, but they were just silly. I think this movie will be mostly enjoyed by kids/YA, especially boys, who will enjoy the robots, aliens and the fighting/action scenes (as far as kids go, the language isn't too bad, the s-word once, lots of God d- mn, and a handful of b--ch, a--, h-ll, etc.; no f-word or nudity) I give this a 5.3 stars. There are much better films out there in my humble opinion."

","In the near future, the Earth comes under attack from gigantic creatures that emerge from an inter-dimensional gateway in the Pacific seabed; the world's nations put aside their differences to fight back, developing massive robot warriors (called Jaegers) piloted by a pair of humans with a shared consciousness.<br/><br/>With Pacific Rim, the battle is well and truly on. I'm not talking about the battle between robots and monsters around which the film revolves, but rather the battle between Guillermo Del Toro and Michael Bay to see who can make the most expensive, most tedious, most special effects driven piece of mainstream blockbuster drivel humanly possible.<br/><br/>In an attempt to go one better than Bay's Transformers series, Del Toro's Pacific Rim not only features massive mechanoids causing untold damage but also throws in enormous monsters (known as Kaiju) for good measure. The result is a charmless mess of bland performances, difficult to follow, state-of-the-art digital mayhem, and nonsensical plot developments designed to please those viewers for whom logic, narrative cohesion and convincing acting are of little importance just as long as stuff gets destroyed on a massive scale.<br/><br/>Transformers 4 and Pacific Rim 2 will no doubt up the ante even further—and probably prove all the more terrible for it."
"chrismccloughen","3","2","3","22 February 2014"," A Disappointment
","Yes, Pacific Rim has great CGI and some of the fight scenes are good and then some are just plain stupid. A sword that finally appears towards the end of a battle? Why wasn't it used earlier? Some of the acting was poor, the script needed a lot more spit and polish, and mainly, it just needed more plausibility. Why would jet aircraft with stand off missiles that could be used miles away, or at least with cannons that could be used far enough away as too not be swatted by the monsters, have the need to fly so close to shoot bullets? Ludicrous, or had I fallen asleep by that time and missed any explanation offered to this!? A little more awful and Pacific Rim might have edged itself towards the, ""its so bad its almost good sort of science fiction that becomes a cult hit"". But no, it's firmly rooted in mediocrity and deserves to live out its rental days in the ""Blah"" section of the video store. I am a lover of science fiction, but not of this type of big budget nonsense. Rent if you must but please remove your faculty for reasoning first. You have been warned."
"Holstareleven11","2","2","3","10 February 2014"," Sci-fi not worth watching in full or ever again!
","This film had so much potential. Amazing movie posters, incredible nail biting trailers and a promising cast. So where did it all go wrong? A main storyline filled with plot holes, awkward screenplay filled with racial stereotypes and poorly directed scenes.<br/><br/>The acting had a non-intentional comical feel which greatly conflicted with the storyline and was very distracting. However not directly to the fault of the actors themselves, the uncomfortable cliché 'one-liners' and senseless scenes where everyone just screams and dies is resulted from poorly written scripts and directing. Also, the unsellable foreign aspects of the film is riddled with racial stereotypes and slanders. Such derogatory scenes even included a ""Russian"" woman wearing an eye-patch and grunting like a masculine commando, purely retched material.<br/><br/>To sum up, although it had lots of CGI eye candy, it was painful to watch. The main story is filled with holes and is lost to the action in the film. This could have been avoided if the side-story, 'about a girl', was expanded and adapted into the main story. In addition, the actors struggle to uphold the seriousness of the film due to distasteful scripts and directing. Also, the drama scenes dragged out too long and the anticipation of the cool robot on alien scenes did not compensate.<br/><br/>Best if fast-forwarding straight to action scenes, a sci-fi not worth watching in full or ever again. 2 out of 10 stars."

","I Love Guillermo Del Toro. the man has a twisted imagination, he makes some very incredibly scary Monsters. From Mimic to Hellboy II and Pan's Labyrinth, he's been scaring the Bejeezus out of us for over a decade. And we keep coming back for more.<br/><br/>He even had a small hand in the creation of Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" - And in a way I am glad that Guillermo did not direct that, as he said that making Pan's Labyrinth almost killed him, I think The Hobbit would have been too much for him.<br/><br/>But Pacific Rim was not - And he did it, Del Toro did a GOOD JOB on Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>I think what people do not realize is how much of himself Guillermo Del Toro puts into his movies. A Lot of work, and a Lot of Love.<br/><br/>So when I first heard of this movie a few years ago, I was not sure I understood what it was to be about - And I was correct, you cannot easily quantify what kind of Movie Pacific Rim is. Is it a Monster Movie? Yes. Is it a movie about Giant Monsters? Yes. Is it like Robot Jox? YES.<br/><br/>So what we get is a cross between Robot Jox and Robotech - Men Piloting Huge Mechanical Robots, which are Man's Only Tools to fight an enemy which puts man on the scale of an Insect under these enemies' Boots- Er, Claws, Er, Appendages.<br/><br/>And so we get to see the level of destruction from the first frame of this film, and not only the use of Huge Robots, but we are told about ""The Drift"" - Two Minds merged together through the Machine, two men working as one, Is this a Love Story? In all ways, this is a Love story between Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) and Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam). But it is also a love story between Raleigh and his late brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) - And also between Mako and her Surrogate Father Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). And between the Father/Son Team of Herc Hansen (Max Martini) and Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky) - And finally even love between the oddest of odd couples ever: Doctors Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and ""Gottleib"" (Burn Gorman).<br/><br/>Why? Because all of these people have shared ""The Drift"" in some form or another.<br/><br/>""The Drift"" is not only a technical solution which allows two Pilots to Merge into basically a single Brain, Left and Right hemispheres, for Piloting a Jaeger - It's also a Gimmick created by Guillermo Del Toro to help us understand the relationships between these people.<br/><br/>And this gimmick works better for that than strictly as a means for two Pilots to drive a Jaeger.<br/><br/>Through this Gimmick, we understand Raleigh's loss of Yancy. We understand the antagonism of the two ""Scientists"" Gottlieb and Geiszler, antagonism peppered with healthy respect. We understand Pentecost's protectiveness over Mako, as we see through her eyes how she perceived her Savior Pentecost when she sees him for the first time as a little girl holding one red shoe.<br/><br/>It is Pentecost's Final Words to Mako which has a bittersweet ring to it: ""You can Always Find me, In the drift"".<br/><br/>And when he says this, we KNOW, that he is not going to be dead, that he will always be there in Mako's Mind each time she relives that moment where she sees her Knight in Shining Armor arise from the Cockpit of a Jaeger.<br/><br/>It is not just the digital imagery used to portray men fighting huge monsters, Digital Imagery which succeeds rather than fails on all kinds of levels - But it is the Imagery Guillermo has created- This WORLD he created and has given to us, to either live in, and enjoy with him, or to not bother- This fantastic Future Landscape which holds enough Future Shock to kill 1,000 Alvin Toffler's - THIS is what has been given to us with these images- And the way the Digital Images are blended with the practical Film effects, so we do not know where one ends and the other begins.<br/><br/>In fact, one documentary I had read from, describes that the Kaijus were designed as if they were to be like the suits worn by Men in old Godzilla Movies- And in fact the way the Kaijus Move are very much like ""Men in Suits"" - Only that I have heard Guillermo talking about creating large monsters in other films, particularly in Hellboy - that he animated the ""Sammael"" daemons so that the movements were more like Animal Movements- He did MUCH the same here with the Kaiju Movements. <br/><br/>But I am glad I bothered to watch this film - It has taken me a whole month to think about how I would write this review. It is because of the deep Humanity which this story shows us, love and respect, that I choose to respect it's director for.<br/><br/>Because on top of all of these deep Human and Spiritual aspects of this story, Guillermo has given us a nonstop event filled with action, and when the Pilots get into their Jaegers, we get into the cockpit alongside them. And when Raleigh falls into the Rift with the carcass of the first Category-Five Kaiju, we fall down that rabbit hole with them, and when we see the Leader of the Invading Aliens, and the FEAR in his three or four Eyes, we can REALLY see that fear, and this makes that moment much more satisfying for us as viewers and participators in the story.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro is much different than other directors of today. Even here we can see his earlier efforts as influences - And one thing I know that Guillermo always carries around is his Notebook.<br/><br/>Thank you Guillermo, and I'm still waiting for Hellboy Three!"

","Giant, multi piloted robots fighting giant monsters?

","I was looking forward to 'Pacific Rim', like an adult reliving his childhood. I grew up with Transformers and Voltron, robots and monsters, dinosaurs and aliens - so 'Pacific Rim', to me, was going to be fun. <br/><br/>If I had watched it without sound, I would have loved it. Sure, CGI is at a point now where anything is possible, and the majority of CGI work now is great, but watch the movie with sound, and become bitterly disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm Australian, so when foreigners try to act Australian, I watch (well listen) closely. The Aussie accents were bad. Atrocious to be honest. They were over-done, and forced, like most of the acting throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Why the Australian father/son team had a British bulldog, I'll never know. Surely a Kelpie would be more appropriate? <br/><br/>Many reviews here pan the two scientists we see on their own quests to understand the Kaiju and ultimate eliminate them. One, a Rick Moranis wanna-be is both annoying, yet entertaining. He's hypo, lively, active and quick, so stands out from the other dull performances given by the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>I've read other reviews here and agree totally with those who ask why and how about various plot holes through which the Kaiji themselves could fly. So I add nothing new to add. But I do agree.<br/><br/>It really is a movie for kids, despite the fighting, the death and the badly-acted emotional sub-plots. But at least they'll enjoy the robots and monsters at the innocent child-like level I was hoping to. Sure I went in wanting to be a 10 year old again, but being almost 40 made me see the movie as a professional product from Hollywood, and at that, I was disappointed."

I was going into this having watched The Man of Steel and was thinking with lots of money you can make a good film out of anything these days. Well, I was wrong. Almost every scene with no kaiju in it is painfully bad. No characters, no dialogs, no ideas. Everything is so corny it's just pure irritation to watch. The characters are so unrelatable I could not care less for what was going on. A suicide to save the world? Whatever... And that part with a sword in space just blew my mind.

"callanvass","7","2","3","24 December 2013"," It's far from perfect but the action makes it a pretty enjoyable blockbuster
","I've grown tired of summer blockbusters. I love action movies but with all the Transformer movies, comic book adaptations, among others things, it gets a bit much after a while. Pacific Rim is typically overlong but I can't deny how enjoyable it is. The middle is a bit slow at times. I thought it got a bit too talky at times, and my interest began to wane. I did love the final 40/50 minutes. The final 40/50 minutes is absolutely packed with non-stop carnage and destruction. It's loaded with CGI; don't get me wrong, it just didn't bother me. The production design is extremely impressive, and it's amazing visually. The destruction on the cities, the robots, the monsters all looked fantastic. My only problem as I explained above is that when you aren't being amazed by all of that stuff, it does tend to be a little mundane at certain points, but it has a lot more good than bad. The performances can be a little bland at times. Charlie Hunnam isn't the most exciting lead. He's OK at best. I never really got into his emotional plight. Since the movie is over two hours long, he didn't have nearly enough charisma to maintain my interest. Thankfully, the fantastic action tends to bail him out a lot of the time, but I wasn't all that impressed by him. Idris Elba is excellent as per usual. He's by far the most interesting character in this movie. His gruff, yet caring character was a blast to watch. Rinko Kikuchi is rather uninteresting as Mako. She has moments where she does good work. I just think she seemed a little uncomfortable during some of the meatier moments. Charlie Day is alternately funny and annoying as a scientist. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Aside from the mediocre performances, the rather boring middle section, I thought this was well above average for a blockbuster movie. It sets out to entertain the masses. It does that extremely well. Considering I had low expectations going in, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a little overlong but if you kick your brain to the curb, sit back, relax, and enjoy the abundance of destruction<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","Guillermo Del Toro has, first and foremost, been a visual director. Be it Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy or Hellboy 2 his level of visual flair is unsurpassed. More than that as evident from Pan's Labyrinth, he's also equally skillful in storytelling. Believe me Pan's Labyrinth is as twisted a simple fairytale can get. But he's had his fair share of hit and misses as well *cough* Don't be Afraid of the Dark *cough*. You know he's a good director when Peter Jackson himself chose Guilermo for directing The Hobbit trilogy. Unfortunately The Hobbit landed back in the hands of its own foster father than a step-dad. Its been 5 years since Guilermo's directed a movie. People thought he'd make a comeback with Hellboy but what came a surprise was Pacific Rim. First Look at its previews made me think ""oh yea, another Transformers clone"" but I was direly wrong. Pacific Rim is more than Michael Bay's Transformers, more than just an homage to Robots Vs Monsters movies as well.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is a nothing but glorified Power Rangers for adults movie, but it nevertheless entertain you. Basically its human-built giant robots, Jaegars, against giant alien monsters, Kaiju. What ensures is a huge huge robot on monster action with some drama sprinkled over the top. Pacific Rim, as soon as it starts puts you in the thick of action and clocking in at 132 minutes there was never a boring sequence. The writing was exactly what you'd expect in this genre. The lines were forced and at times very very clichéd but admit it you were neither in for performances or a plotyou were in for giant monsters vs giant robots and u get served pretty damn well and hot. The Drift was an interesting mechanic that serves as the backbone for the movie. Was a bit let down when other Jaegars didn't get enough screen-time as Gypsy Danger. Would have died to see the Russian one go a bit more. Most of the Kaiju encounters takes place at night and watching the movie in 3D felt a bit tedious as it was super dark I would have loved it if there was at least one head to head Kaiju fight in broad daylight. Then again the fight sequences were insanely detailed much much more than Transformers where we could only see blurs and metal scraps. Here in Pacific Rim each punch, each blow the Kaiju and Jaegers delivered was felt with equal force.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim doesn't have a star-studded cast and it doesn't need one when the the plot is focused on Jaegars and Kaijus. Idris Elba had always stood out be it whatever roles he was in. He plays Stacker Pentecost and his sheer flamboyance does an amazing job here as well. I was particularly impressed with his ""Do not let my calm demeanour fool you, ranger!"" line. Rinko Kikuchi, as Mako Mari was good. I'd loved her in The Brothers Bloom where she delivered a solid performance without uttering a word. Her backstory here was touching, have to give kudos to the kid who played little Mako as well. It struck to me as vaguely similar to the Kim Phuc photo during the Viatnamese War. Comic relief by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman were good, it sometimes felt as cheesy but it was integral in this genre of movies. Guilermo's favorite Ron Perlman does a short role by name Hannibal Chau serving some chuckles. I was disappointed with the inadequate performance from the lead, Charlie Hunnam. Of course I've heard people saying his resemblance with Tron Legacy's Sam Flynn but thats just where the resemblances end. I just couldn't buy into his performance.<br/><br/>Of course the real stars of Pacific Rim were the Jaegars and Kaiju and both were exquisitely detailed. Guillermo was never a stranger to monster designs, evident from some of the Hellboy and Pan Labyrinth monsters designed by himself.The Kaiju felt like intimidating hulking beasts of pure destruction and chaos and most of them modeled on monsterized versions of a shark, a gorilla etc. Loved them.<br/><br/>Ramin Djawadi's score is pure spellbinding. I need not give an example more than Game of Throne's booming score. He does his magic again here with Pacific Rim. His score with the awesome visuals is enough to induce goosebumps. It leaves us in awe and beckons to be heard again and again. Tracks like 'Pacific Rim' and 'Gipsy Danger' is pure awesomeness.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is undoubtedly flawed in writing, performances and plot but it what it lacks there, it makes up with style, action and thrills. Pacific Rim isn't even close to Guillermo's Pan's Labyrinth or Hellboy in terms of storytelling but it excites you and it does give you an adrenaline rush watching the action packed fights and its more than any fanboy could ask for. Summer movies cant get any BIGGER than this. Go watch it at the movies now!"
"slicedbread117","8","2","3","22 December 2013"," Action is the name of the game for this enormous film.
","Giant robots versus giant alien sea monsters. What more could a geek ask for? Pacific Rim looked exciting right from the first trailer, aiming to unleash the action nerd in all of us. While there are some fumbles along the way, Pacific Rim succeeds in bringing larger-than-life action to the big screen.<br/><br/>One of the first things you notice about Pacific Rim is the outstanding CGI. The visuals are at a top tier quality, some of the best I've ever seen in film. The fictional Kaiju race of aliens are brought to life along with their formidable foes, the human built Jaegers, through eye- popping CGI that really helps set the tone for what this movie is all about: gigantic action. Pacific Rim does not falter in delivering some of the biggest action scenes in recent time. The battles between the Jaegers and Kaiju just keep getting bigger, badder, and more epic as the movie goes on. The sheer scale of these monster battles is large enough to put even a movie like Transformers to shame. Mastermind Guillermo del Torro is in the directors chair for this film, and his vision to create a large-scale, CGI glorified action film is executed very well. The action sequences are gargantuan, and are highly entertaining to say the least.<br/><br/>Where Pacific Rim thrives most is on the battlefield, focusing all of its attention on the clashes between the Jaegers and Kaiju. Where the movie falters is during the non-action scenes where it tries to tell an engaging story with characters you care about. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action in this film, but too often does the movie stray away from the epic battles and tries to tell a smaller story inside this massive conflict, and it at times slows the movie down, nearly to a screeching halt. The plot is pretty straightforward, and while it has its short comings and clichés, it's good enough to be entertaining and at the same time not complete non-sense. Again, this is an action heavy movie, and when Pacific Rim gets too far away from that, it starts to show some of its weaknesses.<br/><br/>The cast does an OK job, with the better performances coming from Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam as Stacker Pentecost and Raleigh Becket respectively. Charlie Day, one of my personal favorite actors, and best known for his work on It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, provides comedic relief but doesn't quite fit the bill for this movie and his character seemed almost annoying at times. Rinko Kikuchi plays Mako Mori, and her performance was far and away the worst of any of the cast members, showing almost no emotion in her acting. Overall the cast was mediocre only adding a more human element to the sort of monster vs. monster theme.<br/><br/>It won't keep you emotionally attached, it won't get you deep into its story, and it won't make you care for the small stories outside of the action. But what Pacific Rim will do, is provide exhilarating action sequences supplemented by stunning CGI and keep you largely entertained by the super-sized battles that only get bigger and better as the movie progresses. <br/><br/>8/10"

Maybe the anime roots of the storyline are to blame, but I can really not stomach the ""hero loses someone close to him"", ""hero overcomes the adversity"", ""hero gets the girl"", ""hero saves the world"", etc. themes in this movie. It's a cliché after cliché and if it were done at least as a tongue-in-cheek adaptation, it would be worth something.<br/><br/>I really liked Charlie Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy and Green Street Hooligans, but he is HORRIBLE in this movie. Every time he said or did something in the movie, it came across forced, fake and simply unbelievably bad.<br/><br/>The FAKE Aussie accent of the Hansens' characters is abominable. <br/><br/>I think Idris Elba is one redeeming thing about this movie (acting wise). He and Ron Perlman make the movie bearable to watch. Ron btw doesn't even need to say any lines, he has a presence on the screen that itself can change the atmosphere of the whole movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion: I will most likely forget this movie very soon. 5 stars for Idris, Ron, awesome robots and CGI. Everything else about this movie is forgettable."

Giant monsters going head to head with giant robots.<br/><br/>Normally I'd scoff at this, but the director is so enamored with his love of all things monster related (and believe me, it shows) that you can't help but feel his passion.<br/><br/>There's flat dialogue, sure, but do we care?

You get that same feeling at minute 15 here.<br/><br/>""Oh... he's gonna die, they will fall in love, that thing will get smashed, and they will save the earth...""<br/><br/>And after that you just enjoy the special effects without any thrill what so ever.

"Pingo-2","6","2","3","16 October 2013"," Corny and childish - but nice action.
","It still surprises me that one can get $190M USD to make superior action and wonderful CGI in a 131 minute movie - but leave out character development and serious and realistic sounding dialog. The ""scientists"" sounds like mice (are probably supposed to be funny) and the characters are, well... kinda boring.<br/><br/>Too many HOORAH's and applauding scenes for me - not really sure why they're there anyway, it just makes a pretty stupid film more dorky.<br/><br/>That said - the action sequences are beautiful and cool. The ""aliens"" are nice, though nothing you haven't seen before. Conveniantly, they have flashlights in their mouths too! It's sad that there are almost no Huge Robot-movies that can handle this theme with respect and make something serious. All Giant Robot movies doesn't have to be for kids. GANHEDDO (1989) is probably one of the only darker live-action giant robot films ever made.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is nothing but CGI animations battling it out for total destruction. There's no suspense, no build ups, no real movie here. But as a CGI show-reel, this is amazing.<br/><br/>To be honest - the live action parts can be fast-forwarded (except for the Mako flashback scene, which is good - especially since it lacks dialog).<br/><br/>I give it a 6 out of 10 anyway, because the director is a hero, Rinko Kikuchi did a great job - and I simply LOVE Giant Robots!"

"jaredkjacoby","9","1","1","10 May 2020"," One of the most entertaining and creative blockbusters of the 21st Century
","Kaiju emerge from underground and bring humanity on the brink of extinction. Jaegers are the machines created to combat these monsters. Jaegers are Kaiju-sized robots controlled by two pilots who share a strong bond. One Jaeger pilot loses his brother in a fight with a Jaeger and when he is down on his luck, his former commanding officer recruits him again to battle against the Kaiju in Hong Kong to prevent the apocalypse, or in this case, cancel the apocalypse.<br/><br/>I have a bit of an interesting history with Pacific Rim. I saw it when I first came out and I thought it was the coolest movie ever and I defended it against anyone who called a dumb popcorn flick. It is the film that got me into watching more movies. To kick off the summer, I wanted to watch this movie to see how well it holds up... there will be some spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is an outstanding blockbuster film that delivers everything you could ask for. The characters are wonderful and extremely likable. Raleigh Becket is a charismatic and likable lead who starts out as this energetic and cocky guy who changes into a stoic soldier after he sees his own brother get eaten by a Kaiju. It makes since why he is not the most cheerful person in the world. There are many protagonists in action films that either get on my nerves, that are the chosen one or have the same story, but Raleigh is just a normal person who suffered a tragedy in a battle with a Kaiju and was recruited by Stacker after finding himself down on his luck. He has nothing to lose after finding himself on construction. Speaking of Stacker, this character is one of the most badass in a blockbuster film. He knows how to take charge and he shows passion on not just the Jaegers, but to save the world and protect those he loves. Also, he has the coolest dialogue in the film. Finally, he his character has a great sacrifice. When I saw the movie the first few times, I was a little upset that he died, but now, I see that he got sick, and he wanted to die in a Jaeger. Mako is my favorite character in this film though. She is just an awesome character who is passionate about becoming a Jaeger pilot. At first, she seems to be beating Raleigh in training so it is confusing on why Stacker would not let her be one... until they test it out. This movie does a terrific job showing her weaknesses that she needs to overcome and why Stacker did not let her become a pilot for so long. It shows that while Mako is a badass character who can stand on her own, she is not perfect. The supporting cast is excellent as well. The scientists are comic reliefs, but they are useful for the plot and they are funnier than not. Even the character who is kind of antagonistic towards Raleigh and Mako ends up being respectable by the end of the film. Ron Perlman's character is honestly the weak point when it comes to the characters, but he is still really fun in his role. The characters are just great and even if they are not the deepest, they still get strong development and they all contribute to the plot to stop the Kaiju. The performances are terrific from everyone in this cast with the standouts being Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Charlie Day and Rinko Kikuchi.<br/><br/>But what about the story? It is engaging from start to finish. It is about creatures underground coming to attack the world and how humanity decided to fight back with Jaegers. It even has some themes within the story. Deep down, this is a film about how humanity being down and out having to fight back with every last bit of strength they got. It is a movie that is about teamwork because almost every character in this movie contributes to the goal of stopping the Kaiju from making humanity extinct. In that, the film is very uplifting and even inspiring. Not inspiring in that it makes you want to write movies, but in that it will help you value teamwork more than ever before. The world building is fantastic with showing how Kaiju first attacked and how Jaegers work. They also show why the bond between the two pilots as well as their emotional state is important. The tone is perfect in this film. It has a couple moments of cheesiness, but it takes itself seriously for the most part and it works. The stakes are high and it feels like an actual apocalypse, not just any sort of fun action-packed adventure. Also, there are character moments that are done beautifully without needing exposition dumps. When Mako first enters the Jaeger and her memories cloud her mind, it shows her backstory beautifully with beautiful visual storytelling. There is no dialogue, everything you need to know about Mako's fears and even her relationship with Stacker are shown beautifully in those very emotional scenes with her as a child. It scenes like these that help make the characters so much more likable and by the time the battles role around, you root for them to win. I disagree with people who say that this movie lacks substance with its story, because I think it is definitely there. The story is engaging, even when the humans are the focus.<br/><br/>But of course, I cannot talk about Pacific Rim without talking about the action scenes and visuals. They still look incredible! They have not aged a day and there are films that have much bigger budgets than this does that do not look nearly as good. The Jaegers look realistic and they are huge and scale. Not only that, but they feel big with their movement. They have weight. It feels about as realistic as it can get with a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. The Kaiju designs terrific as well as they mostly have unique designs and they are absolutely terrifying. I love that there are different categories to classify them. The CGI is perfect for both the Jaegers and the Kaiju. Honestly, I thought the Jaegers looked real when I first saw them. The set designs are grand and the scale is huge. The cinematography is breathtaking regardless of whether the focus is on the battle scenes or the training scenes. You can tell how much love Director Guillermo del Toro put into this film with his direction. He had so much passion for this film and it shows every second of the runtime. The action scenes are where this film truly shines. There is not a set piece in this film that is boring or badly shot in this film. The set pieces are pure fun and they let you see the impact that every punch makes and the destruction that comes as a result looks insane. They are beautifully shot and it is easy to tell what is happening. One of the best things about the action though is how rough the Jaegers have it. They get destroyed by the Kaiju often they do not have it easy at all. It makes it very satisfying to see how they win. The Hong Kong set piece is quite possibly my favorite action scene of all time. The scale of the giants, the neon colors with the rain, the Kaiju popping up out of nowhere from a building for a surprise attack, the Kaiju flying Gipsy Danger high in the sky, the destruction of the city and the constant back and forth between the Jaeger and the Kaiju. It is freaking brilliant and it is never dull for even a second. The climax is also under appreciated. It is visually stunning and colorful, the stakes are raised, the odds keep getting stacked for the heroes and it is an emotional ride. It is just a feast for the eyes. On a technical and production level, Pacific Rim has some of the best visuals and action scenes of any blockbuster film period. Also, the musical score by Ramin Djawadi is one of the best scores I have heard in an action movie. The main theme in this film is just amazing!<br/><br/>Although this film is amazing, I do have a couple of minor issues. There are a couple of lines of dialogue that are kind of cringeworthy, particularly some of the humor. Like I said, Ron Perlman's character is the only character that I am not crazy about. However, his end credit scene is hilarious. Finally, I wish we got to see a little bit more from the other Jaegers. Other than that, I have no big problems with this movie.<br/><br/>Every time I watch Pacific Rim, I adore it more and more. I know this review may indicate bias, but I genuinely think that this one of the best blockbuster films of the last decade. It is pure blissful fun from start to finish. I think it is a bit underrated even. I cannot recommend it enough and when you watch, make sure you watch on your biggest TV! This was one of my favorite films when I first saw it and it stays as one of my favorite films.<br/><br/>The sequel on the other hand..."

","The premise of the movie is fairly simple; giant monsters fight giant robots. Yet this concept is used to its full potential in Pacific Rim. The vfx are absolutely stunning, and the camerawork is used to show just how massive these fights are. What the sequel missed was the action; the slow movement of the Jaegers grounds the fights and makes them realistic. The characters are rather forgettable, but they are not the focus of the movie: the giant robot fights are. They didn't need to put so much work into this movie, but they did. It's a ridiculous concept, but executed brilliantly to produce an amazing film."
"hbswan","9","1","1","3 April 2019"," An ultra-refreshing blockbuster
","""...to read too deeply into a movie like Pacific Rim risks losing sight of what makes it great. Whatever subtle critiques del Toro may make about the modern action blockbuster, he understands the simple principle that truly makes the genre work. It has to do with the above phrase: ""just because."" As I mentioned, studios today seem to need their blockbusters to mean something (or at least, pretend to mean something, which is usually as far as they get), but a fundamental part of the appeal of the film medium has always been its ability to show us sights or feats that are impossible in the real world, for no other reason than to provoke in us that wonderful reaction of gleeful amazement. Practically as soon as film was invented, a French stage magician named Georges Méliès was using rudimentary special effects and editing tricks to wow his viewers. His films had plots, but as in a magic show, the primary goal was to astound. Similarly, the great silent-era comedian Buster Keaton became famous for his remarkable stunts, many of which would have killed him had he screwed them up. His film The General was already hilarious; was that death-defying stunt with the railroad ties really necessary? No, it wasn't, but he did it anyway, because it's awesome."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","1","1","8 March 2019"," A first giant step into potential future anime adaptations.
","When I first saw the trailer for this film, I became really excited. One of the staples of anime is the ""giant robot"" subgenre, of which Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are certainly the classics. And while Pacific Rim (2013) wasn't an adaptation of an anime, it got my hopes up that it could be done well enough that we could see live action versions of these aforementioned anime. After all, adaptations to live-action from anything animated tend to be very difficult, so this would be a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>I do have to say that this movie delivered what it promised. Something like a mix between Godzilla (1999) and Real Steel (2011), the premise was a little bit closer to Independence Day (1996) than I initially thought it would be. The visuals were stunning and the fight sequences were both immense and intense, never letting up with the action as the world's options for survival quickly dwindled down to practically nothing. So, the question of whether or not this could lead the way to other ""giant robot"" films still stands, but I think it did a good job of introduction. After all, the Mechanical Engineer in me really wants to see more ""giant robot"" films.<br/><br/>Always the master of his visual craft, Guillermo del Toro delivered the same type of spectacle that we've come to expect from such films as Hellboy (2004) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Of course, the perk of Pacific Rim was a few of the ""lighter"" characters, like Ron Perlman's Hannibal Chau (which, given that this is a del Toro film, I practically expected Perlman to be in it) and Charlie Day's Dr. Newton Geiszler. I also felt that the multi-cultural element of this film was really well presented, along with its strong female sub-protagonist.<br/><br/>A first giant step into potential future anime adaptations, I give Pacific Rim 4.0 stars out of 5."

Yes, there are what you could call ""giant robots"" in play, but here they are piloted by people. And the premise of a neural interface between two people and a machine is definitely new.

"mightymothra","9","1","1","29 April 2018"," Ballistic macho bravado (with none of the macho baggage)
","Pacific Rim is a wonderfully straightforward mecha flick with a surprisingly well-realized universe. Del Toro goes way beyond the expected in creating unique, lived-in, awesome locations that could only exist in Pacific Rim's goofy universe. Entire blocks of city were build on hydrolics, within hangers, to give thundering kaiju monsters the heft and vibrational implact they deserve. It makes all the difference to see puddles of water rippling with each stomp, and see buildings shaking.<br/><br/>Beyond the sheer craftsman, I adore how fully this movie embraces its macho bravado. The music is all guitar riffs and swelling fist pumping anthems, the fights scenes are chalk-full of pilots barking orders and fun one-lines. the mechs are these delightfully ugly hunks-a-junks, all pistons and metal plates and dangling wires. It absolutely rules. The cockpits are another thing Del Toro had build in real life, on hydralic pistons, so that the actors could get tossed around and doused with water. Again, it makes all the difference. This movie invites you to enjoy some big dumb apes wail on space dinosaurs with rocket fists. It embraces the absurdity of their universe and goes whole hogg with it.<br/><br/>I also particularly love how, at no point in this movie, does it celebrate what you'd expect from a macho flick - this isn't all about the nobility of men sacrificing themselves to protect women, or about mocking men for emoting or showing weakness. The cast is littered with strong people in desperate situations, trying help each other out and tap into inner motivation, rather than ""toughen each other up"" with repressive garbage. Characters are shown being weak, being scared, and ultimately, overcoming it all to become who they want. It's a simple message, but lordy am I glad to see it dodge all the pitfalls you'd normally see in a flick like this.<br/><br/>All actors give frankly wonderful performances. I could go into that more, but Perlman, Kikuchi, Eldba, and Day stick out to me as being particularly great. Everyone treats this ridiculous universe with absolute conviction, and it really sells it.<br/><br/>Only negatives I can really point out are the fact that a lot of the battles are in pouring rain, which eh, is not my favorite thing. Also, Cherno Alpha and Crimson Typhoon don't get nearly as much screen time as we all desperately wanted. Maybe they hit that budget wall.<br/><br/>So yeah, absolutely, whole-hearted recommended. This movie is a joy."

Pacing and exposition are occasionally on rapid fire, going from line the next line to the next without really understanding or setting stone what was just explained seconds ago.

","With Pacific Rim Uprising about to be released I felt compelled to watch its predecessor if I'm going to watch the Uprising. <br/><br/>Pacific Rim reminds me a lot of Robotech, a cartoon I used to watch a bit as a kid. At its core, Pacific Rim is an alien invasion movie not too unlike Independence Day. Earth is being serially attacked by these humongous creatures from another dimension coined Kaiju (which is Japanese for Monster). The world forces pooled their resources to create machinery to combat these Kaiju and they coined these mega machines Jaegers (German for giant). The Jaegers, operated by human pilots, dutifully protect the planet until the Kaiju become too much to handle. That's when they need real heroes.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the action this movie would be a total waste because the story and the dialog is extremely unimaginative. The script and the acting even is sophomoric and has no real depth. Fortunately they had extra cool robots to take our attention away from the story. But even the action got to be overdone. It became destruction porn. Large cities being easily ripped apart by giant aliens and their pursuers--that gets old. How many movies with mega-beings or super-beings are going to lay waste to cities? I can only stand to see so many buildings destroyed before it all looks the same.<br/><br/>The robots were nice, the creatures were nice but everything else was mediocre at best; the characters, the drama, the acting.

","Humans must do battle with massive monsters known as Kaiju when a ""breach"" between dimensions opens deep within the ocean. To do this, the people of the world unite to create equally colossal fighting machines dubbed Jaegers (the German word for ""hunter""). In order to successfully operate a Jaeger, a bond, or ""Drift"", must exist between two pilots, a bond that is mental and spiritual as well as physical. The fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who will go into battle with an eager to please rookie (Rinko Kikuchi) at his side.<br/><br/>Here, acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro attempts to play in the same sort of sandbox popularized by movies like ""Independence Day"". Overall, it's more of a visual effects showcase than it is anything else, with a thin story and an over emphasis on spectacle. It comes off like a video game adaptation much of the time, with not too many human moments along the way. Granted, the movie is pleasing to look at sometimes, with a virtual candy store of futuristic images. The Jaegers are also imaginatively designed (at least, their interiors are), although the Kaiju are not particularly impressive.<br/><br/>As could be expected, this is not the thing you want to watch if you're looking for truly great acting. Too many of the characters and performances are annoying, although Idris Elba, as Beckets' sombre commanding officer, has a typically solid presence. Hunnam is an underwhelming hero, with no real charisma at his disposal. Ron Perlman, whose working relationship with del Toro dates back to 1992 and the film ""Cronos"", hams his way through a brief role as a sleazebag who deals in Kaiju body parts on the black market. The true saving grace is the cute and appealing Kikuchi.<br/><br/>Del Toro does his able best to keep his audience from being bored, but without the desire to consistently root for the heroes, it's hard to care a great deal for many of the characters here.<br/><br/>Still, if you just want a gung ho popcorn flick, and aren't looking for substance, ""Pacific Rim"" is passable entertainment.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","1","1","13 June 2016"," High in spectacle, production value and style, a little lacking however in the substance and depth
","Wasn't sure whether to check out 'Pacific Rim'. Reviews were mixed, and those who disliked it (some of vehement) were particularly vocal.<br/><br/>This said, being someone who has found much to like about some of Guillermo Del Toro's previous films, especially the brilliant 'Pan's Labyrinth' and who cannot go wrong with actors like Idris Elba and Ron Perlman in the cast, I watched it anyway. Admittedly there are flaws here and they are quite large, but at the same time 'Pacific Rim' also does a good deal right.<br/><br/>Starting with what 'Pacific Rim' excelled with, it is an incredible-looking film. The cinematography is immaculate, the editing slick, the set/production design audacious and with a suitable amount of grit, but the star visually is the special effects on the robots, which are mind-blowing and some of the best in recent memory. The action and spectacle is exhilarating stuff and keeps one glued to the edge of their seat, they're big and over-the-top but that was what the film was going for and it succeeds wonderfully. The music score fits very well and has several energetic and haunting moments, though occasionally some intrusive ones.<br/><br/>Del Toro does a fine job directing in the action and succeeds in maintaining the silly fun that the film was aiming for (being apparently a homage to the old Godzillas). The film does know what it's trying to be, often has some efficient pacing and target audience is never questioned, which puts it above a fair few similar blockbusters. Not all the acting is great, but there are good performances from a commanding and coolly macho Idris Elba, a expressively understated Rinko Kikuchi and an always reliable if underused Ron Perlman.<br/><br/>Charlie Hunnam is rather bland though in the lead, while of the failure that is the comedy double act of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman Charlie Day in particular is incredibly irritating and there are some very off Australian accents (especially from Robert Kazinsky, which keeps coming and going, often speaking in his own accent). 'Pacific Rim' also has some cringe-worthy and vomit-inducingly inane dialogue and paper thin stereotypical characterisation where not much is done to develop the characters and make one properly care for them. Unfortunately, while this reviewer is not afraid to admit that she had a fun time watching the film the story does get bogged down in the non-action scenes in derivative macho drama and over-silliness, the main culprit as aforementioned being the unfunny comedy double act, and the pacing sometimes loses tightness.<br/><br/>All in all, kind of a mixed view on this one. Fun and very well made, but not immune to flaws. 6/10 Bethany Cox All in all,"

","This was big, loud and occasionally entertaining while dazzling with huge, crazy battle scenes. A visual spectacle in that regard but style more than substance.

Nobody else takes their shirt off in the movie. I also wondered what the point was of having a stick fight training scene other than well, yum. It serves no purpose for operating the giant robots.<br/><br/>Hunnam's voice-over establishes the world this movie takes place in and does a great job in conveying the scope of a film. The story follows a burned out pilot and an inexperienced rookie who are forced to work together piloting massive human controlled robots to save the world from giant monsters that have risen from the sea.<br/><br/>I can see that there would be a definite audience for this type of movie as it looks like 'Transformers', 'Ironman', 'Battleship' etc, where the story is sort of inconsequential as its all about the huge special effects and CGI.

","Two hours and eleven minutes, that's way too long for what could have been a very fun, action-packed superheros vs. monsters flick. Well, maybe there's no Superman or such here, but 'Son of Anarchy' Hunnam and 'Kumiko' Kikuchi form a pair that comes close to the likes, especially when they 'suit up'. The premise, and a lot of other details, may be far from believable, but this is sci-fi of the imaginative kind.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro did some wonderful things in the past, and he tried to keep things interesting here, but a lot of the machismo and romance and such silliness is simply clichéd and boring. And with a film this long, there's no excuse to just cut that out, so I'm getting the feeling that the big studios let del Toro make this, if he would agree to cram in the ingredients for a blockbuster.<br/><br/>The biggest fun of 'Pacific rim' consists mostly of the terrific action scenes, and there is no shortage of that, even if I found the final part (under water) to be a little disappointing. Some humour was reasonably on point as well, like with the two professors and Hannibal Chau.<br/><br/>Too much rubbish in between, though, as said before, so 6 out of 10 seems just about right."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","1","1","21 December 2015"," Starts solid, but completely loses it
","""Pacific Rim"" was one of the summer blockbusters from two years ago. This also is shown by the cast that really lacks superstars. At least back then, Idris Elba was not where he is today and Rinko Kikuchi's Oscar-nominated turn in ""Babel"" was mostly forgotten. Plus Charlie Hunnam is really not a particularly gifted actor. Then again, he does not need to be to make this one work, at least for the first 45 minutes, during which it is a solid science fiction film. It is about a futuristic world (though not too much ahead of us), in which alien creatures emerge from the sea and wreak havoc. As a consequence, humankind has taken measures to oppose this great danger, namely by building gigantic robots that go against the monsters. A touch of ""Transformers"" is undeniable.<br/><br/>I quite like del Toro's ""Hellboy"" movies, so this was particularly disappointing for me here. The reason is that after the first 45 minutes I mentioned, it is all special effects and every bit of interesting story they worked on before that gets completely thrown under the bus. What a shame. It looked like a perfectly solid movie early on and I am saying that as somebody who isn't even big on science fiction films. Kikuchi had a couple solid moments, but in the end, it did not work either because of how underwritten her character was. She gets pushed into a love interest plot for Hunnam's character and they sacrificed everything about her this way. Elba was completely wasted as well. He has such great talent, but the character had absolutely no shades or really interesting scenes. Oh yeah, and finally Charlie Day from ""Always Sunny"". He was certainly included for the laughs, but his character was absolutely never funny. He was basically the only one who was unbearable already in the first half hour.<br/><br/>As a whole, this was quite a bummer. I really did not expect it to go south that quickly and for almost 1.5 hours basically. Totally style over substance. My comments make it obvious I guess that I thought this film was way too long. It ran for over 2 hours and 10 minutes and they easily could have kept it at 90 minutes without losing a lot of substance. The alien creatures became less and less interesting too the longer the film went on. It all turned into a stereotypical uninteresting mess and I don't recommend the watch. Thumbs down."

","Pacific Rim (2:11, PG-13, Imax, 3-D) — 2 — SF, biggie, original, OSIT chauvinists<br/><br/>Clocking in at 2:11, the exact same running length as Iron Man 3 (and also with the same PG- 13 rating), Pacific Rim manages about 10% of the personality and intellectual content, traded off for about 400% of the death, destruction, general smashing, and noise.<br/><br/>It's a mash-up of the rubber-suited Godzillas (now rendered in 3-D by state-of-the-art computers to no greater degree of credibility) and the incredibly noisy, frenetic, jumble-cut train wrecks of the Transformers series. What appear to be people walk thru several of the scenes, generally shouting at or speaking severely to each other in intense tones — except for the wild-eyed, agitated jargon-slinging of the last 2 scientists on Earth that you'd want entrusted with the preservation of civilization (who, of course, are exactly that).<br/><br/>Much of the dialog is muddled and only semi-intelligible, except for some nice, crisp subtitles on the screen when the only female for 100 klicks in any direction, Mako Mori (played by the charming Rimko Kikuchi, the only person in the entire movie who ever smiles), gets off a few lines of ritual self-deprecation and submissiveness. Otherwise it's a testosterone-laden gonad flaunting to see who owns the fire hydrant.<br/><br/>Mori and ostensible hero Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) are co-pilots of Gypsy Danger, the last remaining Mark 3 model jaeger (German for ""fighter""), which is a truly gargantuan robotic fighting machine that's so complicated it requires 2 synced-up human brains (said to be ""in the drift"" when linked) to control it properly. The Mark 3 is recommissioned after all the newer models are rendered useless when the invading kaiju (Japanese for ""giant beasts""), arriving thru a trans-dimensional rift on the Pacific floor, deploy electrical zappers to short out all the digital electronics. ""But the Mark 3 is analog"", exclaims Becket, as he volunteers to take it out to battle a pair of kaiju who emerged in only the last couple of hours to threaten Hong Kong (after earlier lone monster warriors had wreaked havoc on San Francisco, Manila, and either Cabo or Kabul — couldn't tell from the garbly soundtrack).<br/><br/>The human-seeming characters have tried in the past to nuke the rift in the ocean floor and so seal it off from further kaiju incursions, but they've had trouble getting past some obstacle whose name and nature are fleetingly alluded to and thereafter ignored. This time, tho, they have the advantage of some work-around that one of the scientists discovered when doing a jaeger-pilot-style mind-meld with what's left of the brain of an earlier kaiju.<br/><br/>The time it took you to read the above plot description is about as much as what the movie spent on it. Yet Travis Beacham will still collect a check for what is honorarily known as a ""screenplay"". Fully 80% of the film is just whirling, thudding, smashing, bashing fight scenes, which move so fast and in such close-up (also generally in darkness and lots of splashing water, since this is a surf movie of a sort) that you can't tell who's who or who's doing what to which.<br/><br/>I saw it in Imax (a good size screen for the spectacle that director Guillermo Del Toro is obviously trying to create), 3-D (originally shot as such for the CGI scenes but post-converted for the minority of the film that pretends to pay attention to people), and 20,000 watts of surround sound (which blessedly weren't quite as deafening as the literally painful Transformers 2). The talents of Ramin Djawadi, who wrote the haunting, evocative theme song to HBO's Game of Thrones, are here wasted on what I'm sure he was instructed to render as pompous bombast, which plays relentlessly under almost every scene.<br/><br/>There's a welcome cameo appearance by Ron Perlman as a larger-than-life underworld figure who's discovered that the market for powdered rhino horn or tiger penis pales in comparison to what flaccid Asian men are apparently willing to pay on the black market for reprocessed kaiju.<br/><br/>You know that Del Toro is going to max out the visuals, and he doesn't disappoint in that regard, which is one of the few things keeping this regrettable pile of brainless, pointless, overwrot violence from sinking all the way down that rift in the Pacific trenches to a rating of 1."

This was by far the worst movie I have ever watched. I see some users praising the storyline. What storyline? Sublime? Majestic? You got to be kidding me, my teenagers walked out 15 minutes into the movie as did others. We should have done the same. There was no storyline. I cannot even remember what this stupid movie was about. And the acting, boy where do I start. Mediocre!!! Made the story more unbelievable than is already was. Made me cringe.

"CSHaviland","7","6","15","14 July 2013"," Sappiness dragged down an otherwise cool concept
","Ever since the original Gojira in 1954, a serious movie about a giant monster tearing down our civilized world, I've been hungry for an epic movie with the same treatment.<br/><br/>The wait goes on. And the reason is because the subject matter is rarely taken seriously. In fact movies of this ilk are intentionally goofy or tongue-in-cheek, and Pacific Rim is well within that range. It's as if the storytellers feel that there is no way to treat the subject matter in a serious way. After all, it's ridiculous to have giant monsters rise out of the sea and knock down buildings, right? So why not make movies about it that are just as ridiculous?<br/><br/>Really bad thinking.<br/><br/>All of the Godzilla movies made by Toho since the 1954 movie were dumbed down, made for kids. The Roland Emmerich Godzilla in 1998 was full of ham. Cloverfield was serious, but the found-footage hyper-POV format killed the epic, global flavor that I wanted.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for Pacific Rim, but I was very disappointed. The scientists really killed it. They were so ridiculous I was embarrassed every time they had a scene.<br/><br/>Also, Pacific Rim is as much about giant fighting robots as about the giant monsters. The movie began by summarizing an entire history wherein these creatures attacked us, with a few glimpses of them, and jumped forward to begin our story when we already were at war with them using giant robots. It rubs me the wrong way to tell stories in this manner, but I keep an open mind on a case-by-case basis. District 9 used that format, wherein it started long after the aliens have already arrived, rather than chronicling the arrival itself. But I was fine with it. But in Pacific Rim I felt like I was watching a sequel to a movie that was never made.<br/><br/>The battles between robot and monster were very hard to see. There was always darkness, pouring rain, splashing ocean water... I felt like I rarely got a good view of the monsters.<br/><br/>But all of that I would have forgiven if they had expunged it of sappy scientists acting like cocaine addicts and spouting things that made no sense.<br/><br/>I look forward to Gareth Edwards' Godzilla treatment next year to see if he finally breaks the trend."
"drjgardner","6","6","15","13 July 2013"," Great Special Effects But Little Else
","The problem with special effects films is that the special effects tend to dominate the story and the character development, but at the end of the day, it is story and character which make a film memorable. ""Pacific Rim"" is a classic case – great special effects overshadow a poorly developed story line and even weaker characters. One of the core problems in the film is that the main actor, Charlie Hunnam, who does such a great job on the TV series ""Sons of Anarchy"", just doesn't translate well to the big screen. It's not an uncommon problem (think David Caruso). His co-star, Rinko Kikuchi, seems completely lost, and most of the other characters don't have enough screen time for us to care one way or the other. Idris Elba, who usually turns in a good performance, can barely be understood, and Max Martini (""The Unit"", ""Redbelt""), another fine actor, seems to be sleepwalking.<br/><br/>The comic relief, provided by Charlie Day, Ron Perlman, and Burn Gorman, are more ludicrous than funny.<br/><br/>OTOH, the film does have some really impressive special effects, except for the ending, which appears to be shot in the pool of Director Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro directed the ""Hell boy"" (2004, 2008) films, which probably accounts for Ron Perlman's brief cameo. His best work has been ""Pam's Labyrinth"" (2006) which wasn't exactly an action adventure film, and his penchant for sci-fi and insect-like creatures can be seen as far back as ""Mimic"" (1997) which isn't remembered as a classic. Nonetheless he does a good job with the special effect sequences and they will keep you on the edge of the seat."

","First of all, I kept a high expectation on this movie. Every time I saw the trailers/behind-the-scene during the past couple months I was hoping July 12 would come earlier. <br/><br/>Now let's talk about the pros. The visual effects are absolutely first- class, as well as the sound mixing. I also enjoy the cool customs (armor/helmet) of the movie. Every guy dreams arming with it and fighting against giant monsters! Fighting scenes are also great. <br/><br/>Enough good words. I want to talk about what makes me uncomfortable with this movie. Warnings again: spoilers. <br/><br/>The story line starts in a really good way. Raleigh (Charlie) lost his brother in a fight and also lost his confidence to be a pilot. I was hoping that the story will tell how he overcomes this history after spending 5 years constructing, and it does - until five seconds later when his new co-pilot, Mako (Rinko), has more fear to overcome. Then it spent another 10 minutes addressing her problems and forgot to mention how Raleigh overcame his for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Later it turns to talk about Stacker(Idris)'s problems and drives our attentions to a brand-new side of the story. What comes between the main storyline is Gottlieb-Newton bromance. However, it addresses the bromance for 5 minutes before returning to the ambiguous relationship between Raleigh and Mako and Stacker's love, care and encouragements to Mako. Other elements, such as Ron's character, father-son relations and meaningless fights (not the giant type), further drive audience's attention away.<br/><br/>I felt extremely discouraging to form a high anticipation about how the story will flow from the plots, but then found out that the director did stress it, but just for a couple minutes before turning to other aspects. Later I was so good at predicting the story, telling myself that well, anyway, the story will just spend another 5 minutes on this or that. The movie has a lot to offer other than visual effects, but it is over-ambitious, trying to include as many elements as possible.<br/><br/>The way the story starts seems to indicate that it wants to talk about Raleigh, but instead it goes more about Stacker. In-between is Miko, which adds to confusions about how she eventually pilots well. <br/><br/>If you think summer blockbusters like this, Star Trek or Iron Man 3, do not even need a storyline, you will absolutely disagree with me. I am not saying that it has to have a wonderful or heart-breaking storyline as drama does, which is also beyond my expectation. What I am saying is that, you give a hint about how the story will go, and you go for it and go deep enough for it. You have a lot to tell, which is great, but focus on those that form the characters. IMAXize and 3Dize the characters you want to create.<br/><br/>North Carolina, U.S."

However, it is almost the complete opposite here. <br/><br/>In Pacific Rim, we have another silly post-apocalypse story, and although the idea of them coming from the sea is good, this storyline has been overused so many times. Most of the action takes place around ten years after the first alien event with the world almost at its end. To fight the sea aliens, Kaijus, humans create giant robots called Jaegers, which are controlled by two humans whose minds are melted together. The film follows pilots Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) as they try to put an end to Kaiju existence. The plot although seems very complicated is actually so simple that the main character explains it to us in about one minute. Although you would think the film just wants to get this out of the way so that they can show us robots fighting monsters, it doesn't and we are treated to about forty-five minutes of plot-thin arguing and confrontation.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch, especially from Brits Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba who are in the two lead roles however Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro's dialogue is incredibly cheesy and includes every clichéd and over-used line in film that you can think of. Ron Perlman, who plays black market dealer Hannibal Chau, is the film's best feature. Although only on screen for little more than a few minutes, he creates a character you can instantly recognise and gives a superb comic touch to his role. <br/><br/>The main attraction is, disappointingly, the film's weakest part. Although it looks like Guillermo del Toro had a blast designing the robots and monsters, the novelty and coolness of them wears off after a few minutes when we still have a whole film full of them. The action scenes themselves, although well set-up, suffer from the same things that Man of Steel's action scenes did. They show little emotion and are so long and dialogue-less that they become meaningless to the viewer. No matter no epic they are, this is a summer blockbuster and you know the good guys are going to win. The action all takes place at night and, although I have nothing against night action scenes, the lighting is poor so you struggle to see what's going on. The noise level these scenes make can be unbearable and you just wish that, at times, you just wish the camera would zoom out so you can get a better look at what's going on.<br/><br/>Although it looks good and has a superb performance from Idris Elba, Pacific Rim desperately needs to work on its narrative."

","From the very first word that forces its way out of Charlie Hunnam's opening narrative you know exactly what's coming. Cheese! Top, grade A Cheese. Now don't get me wrong i am a sucker for cheese, but this takes the biscuit, or more appropriately, the cracker. Every line by every actor is covered in it. I couldn't help but laugh and sometimes even cringe, but does that hinder my ability to sit back and enjoy the movie? Well, a little, yes. I just couldn't focus, and was unable to invest in the characters or the underlying story. If i was lactose intolerant i may have been in trouble.<br/><br/>However the action scenes are riveting, you almost don't want them to stop. But as much as the film is a ""leave your brain at the door"" kind of film, i couldn't help but nitpick (which i hate myself for doing) at several of the scenes which i felt made no sense whatsoever. Misplaced analysing aside it is definitely worth seeing. A great action movie that doesn't take itself seriously. Remember though say CHEESE!!!!"
"GirishGowda","4","4","9","20 October 2013"," Baby Kaiju should have just swallowed this movie instead of swallowing that man.
","When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.<br/><br/>I knew what one could expect from a monsters v/s robots movie, but was very excited to see a popcorn flick directed by Del Toro even after reading middling reviews about it. Well, I drifted to sleep twice while watching the movie and had to go back to see what I missed. Finally realized I could miss nothing since anyone could easily predict every beat of the story since its the most clichéd movie ever. This is a movie that's dedicated to the mechanical aspects of its futuristic technology while forgetting about its narrative core. It could have been a fun ride though, but the movie didn't even try. I just couldn't take the bland and annoying 'acting', the boringly derivative plot line and the lack of even the most basic of intelligence or common sense at display in the movie. I don't even understand how Idris Elba is praised for his acting in one of his TV shows, Luther, if this is the kind of intensity he brings to the table. Simply put, he's terrible here and the rest are nipping at his heels for the Worst Actor Award.<br/><br/>There wasn't any need to portray the world leaders as ignorant morons when the ridiculous 'wall' was their most logically sound plan to run with. But, there needed to be a contrived debacle for our heroes to overcome just like the modern blockbuster handbook dictates and decent character development be damned. There are a couple of positives though. The female lead Rinko Kikuchi, thankfully is not just a love interest and has her own little truly frightening story. Also, I thought that the massive battles were done really well, no matter the inherent logical fallacies. This is a cgi-lover's wet dream come true. What was unbelievable was that this mediocrity (at best) was directed by the master storyteller Guillermo Del Toro, the same man who brought us Pan's Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone and Hellboy. It has a theme of humanity working together to overcome a seemingly impossible alien problem and has shots of a grand scale, but the auteur in Del Toro is hidden and everything feels small and contrived. Unless you haven't seen many monster blockbusters or don't mind wasting a couple of hours, ignore this at all costs. This is just another glorified two-hour long commercial for toys and a push to expand Hollywood's movies in the Asian territory (which worked since Pacific Rim tanked in the US, but was saved by its worldwide collections). If Michael Bay's name was stamped on the same movie instead of Del Toro's, I imagine there would have been even more deserved backlash to the final product. Baby Kaiju should have just swallowed this movie instead of swallowing that man.<br/><br/>4/10"
"loz_zie","3","4","9","7 October 2013"," scifi without logic.
","I'm gonna keep it short and sweet. The acting, is cringeworthy!!! The characters are not likable...the script is bitty, and cheesy. I don't know what the aim was - is it supposed to be spoofy????? It feels like it sometimes.<br/><br/>It looks alright...BUT the main problem I have, is that there are so many holes in the science in it. I'm not a scientist...I just like things to have logic, and be believable. Someone else mentioned in another review about some stuff I'd noticed myself (the pilots would operate remotely - like people do now controlling weaponry, the workings wouldn't be as clunky and mechanical etc etc)...I know that might sound picky, but once holes are shown in films, it ruins the movie experience. Good scifi should always be plausible. If you're not too bothered about that, there is a chance you might like the film.<br/><br/>It's a shame. I like Del Torro's other stuff as well. But here, he's indulged his style over the substance of the film."
"huwbutts","4","4","9","6 October 2013"," A total disappointment.
","This is a B-movie. As much as I, you, and everyone want to like this film and think of it as a 'classy' action flick due to Del Toro being at the helm, we have all been deceived.<br/><br/>Here we go: Acting: awful; no character development, no emoting from any of the characters. The best performance was by the little Chinese girl. Elba, as much as it pains me to say this, was either terrible or terribly miscast.<br/><br/>So many inconsistencies/unbelievable moments, e.g. waiting JUST until it looks like the Jaegers are defeated before whipping out their game-changing weapons. Smart. ""Gypsy's analogue...erm...nuclear...?"" Yes, just say random things, and you still won't convince anyone that what you're saying is even correct in the context of the movie. The decisions the pilots make will leave you scratching your head - maybe everyone's just stupider in the future.<br/><br/>Terrible action sequences. ""Who on earth wants to actually KNOW what is going on in the fight scenes?"" I'm sure Del Toro asked his numerous yes-men. Cluttered CGI + dodgy direction = action-packed sequences that will leave you guessing as to whether or not you're witnessing a giant mech fighting a oversized dino, or just cars crashing into porridge.<br/><br/>Script & pacing are dire. The whole of the second act was pointless and was (just) worse than the action sequences. The dialogue is cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>Uugh. As per usual, I ask the question ""would I have preferred spending 2 hours doing something else?"", and the answer is a resounding YES for this turd of a movie. Hold up, I've just had a scary thought...Transformers 3 was better than this. Yes, it's true. You go and think about that."
"intelearts","3","4","9","3 October 2013"," 551st Review: Again a Great Director Turns to Shouting And Boasting - A Dreadful Waste
","Pacific Rim is noise, color, and clash - but while the CGI takes over at every point, the movie truly fails to be anything other than PowerRangers on steroids, or Transformers in a better class - and if that's your cup of tea then no bad or balanced review is going to put you off and you'll love it.<br/><br/>Honestly, the actors are the best robots here - the lines are flat and mostly delivered in a Marine sergeant style monotone shout that seems to be becoming the hallmark of US action films. Guillermo del Toro is a marvellous director but here he has been tempted to let his imagination be kowtowed to convention - and really this is a 1980s film with 2010s special effects.<br/><br/>Who buys that we will all have advanced so much in 5 years? That aside, Pacific Rim is simply frustrating - a cacophony of loud noise, big fights, pseudo-emotional scenes that leave us hoping the monsters win if it puts out of our misery. <br/><br/>I cannot deny that the effects are stunning, nor that the overall effect left me stunned and not in a good way - this is not entertainment, it is boasting - and Del Toro was never Michael Bay - but here the boasting leaves no room for film.<br/><br/>A huge shame."
"colinhawksby","4","4","9","2 October 2013"," soulless and predictable
","Cliché after cliché, followed by more cliché.<br/><br/>The script is terrible. Contrived and predictable it seems to deliberately as cheesy as possible. There is no characterisation, no real drama or plot, just the usual Hollywood sturm und drang.<br/><br/>The actors do their best with what they're given but they can't work miracles. Burn Gorman is a typically clichéd British character, and the only weak link in the cast.<br/><br/>There are numerous plot holes but some really distract from the story. Why don't the Jaeger's use their weapons more? how do the escape pods emerge unscathed from the breach? Did anyone not know which characters were going to die? and the governments of the world were pinning their hopes on a wall?!?!?!?!<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie irked me. Why were we thrown into the movie several years after the first attack?<br/><br/>Not very good..might be worth a rental"
"tadpole-596-918256","6","4","9","12 September 2013"," Might as well be fighting bugs . . .
",". . . as to be contending with giant Bio-robots from a poorly-explained intra-galactic wormhole. What all these directors of post-apocalyptic flicks seem not to realize is there comes a point where our world gets so destroyed that the viewer really stops caring about its fate--unless the characters are truly compelling. The latter was the case with ALIEN, made for $11 million in 1979 with the tag line ""In space, no one can hear you scream,"" plus a cast including Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm, John Hurt (the ELEPHANT MAN himself), Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto. By contrast, the makers of PACIFIC RIM (tag line: ""To fight monsters, we created monsters."") obviously did not spend as high a percentage--compared to ALIEN--of their $190 million budget to hire Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, and Charlie Day, who fail miserably to make us really care about what happens to them--or their world. All of the humanity in PACIFIC RIM would fit in the little finger of the 1999 science fiction cartoon, THE IRON GIANT. As a robot movie, PACIFIC RIM is to last year's ROBOT & FRANK as the 2008 THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is to its 1951 model. Even CLOVERFIELD has more heart than PACIFIC RIM, which made me really miss the charismatic bugs from the original STARSHIP TROOPERS."
"groucho1953","Null","4","9","15 July 2013"," Credit Dedication at end of film
","It was a nice touch of Del Toro to add a dedication at the end of the movie Pacific Rim for the 2 master monster makers RAY HARRYHAUSEN (BEAST FROM THE 20,000 FATHOMS 1953) & INOSHIRO HONDA (GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS 1954)the start of the kaiju movies, It would be much better if you added some picture's from those 2 movies (with studio permission of course) and put them on the DVD or Blu-ray disk as extras when the movie PACIFIC RIM comes out to the public. Many people were not born during the 1950's and have no idea who those 2 people that are called master monster makers are, but are known to all science fiction film buffs."

It was groan worthy with some of the bad acting and clichés and had us watching the time for when this travesty would be ended and we could leave.

It is FILLED with nothing but cheesy one-liners & almost every movie cliché' ever! If you haven't seen it just think of Power Rangers with a bigger budget! All the characters were so typical and annoying, and a lot of the movie didn't even make sense! One second the giant robots are deep underwater then they stand up and the water is only round their ankles! WTF?! The drivers of the main robot are your stereotypical USA Jar-Heads with an attitude, and the Russians & Japanese are so cliché'd too, also they threw a classic nerdy British guy in there as the scientist!

"Gojira1963","10","3","6","6 January 2014"," Excellent and Fun Giant Monster movie!
","First off, if you have been regularly following this blog you will know I just love giant monster movies. My DVD collection is stocked full with many Kaiju movies from every Godzilla movie, Cloverfield, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, War of the Gargantuas, Rodan, and on and on. I waited with anticipation to see Pacific Rim and I was not disappointed! This is a great Kaiju move and will hopefully be seen as a classic of the genre some day.<br/><br/>When the trailer first appeared I was a bit worried and disappointed. I was expecting a different tone to the film. I thought it was going to be more gritty and serious and at first glance it reminded me too much of the Transformers movies. (I do like the first and third Transformers movies). After the disappointment abated and I accepted the lighthearted touch, my anticipation for the movie grew. My reaction surprised me because I do prefer a lighter touch with many movies. I guess it was more about my expectations than my preferences.<br/><br/>In the end one of the things I liked most about the film was the tone it set. More and more I am seeing how important the tone of a film is. Pacific Rim strikes that perfect balance between seriousness and fun. There is very good drama with the characters and yet the monster attacks and battles are handled lightly with a good deal of fun. To operate these giant robots, called Jeagers, the human pilots are joined together via their minds. When one pilot loses his brother he is given the chance to join the Jeager team once more with a new co-pilot and she also has to over come her past to help defeat the Kaiju. There are also a couple of whacky scientists that are often at odds with one another and they too have to unite to help defeat these giant monsters. Ron Perlman as the Kaiju black marketeer even has to help out one of the scientists in the name of the cause.<br/><br/>The special effects are great and one of the benefits of modern CGI is seeing both the Jeagers and the Kaiju in their massive scale, Often in Godzilla films that was not an aspect they was always shown. This was one of the most impressive aspects of the film. Pacific Rim also does a good job in balancing human action with monster action. At its heart Pacific Rim is a story about teamwork and redemption. With interesting characters, great action and special effects and an interesting story Pacific Rim is a great addition to the Kaju genre. It has already received multiple viewings in my home and there will be many more to come."

This could be a short film, the story folds and folds on chilches and doesn't go beyond predictable. I loved the gloomy style and fashion of del Toro's at films like Pan's labyrinth, Hellboy..etc. but it feels like its just one of those annually appearing big film projects which you wont be remembering in the following year. I'd love to see del Toro in more cohesive, and forward thinking sci-fi adaptations. yes all 3d and CGI looks nice and polish and seamlessly.

","I am not sure why some people are praising this movie and saying that this is such a great fun. Now don't get me wrong, I love action movies, that kind of movies I mostly watch. But I still think that action movie should have some kind of soul. This movie totally lacks the soul. Acting is horrible and dialogue is even worse, but it doesn't matter here so much because the movie is most of the time like watching an animated movie. The effects are OK but not that great, you will be noticing all the time that you are actually watching CGI animations. Basically every action sequence you will know in advance that what will happen. And even after the first fight I said to myself why the just won't do that what they then eventually did. This is just stupid and boring action movie. Do yourself a favor and watch Fast and furious instead. Its also stupid but at least fun."

Nothing inspiring or insightful about this $100 million movie and I feel poorer for having sat through it.<br/><br/>It reminded me of the worst of 80s science fiction pieces where you have to suspend belief entirely to enjoy them. The fact is we're not in the 80s anymore and are tuned in to the speed of advances in technology and what is and is not possible. <br/><br/>One question I continually asked myself through this was why not use torpedoes, missiles, drones or chemical warfare?

Something like a miracle. Boring, pure acting, predictable, zero background, a total lie. maybe a ""3"" rating if anyone is willing to watch an unspeakable ""light"" film with super hi tech CG, and nothing more.

","Del Toro's latest tentpole, watched in 3D format on IMAX screen, a substantial SFX Jarger Vs. Kaiju monolith which makes TRANSFORMER franchise pale in comparison. But the feeble storyline and unimaginative character-building drags the film into a scrape of torpor. especially after the seasonal actioners' drumfire (after WHITE HOUSE DOWN 2013, 6/10 and FAST AND FURIOUS 6 2013. 6/10), PACIFIC RIM is the most costly one, and its red-hot accomplishment in the Chinese box office suggests a belated chance to break even its tepid reception in the North American domain, with its Japan opening this coming weekend, an approximate $400,000,000 worldwide turnover may green-light a sequel for its ardent followers. <br/><br/>The 3D effect surely doesn't improve at all thanks to the murky palette of the raining night combat and underwater location, under the 3D monopoly (even more absurd there are 4D version available in theaters) at least in China, we have no access to the plain 2D type, which rumor says its rendition is much better in an IMAX screen. Dedicated to Japanese Tokusatsu films, Del Toro and his crew's reconstruction and invention of genre is groundbreaking, an eye- opener with excellent technical scrupulousness, the bombarding sound effects are overwhelming as well as its awe-inspiring and heroic battle scenes. <br/><br/>There are some hiccups keep bugging me, an obvious one is that why on earth there is no conventional weaponry assistance engaging in the doomsday battle, not even as the cannon fodder; another one is the last moment sword stunt, saving the best for the last may not work here, it is only for practicability, but an ill-considered one. Hunnam doesn't possess enough charisma to carry on the film on his shoulder and his platonic relation with Kikuchi hasn't been dug deep enough to steal the limelight. Other actors are standard equipments, Elba is the commander whose background story desperately needs a prequel. Day is the comic relief and Perlman is the egomaniac laughing-stock. <br/><br/>Del Toro's Hollywood odyssey has been rougher than one had presumed, PACIFIC RIM is a qualified film in the sense of it is an updated product for the genre criterion (let's wait and see how GODZILLA will handle the challenge next year), but it doesn't live up to Del Toro's talent if one familiars with his earlier films, notably his homespun masterpiece PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006, 9/10), where mythology and reality have been miraculously criss-crossed and not only our eyes are being opened, our hearts are also being filled with passion and vibration."

"MBunge","Null","5","13","13 July 2013"," If any filmmaker desperately needed to fail, it's del Toro.
","The greatness of Guillermo del Toro as a filmmaker is his ability to tap into the pure imagination of childhood. The failing of del Toro as a storyteller is that he's not grown up enough to discipline that imagination. He embraces fantastic ideas and marvelous imagery but, left to his own devices, his films falter on simplistic and underdeveloped characters, boring and meandering plots, clichés piled on top of clichés and an unwillingness to get everything to make sense. Like a child, del Toro doesn't notice if he's being repetitive or nonsensical or erratic or if his story isn't going anywhere.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is probably the best looking giant robot vs. giant monster movie ever made. The special effects and fight scenes are remarkable to watch. Outside of those scenes, this film isn't any better and might be a bit worse than the average man-in-suit Godzilla flick from Toho. Frankly, the prologue where del Toro world-builds the setting of this motion picture is more interesting and more dramatically compelling than everything that follows.<br/><br/>After years of Mankind using giant robots to kill giant monsters coming out of a dimensional rift on the ocean floor, a fallen hero is resurrected to help in a final attempt to end the war. A bunch of stockier-than-stock characters are introduced. There's a tired subplot with one of the guys from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Big battles ensue. The good guys win. Granted, most folks are looking for stuff like Pacific Rim to be a combination of Mamet, Shakespeare and Steinbeck, but there's not a moment of alleged drama or comedy here you haven't seen many, many, many times before.<br/><br/>But del Toro can't even manage his clichés right. He spectacularly introduces his main hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, and sets up the character's personal challenge. Then del Toro relegates his hero to bystander while he elevates a series of secondary characters to the fore. That might have been bold if their stories were at all entertaining or original. Those secondary character arcs, however, are arbitrarily manufactured, introduced and mostly left unresolved. This could have been Hunnam's big shot at movie stardom. Instead, you'll barely remember he was in the movie.<br/><br/>By the standards of summer blockbusters, Pacific Rim is unexceptional but okay. Maybe if it bombs, folks will stop letting del Toro run wild and force him to marry his amazing vision to some cold, hard, practical thought."

","I didn't have high expectations for this movie. I was expecting one of those mindless action movies that entertain us by sense of adventure and maybe provide some humor. This movie doesn't provide none of the above. <br/><br/>There are numerous plot holes (I don't even want to waste time enlisting them). Characters appear to have come out of a B rated movie. The entire middle of the film is a failed attempt to give some deeper meaning to really shallow characters who are impossible to connect with. The ending is predictable as you would expect from such a movie. I was surprised that a director such as Del Toro would put so many clichés one after another. I can't let go of the feeling that this movie is filling the market gap by being aimed for Asian audience who I guess enjoys Mech movies more than USA/EU and is ready to overlook so many mistakes.<br/><br/>The only positive thing in this movie would be the special effect but that doesn't surprise me when you consider the budget this movie had. I guess with hundreds of millions of dollars it is easy to get a hand on good CGI.<br/><br/>To conclude this review I would say if you're a Mech fan or just simply enjoy watching giant robots bash monsters with pieces of skyscrapers you might enjoy this movie. If you want to see something that at least attempts to have a decent story, meaningful characters or unique atmosphere (recent Batman/Superman movies) this might not be for you."

","Hang on - am I losing it here? This is a tedious, bombastic and predictable slog to watch. How come the plaudits?<br/><br/>Let's be honest - the acting is wooden. The dialogue is embarrassing. The story is formulaic. The characters barely scrape into the second dimension. The music is intrusive, desperately trying to wring some emotion from scenes that are devoid of them, with characters who the audience has no empathy with. The effects are impressive. But there are films out there with impressive effects that also grip you with their narrative and convince with their performances. Some of them even move you.<br/><br/>Most affecting performance of the film - the little girl playing young Mako. And she's barely in it.<br/><br/>The premise feels like a mish-mash of various sources, blended together into something less than fresh.<br/><br/>The look is rather workaday - there's really nothing you haven't seen here before.

This may be a bit hard for some but being a sci-fi I still expect some element of possibility to be part of the plot, but this has none.<br/><br/>For starters, if we had the ability to build these machines, why the hell would we spend millions and suffer the limiting failure that is the mild melding, without just piloting them remotely or via drone technology?

","Wow... it appears that my opinion stands in stark contrast to the majority opinion. This was not the Guillermo del Toro I remember from Hellboy nor Pan's Labyrinth. This movie was shot (or rendered) like a prototypical 80'ish style action movie. Very bright neon colors, over the top acting/script and a subtitle hilarity. This is not bad per se. It can actually be very well indeed and if 'Pacific Rim' would've been grouped in the ""Comedy"" genre, I would've given this a much higher score. My friend and I were laughing throughout the movie, but not due to intentional puns or jokes, but at the ridiculousness and blatant plot holes.<br/><br/>These are some of the questions I would ask someone responsible: <br/><br/>-Why do Jaegers feel the need to do the ""hit the fist"" gesture with their machines and wrestle and/or have a fist fight with the aliens, when they have sophisticated weaponry?<br/><br/>-If Jaegers are connected with a neural link and can see into each others mind, why do they even need to talk during ""alignment"".<br/><br/>-Why do Jaegers prefer to have a fist fight with an alien instead of using any sort of weapon?<br/><br/>-How can a Jaeger be so out of touch with the machine their piloting that they forget a weapon they have (the sword), which coincidentally slices through alien meat much faster than anything else?<br/><br/>-How are 6 helicopters able to lift these colossal mechs for transportation, when these mechs can use a supertanker as a weapon?<br/><br/>-How was the headquarter able to communicate with the Jaeger pilot through (!) a wormhole / into another dimension, but seem helpless at first when locating the rescue pod back on earth (very end).<br/><br/>... The list goes on and on and on. It felt very incoherent and not thought through.

"neil-476","9","4","10","19 July 2013"," Monsters vs Robots - what's not to like?
","Giant monsters are rising from below the sea, and huge robots driven by pairs of human pilots are constructed in order to fight them. This film - a straightforward blend of Godzilla, Cloverfield, Transformers and Independence Day, with a cheerful disregard for anything approximating the laws of physics - contained a number of elements which made me wrinkle my brow quizzically, and much which I liked a lot. It didn't have anything I outright disliked.<br/><br/>So what made me grimace? One, I thought Idris Elba's character was very badly conceived: an individual in that situation would never blow so hot and cold. Two, the caucasian young men heroes were interchangeable: I couldn't tell one from another. They looked the same and acted the same. Three, in this digital age, I didn't find the vast mechanical linkages in the Jaegers credible - surely there would be some digital body suit? Four, the comedy relief scientists were incredibly annoying.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I very much liked the way this film started as if it were the second in a series, with a recap of the origin movie given as a brief voice-over at the start. I liked Rinko Kikuchi's quiet intensity as Mako, and I loved her flashback sequence with the phenomenal young Mana Ashida as young Mako. And, as successor to the Japanese Godzilla movies of the 50s and 60s wherein men in rubber costumes had slo-mo punch-ups in model cities, the movie has spectacular visual effects in which the giant action is completely credible. The whole thing is done with incredible slickness and modest likability. <br/><br/>So get out the popcorn, put on the 3D specs, and enjoy 2 hours of giant monsters and robots beating the bejeebers out of each other. And you don't need to get your brain involved in the slightest!"

","I saw all the glowing reviews for this, and thought some balance was needed as it seemed everyone was watching a different film from me. Pros: Amazing special effects and action set pieces! Cons: Pretty much everything else.<br/><br/>Now I think its important to explain that I'm not Amercian and not a teenager, and so I don't like cheese on everything, especially my movies. I had no issue with the premise of the film, which was essentially robots V monsters resembling dinosaurs. I had no issue either with the casting, especially seeing as it starred Charlie Day and Idris Elba, two actors I greatly admire. What I did have issue with, after seeing the film was that there was absolutely no originality within the sub plots whatsoever. It hit just about every single cliché that Is contained within this type of film. It was Independence day all over again. I wont give all the examples, there are too many to really mention. Suffice to say, the last cliché though, where Idris Elba explains that because of radiation if he fly's one more time it'll kill him, only to minutes later, suit up because he is a last hope remaining, was too much to bear. And how many times in films, does it happen when a bomb needs to be deployed, that the dispatch button doesn't work at the last minute, so the hero needs to put himself in mortal danger to hit the manual override. Honestly, where is the originality. Oh yeah, don't forget the rousing speech before the last fight scene, you know the Winston Churchill type of garbage that declares ""we are the last hope"". And finally at the point when the war was won, and the heroes were safe, everyone in the command center, started the predictable hugging and cheering to the rousing music. It nearly made me throw up. It looks like all the time was spent on the effects, and the script was thrown together at the last minute. Lazy!!"

","Man builds 200-foot robots to fight gigantic monsters emerging from a rift at the bottom of the ocean.<br/><br/>I think this movie may be good for a 16-year-old or younger boy. Otherwise, the stupidity of the story and weaknesses in the acting take you too much out of the action.<br/><br/>From the trailer, I was waiting to be disappointed by why it takes two people to control one robot. Turns out, the neural connection between the machine and man would overload the mind of one brain. Fine. Here's a better solution: nobody gets in the thing and a team of people operate it remotely. Look, I know the point is the show lots of action, but why start off with this silly contrivance? Sure, it's supposed to set-up for powerful emotions when one robot ""pilot"" gets his partner torn from right next to him, but there could have been better ways to create this situation. It could be pilot, co-pilot. Or navigator and weapons.<br/><br/>Then, are robots really the best way to fight these monsters? They say even bombs and missiles are ineffective, yet some of the robots have missiles and other traditional weapons built as part of their arsenal. Either they are or they're not effective. Make up your mind.<br/><br/>But, I get it. It's all an excuse to watch big robots box big monsters. Fine. But, the fight scenes generally disappoint. Technically the film is fine, but viscerally, I just wasn't there with our heroes during most the battles. There were moments in the Hong Kong fight scene, but even that didn't maintain its occasional high levels of excitement.<br/><br/>And the acting was mediocre and made worse by what I guess was poor directing and a lame script. The only memorable line is when one pilot says to his brother as they're about to do battle, ""Don't get cocky."" That was awesome in ""Star Wars."" Here, it just made me think of how much I'd rather be watching that movie.<br/><br/>The character traits that are supposed to make us care are so shoved in and over the top that it never truly connects to us on an emotional level. Yes, it's sibling pilot teams, and father-son pilot teams. But, just saying they're related and share a bond doesn't make us feel that connection. And so many characters are so cliché and overacted it's as if they're in a B-movie. It is a popcorn flick, but at its budget and pedigree, I expect more from the performances.<br/><br/>Finally, perhaps the most distracting part of the film is its score. The movie's music pretty much consists of one theme six notes long repeated and used throughout the movie. I started cringing each time I heard those same six notes (actually, three notes played forward then backward).<br/><br/>This film makes Michael Bay look like Orson Welles and ""Transformers"" the full-color ""Citizen Kane"" of robot movies."

No matter what character he plays he always seems to be Jax Teller, with a different name and a different haircut or hair color. He is basically a poor mans Christian Bale.<br/><br/>I cant wait for the day Hollywood realize that Pacific Rim (Dumb) and Godzilla (Dumber) based on Japanese anime and japanese movies is not the way to go, when making American movies. Most annoying part: because these movies are based on japanese cartoons and movies, were forced to deal with horrible asian actors to please the asian audience. who in part paid for these movies to be made in America with American actors. Asian actors are annoying, not only is their english inept, but so is their so called acting. This is why they dont make these movies themselves in Japan, because they know their actors suck.<br/><br/>Avoid this.

It's like a bad version of a Michael Bay film(which is really saying something). Like the producers had a mission: to be bigger, better and louder than Bay. The result being that the actors out-overact Bay's actors with the unfortunate disadvantage of not having the acting chops to pull it off. Every scene is strained and over-elaborate, just like in Bay films, but even more so. It veers into farce and ridiculous melodrama, devoid of sentiment and involvement. How anyone can care about any of the characters is beyond me - whatever depth they've been given is quashed with every shouty, fake-teary-eyed confrontation that take up surprisingly and unnecessarily long swathes of the epic running time. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - every film of this nature has the same predictability and cliché- ridden plot structure and character arcs. But Shia Lebeouf is capable of eliciting sympathy and the odd smile and Pirates has Johnny Depp and Armageddon has Bruce Willis shedding a tear. Pacific Rim has a B-list cast who lack charisma and most importantly they lack joy, wit, fun. Transformers had John Turturro and John Malkovich as comic relief instead of two pastiche, pseudo-comedian, cabaret revue 'actors' doing one of those duo acts where no one in the audience is laughing or paying attention except for when it's their turn to throw rotten fruit. The science duo are not just palpitations-inducingly annoying but they also get reels and reels of screen time - managing to be more nauseating than Jar-jar in the process. The main character acts and looks like a cheap version of Channing Tatum or Josh Hartnett and his Japanese side-kick spends the whole movie in tears. Idris Elba and Ron Perlman are the only characters with any kind of gravitas but are sadly lost in a sea of melodramatic absurdity. <br/><br/>Now - obviously this film is all about Giant Robots vs. Giant Aliens so the above should be totally irrelevant. So why spend such an inordinate amount of time developing these rice paper thin characters? I don't care about plot holes and over- long exposition scenes in these kind of films - it's part of it. But if the film decides to have a lengthy story between relatively short mega-action set pieces then give them a worthy script and cast some decent actors. Also, make us excited about finally seeing these beasts and these magnificent machines fighting it out instead of showing us everything in the exposition intro. One of the great aspects of these films is the way the director gets to slowly build towards the mayhem. Here we are in it from the beginning - like it's normal. Massive oversight. And for God's sake don't set the final fight in an environment where the scale of the beasts and robots are rendered entirely irrelevant. Reminded me of Ang Lee's Hulk. Wrong part of the film to play it safe. Look to Avengers and the latest Transformers for how to massively up the ante for the final battle. <br/><br/>I expected Battleship to be terrible but watchable - it was. I expected this to be ridiculous - it was. But not in the way it should have been. It should have been ridiculously fun but instead had us sit through a masterclass in poor scripting and acting with far too little of the thing that was written on the tin."

And effects were pretty good.. Right. Horribly illoginal the whole script after first minutes. Well Transformers fans might be amazed I was just darn bored.<br/><br/>And those clichés were so brainless.

"Sam_Jr","7","3","7","6 October 2013"," The CGI was superb, pity the acting/story was awful!
","I gave this movie 5/10 and that was basically for the CGI which was fantastic, best i've seen for a few years. It's hard to believe the story which was so simplistic and childlike at best was incorporated into a Guillermo Del Toro movie. A man whose imagination and direction are his genius clearly dried up for this release. Basically monsters from another dimension come through to earth and the world creates giant robots called Jaegers to fight them, yes folks that's it! The gaps in between the awesome fight scenes are filled by the most tedious dialogue and acting you could imagine. Charlie Hunnam who is English clearly has only one American Accent and OTT swagger and each scene he is involved in looks straight from Sons of Anarchy. Idris Elba got real plaudits from critics for this despite showing no screen presence or emotion throughout the movie. The most annoying character is Dr Newton (Charlie Day) whose high pitched screech of a voice provides constant ""nails on a chalkboard"" irritation in every scene he appears. It's clear Del Toro and team aimed this character as a crazy/funny genius but this fails miserably and he ruins every scene with his overacting screaming.<br/><br/>Del Toro also had a brainwave that instead of having the English spoken Hansen duo (father and son) talk in their normal English accent for the movie he would have them speaking like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Having saw both actors in other roles they don't speak like that in real life so much so as a Brit i could barely make out what they were saying. All of these problems wrapped around a poor script with no big name actor to carry the movie gave it a limited release 'B' movie feel. Had it not been for the truly awesome CGI, cityscapes and fight scenes popping up now and again this movie would have been a blot on Del Toro's resume. God only knows how they spent $180m on this.<br/><br/>In a sentence, no superstar actor, 'C' class bit part actors managing to overact a poor script/story with the CGI saving it from total embarrassment."

","I would normally write an interesting and compelling review about a new movie that moved me enough to do so, but in complete honesty I must admit; this is actually the worst film I have ever seen. This film will always be the defining example of what happens when a production crew have a ton of money and technical skill, but no creativity or vision.<br/><br/>Ten minutes into this movie, there are already enough plot holes and ridiculous and cheesy moments. The first issue arose when the narrator explained that to stop a threat which was previously dealt with by bomber planes, humans developed crazy technology, spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and trained thousands of people, in as a result, have a really big metal thing that they can hit the aliens in the face with. That's all.<br/><br/>The biggest insult to my intelligence was when they insisted that because the robots are big, humans aren't capable of controlling them alone. It clearly did not occur to the writers of this film that this is simply ridiculous. These robots have the same number of controls and joints as real, modern day robots. The film continues with a never-ending list of nonsensical and dumb plot points with more holes than you can imagine.<br/><br/>Previously, films of such low calibre have been underbudget too, but this atrocious waste of money that is Pacific Rim actually upsets me: those millions of dollars could have gone towards a programme to increase poverty in third world countries, and would still have been better spent."

","This could've been such a much more satisfying movie then it was. This is definitely no Independence Day with Will Smith. I'm almost positive that the studio butchered the original screenplay into creating the awkward romance and forced father son/daughter relationships between the pilots. Those scenes really distracted from the main objective, saving humanity. That really is what this movie is about, humans working together from around the globe to save ourselves from an invasion. With such high stakes on the line the movie focuses a lot on the 6th grade level flirting and dating between Raleigh and Mako. If your going to go there at least have them become romantic like confident military minded adults. Which for being such bad ass pilots and in the elite organization they all acted with little discipline except for the Marshall. The sub plot of creating a mind bridge with the Kaiju also seemed unnecessary.<br/><br/>Pros: Amazing visual effects and action sequences. Cons: Flimsy Characters and weak development."
"rmodule","6","3","7","3 September 2013"," You've most likely seen something very similar
","On the special effects side this film truly deserves a 10/10. Some of the fight/battle scenes are absolutely brilliant and they do make watching the film in a cinema worthwhile. The plot, however, is not that far from what you would expect from watching an episode of Power Rangers. The bad guys are coming; lets morph into some big ass robots and kick their asses. Not a *single* part of the plot surprised me a bit and I can truly say that this has to be one of the most predictable movies I've seen in quite some time.

","Its been a long time since I've seen a bigger disappointment than Pacific Rim, this Avatar wannabe, second rate Japanese Robot parody reject is just simply not worth watching past the first 4 minutes, which I kept missing (until just recently) in part out of pure bad luck. I'm sick of catching the ass end of that bridge scene with that 1st big monster, which is the unfortunate promise unkept in this movie, one of the grandest and richest unrealized promises, I think, in the history of motion pictures, especially when you factor in gems like the War of the Worlds, King Kong and Godzilla franchises, even the Roland Emmerich Godzilla. Del Toro really needs to try another version of this concept and get it right this time, with the big, scary simplicity that bridge scene promised the first time, but this time delivering us a movie worth watching, with some Joy Luck Club heat in the apocalyptic backdrop of those monsters taking over the world, with not one of those stupid assed robots in sight."

","I had great expectations for this movie based primarily on the fact that Guillermo del Toro was in charge. While his influence is obvious in that the visuals and design are impressive, there is nothing new here in terms of the plot or script. Anyone who has seen The Avengers, Cloverfield, Godzilla and Real Steel has basically seen this movie's main ideas on screen already, all of them are combined in Pacific Rim but in this case the whole is a lot less than the sum of this parts. I watched this in IMAX and the visual effects were well suited to the format, however, the destruction of cities and fights with giant robots are not enough to carry the film. Idris Elba does an admirable job with a limited script but the remainder of the characters are as clichéd as they come with the two academics, Gottlieb and Newton, being particularly irritating.<br/><br/>While I give this a score of 4 stars these are for the visual effects and not the jaded, threadbare plot."

"Far-Sky","10","5","15","13 July 2013"," Guillermo del Toro returns with a feast for everyone
","When monstrous, building-sized creatures (dubbed ""kaiju"") hell-bent on destruction begin pouring out of an extra-dimensional fissure at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, humanity bands together to build titanic mechas called jaegers, each controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are linked through a neural bond called ""The Drift."" As the kaiju get stronger and the signs point to an all-out flood of the beasts, the fate of humanity looks bleak, and the surviving jaegers are brought together for one last-ditch attempt at saving the world.<br/><br/>After an agonizingly long five-year wait, filled with some heartbreaking starts and stops (like the almost-weres of 'The Hobbit' and 'At the Mountains of Madness'), Guillermo del Toro has finally returned with his biggest budget and story yet. The Mexican master of fantasy returns to the toybox of his youth, drawing from the kaiju films of old (Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and the like) and anime to create the modern-day monster movie we didn't even know we wanted.<br/><br/>I am a genre man through and through, and del Toro's films are filled with both the intelligence of the best of science fiction, fantasy, and horror and a flawlessly-rendered vision unique to him. His innate knowledge of what makes those outlandish stories truly matter to us is the backbone of his work as a writer and director, and his visual style is one that invokes true wonder.<br/><br/>It's that wonder, that childlike glee that makes 'Pacific Rim' work so well, and well it does work. This is a brawny, massive film made by a true artist and auteur at the top of his game, but while the technicals of this film could have been mounted by any number of working directors, the magic of Guillermo del Toro is that he infuses every film with himself. His love of the material, whatever it may be, shines brightly through every frame. It is this complete sincerity that makes his films such a joy to experience, and even when there are 250-foot behemoths slugging it out on the screen, there's not a trace of the disastrous irony so readily supplied by other blockbusters anywhere to be found.<br/><br/>The cast gamely comes to play, with Idris Elba (TV's 'Luther') as Stacker Pentecost (one of my favorite character names of all time) as the stoic leader of the jaeger program, Charlie Hunnam (TV's 'Sons of Anarchy') as former pilot Raleigh Becket, who suffered a tragic loss and has to be convinced to return to jaeger service, and Oscar-nominated Rinko Kinkuchi ('Babel') as Mako Mori, another life touched by the kaiju and ready to serve up some righteous fury. If these sound like tried-and-true archetypes, it's because they are. This is a grand, epic war film on a bigger scale than anything ever attempted before in that genre, and one of the strokes of genius from del Toro and original writer Travis Beacham is that we instantly identify and identify with the characters on screen. There are so many ideas flying around (monsters, mechas, neural bonding, kaiju culture, and many, many more) that the broadly-drawn characters serve as a perfect anchor for the audience, immediately relatable in their inherent humanity.<br/><br/>It seems that the mission statement of this movie was, in a word, ""texture."" Del Toro delivered a visual feast unlike any other big spectacle films, with his insistence on it not looking like a ""glossy car commercial."" Instead, every frame is filled with rain, snow, scuffs, smoke, debris, and other visual elements that reflect the weight and dimension of these cyclopean combatants. Unlike the ultra-glossy (and emotionally irrelevant) 'Transformers' films, or virtually any other modern big-budget actioner, this universe feels dirty, grungy, and lived-in, like the original 'Star Wars' trilogy.<br/><br/>In fact, dubbing a film ""this generation's 'Star Wars'"" has been overused to the point of robbing the phrase of all meaning. But Pacific Rim feels just like that. It invokes those most elusive of emotions in the modern studio film: wonder, awe, and sheer enjoyment. Do you remember the awe you felt the first time you saw a Star Destroyer creep onto the screen? Discovering a brachiosaurus on Isla Nublar? Laying eyes on the verdant fields of Middle Earth? This film has that. No one builds worlds like del Toro, and here he is, the master, inviting you to play in his sandbox with him. Grab your favorite action figure and hop in."

And what can be more epic than elbow rocket? There is WOW factor every time you watch clashing Kaju and Jaegers . Somehow you will feel perfect mix between power of the Jaeger and the monstrosity of the Kaju. But even powerful high tech mountain of steel and will struggle to stand ground against ferocity of the Kaju attack. This is something which is totally worth it to see it in 3D and on the biggest screen you can find. Some people complain about cliché lines, wants better story or they think it nonsense is according to our scientific knowledge Well common seriously? Star trek is nonsense; star wars, superman, and list go on. What's wrong with story? You want something to think about go watch Driving Miss Daisy, and cliché lines or characters I can find in every movie. I have also find information that this movie apparently is only for people with small brain, well I have studied Physic and I loved it. It is all about entertainment. I have enough of drama and personal problems in normal life and I'm not going to the cinema to watch same stuff I have to face every day of my miserable life I 'm going there because I want see something awesome and I want to be entertained.

","So I love this film, everything about it was awesome but I'm going to split it up into different areas, first I'll talk about the acting, then the story, then the fights and special effects!<br/><br/>Acting: Overall it was good or really good, you have Charliee Hunnam as one of the main character: Raleigh Becket, to me he was like the guy from Tron Legacy but you actually felt for the guy, he had emotion and was believable in his role. Next you have Idris Elba who played Stacker Pentecost,and to me he carried this film, just the way he acted in every scene was brilliant! And the final main character is Mako Mori who is played by Rinko Kikuchi, I don't know her too well be she did a pretty good job in her role, and once again she was believable.<br/><br/>Story: The story is going to be something you seen before minus the giant monsters and robots, A guy worked in a program bent on saving the world, he gets discontinued and then gets put back on the job years later. We've all seen something like that before, but what I thought was cool was the way the monsters come out of a portal in the Pacific Ocean, I've never seen anything like it. Overall the story is good.<br/><br/>Action/Special Effects: So this is probably the main reason you've come to see this movie and man, does it deliver! Every action scene I was on the edge of my seat, with my jaw dropped in amazement! Watching these awesome CGI robots beating the crap out of giant monsters was a joy to watch! The destruction of this film is crazy, robots are punching through buildings, monsters are rushing through cities, destroying bridges and freeways. Every fight scene is awesome, and I like how each of the Jaegers had different weapons. For instance, one had a chainsaw sword, another had, like 4 arms with saw blades on each hand, another had rockets that came out of it's chest and shot missiles. Not to mention the special effects were top notch, everything looked so real! Del Toro really know how to make a good film, if you love his work or just love action films in general, this is definitely a must see!"

"kevinxirau","9","5","15","13 July 2013"," 2,500 tons of pure awesome. Kaiju vs Mecha!
","As a kid growing up, I used to watch Godzilla and other Japanese monsters all the time and it quickly became my passion. I also had some respect for the mecha genre like Gundam, Zoids, etc. While this is not the first time kaiju and mecha class for supremacy (examples being ""Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla"" and ""Envangelion""), it has never been done on this kind of scale. What we have here is essentially a ""love letter"" to those classic films and this is coming from Guillermo del Toro of all people in all his creature mastery. Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you the ultimate clash of the titans. This is Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>Plot: Giant monsters from another dimension called Kaiju (Japanese for monster) are sent through a portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to eradicate all of humanity. As normal weapons prove ineffective against the beasts, the military develops the ultimate weapon, the Jaegars, giant robots driven by two pilots built to go toe-to-toe with their reptilian rivals. While successful at first, more and more Kaijus come in stronger than their predecessors to take down the Jaegars. With options and resources being depleted, it will take a former pilot and his new partner to control a legendary Jaegar as part of a final plan to end this war of the monsters.<br/><br/>I've been waiting to see a film like this on the big screen since ""Godzilla 2000"". First off, I love this world Guillermo has created as a lot is established to breath life into this grand world of monsters and machines. We see how people live in a time like this and how they all see this entire situation from different perspectives. Most of the characters are surprisingly likable, each having their strengths and weaknesses, and the acting isn't half bad (if not over-the-top at times). It's hard to get likable humans in a monster movie and this film does a good job with it as I generally feel for the characters as they develop unique relationships, in particular the main pilots Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori as well as their commander Stacker Pentecost.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film is definitely the Kaijus and the Jaegars and the battles between them and it never disappoints. These are some of the best actions scenes I've seen in a film like this. Like a giant-sized wrestling match, these titans smack each other with random objects, shooting projectiles, and smash through buildings, pretty much beating the living crap out of each other and everything in sight is reduced to rubble. I like how unpredictable the battles are as the film keeps you guessing on what's going to happen next. I also love the designs of both combatants as each of them, Kaiju or Jaegar, has it's own unique design and special abilities (not to mention cool names like Red Cyclone, Leatherback, Gypsy Danger, Otachi, etc.).<br/><br/>Overall, I was blown away by this movie. While the beginning was a little slow, it picks up the pace in the middle and ends with an epic climax. I honestly hope a sequel is made (and believe me they're planning on it) so I can see another titanic showdown between monsters and machines. If you love action, science fiction, Guillermo del Toro, or Japanese monsters, then definitely check this one out because it's worth it."
"Guacamole_Bandit","10","5","15","13 July 2013"," Pacific Rim delivers on everything promised in the trailer and more
","Sure to become the genre-defining first of a slew of giant monster movies set to return to Western theaters (I suppose we do need a break from all the zombies), Pacific Rim fires on all cylinders and moves too fast to let any slip ups slow it down or affect your impression of the final product.<br/><br/>Ramin Djawadi delivers yet another fantastic and iconic score, a job that even famous composers fail to always accomplish, that perfectly complements the epic scope of the film. Yes, there's that overused word: ""epic"" but there is no other word for this film. I was sitting in awe for the entire first act of the film.<br/><br/>Rather than take risks with the plot Del Toro plays it safe and predictable towards the end, perhaps having realized he had a hit on his hands and not wanting to screw it up with needless risks. But as satisfied viewers, we wish he had taken more risks and given us more, more, more as most of the other positive reviews indicate.<br/><br/>The film's credits include appropriate shout outs to the creators of Gundam and Neon Genesis Evangelion and other giant monster fare which paved the way for this film in the way that the genre of cyberpunk paved the way for The Matrix. Though don't get me wrong, The Matrix took all those risks Del Toro didn't and enjoys a much loftier status in cinematic history for it. But Pacific Rim is just as fun and it's a good thing the filmmaker kept that the focus whereas The Matrix did take on a lot of other loftier goals and baggage (quite successfully at that).<br/><br/>This film is meant to be seen on IMAX 3D. It is the best implementation of 3D in film I've ever seen, surpassing Avatar. Think of the epic fight scenes in Man of Steel which were a delight in IMAX 3D. Now imagine the entire film was like that with lots of subtle 3D touches and flair thrown in.<br/><br/>If you want headier sci-fi, Elysium will probably deliver on that front, but I can't imagine any film being more entertaining than this in the foreseeable future."

The effects were realistic, never overworked. I found myself gritting my teeth and squinting my eyes as they fought and cheering them on in my head. I never do that. The whole premise felt new but plausible and the creatures were a perfect blend of otherworldly and unexpected. They actually surprised me more than once. In conclusion, this movie is for everyone.

","Robots vs. Giant Monsters? What could possibly go wrong? How about bad acting, bad pacing, shallow and clichéd characters, and long stretches between action that feel like they're from another movie? Heck, it'll almost feel like you're watching a sequel to an earlier movie. I get that they wanted to put us in the middle of the story to better catch our attention and intrigue, but it would've been nice to see more of the start of the war instead of a summary. Therein lies one of the movie's main problems: it's rushed in some place...and slow in others. The other problem? The characters are paper thing cutouts we've seen before, and better.<br/><br/>This is also displayed very early in when we meet our hero, Raleigh Becket, and his brother. They literally start their day battling a kaiju...and Raleigh's brother is killed. Thing is, we never learn anything about him other than he's the older brother and that's it. There's no reason to be sad when he's killed. Raleigh misses him deeply, but the audience isn't given any reason to miss him at all. Likewise, most of the other ""Jaeger"" pilots are just...there. They don't have any personality and play a ridiculously small role for people piloting giant robots to fight monsters. The ones that do have some personality/play a role are one-note stereotypes we've seen before.<br/><br/>The only other pilot who really stands out is Mako Mori. She's given the most depth & backstory...but it's sadly undermined by Rinko Kikuchi's performance. And wouldn't ya know it, she and Raleigh have a romantic subplot that's dull and fairly intrusive. <br/><br/>Raleigh himself is a boring, clichéd, unlikable hero. He has no personality other than being your standard issue fighting ace who fell from grace, but still has amazing, almost superhuman skills. That's all there is to him and we never really learn any more than that. It doesn't help that Charlie Hunnam is just another action movie star who'd skills seem limited to shouting, scowling, and smirking.<br/><br/>Luckily, there's some good supporting players. Iris Elba gives the movie's best performance as the team leader Commander Pentecost. Ron Pearlman seems to be enjoying himself as (the snazzy dressed) black marketer Hannibal Chau. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman bring some energy & comic relief as a pair of scientists (though they can be kind of annoying)<br/><br/>Thing is, it really could've all turned out better. The Kaiju are massive and bestial and look as fearsome as giant monsters would be if they were real.The Jaegers all have unique designs and abilities to help them standout (even if their pilots don't). The battles between them are fast, brutal and bombastic and are indeed the highlight of the film,especially in some pretty good 3D. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, when there isn't any Kaiju vs. Jaeger action, it's as boring as a movie about cities being destroyed in battles between giant monsters and robots can be..."

","So, I was listening to our local movie critic do his weekly review on the radio on my way to work last week. He was saying that this is the best flick he's seen so far in 2013. This intrigued me. Later that night my son 7 year old came home and said, ""Mom, I heard about some movie called Pacific Rim. Will you take me?"" Figuring it was a sign, we found ourselves at the movie theaters earlier this evening. I took he critics advice and forked over the extra cash for my theater's IMAX/3D version of the flick. Wise choice. A wise choice indeed. This movie comes very close to putting the audience into sensory overload.... Just close enough to still be incredible. Great story line. I like that it deviated from the cliché aliens from outer space. The concept was fresh. And, it was never drawn out. Action-packed for more than 3/4 of the movie. I also liked that they used recognizable, but not over-used actors. No one's celebrity status overshadowed another's. I also liked that the love story was an unlikely couple who weren't running around naked or groping each other every minute of the movie. There were also other characters who had separate story lines going... They added great humor to the action and drama. <br/><br/>All and all a great night out. There really wasn't many swear words at all... So, other than the robot on monster violence... This was a good family flick."
"andy-barbieri","9","4","11","18 July 2013"," Pacific Rim
","SPOILER ALERT: I Loved this! This is what your big summer popcorn blockbusters should be all about!<br/><br/>From the trailers you get the simple premise about this film, ""as a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and a trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse."" Yes, it uses the familiar tropes from various movies ('Independence Day' immediately popped into my head when watching this), and, essentially, what you see is what you get, but don't let that diminish the feeling of fun when watching this film.<br/><br/>I'm sure the so-called 'critics' that have shot down this film, have done so more on the basis of how could a director, that has made 'The Devil's Backbone' or 'Pan's Labyrinth', stoop so low to come up with a movie like this? But this is Guillermo del Toro, and from the vampires of 'Cronos', the ghost story of 'The Devil's Backbone' and to his twisted fairytale 'Pan's Labyrinth', his films come from his passions, and as a loveletter to the Kaiju and mecha films of Japan, 'Pacific Rim' is no different and deserves it's rightful place alongside his other films.<br/><br/>But back to the film, and it really is a simple story, of good old heroism overcoming monstrous adversity and saving the day. The Kaiju and Jaegers are impressive and the fight scenes, although with not quite as much carnage and destruction as 'Man Of Steel', still hit the spot and are the definite highlights of the film. The characters are standard fare for this type of movie; the washed up hero back for redemption, the untested rookie, the stereotypical other pilots, the leader of the crew who used to be one of the pilots (along with the typical inspiring speech before the end), the arrogant pilot who goes up against the hero, the bickering scientists, it's all there and there to be enjoyed. <br/><br/>I loved this film for exactly for what it is, a big dumb roller-coaster blockbuster of a movie, but oh, what a ride it was!"
"skot-21","9","4","11","17 July 2013"," Is Pacific Rim Right For You?
","If you even have to read a review, probably not. If the first trailer didn't give you goose bumps and have you so excited you had to see it as soon as it was released, then it probably isn't for you.<br/><br/>Now that said, I wanted to try and clear some things up, since most of the negative reviews are pretty bogus and misleading. I find the negative reviews fall into 2 categories. People the movie wasn't meant for, or just plan haters.<br/><br/>""It's to hard to see the action"" maybe in 3d, I sat in the 5th row of the non 3d, non Imax showing, running off 2 hours of sleep and ZERO problem making out what was happening. I'm also the only member of my family that doesn't wear glasses.<br/><br/>""There's not enough character development"" Their right, there's not enough character development of the actual stars of the film, the Kaiju and the Jaegers. Oh, they mean humans, well there I'd have to disagree, in my opinion there was just enough... maybe even a little too much. Because I don't care about the people who drive the robots, I care about the robots and the Kaiju. That's why I'm there. It's also important to point out that there's almost an hour was left on the cutting room floor and I'm willing to bet it's all that boring ""character development"" these people must be talking about. Some people mistake ""character development"" and ""love story"" and if that case, they are correct, there is no love story. Thank God! <br/><br/>""It's Too Cliché"" There's a big difference between ""Cliche'"" and ""Homage"", much like ""Literal""and ""Ironic"" cliché is more often then not, misused.<br/><br/>""It's a ripoff of Evangelion"" This comparison really get's me hot under collar, because I'm a long time fan of Evangelion and it shows how little people hating on Rim know about ether. To sum it up, the only way that would be true is if Jaegers were built over top of captured Kaiju. That's not the case, so we'll move along.<br/><br/>""It's Rock'um Sock'um Robots"" Wrong again, that would imply robots fighting robots. This is Robots fighting Monsters. It would also imply that it's only Robots fighting each other and no people, which this movie has way to much of in my opinion, people that is. It could use some more robots socking monsters tho.<br/><br/>""Charlie Day is grading"" I 100% agree, can't stand him! If you like Sunny in Philly, then you'll probably enjoy his contribution.<br/><br/>""It doesn't have big name actors"" Yes it doesn't have mega star actors and that's a good thing IMO. I like the fact that Bruce Willis isn't in it, because every time I see Bruce Willis he's Bruce Willis. If Sam Jackson played the character Stacker Pentecost instead of Idris Elba we would be waiting for him to say ""I'm sick of these MuthaFn' kaiju on my MuthaFn' planet"" or waiting for a kaiju to reach down and eat him while delivering the ""Canceling the Apocalypse"" speech. See where I'm going with this, big name stars would have been a huge detriment both in performance and cost. I had no issue with the casting except Charlie day. Charlie Hunnam was solid and being familiar with his work on Sons of Anarchy I thought he fit the role perfectly.<br/><br/>""It's Racist"" This one makes me scratch my head. Having a very popular or recognizable Japanese actress in a movie about giant monsters that will be opening on screen through out Asia is not racist. Having actors form other countries in a movie that is about the world coming together to fight off an extinction level threat is not racist, it's refreshing and maybe even realistic. I'm an American and American's ain't smart enough to go see Pacific Rim rather then grown-ups 2, so why should I believe for one second they could fight off this threat by themselves? The answer is, they couldn't and why should they, this is for the species folks, the whole world has a steak in this.<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on, but I'll stop. I think if you've read this far, you get the idea. If you like giant monsters fighting giant robots, it's worth the regular ticket price just to see those scenes on the big screen, personally I wouldn't pay extra for IMAX or 3D tho. <br/><br/>If your looking for a love story, this movie isn't for you. If you want to watch a male and female character sitting in a coffee shop for 2 hours talking about life, this movie isn't for you. If your over the age of 15 and think Transformers is great, then this movie defiantly isn't for you. <br/><br/>So if this doesn't seem like your cup of tea, then go see something else, don't see it bad mouth it, it's not like there isn't plenty of other options to check out at theaters."
"khanbaliq2","9","4","11","16 July 2013"," A big, beautiful and sophisticated science fiction treat.
","Guillermo del Toro gets it right with Pacific Rim, an action-packed science fiction film that seems familiar but, at the same time, original. This is a story about gigantic humanoid mecha (Jaegers) fighting colossal monsters (Kaiju). If you watch anime you may know that the plot is similar to a number of anime. The film, however, is a tribute to older anime and not a rip-off. Yes, it successfully captures the appeal, weirdness and style of giant robot anime in live-action form. In short, this is a film that many Japanese filmmakers wish they could make. And with the addition of excellent visual effects and a suitable cast Pacific Rim reaches heights that many anime viewers and nerds always wanted to see. Some reviewers compared Pacific Rim to Godzilla films but once you watch it it's clear that giant robot anime was the real inspiration, one of the most important being Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) by director Hideaki Anno. The Kaiju are somewhat similar to the angels in Evangelion in their fighting abilities, size and the frequency of their appearance. Rinko Kikuchi's character Mako Mori is very much like Rei Ayanami; her behavior, her relationship with Raleigh Becket, her backstory, and of course her hair with blue highlights. The Jaegers too resemble the Evas. Then there's the action, which is tense and exciting and backed up with a good soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi. But there's no action overkill because del Toro also spent enough time on developing the characters. Charlie Hunnam does a fine job as the protagonist. Idris Elba and Charlie Day shine in their roles. When talking about Elba's character Stacker Pentecost del Toro said ""he's doing penance for all humanity... Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes."" And, unlike many recent action blockbusters, Pacific Rim doesn't involve the American military. Del Toro is a self-described pacifist so he avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. In conclusion, Pacific Rim is the best blockbuster of this summer. I doubt that any other upcoming film will be better. It's a real success. Thankfully Guillermo del Toro was chosen to direct this $190 million project. It's some proof that once in a while Hollywood studios do spend money wisely. I easily recommend it."
"jpoore5","9","4","11","16 July 2013"," Made my IMDb account just to review this
","What a movie! I had already planned to see it, and after seeing the largely favorable reviews from IMDb I was very excited to get to watch it. Definitely the best movie I have seen so far this summer, and probably the best one I've seen in 2013. (I know Django Unchained came out in 2012, but I saw it a second time in theaters in 2013.) Regardless, fantastic movie. I felt just the introduction to the movie with the battle with Kaiju off the Alaskan Coast was movie-ending battle good, and that was just the beginning! The movie's plot was good but not great, but really I wasn't there to see amazing plot. Taking it for a straight action movie this was possibly the best one I've seen. Enough Kaiju battles to keep me completely interested through the entire movie, and the bright spots of the plot were able to take up time in between Kaiju attacks. Not once did I feel bored or that the movie was dragging. Del Toro outdid himself with this one. 9 out 10, and only because I have to leave a little bit of headroom for the best of the best. With time maybe it will earn that last star. Go see this movie!"
"chandan0026","8","4","11","16 July 2013"," 2 hours of full entertainment of your life
","Now for Pacific Rim. Yet again a late entry to the Agartala Rupasi Cinema Hall for us and maybe we missed the first entry of Giant alien like monster called ""Kaiju"". These aliens are into 600-foot monsters instead of mile-wide flying saucers, so they begin pumping huge beasties through the dimensional rift. Killing these monsters with conventional weapons takes days and leaves ruined cities strewn across the Pacific coast, so the only reasonable course of action is to build giant nuclear-powered robots called ""Jaeger"" that can take them on in mixed-martial-arts battles or you can say Mortal Kombat. And good thing is that No one person can pilot these giant robots - it takes two carefully matched people linked together in a neural interface called The Drift, they can mind-meld with their giant robots and fight with these monsters. For one of this Drift in a scene, feel very near to one of my favorite movie Inception and that's clinched my heart to stay in the hall. And better thing is that these robots are much more advance than the Iron Man or any other counterpart. I feel it's never been done this well before, and probably never will be again. The fights are clever and creative, because the giant monsters adapt to the tactics of the robots, which in turn receive weapons upgrades and redesigns. You never know what's going to happen next, and all of the battle scenes are eye-popping. Though they tries a bit research part, but unable to shift the magnetism of Jaeger or Kaiju.<br/><br/>Acting wise, there is nothing to say more, because there is not much space left to show the actor skills. It's more about fighting and fighting. But few mixed tiny romance and emotion will fulfill your requirement too. Charlie Hunnam and Charlie Day are as good as their character in the film. Love the way Rinko Kikuchi as beautiful and mysterious Mako Mori slowly pronounces the English in a precocious little-girl voice on each occasion she converses and her emotion with Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). And find irresistible when Guillermo Del Toro calls his old Hell Boy star Ron Perlman for a cameo with his golden shoe.<br/><br/>But again some flaws are there. Interpretation in the mind of Kaiju looks very messy, less than real. While we have no choice but to accept the notion that we'll have the ability to construct 250-foot-tall robots just a few years from now—robots that can somehow be transported by eight tiny helicopters—it is never explained why chemical or biological agents, for example, were never deployed. And even question remain why they did not try any missile for these monster without disturbing the city life when they well aware their expected return. If we did not miss, there should be an explanation of original ingress of Kaiju.<br/><br/>But overall, a lot of middle-aged guys like me are going to feel 15 years younger while watching it, and that's not bad value for your expensive theater ticket. You will experience the 2 hours of full entertainment of your life. A must watch if you are near to a Inox or any other equivalent where you will be blessed with the movie on the screen and 3D glass on your eyes."
"thenachoman","9","4","11","15 July 2013"," Reignited my faith in the summer blockbuster
","Ten minutes into Pacific Rim I turned to my sister sitting next to me and said ""This is f***** good"" I can't remember the last time I did that. Maybe as a 15 year old teenager when watching Independence Day? I'm now 30 so for this film to achieve that suggests either I'm not as cynical as I thought, or Pacific Rim is just bloody good.<br/><br/>I went into this film with pretty low expectations. My friend who loves Japanese anime was all over this movie and has been raving about it for ages. Big robots fighting big monsters though - didn't sell it for me. I used to like the original Godzilla years ago but the 90s remake killed that for me. <br/><br/>Pacific Rim has reignited my faith in Hollywood to deliver great summer blockbusters. I had faith in Guillermo del Toro and that faith paid off. (Not to mention everyone else who was involved in the film - sometimes we forget that a movie isn't made by a director alone)<br/><br/>I love big budget Hollywood action movies. But they have to be fun. Independence Day reigns supreme in my view for that reason. The Mummy isn't far behind. I can get on-board with all the cheesiness, bad one liners and plot holes if the film doesn't take itself too seriously, is a great spectacle and is just fun to watch. Tick tick tick, Pacific Rim delivers.<br/><br/>Enough navel gazing why is Pacific Rim so good?<br/><br/>First the visual editing. That $180 million budget? Del Toro uses slow cuts and low edits so you can actually see where it all went! Michael Bay take note. Some scenes almost feel like they're in slow mo, which is great. You get to see every detail of the carnage as it happens.<br/><br/>The music is also great. Before I saw Pacific Rim I noted Game of Thrones guru Ramin Djawadi did the score. You can definitely tell. By the time the climax of Pacific Rim is reached I was feeling shivers every time the score started it's riff. <br/><br/>The visuals and sound are important but at the end of the day even the biggest summer blockbuster needs a decent storyline and good characters. Unfortunately the human element is all too often lost in a visual FX heavy movie. But del Toro may have finally shown how to strike the balance. He does this by borrowing from the mech-human theme in Avatar but more effectively, because here the humans are inside the massive robots rather than being controlled like in a video game. When the monsters rip open the robots in Pacific Rim, the humans are painfully and sometimes fatally exposed. This is effective. I never felt the robots were invulnerable, in fact they felt surprisingly fragile especially by the climax of the film.<br/><br/>In films like this there is never going to be time for character heavy development but Pacific Rim does better than most. When robots died I felt gutted for the pilots, particularly the Russians at the end (is there an action movie that had ever existed that doesn't feature at least one Russian stereotype?)<br/><br/>The storyline isn't especially amazing but it's well executed. Films like this we all really know what's going to happen, it's how it happens that's riveting - execution becomes key. Del Toro doesn't fail to deliver. <br/><br/>Effective performances for a largely unknown cast - thank god they didn't cast Tom Cruise for the main character - that would've been an epic fail. Especially strong is Idris Ilba who channels The Wire's Stringer Bell like a laser in one particularly good scene.<br/><br/>Over the last 10 years with increasing ticket prices and poorly implemented 3-d I've  often walked out of a movie theatre feeling ripped off. Walking out of Pacific Rim I felt like I'd got my money's worth. It reminded me why I enjoy summer blockbusters too - they're a helluva lot of fun."
"rooee","5","4","11","15 July 2013"," As personal as Pan
","Guillermo Del Toro is a filmmaker who has straddled the art-house/mainstream divide since his first feature, Cronos, in 1993. This is because he himself apparently doesn't recognise this divide, so it isn't evident in his films. In terms of scale, style, and theme, Pacific Rim might be as far from, say, The Devil's Backbone as one can get, but it's just as much the work of its author, because Del Toro is as fascinated by the Spanish Civil War as he is enthralled by the Kaiju (""strange creature"") tradition of Japanese cinema. Pacific Rim is Del Toro's love letter to Godzilla and its offspring.<br/><br/>The setting is the near future. The story concerns a Rift between worlds, through which 100-foot monsters are coming to Earth to kick-off big style. The only thing standing between the Rift and human annihilation is the Jaeger programme: humankind builds its own, metallic monsters to bodyslam the Kaiju into oblivion. They've a matter of months to ""cancel the apocalypse"". It's too barmy a premise to start asking serious questions (why not simply guard the Rift with nuclear warheads?), and this silliness is one of the film's strengths.<br/><br/>The special effects are a spectacle to behold. The giants never have the weightless quality of earlier CG, and the sense of scale is hugely impressive. Del Toro keeps the action admirably clear, eschewing the sorts of fast cuts that would have done an injustice to the immense power of his mighty pugilists. And while it is a film about fighting at the edge of annihilation, the tone is always light, with comic relief never far away - particularly when an old friend of Del Toro's shows up in the second act.<br/><br/>What drags the film toward mediocrity are the protagonist and the movie's sheer length. 90 minutes of melodramatic cliché would be a breeze - but we've well over two hours with Charlie Hunnam leading the way, and he's no leading man. I thought I was watching Garrett Hedlund (Tron: Legacy) at first, but then I realised this guy has even less charisma. Main-man duties should have been left to Idris Elba, as the conflicted commander and protector of the dwindling Jaeger project, whose performance - heightened but subtle - is pitched perfectly for the material.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim was never going to be as deep as the ocean of its title, but to expect otherwise would be like complaining that there are no slow-mo shootouts in Good Night and Good Luck. It's a robot versus monster movie, from a moviemaker who loves the genre. It could have done with a shave in the editing room, and possibly some of that big budget could have gone on a star for the driving seat (even Will Smith had Bad Boys before he got the Independence Day gig). But if you're asking for a gleefully bloated, uncynical hooray for humanity, you can't ask for more."

Don't expect a story, expect calamity!<br/><br/>Pacific Rim Review: Script Analysis<br/><br/>Pacific Rim has been made on visionary scale in terms of detailing and technicalities, but the story suffers a major blow. Beginning off well with a voice over about the Kaiju War, the story lacks rarity in it. The Kaiju which seem distant kins of Godzilla, is pasted on a gargantuan canvas. Story wise, it is not emotionally wicked. The backstory that validated the commanding officer's paternal affinity with Mako lacked the dramatic punch. Mostly, the theory postulated by Dr Newton about the Kaiju brains being clones, is concluded abruptly, leaving it half baked. There were unnecessary deviations from the plot. With Newton going in search of Kaiju brain to a black market dealer Hannibal Chau is lame as it wraps up into nothing. It is disappointing to see such intelligent concepts wrapping up into nothing! The eye popping expectations are met mostly, but the film's plot is so slim that it loses its ground without flaunting its action prowess!"

But this movie manages to fail on every conceivable level. The acting might possibly be the worst acting in any film I've ever seen to date. You'll find yourself halfway through the film, seriously rooting 1. for the aliens to kill off the humans and 2. for the movie to be over. The dialog is the worst in any film I've seen to date. I found myself laughing at the characters delivery of it and bored to tears at the same time. To give this film one star is only because I had to in order to rate it. This movie could have been amazing and the special effects should have saved it but I have issues with that part of the movie as well. For me, I didn't care for the color scheme of the robots or the aliens, often times when they were battling, in my opinion, it was a muddy vision and hard to detect one from the other. The action sequences just became a muddled ball. They were moments, I'll say where the visuals worked but very fleeting moments but moments that reminded me of such lost potential. I really wanted to like this but it was a mess and a disaster."

"xtinamae76","1","2","4","28 February 2014"," Highly Disappointing
","I was really excited to watch this movie because the previews looked great, and Charlie Day is one of my favorite comedic actors. It was really disappointing, mainly because of the blatant sexism. I understand that Hollywood has to cater to the Eastern market because it is broke, but I don't think that is any excuse to assimilate Eastern outdated views on women into our movies. The (only) main female character in this movie is a tiny little Asian woman with a tiny little voice and she just needs big strong men to allow her to do things and save her. It is just over the top sexist. I stopped watching after a while. :("

","As I watched this movie I felt Guillermo del Toro asking me: Wanna have a dose of sweet awesome fun? Grab some popcorn, buy a red flavored Icee, lay back and enjoy this movie brother. And that was all I did.<br/><br/>This movie tells the story about people who pilot giant robots that are up to stop the obliteration of our species when giant monsters, straight out of every ones childhood fantasy, burst out of a portal in the Pacific Ocean. It may sound cliché, and I can proudly say it is full of clichés and it doesn't shy away from the fact. It knows what it was sent to this good earth for and that is entertain the hell out of us. And it does that oh so good. And looks astonishing while doing so! From the plot it is implied you expect some ginormous robot vs big monster battles, and holy crap are they going to blow your skin of. Beautifully filmed for you to see the scale of the situations and for these brawls to look just badass. The Hong Kong battle in particular is going to stand out as a perfect set piece for me. And responsible for all of this are the special effects. In my opinion what helps to scale out things is are the water effects. How it cascades off these giants is as realistic as it gets. After all this focus on its looks and battles you may be wondering about the human element of the movie. While not perfect the arcs these characters go through with each other are fun to watch. Especially Idris Elba who transmits authority like a boss. Charlie Hunamm while not as good manages to hold as a main character. Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead is the one who should win the ""Underrated hot chick of the year"" award. And finally we have the two crazy scientists played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who while incredibly cliché and hyped up on something unknown tend to be funny and energetic. A curious fact in the movie is that it shows the social reaction to these monsters and robots and realistically it isn't always fear but propaganda and adapting to the situation. The second one involves Ron Perlman in it. After all this praise there is one stand out sequence that involves Mako's (Rinko Kikuchi's) past that you should really look out for. It changes the tone to a more serious and dark one and is made with excellence.<br/><br/>And of course there has to be a negative or two in this flick and the one negative I can pick is that while the movie builds itself on clichés sometimes these go over the legal limit and strive into predictability and unoriginality. But in general this is an amazing achievement in entertainment and special effects that you should really look for if you are having a grey day and want to jack release your worries by watching robots beat the living crap out of some monsters. I'm giving this jacked up child dream a 9/10."
"drqshadow-reviews","5","2","4","6 December 2013"," A Rough-and-Tumble Evolution of the Classic Monster Movie, Pacific Rim Lacks Depth
","Knocking out an entire film's worth of back story before the opening credits, Pacific Rim doesn't waste any time in getting to the good stuff: thousand-foot monsters are swapping haymakers with their robotic counterparts inside of ten minutes. If you were expecting anything different, well, I'm not sure why because Pan's Labyrinth this ain't. It's exactly what the promo materials promised: a big-budget SFX sandwich with a dense layer of sci-fi sensibility spread through its guts. Hold the subtlety and nuance.<br/><br/>Fans of the classic monster movie will be, no doubt, tickled to see the evolution of that format (though some of these beasts are so foreign and complex, it's often tough to distinguish up from down amidst the mayhem of a fight scene) but I was somewhat puzzled by its herky-jerk pacing and weird sense of identity. It's a tale that can't choose between serious action and gaudy eccentricity, so it tries to move in both directions without luck. Likewise, I had difficulty looking past the odd jumble of TV stars mashed together at the center of it all, drawn from very different sources and plunked down together in a series of comically mismatched back-and-forths. The action is good, and abundant, but the plot is quite thin and the core characters are all basic caricatures. It's worth a watch, but only as a home theater demo or a simple bit of drunken escapism."

","This movie is really no different from Michael Bay's Transformers movies but since critics love to kiss them some Guillermo del Toro butt it somehow qualifies as excellent blockbuster entertainment. Just no. It's over two hours of witless CGI explosions and nonsense that left me feeling like a kid had been throwing bricks at my head and hitting it. I'm all for blockbusters, but they should at least have a story or interesting characters and this has neither. If that's too much for a blockbuster to ask for, it needs to at least have entertaining action scenes. This movie doesn't. It doesn't even have the nutty physicality and entertaining slapstick of the Hobbit trilogy, with the only memorable action moment being a giant monster getting clocked in the head with a cargo ship held as a baseball bat. (It's symbolic of what del Toro is doing to you.)<br/><br/>Maybe giant monster movies just aren't my thing. When everything is so upscaled there's little impact when anything happens and I think that's fundamentally the same problem Bay's Transformers movies had."

","When Pacific Rim first came out I felt like I was so bombarded by the likes of Transformers, GI Joe, Godzilla and all the Marvel and DC movies that I just couldn't wrap my head around the idea of another Sci-Fi; ""world in jeopardy"" style film, but now having watched Pacific Rim I've got to admit that it's a pretty cool story. Giant monsters called ""Kaiju"" start randomly coming out of the Pacific Ocean to wreak havoc on the most densely populated cities on the planet so Earth comes up with this idea of building these giant mech-warriors called ""Jaggers"" that are about the same size as the monsters in order to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the monsters: Awesome!<br/><br/>To me the battles are really high end CGI, but at the same time sort of lack creativity in some ways and are a little slow. I grew up on 90s style action-cartoons with fight scenes that were right on par with my imagination so I thought there could have been more creativity with how to beat these monsters and look better, and faster doing it.<br/><br/>For the most part I was pretty impressed by the acting. Hunnam and Elba lead the story really well playing off of each others grittiness and remaining calm despite the fact that they know mankind may not be able to survive the next attack from the Kaiju since the relentless assault of the past 10 years has really taken its toll. The only character that seemed out of sorts and unbelievable was Rinko Kikuchi. I don't know what B-level soap opera they found her in, but everything she did seemed unauthentic for the situation of the movie. Charlie Day somehow seemed less annoying than he usually is and dare I say his comic relief was much appreciated? Ron Pearlman's cameo was a great bonus as well!<br/><br/>I give this one an 8/10 and if you liked Godzilla I think you'll like this movie even better!"

","Why on earth would you go from being a top-tier pilot for the military, to being a construction worker? That just makes no sense... I know that they did it so that the character that Charlie Hunnam plays would seem like an 'everyman's man', but it simply doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Another thing that doesn't make sense: Why are all the Jaegers (robots) melee? That makes very little sense in reality... why engage with melee Kaiju (monsters) in melee? Why not just build Jaegers that have a crap tonne of missiles and lazer weapons, and blast the Kaiju into another dimension from far away? I know the movie would be drastically different if that were the case, but it would also be much cooler imo, because everyone knows big guns are better than big swords. I just think it's a huge plot hole.<br/><br/>But other than the gaping plot-holes that this movie has, the movie is a 2hr trip filled with good CGI and a tonne of sci-fi and action fans will love it. For once though, I'd like to see the main actor+actress NOT end up kissing... it's a completely played-out trope that needs to be put on ice for a few years, honestly."

The best scenes are the voice over ones that introduce everything and a flash back scene. Everything comes together seamlessly, it even brings the feels that the rest of the movie doesn't have. The Jaeger fights in this are alright, aside from the first one they're kind of alright nothing really happens until the end.<br/><br/>The characters are pretty bland but interesting enough to keep you entertaining, just not much depth to them. Very similar to those in horror movies, they have their quirks but aside from that a bit flat. The stand out character is Charlie Day's Newt, he steals every scene he's in. He just chews up the scenery, he also bring a lot of rumor to quite a bleak movie. Ron Perlmanwas awesome as well, I did like the rest of the cast as well but they stood out the most.<br/><br/>All in all it was pretty good, quality wise I'd say this movie is on par with Man of Steel and Godzilla King of the monsters."

","This movie is good, and that's about it. Didn't really bring anything new on the table, didn't really dive into emotion or morals here and there, but it was still a spectacle.<br/><br/>Yes, we've seen this before. It's an apocalyptic (kind of) world that's being taken over by a different species and human beings try their best to survive and fight whatever is in their way to end this problem. Besides the science behind the Jaegers, regarding the two pilot locking neural bridge gizmo, or the Kaijus; Robots fighting monsters, point is, it's cliched and we get it. Although the film is simple in nature, it's the action and the CGI that actually carry this film to victory. The sequences of the Jaegers fighting the Kaijus just look magnificent and thrilling to watch, that it makes one forget about the certain ""essentials"" needed in a good film. It's just one fun roller-coaster ride that takes you to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Idris Elba, like always, was great in this film. I can feel the assertiveness and emotion in his character. Unfortunately, I think Charlie Hunnam could have done a better job with his speech delivery and emotion, but that's barely a problem. All the other actors were exceptional, and they did what was asked of them.<br/><br/>Like I said, it was a good, entertaining, and enjoyable film to watch.

I also liked the arc of Mako and her relationship with Idris Elba's character. Also a very well-established main plot overall, the idea of two pilots leading one Jaeger seems realistic in our world in terms of technology, and the concept I resonated with a lot was all the countries coming together as ONE and putting their differences aside in order to defeat their common enemy the Kaiju's.

It does have a few technical plot holes here and there, but the film does have a 'let's just get on with it' kind of feel. The alien creatures (Kaiju) are great and the robot v monster battles are superb. Towards the end the pace picks right up and the story starts to fall apart a bit, but by that point who cares? In general Pacific Rim is a fast paced, slick looking piece of techno-action that most Sci-Fi fans will enjoy. It's big, loud, dumb and very pretty, largely due to Guillermo Del Toro being at the helm.<br/><br/>The movie does have cool fight scenes and pretty cool music which is always a plus."

","I remember really enjoying this film when I was younger, the idea of giant machines fighting Godzilla creatures was incredibly captivating. If you go into Pacific Rim hoping to view some large scale fight scenes you will certainly get what you want. However the smaller features of this film can drag it down to the level of Marvel films upon rewatch, although I would put this on a higher pedestal than most of those.<br/><br/>My first problem is the film's pacing, we open up with an exhilarating fight scene which really sets the tone of what's to come. But then the rest of the first act really drags. We don't see any more fight scenes for a massive chunk of the film and then the last 30 minutes is just action. I wouldn't say I was ever bored watching Pacific Rim, it just had the tendency of straying away from what made the film stand out.<br/><br/>Another problem I have is the lighting and colour grading. I think a lot of the fight scenes are way too dark and the character scenes have adopted this murky yellow/brown colouration. This could be intentional to create an industrial feel to these scenes however it doesn't excuse the film from looking ugly.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of this film is it's score/soundtrack which really lifts the action to another level.<br/><br/>Overall I do think Pacific Rim is worth a watch but don't expect to be motivated to ever watch it more than once."

","In Pacific Rim, director Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy & Pan's Labyrinth) presents us a Godzilla meets Transformers flick of monumental proportions.<br/><br/>In the not-too-distant future, a race of monstrous aliens called Kaiju (Japanese for monster) attack earth through an underwater portal in the depths of the Pacific ocean. They wreak havoc on several coastal cities across the globe laying persons & property to waste in the typical Hollywood style assited with a good dose of CGI. After finding that the conventional weapons are futile against these monsters which appear evolving into ever more dangerous creatures, humans respond by building their own combat force of monstrous robots called Jaegers (German for Hunters). Every Jagger is required to be piloted by two humans since a single human is incapable -mentally & physically - of controlling this colossal machine. The brains of the two pilots are connected through a technology called neutral drift which in turn operates as a singular command unit controlling the Jaeger.<br/><br/>What follows is a series of visceral action set pieces in which the Jaegers take on the Kaijus on land, water and even air through traditional combat styles that includes fisticuffs, swords and some heavy duty artillery. The success of these movies depend a lot on the level of visual mastery which could make the viewer go WOW. The story and the characters are at best props that aid in unravelling the carefully planned action set-pieces though Del Toro does try valiantly to build certain emotional depth to each of the characters.<br/><br/>While Del Toro is no Cameron or Whedon here, it helps that he is definitely not Michael Bay either. He definitely knows the quality of output that is required to engage the viewer without making a mere noisy mangled mess of the visual effects through stunts where one never knows who is fighting whom to what effect. The action here, while loud (which puts me off personally) is well designed, executed with panache and captured well which engages the viewer (especially in IMAX 3D). A rousing score accentuates the action on screen though, at times, it gets drowned in the melee of the wreckage around.<br/><br/>It may not score big on the front of story or characters that touch your heart or a plot that engages your grey matter. It is designed to be and remains a delectable eye-candy for action junkies who prefer some well executed action setpieces on some CGI wizardry and to that extent, is very satisfying and fun watch. Guilty pleasure, if one may prefer to call it so ...."

What Del Toro established was loosely based off of a lot of Japanese's comics and cartoons, but executed in an ultra realistic way. Everything from the water the Jaegers waded through to the epic fight scenes. Ramin Djwadi did an absolutely fantastic job with the ost. You may recognize him from iron man and game of thrones. The actors also did a great job. The lead actor was the weakest in my opinion. All of the supporting actors did a spectacular, though.

","Whenever Guillermo Del Toro directs a film, chances are that it will be noticed. In the past, he was best known for his pair of Hellboy movies and the masterful Pan's Labyrinth. However, the former were kind of like buddy cop movies crossed with Lord of the Rings, while the latter was an intimate, character driven fantasy and coming-of-age film. In his entire career, Del Toro has never made anything like this. The premise is simple: gargantuan, extradimensional monsters are laying waste to the world's coastal population centers. To fight back, humanity creates equally large robots to push the beasts back. It really doesn't get much more basic than than that. Clearly, this is not a film meant to be analyzed or possess some deeper meaning. All it is - and all it delivers - are old-school thrills meant to fulfill a 12-year-old's greatest fantasy. As such, the characters are strictly one-dimensional, caricatures copied and pasted from a thousand other movies. While some may find this off-putting, keep in mind that the characters are not the focus of the film. That position belongs to the robots, monsters, and scenes involving robots fighting monsters. And to that end, this film is an unqualified success."

","Pacific Rim is good but not great.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
The reason this movie is good is because of the characters, but it's also a reason for why it's not great.
Raleigh is a pretty bland protagonist that has a conflict which never ever gets explored and gets ignored through out the movie which makes him really bland and the acting of that protagonist isn't really that amazing either.
Mako is the only one who is even a decent character cause they manage to give her conflict and a backstory in a subtle way which gives the viewer enough information to know what's going on with her character but also wanting more from her backstory (they showed that greatly with the scene of her as a kid) and doing that they can actually make sequels, novels, comics etc explaining her backstory so they can get extra cash by expanding the lore of Pacific rim (which they did).
But how they finished mako's character arc was bad.
When they used the gipsy (I think) for the first time it didn't go well for mako and mako couldn't control the gipsy with Raleigh which would be a good way to develop her character but they just ignore and for the second time the use gipsy they did very well ignoring the conflict that was set up.
Chuc Hansen is a very bad character.
The reason I bring him up is cause they rushed his character arc and executed it very poorly.
They broke the rule with show don't tell and Stacker just said every problem Chuc Hansen had which could potentially be used to develop Hansen. One of those problems were daddy issues which the movie never shown that Chuc had so we never knew it until Stacker said it.<br/><br/>CGI
the CGI was really good and they manage to blend in the location the robot and the Kaiju really well.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action was bland it was basically a robot hitting a monster in the most blandest way possible.
It was just a bunch of basic moves you see used in many movies.
And the weird thing is that when Raleigh was fighting Makos candidates the fighting style there is very very different from what we see in the movie.
In real life they use a certain fighting style that's pretty well choreographed but when they fight in the robot that fighting style gets thrown out the window and they just use basic fighting techniques.<br/><br/>FINAL ACT
The final act was great and put me on edge managing to finalize a bit of Makos arc and they manage to set the stakes pretty high which is a good feat cause this movie has those ""the end of the world"" stakes that can often go bad.<br/><br/>VERDICT
I heard there was a sequel to this movie which I wonder how that's even possible since they won and they prevented the Kaiju from arriving in their world.
They will probably do a bs explanation to why the Kaiju can still arrive at their world.
6/10 it's fun."

Kaijus then we must have Godzilla! Man I couldn't handle the build up to this film!<br/><br/>Then I saw it... and man was I impressed! I've read a lot saying that the story line was poor and the CGI was too much. What do people honestly want? We're not looking at Shakespearean masterpiece. We're looking at cinema for what it is, a form of escapism, a place you can go and for an hour plus and imagine yourself in another world, and Del Toro allows that.<br/><br/>From the opening scene we are thrown into the action, a voice over from Hunman explains the Kaijus on their destructive path and then explains what we did to combat them... the Jaeger programme. We're shown snippets of Jaegers vs Kaijus and it looks epic. We're told of humanities inevitable downfall of our own making and then we meet Hunman's character Reilly, an over eager show off who fails to listen to his orders. This is shown when he ignores the orders of the indomitable Marshal Pentecost (Elba) and loses his brother to a Kaiju and has to pilot a Jaeger on his own, which is almost impossible. Fast forward five years and the Jaeger programme is all but finished the Kaijus aren't stopping and there's only a few to save us...<br/><br/>If you love big action films with monsters, robots, heroes, aliens, love, jealousy and a little bit of Charlie Day then this is the film for you. It's a thrill ride of seat gripping adventure that won't disappoint."

","Only a few years from now, with Earth battered by an invasion of gigantic beasts through a trans-dimensional rift in the Pacific floor, the best brains on the planet have devised huge human-navigated robot sentinels to fight back. But they may not be enough...
To master a Jaeger, the steeple-tall, nuclear-powered robots built to defend Earth from the Kaijus (huge monsters with fluorescent blood, enormous horned heads and the sole intention of eradicating mankind), it takes two daring pilots neurally linked via a mysterious technology known as The Drift. Indeed, before they can so much as dim the headlights on the Crimson Typhoon, Striker Eureka or Gipsy Danger, three of the pimped-up iron giants on show, the intertwined heroes must be ""Drift compatible"". While it is never made entirely clear what this means (boiling down to a nebulous you-feel-me kind of thing), to enjoy Guillermo del Toro's super-sized version of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em, it might help to be Drift compatible. In other words, get on Pacific Rim's wavelength and there is a primal gratification in its blunt remit of very big metal things fighting very big scaly things in order to prevent an apocalypse. It's as if del Toro has reverse-imagined his movie from how awestruck boys might stage mock-battles between toy lines. This is a spectacular brute of a film where size rather than technique matters.<br/><br/>In fact, the director is again mining his childhood for inspiration, tapping a vein of Japanese monsters versus robots shows, like Ultraman and The Space Giants, imported on the cheap to pick up the slack on Mexican TV. The DNA of their older brother, Godzilla, is self-evident, but del Toro would insist his new film also splices in the genealogy of mythical sea creatures and Goya's unearthly masterpiece The Colossus. The marketing department, well out of earshot, might add the visceral mechanics of the Transformers movies, and all the hi-tech hurly-burly of videogames.<br/><br/>Lumbering automaton-Stallones and mechanised-Schwarzeneggers (with heaving chests and tiny heads), 25 storeys tall, the Jaegers essentially wrestle their awful foes (another Mexican thing?) - although they also boast retractable swords and spinning saws - in a succession of massive scraps. The putative plot has the robots battering their way towards the glowing deep-sea rift to slam it shut.<br/><br/>This primitive dynamic, however ludicrous (what about hurling big missiles from a safe distance?), provides a physical rush made doubly vivid by the unsteadying effect of 3D. But like many sci-fi visions liberated by CG, the geography of destruction is hard to follow. You get a barrage of sensation, scaled against crumbling cityscapes, but are left guessing how one battle is won and another lost. Within their cockpit heads, the two heroes enact hooks and jabs like deranged puppeteers.<br/><br/>These humans rarely rise above the risible. As thinly drawn as their teatime-TV ancestors, they are heroes as mechanical as the robots, pre-programmed with personal issues (chiefly dead relatives), too easily overcome. The performances get no further than their overcharged names: Charlie Hunnam is gravel-voiced maverick Raleigh Becket; Rinko Kikuchi his troubled, greenhorn co-pilot Mako Mori; while Idris Elba, as the unit's commander Stacker Pentecost, stomps out dialogue so wooden and portentous, you fear the apocalypse may be over by the time he's finished.<br/><br/>If you come to this movie seeking the dreamy Gothic play and human passions of del Toro's corpus, you will be confounded. Perhaps, after years stalled on The Hobbit and At The Mountains Of Madness, he just needed to get a film under his belt, and the juvenile exuberance of the opportunity swept him along. The film isn't entirely bereft of the director's hallmarks. The Jaeger depot, located in a neon-soaked Hong Kong, is a cavernous citadel mixing hi-tech gizmos with vast clockwork apparatus; surely designs once meant for the dwarvish forges of The Hobbit. Lucky charm Ron Perlman makes us all nostalgic for the swampy superhero subversion of Hellboy as a surly, one-eyed black-market dealer in Kaiju body parts (their bone dust makes a powerful aphrodisiac). And in the sight of a prostate Jaeger washed up on a snowy beach like a fallen Titan from Greek myth, you catch a glimpse of that other del Toro, the artist still linked and compatible.<br/><br/>Could audiences be suffering cataclysm fatigue? Exhausted by the thought of another city pulverised like pie crust - Pacific Rim's street fights the size of streets arrive after an unending parade of city-smashing antics this summer. Possibly, but this is a cheekier brand of Armageddon - del Toro is giving scope to a boyhood lust for mayhem, the multi-million-dollar equivalent of kicking over sandcastles and torturing insects. There is something infectiously juvenile in that. Catch his Drift and you'll have a brawl.<br/><br/>A big, brash, unpretentious B movie that lives down to its billing: robots punching monsters - it does what it says on the Rim."

","The Pacific Rim trailer caught my attention. You expect a film about big robots (like in Transformers) versus Godzilla monsters. When I saw that the film was 132 minutes long, I wondered if we would just analyze horses like this, sort of, one more time, get to see them in the film. Fortunately, this is not the case.
The film starts with a prologue, It has been said that a portal in the Pacific takes place samples (called Kaiju) and then attack the earth. The people have to make their own monsters, giant robots called Jeagers to fight the Kaiju. The Jeagers need two pilots. The thoughts, memories and emotions of the two pilots are connected to each other in order to control the Jeager.
The story goes somewhere in the middle of what it is now. The first fight takes place at night, it is difficult to see what is happening. The Kaiju was safe to see. You can not clearly see from the Kaiju a real picture that it has been edited with the computer. Fortunately, all other Kaiju feathers are good to see. After the first fight, the movie really starts.
Idris Elba's character asks the main character, an old Jeager pilot to come back to the Jeager team. Back at the Jeager team, the protagonist meets the character Mako. The two goes finally together in a Jeager against the Kaiju fighting to protect the world. We see a few fights between the Kaiju and Jeagers. You learn more about the other characters and their view of the world. The goal of the Jeagers is to stop the Kaiju, close the portal in the Pacific Ocean and thus prevent the earth from being lost.
The fighting between the Kaiju and Jeagers looks great. You really get the feeling that two huge things are being destroyed and everything around them.
The Kaiju were not all the same what the trailer is so late. Each Kaiju looked different and had given his own special gifts. The characters are interesting to see because they are in each other's brains during the fighting and get a special bond. What is special is that it is not the most important thing to look at. The character Mako steals the show, especially with the emotional scene about her past. Idris Elba is also doing great as the leader of Jeager's team.
Pacific Rim is a great film with a good story. Definitely worth seeing. So far it is not the best film I saw in 2013."

","In the modern-day action film you come to expect it: The big special-effects, blockbuster extravaganza! The world in peril; Only one hero can save us; It's all-out action! ""Pacific Rim"" is all of those things. And while it's enjoyable for what it is, it doesn't bring you anything you haven't seen before.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around an inter-dimension rift in the ocean, that allows giant monsters to come into our world. The only force to stop them are giant robots, called ""Jaegers,"" which rely on two pilots to control it. When the threat of the monsters becomes too great, the ""Jaegers"" must undertake a mission that is a do-or-die proposition for them and the Earth!<br/><br/>As I said, this film hits all the notes that you expect. There's lots of action and visual effects on display. And some of the battles are a bit exciting. But it also has character plots that are so by-the-numbers, that you could set your watch to them. The one jerk pilot (played by Robert Kazinsky) is always poking our hero pilot (played by Charlie Hunnam), so you know a throw down between them is inevitable. Then you have the story point about only one other guy having piloted a ""Jaeger"" solo, besides our hero, and they telegraph to you who it is, so when it is revealed, there is absolutely no surprise at all to it. Much of the character development stuff between the battles, while not dragging in pace, certainly doesn't do much to advance your interest or investment in the characters. It's decent filler material, but you'll see the ""twists"" coming a mile away.<br/><br/>There is some nice comedy relief from Charlie Day's and Burn Gorman's characters, as they play a couple of squabbling and competitive scientists, looking to figure out a way to stop the monsters for good. And Ron Perlman's turn as a sleazy black market salesman is good for a few laughs, too. They bring a little bit of campy life to the script and downtime moments from the action sequences, which are enjoyable. But, overall, the character moments are just there to kill the time between monster fights. Director Guillermo del Toro knows that he's not looking to make a great dramatic tale, but a fast-paced action epic that is filled with lots of visual eye-candy for the viewer. And, for the most part, he accomplishes that much.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Pacific Rim"" is what it is and does what it sets out to do. But it doesn't give you anything new, that you haven't seen before. To me, the film is basically ""Voltron meets Godzilla (the 1998 version)!"" It's a movie that's all about having some big, dumb fun, as it asks you to check your brain at the door. It's far from the worst movie you could see and there are definitely worse ways to kill 131 minutes of your day. So, if you are looking for a visually exciting spectacle, that won't cause you to tax your mental capacities, this film will give you what you crave! If you are looking for something more, you'd probably best look elsewhere."

","I really enjoyed this movie, it's pretty much all you could ask for from a movie like this. Cool action scenes, great robots and special effects and excellent monsters. When you're watching a movie like this... You don't really expect a deep story with really complex characters, right? This movie is just great at what it's trying to do, I watched it years ago in cinema on release but it was pretty memorable. One of the stupid things about this movie is that the robots have this bad*ss chain sword that can literally cut a monster in half with one slice but they could have used it more often, right? It makes the huge guns on the robots look like peashooters compared to it and it has perfect close-quarters capability against a similar monster. Otherwise it's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes great high budget action movies, it reminds me of the Michael Bay Transformers movie but better. Which I like, yeah, I really enjoyed the first three movies, fight me. 7/10!"
"jb_campo","8","0","0","7 January 2019"," Knock out hit
","Pacific Rim is a surprisingly good monster movie with real plot lines that drive the movie to success. PR is way better than any Godzilla flic because it weaves an actual story involving people, not just cardboard characters that bring nothing to the story.<br/><br/>Some time in the future, Kaiju (Japanese for Beasts) start to emerge from a breach in the tectonic plates under the Pacific ocean. Humans end up creating Jaegers (German for Hunter), huge robot fighting machines, to stop the Kaiju. These robots are massive - tall as skyscrapers, and weigh thousands of tons.<br/><br/>The story pulls you in because the world is under siege and countries actually cooperate with each other for self survival. Your interest starts at the country level, while director Del Toro quickly brings it down to a level you can better identify with - the one-on-one type. You learn about a Jaeger pilot, Raleigh (played by unknown Charlie Hunnam), and his brother. These Jaegers require two pilots to operate them, left brain/right brain, because the neural stress is too much for one person. These brother pilots go out on a hunt and things go bad. There's a terrific fight scene in Alaska with a beach scene that introduces you to the sacrifices these people make to save the world. The story then pulls you in and never lets go.<br/><br/>Raleigh gives up piloting and takes up construction to help build a wall that no one believes can stop these monsters, but he withdraws from the world. Until we then meet Commander Stacker, played masterfully by Idris Elba - he was terrific. The story then goes all over the world, from New York to California, to England, to Hong Kong. Other interesting characters come into play, led by Mako (Rinko Kikuchi - actually a pretty well-established actress). Two crazy scientists, a con/Kaiju parts dealer (Ron Perlman is excellent), and internal adversaries join the excellent cast.<br/><br/>Casting was terrific. Raleigh and Mako have great chemistry on screen. Cmdr Stacker exudes leadership. Crazy scientists excude wild abandon in search of science. Bad guys are heartless. In the end, internal adversaries bond together, and it was all terrifically believable due to the casting. The acting was also top notch. All actors gave strong performances in their roles.<br/><br/>The cinematography was uneven, mostly due to lighting. As Jaegers and Kaiju did battle in various scenes, just like the Transformer movies, it was often hard to tell who was doing what to whom because of the darkness. Smashing battles in the city were easier, and monsters spewing colored venom helped, but that's my major issue with the movie. Better lighting definition would have drawn me in more to the fight scenes, which were numerous.<br/><br/>By far the best part of the movie, after the excellent storyline, was the CGI. The robot hunters were very realistic. The computer control rooms were very realistic, as were the graphics used by the Jaeger pilots in their control room. You never felt the monstors or robots were out of scale to themselves or their surroundings, which is often an issue with cheaper CGI films, like the old Godzilla vs Mothra type movies. The monsters were really well done too. You could tell that the fight scenes took a lot time and care to make them very realistic.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim succeeds on every level, while throwing in a cliche here and there, and your expected Hollywood ending. You'll feel happy, sad, happy/sad, and relate to these poor people fighting for their lives against all odds. Story, acting, casting, directing, CGI, oh, and the music too, which strongly supported the story. All were great.<br/><br/>PR is a must-see film for monster-movie enthusiasts and general film lovers alike. Enjoy."

","I assumed when I heard about this movie, it was one based on video game, it isn't, but I had the feeling before watching it that it was going to be cheesy, and I wasn't wrong, directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water). Basically in a futuristic world, an interdimensional portal called the ""Breach"" opens at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, from which giant monsters called the Kaiju emerge. To combat the Kaiju threat, humanity builds massive robotic machines called Jaegers, each machine is piloted by two or more people, who are mentally linked in a process called ""Drifting"", sharing the mental stress. In 2020, the Becket brothers, Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), pilots of Gipsy Danger, are launched to defend Anchorage from monster Knifehead. During the battle, Knifehead kills Yancy, Raleigh barely pilots the machine alone, but kills the Kaiju and crashed on the shoreline, traumatised by his brother's death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program. Five years later, the power and numbers of Kaiju have increased, causing world governments to end funding for the continuous construction of Jaegers in favour of defence walls. Marshal Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) moves the four remaining Jaegers to the last Jaeger Shatterdome in Hong Kong and plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying the Breach with a nuclear weapon. Striker Eureka, piloted by Herc Hansen (Max Martini) and his son Chuck (EastEnders' Robert Kazinsky) kills Mutavore in Sydney, Australia, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of the walls. Pentecost persuades Raleigh to rejoin the program, they meet with Jaeger restoration program director Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Raleigh and Mako try their first drift, but Mako is almost lost in the memory of a Kaiju attacking Tokyo, which killed her family, and she is relieved of piloting duty, it is relieved that Pentecost saved and raised her. Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) to plan the assault on the Breach. Using a piece of Kaiju brain, Newton discovers the monsters are scouts sent by invading beings from another dimension, his discovery also establishes a two-way mental link, allowing the Kaiju to gain knowledge from his, as he did from them. Pentecost tasks Newton with finding black market dealer and seller Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) for a fresh piece of Kaiju brain. Later, monsters Leatherback and Otachi emerge and rampage through Hong Kong, Otachi destroys Crimson Typhoon and Leatherback destroys Cherno Alpha, Striker Eureka loses all power from an EMP blast, but Gipsy Danger manages to kill both Kaiju. Newton and Chau find out that Otachi is pregnant, an infant Kaiju is born, swallows Chau whole, and dies, drifting with the infant's brain, Newton and Hermann discover the Breach will only open in the presence of a Kaiju's DNA. Pentecost is dying from radiation sickness from piloting a Jaeger with a nuclear core, he gives a rallying speech and pilots Striker Eureka with Chuck, as Herc is injured. Along with Gipsy Danger, they approach the Breach; three Kaiju, Scunner, Raiju and Slattern emerge to defend it. After Raiju is killed, Pentecost and Chuck sacrifice themselves by detonating the bomb, which kills Scunner and wounds Slattern. Raleigh and Mako kill Slattern and drag it to the Breach, where Mako is ejected and Raleigh successfully overloads the Jaeger's reactor, destroying and closing the Breach. Raleigh and Mako surface in the Pacific Ocean in escape pods, Herc orders the war clock to be stopped, indicating mankind's victory and Raleigh and Mako embrace, Chau is also seen alive, cutting himself out of the Kaiju infant. Also starring Clifton Collins Jr. as Ops Tendo Choi. Hunnam is okay, he and Kikuchi don't have a convincing romantic chemistry, Day and Gorman are stereotypical as the silly comedy double-act scientist buddies, only the performance of Elba seems credible as the leader of the resistance. It is a simple concept, monsters that come from another world through a portal in the ocean, and giant mind-controlled robots are built to fight them to the death, there are no complaints about the stylish and visually impressive special effects to bring the creatures, machines and action to life, and it does have the del Toro visual flourishes, but the daft dialogue and overall lack of engaging stuff slow things down most of the time, I felt like turning it off at some points because of how boring it became, it is a nonsense science-fiction action adventure.

","The film opens with a narration. It explains that a portal has opened connecting us to another universe in the Pacific Rim. Through this hole emerges destructive creatures from 60's Japanese films, updated of course. In a missed plot point, conventional means of fighting them seem to be useless, so we construct 100-150 foot tall robots called Jaegers to combat them. Missiles fired from Jaegers are effective, but...okay I tried not to think too hard about it.<br/><br/>The Jaegesr are controlled by 2 people, dressed in ""Star Wars"" storm trooper gear, that are in a mind meld that would make Spock green with envy. They are called pilots because Jaeger masters might be a copyright infringement.<br/><br/>The film combines elements of ""Independence Day,"" ""Starship Troopes,"" ""Transformers"" and ""Ironman"" and sets them into a stolen Japanese plot. Of course the rule is if you steal a plot from Japan you have to hire someone from Japan to be in the film, hence we have Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori. She will eventually team up with John Rico, eh ah Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam because Casper Van Dien is too old) to fight against the monsters coming at an increasing rate. There is a subplot that includes Ron Perlman and Charlie Day.<br/><br/>There are two schools of thought. One is to use the Jaegers to kill the creatures, the other is to build a war to keep out the illegal aliens. When the wall fails to keep out the illegal aliens, the Jaegers can defend the world thanks to ""stand your ground"" principles. Pardon my attempt at political humor.<br/><br/>The supporting characters were better written than the main ones.<br/><br/>This is an over dramatic, action packed popcorn film. The language is designed to appeal to a teen/young adult audience. Looks good on the big screen.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity."

","I like Guillermo Del Toro; I think he has a good vision for fantastical tales that requires translating the imagination onto the screen. Despite it's obvious major flaws, Pacific Rim succeeds in delivering the visual spectacle of rampaging colossi. Quite good in fact, you can - if you wanted to - be charitable to film merely on the basis of the fight between Mechs and Monsters is so well done, that you'll forgive Pacific Rim for being cringey in many instances throughout the film.<br/><br/>To be fair, the story isn't bad. Travis Beachem wrote a straightforward and generic story of humankind's survival that is so transparently Anime inspired that the film could've done well - and perhaps even better - if it was made by Studio Ghibli. However, the script is bad and as I said, cringey a.f. and the acting is just as bad, that if there were more scenes with the human actors, the film would've been tarnished beyond repair. It is the level of acting that you'll find in Live Action TV productions of Ultraman and Black Masked Rider.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there wasn't too, too much of it and there are ample scenes where the Jaegers (them giant robots) were smashing Kaiju (them monsters), wreaking devastation in the sea as well as in the city. The Mechs themselves were impressive to look at, though there were some scenes that didn't just make sense (like why didn't they use the sword early on?) The Kaijus are by far the most interesting; with great biology and abilities that in all honesty, I wish it would have been thoroughly explored.<br/><br/>But all in all, I'm happy with what I saw."

","Guillermo Del Toro is one of my favourite directors of all time, and for good reason. His films always feel so imaginative, his world building and designs so impressive. He knows how to build everything to create his own vision. Pacific Rim sounds like a stupid concept at first, and while the movie is dumb, it knows how seriously to take itself. Unlike the transformers movies which need to convince the audience that the movie is dark and gritty, this movie has fun, with vibrant colours and fun characters. These characters are not original or very unique but their fun tropes, like Star Wars characters. In fact, I am surprised so many dislike these characters but then love Star Wars. It's probably due to the development of these characters, but I think everyone is fleshed out as much as they need to be. <br/><br/>People consider this a modern Star Wars, and I would have to agree with it. It uses other sources and cliches mixed together to create its unique universe like Star Wars does. This universe doesn't sound so unique, I mean tecchnically theres just giant robots and kaijus now, but all the details Del Toro puts into the universe elevates this world. <br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro of course knows how to deal with special effects, but I was anticipating ths movie due to budget, as Del Toro doesn't typically get a big blockbuster budget, even in the Hellboy movies. This movie looks beautiful, with a wide variety of locations. Again, this is so colourful compared to most blockbusters. This colour makes the film interesting to look at. The inside of the Jaegers, the different Kaijus and the look of the Shatterdome, Hong Kong and the rift are beautiful, <br/><br/>I haven't talked about the action, mostly because surpisingly there isn't a lot in the film, which is what I love. In fact, there are only 3 fights in the movie, the first one not really even counting as a fight, more as an introduction. The 2nd set piece, which I will not spoil to anyone, is by far the highlight of the film. One thing that sets this movie apart from others is the action itself. The Jaegers aren't fast Michael Bay robots, they are slow, and so are they Kaijus. This, combined with the water that is always in these action scenes as rain or waves, gives this feeling of impact by seeing the robots slowly smash water particles rather than zoom across the screen just to look cool. This feeling of scale is just awesome, established in each shot, always making sure the Jaegers feel huge.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is a movie unlike so many blockbusters these days which try to give off this fake seriousness that the movie doesn't need. I wish more movies were like this, and more directors were as talented as Guillermo Del Toro."

","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Some movies are just not what they look like. When I discovered what Pacific Rim was about, I instantly thought ""well, here we go again with another Transformers film but with monsters instead"". However, Guillermo del Toro was the director, so I had to give it a chance. Thankfully, I was extremely surprised! <br/><br/>The main characters are well-developed, each one has a powerful and emotional backstory, plus distinct personalities. Idris Elba is a freaking badass, but the standout of the movie is Rinko Kikuchi. She is incredible and her range of expressions is astounding. Excellent work from Rinko, who elevated her already well-written character. Charlie Hunnam gets a lot of scrutiny from critics, but I usually stand on his side. However, even though he isn't bad, I didn't feel the emotions that he was supposed to transmit in more compelling moments. He doesn't bring the film down, but he also doesn't elevate it.<br/><br/>The story is actually captivating (it even carries some twists that change the course of action) and the action is visually jaw-dropping. I mean, there are Godzilla-like monsters fighting better-designed Transformers and most importantly, del Toro is at the command. Even if he is more used to work with prosthetics, he nails the CGI. Additionally, most of the action is set on water which is known to be a very harsh environment to film decent action. Everything is seamless and there are genuinely creative sequences that left me in awe.<br/><br/>The editing is great and the score is very cool. I love the movie's pacing, it never gets boring when there isn't a fight due to the interesting characters. Their dialogues are meaningful and the consequences of the destruction feel realistic. del Toro's world-building skills are phenomenal, he focused on creating a world where monsters and machines could exist without making it sound forced or stupid. He didn't worry about producing a franchise, he just tried to make a good standalone film and I think he even surprised himself with the final product.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it does have its flaws. While the main characters are remarkable, there are a couple of secondary characters who are extremely annoying. One is always screaming instead of just talking while the other is an exaggerated version of a stereotypical British person. They are even more frustrating because they are linked to an important part of the plot, hence a bigger chunk of screentime with these two. It breaks the tone since we quickly change from a serious moment to a cartoon comedy.<br/><br/>Even though it doesn't feel slow at all, there is a gap between the first fight and the second one that I think is too long. An action-packed 20min go to 40min with pretty much no action whatsoever. Finally, del Toro uses an excess of exposition. The first act is full of narration and everything is just thrown at us. I got to a point where I actually thought ""is this guy still narrating after 15min?"". <br/><br/>All in all, I had a blast with Pacific Rim! It makes me think how Transformers would be like if they were directed by someone more competent. Guillermo del Toro makes the most of his nack for visually stunning action and his world-building skills are intact, as the well-written characters dive in a surprisingly interesting screenplay."
"jamesrupert2014","7","0","0","10 April 2018"," Predictable, cluttered CGI spectacular
","Monsters (""kaiju"") are rising from the ocean floor and mankind's only hope are giant fighting robots (""jaegers""). Formulaic from beginning to end ""Pacific Rim"" is a tour-de-force visual extravaganza backgrounding a predictable, cliché'd story. Much of the imagery moves so quickly that it is difficult to tell what is happening (other than yet another big fight is underway). The ""kaiju"" were sufficiently similar looking and hard to scale that you had to be constantly told that the next one was bigger and badder (and they all looked like they had recently gargled with glowstick liquid). The big mechas were more interesting, with imagery reflecting the pop-culture that popularised the term 'kaiju' (I had 'Voltron' flashbacks), but the constant glare made them difficult to appreciate. The film contains lots of filler (training fights, a side trip to find a kaiju brain, etc) buttressing a minimal story and the script is mostly tough guy posturing, especially at the end, when every character seems to heroically say 'goodbye' several times. As is not uncommon in the genre, the story seemed to be written around the imagery rather than vice-versa, but generally, the state-of-the-art CGI was sufficiently impressive to keep me watching (and rewatching)."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","0","8 April 2018"," Pacific Rim harks back to classic robots versus monsters blockbusters.
","Boom! This is what we all wanted. Colossal mechs punching the blue blood out of enormous beasts. Del Toro presented the sprawling action how he knows best, visual splendour and cinematic showmanship. Now, this is no means perfect in fact I would only say it's good, but I would be lying if I said I don't enjoy it. In the near future, Earth is rapidly becoming ravaged by Kaijus who are spawning from a mysterious teleporter in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. Humans retaliate by building and piloting gargantuan mechanised weapons known as Jaegers. And so we watch the enthralling action gripped to our seats as we shout ""Yeahhhh, punch it, slice it, rip its head off!!"". Del Toro has always been a visual director, and Pacific Rim is another great addition to his filmography. The neon lighting backdrop of Hong Kong where the ensuing battle rages on in the consistent downpour within the city's bay. The glowing venomous blue eyes of the Kaijus as they catastrophically cause chaos through animalistic means. Numerous characters sacrificing themselves and destructively being ripped apart as they attempt to save their world. The stakes are high, and so is the production value. Full marks for visuals, direction and sound editing. Charlie Hunnam may have the physicality as he boisterously waltzes around the Shatterdome as if he owns it, but his acting is as monotonous as a broken metronome. Rinko Kikuchi is just a total babe, and certainly underrated in everything she's in. Idris Elba gives the best speech since 'Independence Day' as he motivates his pilots in ""cancelling the apocalypse"". Everyone else? Functional. Charlie Day plays one of two irritating scientists and consistently annoys the heck out of me with his high pitch squealing. The story is fairly basic with limited surprises, but I'm sure you expected this. The first half is unquestionably slower than the second. However, you wanted titanic combat sequences, and you certainly got them! Monstrous popcorn entertainment, just lacks that extra punch."
"vivaciouscontent","7","0","0","8 April 2018"," Bad acting but stunning visuals
","Bad, bad, I mean, BAD acting. There are times when the Asian chick Mako has some screen time, and honestly, it's very, very cringe worthy. Idris Alba does his best to be a good actor too, but the situation that he's placed in makes him especially impossible to make his acting shine competently (esp. the elevator scene. I'll say nothing more.). With that being sad, what really saves this film are the visuals. I mean wawaweewa. The movements of the jaegers. The way they move are so realistic that you feel their enormity, their crushing gravity within you as you watch this film. It's as if you're actually there, which is what makes this film so awesome (visually)! And then there's this one scene where... I won't say anything more because I won't give it away, but trust me. When you see the film, you'll never forget it. The image will stick with you to the grave. I'll just give you one clue: sunlight. Boom. That's it. Anyhow, there are times, however, when the film makes you feel that cheap props and super fake-as-hell stuff are being used. Maybe Hollywood was cutting corners OR Guillermo needs to find himself other artists who decorate his scenes, fabricate the non-cgi equipments, and so forth. Those annoying knick knacks really killed the film. But other than that, the visuals. For those alone, the film is worth 7 stars."

","There's this niggling yet unshakeable sense that 'Pacific Rim (2013)' shouldn't be as enjoyable as it ultimately is, seeing as though the dialogue (along with most acting) is eye-rollingly ham-fisted, in a corny kind of way, and the set-up itself is cringe-inducingly clichéd. Yet the picture picks itself up around half-way through and comes barrelling in to be an ultimate guilty-pleasure. The expertly rendered robot-suits battle it out in the cities and seas to usually eye-pleasing results, and it's actually a pretty fun ride even though you know it's stupid, and perhaps it even knows it itself. Not quite 'turn-your-brain-off', but definitely 'ignore-that-whiny-voice-of-cinematic-reason'. 7/10"

"kevinoneil-99062","10","0","0","25 March 2018"," Everything done right.
","This film does everything completely right. Everything that the other monster vs robot movies get wrong.
The robots aren't hiding in dark lighting there isn't massive amounts of lens flare there isn't cut after cut to hide crappy fight scenes.
The fight scenes are actually amazing and have great attention to detail with what is happening punch after punch.
You wonder why the EMP Kaiju doesn't EMP again? Because Gyspy clearly rips the EMP generating part of the Kaiju off in a fight scene.
Being able to actually give us substance and detail in a fight scene is what all these other movies constantly lack.
The details put into this film make it amazing, Guillermo Del Toro did wonders with this, he put passion into this.<br/><br/>Which is why it's so sad to see the sequel be given over to the kind of people that would say ""I wish the robots would hurry up, just hurry up."" said by Boyega the lead actor.
Why not just star in a transformers film?<br/><br/>""The actor admits that he found the movements of the original Jaegers a little too cumbersome, and has brought fight co-ordinator Liang Yang over from Star Wars: Rogue One and The Force Awakens to bring the aforementioned ""martial arts feel"" to Uprising.""<br/><br/>Way to ruin parts of what made the original film so great. Why take your time with anything? This is what Hollywood does over and over. Rush projects, no passion.
From the characters, the feel of the movie the music this movie just tells you that time was spent on it, that love went into it.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro made these mechs lumbering towering giants and perfectly sold us the illusion of how big they actually are.
They aren't going to do spin flips unless someone makes a sequel and thinks it's transformers.. Which unfortunatly happened.<br/><br/>Being a movie that gives attention to detail to the world it is set in is wonderful, we don't get that in a lot of movies. From Kaiju harvesting to black market Kaiju scamming powders to boost your sex life and the opening credits talking about how the world reacted to Kaiju's appearing. Everything is spot on in this film and shows how a film should be done.<br/><br/>I saw the trailers before it came out and said ""Oh no not another Transformers.""

"gcsman","7","0","0","18 March 2018"," B-movie material in the hands of an A-list director
","I didn't ever get to the theater to see this, but my daughter insisted we should watch it on her DVD copy just this month. Sure enough it's (a) completely stereotypical for big smash-'em-up SF action films with giant monsters and robots, and (b) somehow (and I'm still not sure how exactly) vastly more fun than the dreary Transformers movies that it invites comparison with. Some pro reviewers say it's because there's a good, well developed dose of human interest that the Transformers lack. I think that's part of it -- the three principals played by Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and (stunningly beautiful) Rinko Kikuchi are engaging and worth rooting for -- but somehow that's not all. Director Guillermo del Toro just knows his way around a scene and how to stich them together into a sweeping narrative. <br/><br/>Of course there are gaping holes in the logic. Nothing much stands to reason if you look at it closely. As one example, every one of the Kaiju (alien monster) vs. Jaeger ( human-piloted giant warrior bot) battles happens in or near large cities where massive destruction and carnage can and does ensue. If this has been going on for years now as the plot says, why in h*** is anyone at all still living in coastal cities like Hong Kong or San Francisco? But without that, the fight scenes just wouldn't be as photogenic. <br/><br/>Never mind. The bottom line is that this is B-movie material in the hands of an A-list director who has made it rise above its limitations, at least for the time you're watching. One wonders what the filmmakers of the original 1950's monster movies (Godzilla, Rodan, and the rest) would have made of this. At very least they'd have envied all the CGI tools that can be mobilized today."

"Screen_Blitz","9","0","0","17 August 2017"," Guillermo Del Toro's combination of cutting-edge special effects, dazzling plot, and spectacular scenery make for an explosive good time
","The best way to describe this science-fiction action piece would be a cross between 'Transformers' and 'Godzilla'. And when adding the ingredients of eye-feasting special effects, a solid plot, and Guillermo Del Toro's cutting-edge visual compulsion, your final product is an explosively entertaining thrill ride that works in more ways than one. Guillermo Del Toro, the man who gifted us with cinematic hits such as 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'Hellboy' and its sequel, knows how to keep things and does so in many ways many directors of both of the action and sci-fi genre neglect nowadays. And that is establishing a firmly even balance of explosive action set pieces and visual integrity while not letting lose on the film's narrative standpoint. His vision of giant robots battling toe-to-toe against a hideous Godzilla-like monsters work in a way that allows moviegoers to admire his dazzling directorial style while shoving popcorn in their mouths as the explosive scenery that fires on screen. There is a lot to be experienced from witnessing the major cities crumbled on a grand scale in the heat of a battle between two giant monsters fighting head-to-head, more so than just watching things go BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! This film centers around a world between the human race and an enormous alien creature known as the Kaiju who has launched an invasion that has devastated millions of lives across the lives. With mankind on the brink of extinction, its last line of defense comes at the hands of former pilot Raleigh Becket (played by Charlie Hunnam) and an inexperience pilot Maki Mori (played by Rinko Kikuchi) who arm themselves inside a giant mechanical mecha known as the Jaeger in attempt to defeat the Kaiju, with Marshal Stacker Pentecost (played by Idris Alba) in command. <br/><br/>Unlike filmmakers like Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich, Guillermo Del Toro doesn't believe in soaking the audiences with explosive shock and awe factor with cutting-edge special effects, he also injects a heart the midst of the action. This includes blessing the characters with an arc and supporting the action with a story that firmly makes sense. In return, the film holds a gift with more than an escapist action extravaganza. Over his past works, Del Toro boasted an solid visual methodology that can only be described as unforgettable, and his style makes his return back here, only without the macabre sort of look demonstrated in 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The main military base where all the non-action takes place is beautiful look at, sporting a dazzling futuristic look. But, unsurprisingly, it is the sequences in which the two main characters Raleigh and Mako step into the Jaegers and battle against the Kaiju that marks the film's peaks. The big action sequence surrounding the destruction of downtown Hong Kong is electrifying and makes for a nice treat for the action junkies to snack on. Building exploding and disintegrating into a million pieces, what is there not to be fond about? And it is thanks to cinematographer Guillermo Navarro who captures the action with stellar integrity and not with the vexing quick cuts and shaky cam to obscure the heat of the action. Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi on the other hand, turn in some okay performances. But they are definitely no match for Idris Alba who stands with not only at the best performance in the crowd but the most solid character arc. Hunman and Kikuchi, however, are at least more tolerable than Charlie Day as the spastic scientist showers who's jittery behavior grows less an less funny as the film goes on, and Ron Perlman who serves as the supporting comic relief but is given very little to do. It comes show though, that not everyone is in for the gold. <br/><br/>Pacific Rim is a thrillingly entertaining sci-fi action vehicle helmed by the intriguing directorial efforts of Guillermo Del Toro and his gift for visual spectacle and patent for feeding the audiences for an engaging collage of special-effects action with a heart and soul. This film does not aim for anything groundbreaking, but that doesn't matter because as a whole, the film is a lot of fun."

","Some movies are deep. Some movies are intellectual. Some movies are moving, life changing and then there's movies like Pacific Rim. The very concept is so ludicrously stupid that it shouldn't be seen by anyone who considers themselves to be remotely intelligent. But then there are movies that are developed for the intention of pure entertainment. Pacific Rim is one of those movies and boy is it entertaining! Giant monsters called Kaiju emerge from a portal under the Pacific Ocean and rise up to destroy humankind. In retaliation we develop giant skyscraper sized robots called Jaegers to fight against the colossal beasts. I did warn you that the story was ludicrous! Piloted by two humans as their minds are blended together the Jaegers prove effective at slaying the Kaiju until the tables suddenly turn. Come on, this movie isn't going to win any Oscars for acting or compelling storytelling but for sheer spectacle this is about as big as it t gets. Observe this movie in 3D with booming surround sound and I dare you not to get caught up in the moment. I reviewed Jurassic Park recently and said in that review that nothing wowed us anymore in terms of SFX. I was wrong! The battle scenes and CGI creations in this movie are jaw dropping. So good that you are immediately transformed back into a 8 year old child again. When I said earlier in this review that this film should not be seen by anyone with a brain...

","This film has supported the idea that one man's meat is another's poison. It either drew total pans or rave reviews, but there were precious few objective views. Therein in lies the paradox that defines how we watch movies, and why reviewer opinions can be such opposite valuations. Like most problematic counterpoint of this nature, the truth lies somewhere in between.<br/><br/>To further this point, I have to say that this is neither real blockbuster material nor is it cinematic roadkill. Depending on your viewpoint, the extent to which you are willing to suspend your disbelief, you will find both decent watching and you'll also find some wooden acting. There evaluations need to be viewed in light of their era of filmdom, the climate within which certain types of movie flourish while others wither and die.<br/><br/>This brings me to one main focus of objective reviewing, the era of the film making and date of release. In the most recent era, there were many movies created by basing them on comic book characters and cartoon characters that can firmly establish how entrenched this kind of movie watching has been. This film fits right into that categorization.<br/><br/>With this in mind, watching this movie comes in a feel-good, heroes beat villains comic book environment time and truly ""belongs"". You can find a ton of fun things to watch but not a lot of top-notch acting, which is in line with the straight ahead Dick Tracy School of Drama prevalent in these flicks. The movie supplies much to look at, achieving a grainy graphics-in-reality seen often in comics. It achieves a moody, dark and ""day-glo"" colored atmosphere sustained quite well all through the show.<br/><br/>The characterizations are broadly drawn. The cast interacts buts seldom acts. The stilted hero personified profile is invoked freely, reminiscent of Steven Segal, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris. Each character gets to be stoic. The relationships are kept simple, as is the dialogue. This basically does not allow the cast much opportunity to chew up the scenery. It also lends itself an unspoken tension, which aids in maintaining the comic book atmosphere <br/><br/>The protagonists, the Kaiju, are right out of the Godzilla and Ultraman early anime efforts. This has a funky throwback feel, sometimes working effectively and sometimes silly looking. The heroes, the paired occupant humans operating the good guys Jaeger robots, are flat out Transformers (and, no, not in disguise!), yet another Saturday morning kids show evoked. The fights between the opposing entities can be cool to watch, but there are too many of them. Or, should I say, there are too many because of the length of the film.<br/><br/>The movie clocks in at about three hours. It's too long. As aforementioned, there are too many fights, too many one-upmanship ultimate battles to keep continued interest. As is the fate of many an action movie, it's prolonged state eats away at the dynamic tension. That being said, the real ""final"" fight is worthy of the effects put into it, as a pastiche of graphics, anime and physical interaction provide some eye candy at the end of the show.<br/><br/>I often purposefully look at films such as this because of the wide range of opinion provoked by it. I almost always find the real truth lies between. Depending upon your ability to suspend that feeling of disbelief, you can enjoy this one. I like to go to movie theaters because the majority of the viewers there are more willing to take things as they're given. They are predisposed to feeling that way, that is what draws many of us to the theater. However, I watched this at home. It was a pleasant enough pastime for a chilly February afternoon. Please forgive any badly spelled words or names. Happy viewing!"

","*** Spoilers ***<br/><br/>It is an alright movie. The action is great, although this is probably the only reason this movie is good. The main character, Raleigh, was very boring and had no chemistry with the supporting character, Mako. He seemed arrogant, despite the movies intentions to show him as otherwise. Also the fact that he was the only one who seemed to be able to kill the Category 4+ Kaijus which seemed a bit unrealistic because it made Gypsy be able to kill two (category 4) Kaijus when three of the next best Jaegars all either died or stopped working. And yes, the pilots that didn't speak English all died. In fact I think I would had preferred Raleigh's brother being the main character because he was much more likable rather than just trying to look cool all the time. All in all it was enjoyable to watch, but it lacked the depth you need in a good movie, not intellectual by far, but fun to watch if you don't actually absorb the back story... or Raleigh."

","I only watched this movie because of Guillermo Del Toro, hoping for a new Starship Troopers, but sadly, where Verhoeven succeeded brilliantly Del Toro failed miserably. I was hoping for a great spoof on the Godzilla-geek culture. A movie to make fun of said movies, the pathetic/flatulent nationalistic-army-kitsch and of Hollywood altogether behind a mask of a sci-fi action movie. Sometimes, for a few seconds (e.g. the black-market) I had hope, but it was lost to end up in a deluge of clichés and cinematic commonplaces. <br/><br/>Verhoeven put the viewer in the skin of a fascist and he made them want to be one. In a fascist society you take the part of the fascist or the bugs. And given that no human can identify themselves with insects, you had to a be fascist. There were many-many details that were great, that had some deeper meaning, but I won't go deeper here, because this is a review about Pacific Rim. The actors were weak, but again in Starship Troopers, there were only one actor in leading role, Michael Ironside. The others were only bioscenery (Denise Richards, Casper Van Dien). Here we had Idris Elba, the others were only models, part of the decoration. (Yes, Ron Perlman and Santiago Segura, but they were not in leading roles). <br/><br/>So I was waiting for something that just did not come. The visuals were stunning, but boring: you see these monster/robots in every game/movie/tutorial, etc. A lot of work for nothing. <br/><br/>It is amazing how a bland and bloodless movie like Pacific Rim can attain a score above 3, but now it is on 7. No hope for humanity, let them kaijus come..."

","From the first time I heard of this movie it was clear to me that it would mainly be a movie for the cgi effects. And yes, they are pretty neat, for me reason enough to watch it. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is, well below average. Do not expect the battles to be believable, it's more as if some nine year old kid had decided on what scenes should appear. Possibly a nine year old with a very good relation to his brother... because everything is about doing things together with your brother in this movie. There are some major letdowns, such as a robot controlled by three brothers, that should have a special fighting style utilizing three arms, but it never does anything you couldn't do with two arms. <br/><br/>The jokes in the movie are really lame, more something kids would enjoy. <br/><br/>The acting itself isn't too bad, I actually like fact that the movie does not used major blockbuster stars. I always find that refreshing and also a brave step for any movie maker. Also the fact that the girl in the main role is an average looking woman instead of some unrealistically hot Barby makes the movie a little more sympathetic, kudos to that. <br/><br/>My favorite part is clearly the guest appearance of the voice of GlaDOS, but only gamers will notice that."
"m_dielingen","4","0","0","7 September 2014"," Looks great..story and acting not so much
","Visually amazing but it's not a very good movie. The story is very weak, acting was mediocre with very bad dialogues. A couple of decades ago I'd totally love this movie especially with all the Japanese influences. There's action, a bit gruesome at times but thankfully these aliens don't bleed red. I was planning not to have several anime, 80/90ties cartoons or Japanese monster movies flashbacks while watching this but that ended up being difficult to ignore.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has a beautiful creative mind but I don't see how this movie has a director. The movie has so much cgi in it, it's completely made by the story-boarders, editors and cgi tech guys. I can see someone being an art director guiding movies of this sort but the concept of directing a movie is totally lost in movies like this. And since it's not such a great movie I can't even say it's well directed.<br/><br/>Online cgi artists complain that some of the stories tend to be weak giving them a bad name but I don't see how the people who are suppose to write good stories get paid enough since all the money is needed for the cgi!<br/><br/>But anyway if you are looking for an sci-fi monster action flick and are not much concerned about the quality of the storyline. Then watch it! I like the Japanese influences, the visual works, sci-fi in general so it's hard for me not to watch any type of sci-fi movie (especially the dystopia type) LOL. But the story is really weak and some of the acting made my toes curl."

","So much has been written, said and uttered about this mammoth production of a blockbuster. Pacific Rim seems to be a very promising try, as it starts where Godzilla or even Independence Day have stopped. With better funds, greater video effects, bigger sound, decent actors, huge soundtrack, excellent funny parts of two zany professors, this movie could have achieved a real great point. In some ways, it did. In many, it failed. With all the efforts, there are still may open questions dangling in the air. I will not ask them to create Spoilers, so still, some plot holes remain. The formulaic performance of several actors add to a weaker impression, and rather predictable twists of plot make it duller thing to peruse. There is much of a clichéd pathetic speaking, much of predictable development, and still, some questions were never answered. One can watch this movie once, just to get to know this one, but then luckily forget and never come back to this at all."

","The movie is solid and a very entertaining action flick. But it falls short on characters, not because there is too little plot but because there is too much cramped into the whole thing. And considering they are planning a sequel, I question why they didn't go for a trilogy in the first place. The story arc is compelling and the character development could be intriguing if it got some room to play out. But like it is, everything feels rushed and half baked. It's pretty much like Ender's Game. For me a great movie has time to show action, tell a good story and let characters engage the viewers thru the relationships between them - if they can't do it in 1 movie than go ahead and make it 2 or 3 movies. But when you go for such a first part and then try to sell me a sequel, I feel short changed."

But as a result very little attention is spent on the storyline, it shallowly consists of 'mad' but brilliant of course larger than life (over acted) scientist characters plus warriors (soldiers) some with the utmost integrity and some just 'bad ass'. Basically good guys V bad guys but both on the same side... ""Who will save the world?"".... Q internal wrangles and corridor scuffles over who has the best idea....

","I'm not one to spoil movies because as a movie fan I hate that myself so if you are wanting to know what happens, then you are reading the wrong review. Overall a good concept and a good movie that deserved a 6/10. The biggest thing that annoyed me was that if you are going to have a part in the movie where you want an Australian accent (and being an Australian this is something that really bugs me) get someone who is actually from Australia, as I'm sure you are aware of all the actors/actresses that have come from down under. Its not that the acting was bad although it wouldn't win an Oscar, but the put on Australian accent was awful, it just doesn't sound natural, and that is part of being able to act and make it believable. The Idea of aliens invading earth was not a new idea but the way they went about it was and thats the main reason I gave it more than a 5 because they took an old idea and breathed some new life into it, the special effects were done well although will all Sci-Fi's any movie buff will pick it apart. So over all a good movie with a good idea but one that I will probably only watch once."

Needless to say the special effects were a high note, the robots were kind of bland, but the monsters were very convincing. Also the some of the story was interesting, specifically the original Gotham-like gangster setup. The supporting cast was to be commended, specifically Charlie Day and Idris Elba were very good in their roles.<br/><br/>The Bad Part, the lead! Seriously, it seems like it is so hard to get a decent leading role in action films these days! Charlie Hunnam was pretty much terrible. What is wrong with directors these days who can't see that putting several 100's of millions of dollars into a move, and getting a crappy lead is a bad thing? Especially from the likes of Del Toro. Plus the story itself, while starting strong, was way to unoriginal and slow for my liking! An average film at best."

","Director Guillermo Del Toro is a big fan of robots or more correctly Jaegers, colossal metal beings controlled by two pilots within the machine itself, locked in a ""neural bridge"".<br/><br/>The Jaeger program was created in response to the arrival of Kaiju, gigantic sea monsters popping out of fissures in the ocean at regular intervals. Kaiju are bad, very bad, Godzilla on super steroids with added attitude, they will ruin everyone's day unless they can be stopped.<br/><br/>Earth is not doing so well, Kaiju are winning more often than not and the Jaeger program is losing favour and political backing, with crews being killed and robots destroyed.<br/><br/>Humanity decides that building walls to keep the invaders out is better option, which seems odd bearing in mind the ease with which walls seem to get breached.<br/><br/>No matter, we get to meet Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Haufman), a washed up ex-pilot who lost his older brother in battle, despite their celebrity status during the good old days, when the war was going humanity's way.<br/><br/>Of course, following the requisite ""Earth needs you"" speech from the commanding officer (Idris Elba), we are back in business. This time with rookie pilot Mako Mori (Kikuchi), whose only qualification appears to be appealing to particular demographic and loyal Asian fan base. Local dialogue, with English subtitles indicates the contribution overseas box office now represents. We also have a nod to China, Russia and Australia to cover all the bases, no pun intended.<br/><br/>Various obstacles are thrown in the new teams path, before they are allowed to go into battle and there are very few surprises worked into the formulaic screenplay. Throw in a couple of scientists attempting to mind meld with the Kaiju and a barely bothering to act Ron Perlman as a bizarre collector of Kaiju parts and you realise the train marked reality left some time ago.<br/><br/>So with only Elba troubling the ""A-List"" star wattage meter and with a story cobbled together from a thousand fevered Manga and Anime dreams, the special effects needed to be top notch.<br/><br/>Here the film does not disappoint, making ""Transformers"" look like the toys they really are and with a scale that is simply breathtaking. Building size robots dragging cargo ships to use as clubs to beat the oversized lizards into submission.<br/><br/>Subtle, the film is not.<br/><br/>Is it fun, to a point yes. If the subject matter interests you, then there is plenty of spectacle here and the CGI is state of the art. Dialogue is risible, apart from one line which is likely to bring more giggles than any patriotic response.<br/><br/>Add an extra star if you are under 30, have enjoyed alcohol and are watching with friends.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>Provided you are looking for a movie where giant robots and sea monsters engage in WWF smackdown bouts, there is much to enjoy.<br/><br/>If you are looking for depth, story and believable human interaction, then move swiftly along."

","Pacific Rim is a must see for all fans of action. From the first frame to the last the action only ever stops for a short period of time. When the action does slow down it is for back story which was perfectly timed and placed throughout the movie. The visuals never disappoint and the acting was spot on. There was drama when there needed to be, comedy when there needed to be and intensity that only made it better. I give the cast and crew a big hand for their work making this movie what it came to be. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer. Some movie-goers might say that 2 hours and 11 minutes is more than enough time. However, this movie grabs you and brings you into the world of monsters and machines and makes you want to stay.

","I have been an avid fan of sci-fi action movies ever since I first saw Star Wars back in 1977. Watching Pacific Rim gave me the same feeling that I had when I was 7 and saw that movie. Pacific Rim is epic in scale, story, visuals, and sound like Star Wars, Aliens, Jurassic Park, the Matrix and Avatar before it. I compare it to these giants of science fiction because thats where Pacific Rim belongs.<br/><br/>My jaw dropped at the scale, at the amazingly realistic action scenes. The musical score was heroic and inspiring, unique and memorable. I cheered, I gasped, I was completely enthralled in this movie beginning to end. I saw images unlike anything I had ever seen before and I was deeply saddened when it was over. This is a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>There has never been a movie like this one, at least regarding subject matter. I suppose it took Hollywood technology this long to get to the point where they could make a Japanese Anime movie like Robotech or Evangelion in a realistic manner.<br/><br/>The Kaiju were monstrous, threatening and never once did I think that the Jaeger would just walk up and kill the thing with one punch like the Hulk. These Kaiju were a real threat, mostly bigger than our own titanic robotic Jaegers and often throughout the movie I knew that the pilots were in true peril. Each fight was a work of art, never shying away from the blood. This is no bloodless superhero romp, but a gritty visceral experience that is terrifying and thrilling.<br/><br/>There were great lines, great shout-outs to classic movies, and great likable characters. The plot took you everywhere you could hope for and then some. Events happened that I had absolutely no expectation of, amazing things that I will not spoil for you.<br/><br/>I sit here now wondering how long it will be before I can go see it again, or buy a copy so I can put it on and play it all day long. I thank you Mr. Deltoro for creating something so astounding. I hope this is only the beginning of a series."

Gigantic Robots. Check. Gigantic Alien Monsters. Triple Check (They have a whole army of those on the other side). A bit campy but perfectly placed drama. Check.

End of the world as we know it. Double Check. Humans always win. Triple Check. Tons of explosive stuff. A million Checks. Sci-Fi FX at it's peak. Gazillion Checks. Okay, maybe some of the scientific stuff in this could be hogwash, ask Michio Kaku, but who cares, right? It's a ""Sci-Fi Fantasy"" movie! Who cares! Pacific Rim delivers the epic of epics no other blockbuster has achieved. The robots in this movie makes ""Transformers"" look like kindergarten kids sucking on a lollipop. Exponential city destruction that stomps all of the ""Godzilla"" movies, western and eastern combined. Fresh talent uprising. I know some of these new talents, but this will surely propel them to the top further than they have dreamed of. Huge bases that makes G.I. Joe a joke. Idris Elba, you nailed it. Ron Perlman, you never seize to amaze me. Guillermo del Toro has broken every disaster movie ever created (because I know there will be more from where this came from). The size of these robots and monsters makes the Mythology Titans and Greek God movies like an ugly spasm. This movie has gobbled up every alien invasion movie ever made like they were marsh mallows. Avengers was awesome yeah, but the aliens here makes them look like a bunch of girl scouts trick or treating. Now the movies ""Pacific Rim"" has run over aren't bad, they are blockbusters and epics too in their own right and in their own time. But, like I said, Pacific Rim has run over them like they were ants. Now for the final blow. This goes out to the makers of the movie ""Cloverfield"" in 2006. Listen up. This is how an epic monster movie should always be made. Not told from the point of view of a small group of stupid kids. Oh sorry, they weren't supposed to be kids. Yeah, but they sure looked like a bunch of stupid kids to me. Told from a point of view of a shaky cam found footage? Are you kidding me? With all the hype you guys marketed Cloverfield, it just didn't justify the hype. If you're gonna make a Cloverfield sequel (I know you are), make sure you won't fall flat from our expectations. Do it right next time. We're watching you. Movie goers, learn from this movie. Don't get ripped off by others. This is how an epic of epic monster movie should always be made. Now I would be outraged if Pacific Rim won't win a ton of awards for its awesomeness. To me you are on the top of every epic movie ever made. Till your next epic, Guillermo. A Pacific Rim sequel? You're the man! Nuff said."

For 2 hours I was told a story- I wasn't bombarded with product ads, lame pop-culture jokes or ""tested well"" extra plot lines that muddy a film. At no point did Rihanna or JT appear. The plot is simple, clean and precise. Even the tangents and science fiction suspensions that get overly complex are tightly controlled and reigned in well. The narration is effectively used to quickly set up the film without bogging us down in needless back story. The characters are simple & effective. Nobody is complex just for the sake of being complex. The writing is also very simple- but again, it really works. I didn't have to make an effort to enjoy this movie. I didn't try to figure out what vapid point the director was trying to force down our throats- instead I watched robots smash monsters, the good guys being good and the bad guys being evil and scary.

Pacific Rim has outstanding visual effects, great camera angles, and awesome battles. *spoiler alert* I was a little surprised when Yancy Beckett got torn out of the Jaeger named Gypsy Danger. *end of spoiler alert* There were a few mistakes throughout the film, like how other people besides Stacker Pentecost had nose bleeds for no apparent reason. It could have been explained, but I just didn't catch it. This was nothing that ruined the film, though. Also, the score of the movie was fantastic. They played it at just the right times. It was composed of only maybe 5 different notes, but hey, so was Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Now, the dialogue was a little cheesy, also nothing that ruined the film. It was pretty much pep talk, but, it was nothing bad. The makers of the film also knew when to add in a little bit of humor. You would think to find this type of comedy in low budget action comedies, but it was made better. I myself thought del Toro took a risk with this film, and I was surprised at how good it was. I am kind of disappointed that this film made less money than Grown Ups 2. Really people? Who goes to see Grown Ups 2 but not this? I was very surprise when I found this out. Let me think, am I forgetting anything? Oh! This movie was still great without all the big name actors (except Ron Perlman and Charlie Day).

With Pacific Rim (watched on IMAX 3D) you are strapped into the directors personal roller-coaster and take a 2 hour ride through the most spectacular film I have ever seen. Everyone knows that IMAX is great and IMAX 3D is even better but for films like this it is essential to see it in this high spec format. The Mechas are piloted by two people inside the command center and it felt like the director was trying to get you the audience member to step inside his mind and his film and he achieves this spectacularly well. I don't want to get into the film in case I drop any spoilers but all I would say is that the trailers don't really do the film justice. Yes there are robots and monsters but there is a serious human interest story running throughout and while none of it is original it is all believable and mesmerising. Don't see the trailer and think, ""big robots and monsters are for kids"" , the fate of the planet is at stake here people!! Check out the featurettes on YouTube relating to the Mechas and the Monsters, it is well worth it. In summary, this film fully immerses you in a Giant Mecha while you battle fantastic monsters and save the world. What more could you want?"

Pacific Rim is a tribute to those old films. The effects are incredible, they don't look fake or phony CGI like your always seeing.

","Watch out- Pacific Rim is out to blow your minds with its awesomeness. Do you remember the time when as a kid you used to smash action figures and other toys together, imagining momentous battle scenes in your mind? Do you remember Johnny Socko and his flying robot, or more recently- Godzilla? What if the most creatively nerdy director in the world decides to pander the child in you and dish out 2 uninhibited hours of monsters vs robots big bash? The result- a summer blockbuster that stamps out all other blockbusters.<br/><br/>""We always thought alien life would come from the stars, but it came from deep beneath the sea. A portal between dimensions in the Pacific Ocean""<br/><br/>A speedy prologue sets up the background- the Kaiju are alien monsters that are emerging from a deep sea inter dimensional portal. Using nuclear weapons against them will cause too much collateral damage, so the humans design towering 25 story robots called jaegers (means hunter in German) to take on the kaiju. The jaegers are piloted by two individuals connected neurally through a technology called as Drift, wherein they share memories and experiences. At first the jaeger program is successfully, the pilots gain celebrity status. But the kaiju get bigger and smarter, begin to adapt, and win the battles. The world leaders deem the jaeger program to be a failure and begin to build walls to fortify the coastal cities. Rayleigh (Charlie Hunnam) is a retired jaeger pilot who lost his brother when fighting a particularly nasty kaiju. His commander Marshall Stacker Pentacost (Idris Elba) convinces him to come out of retirement for a last ditch effort to destroy the portal once and for all. His new partner is Mako Mori, an exceptionally talented pilot with a painful past. The movie is about dealing with survivor guilt and moving on after a loss- both Mako and Rayleigh must learn to pilot their robot Gypsy Danger with flamboyance and passion to save the world.<br/><br/>No big stars, no introspective or quip happy superheroes, no literary source, not a sequel- how then does Pacific Rim tower over a summer full of blockbusters? Three words- Guillermo del Toro. This vividly imaginative director literally breathes life into the visuals through his eye for detail, and in one fell scoop he has not only resurrected the giant monster genre, but also finally ensured that Hollywood paid homage to Godzilla (rest in peace, Roland Emmerich's 1998 Godzilla!), mashing it up with modern tech-no sheen with visual impact that eschews current Transformerish blurry action in favor of crisp and clear widescreen shots that are mind-boggling in impact, such as when a jaeger clubs a kaiju with an ocean liner, or when a kaiju flies off with a jaeger in its claws only to have itself decapitated mid air with a giant sword. Every frame is beautifully shot- the bone crunching impact when metal meets flesh, or the gorgeous detailing of the robots and monsters. The robots have the personalities and actions reminiscent of their country and pilots- so the one from China is like a little martial art fighter, the Russian is a behemoth brawler, and the Australian looks like a rugby player. The monsters though have been a del Toro trademark all his life, whether it is Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy or Cronos. You have kaiju of all shapes, sizes and kinds- reptilian, crustacean, insectoid. If one lumbers around like a gorilla, another slithers around like a Chinese dragon, and the biggest one resembles a biblical, horned demon.<br/><br/>A movie as loud and bombastic as Pacific Rim does not really leave much scope for acting. Having said that an eclectic cast largely does the job. Charlie Hunnan is serviceable as the lead but plays a clichéd character, Rinko Kikuchi is the emotional core and also brings in the Japanese angle, Idris Elba looks a million bucks and carries himself exactly like the man you want in charge when facing a monster invasion, an over the top Charlie Day and Ron Perlman bring on the requisite laughs.<br/><br/>Bridges are destroyed, cities are leveled, and skyscrapers are shattered, and this is even before the opening credits. I could go on and on describing each scene in detail, but there is the thing about beauty- its best seen, not read. Go on and experience a sensory overload for yourself. Call it eye candy, call it popcorn entertainment, call it summer extremism, or simply call it what all movies were always meant to be- glorious fun. Unmissable."

","The real summer blockbuster of 2013, and when it comes to the ""big and monstrous"" Pacific Rim dwarfs anything ever produced by the likes of ""The Avengers"" or any other big-budget extravaganza.<br/><br/>Film uses a very basic plot—heroes defending the planet against invading aliens coming through an undersea portal between our world and another dimension. Del Toro reintroduces Kaiju—monolithic monsters (such as Godzilla) wrecking havoc on the planet, and mankind's only defense against them, Jaeger—kind of ostentatiously large version of Iron Man armor controlled neutrally by a human pilot, the evolved versions use two pilots sharing the neural load by psychically bridging their minds through a technique called ""drifting"".<br/><br/>Loaded with some ultra-cool weaponry (like Plasma gun, Rocket Elbow, Missile Launcher, Hammer) Jaeger's best was indeed the good, old Sword--only a tad bigger! The two scenes with swordplay—one mid-air, one underwater—simply blow you away, would have loved seeing more of it—hopefully in the upcoming sequel!<br/><br/>A lot of films tried capturing the 'grandiose' of comics or graphic novels—especially the colossal alien villains—but it is Del Toro who has hit the mark closest, yet. Jaeger's designs, including its gait, movement and fights were perfect in all its grandeur. Kaiju could use little more refinement/clarity when it comes to dark and shady underwater scenes. <br/><br/>In all, Pacific Rim has raised the bar very high when it comes to spectacularly grand designs and visual effects—Del Toro accomplished his vision on screen by collaborating with some proved artists of the field.<br/><br/>His coterie included: robot and monster designers Wayne Barlowe, Oscar Chichoni, David Meng and Simon Lee, and Francisco Ruiz Velasco, famed for Hellboy II and The Hobbit. Special effects were handled by John Knoll and Hal T. Hickel ( Star Wars d Pirates of the Caribbean), Shane Mahan (Iron Man), John Rosengrant (Real Steel) and Clay Pinney (Independence Day, Star Trek). No wonders the awesomeness that transpired on on screen was a visual treat like never before.<br/><br/>Even though a second fiddle, the star cast delivers as it was expected to. Idris Elba was impressive as a hard-boiled leader, Charlie Day and Ron Perlman provide the much needed gags at the right moments and Charlie Hunnam looked good too(perhaps his meatiest role since Green Street Hooligans). <br/><br/>Calls for a definite theater watch!<br/><br/>8.1/10"
"socrates99","9","4","12","13 July 2013"," Good, very well executed homage to Godzilla like monster films
","As much as I enjoy action, I have to say that the 5 most important roles here were perfectly cast; every one of them couldn't have been improved on. There's the fighter who lost his brother, the female Japanese orphan who wants revenge, the highly focused task force commander directing all operations and two high strung researchers running shotgun on the whole thing. These last two almost steal the show several times and that's amazing considering all that's going on.<br/><br/>Charlie Hunman as Raleigh and Rinko Kikuchi as Mako had to make their mental and physical pairing look real (and plausible) to make it all work and they do. Probably for me the weakest part of the movie was the CGI which is state of the art and impressive, but still a little too artificial; it sometimes feels as if you're watching an animated comic book. But the ideas are big, different and fun to follow. What if we were attacked by giant creatures from another dimension? Could we cope? This really fanciful story must have seemed impossible to film at first blush and it's really very impressive that Guillermo Del Toro pulled it off with such apparent success.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing for every young boy out there, especially, though my wife and I enjoyed it as well."
"canada_rocks3000","9","4","12","13 July 2013"," A truly awesome film, spectacular in almost every way.
","The year is 2025 and for the 12 years humankind has been fighting Kaiju (monstrous creatures) that have entered the world through a portal in the Pacific Rim ocean floor. To fight these monsters humanity created monsters of their own, the Jaegers (giant mechs controlled by two pilots) but despite the world's best joint efforts the years of increasing attacks have pushed humans to the brink of extinction. Making one last stand the world's remaining Jaeger forces assemble for the ultimate battle of survival.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Guillermo del Toro and Travis Beacham based on the story by Beacham is a little cliché' and clunky but does deliver some highly emotional scenes and dialogue. The story is simple and has some pacing issues but still entertaining and interesting. The movie does a great job of explaining some of Pacific Rim's deep lore and mythology but you can feel there is still so much more to be discovered. It falls into the group I find with most movies that are origin stories or have a deep lore that is crucial to the story (like Inception), because there is so much to explain most of the story is spent doing just that. It in no way makes it a bad film it just left me wanting to know and experience more. Yes I am advocating for a sequel already, which I guess is what the producers and film companies want.<br/><br/>The human cast for the most part are great. Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket though a bit wooden in parts still has shines in pivotal scenes, Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori brings an innocence but deep strength to her role making her a great female movie character and Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost is the stand out bringing a real gravitas to his character's words and actions. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as Dr. Newton Geiszler and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb, respectively bring the most comic relief as frenemy scientists working to understand the Kaiju. Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau is an outlandish character bringing a bit of flair and humor to a role that is mostly a cameo. My biggest problem with the film is the casting of Herc and Chuck Hansen. The character's story and personality, are great and added another layer to the film's story. It is the fact that two Australian characters were played by an American and a Englishman (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky, who are great and do their best) using dodgy accents, it can be distracting. It feels like a missed opportunity to cast two of the many great Australian actors in these roles.<br/><br/>The real stars of course are the Jaegers and Kaiju, the designs and details are fantastic. The Jaegers are hulking mechs that look bad-ass, each countries Jaeger has a distinct style tied to its culture and the inspiration drawn from pop culture robot/mech icons is done nicely without becoming straight up copies. The Kaiju are reminiscent of animals that live in our world that have been twisted by del Toro's famously unique and artistic mind into fearsome but beautiful creatures. Both the Jaegers and Kaiju are sure to become icons themselves and sell a but load of toys.<br/><br/>Though not as heavily as artistic as what has become expected of Guillermo del Toro's directing it is great nonetheless. He has adjusted from his movies which are generally on a smaller scale to capturing the epic size of this movie with almost perfection. The world he has filmed feels realistic and natural with the weather a constant complimentary feature though there are a few times in the battle scenes where the Jaegers and Kaiju feel obscured.<br/><br/>The CGI and VFX created by Industrial Light and Magic and Legacy Effects to bring not only the Jaegers and Kaiju, but the world it self to life is some of the best work I have seen in a movie since Avatar. It really transported me to another place and will be a front runner come Oscar season. It is also worth noting that the 3D is of particularly high quality, I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX 3D is possible.<br/><br/>The score composed by Ramin Djawadi really captures the emotion of the scenes from the sombre lows to the exhilarating highs. Tom Morello brings his rock groove to a few tracks the give them a really heavy feel and gets you pumped and Priscilla Ahn gives a particularly haunting performance on the track Mako.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is a movie that relies heavily on peoples nostalgia for the movies and TV shows of their childhood like Voltron, Transformers, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ultraman, Power Rangers and so on. These will be the people most excited to see it but I believe that this film really has universal appeal. I myself fit into the above nostalgic category, my girlfriend who doesn't still enjoyed it because of the human aspect of the story and kids who might not pick up on the subtleties of the story will enjoy it because to them it is awesome action with giant Mechs and Monsters, it is a film for all ages.<br/><br/>I went into this film hyped up, expecting it to be a lot of fun and despite a few missteps the whole experience was awesome and I had a great time. 9/10.<br/><br/>P.S - Stay a minute or two into the end credits..."

","10/10. I have been waiting for a movie like this for a long time. Growing up and going to the movies to watch Godzilla movies. I loved them but I always wished they could be done better. Cloverfield was awesome but I wanted more. Transformers are also a favorite but no monsters there. Pacific Rim really delivers. I have to say this is the best monster move of all time. Also the Robots (Jaegers) are incredible. Not a dull moment in this movie. I am going back tomorrow to see it in the IMAX theater. I want to see it in 3D now. The music score fit and sounded great. Pacific Rim starts fast and end with a fury. It keeps you locked in till the credits roll but don't forget to stay for the snippet after the first round of credits. Very funny. This is one of the best movies I have seen this summer. Right up there with the new Star Trek and maybe a little better than Iron Man 3. The movie does not disappoint. Go see it if you really want to be entertained for 2 Plus hours. You will not be sorry. After watching it at IMAX..... AWESOME! My new favorite movie. I may have to go see it for a third time. I was reading some of the negative reviews and I do not understand where these people's perspectives come from. Haters is all I see. This is one of Best summer movies in a long time. I can't stop thinking about how GREAT the movie was. I can't wait for the Blu Ray!"

","Today finding an original and good movie can be a hard thing to do but the new movie Pacific Rim is just that. Pacific Rim delivers a fast paced exciting action packed film with an intriguing story line and outstanding special effects.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim goes above and beyond you typical Kaiju (Monster) film. The film pulls together an original concept and forms a story around it that pulls the viewer into the world of the kaiju and Jaeger.<br/><br/>In the film, the story revolves around the concept of giant aliens invading earth in hopes to destroy mankind, so in humanities last ditch attempt to save itself they create giant robots called Jaegers to defend human kind. The amount of time and effort that was put into the special effects is incredible and payed of amazingly you can honestly believe you are watching a death-match with a giant robot and alien.<br/><br/>The story for the film also happens to be one of the most original i have seen in quite a while. today most movies are either a reboot of a previously done idea or a book. however pacific rim breaks this streak with a new original concept that makes for an amazing film.<br/><br/>A good original monster is such a rarity to find these days, however Pacific Rim delivers not just an amazing film but an all new experience for the viewer filled with outstanding acting, direction, story and some of the best special effects of our time"

","Pacific Rim is essentially a comedy, leisurely shot, and the _risibly small scale of the whole operation is striking (the entire scientific knowledge belongs to a couple of crazy scientists, and one of them utters as breaking news conclusions he should of arrived at from the beginning—the fact that the monsters are clones, as if the DNA analysis was the last thing one would do, and that, casually); the main impression being that of a good—natured humor. A very good comeback for Toro. It's lively, colorful and enthralling, brisk and charming—delightful, leisurely and over—the—top—by atmosphere and leisure, Toro gains a satisfying naturalness, in this surreal fairy tale. The trope of the alien _spoliators appears in no less than three important releases of this year—the Cruise vehicle 'Oblivion', the Superman reboot, and Toro's 'Pacific'. In all these, the aliens drain the Earth of its resources. In the last of the three movies, the Kaijus's breath is phosphorescent, as of neon.<br/><br/>This director, one of the names of his generation, behaves as if he knew how to shoot children's phantasms and visions, his trademark (at least some of his other movies are about kids' worlds), which is far from being the case.<br/><br/>And little Mori's terror actually borders on exploitation.<br/><br/>But there are many other things to enjoy, in this likable and satisfying outing—the very template it uses is a diversity of elements, there are many things in it.<br/><br/>The movies is occasionally funny, often merry, and _parodic (Pentecost's uplifting speech, wryly commented; the two crazy scientists, in a sort of steam—punk, as if in 2025 the Earth's whole knowledge about the Kaijus rested in the scatterbrains of two weird guys). But these are all elements, mere items—the style is very good, and it has ease.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is very well paced—swift, fast, but leisurely, i.e., never hurried—and Toro's playfulness has charm, and doesn't tear the story; actually, the movie achieves atmosphere, and I liked the work scenes, the dirt in the rooms, etc..<br/><br/>The movie's quasi—villain, Hannibal, was a treat—Perlman enjoyably over—the—top. But, of course, everything is over—the—top, and Gottlieb and Newt are affectionately portrayed in this humorous template.<br/><br/>The only real limitation is the cast—not very good, though there's of course some intended goofiness in the performances—Idris Elba often seems to keep himself from bursting into laughter, during his assuredly macho sent—offs. But I didn't like very much Hunnam—and the fact that Kazinsky looked like his clone didn't help, either.<br/><br/>This director had taken a long break from directing; it's good to welcome him back. I have seen two of his other movies, I perceived them as not entirely satisfying, this is one is the best so far."
"grindleguts","4","3","8","11 August 2013"," Teenage boys will love it; you will lament the shortcomings
","Uuuuhh... So I had a few hours to waste with a friend while we were at a music festival, and walked into town to watch whatever was offered. 'Pacific Rim' became our choice. I like many movies by Guillermo del Toro, so it had at least some premise. Expectations were not met.<br/><br/>The movie is a visual roller-coaster-ride, especially in 3D as we watched it. But that is all this movie has going for it. The plot is a poorly hidden copy of 'Independence Day' but with more flaws and inconsistency; the monsters are pretty much Godzilla meets The Host and the protagonists' robots are little but oversized Transformers. Nothing new under the sun. Some scenes are pretty much taken straight out of ID4, including the grand finale, but for some reason it still falls short of the previous movie even though we have 17 years of CGI and special effects development time. This goes to show that relying on effects at the cost of acting and plot does not make a good movie.<br/><br/>The actors are pretty bland. Guillermo del Toro frequently casts Ron Perlman, and this movie is no exception, and his character is not surprisingly the most entertaining even though he receives few minutes of screen time. Stereotypes prevail, another nuisance to someone past their teens. You have the Russian no-nonsense team, the angry scots/brits, the Asian martial arts team and finally the all-American team (yes, admittedly the Asian girl replaces the black guy eventually, but the setting was there).<br/><br/>Plot holes, stupid decisions, unrealistic characters and scientific inacurracies also serve to derail this sci-fi wreck of a train: Why choose such a vulnerable control system? How can the creatures all be clones with so different appearances, sizes, abilties? How can a makeshift lab be enough to facilitate synchronization between human and alien mind? What did the monsters use to track down a single scientist in the middle of a crowd of thousands? And why was that scientist in particular targeted - if they ""read his mind"" as I assume they did, they would not waste time on terminating that harmless individual. Why are the characters so emotionally driven in moments which require utmost rationality and to be able to overlook personal vendettas? Why does the world government (UN?) stop funding a working defensive program (not to mention: how can money be an issue in the face of annihilation)?<br/><br/>So many questions, so few answers. A 4/10 for the visual thrill of the year, but if 3D and huge monsters does not work on you they will not save the experience for you either."
"gammagt","4","3","8","1 August 2013"," Great effects and setting, but oh so shallow
","Well, I'm a nerd, I love mechs and was thrilled at the prospect to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it is a spectacle.<br/><br/>But still, the more the story progresses, the more holes you see in it. The weaponry makes no sense. I will not criticize, that maybe some small high yield mobile weapons would probably have been ten times more efficient against those foes humankind faces in that movie. As I said, I love mechs ;) <br/><br/>But the weapons the bots utilize? Please! One time it takes like 20 secs to charge a plasma gun, later in the movie it takes more like three, and in one scene, they don't need to charge it at all, blasting an alien corpse with abandon... Activating a e.g. ballistic weapon(in a fighting/killing machine) takes seconds and a voice command where everything else works through neural links, instead? Then, after ""fistfighting"" the aliens for one hour of felt movie brawl time(the weapons take so long sometimes, that they seem utterly useless at times - But well...), one of the pilots wants revenge for her family and ""discovers"", that the protagonist's mech has a chainsword, that just slices through the enemy like paper? Seriously?! How stupid is that? <br/><br/>Then one of the good guy's scientists creates a neural link to a part of one of the Kaiju's brains, which leads to the discovery of the enemy's plans for earth. So far so good - But(!) the link goes both ways and the Kaiju learn of the scientist who linked to the brain, and one of the monsters even adapt through knowledge gained from the scientist. He then does it another time, sharing the link with another scientist. They learn something, but the fact that the link goes both ways(and those two know more or less everything important about the defense) is just discarded. No consequences. Well, and the ending is shallow, ending with stupid jests, stupid sacrifices, and the heroes saving the day of course(at least I have nothing against that, eh?).<br/><br/>As I said - It's a great GCI spectacle, but kindly turn you brain of while watching, or you might not enjoy watching that one."

","This is a bit of Transformers meets Alien meets Real Steel meets Godzilla meets Avatar. Aliens (who resemble the ones from Alien and Howard the Duck) emerge from beneath the ocean surface to attack coastal cities, and humans develop giant robots manned by two pilots to bring them down. After a defeat early on by our hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, this robot program faces elimination. And a rogue captain tracks down Hunnam (who's taken a civilian job) and attempts to save Hong Kong using the last of the robots. Hunnam wishes to team with a young Japanese woman, whom the captain cares for, but she has difficulty overcoming the emotions left over from the killing of her family during an alien attack.<br/><br/>I saw this from the front row, and the 3D was excellent. I really felt as though I were going to get wet or hit with debris. The visual effects and look of the movie were excellent. Some of the charterization and script are problematic. The two scientists at the base are pencil necked, squeaky voiced comic relief characters and it's hard to tell if they're giving bad performances or the script just demanded that they act like cartoons. The soldiers, especially Hunnam, try so hard to be macho it's almost funny. He's concentrating so hard on looking butch, he forgets to act and his accent fades in and out. Nonetheless, I think if he becomes less self conscious about his acting, he could be a big star. He has a bit of a Brad Pitt look about him. The Japanese woman is a bit of a weak character. The audience is supposed to giggle as she coos around Charlie, and I suppose some people might think it's sexist that the only major woman in the movie is portrayed most of the time as being too emotional to be a pilot. Obviously, most people aren't going to a movie like this for the script and compelling characters. I compared it to Transformers above, but only because of the robots. One great thing is that I can always tell who's who, where the action is happening, and what the stakes are. In Transformers, action scenes go on for forty minutes and we aren't clear who's attacking who. There are some clichés during attack scenes, with bits of obvious humor thrown in. But generally I think this movie will win over most people. Definitely don't wait to see it on video. See it 3D in the theater if this title interests you at all."

"SforSmile","6","3","9","10 August 2013"," Great CGI-Fun.
","While lacking of a truly captivating story, Pacific Rim is a grandiose and impressive battle flick about giant robots fighting giant sea monsters in the style of Japanese Anime series that thankfully gets along (almost) without any pathos and exaggerated patriotism as it is often the case in Hollywood disaster movies of this sort (i.e. ""Independence Day"" or ""Armageddon""); since it never takes itself too seriously and yet refrains from being ridiculous or silly.<br/><br/>This movie is especially made for the theaters, an experience of epic proportions that certainly must blow up the frame of your common flat screen TV at home. Therefore I highly recommend to see it at the cinema in 3D as long as it's still possible. The robots (Jaeger) are so big and heavy that, while walking, I had the impression that the floor, beneath my feet, was trembling with every step they made which of course came from the powerful stereo sound. The monsters (Kaiju) are simply huge and terrifying, you cannot tell where their bodies actually start like endless mountains of flesh. These two gigantic forces colliding with each other subsequently leads to (slightly overlong) battle scenes that are to be described as state-of the-art in terms of CGI effects and destructive frenzy being dirty, brute and swept with rain and pacific water; in its magnitude only surpassed by ""Transformers"" and ""The Avengers"" - a real ""Materialschlacht"" as we would say in Germany.<br/><br/>With such a premise it's not surprising that the actual actors are more or less pushed into the background. Idris Elba has great charisma in front of the camera, but his role as the commanding officer is noticeably not very challenging due to a lack of diversity in character development which is maybe why he appears a bit stiff in his uniform. The same goes for the other actors who all appear somewhat pale with Charlie Day as a refreshing exception in his role as Dr. Newt adding much to the humor of the movie. <br/><br/>The script itself seemingly paying homage to the Asian monster movies nevertheless missing their susceptibility to intransigence and craziness instead orientates itself too much on the usual Hollywood Blockbuster ingredients for success leaving you with the aftertaste that you have seen it all before one way or another (i.e. ""Cloverfield"", ""Godzilla"") thus being rather predictable. <br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro surely did better movies, however, with ""Pacific Rim"" he proved that he is able to maintain a certain standard which perfectly met my expectations albeit not surpassing them so that I cannot but give it a good 6 points out of ten."

Unlike movies like ""Fast and Furious 6"", ""Pacific Rim"" gives nothing to talk about, no big action sequence or anything we haven't seen before. The movie is just scenes from other movies put together starting with the definition of Kaijus, kind of like the opening to ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>Kaijus: Colossal alien beasts who rise from an interdimensional portal on the Pacific floor to devastate human cities.<br/><br/>Thats all you need to know, there's not much to it apart from that, the movie is what you would expect. Transformers + Godzilla = Power Rangers... or in this case, Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>I liked the cast, too bad they've wasted their efforts on making such a poor action film. Well, its actually not bad, but there's not much to it, it gave me the same feeling I got when watching Power Rangers as a little kid. I would watch it, then go run and play and forget I even saw it.<br/><br/>Its also safe to say its definitely the loudest movie of the year, its just an average action movie that feels like a failed cash grab by Guillermo del Toro. It does have a few good moments though, like one unexpected death scene I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, but apart from that its just a wannabe Michael Bay movie.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to anyone who liked ""Top Gun"", ""Independence Day"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Transformers"", or ""Armageddon""."
"homdeb1058","9","3","9","18 July 2013"," It Was As Good As They Say It Is
","Outstanding movie. Only thing wrong was the small crowd in the theater made people a little shy to stand up and cheer for the good guys. It was a stand up and cheer movie. Good old basic us vs them plot. Excellent monster aliens. Funtastic monster robots. Impressive CGI fight scenes (in which they avoided using the usual trick of speeding up the action so they can get by with less fine detail). Likable characters which we want to win. The women can kick butt just like the guys. Avoided cluttering up the central action with a clumsy love story.<br/><br/>Upgrading those old Gozilla stop action monsters was way long overdue. Thank you guys for not screwing it up. This was an excellent movie. Go see it."
"tangojazz","9","3","9","18 July 2013"," Giant MMA Robot vs. Monster Smackdown. Fantastic. But...
","Yes, this movie has certainly raised the bar on ""Monster Movies"". A definite leap forward from the ""the guy in the rubber suit"" days. I give this movie 9 out of 10 for the imagination and special effects that dazzled throughout. The fights were the thing, though. Incredible. Especially the one where the American guy and the Japanese girl take on the flying whatchamacallit in outer space. But,I take away one star. Why? It is because the magic and wonder of the early cheesy ""Monster flicks"" (the Japanese ones, the Korean one, Harry Hausen's creations) was not there. I, for one, think it wouldn't have been so bad if this was a joint American-Japanese production (Del Toro also being there to see that things didn't become cheesy). The old magic and wonder is missing. I was somewhat disappointed to see that the monsters could be killed by conventional arms (although you would need a lot of them) and that ""nukes"" could definitely take them out. How would these monsters fare against ""Mothra"", ""Rodan"" and especially ""Godzilla""?But, see the movie, it's fun."
"bcatdclub","9","3","9","18 July 2013"," 2013 summer must see!
","I heard about this film right here on IMDb and the rating was quite high. The last movie I went to see was Man of Steal at the I-Max in 3d and when the military had Superman I fell asleep. Being a hot summer day in Texas I went to a theater more for a brief dark cool getaway from the heat. I had an idea that Pacific Rim might be good but really new it was possible I would crash on the reclining comfy AMC chairs.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. The movie seems like it would follow the usual doomed mankind movie. You know where some diabolical entity more powerful than humans is about to exterminate mankind and then at the moment hope is all but gone a hero pulls together and the sun rises to the cheer of humans once again. Maybe it does maybe it does not. You will have to see it. But this film looks great, features awesome action, good character development and has an old school analog feel to a modern digital film.<br/><br/>You really should not pass this one up at the theater. This movie is offered in 3d as well as a standard viewing. I saw the regular version."
"virindra","9","3","9","18 July 2013"," Best action movie of the year?
","I was looking forward to see this movie, for a long time. This should be Real Steel in the square. The movie is about big robots, driven by people to destroy huge monsters. Very simple story with many layers. Acting was good, action and special effects were awesome. Soundtrack rocked. This movie is a treat. During the movie I was wondering if the cast was chosen well, but it worked out well eventually. Ron Perlman was great, as usual. Charly Day was annoying with his weird voice, as usual. <br/><br/>It could be the best action movie of the year, but the year ain't over yet. If there will be an action movie, that will be better than Pacific Rim, I will be amazed. I'm sure waiting for the sequel.<br/><br/>See this in the cinema, Imax."
"raymondcowie455","9","3","9","18 July 2013"," Sensational film maling
","Take Independence day, add Transformers (the first, good one) and blend together through the striking style of Guillermo Del Toro, and you have a triumph. This kept me enthralled from opening to sneaky post credits bonus. As someone who has become very disillusioned with CGI driven, plot and character empty titles such as all the Iron man films, this is in a totally different league. Proves that massive monsters and destruction on a global scale can be awesome when done by a film maker of Del Toros skill and vision. Fun, nail biting, dazzling, great characters and performances. There's not much else needs to be said, just see it. I can't comment on the 3D, I gave up on it some time ago, but in 2D it rocks!"
"specialuse117","9","3","9","18 July 2013"," fun film with no Hollywood message, 3d worked well
","I caught this spectacular film in IMAX3D so my experience reflects that unique environment.<br/><br/>This movie was entertaining on many levels. Technically it took my breath away with the sense of scope and the set design, every set was a masterpiece. When add the effect of well down 3D it was the most immersive time I have ever spent at a movie.<br/><br/>Pacing was lean and precise - no wasted overdrawn character development, no unnecessary characters like a news reporter who becomes a hero or a hooker with a heart of gold . When an explanation was needed it was simple and understandable. My 12 year old twins were with me and could easily follow the plot. Having the differing 2 scientists was an easy way to explain the ""science"" part of the film.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot was predictable but this did not detract from the film. This was a film to entertain, not to force a message of global warming or evil businessmen like every other Hollywood film.<br/><br/>I always give an extra point to the score if the trailer of the film actually matches the true content of the film. In this case it does."
"Jakoushirou","8","3","9","18 July 2013"," I got exactly what I wanted from this film. Epic battles between giant robots and even bigger monsters.
","I was very exciting when I saw trailer. Then director name, wow it will be good! Later there is information about the conversion to 3D - OK, 3D is not worth it! But, there is no IMAX without 3D, so I had to agree for IMAX 3D. I hoped that 3D will be not worse than in Iron Man 3D (and hopefully it wasn't).<br/><br/>Pacific Rim finally came to cinemas, I took 3 friends, bought tickets for IMAX 3d and some beers for better visual effect of 3D and I was ready for watching! In spite of many unfavorable reviews, which have appeared after the first screenings I didn't change my attitude, I was still expecting something great.<br/><br/>First scenes surprised me, I though that movie will be about it how first kaijou (monsters in Pacific Rim) appears and what whole human civilization did for stop them from destroying humanity - creating jaegers. It not happens, a brief introduction in first year of conflict between united humanity and kaijous and action of movie was placed in ~20 year of conflict, in time when it escalated.<br/><br/>And I got exactly what I wanted from this film. Epic battles between giant robots and even bigger monsters. Destroyed cities during this battles. I got what I expected.<br/><br/>Pity that the producers have choose the easy way and most of the action happens at night or in the water, what makes picture a little bit too dark, what for 3D image is not good. But they have to to close in 200 millions so that can be understandable.<br/><br/>PS. No one left cinema room before end of movie like many peoples have written in their critic reviews. everyone was quite pleased with the film, so if you are excited at the thought of fighting giant robots with giant monsters, go buy your own tickets!"
"lambiepie-2","8","3","9","18 July 2013"," Sparking memories of childhood...
","Pacific Rim is meant to pay homage to those who grew up around the time of ""the other"" ToHo films and ToHo type films entering the market like what Del Toro saw while growing up. It's been decades since these movies got the big screen treatment, and this is a nice re-entry piece decades later that I hope gives the green-light to others as well.<br/><br/>What's the story? Well, the story is simpler than most, but this is not a film presented to complicate your mind. It's easy to get, the characters are easy to understand. You'll get the feeling that the filmmakers are give homage to those 'kaiju' films before it, the plot, humorous scientists, those who want to make a buck off of tragedy and monsters. The 'kaiju' were all that one expects them to be: huge, menacing, loud and armed with a few surprises. And so are the man piloted robots.<br/><br/>The robots aren't Power Rangers or even Transformers. These Robots, called Jaegers in this film, do not transform into anything. They cannot hide or blend into the scenery. The Jaegers in this film don't throw karate kicks. The Jaegers do not give any moral messages or speeches. They too are big and loud, piloted by humans and are just battle equipment. They are ""fighting machines"" against the kaiju coming up from the pacific rim.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare films were it doesn't posses your typical movie tack-ons to lure one in (i.e., a star name, a love story, teens, etc.), and that may be one of the film's major downfalls. Audiences may be so used to this so that when its missing, they may think the film is a failure. Not necessarily. It's monsters vs. robots. The only thing I would have liked to have seen are more of the international robots & pilots and their stories, as some were mentioned but had too little screen time for my tastes. <br/><br/>Pacific Rim is what the old 'popcorn' movie is all about. It's monsters-from-the-deep matinée genre. It is fun, nice action fight scenes with nods to the models and scales of those old 60s films, and man within robots to save the Earth from getting taken over."
"george.schmidt","8","3","9","17 July 2013"," Guillermo del Toro's epic valentine to giant monsters run amok horror films
","PACIFIC RIM (2013) *** Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Max Martini, Robert Kazinsky, Clifton Collins, Jr., Ron Perlman, Diego Klattenhoff. Guillermo del Toro's epic valentine to giant monsters run amok horror films is a hybrid of sci-fi including ""Godzilla"", ""Inception"" and take your pick of any Ray Harryhausen fantasy with a touch of HP Lovecraft: set in the future Earth finds itself under siege from ginormous alien monsters from an underwater chasm unleashing hellspawns forcing humanity to combat with equally humongous tech savvy robots in a fight to the finish. While its tin-eared dialogue is on par with James Cameron (del Toro collaborating with Travis Beacham), the visual f/x are pretty awesome with its splendidly over-the-top gargantuan bitch slapping over worldwide metropolises and severely major property damage. The behemoth beasties are truly amazing in their looks suggesting Disney's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" from ""FANTASIA"" meets the Mos Eisley cantina denizens of ""Star Wars""."
"an_drutz","6","3","9","17 July 2013"," Kept me entertained, but felt like sex without an orgasm. Left me cranky. Tnx a lot.
","ON THE PLUS SIDE: <br/><br/>1. great visuals and I must say that I absolutely LOVED the giant robots! All the details, all the enthusiasm that has been put into making them really does transpire into the screen;<br/><br/>2. very good acting for some of the cast members: Chalie Hunnam, who I felt gave a very honest and solid performance, proving to be a great lead character ;Idris Elba, with his unique scene presence and charisma; Ron Perlman, as always, added flavor to the whole experience-I would give them a 9 or 10 for their performances alone, if i could rank that separately <br/><br/>3. good entertainment, quite fun to watch overall<br/><br/>4. interesting concepts of ""neural hand-shake"" and compatibility; also interesting idea about the Kaiju being sea-creatures as opposed to coming from the skies; <br/><br/>ON THE MINUS SIDE:<br/><br/>1. weak story, LOUSY SCRIPT, really seemed like the focus of the movie was the design of the monsters and the robots, and the cool CGI effects, and the rest(what one would call ""the actual script"") was just there as a mandatory introduction to the action scenes<br/><br/>2. very ONE DIMENSIONAL characters! (Charlie Hunnam's character was just some dude who lost his brother; Rinko Kikuchi's Mako Mori was just some girl who had been traumatized by the kaijus; etc etc etc)<br/><br/>3. NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, no real connections<br/><br/>4. very bad acting from some of the cast members, and I am specifically disappointed in RINKO KIKUCHI'S ACTING, she was all over the place. In one scene she acts like this stupid little girl who HIDES in shame!! like a silly teenager for being caught glancing at Hunnam's character while he was changing his t-shirt!?! WTF?? Isn't this a girl who was supposed to have been raised amongst men and soldiers, isn't she supposed to be a tough girl, a pilot, a warrior? Well, in the next scene she actually IS Xena, the warrior princess, as she beats the s**T out of Hunnam while mocking him, in training. And then she acts again like a frightened, stupid, disabled, mentally challenged little girl in ALL the other scenes, I mean COME ON, make up your mind! Who are you gonna be? A little consistency, please! It's just not believable, that's all...And it's not about ""being complex"" or having ""nuanced personality traits"", it's just about not knowing how to play the character(in my opinion, at least).<br/><br/>I also thought the scientists were over played, seemed stupidly unfunny to me at times.<br/><br/>5. this movie is a collection of clichés, from start to finish, there is almost nothing original in the story, nothing that you haven't seen 100 times before plot wise(except what i mentioned in the plus side section of the review).<br/><br/>6.and maybe the most ANNOYING thing for me was the fact that there was NO SENSE OF FINALITY to a world supposedly in the BRINK OF EXTINTION. It lacks a certain air of DOOM, DISPAIR AND HUMAN SUFFERING. Also, I didn't felt any human connections or some great sense of camaraderie. Everyone was ""meah, we lost a crew but we don't have the time to feel sorry for them...maybe later"". I mean c'mon!!<br/><br/>7.The whole love story seemed highly unlikely and very, very, VERY! badly written, also no chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi. When did the ""feelings"" between those 2 developed anyway? Did they show that while I was dozing?? Was it ""love at first..neural connection""? <br/><br/>8. Speakig of the neural hand-shake..Why, in the world, would you need to shout orders and indications at someone WHILE YOU ARE IN THEIR BRAIN?? I could understand it if speaking, shouting, screaming came instinctively, like a reflex, like screaming when you get bitten by something, but giving fairly calm indications, making suggestions WHILE YOU INHABIT the other person's BRAIN?!? I'm just sayin'...<br/><br/>And I could go on, and on, and on...<br/><br/>I gave it a 6 for the CGI and most of the acting, and for being entertained. Buttttt, like I said in the summary, left me...not satisfied. And thus, a little cranky."
"tictack","7","3","9","17 July 2013"," RIP Godzilla, RIP Transformers!!
","Epic proportions, humongous creatures and larger than life CGI not new to Hollywood movies but Pacific Rim takes it to a notch above. I wanted to watch the movie for Del Toro whose Pan's Labyrinth was the one I watched recently which was brilliant. of course, this movie is at different scale altogether but still Del Toro manages to pull it of nicely considering how these mega movies can go easily wrong and lost in plot. The prologue is short and crisp which gives background and also more then the glimpse of these monster Kaijus and Jaegars. But you may think it plays spoiler if you expected dramatic entry of these creatures but it does not happen. Its definitely not the first of its kind movie, we have seen them before I wont say this is better scripted but yes, better visualized for sure as technology continues to make progress. As of performances, probably not too much was expected as it was not the focus but Edris Alba keeps it all together and kind of drives the entire movie. The two scientist characters though seem cheesy. The real heroes are the Kaijus and Jaegars which hog the limelight and the fights between them are well crafted and CGI is brilliant to go with the rather nice plot. At the end, as it happens in most of the sci-fi stuff, America saves the world and prove themselves as the guardians of the humanity!! Contradictory to the real world one would assume, anyways a nice watch for Mega sci-fi fans and choosy watchers too. Hard to be disappointed after watching this"
"whoa17","8","3","9","16 July 2013"," One big does of nostalgia
","Story: It was pretty simple and it was straight-forward, sure there are some subplots that were thrown in but these were used to give the story a much deeper thought. However, even though the usage of subplots was critical to deepen the narrative of this movie, it did not make the movie of the story any better. I'm not saying that the story is bad, what I'm saying is that it could have been better.<br/><br/>Despite having a low-brow story, it does have it's advantage and that is it was easy to follow and it does not take itself too complicated or too convoluted, it just went on with it's goal and this movie accomplished that which was showing giant mechs vs. giant robots.<br/><br/>In addition, I like the tone that they went for in this movie, it was serious but it still managed to give out some few laughs especially the scenes with Charlie Day.<br/><br/>Acting: The performance of the cast was pretty great especially Idris Elba. Whenever this guys just pops on the screen, he delivers and he also managed to ""out-act"" his costars because he is the type of character who you should follow, a character who you should root for and a character who you do not want to touch. Too bad he wasn't the lead male character.<br/><br/>My statement from above is not a way to say that Charlie Hunnam (the film's male lead) didn't do a good job in the role. In my opinion, he did a great job with it the only problem with him is that he lacked the charisma to be a good leading actor, there was something missing in his performance that most of leading characters have.<br/><br/>As for the others, they did a good job on their roles, Rinko Kikuichi was a delight and to actually hear her speak English is a sigh of relief. Charlie Day was funny and also did a good job on his role the guy from The Dark Knight Rises (Burn Gorman) also did a good job and his chemistry with Day was almost pure comedic gold. But there was one actor who really ignite the movie when he appeared, and that is Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau, a Kaiju organ dealer in the black market. He was incredible in this role despite a short screen time. To sum up his performance, he was a threatening wise-ass.<br/><br/>Action: This aspect just delivers on so many levels, it was epic and delivered a good dosage of nostalgia. The movement of both the mechs and Kaijus were incredible and when they started fighting it was just jaw-dropping and a truly magnificent thing to see on screen.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is the main reason we go to watch movies, and that is to have fun and be entertained with what the hell is happening on screen. This is how you make an action sequence for robot, slow yet powerful and bot quick and forgettable (yes I'm looking at you Transformers).<br/><br/>Music: I really didn't mind the score in this movie but I will say that it comes off as triumphant and it gives hope to vanquish the Kaiju that is present.<br/><br/>What really caught my attention though is the sound-mixing. My God, it was incredible, hats off to those involved with the mixing, it was really good and it really took you in to the experience.<br/><br/>Cinematography/VFX: If there is one thing that I love in the shows like 'Ultraman' and 'Power rangers', it is the grand battle between the giant robots and the giant version of the villains. Those scenes were able to show a big scope even with the use of miniatures. With this movie, I was able to experience that again, each action scene shown had great shots which showed how big the scope of the movie is. It made me relieve the old days again. <br/><br/>The VFX was also top-notch in this movie. You know that this are just CGI but at time and it came off as really believable. You can almost feel like it is happening in front of you. the design of the Jaegers and the Kaijus were also amazing, it makes you to want to buy an official art book of the movie. <br/><br/>Direction: Del Toro's last film was Hellboy II: The Golden Army and it was one of the best comic book films ever in my opinion. It showed how complex he can be working behind the camera, and in this movie he also did the same. My issues with his direction is the pacing that he used for the film, the first act was fast and makes you delve in the movie but by the second act it gets a little boring although these scenes were pivotal to the movie and in the last act it picks up the pace again and manages to be one great movie. My second issue was that he wasn't able to let his cast live up to their full extent (except for Elba and Day) there was something missing to the performance of his cast. <br/><br/>Overall: Even though the film suffers from story depth, charisma from the lead actor and that the film is clearly a style over substance type of movie, it still managed to entertain me and gives one hell of a ride to my inner child and that was one awesome experience that is truly unforgettable.<br/><br/>Favorite monologue/line: Stacker Pentecost: Today at the edge of our hope, at the end of our time. We have chosen to believe in each other. Today we face the monsters that are at our door, today we are cancelling the apocalypse!<br/><br/>Be sure to check out my blog for more reviews: http://ztrospective.blogspot.com/"

","I went into the cinema to watch this with not much expectations - i figured that it was simply another ""epic"" sci fi movie with big robots and b grade actors...<br/><br/>However, while the list of actors wasn't the worlds most famous, they held up pretty well and delivered the story quite well - albeit a few corny lines, which i thought probably needed to be in there to cater to a wide variety of audiences! So tick off the list!<br/><br/>Big robots? The trailer made me thing of the Japanese anime gundam had come to life, and in all honesty, it pretty much did! The graphics, which apparently were 2-3 years ahead of their time and where the majority of the budget obviously was spent, was incredible. The detail was magnificent and each mech was well designed and not over the top! Technology that existed in the movie was really amazing and fitting for the time the movie was based!<br/><br/>Sci-Fi Epic? Well the movie has several international locations, huge man made mechas with guns, armour and the like, invading alien species and amazing special effects? Its a pretty damn good movie!"

"zowen88","9","3","9","14 July 2013"," Great movie for the ""I don't like summer block busters"" crowd.
","If you are looking for that summer block buster movie that is more than just a summer block bust, look no further than Pacific Rim. Pacific Rim has very few recognizable actors, to my memory at least. Without all the cheesy A-List actors who would inevitably remind you of another role they played, ripping your mind away from what is going on in front of you, the action is immersing. The movie is deeper than just action though but not really in a make you think kind of way. It presents you with more story and more emotional defeat and victory in the intro than most movies of the ""epic fight""/""big machine fight"" genre give you in an entire film. It doesn't stop there. We are given a very interesting dynamic between several characters that doesn't need a lot of back story to sell their motivations. A lot is said with the words that they speak. <br/><br/>The movie isn't your run of the mill giant robots fighting HUGE MONSTERS. This movie really felt like a live action anime. Things you would have never thought were possible in live action are done throughout. The cg is impeccable. The scale of things is incredible. The monsters are ingenious. I found myself LOVING the monster design, and this was key. I feel like this movie accomplishes what other movies failed to do. Del Toro and his crew created Kaiju (monsters) that I wanted to see more of. They were awesome and terrible things that I couldn't get enough of. This goes for the Jaegers as well. They were all different in design and functionality, but not so much that it was distracting or confusing. Without giving too much away, there are not a lot of Jaegers around when you get to the meat of the story. <br/><br/>Give this movie a chance and you will find yourself cheering on the pilots, saying ""WHAT THE FUUUU..."" about the Kaiju, helping the Jaegers fight, and celebrating victories. On it's face, this movie is about giant robots fighting giant monsters, but beneath that is a beautiful story about ENORMOUS robots fighting ENORMOUS monsters. I give it a solid 8.5/10"
"Nokitron","7","3","9","13 July 2013"," I am totally waiting for the sequel!
","Many people made the long review, so I will just give you the summary of what I saw: <br/><br/>1. The opening battle(When you saw Raleigh with his brother fought Knifehead) seems so bold. I just awe and scream excited while watching it. The second battle scene I like is the last fight when Gypsy slash that motha***** into two pieces, ofc.<br/><br/>2. Newton and Hermann is funny overall. The quote I love from Hermann is: ""The numbers is the thing that close from this world truth."" or something like that.<br/><br/>3. The BGM! Yes. The BGM. I've never heard a great mood-building BGM as Pacific Rim does. It sounds so hopeful and strong.<br/><br/>But, I have some of the, if I could say, disappointment, from this movie: <br/><br/>1. No details info about the Kaiju. They only explained the codename, from the people's mouth. I really hope I saw the details like when I playing House of The Dead or watching Kids Next Door.<br/><br/>2. We need more Jaeger. <br/><br/>3. We need more Jaeger that stood still. Seriously? Only four Jaegers and all of them is crushed? I mean, look at Cherno Alpha. Never miss a beat for six years, and lose a fight for many minutes? <br/><br/>4. Yes, the acting is mediocre, but not that bad. I must admit it. Even the little Mako acted better than the main character.<br/><br/>All of them, I cannot wait for the sequel, whether it is bad or better. This movie is not summed up with only a nuclear blast, i know it. It could not.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Troy_Campbell","8","3","9","13 July 2013"," Cancelling the apocalypse has never looked so good.
","The publicity for Guillermo del Toro's robots vs monsters saga promised it would go big. That was an understatement - this blockbuster goes colossal. In fact I'm hard pressed to think of a movie that's larger in terms of physical scope, if not concept or narrative. It's easy to see where the reported US$180m budget and additional year in production was spent; del Toro has crafted a visually spectacular experience that goes from one breathtaking set piece to the next, rarely allowing you to exhale, let alone notice the numerous plot contrivances or gaps in its own logic. The CGI is, predictably, utterly flawless and the 3D (the main reason behind del Toro's demands for an extra year before release) is immersive, whilst the creation of both the massive man-made machines and the gigantic alien creatures are imaginative and memorable. As for the puny humans, 'Sons of Anarchy' star Charlie Hunnam - a future A- lister without doubt - is charismatic and strong in the lead role, Rinko Kikuchi is intriguing as the sidekick shrouded in mystery and Idris Elba is reliably compelling as the tough military leader who is attempting to cancel the apocalypse. Unfortunately, this film also emphasises why I can't stand comedian (I use the term loosely) Charlie Day; he's once again painfully irritating as a shrieking douche bag. There's no denying that del Toro has discarded a strong story in place of delivering unabashed popcorn thrills, but when it looks this damn good it's hard to care."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","3","9","13 July 2013"," The great kind of big, fun, dumb and exciting
","Movies don't get much more straightforward than giant robots battling giant monsters from another dimension. The giant monster movie is a classic genre, so in this age of all Hollywood blockbusters feeling pressured to earn their stripes by leveling a major world city, a return to these roots was inevitable. ""Pacific Rim"" delivers that old-school feel with the added pleasure of outstanding contemporary visual effects, and it results in a towering heap of giddy entertainment. <br/><br/>When you look at the entire film catalog of giant monster movies, more than a majority would be classified as B-movies. ""Pacific Rim"" doesn't count under ""so bad it's good,"" but director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro has no intention of allowing audiences to believe that the film takes itself too seriously, at least never for very long. As much as moviegoers' appreciation for mentally stimulating ""smart"" blockbusters has grown, that's not what this production went for by any stretch.<br/><br/>That essentially means ""Pacific Rim"" gives your brain permission to turn off and instead soak in the scale and wonder of giant robots fighting giant monsters. <br/><br/>In truth, the script is total garbage. Travis Beacham, who wrote the film (with help from del Toro), also credits 2010's ""Clash of the Titans"" to his name, so that tells you del Toro and his uncanny imagination play the biggest role in ""Pacific Rim's"" success. Namely it's the dialogue that's atrocious, but the characters are poorly developed, with each assigned a single past trauma that completely defines them. The salvation of it all(which understandably may not be salvation for all viewers), comes again from that all-important lack of self-seriousness. It will remind a lot of people of some of the first big special effects blockbusters of the '90s, in which wonder and excitement take the driver's seat and help you smile through all the dumb supporting characters and subplots.<br/><br/>The film begins seven years after the Kaiju first began to emerge from a portal deep within the Pacific ocean. Our hero, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) explains that to limit the planes and tanks it took to bring the beasts down, world leaders worked together to build Jaegers, giant robots piloted by two skilled soldiers connected by a neural bridge. The way all this works is somewhat fascinating, so Beacham deserves props for that much.<br/><br/>When a battle with a Kaiju off the Alaskan coast ends badly for Raleigh, five more years go by and the world is starting to lose the war against the Kaiju, who have begun to adapt and dispatch Jaegers with ease. When all hope appears to be lost, Raleigh's old boss, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), commander of the Jaeger operation, recruits Raleigh to pilot his old Jaeger in a last-ditch effort. Together, with the world's few remaining Jaegers and their pilots, a rookie pilot (Rinko Kikuchi) and two nutty researchers (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman), they are the last stand for humanity.<br/><br/>The design of both bots and creatures is outstanding, and you'd expect nothing less from del Toro. A much younger version of myself would be captivated enough to buy a Jaeger toy or two, for sure. And not only that, but del Toro captures the sheer size of these things in ways that Michael Bay never has with the ""Transformers"" films. That sense of scale proves pivotal to being drawn into this film. Without that huge epic scope and some imaginative visual effects, all ""Pacific Rim"" has going for it is a neat concept.<br/><br/>And oh, the action sequences. The film's penultimate battle would be grand finale material in 90 percent of other blockbusters. The fact that it comes earlier, however, makes the final sequence much more surprising. The plot appears to lay all the cards out on the table in this second-to-last sequence, making the ending a total mystery.<br/><br/>How del Toro can take something as big and clunky as this film and turn it into a total thrill is mystifying. He should teach a class on how to make big movies that look and feel dumb but somehow slap a stupid smile on your face and all Hollywood studios should force their blockbuster filmmakers to enroll before they set out to make the next big and dumb but also un-watchable movie.<br/><br/>Not every other component besides the visual one stinks. Kikuchi's Mako is a slightly more complicated character, Day's role and Ron Perlman's cameo are stupid funny but funny and the acting is solid enough across the board to make us believe that these characters do indeed care about each other, which in turn helps us care about them more than we might otherwise be inclined.<br/><br/>For all those that complain about critics being cold and unable to appreciate a fun, mindless blockbuster, check out the Rotten Tomatoes score on this one. There are ways to make a good mindless blockbuster and there are ways to make a bad one. ""Pacific Rim"" is a nearly textbook example of the former. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"asu-ray20","9","3","9","13 July 2013"," best gigantic war movies ...ever made...
","viewing a gigantic war movie in 3-d was really an awesome experience.the director Guillermo del Toro and the total special effect team made the monster's look vivid.their was humor through out the movie and the gigantic action scene will really blow you away,and above all the plot was also good.<br/><br/>PLOT - The Jaeger program is initially successful in fending off Kaiju attacks and at first turns the tide of the war. However, over time, Kaiju cross through the portal at a faster rate, with each new Kaiju becoming increasingly well-adapted for fighting against the Jaegers. As such, the robots become less and less effective, causing the now-united governments of Earth to lose faith in the Jaegers' ability to defend humanity. The Jaeger program is terminated, with resources diverted to building the ""Wall of Hope"", a coastal fortification to protect Earth's cities. The four of the remaining Jaegers are redeployed to Hong Kong to defend the unfortified coastline until the wall can be completed. Stacker Pentecost, the commander of the Jaeger forces, devises a plan to end the war once and for all with an illegally-acquired Russian nuclear warhead.<br/><br/>Pentecost approaches former pilot Raleigh Becket and convinces him to return to the program. Becket and his brother Yancy had once been pilots of Gypsy Danger and tasked with defending the Alaskan coastline. During a mission, they ignored an order and engaged a kaiju directly. Yancy was torn from the cockpit while still connected to his brother, and the experience traumatized Raleigh. Upon returning to the program, Raleigh goes through a rigorous process of testing to find a new co-pilot, since the stronger the connection between two pilots, the better their performance in battle. Raleigh demands to be partnered with Mako Mori, a test pilot whose participation Pentecost opposes, as Mako is his adoptive daughter. He eventually relents and allows her to partner Raleigh. The couple's initial test run nearly ends in disaster when Mako gets caught up in a memory of an encounter with a kaiju as a child and inadvertently activates and nearly discharges Gypsy Danger's primary weapons system while still in the hanger. The two are withdrawn from the field indefinitely as the remaining Jaegers are tasked with fending off a dual kaiju attack. The defense of Hong Kong goes poorly, with the kaiju quickly destroying two Jaegers and disabling a third. Pentecost has no choice but to authorize Raleigh and Mako to mount a last stand, and the two drive off the assault.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dr. Newton Geizler—a scientist studying the kaiju—assembles a machine that allows him to establish a mental link with a fragment of a kaiju brain in the same way that Jaeger pilots connect with one another. The experience nearly kills him, but he discovers that the kaiju are actually genetically-bred weapons sent to Earth as an invading force to allow their masters to colonize the planet. With Pentecost's approval, he seeks out Hannibal Chau, a major figure in the trade of illegal kaiju parts, in an attempt to get a new kaiju brain to repeat the experiment. Chau criticises Geizler's foolishness in merging with the kaiju brain, as he has now attracted their attention, and the kaiju attacking Hong Kong are specifically seeking him out. After Gypsy Danger kills the kaiju attacking the city, Chau and his crew of poachers move in to harvest parts. Geizler realises, too late, that the kaiju is pregnant, and Chau and his crew are attacked by the newborn baby kaiju. The baby is unable to survive outside the womb and dies after eating Chau. This allows Geizler and his skeptical colleague Hermann Gottlieb to merge with the baby kaiju's brain, where they discover the secret controlling the flow of kaiju through the portal.<br/><br/>The Jaeger forces reassemble, planning to use the nuclear warhead to destroy the portal once and for all. Pentecost, revealed to have been one of the original Jaeger pilots, takes command of Striker Eureka as one of its usual pilots was injured during the defense of Hong Kong. Pentecost ventures out into the ocean depths, with Raleigh and Mako supporting him aboard Gypsy Danger. Geizler and Gottleib inform them that the portal has a fail-safe system to control the passage of kaiju, which will only allow them entry if they can mimic the genetic code of a kaiju. Before they can process this information, they are attacked by a pack of kaiju, including the largest kaiju in recorded history. Pentecost detonates the warhead, destroying his Jaeger and its pilots, in order to kill the remaining kaiju guarding the portal. Raleigh and Mako seize the corpse of a dead kaiju and use it to pass through the portal, intending to overload Gypsy Danger's nuclear reactor to use it as an improvised bomb. With the Jaeger critically damaged from the fight, Raleigh ejects Mako and manually overrides Gypsy Danger's safety protocols before ejecting himself. Gypsy Danger detonates on the other side of the portal, destroying it and the alien commanders, as the two pilots emerge safely back on the Earth's surface.<br/><br/>i would really give this movie 9/10 for its super action and vivid monster,really this movie worth's your time and money."
"sandiglendinning","8","3","9","13 July 2013"," Monster movie par excellence!
","O dear God! Some horrible things are happening! Huge alien creatures called Kaiju have mysteriously popped out of the ocean and started stomping all over the humans! Humans decide to approach this problem by constructing giant robots (Jaegers) to stomp the monsters right back. Now years into the Kaiju war, the program is about to be replaced by a dodgy wall building plan. Raleigh Beckett one time top gun Jaeger pilot is headhunted by his old boss Stacker Pentecost (sexy 'ole Idris Elba ladies!). Things have become desperate the Kaiju are becoming larger and more prolific as humanity's last stand rapidly approaches. The remnants of the Jaeger program, a rag tag band of crack pilots, loopy scientists and frazzled techies must now save the world using only their vintage Jaegers, brains and grit!<br/><br/>Human performances are as good as they can be while being utterly dwarfed by the monstrous stars of this show. Themes are quite male oriented for the most part centering on father/son, friendship and brotherly relationships. This focus on the intimate and familial relationships between the lead characters contrasts nicely with the towering apocalyptic grandiosity that surrounds them. There is comic relief from resident mad scientists Newton and Gottlieb and also in the form of a fantastically fun cameo from Ron Pearlman as gangster Hannibal Chau. <br/><br/>The few ladies that appear in this movie are as tough as nails. Japanese Jaeger pilot Mako is a very respectable female lead she's smart and as tough as the manly specimens who surround her. It's absolutely wonderful to see a female character as capable as her in a summer blockbuster, Well done GdT for espousing widespread ethnic diversity in casting and the inclusion of strong female characters too, that is VERY nice to see.<br/><br/>Now on to what this film is all about, HUGE robots fighting AWESOME monsters! The attention to detail in production is absolutely stunning in this film. The Jaegers look battered, grungy and battle fatigued. Effects like this take a keen eye and a lot of attention to detail. You get a true sense that these are ageing veteran battle-bots who are the last of their kind. There were mutterings of comparisons to Gundam amongst the guys I went along with. The Kaiju are likewise worthy adversaries with respectful references to vintage Godzilla the obvious comparison. The Jaegers and Kaiju literally eat up the screen, Pacific Rim is THEIR movie and I can only salute GdD and the team that brought them to life so wonderfully. <br/><br/>Who would enjoy this film? I think pretty much anybody. Kiddies are going to pee their pants over this, I think if I was a kid it would probably be the coolest thing I ever saw. I watched it with four male friends and my 17 year old son and they all absolutely loved it, it was opening night and there were not that many women in the theatre so I can only offer my own opinion that it was fantastic and that women will also enjoy it (The fact that 'Driss Elba looks so damn fine in his Jaeger armor didn't influence my opinion at all of coursenonever!) <br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? Go see this right now, it's THE blockbuster of the summer. Unmissable!"
"lordjord96","9","3","9","13 July 2013"," Pacific Rim: Who needs maturity nowadays?
","7 months ago, when I first heard about 'Pacific Rim' I had my doubts. First of all I thought that the Robot VS Monster battles wouldn't work out, and then I thought that this wasn't the kind of film Guillermo Del Toro should be directing. Alas, last night all my doubts were washed away!<br/><br/>Pacific rim is a triumph of sci-fi monster/action films. The film starts with a prologue to explain how and why the planet has changed, to tell us just why we need to defend ourselves. Admittedly, the truth was horrifying; giant monsters (called 'Kaiju) had bridged our dimension to theirs, and they were coming to get us. In the first sequence we get a sense of the scale of this as the Kaiju topple buildings and obliterate our standard military forces. Then, however, we get to see our own scaled-up war machine; The Jaeger robots. We are given an incredible sequence in which we see the pilots of the US's Gypsy Danger Jaeger being assembled in preparation for battle. The pilots' minds combined in control over the mighty machine. This was so much epic at once, I almost cried.<br/><br/>Del Toro's triumph isn't just scale, however. Despite all of our successes against the invasion, we ARE NOT invincible. This is, honestly, rather scary. The Kaiju start beating us badly (as we see when one of our supposedly triumphant Jaegers is almost torn to pieces), and ALL of our defences start to fail. The walls we build crumble within an hour of being attacked, and our Jaegers have to be brought out of retirement, only to be battered again and again. This made me feel scared, I wondered how we would deal with this threat today, and whether or not WE could adapt before they did.<br/><br/>But scary monsters aside, this film delivered action in ways I have never seen before. It's amazing to see colossal robots fighting colossal monsters like that in 'Pacific Rim'. The fights aren't speedy, having to carry the weight of it's participants, and we are continuously placed in the middle of them so that we can see just how much damage is being done; to the fighters AND our pilots. There was not a single second where I wasn't absolutely amazed by the strength of the CGI, and how it all felt so astonishingly real. When the Jaeger was hurt, you could see it was hurt, same for the Kaiju. And yet, surprises are thrown at us throughout as our strengths become weaknesses and vice-versa. Del Toro did a great job of turning the emotional pilot-bonds into a will to fight and survive. The emotions at the base known as the 'Shatterdome' are taking into battle, crippling some fights but strengthening others. <br/><br/>The cinematography was also exceptional. When the waters of the pacific ocean filled the screen, when waves pushed Jaegers and Kaijus back and forth, when buildings fell and cars exploded, I could have actually been in the film. I didn't see it in 3d of IMAX (if it isn't filmed in IMAX or d, I won't waste my money seeing it in those formats), but that didn't detract from my complete immersion into the battle sequences. As we see lights illuminate the waters and Kaijus causing almost tsunami- scale waves to burst forth, I was utterly entranced by the power of this film's CGI; it was the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I can't really comment on acting, because most of the acting, in my opinion, was done by the Jaegers and Kaijus in the battles. Idris Elba certainly had an authority about him, and Charlie Hunman was clearly scarred by the loss of his brother in a Jaeger-crippling battle, but that didn't matter too much to me because, after all, I was there for the action.<br/><br/>I would have liked a few less emotional scenes, admittedly, as they did seem to be out of place at times (Why there have to be a fight between Raleigh and Chuck over a girl I don't know), and the comedic battles between two scientists with two different solutions did detract from the action slightly due to their placement during the middle of some battles. Their humour also fell flat on the audience at times, leading to some pointless cutaways that should have been cutaway from the final edit of the film.<br/><br/>'Pacific Rim' was so much better than I expected it to be. In the beginning I thought it looked a bit, well, naff. I didn't like the sequencing too much, but I have a feeling that was intentional, to make us feel that the scale of the problem wasn't that impressive, until later on when it becomes clear that it is. I honestly believe that what Del Toro has done is created one of the best Sci-fi films in this decade, n#and I know for sure that the Kaiju are my favourite movie monsters of all time. If you go into this expecting anything other than close-up, over the top, reference-filled, anime and Godzilla homage-d action, then think again. This film made me feel like a 6 year old playing with my monster and robot toys on the carpet, and I really like that feeling; 8.9/10."
"jointerceptor","8","3","9","13 July 2013"," Watch this movie and you won't have to watch any other action film for a while
","Wow!! This movie delivered everything i wanted from it. Big gigantic aliens vs big gigantic robots, no guy can say no to that. It kind of felt like i was watching some Godzilla movie, but it was 10 times better. The cgi in my opinion was top notch. Some people might say there wasn't enough character development or there wasn't enough plot, i honestly did't care while i watched it. To me i think it was just right. I will be looking out for more of the director's upcoming films from now on.<br/><br/>Idris Elba gave a really fantastic performance. Every scene he was in his presence and his voice,full of authority, gave me the chills. I think Mr. Elba could've been a pretty good Nick Fury in the Avengers if Samuel Jackson was not available.Rinko Kukuchi in my opinion did an okay job. There were some scenes where i couldn't understand what she was saying, so i was wondering how on earth the other person talking to her could. Some of her acting as well in some scenes felt a little awkward, but not too bad because Mr. Elba and Mr.Hunnam was there to help improve her acting. Later on in the film i think she gave a much better performance with Charlie Hunnam while they were in the cockpit of their robot. Overall, the movie is fantastic piece of work and i would not want to ask for a sequel, because most of the time sequels just ruin the whole feeling of the movie. If they still do plan to make a sequel i think they should never leave out Guillermo del toro, or it'll just fail in my opinion. I am definitely buying this film when it comes out on bluray, and i normally don't buy any films at all"
"darkstar007","9","3","9","12 July 2013"," I do not have high expectations for this movie
","I must say that with the lack of major promotional support (i mean a lot of people i talked to did not even know about this movie)i did not have very high expectations for this movie. I just figured that the studio figured it was going to be a bust but they would release it anyway but decided to save a few advertising dollars.<br/><br/>But i was so wrong. This has got to be one of the best action movies to come out this year. The CGI is almost flawless, the action sequences are great. The first 90 minutes are just pure movie gold. The last 30 are not as good. But boy is this movie one hell of a thrill ride of a movie. I highly recommend it, and do not listen to the critics make your own decision and my bet is that you will thoroughly enjoy it too"
"FairlyAnonymous","9","3","9","11 July 2013"," Extremely awesome yet a bit rushed
","I have been eagerly awaiting the release of Pacific Rim for many months, after being able to see it I can say that the movie was (surprise) fantastic. The fights were visually impressive, the sets were detailed and gritty, the costume designs were good, and the plot wasn't bad (which was what I was afraid of). The movie is very enjoyable, however I will say it did have some flaws that kept it from being the perfect movie I had hoped for. I will list the flaws first, so that way I can end my review with all of the positives.<br/><br/>The Pacing: In all honestly this should've been two or three movies. The movie throws many concepts at the audience and yet it never goes fully in depth with any of them (save for a few that are vital to the plot). In one of the scenes a guy is being chased by a kaiju due to an experiment, however it isn't explained fully why the kaiju is chasing him. Another scene (spoiler) shows that one of the kaijus is pregnant. I was expecting that this would lead to capturing one of the babies (which was a goal that the main scientist wanted at the beginning) or possibly this would allow people to actually control a kaiju much like a jaeger. However the baby kaiju are used for nothing other than a little bit of comedy and as a plot device to add some tension.<br/><br/>There are many things in this movie which would've been interesting if expanded on. I understand that this movie was kind of a risk, so I know that they couldn't make three movies, however there are a lot of ideas that are important to the plot, yet are only on screen for several minutes. Such as the after effects of being in The Drift alone. What are the side-effects? Why do they occur? What kind of emotional trauma can it do to a person? Other questions such as: how come the ""coastal wall"" is brought up so briefly and then it disappears very quickly? This movie is full of ""unfinished"" concepts. <br/><br/>My last gripe about the pacing revolves around the extra pilots. The movie establishes that there were a lot of jaegers, and it shows a large cast of pilots. It would've been very interesting to have gotten to see each jaeger in action more and for character interaction with the other pilots. However, if the movie had all of the character interaction that I wanted then it would easily have been a 4 hour long movie.<br/><br/>Clichés: I won't lie, this movie does have a bunch of clichés in it. Being cliché isn't always a bad thing, and this movie is actually able to use clichés to its advantage. For people who don't read mangas, watch anime, or watch old Godzilla movies; they probably won't understand that some of the irrational behavior of the characters are typical in mangas and anime. This gives the movie a sort of ""real life anime"" feeling which very few movies have ever been able to accomplish. Some people will see this as stupid, and others will enjoy it. I enjoyed it for the most part.<br/><br/>The Positives: Visuals: This movie must be seen in 3D. I saw Avatar, How to Train Your Dragon, The Avengers and many other movies in 3D and this movie takes the grand prize for the best use of 3D I have ever seen. The movie is just simply gorgeous to look at, and it is obvious that a lot of work and talent went into making this movie look fantastic. The water effects are extremely realistic and everything IS JUST SO COOL TO WATCH!!! The very first battle was one of the most amazing fight scenes I have ever seen (I actually smiled in the movie theater during every fight scene... it is a very good looking movie).<br/><br/>I will go on a little bit more about the visuals. The kaiju themselves are very well designed. Each one is unique from the others and seems to fill its own niche. Some have blades for a head, some fly, others are like giant gorillas etc. and each one is just as entertaining to watch as the next. The jaegers are very nice looking as well, however the movie doesn't spend as much time as I would've liked on the other jaegers. <br/><br/>The Action: The flow of the action in this movie is good. This isn't just about how the visuals look in the action, but actually what is happening in the action. Transformers suffered from great visuals but uninteresting action. Fortunately, this movie succeeds in both great visuals and great action. All of the fights are clever, unique, and crazy awesome.<br/><br/>The Acting: All of the actors did a great job in this movie, however I will say that sometimes the acting was a little bit over the top at times. I will mention (I said this earlier) that this movie appears to be more like an anime/comic in the sense of how the characters act. All of the acting is good, it just depends if you like what they are portraying or not. Another nice thing is that most of the actors here aren't extremely famous. I like seeing new faces on the screen.<br/><br/>Verdict: Pacific Rim is an extremely entertaining movie that understands how to make good action and how to make a monster movie. All of the parts of the movie are very interesting, sadly the movie is just too short to be as good as it could be. If there was more character interaction, more struggles with the past, actual character development, and more expansion of the Pacific Rim universe; then this movie would've been perfect.<br/><br/>Either way, go see Pacific Rim and enjoy the ride."
"tracer8410","8","3","9","11 July 2013"," When it comes down to it, this movie is just a damn fun time.
","I had certain expectations going into Pacific Rim – I just wanted to see giant robots (known as Jaeger in the movie) and giant monsters (known as Kaiju in the movie) fight. I wasn't going to mind if the characters were meaningless vessels solely to move the story along as long as the giant action scenes were done correctly, because that's what this movie is for. If I were to give you the plot of this movie I would tell you the only thing that matters is the action, and if you go into this movie with the same expectations as me, you're going to get exactly what you bargained for.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro directs this film and he does a great job at making every single action scene seem huge. Every hit in the movie packs a punch, and a hard one at that. The Jaeger vs. Kaiju battles do not disappoint in the slightest and are helped hugely by the great special effects work. The CGI in the film is top notch and makes every high- octane scene that much more intense. Not to mention the sets that the actors are in inside of the Jaeger are practical. The fact that they took the time to build sets for the actors instead of just putting them in front of a green screen is something to appreciate, and adds to the film's realism.<br/><br/>The Kaiju are so interesting to look at, from the effects work yes, but also out of the different designs of each one. Some of them walk, some swim, and some fly but they all look fantastic. Seriously, I couldn't help smiling seeing these things battle, it's everything the inner child in me could want. It's completely over the top, but everything in this movie is, right down to the script and acting.<br/><br/>Charlie Hunnam stars as our main protagonist and, although not awful, he definitely wasn't anything memorable. Anyone could have played his character. There were only 2 standouts in this movie to me – Idris Elba and Charlie Day. Elba brought a presence of force and power that the movie obviously needs, but is also the most human out of all the mostly hollow characters. Also, that guy's mustache is awesome. Just look at that thing. If I had a list of favorite mustaches, his would be towards the top. But, in my opinion, Charlie Day steals the whole movie. Maybe it's just because I'm a fan of his, but I absolutely loved every time his character was on screen. He was hilarious, but he also served as an important part of the story. That being said, whenever the movie focused on any other characters it slowed down for me because I didn't care about them as much. Luckily, the two get a lot of screen time to balance it out.<br/><br/>Honestly, there's not much more to say about Pacific Rim. The film follows up with exactly what it advertises – giant, incredible action. A more refined human element would have been appreciated (and if the movie had it, it would be phenomenal), but the movie is entertaining enough in its action to look past that. When it comes down to it, this movie is just a damn fun time.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim - 4/5"

I was very sadly mistaken.

It tries to meld the topics of many of the 60's Japaneses greats like Godzilla and Godzilla Vs Gamora but with a more mature cast.<br/><br/>The acting is either well over acted or well underacted, even the extras are over acting which gives the case of very poor direction and the story line is as bad as the acting.<br/><br/>Some people reviews this stating they needed to watch this in the mind of a 10 year old, well I agree to a certain extent, the difference is even at my age now I can happily watch the 60's greats many times over and enjoy them, this I would not want to see ever again. <br/><br/>It just didn't make it on any level. I am trying not to give anything away but it does not meet any criteria of a Sc-Fi let alone just a decent movie.<br/><br/>I would even think kid's of today would expect more than this delivers so I wouldn't even show it to any children.<br/><br/>A total waste of my time and this is the first bad review I have written but feel that as some how it has received a 7, someone really needs to bring it back into perspective."

","Terrible movie in every sense. Of course it looks great, but even if you take this as a purely entertaining action-movie it fails on every other level than expensive CGI, and there is nothing new at all in this movie. <br/><br/>Story? - Aliens fight vs. Machines piloted by humans + the usually lame romance and some characters you don't care about dying + the usually lame crazy scientists helping the military guys. Characters? none interesting Action? - The same fights over and over again, only the monsters get bigger over time. Music? - disgusting Also it wounds me every time to see Stringer Bell playing the same stupid military role again and again.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good entertaining action flick go watch the new Dredd, Ironman or even some xmen movie but not this crap."

","Pacific Rim is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.The film is without a doubt one that sci-fi fans will be pleased with,it's filled with giant robots fighting giant monsters,it is done so well but it also feels inspired,it dosen't feel like they made those scenes for the purpose of making money but because it was something they genuinely were interested in creating.If the action wasn't enough,this movie still manages to give terrific character development,something you certainly wouldn't expect from a movie like this,but you do really get the know the humans and to feel emotion for them,this movie gets extra points for doing that successfully while still focusing on action and high quality effects,because you would rarely see both of those things done well in this type of movie.The cast is outstanding,Idris Elba is certainly the most experienced actor,but I also really like Charlie Hunnam and Charlie Day,an actor best known for Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Horrible Bosses,I never expected to see him in a movie like this,but he did a great job and his character was certainly the funniest.Pacific Rim is an outstanding movie (that I really hope they make a sequel to),Guillermo del Toro was clearly inspired to make this movie,I would never expect a movie with robots and monsters to be so good in a point of view of character development and story,but this really was and I would highly recommend it to all moviegoers.<br/><br/>When an attack on giant monsters threatens the end of the world,some giant robotic machines as big as the monsters ran by professionals is the only way to put a stop to them.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Idris Elba"

I can just imagine them pitching the idea to the studio executives with that line and pointing out that it would also appeal hugely to the all important Chinese market. Really it succeeds admirably for what it is but it ain't Chekov.<br/><br/>The Good? Well you wanted giant monsters about to destroy instantly recognisable landmarks slugging it out with huge kickass robots built to stop them, you got them! And in spades! I would have liked their battles not to always take place in the middle of thunderstorms so we could see them a little more clearly but maybe the special effects weren't up to it? Nice to see Max Martini (who was always my favourite on The Unit) again although his Aussie accent needs some work. What was quite remarkable is that we have a father and son team and the father sends the son to die rather than the other way around, the ending to Independence Day in reverse? Also Idris Elba does sterling work, showing that giant monsters have absolutely no chance against his typically British stiff upper lip. I like the idea that humanity is on the ropes, that we're essentially in a Battle of Britain style situation, I always figured this is how we'd end a Cabin in the Woods style situation. <br/><br/>The bad?

"Buddy-51","7","2","5","11 December 2013"," Retro monster movie
","Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pacific Rim"" proves yet again that what was one generation's B-movie castoff is another generation's A-movie mainstay. It's a throwback to all those monster movies that played mainly in drive-ins in the 1950s - only here the budget is huge and the stop-motion and claymation techniques used back then have been replaced by the latest in CGI technology.<br/><br/>In this 21st Century edition, giant creatures have broken through the earth's crust and are stomping all over many of the planet's largest coastal cities (see ""Godzilla,"" ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,"" ""The Giant Gila Monster,"" etc. for the roots of these types of films). Humanity's response has been to create an army of giant metallic robots replete with two mind-melded human pilots at the controls (think of it as a WII version of a tank with arms and legs). Charles Hunnam, of ""Sons of Anarchy"" fame, is the hotshot pilot called out of self-imposed retirement - his co-pilot/brother was lost while on a previous mission - to help rescue the world. Rinko Kikuchi is his new partner with some unresolved issues of her own to deal with. Idris Elba, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini and Ron Perlman (I guess we know what the ""Anarchy"" boys were doing on their time off that year) round out the cast.<br/><br/>The plotting is nothing to write home about, and there is way more jabbering, soul-searching and speechifying than is probably called for in a movie such as this - but the intense action scenes, bits of comic relief, and rally-round-the-flag-boys heroics help the popcorn go down smoothly."

","Oh how I waited for this movie. The first trailer had me salivating in anticipation of this huge robot vs alien movie. I missed it at the cinema as I've two young children and I couldn't quite time a visit right with my buddies. <br/><br/>It reached the Sky Store last week so there I was last night, set up and ready for my night of entertainment. As an admirer of Del Toro, I was eagerly anticipating the moving in full confidence that he couldn't produce anything other than gold. I remember being mesmerised the first time I saw Pan's Labyrinth, followed by both Hellboy movies and other movies that he's been associated with including The Orphanage. All I very much enjoyed. <br/><br/>In a nutshell: can someone please explain to me when Del Toro started getting movie training from Michael Bay? This movie left me bitterly disappointed. The acting is woeful, and I mean from the first minute.. Watching the two cocky brothers swagger their way to their Jaeger was about as subtle as getting smashed in the face by a brick with a cliché attached. Predictable, shallow and down right insulting to anyone watching except your brain-dead Transformers fan. It couldn't get worse I thought. It did. The stereotyped Japanese girl with the tragic back story, Idris Elba (in his native accent which it seems some reviewers think is put on) doing his best to keep a straight face and those two 'flamin Austraaaalians'. Do me a favour, one is from Eastenders (UK) and the other one is American. The accents are terrible!! If you need Aussies, hire them. It's insulting to any viewer with an IQ higher than 100 and completely off-putting. Not to mention the dubbing clearly carried out in post-production.<br/><br/>The Jaeger effects are good, as are the Kaiju, however that is the only thing that stopped me from turning off the film. I'd like to give them more of a mention, but I'm still angry about how terrible the rest of the film is.

"movieboy2001","Null","2","5","21 October 2013"," Pacific Rim lacks intelligence, but makes up for it with eye candy and loud noises.
","Be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on themovieboy77.com<br/><br/>Pacific Rim takes place in the not-so-distant future. Where Monsters (referred to as kaiju- Japanese for Monster) are mysteriously coming out of a portal in the ocean. The humans counter attack with huge robots (referred to as jaeger-German for hunter), run by two humans, by connecting their minds through deep secrets and memories so they could synchronize their attacks.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty generic and the movie plays out like eye candy. It's easy on the eyes and very low on plot and emotion. You tend to not feel bad for the world because it just seems so easy for the monsters and the robots to destroy it. Obviously, millions are dying but who cares. We are basically watch huge robots and monsters fighting each other to the death ! What else is there that we should care about?<br/><br/>I will not take away points from a mindless summer action movie just because it's all action and no depth but I just felt like I couldn't care for anything or anyone who was having bad things happen to them. There was no emotional involvement or enough of a back story for me to get involved emotionally.<br/><br/>The actors seemed to be overacting at part and, at times, seemed to be very wooden. I'd feel worse for your character if you just showed me that you actually cared about what's going on. Charlie Day was fantastic as the comic relief. He plays a scientist who is an expert on the Kaiju. I believe Charlie Day is great in every movie he's in and his future is a bright one. You also have a very funny cameo from Ron Perlman, who you may know from Hellboy, who plays a black market Kaiju parts dealer. Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead, was also pretty bad ass. Although, through her intense emotional back story, you found it hard to care about what she went through. The characters don't react to it very well, which is disappointing because her story is the reason why she's involved in the project. Same goes for the lead, Charlie hunnam, who plays Raleigh Becket, who's emotional back story is the beginning to our story. After the beginning, you tend to forget what happens, as you are taken away through the epic battle scenes that take place.<br/><br/>I must say, the action scenes were breathtaking and the CGI was just spectacular. I had chills every time a battle scene between the robots and the monsters was happening. Although, at times, it seemed very hard to follow as everything was happening so fast. I did see it in IMAX 3D, which made the experience enjoyable in terms of sounds and feeling, but didn't help the movie as the darker scenes were the scenes that were harder to follow, and more of the fighting scenes happened in the dark and in water. Rain and splashes from water seemed to have gotten in the way of the blows between enemies which made it hard for me to be completely blown away.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim was your typical summer popcorn action flick. Lacking intelligence but making it up with visual eye candy and loud noises. Sometimes, that isn't always a bad thing. We expect this sometimes in summer movies. It's what we look forward to. For all of you thinking this is a Transformers rip-off, no need to worry. This is a smarter, darker take on mindless action. Not a lot of explosions or hot girls. Just something to have a little bit of fun with.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

The movie convincingly relates the big threat to humanity, the big communal response, the big industrial production, and the big adversary. This near future is even made plausible on the political, technological, and fantasy level. The movie fails, however, to escape the graphic novel origins. Where storyline development could have come through the explanation and development of the futuristic technology, it settles for unsurprising weaponry ""reveals""; where it could have entertained grand science fiction questions, it throws in another action scene; where it could have showcased large-scale action choreography, it focuses in on a punch landing or head being knocked backward. It belongs in the video game movie genre with all the flaws one expects to accompany such a label: weak storyline, repetitive action scenes, and cliché characters. It does fare better than expected in a number of categories: the acting was acceptable nor and the character development was less than ruinous. It was as shiny and glossy as one expects from a big budget motion picture of this sort, but the action scenes were sluggish and clunky. It matches up with Transformers in effects but is more Godzilla (1954) in terms of action choreography. I enjoyed it while I was in the theater, but I will not think fondly of it on the outside. I do not recommend the movie, but neither would I discourage those who desire a good solid two hours of big effects and mayhem.<br/><br/>Acting: 6/10 Cinematography: 7/10 Character Development: 5/10 Choreography: 3/10 Storyline: 6/10 Resonance: 1/10"

","""Hellboy"" director Guillermo del Toro and scenarist Travis Beacham have caught Michael Bay and his ""Transformers"" franchise napping with the release of ""Pacific Rim."" This entertaining but formulaic nonsense amalgamates science fiction with horror in an apocalyptic adventure epic that pits humans piloting giant robots against ""Godzilla"" type monsters from another universe. Imagine ""Godzilla"" meets ""Robot Jox,"" and you'll have a good idea what to anticipate from ""Pacific Rim."" When you aren't laughing yourself silly at the doomsday premise of mankind tangling with alien behemoths from another galaxy, you may find yourself caught up in the bombastic, larger-than-life action. Basically, ""Pacific Rim"" amounts to a slug fest between towering robots and amphibious leviathans that attack each other on both land and sea. Just because you haven't swamped a bathtub lately with a rubbery ducky in one fist and a huge plastic robot in the other doesn't mean that you won't enjoy this boisterous Armageddon. Comparatively, between the heroic humans and the ""Jurassic Park"" influenced monsters, del Toro creates more urban destruction than both ""The Avengers"" and ""Man of Steel."" Skyscrapers topple like dominos, and gigantic creatures rampage through a number of largely populated Pacific rim properties like tornadoes. In the hands of a talent lesser than del Toro, who also helmed ""Blade 2,"" ""Pacific Rim"" might not have been so amusing. The film's biggest asset isn't the impressive CGI gargantuan combatants, but its cheeky sense of humor. Meantime, the biggest problem this outlandish epic contends with is its largely unknown cast. Aside from veterans like Ron Pearlman and Idris Elba, who support rather than lead, nobody qualifies as a celebrity superstar. Charlie Hunnam has made one above-average thriller ""Deadfall"" and appeared in 70 episodes of ""Sons of Anarchy"" as Jackson 'Jax' Teller. Anybody who liked Steve McQueen will notice a stunning resemblance between Hunnam and the ""Bullitt"" star. Hunnam has all of McQueen's physical movements down, but his hair looks a mite long. Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi plays Hunnam's feisty co-star, and they wind up sharing more than merely physical space in this rock 'em sock 'em yarn. The beauty of unknowns in a mega-budget movie like ""Pacific Rim"" is that you're never certain whose going to survive.<br/><br/>This fast-paced, live-wire, sci-fi spectacle takes place about seven years from now in 2020. The worst thing that we face as a society then isn't suicidal terrorists. Instead, it's the Kaiju — massive, dinosaur-like, creatures from another dimension that emerge from a breach in the ocean floor to stomp the smithereens out of San Francisco, Manila and Cabo San Lucas. Initially, mankind tried to use conventional weapons on these supernatural mega-beasts. Unfortunately, more powerful weapons were required to repulse these pugnacious leviathans. All the scenes with the monsters trashing cities will evoke memories of the original Japanese Godzilla movies as well as the 1998 American remake with Matthew Broderick. Eventually, mankind cooperates on a global basis and constructs huge, 25-foot high, humanoid metal com-bots with cannons and lasers called Jaegers. Two pilots in tandem operate these man-made monsters with each acting as opposing neural hemispheres. Like the monsters, the Jaegers can 'take a licking and keep on ticking' in the drink as well as on land. The pilots wear space suits, wield their two minds as one in ""Star Trek"" mind-meld fashion, and control their robot from a sophisticated Wii platform built into the head-piece of the hulk. Two pilots are required because a Jaeger because one pilot cannot perform the tasks required without suffering long-term side-effects. When these robots are being prepared for combat, the pilots must establish a neural link between their minds so their memories and consciousness are bonded together by inboard hardware. As it turns out, Earth succeeds in repulsing their creatures. Nevertheless, the Kaiju haven't tossed in the celestial towel. They come back for one last fracas, and the best of the Jaegers confront them in a life and death battle in the north Alaskan Seas. Brothers Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff of ""After Earth"") and Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) wade into icy waters against the orders of their superior, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba of ""Thor""), to save a fishing vessel from the Kaiju. This Kaiju has a surprise in store for them when it rips the head-piece off the Jaeger and pulls Raleigh's brother Yancy out. Stunned and injured during the toe-to-toe fray, Raleigh manages to bring the Jaeger home and quits the program. He is a hull of his former self now that his brother is gone. The Jaeger program isn't far from extinct itself. The powers that be have decided that walls are the answer to the Kaiju. Every metropolis on the Pacific rim sets out to erect impenetrable walls. Unfortunately, nobody told the Kaiju and they smash through these immense walls like a blow torch through butter. Stacker searches for Raleigh and finds him toiling on a wall. Later, he introduces him to Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), and they assure Raleigh that he can drive another Jaeger. Stacker's scientists, Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day of ""Horrible Bosses"") and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman of ""Layer Cake""), are furiously working on ways to destroy these creatures when Mako announces she is the ideal candidate to help Raleigh operate a Jaeger. Stacker is initially hesitant to let her to double team with Raleigh in a Jaeger, but she wins him over to her side.<br/><br/>""Pacific Rim"" boasts more than just a bunch of robots battling prehistoric looking monsters. Charlie Day steals the show as an insane scientist who looks like Christian Slater crossed with Rick Moranis and brays like a jackass. Burn Gorman and he have a field day playing psychotic scientists. At one point, Dr. Geiszler decides to mind-meld with a fragment of a Kaiju's brain and realizes that Stacker's strategy of using a Jaeger to drop a nuclear device down the Pacific Ocean portal from where the monsters come isn't going to work. ""Pacific Rim"" is a monster of a mash."

","What a lot of us thought of when we played with our toys, I wasn't expecting this to be good, it was more of a 50/50 chance, glad it landed on heads (unlike a couple of movies this summer), because again, we see another blockbuster with visual effects as it's main attraction, Pacific Rim has has it-but it works incredibly well. It's an odd thing too, I always wanted to see a Giant Robot and Alien Monster beat the crap out of each other in a movie of this era, and not only do we now have a modern film of that subject, but it's actually good. I'm not going to go into details of what go's on in the story, so I will say it's an original bad- ass film, the cast was good-we see people he used from his other works like Ron Perlman (always a trip) and Santiago Segura, and new people like Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini etc. The story is simple as it needs to be, the human race sticking together to defend earth's civilization from colossal alien monsters with massive dual-piloted battle robots, and for once after countless sci-fi flops, this Sci-Fi follows it's story as it's told. As for what the monsters and robots look like, A.K.A. the Kaijus (Japanese for ""Strange Creature"") and the Jaegers (German for Hunter), they look kick- ass. The Kaijus look like Godzilla's lost array of evil cousins (I know it sounds odd but i'm geeking out right now), from Japanese inspiration, I couldn't expect more of a classic looking gang of sea-misfits than this. The Jaegers, Holy ****, I want one, I prefer these robots than most of the Bionicle-looking Autobots and Decepticons from Michael Bay's Transformers series, all of them have their own style to them, not to mention culture as well, and with the two battling each other, it looks Amazing. Realistic looking, half in half, at times there were shots where things would look real (like that one Kaiju destroying the Golden Gate Bridge, that scene were it grabs the bridge, that's frightening looking, that's a Nightmare), then at times you know it's very CGI, but you know, who cares, it's worth it. I'll lastly point out that most of you reading this are thinking, ""It wasn't that great"" or simply ""It Sucked"" (or you say this review sucks which I wouldn't blame ya my wording sucks), but for those over the top's, you reading this Film Critics, it's a movie for everyone to go to and enjoy, a Summer Movie, more importantly another Monster Great to add to Master del Toro's Collection."

","I just got back from screening, got my eyes raped and what an eyegasm it was !<br/><br/>Yes, it's not perfect (when was the last perfect film?) - certain flawed plot, some not so great dialogue, not-your-everyday actors, the final Category 5 Kaiju fight was a little short...but hey, it's summer! It's where the fun and action takes place, so go easy and light. That's the best way to enjoy this spectacular.<br/><br/>The CGIs were stunning, amazing and realistic. The film has it's touching moments too. It now makes Transformers looks like a kiddie ride (to a certain extend Avengers too). You can see and feel the action here where else Transformers (and Avengers) was way too fast for it's own good which resulted in being a bulky mess and loud junk. Kudos to Guillermo del Toro - as sometimes old school is a good school!<br/><br/>So Mr. Bay, the ball is in your court now. You have a chance to put things right with your next Transformers. Will you please hurry up and catch this but slow down on the action - just a little so that we can have an eye feast once again instead of going to a boom-boom-zip-pass grand illusion!?"

"jmpartin2","6","3","10","17 July 2013"," Major flaws with the Kaiju
","Perhaps my feeble understanding of genetics and basic biology are at fault here, but I cannot overlook the contradictory logic behind the Kaiju. Shortly into the movie, thanks to Dr. Newton Geiszler (the Kaiju expert/groupie who had a ""neuro handshake"" with one of the monsters) discovers that all Kaiju have the exact same DNA; that the Kaiju are in fact all clones of each other, being created by other alien beings.<br/><br/>If the Kaiju were clones with matching DNA, they would look exactly alike; however, no two Kaiju in the movie look alike. Secondly, if the Kaiju are essentially lab-created clones, a Kaiju pregnancy would not arise; however, this occurs in the movie as well.<br/><br/>My last point: the Kaiju are amphibious ocean-dwellers, adapted with bioluminescence and crustaceous shells...so why would there be an overtly gorilla-esque Kaiju? If the Kaiju are so great at ""evolving,"" (which also contradicts the clone theory) how and why would there be an obese gorilla-crab? Even with my limited knowledge of biology and zoology, I know gorillas are not renowned for their swimming ability (and by that, I mean they don't swim...at all)."
"norbertog55","10","3","10","16 July 2013"," Spectacular! Spectacular!
","I consider myself a pretty big fan of Guillermo Del Toro. I liked his unique vampire debut called CRONOS. I missed MIMIC and THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, but thought his BLADE II was a hell of a good time. Then he amped up the Blockbuster juice when he made HELLBOY and HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY. Both have fantastic performances from Ron Perlman, a great fantasy sensibility, and well crafted action sequences. But most people consider PAN'S LABYRINTH to be his masterpiece, and it's hard to argue with that. It's been 5 years since his last film (though he was slated to direct THE HOBBIT until Jackson took over). Well, now Del Toro is finally back and with a vengeance as he has made the biggest film of his career, PACIFIC RIM. Man, the universe that Del Toro has created here is so expansive that it's really hard to explain everything. There's just so much! Hmmm. How the hell do I do this? .okay.. So the movie is set in the future. A bunch of gigantic monsters from another dimension called Kaijus, have risen from a portal deep in the ocean. These beasts attack the coastal cities and threaten the very existence of man. To fight the Kaiju, the humans have created a bunch of gigantic robots called Jaegers. These robots are controlled by at least 2 humans at a time. The cockpit is in the head and the pilots are on some sort of treadmill-like machine that make the robots move exactly how they are moving. Also, the pilots are connected by the mind, so they can move as one. This is called ""Drifting"", which allows each pilot to enter the other's mind. It may sound like a bit to take in (and it is) but it's all pretty well explained in detail during the extended 17 minute prologue. (And thank you Mr. Del Toro for actually having the title appear in the beginning of the film!)."
"sweetypavi","4","3","10","16 July 2013"," PACIFIC RIM – Oh My God - Giant Robots Fighting Dinosours!
","Every time I watch a Bollywood flick, I top it up with a Hollywood one. That way, it leaves a good after-taste, a more balanced outlook towards the dream sequence that these moving reels churn out.<br/><br/>And for the last couple of weeks, week after week, as the overall score of a Bollywood flick has been improving, the Hollywood things haven't been able to stand up to the tall expectations that they project so well.<br/><br/>And the real low down is this movie called Pacific Rim almost $180M and for what, just converting a (may be) some sci-fi fantasy of a school kid into a big budget movie. The much touted, idiosyncratic director Guillermo Del Toro has gone into an overdrive some how, churning out movie after movie.. but this one is real let down. <br/><br/>If he has this Kaiju crush, why doesn't he make a movie that he can project on his sitting room wall for his kids. Robots fighting dinosaurs – HUHHH..<br/><br/>The movie reminds me of the Giant Robot, the stupid Japs serial that we used to be hooked to in those days of DOORDARSHAN. But then, not now. Not after 4 decades. We don't need these toys and the underwater Jurassic creatures coming from the center of earth (remember the bombed – journey to the center of earth). I mean, what the hell these guys think we are.. but what ever they thought we were.. we truly are : why then do you think I proved my self while I actually paid (my hard earned – PIZZA KHA LETA YAAR) to see this movie in the opening weekend itself. I have another theory – I think the Japs have conspired and are trying to sell their idea of giant robots,.. with their big factories and industrial houses like Kawasaki, etc. out of work and nuclear power stations shut!<br/><br/>Honestly, the comparison, in recent times, should be with 'Battleship'.. the great American mambo-jumbo ----- I thought that would be the worst of the worst movies in recent times, but they proved me wrong, again.<br/><br/>So what to do? While I initially got or at least tried to get little interested, it was a sheer waste of time, money and effort (to go and stay attentive)! As the metal boys started screeching and the 'marshal' started ordering the defense of the world from KAIJU (typically American (or is it Mexican) again – although, they didn't show their Prez this time trying to stay in the white house ready to go down), I got a signal that seemed to emanate from the fringe of the 6 billionth hyperspace on the 11th dimensional space, that nudged me into deep but somber yet comfortable sleep. <br/><br/>I woke up, when the world was saved, KAIJU were out (for the time being – trust Guillermo Del Toro to churn out the sequel to resurrect them once again in – Pacific Rim 2 : Indian Ocean) and the new marshal declared 'turn of the clock' or something. As the doors opened, I rushed out towards a new day-light, thanked God for saving us from ----- Guillermo Del Toro!!! (BTW, he resembles the Hellboy that he created)"
"seularts","10","3","10","16 July 2013"," Top 1 Movie for this year
","All I have to say is this, Pacific Rim made it right next to Armageddon and I swear this will not disappoint anyone.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie stands up from the story line. It's original, makes very good reference to many other movies in the past (Godzilla and maybe Cloverfield) and brings in true heroes with actual backbone stories of their own. Not to mention anime and mecha references regarding the freaking robots.<br/><br/>There are a few mistakes here and there, like how could the pod sustain the depth pressure of the Pacific or who in the right mind would decommission a project that protects people with robots, I hardly think money was supposed to be the issue for those leaders, but meh it's not impossible to be lead by idiots this days.<br/><br/>Second of all, the acting was flawless and we are presented with humor, drama, action even a bit of horror. All in all, this is a movie for a top 10 star reward here on IMDb. I recommend it with all my heart, just go see it and be happy about it."
"xenonum","5","3","10","16 July 2013"," Where is the logic ?
","Well lets keep this short. I am an engineering student and I did not expect this to be a logical film. I am not some kind of snob that wants logic from a movie about godzillas and robots. No, I wouldn't do that. So keep in mind I just went to see action packed movie with my friends. We saw it in 3D and the visuals were great. First 20 minutes its an CGI masterpiece. You can feel the fear from giant creatures just tearing city apart. Jaegers, robots, are really awesome. I mean in logical way. They have power and everything. But I will skip all this in review and concentrate on 2 scenes. Spoiler alert: after a long fight with the flying kaju,after it tore the robot apart and lift it a km in the air they decided to pull out the sword and kill it with one swing. I mean after all that fighting and everything they remembered..oh we have an instakill sword...that was the 1st scene and destroys that realistic side of film. The script was there just to raise suspense. Last scene: I expected 2 main characters to kiss. NO. They hug. I mean: You have explosions and dying and you can't make a sex scene. It's not that I am found of nudity in movies but it would make them more realistic. But the main character is a boy scout, and main female character is a little girl. Its just the way they are portrayed. I know this all seems random but sum of what I said is a 5. And it deserves it. Its a film that has really good twists on the side story's like (spoiler) 2 doctors. Its for hardcore anime fans and 14 year old's. It's a massive movie that's really great considering that its about a genre that's questionable to film at all. BUT, it's not 8/10. It's saying like its Matrix or Rain man. People on IMDb need to know what are they comparing this action movie to. It's like Jurrasic park but goofier, a lot."

"lee-anthony","6","3","10","15 July 2013"," am I getting too old?
","Maybe I am getting too old. This is absolute drivel. Had so many Hollywood movie clichés I was cringing through out the whole film. I would love to go into depth about what I mean but it gives away pretty much everything that happens in the film but if you have seen top gun its pretty much that. Also it has one of the biggest movie plot flaws right at the end of the film that I just cant get out of my mind. Hollywood also tends to either make a brit in the film a villain or a complete cretin. Point and case in the form of Burn Goman. He was great in Torchwood but in this he was a dithering fool that I can only assume was put in there as comic relief that never worked.<br/><br/>Idris Elba though was the stand out performance for me with an outstanding scene were he put down the hero so it wasn't all bad. The fight scenes were also pretty good and not as much as a mess as the transformer films were you cant tell whats going on as one robot melds into another. There was none of that here. It was good old mech on Japanese creature porn. So if they release it on DVD just edited down to the fight scenes id buy it. but leave in the story which is just top gun sci fied up a bit and the terrible acting I wont be sad if every copy is burnt in a fiery blaze by Godzilla's cousin."

"scott-225-267250","8","3","10","13 July 2013"," Beautiful, sexy, exciting, funny, and made me feel like a kid again!
","Pacific Rim is good, dumb summer fun. It's beautiful, sexy, exciting, funny, and it kinda made me feel like a kid again. The premise involves Kaiju and Jägers scratch that. Let's call it like it is: this movie is about big robots fighting big monsters. The monsters come from another dimension, entering our world from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The robots, each manned by two psychically linked people (often blood relatives), are humanity's last hope for survival. The concept sounds like the germ of another big, loud, stupid summer movie — you know, the kind Michael Bay makes. But director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth) handily beats Bay at his own game with Pacific Rim, imbuing the film with more style and substance than any of Bay's Transformers movies ever had.<br/><br/>Del Toro sets the tone of the film right away, and you have the option of embracing it or going home. It's a stylized comic book movie for kids and kids at heart. The sets, wardrobe, and cheeky supporting performances all encourage you to set your cynicism aside. As a kid of the 1980s, I was glad to see a fanciful approach to big-budget action flicks again. Del Toro's approach lets him get away with more poetic license and suspension of disbelief than Bay or Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) can afford themselves — their hyper-real approach to fantasy film making is old-hat now, anyway.<br/><br/>There are two more ways in which Del Toro shows up his contemporaries here. One is in visual and editorial style. I thank the movie gods that this movie isn't orange and teal. Del Toro embraces every color of the rainbow and I applaud him for it. (This shouldn't be a big deal, but it is!) And unlike much of Bay's work or Zack Snyder's abominable Man of Steel, I can actually discern what is happening shot-to-shot in Pacific Rim. The battle sequences aren't incomprehensible blurs like they are in those other movies, and I have to think it's probably because Del Toro is more confident in his narrative, staging, and composition.<br/><br/>Finally, and most importantly, Pacific Rim distinguishes itself from the pack by having likable characters that I cared about. Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) carries the movie very well, demonstrating charisma in addition to smoldering good looks (thank you, Guillermo, for the gratuitous shirtless scenes!) After his Jäger co-pilot and brother (Diego Klattenhoff) is killed, Hunnam's character strikes up a new bond with his training instructor (Rinko Kikuchi), who is haunted by memories of her own. The supporting characters are all stereotypes of one kind or another, but they add personality and charm to the proceedings. I especially liked Idris Elba as the Jäger pilots' commander and Ron Perlman as a Kaiju black-market organ dealer. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman bring comic relief as two bickering scientists, while Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky are memorable as Australian father/son Jäger co-pilots who never give up the good fight — not even when their robot loses power.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is meant to be surface-level entertainment, but while watching its international cast of characters make a unified effort to save the planet, I was struck by something mythologist Joseph Campbell once said: ""We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet."" I was also struck by the depiction of military leaders working with scientists to solve a mutual problem. It may just be my liberal heart beginning to glow after years of dormancy, but if our kids want to see big, stupid Hollywood movies, this robot/monster free-for-all is not without moral value."
"j-rahul-rao","8","3","10","13 July 2013"," THE Greatest C.G.I. Spectacle in years... The last time I was this impressed by Visual Effects was in 2009, AVATAR!
","Oh boy... Oh boy... Oh boy... Where do I begin? The problem with having very high expectations for a movie is that the higher your expectations are, the greater the chances are of you being disappointed. When I saw the this movie's trailer for the first time, a few months ago, I was in awe, and by the time I walked into the theater the last night my expectations had only increased, multi-fold... <br/><br/>So, did it live up to my expectations, was I impressed? Hell Yeah! As much as I will ever be... So much that, to me, this movie proves that Guillermo del Toro is the master of Epic (Visual Effects) Grandeur. The only other movie whose visual effects impressed me this much is 'Avatar'.<br/><br/>The story is basic (but good nonetheless), the movie is of moderate duration, and the screenplay is precise... So there isn't a dull moment in the film. There isn't a weak link on the acting front either, Idris Elba stands out though. The background score by Ramin Djawadi deserves a special mention. But finally, as you can see from the trailers, this movie is all about epic, grandiose scale visual effects, the kind you've never experienced before. And yes,this movies IS worth watching in 3D! <br/><br/>So, all in all, what's my final advice?? Don't miss it for the world, this might as well be the best movie to release this summer!"
"i-Shuvo","8","3","10","13 July 2013"," Two thousand five hundred tons of awesome
","Just by seeing the trailer of the movie Pacific Rim, one must have anticipated a lot of great action. Such giant robots have never been seen and the best thing is that it has been directed by Guillermo del Toro who is phenomenal when it comes to visual effects. The first look of Kaiju, the monster will let you know that your decision of watching it in a theatre is nowhere wrong. Two thousand five hundred tons? Well, it looks like that and when it roars you know it is an enormously giant monster. So is the impression hen these monsters fight and make global destruction.<br/><br/>To fight them, we have equally giant and titanic proportioned robots in Pacific Rim movie. The metallic skyscrapers makes us believe they can definitely fight with equal ferocity and kill the monsters. The best thing is that much effort has gone to make the audience feel the enormity and gigantic size and density of these robots. It is done marvellously and one may feel it as they move slowly and ominously conveying their enormous power.<br/><br/>Talking about the cast of Pacific Rim, Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket is really good in his character. The entire movie is crafted out in a manner that it is his story on an entirety. Idris Elba as the Marshal Pentecost is believable in his performance. The motivational speech he gives in the movie to his troops is really well delivered as well. Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori plays the new partner of Raleigh. With the looks she has been given, she personifies Anime and it was well enacted by her. There is a plenty of other supporting cast and mostly everyone has given a decent performance.<br/><br/>Overall, Pacific Rim is no doubt clichéd. The script is not remarkable but it is the direction of Guillermo del Toro that makes it special. For obvious reasons, no one will want to skip this movie or keep it for later stages home viewing. Thus there is no reason you are missing such an enormous violence on screen.<br/><br/>Another thing is that Pacific Rim offers a big relief from what the Transformer series have become lately. We seriously hope they do not end up making never ending installments for this movie as well. It is better off with just one installment only. The movie is stunning visually no doubt and that is why it is a must watch. Also, leave your brains outside of the theatre and go in just to visualize some impossibly sized monsters fighting ruthlessly and doing global destruction.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has definitely achieved that much in Pacific Rim movie. You will not get bored in the 131 min runtime and it will keep you thrilled till the end."
"ChristianUnchained","9","3","10","13 July 2013"," 9/10 - Guillermo Del Toro Brings Life Back To The Summer Blockbuster
","Enter Pacific Rim, a bold and fresh big summer blockbuster with completely original ideas and technologies, a unique and beautiful visual style, all featuring a time tested conflict and original characters. A bold promise, for sure. But Del Toro and the team have strung together what is quite possibly the best summer blockbuster in years, hands down without question.<br/><br/>What better aspect to talk about first than special effects? Oh man, are they absolutely splendid. The special effects are incredible, unreal at times. Jaegers are designed with intricate detail, glistening in the rain and snow and sleet that they fight in and are brought to life with incredible realism. Moments outside of the action are fantastic too, combining amazing sets and gorgeous backdrops to carry the neo-sci fi style throughout the film. The Kaiju are brought to life with ferocity and gruesome majesty; these big hulking meanies are awesome, ridiculously cool and fun to watch completely obliterate cities. Del Toro is known for his monsters, and Pacific Rim doesn't disappoint. <br/><br/>One of the other high points is the incredible level of detail seen throughout the film. Every fight scene is sensory overload, with a huge amount of detail from realistic physics applied to building chunks, cars, and other structures that give a sort of tangible weight that is missing from most films of the same genre. The remarkable visuals, produced by Industrial Light and Magic (a sub-division of LucasFilm) has done the impossible: they have brought movie magic to the screen, drenched in class and style unseen in just about every single summer blockbuster for the past few years. <br/><br/>And then there is the earth shattering, bone crushing, kaiju smashing action fight scenes. It's like Rock'em Sock'em robots on an unheard of scale, and it's perfectly balanced and respectively exciting to watch. I don't want to spoil anything, but the action scenes are just an absolute joy. An absolute, unadulterated, bring-out-your-inner-12- year-old JOY. And it proves that there can still be plenty of fun to be had in a gigantic summer blockbuster. And it simply never stops being a blast. Brining gigantic scale ideas to life is one thing, but putting that into motion, directing the action, the pacing, the character interaction so that it all combines into one incredible experience; Well, very rarely is that ever done welland here Guillermo struts his expertise and brings the fictional world of Pacific Rim to life. <br/><br/>But the action would fall flat and the pretty images would be filler if it weren't for a convincing human component and a little smarts, which Pacific Rim succeeds mostly to bring that dynamic to the screen. Is it convincing, well written, and well directed? I thought so, in that lovable cheesy summer B movie kind-of way. <br/><br/>The story follows Raleigh Beckett, a former Jaeger pilot out of luck after a major accident involving the kaiju. After some time to see how the other side works and lives, he's brought back to the jaeger team Gypsy Danger for one last crack attempt at stopping the Kaiju. The leading performances here are pretty good, most notably Idris Elba. His performance is strong, one that you can care for and is well written and acted. The rest of the cast, while there aren't any big name stars, is commendable on its diversity (one message that drives forward Pacific Rim), lovable cheesiness and well acted script. You can feel Guillermo's signature character writing style in every one. Despite how minor, they have a shining moment or two (and a laugh here and there!) Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philly) plays a hilarious comedic relief role but ends up being very important to the crux of the conflict. Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) does a swell job as the hero and Rinko Kikuichi (Babel, Sideways) is surprisingly strong and well acted as the heroine of the story. Plus, Ron Perlman plays a kaiju black market dealer and is hilarious; a caricature of modern businessmen. And Ellen McLain (Glados of the Portal Series) acts as the Jaeger AI and has a few portal jokes for fans.<br/><br/>The rest of the elements that make up Pacific Rim are strong too. Ramin Djawadi's epic score is equal parts bombastic and musically memorable. What's cool is that Ramin's score matches up with the action at most points, so major brass drops and orchestra hits line up with the massive smashing punches of the Jaeger vs. Kaiju fights, further producing a cool and very Hanz- Zimmer-y effect. The sound design for the film is top notch too. Sure, it's loud, but there is a method to the madness. Every smash, crash, and subtle movement is in the mix. Dialogue is strong too, and you never have to strain to hear the humans inside the Jaegers. It's a subtle layer that most moviegoers don't even notice, but I greatly appreciatebecause it's kind of hard to care about your characters when you can't hear them!<br/><br/>Is there anything inherently wrong with Pacific Rim? Well, personally, I would've loved to have seen just one more epic fight scene stuck somewhere in the film. But that extra baggage could've pushed the film to the near 3 hour mark. Beggars can't be choosers, I guess! Like I stated before, the characters are a little broadly drawn but it's a more than excusable flaw when the special effects start flooding in. <br/><br/>As I'm flipping through notes and playing the movie back in my head, I can't say that there wasn't a moment where I wasn't entertained. Sure, it's a relatively simple plot, but the level of fun I had in this big monster smash-hit overshadowed any nit-picks I had with the film. It's pure unadulterated entertainment from start to finish, and I wouldn't have Pacific Rim any other way.<br/><br/>9/10 – Golden Summer Award"
"nfranco1129","9","3","10","13 July 2013"," Pacific Rim
","I candy-colored dreamworld from the man who brought us the Hellboy series, Pan's Labyrinth, and Blade II, Pacific Rim tells the story of a world in the not-to-distant future in which a portal has been created that connects our world to the world of the Kaiju, a species of giant monsters who's objective in life is to conquer a world then more right on to the next one. In response, the world has pooled together it's resources to create monsters of our own, giant robots called Jaegers, to combat these creatures. Our story follows Raleigh, a once great fighter who is struck by tragedy and leaves the Jaegers program altogether until he is thrust back into war. <br/><br/>I'm not going to spend much time talking about the story and characters because they aren't really the point. However, that's not to say they are bad; they're just familiar. Charlie Hunnam really immerses himself into this role of the antagonist and delivers a performance that I personally really enjoyed. All of the acting in general was passable. Some of the dialogue wasn't great and filled with clichés, but despite that Del Toro finds a way to keep you invested enough to the point where you still really care about these characters. Much like the characters, the story is pretty formulaic as well, but again Del Toro crafts it in a way that allows audiences to sink their teeth in enough.<br/><br/>No surprise, where this film excels is in it's action scenes. Beautifully colored and spectacularly filmed, Del Toro reaches into the part of your brain that's still 12-years-old and entertains the hell out of it. Staying away from ""Transformeritis,"" Del Toro provides audiences with beautiful sweeping shots that allow us to really see how grand the whole spectacle is, making each hit all the more impactful and exciting.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is the summer blockbuster I've been longing to see. While all the others this summer seemed to focus on darker elements, Pacific Rim is monsters fighting robots at it's most basic form, from a director you can tell really cares. THis is the most fun I've had at the theater all year."

","The reason i go to the movies is to enter, just for a few minutes, in a world that we cannot see in real life. The giant monsters seen in the Sinbad movies, Godzilla, Gamera and other movies made my youth so much better. Years later the world became more cynic, and the cinema followed the same. Lost were the fun of yesterday and only the original Jurassic Park kept the spirit of the genre alive. Fast forward 20 years later, and Guillermo del Toro made a film almost impossible: a giant monsters vs giant robots with a heart (i.e.: not Transformers). I hope it inspire the same level of awe to a new generation of children, and ignite a wave of quality monster movies. With Godzilla just a year away, Pacific Rim is the best entertaining you can get until the king of the monsters movie next year. Not perfect but close enough, a sequel could only be better."

","Guillermo del Toro, the visionary director of Blade2, Pan's Labrinth and Hellboy has done the impossible. Large Robots...Large Monsters...and I COULD NOT WAIT FOR THIS FILM TO END SO I COULD LEAVE!. How do you screw up a movie with Charlie Hunnan, Charlie Day and Idris Elba? The answer is very simple: You make the movie for you, and not for the audience. This is Del Toro's guilty pleasure...like Tarantino's ""Sukyaki Western Django""...this is merely a collection of images and activities that Del Toro put to screen to entertain himself and himself alone. I am sure his preoccupation with Manga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) fueled this masturbatory CGI exercise. I actually felt as if i'd lost a few I.Q. points after sitting through what could only be referred to as the ""Battlefield Earth"" of the millennial generation. In closing, let me say that i'd rather do yard work, than sit through this film again."

","I've just watch Pacific Rim i'm going to give you a short review on what i thought no spoiler I promise :) . Right fact one is if you can see past the power ranger, transformer, Godzilla & independence day feel of the film, its surprisingly a fantastic film. <br/><br/>It has emotion moments with some pretty intense moments which balance the film out, a lot of thought & passion has gone into this film as it shows a lot about Honor & respect in combat situation. The C.G.I design on the creature's & the robot's were amazing & it has some of the best monster fight scenes that you will think wow!!!! that was awesome, but there is a slight twist in the story which I cant say because it will give away spoiler.<br/><br/>What I can say is I don't think this film will be for all, as I said if you can't get past the simple film mix you won't like this film or find it fantastic or entertaining. To me I loved this film for what it is, a very passionate, emotion action fight for survival film that really gives this film its edge. Film rating for me 8 out of 10."

","It occurred to me even as I watched it that PACIFIC RIM was a lifelong dream come true: a live-action version of the ASTRO BOY and GIGANTOR cartoons I'd watched as a child, done right. Del Toro doesn't waste a lot of time trying to infuse PACIFIC RIM with the kind of boring, pointless melodrama that most such movies engage in: he gets down to business early on and rarely strays from the program. (The jab at Modern Man's world-destroying efforts is appreciated.) Moviegoers who've waited for a true Summer Blockbuster will walk away satisfied, though the hype surrounding this movie has been a tad on the RESERVED side, if you ask me: considering what we have here- the overall scale of EVERYTHING-, the trailers should've been Longer and even Louder. The fx actually ENHANCE the drama, the way fx always should (but rarely do). If you're a fan of Giant Monster movies or Giant Robot movies or Giant Monsters vs. Giant Robots movies, you're in luck: PACIFIC RIM is now playing."

","I walked into this movie not caring much about the plot or the characters (which as expected where extremely campy and/or cliché), all I wanted out of this film are bad ass fight scenes with robots beating the crap out of godzillaesque monsters.<br/><br/>Did this film deliver, yes and no... <br/><br/>Both the mech and monster designs were done really well; the mechs look as they should, i.e. giant towering pieces of metal and the monsters look like stuff that came out of Godzilla movies. The down side to the designs is that essentially all the monsters have the color palette of either grey or darker grey and it doesn't help that all the fights occur at night or during a storm...or underneath the ocean...while the mechs have a bit more color to them, they are killed off way too quickly leaving only the two protagonist mechs which as you guessed it...just so happen to be colored grey...<br/><br/>The film does well to capture the sheer size of the monstrosities however, as a whole, combat was done poorly. The vast majority of action shots are either low angle, worm eye or close ups - sure it shows how brutal every punch or thrust is, however, at the same time - its hard to appreciate the fight choreography when a fist or horn takes up the majority of the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, for a popcorn flick, its average. 5/10."

","I went in expecting eye candy and that's what I got. The SFX were enough to pull you into this alternate reality. However; the actors were limited by the dialog and the dialog was limited by the story limitations. The two scientist were the wrong actors for those roles and pulls my score down. In fact all of the characters were either miss- cast or poor generalizations of stereo types; even the bad guy wasn't that good at being bad.<br/><br/>In any case, pick any a disaster flick, rename the characters and add some giant robots fighting Godzilla sized monsters. There ya go. Not much more too it. It's not on my top 100, but it's not in the bottom 100 either. When it shows up on Amazon Prime or Netflix, I'll watch it again to see what I missed the first time; but I won't be buying it a full price, or even half price."

As for the story, basically, the ocean floor has awoken creatures hiding for centuries. Blamed on our environmental failures, these creature have risen up and simply attack us to (of course), wipe us out.

","This could have been amazing, but there are too many plot holes and pointless detours for it to fulfill my (not very high) expectations.<br/><br/>Not only does del Toro show no real understanding of what it means to be ""Pacific"" (culturally, geographically, in terms of the space or urban landscapes), he manages to conflate pretty much all of Asia into one gigantic stereotype - and those Australian accents were so bad I almost walked out!<br/><br/>At the end of the day, there were a few passingly good action scenes, and a couple of almost- brilliant moments of apocalyptic doom, but the lack of believable (or interesting) characters (and the fact that 3 of the male leads looked almost identical), paired with the absence of any engaging settings (most of the battles are in the ocean), make this a fairly sub-par offering.<br/><br/>And did I mention that accents were really, really terrible? With the lackluster performances from Martini and Kazinsky (a Brit and an American), you could have hired pretty much any Australian guy off the street to do better. And why are Aussie characters so often mean and have bull-dogs? Being stupid and having bull mastiffs would make more sense - or being stoners with an old collie or a cattle dog. But vengeful and competitive, with a British bull- dog? Nothing good to say about those two characters, at all. Waste of time."

"chaos-rampant","Null","2","6","11 October 2013"," Acosmic bash
","This has a bit more personality and atmosphere than Bay's corporate burger joint next door, but in the kitchen it prepares basically the same greasy food. Taking a vague look, from afar, it repeats all the same clichés: hope is lost, regained, a rousing speech wires us for a last fight, scientists come up with a last-minute solution, then the noble sacrifice, the false death. <br/><br/>However, if you can ignore the smell coming from the kitchen, you may appreciate a few nice things on the walls. <br/><br/>There is a definitive style at work: colors, lights, movements. Some nice translucent environments. We also have a subjective eye in the fights, ordinary at this point but done well. Half the gamble here is to create visual comprehension: in order to visually grasp the fights we need to be placed, need something that creates human scale. It's why in the first fight there is the fishing boat, so that looking up from the deck we can acquire apparent size and distance. <br/><br/>The other half is gravity in the eye. We have it here, some breathtaking occasions. Del Toro employed people who really understand their physics, how things ought to move and impact so that we inherit the blow. My favorite bits are during the flight to space, inside the cockpit the camera moves up as the fall begins as if our eye has actual gravity. That someone thought this the appropriate motion and not just any wobbling I think matters. <br/><br/>So when all these things work in concert, in the best spots it achieves an operatic feel. <br/><br/>But we still have a gravity of perception geared to simple physics. This is where the poor story reappears in another light. We do indeed need human scale in more ways than one: a human relationship as our anchor so that looking up from it we'll grasp a scale of meaning that creates emotional metaphysics, projecting a sense of world round the physical moment. (great filmmakers, like Malick, can bring more of that inner sense in the visual flow) <br/><br/>Here they had a promising idea of this sort. In order to pilot the robots, two pilots are required in neural connection to each other, merging to one mind. They call the effect 'drifting', which is similar to terms I use to describe the same thing. The plot function is that a scientist 'drifts' with a monster brain, 'seeing' what they're planning to do which helps to save the day. Okay. <br/><br/>Deeper, the metaphor stands for love at its purest, for shared drifting between souls as the world is torn. Bringing to the drift no memory or self, not holding onto anything, flowing in the river and you are neither the river nor separate as the Chinese muse. Beautiful and apt metaphor. Someone here obviously knows about meditation, which is exactly this drifting in the present moment, skiing on mind. <br/><br/>Doesn't work when you also have to worry about giant toys. It's like wanting to understand quantum sense by looking at tectonic plates, different dynamics.<br/><br/>I think the broader mistake here was that they assumed we'd need to know as much as possible about the film's world otherwise we'd be lost. So we have a bunch of stuff thrown together in the prologue and then nothing is expanded, we just segue from one fight to the next. They didn't let us 'drift' with the narrative, discovering as we go. It has no world as a result. <br/><br/>(I think this is also why it didn't do well in the US, but did abroad. American audiences are being rewired to expect an ongoing world to inhabit for a few years, we all are but Americans are in the front of it —Nolan's Batman, the Marvel universe, Twilight, Potter and the recent crop of quality TV exemplify this in the most simple way. There may be nothing else noteworthy about this trend beyond setting up a viewing habit that I expect intelligent filmmakers to make much of. In Russia and China they are 20 years behind in cinematic terms, the sheer bulk of the thing still seems to work. Just a very rough guess.)"

","Those are the undeniable ingredients for a blockbuster. It's what most people like, and this movie got it all.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about this film before I started to watch it, just that there were giant robots in it. Since I watched Robot Jox back in the day (can't believe its score here is less than 5!!), I've always thought that somebody should make a mecha film, and never really understood why it wasn't happening. The beginning of this movie is just like that, it gave me an enormous feeling of being watching Robot Jox again: the acting, the dialogue, the music, the atmosphere... it all reminded me of it. Then, it started to remind me of other movies as well: Godzilla, Evangelion, and even HellBoy. This is particularly interesting: the mood of the movie, like some sort of comic book rather than a live action, reminded me incredibly of HellBoy. Then, I saw Santiago Segura (which gave me a funny surprise) and, after the appearance of Ron Perlman, I knew this movie had something to do with Guillermo Del Toro. I swear I didn't have a clue who the director was, but these points were unmistakable. The end credits confirmed my suspicion. Now, this says a lot about Del Toro, since he can give his particular touch to anything, apparently. However, it also says how predictable and clichéd his movies are. Because, unfortunately, the points that made me think of this director even before I knew it was him behind the camera, are the same points that make me think of this movie as a worthless piece of cinematography. The same jokes, the adolescence feeling... It's a pity that Del Toro has to be linked to these characteristics, rather than other details that shined with originality in some of their other movies like Pan's Labyrinth or The Devil's Backbone. Oh, speaking of predictability, after 33 min into the movie, you will know how it will be ending. Seriously. After 1 hour, you may even be able to predict what will happen in the next scene.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is the shallowest of movies. The whole point of it being simply using all and any instruments at the director's disposition to aid the showing off of hits, punches and so-called cool dialogue lines (nothing more than rancid clichés). The plot itself has sooooo many holes in it, each one of them the size of one of those giant robots. It's pointless to discuss them. This movie doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's a flick to be enjoyed by people who has the capacity of leaving their minds blank (or who actually HAVE minds like that). For Pete's sake, we even get a harangue! <br/><br/>Pacific Rim made me feel the same as HellBoy 2 did: it seems a potpourri of this and that movie, these and those animated series, of rancid clichés and surrender-it-all to a grandiose FX's show of explosions and destruction. Is Del Toro becoming a new Michael Bay? I really hope not.<br/><br/>Alas, once again, IMDb's rating will be deceiving for an audience who expects more than absurd plots and puberty's amusements. I would have enjoyed this 20 years ago, maybe. Like I did enjoy Robot Jox then. Now, I can only see another piece for the children at heart (and mind)."
"brillmongo","4","2","6","2 October 2013"," Overall a pleasant experience, but deeply flawed.
","Giant robots engaging in fisticuffs with giant monsters is a joy to behold that I doubt will ever grow old, but the other elements in Pacific Rim are greatly lacking.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the basic premise is pants on head retarded, I just wish basic things such as characterisation was handled more effectively. It doesn't help either when Pacific Rim contradicts itself by one moment speaking of the need for efficiency over showing off and in the next scene (literally) pulling its punches.<br/><br/>Bad writing is an forever will be bad writing, and Pacific Rim is rife with it.

","This is an absolutely magnificent movie! I have seen hundreds of films and this movie is only the 6th that I have awarded a 10/10 to. All this year, I had been anticipating the release of Snyder's Man of Steel, with Pacific Rim coming in at a distant 2nd for my ""Most Anticipated of 2013"" list. Not only was this movie better than Man of Steel, but I am now prepared to say it is one of my favourite movies of all time! Not being impressed by Del Toro's Hellboy, I was a bit anxious when he was directing a movie about giant robots fighting aliens, but my fears were aside with an impressive first trailer. Ever since its release, I have always considered Transformers: Dark of the Moon to contain the best action in any movie (say what you will about Michael Bay), but that has now been figuratively shat on by Del Toro proving that there is a healthy middle- ground between heart-pumping ""mindless"" action and the making of a great movie. Giant robots fighting enormous aliens - it's not just for meth-heads anymore... Incredible film!"
"joshy3000","6","2","6","2 September 2013"," Best Del Toro movie? Probably
","This is one of those movies where the trailer did not do any justice, lets face it, the first thing you thought of when the trailer played was ""Transformers vs. Godzilla with a storyline as appealing as battle L.A""<br/><br/>Good: Del Toro did a great job on making the robots and monsters in this movie feel enormous, every second they are on screen it feels like building tall warriors are throwing down. The action in this movie is mindblowing; it's not like Transformers where explosions and throw downs are right infront of you face with a mixture of smoke and shaky cam and you don't even know if a good guy or a bad guy just blew up(but comparing this movie to transformers is like comparing the twilight saga to blade because there are vampires in it). But the action feels enormous, the mechs move all slow and they punch slowly because they're gigantic. The plot in this movie is surprisingly good. It's in depth, it explains everything without spoon-feeding the viewer. The acting in this movie was also surprisingly good every actor looked like they had fun in this movie. The Bad: the reason I said the acting was surprisingly good was because if George Lucas has taught us anything it's that cheesy dialog and too much time in a green room can lead to bad acting. Don't get me mistaken, the dialog in this movie is no where near as cheesy as the Shakespearean crap Lucas shoved down our throats in the Star Wars Prequels, but there were still some lines where I just thought ""ok that sounded pretty dumb"". Dialog aside you just don't care about the characters problems, Del Toro tried to relate the two main characters by giving them a broken past and making them have reasons to want to smash Godzilla's face in. Now I don't mind character development one bit, but I just did not care the least bit for the characters problems. There were also quite a few useless characters. There were three characters that of the movie didn't have it would have been no different. All in all this movie is a great time, with good acting, a compelling storyline, some cheesy dialog and pointless characters, and mindblowing action. You won't regret seeing this 'movie it's pretty awesome."
"neoandersson2","4","2","6","22 August 2013"," Amazing CGI, but that's about it.
","So, I came into the theater with a positive attitude despite my friends having already judged the movie based on the trailer. It had been given some great reviews, so I figured it can't be all that bad. Now I realize I was sorely mistaken, I swear to god they must have spent half of that 200.000.000 budget on bribing people to give them good reviews. <br/><br/>I haven't received my paycheck, so I'm going to be honest instead. <br/><br/>So let's just summarize what I think about this movie. It's ridiculous. The CGI is ridiculously good. The acting and the script is ridiculously bad.<br/><br/>I knew exactly what kind of movie this was from the beginning, I mean, who didn't. It was blockbuster movie, a CGI-feast. I just expected it to hold a higher class. <br/><br/>In a CGI blockbuster movie of this magnitude I expect at least some witty humor along with the giant robots whipping alien ass. ( Think The Avengers ).<br/><br/>But there was none. The characters was just awful... I can't even begin to imagine the kind of drugs the writers took when they thought it was a good idea to turn the whole movie into high-school drama movie for 45 minutes. It's so exhausting to watch it, there's even the bully with the leather jacket that for absolute no reason doesn't like the main character, there's the high-school crush thing going on... it's exhausting just thinking about it. The only thing I could think about during the middle piece of the movie was ""When the hell are they going to blow stuff up with their robots?"" I was cringing so hard that my face hurt.<br/><br/>But the movie has it upsides, the CGI is ridiculously good. You truly get engaged in those fight scenes. Every punch delivered by those massive machines makes you just stand up and shout ""**** YEAH!!!"". The music was also fitting. <br/><br/>Therefore, 4 out of 10 stars seemed the appropriate rating."
"Reverie5","3","2","6","20 August 2013"," I blame myself...
","I blame myself for being sucked in by the good ratings/reviews. I always refer to IMDb to make sure a movie has a rating of at least 7 before watching. This is the first time IMDb has failed me and I cannot believe it. Am I finally growing up or has the majority become content with dumb movies? Great intro, got me interested. Huge robots fighting ginormous monstrous aliens. What could go wrong? Nothing, unless you enjoy a more exciting and intriguing story line. Huge tragedy for main character Raleigh Becket, cool... Already goes downhill from there. After the first fight, I asked myself, ""Can they really not find any better way to counter the monsters than punching it with oversized fists?"" Surely humanity isn't that retarded... but it is. Another fight included using a ship as a baseball bat, and crates as boxing gloves. 3/4 of the movie later, they used swords as a last resort that they had hidden away from the very beginning, and turned out to be the most effective weapon. As for character development, how did Raleigh Becket get Mako Mori to swoon over him? By simply existing? They barely exchanged any words and the broad be peeping through her door to stare at him like a little fan girl. Thanks for portraying an Asian woman in the military in such a pitiful way. The last Jaeger pilots that are supposed to be the best of the best included two American teams, one Russian duo, and one Asian trio. What a surprise it was when both the Russians and Asians went down with ease. I'm all for America, but seriously pointing out how great they are and then killing them off within seconds is pathetic. The high rating would be fine if Pacific Rim was an action/comedy... I give it a 3 purely for the awesome visuals. This is a film for my dad, the action junkie."
"nicolas-feld","9","2","6","18 August 2013"," The best at what it does
","Like so many others, I was drawn to this movie by Guillermo del Toro alone, or rather, the unexpected combination of del Toro and the mecha-kaiju genre. I even took my wife along, figuring there wouldn't be a lot of gore but a lot of mind-blowing action sequences instead. Damn, we weren't disappointed!<br/><br/>This movie is like no other. If you've appreciated The Host, Cloverfield, Godzilla, and the like, you will love Pacific Rim. But even if you're just looking for powerful mecha action sequences, this movie does it far better than any Transformer movie or even animes like Evangelion. And finally, and that's really del Toro's touch, even if you're not a fan of the mecha-kaiju genre at all, which my wife isn't, you'll find a lot to love in this movie.<br/><br/>The directing is great as always, the depth of every character is just enough to make them truly likable, on top of that the actors are surprisingly good, particularly Rinko Kikuchi and the little girl - which we see only too little - which portrays her younger self, some scenes - like the one with the younger Mako as a matter of fact - are to be remembered as classics, the SFX are beautiful, state of the art, and don't spoil the almost artistic quality of certain scenes by trying to push too far, and the scenario is extremely smart and mostly coherent from beginning to end.<br/><br/>There are a few inconsistencies in the script and a few clichés that weren't really necessary - especially considering how many many other clichés Pacific Rim brilliantly avoids or twists - for which I remove one star, but just one. Because other than that, this movie is so close to perfection. The best piece of kaiju action ever to hit the screen. And one of the best action movies of the decade."
"ronaldo-rivera03","9","2","6","17 August 2013"," Absolute work of art
","Saw this recently and I'm now wondering to myself why I was hesitant to see it when it first came out. In my opinion this blows the Transformers franchise out of the water (slight pun not intended). The story, though a little fast-paced is well laid out but understandable given Del Toro really only had two hours to play with and plenty of characters to develop. I do think the jumps in timeline were used well and helped keep the story intact. The effects was one of the best I've ever seen in a movie, and the impact of the destruction and fight scenes were very believable. For example, when the Jaegers crash on hard surface the thud of heavy steel sounds so accurate but I can't say the same for the scenes in Transformers. My favorite characters would have to be those played by Idris Elba and Charlie Day. Their respective characters brought perfect balance to serious and humorous tones in the film. I did think the final battle scenes were a bit of an anticlimax, I was expecting more damage from a category 5 Kaiju but then again I understand they needed to keep the action close to the destination point. I really wouldn't have mind at all if this film went on for three hours, it was that engaging. Fantastic acting from most of the actors (the supposed Aussie characters wasn't too passable but they will do), fantastic action and just the right amount of humor really makes it hard to not recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great sci-fi."

"rparham","7","2","6","28 July 2013"," What summer blockbusters should be more like
","Pacific Rim is a film that doesn't try to hide what it is. An updating of Japanese giant monster movies that first were all the rage in the 1950s, Pacific Rim tells a similar story with the benefit of much higher-end visual effects than was possible on the lower budgeted events of eras past. However, Pacific Rim, unlike many Hollywood summer blockbusters, doesn't really skimp on other elements that make for a good film, with attention to character and story along the way. No one will mistake Pacific Rim as a masterpiece, but no one ever said being a blockbuster meant you had to be a bad film.<br/><br/>Set in the near future, the Earth has been under constant attack by giant monsters, named Kaiju, that are emerging from a dimensional rift on the floor of the Pacific ocean. To combat the Kaiju, the governments of the world have built the Jaegers, giant, multi-story robots, controlled by two pilots who have melded their minds to prevent the mental strain of manning the Jaegers from turning their brains to mush. One Jaeger pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) gave up the program years earlier when his brother, who was his Jaeger co-pilot, had been killed in a confrontation with a Kaiju. However, since then, the Kaiju have become more dangerous, and the various world leaders have decided to put all their energy into building a giant wall to surround the coastlines of the Pacific from the Kaiju. Marshall Pentecost (Idris Elba) does not believe that will prevent the Kaiju from destroying the planet, so he and the four remaining Jaegers are assembled at Hong Kong to lead a final charge against the Kaiju to stop them once and for all. To man one of the Jaegers, Pentecost has brought Raleigh back into the fold, teaming him up with Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) to help lead the battle, but Raleigh's troubled past, and emotional scars of Mako's own, make the success of the mission seem dubious.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim's screenplay written by Travis Beacham and the film's director, Guillermo del Toro, assembles elements that have been well worn in countless other movies. The earth under attack from menacing alien forces, the reluctant hero, the final desperate charge of a rag tag band of survivors, there isn't hardly any aspect that hasn't been lifted from somewhere else. So, while Pacific Rim won't get an A for originality, del Toro and Beacham do an impressive job of assembling the pieces into an entertaining, engaging whole. One key thing del Toro does right is to not transform Pacific Rim into an action orgy, like the recent Transformers films. While you can't accuse Pacific Rim of being without action, the film isn't a constant slog through an endless cycle of action sequences. There is attention given to setting up the plot, and also to establishing the characters and their relationships to one another. Pacific Rim's strongest example of this is the development of Raleigh and Mako's partnership, with more than a hint of romance lurking beneath. The two actors have a distinct chemistry, and that comes across in their scenes together. Like most good movies, Pacific Rim knows that without strong characters, everything else is just a lot of empty sound and images.<br/><br/>When the film does provide its action sequences, Pacific Rim largely delivers. It's prime set piece is a large scene about half-way through set in Hong Kong and the surrounding bay. The action is exciting, well staged, and full of energy. del Toro crafts this sequence to maximum effect, getting the adrenaline pumping. Filmmakers that want to see how to stage large scale action should look no further than this major scene. Pacific Rim isn't exactly perfect, though. Two scientist characters, portrayed by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, are intended to be comic relief, but their performances are so shrill and over the top, they quickly become annoying and off putting. del Toro also gives a small role to one of his regulars, Ron Perlman, as a Kaiju organ black marketeer, and while I always enjoy seeing Perlman pop up in anything, here he is largely filer, his character producing a smile at first, but, in the long run, not a very interesting role. Pacific Rim's ending is a bit underwhelming also, as the obvious parallels to other films robs the end of some of its energy. It doesn't ruin the movie, but a fresher conclusion would have been beneficial.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is the blockbuster Summer popcorn film that you generally wish more summer blockbusters would emulate rather than brain dead junk such as Transformers. By working in some nice character material, and allowing the film to breathe between action sequences, Pacific Rim manages to deliver a generally entertaining two hours at the movies. Its not groundbreaking or particularly deep, but for what it is, it delivers the goods."
"Hellmant","Null","2","6","13 July 2013"," The movie is corny for sure but it's an awesome kids movie; fanboys should be more than pleased!
","'PACIFIC RIM': FIVE STARS (OUT OF FIVE)<br/><br/>Director Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi action film about a future where the world is taken over by giant sea creatures and humanity's last hope is to build giant robots to fight them. The robots are controlled by two pilots who must merge their minds together through a neural link in order to control them. Del Toro uses this theme as a metaphor for how we all must come together in life (accepting each other's flaws and differences and utilizing each other's strengths and empathy) in order to survive and live in peace and happiness. The movie is corny for sure but it's an awesome kids movie with a lot of heart and fanboys should be more than pleased. <br/><br/>The story is set in the near future when a portal is opened, in a crevasse beneath the Pacific Ocean, which leads to another dimension. It unleashes giant monsters into our world, called 'Kaiju', which quickly wipe out millions of lives and destroy much of our resources. All the countries of the world unite together to fight the monsters and develop a technology they call 'Jaegers', which are giant humanoid robots controlled by two pilots. The pilots must link to the robots, through a neural bridge, in order to control them. This proved to be too much for a single pilot so two pilots are required to control the robots and must neurally link together, through a process called 'Drifting', in order to do so. 'Drifting' allows the pilots to see into each others minds, and learn the other's deepest and darkest fears, in order to better cooperate and control the giant machinery. <br/><br/>The film focuses on one pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who loses his brother (Diego Klattenhoff) while 'drifting' (during a 'Jaeger' battle with an extremely powerful 'Kaiju'). The trauma of the event forces him to retire and the world continues to decay as the 'Jaegers' become less and less effective in battling the 'Kaiju'. The worlds governments eventually give up on the 'Jaeger' program and terminate it. The 'Jaeger' program's commanding officer, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), isn't ready to quit just yet. He comes up with a plan to end the war with the monsters once and for all but he needs Becket to help him carry it out. Becket reluctantly agrees and teams up with a test pilot, named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), to pilot his old 'Jaeger' (which is named 'Gipsy Danger' and one of only four remaining 'Jaegers'). Mako is very close to Pentecost and has a tragic past involving the 'Kaiju', which causes complications when 'drifting' with Becket. The two must overcome these problems and work together as the 'Kaiju' become an increasingly greater threat. A geek scientist, named Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day, of 'IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA' fame) also becomes intricate in Becket's plan to stop the apocalypse.<br/><br/>Del Toro directed and co-wrote the film (with Travis Beacham, who conceived the story idea). Together they really have created an amazing world. I love all the detail and passion that went into creating it and think it really paid off well. Their $180 million budget really went to good use as the film looks spectacular. It's like a beautiful live action cartoon and you really can't go wrong with giant robots vs. monsters (the action scenes are unreal)! It's everything I loved about the movies when I was a kid (this movie would have blown me away). The acting is great (Elba is always too cool, Kikuchi gives a passionate and very strong performance and I could watch Day for hours in a role like this) but the star of this movie really is Guillermo del Toro. He's really outdone himself here. I love movies but I especially like the nostalgic ones that really bring out the kid in me. This is one of those movies and I can't give it high enough praise.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P84p-Ba6JbY"

","I had many reasons to watch it, one, I was a huge fan of 'Godzilla' movie, saw it when I was a kid and being speechless for many days. Two, Guillermo Del Toro. Three, I always eager to watch a good visual effect movie on big screen, so I am graphic geek.<br/><br/>The story follows when giant monsters known as Kaiju rises from beneath the Pacific ocean, the war between human and them commences. Initially millions of humans lose their lives in the series of Kaiju attacks. To fight those monsters humans creates monsters like giant robots called Jaegers. This makes the war between them fair enough to compete each others and balanced until the monsters started to gain the fighting power back from the humans. So the years pass the apocalypse nears, the humans need to stand and fight one final time to defend the Earth and what happen next were the grand finale.<br/><br/>I feel deja vu now, wait, I have seen before these giant robots somewhere before. It took more than a moment to figure it out. In my childhood I saw them in the television cartoon show, Duckstales but I don't know what they are called. Those were kinda similar to these giants.<br/><br/>When 'Transformers' and 'Godzilla' comes together it forms 'Pacific Rim'. A $220 million movie which made lots of buzz on movie goers, including me. Wondered what was he (Guillermo Del Toro) planing all this year since 'The Golden Army' which released a half decade ago. The more gap between the movies, the expectation grows higher and I was just curious to see this movie than thinking how it could be. Even I had set countdown in my phone for this day (12-07-2013) since last 60 days. Finally the day came, as a movie freak I wanted to see it in IMAX, since there is no IMAX around me I had no choice but go for regular silver screen digital 3D version.<br/><br/>Does it worth seeing in digital 3D? is the million dollar question from the people who are looking forward to see this movie. I say definitely worth it, what is the use to see an advanced technique and a CGI graphic movie in the regular version. Movies like these are meant to see in digital 3D because it is not some comedy or sentimental drama but a huge action pact movie. Don't expect pop-ups, that's for amateurs who are new to experience the 3D illusions. It was shot in regular 2D then converted to digital 3D so it was better but not so awesome.<br/><br/>The movie had not serious big names in the cast. There is no one particularly to say who done great work but they all performed their best. The Japanese girl Rinko Kikuchi was kinda cute, as the movie was inspired from Japanese monster tales she added the Japanese flavour to the movie. Ron Perlman was good, expected little more screen space for him. Charlie Hunnman and Idris Elba, they both were okay especially Charlie Day has been so nice just like he was in 'Horrible Bosses'. Looks like he's a new sensation in comedy World, hope a great future ahead of him.<br/><br/>Geographically speaking I am happy that this whole movie won't take place in the United States itself after all it was theirs movie. Hollywood has a Worldwide fan base so when they make movie from outside the regular geographical stream the audience from the rest of the World will always welcome it.<br/><br/>It was not the best movie nor the worst that I have seen in this monsoon. For a $220 million movie the graphics were so awesome, the action and stunts were breathtaking but by far the story was so weak especially the character developments. Whenever you see Kaiju and Jaeger on the screen it will be the thrilling experiences but other than that the development happening around the human characters were little boring I mean it was emotionless. When it compared to 'Godzilla', 'Godzilla' was well balanced between them two while in 'Pacific Rim' it was one sided and that is all about graphic, actions and 3D. These modern movie techniques carried the whole movie with their shoulder and made to look better. I can say these special effects were the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>Like my synopsis say it was decent till the end then confuses with few common logic. If you just ignore it, the movie will give you the best entertainment that you have paid for. If you are looking for a good story, twist and characters then it is not the right choice, this movie was totally an action packed with awesome graphics. This movie will more suitable for younger audiences."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","6","12 July 2013"," Guillermo del Toro takes Michael Bay to school on the subject of giant robots.
","With his new science fiction thriller ""Pacific Rim,"" director Guillermo del Toro effectively takes Michael Bay to school on how to make a movie about giant robots. Unlike Bay's torpid transforming nonsense, del Toro's film is thoughtful and smart. It may not be perfect, but it's got way more style, way more substance and way cooler robots. It's also got Ron Perlman as a black marketeer who runs an underground cartel dealing in alien body parts. Let's see Shia LaBeouf do that.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro loves movie monsters, there's no doubt about it. If you've seen ""Pan's Labyrinth"" or ""Mimic"" or ""Hellboy"" then you know that he's not a director who just throws CGI around for its own sake. His movies are crafted with loving care. His characters have more dimension then we might expect and his stories actually have meaning. This is a guy who clearly loves movies.<br/><br/>His latest is an ode to the monster movies he loved as a child growing up in Mexico. ""Pacific Rim"" takes place the future, when the Earth is being besieged by monsters, called ""Kaiju,"" that have arrived in our world via a space portal beneath the Pacific Ocean. Following in the tradition of Godzillla and Mothra, these Kaiju have destroyed our cities, killed millions of people and depleted our resources. In response, the military has put together a strike force consisting of 50 foot robots called ""Jaegers"" which must be controlled by two pilots at the same time (right brain and left brain). The pilots are connected mentally through a neural bridge in a process called ""The Drift"", effectively allowing them to share the same memories and mental stability so they can work together. The two pilots share minds with each other and effectively are bonded for life.<br/><br/>Our hero is Raleigh Becket (Chris Hunnum) a nice-looking loner who never-the-less nurses a wounded heart. Years ago, he was at the controls of one of these robots when his brother was killed while still connected to him. True to the form of half the movies ever made, the wounded hero is reluctantly pulled back into service despite claims by the program's commanding officer Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) that he is a loose cannon who doesn't follow orders. He also needs a new partner, and Pentecost reluctantly issues him another damaged soul named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) a Japanese pilot who bears the scars of having had her family wiped out by the Kaiju back in Japan when she was a child.<br/><br/>Per his usual, del Toro allows these characters to have an extra dimension, but not so much that they get in the way of the smash and bash. They are connected to one another on an emotional level (the technology of the Jaegers demands it) just enough that we feel that there are people here and not just pawns to move around the plot. One of the great joys of the movie is that a lot of time is devoted to the humans discovering things about the Kaiju and how to defeat them.<br/><br/>The characters are given an extra dimension, but only enough that they don't feel like throw-aways. The best performance in the movie (even under the constraints of pat dialogue) comes from Rinko Kikuchi as Mako. She's a talented actor who got a lot of attention – and an Oscar nomination – six years ago for her performance as Chieko in ""Babel"", as a deaf Japanese schoolgirl who filtered her grief over her mother's suicide into sexual rebellion. Kikuchi hasn't made a major American film since then, but she is still a talent waiting to be discovered by audiences. She has an open, expressive face, especially in the reaction shots: When she's not talking, she's listening, not just waiting for the other actor to finish so she can talk. She has a fine and delicate screen presence that suggests strengths waiting to surface.<br/><br/>Another great performance comes from Charlie Day as a nervous scientist who is bright enough to use the neural bridge to mentally connect with one of the monsters to figure out their plan. With his hyperactive manner and high-pitched voice, Day is perfect for a movie like this. He plays Newton Geizler, a scientist who suddenly finds that he needs a severed alien brain and that puts him in contact with the oddly named Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman), a greasy black marketeer who has made his bones selling Kaiju body parts of every description. It has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>One the human level, the movie works. It outclasses most science fiction hot air in which the technology overwhelms anything else. Where it comes up short is on the action itself. Yes, the special effects are impressive, and the robots here have more character than the ungainly Transformers. But, del Toro's special effects team makes the unwise decision to shoot every monster vs. robot battle at night and in close-up – usually while it's raining. These scenes, shot at a distance in broad daylight might have given us a little more visual orientation. We know what's at stake for the characters but we'd like a little more involvement. Still, del Toro has fashioned together a movie that is worth your time. Let's put it this way, if a Monsters vs. Robots movie has to be made, this is probably as good as it gets.<br/><br/>***1/2 (of four)"

","This is my first time to watch Guillermo del Torro's directions experience on high-digital movies. Watching Pacific Rim is like watching Japanese's robotic movies, despite of its technical performances. The origin story is quite original, coming from ideas of monsters coming under our world, human world and the emergence of a hero, very big hero, to destroy them. On the view of technical performances, nothing but big, huge, and robotics. I can't imagine how genius is Guillermo del Torro to manage his art team. But that's great job! Viewers can feel the feel of being a monster itself, being a big creature. That's why I can't recommend this film on DVD. My last review touches the story and actors. The story is smooth-shocking viewers, but the ending is romantic, as always :) On this movie, we find some new coming actors, but within them, there are several action actors, so we can also watch some actions as defined on our imagination. Thank you Guillermo del Torro!"

Normally movies fail to deliver on special affects due to budgets, or just poor vision in general which is why many (like myself) turn to anime which can easily make these actions sequences come to life in cartoon form, but this movie bridged that gap easily. <br/><br/>If you've watched Godzilla movies and always felt it was missing something in terms of actions or affects then you need not look any further as this movie is the answer. <br/><br/>I so look so forward to the sequel!!"

","I will never truly understand why so many people enjoy and defend this movie. The common line is that the movie is about robots fighting giant monsters, so what did you expect? And while I guess that is true, there are so many other movies that this can be applied to that we generally agree are awful (Transformers). This movie has just as bad writing, just as flat characters, and just as cliché a plot as that series, and yet I'm supposed to forgive all that because the fight scenes are well made? <br/><br/>The problem with the ""What did you expect?"" argument is that sci-fi action doesn't have to be inherently stupid. ""The Terminator"" is just about a time traveling robot assassin, and yet it's held up by interesting characters and actual good writing. ""RoboCop"" is just about a cop who is turned into a cyborg, and yet the movie has satire and violently dark comedy. We shouldn't excuse an awful script full of rampant clichés and forced romance just because we like the fight scenes. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, I am giving it 3 stars because Guillermo obviously knows what he is doing in the special effects department and the overall look of the film is great. The problem with the fight scenes is that all of the characters are so flat and boring and unmemorable that I couldn't care less about the outcome. The tense chase scenes in the aforementioned Terminator work because we like the characters involved and we know the consequences of their failure. Sure, there are consequences in this movie, but so much infrastructure is destroyed that a bit more just seems irrelevant.<br/><br/>If you want to watch the fight scenes, just find them on YouTube, don't waste 2+ hours on this movie."

So, here we have a talented director with big budget, big effects, big action and b-movie cast. Yup, you heard it. This is the main flaw of this movie, aside from the fact that we have usual stereotypes seen in action movies such as ""Armaggeddon"" or ""Independence Day"". You can throw this movie to the same bag with aforementioned titles. I'm actually surprised that Michael Bay didn't make this movie, it would fit him well. Charlie Hunnam, Robert Kazinsky and Idris Elba? C'mon man! I like Idris but he plays horribly in his role. Where is Christian Bale, Matt Damon or Tom Cruise when you need them?

And the funny twists were not funny at all, a toilet being at the right place and a monster comes to live once more to...OK no spoilers. The characters were thin and sometimes even ridiculous.

I had an inkling he wanted to make this movie after the giant plant creature in HELLBOY 2; well, now he has.<br/><br/>And this is a lot of fun, a decent popcorn flick for a change and a film that's well made enough to erase memories of the disappointing TRANSFORMERS movies. It's a great Hollywood tribute to Japanese cinema, filled with all of the wonderful effects and super-sized action that you'd hope for. Del Toro is one of those directors who hasn't made a bad film yet; you can always rely on him for entertainment.<br/><br/>Sure, the stuff with the human characters isn't as interesting as the giant stuff. But at least we get plenty of British actors in the cast (Burn Gorman, Idris Elba, Rob Kazinsky, Charlie Hunnam) which keeps it fresh and interesting. The CGI effects are excellent, as you'd expect, and while the storyline is very predictable, that's not the point. The point is to deliver huge bouts of destructive action, and that's what del Toro does. And it's a lot of fun."

And it felt like i've seen the movie 100000 times before with all the clichés. The cliché characters, the typical ending with hand clapping (ofc what else in US movies) the speech, the sacrifice, the ""oh is he dead........ no he wakes up and makes a ""comedian"" comment"", the savage blood thirsty aliens with no brains or motive. The actor that played Marshal did an OK job though, but it didn't help much with a total piece of crap movie like this. But I guess that's what the stupid masses want to see these days.

","I'm always somewhat like a kid on Christmas eve when it comes to Guillermo del Toros movies. I don't expect the world or an eye-opening life-changing experience, but I do expect to be entertained. He has a combination of visual flair, and understanding of how you build an effective action scene (and in extension action movie) which makes a potent cocktail.<br/><br/>The plot is pure nonsense, and is rushed by mostly through voice-over right from the start. Seemingly just to get it out of the way. ""Bla bla, giant monsters attack and we build robots to meet them in a boxing-match."" Honestly, most of the plot is not explained much further in the film than in the trailer. Acting ranges between bland and pretty lame, some of the actors are competent performers, but it's not like they are especially challenged in this movie.<br/><br/>So, with that out of the way, let's talk essentials. I'm not a fan of the monsters, they look clumsy and lack elegance. Generally though, this movie is beautiful. del Toro knows how to get the adrenaline flowing with visuals and a suitably high-octane soundtrack. Everyone talks tough, walks tough and acts tough. It doesn't always work, and parts of the story feel tacked-on and just an interruption to the action. But mostly though, the movie delivers when it comes to action and excitement.<br/><br/>I view this as a guilty pleasure. Something that should appeal mostly to 13-year-olds, and not men three times their age. But still, even though I can't say that I feel like seeing it again, it entertained me for most of the duration."

","The good thing about this film was that the CGI sequences (which probably account for 80% of the movie) are convincing and engaging. I enjoyed that part. The script was laboured and in places excruciatingly hackneyed. It made me wince on several occasions; I felt that Idris Elba deserved better. The clichés are somewhat thick on the ground especially with the final ""is-he-isn't-he-dead"" sequence with such a predictable result. One thing which rankled through this production was the scene where one of the monsters was blown to pieces by chest mounted cannon fire from a Jaeger, this being no more or less than you would expect from an advanced missile system mounted in a jet, helicopter or a ground station. If this was an effective weapon, why deploy the Jaegers. Too many holes in the plot and dialogue to give this higher that a 5, but entertaining if you switch off all artistic and other critical judgment. Kids will love it though!"

Nothing like reliving that excitement of seeing Mech duke it out with some giant Monster.<br/><br/>Plot: Kaijus are creatures from a different dimension that gain access to our world through a rift at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. (Pacific Rim, get it) that is how straight forward the story is. Mankind to defend themselves create Jaegers (Mech Suits or giant robots, your choice). Like every movie it is not without sins, but the ride is so full of battles and action that made it completely enjoyable for me. Acting is boring and cookie cutter, but what do you expect. Don't tell me you endured Dragonball Z for the acting and dialog. No, you did because the Universe presented was exciting and full of creatures that kept raising the level of difficulty for the heroes. The same applies in this movie.

"rtp4242","7","1","2","11 May 2014"," Pacific Rim. Brimming with fun.
","For 10 years, the earth has been under attack by Kaiju, dinosaur like creatures that lived under the plates in the Pacific Rim, and came to the surface through what's called the beach, a portal between our two worlds. Mankind put their differences past them, and built jaegars, huge robots to fight the kaiju. The world got really good at fighting the kaiju, until the monsters evolved and started destroying the jaegars. Two of the best jaegar piliots are Yancy Becket (Diego Klattenhoff) and his brother, Raleigh. (Charlie Hunnam) One day, during another wave of kaiju attacks, Yancy is killed, the public is starting to lose faith in the jaegars, and the latest idea is to build a wall to stop the kaiju, decommission the jaegers, send them to Hong Kong and send the commander of the jaegar program, Stacker Pentecost, (Idris Elba) into early retirement.<br/><br/>But Pentecost has other ideas, it is months before they can finish the wall, and the kaiju seem to be penetrating the wall like a hot knife through butter, so Pentecost relies on what he knows best, the jaegar program. He wants Raleigh to control the jaegar, but Raleigh needs a co-pilot because the drift or melding of minds is too much for one brain. The best candidate is Mako Mori (Rinko Kakuchi) a girl Pentecost saved from a kaiju attack years before. Mako is traumatized by the attack she witnessed as a child, but can she bury those memories long enough to work with Raleigh? Will Pentecost stop being protective about Mako long enough to let her pilot the jaegar with Raleigh? Will Pentecost's plan work?<br/><br/>I like Pacific Rim. I know, I know it's a cross between Godzilla and the Transformers, but there are lots of influences that shape this movie, it's part Godzilla, part Transformers, but I also see elements of movies like Avatar, Independence Day, the Matrix, and yes even Star Wars in this movie. So what makes this movie better than just a cheap rip off of other sci fi movies? It's the characters. Mako has to fight Raleigh in a martial arts duel before she can co-pilot the jaegar, Pentecost has fatherly feelings for Mako, there's a rivalry between two scientists, one who specializes in predicting the attacks, and the other who wants to learn about the keiju biology. There's also a smarmy guy who deals in selling parts of the dead keiju for profit. These are fun characters, and I enjoyed seeing them interact. If there is a drawback to the story it is that the movie is too long and indulges in too many special effects. It's also easy as a Star Trek episode to tell who the extras are, but that's a minor quibble.<br/><br/>The acting makes this movie even better. Charlie Hunnam is good as the action hero Raleigh, brave yet sensitive because of the death of his brother. Rinko Kakuchi is also good as Mako, part sidekick, part love interest, though thankfully, the writers don't delve too deeply into the love interest portion of their characters but it's definitely hinted at. Idris Elba is good as part action hero being put out to pasture part father figure. Elba injects this character with a 'my way or the highway' attitude that definitely adds some dimension to the character. But it is Charlie Day and Ron Perlman who absolutely steal this movie and make it a pleasure to watch. Day revels in playing the fast- talking, combative biologist whose scientific curiosity is only superseded by his survival instinct. Ron Perlman happily wades into the swamp to find his character, complete with gold shoes that make him look like the neighborhood pimp.<br/><br/>This is not writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's best film, that would be Pan's Labyrinth, but it may be his most entertaining film. I only wish he had cut the length and the special effects. Other than that, it's a damn good summer popcorn action flick."

The acting is solid throughout with the pairing in the Jaeger (mech) both delivering good performances but in acting idriss Elba once again stole the show, there is a speech he delivers in this film and oh my goodness it felt like I would happily fight for him. This is emphatic with the point that this is different to a film like transformers where the human parts of the film are boring whereas in pacific rim the human parts are fantastic. But pacific rim's biggest strength by far is the action between monster and mech this may be the greatest action on a large scale ever with all the action feeling heavy and realistic for what a situation would really be like. There's a couple of scientist characters that I didn't really like in this film and also you could argue they could have split the action and talking up a little more but these are my only minor gripes as I absolutely love this film and it is now the standard bearer for these types of films."

If you're going in expecting to experience a story rooted in science and logic; you'll also be disappointed.<br/><br/>This is not that movie.<br/><br/>The best way I've found to describe this movie is a live action anime flick from the 1980s; think Battle of the Planets meets Power Rangers.<br/><br/>There is no logical reason for giant robots with plasma cannons and missile launchers to jeopardize themselves and the world by insisting on fighting the monsters hand-to-hand; only resorting to weaponry when their defeat seems imminent. The reason they fight hand-to-hand is because it's just so much cooler on-screen than watching a weapon platform launch projectiles from a safe distance.<br/><br/>There is also no logical reason why the worlds' governments would waste all their resources building giant walking robots when those exact same plasma and missile weapons could easily be mounted on ships and tanks instead. Again, the only reason to do so is because it looks cool to have them mounted on giant, anthropomorphic robots. And no-one can argue that the fights in this movie aren't extremely cool to watch.<br/><br/>If you're the type of viewer who can check their brain at the door and accept a few gaps in logic in favour of awesome visuals, then I can't recommend this movie enough. The action is intense and continuous, the sound design and soundtrack are amazing, and the visual effects are incredibly effective. If you can afford the additional cost of a 3D blu-ray player and the appropriate disc, you have the ingredients to a fun movie night. Just be sure to watch it with like-minded individuals."
"motezart","9","1","2","4 February 2014"," Most Surprisingly Good Film of 2013
","2013's most surprisingly awesome film was Pacific Rim. How did I miss this? Well<br/><br/>Even though it was directed by Guillermo del Toro, who has to date made only excellent films, the trailers and the marketing for Pacific Rim did not do the film justice. There was only a bare- bones connection linking del Toro's star power to this film. For the average person who may know del Toro's other films, Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 1 & 2, but not his name, the little ""directed by"" box at the bottom of the promotional poster would not have rung any bells, at least not in the same way a giant ""From the Director of"" promotion would have. Still, I know del Toro by name and I still didn't realize this was his film. Wayyy after it was already out of theatres I watched it on a plane. It was great.<br/><br/>Not only did the marketing not exploit any of the film's star power, it didn't even really give us any idea what it was about. The trailer just showed huge metal warriors battling Godzilla-like creatures, much in the fashion of recent mindless action movies such as Battleship (I did actually enjoy Battleship) or anything from the recent Transformers franchise. I hypothesis that this complete disconnect must have been intentional. In this way Pacific Rim attracted the same audience as the previously mentioned movies. A huge audience base that is easily swayed and turned on by special effects, battle scenes, and stuff blowing up, but they are potentially turned off by something that could be considered ""cinema,"" or too arty. This audience needed to be brought in from the beginning.<br/><br/>As for the more savvy movie-goers, although turned off by the meat head marketing, they are generally more inquisitive than the average Transformers fan, and so it seems the producers relied on these movie-goer's inquisitive nature. Since it's an actual good film, the savvy will find their way to it eventually. This film's crappy marketing was actually a ploy to lure multiple demographics in subliminal ways, and thus mucho bank was made. Just a hypothesis.<br/><br/>FYI: According to Slashfilm.com, Transformers2 was the highest grossing, most negatively rated film in history, so getting the Transformers audience was just good business. The fact that the movie is also good is just a rare and wonderful freak, but not accidental, occurrence for the Transformers audience.<br/><br/>What makes Pacific Rim so great? Using a montage sequence and voice-over, in the first five minutes of the film we learn all about the world that Earth has become. Monster Kaijus have invaded from a dimension shifting portal in the ocean, humans have built fighting machines called Jaegers to combat the Kaijus, and this on-going threat, the conflict between the two entities has eventually just becomes a routine part of common culture. Then suddenly things change.<br/><br/>The set designs are spectacular. Hong Kong is specially tailored here to fit a Kaiju bashing society. The encampments where the machinery and pilots are based is a gloomy complex that looks like the inside of a submarine. Being a big budget action film, Pacific Rim relies heavily on computer-generated graphics and spectacular special effects for its visual telling. Truthfully I have no idea how any of these action scenes would have been shot as almost every one is an epic between giant monsters, earthy and not. But it is not the visuals alone that make this a great movie. Transformers has great visuals.<br/><br/>It is the script that is so awesome. Co-written by Travis Beachman and del Toro, it is a sci-fi monster movie, but it is the nuances that make the film so much fun to watch. All the intricacies of the world. For instance, two people whose brain functions combine in a process called ""the drift"" pilot Jaegers. Pilots' ability to drift effectively in unison is what creates great pilots. The drift is probably the single coolest thing about this film, and the idea is used later for purposes even crazier.<br/><br/>The Kaijus become so powerful that mankind is forced into a final standoff using all the remaining Jaegers against multiple super strong Kaijus. The prospects for humanity's survival look grim. In final act of the film a spectacular twist takes place thanks to some unlikely scientists, and the fate of all humanity hangs on their wild hunch, the functioning of the aging military machinery, and the drift between the last two standing Jaeger pilots. I wish I had seen this film in theatres. <br/><br/>Let's see if Pacific Rim 2 ever makes it from the hard-drive on Travis Beachman's desk to the screen. This time, I'd give it a chance.<br/><br/>More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"
"brando647","8","1","2","25 January 2014"," Awesome Visuals and Thin Plot/Characters; Fun Popcorn Cinema
","With all of the sequels, prequels, and remakes that flooded movie theaters in the summer of 2013, you would think audiences would be hungry for something original. Guillermo Del Toro, a modern cinematic visionary, does just that and creates an homage to Japanese giant monster films with PACIFIC RIM and the nation responds with a near universal shrug of disinterest and barely half of it's budget in box office returns. Thankfully, the movie found some massive love overseas and made a nice profit so as to not discourage Del Toro from any future endeavors (or any studios from hiring him again). While my daughter has become a fan of the early Godzilla films, I was never a fan of the Japanese kaiju genre and the closest I ever came was watching the Power Rangers as a child. But I know a good time when I see one and I knew a modern movie about giant robots battling giant monsters from the man who did BLADE II and the HELLBOY movies was worth checking out. The premise is simple enough: giant monsters dubbed Kaiju begin emerging from an interdimensional fissure on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. In an effort to combat these beasts, the human race has united in a program of constructing giant robots known as Jaegers, mentally controlled by two pilots. The movie is set more than a decade into the Kaiju war and we're on the losing end as the Kaiju attacks become more and more persistent. The Jaeger program is being shut down to reallocate the funds into creating giant coastal walls, but Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), the man in charge of the Jaeger program, isn't ready give in. He recruits Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), a former Jaeger pilot with a tragic past, for one last mission in hopes of ending the war once and for all.<br/><br/>I know there's a load of people out there shouting about how this movie isn't original and it ripped it this anime and that anime, and I don't care. I don't watch anime. I'm know Del Toro was heavily inspired by anime (he's a huge fan) and I'm more than happy to just revel in the love letter he's written to these Japanese genres in the form of PACIFIC RIM. It's not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one regardless. It's fun, visually gorgeous, and it's got some fantastic battle sequences, even if its story and characters are all pretty basic and shallow. This movie is eye candy, but it's epic level eye candy. The visual effects are spectacular and the movie's focal points, the Kaiju and Jaegers, are fantastically designed. Each of the robots and creatures has a unique design to stand out from the others though I only wish we'd had an opportunity to see them battle in broad daylight where we could truly appreciate all of the detail that went into them. Every battle happens at night, in rainstorms, etc. It's a missed opportunity and the closest we get is a nice series of shots of a Kaiju rampaging in Sydney, Australia. The entire movie is filled with vibrant colors and it's all beautifully shot. The film was shot by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and, if you're familiar with any of his previous work, you know to expect good things. PACIFIC RIM is, if nothing else, a visual feast with some brutal robot-on-monster battle action.<br/><br/>The rest of the film's elements are where it stumbles a bit. The cast is filled with an eclectic mix of talent. You've got Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi are the film's heroes who suffer from a lack of decent chemistry. As the pilots of our hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, they're our main focus. They've got a bit of depth to them with a little backstory behind them to explain why Raleigh (Hunnam) wants to avoid the Jaeger program and Mako (Kikuchi) wants so desperately to be a part of it. Unfortunately, I never felt much of a real spark between them. Idris Elba is the grizzled commander in charge of the Jaeger initiative. Elba is a talented man and provides one of the stronger performances as he riles up a passion in the men under his command to fight. We get comic relief in the form of the Jaeger program's science team, Newt (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), and Del Toro regular Ron Perlman has a sweet supporting role as a black market peddler of Kaiju remains. None of the characters are mind-blowingly developed but there's enough behind each of them to give them some motivation. The plot is paper thin: beat the monsters and destroy the source. There wasn't much effort put into plot elements, as this movie is all about the action. This means the section in the middle of the film while Raleigh and the rest of the Jaeger program ready for their final mission tends to drag. It's all about character development at that point and the characters were totally outshined by the robots/monsters so that's what we're aching to see by that point. Once the action kicks into gear in Hong Kong, it's all up hill from there.<br/><br/>PACIFIC RIM is spectacle cinema and it's a blast to watch, especially on the big screen. It's not an overly intelligent film and you're probably best off shutting down your mind, munching on some popcorn, and taking in the killer visuals. It's a fun experience I'm happy Del Toro got his love letter to Japanese giant monsters out of his system because he's still got a dozen other projects on his agenda that I'm excited about."
"stevenglowacki","6","1","2","24 January 2014"," Entertaining, but heavily clichéd
","While this movie was for the most part entertaining, featuring some rather gorgeous looking special effects shots, the plot and dialog leave something to be desired. I marked this review as containing spoilers only because I'm going to tell you that pretty much everything happens as one would expect it to happen in an action movie. Nearly every scene with dialog fulfills some overwrought trope of how things work in action movies. I kept hoping there was going to be some sort of interesting plot development, and felt entirely disappointed by the blandness of the plot. I'm hoping the one tiny twist to the plot was explored more in uncut footage; while there's significant time spent in the development of that part of the plot, the important information uncovered through those scenes is basically just acknowledged and the everyone moves on as planned.<br/><br/>There's also a gratuitously planted scene in the middle of an action sequence featuring Newton's cradle/balls for no interesting reason; even if there's an intended connection with the character named Newton, it's so heavy-handed that I couldn't believe it was actually being done."
"itrogo","7","1","2","22 January 2014"," Are you ready to be entertained?
","If you're having a bored weekend or a bad day please do yourself a favor and watch this very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The concept of the movie is simple. It's Jaeger(s) vs Kaiju(s) which means Hunter(s) vs Monster(s). The story is straightforward with some minor plot holes which aren't important in the end. This movie is all about entertainment. The pacing is great. There are rarely dull moments in the movie. The visuals are breathtaking! Keep in mind that I watched it only in 2D. Kudos to the crew who made that possible. The action scenes are amazing. I had to re-watch plenty of scenes just because I didn't see everything the first time. There is also some humor in it which is a nice break from the constant action.<br/><br/>Is there something I didn't like? I felt there was a lack of imagination considering the fact that the action happened most of the time in the Ocean. More battle locations would have been great. I also didn't like the love story. It felt awkward and wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>To conclude this review, Pacific Rim should not be taken too seriously. It succeeds for what it is; a visually gem and fails at delivering a rock-solid story."

Sophisticated enough for older audiences and audacious enough to bring us all back to our childhood wonderment of how great going to the movies could be. One of the strongest points is how the film doles out massive destruction and spectacular action without seeming too dark or serious.<br/><br/>I hear what people are saying.

","I read a lot of reviews that dissed Pacific Rim in favor of the future airing of Godzilla that they only anticipated. I also had to think those comments were true because I was captured by the ""trailer trap"".<br/><br/>All of us have to admit the trailer was AWESOME.<br/><br/>It may have been the best trailer ever.<br/><br/>I hope the actors, directors and producers of Pacific Rim believe me when I (and my very skeptical son) both agree that Pacific Rim kicked Godzilla's ass.<br/><br/>Kudo: Godzilla's voice could not have been better.<br/><br/>I guess they gave Wantanabee suppositories, because every time I saw his face it looked like he had to take a s h i t. If he would have done so, and screamed ""Godzilla"" on the toilet, I think he would have been a bit more believable.<br/><br/>Anywho, my daughter, Emily, agreed, that the underwater nuclear blast in P.R. was spectacular, authentic, and believable. Very nice work!<br/><br/>Chris"
"jackasstrange","4","2","7","30 November 2013"," Gaudy CGI and zero content
","Pacific Rim is an over the top film when the subject is and only is the special effects. It seems clear to me that it has a guaranteed Oscar nomination for the art direction achievement,and probably for Special Effects as well. However, in the other aspects, this film is just awful. If i gave a 4/10 score to this film, is all due to the technical aspects, i must say.<br/><br/>The plot is hilariously bad constructed, and its first 20 minutes or so is one of the worst introductions to a film that i've ever watched. It spends this initial minutes with flashbacks which suddenly pops out and disappears, what is a clearly attempt of director Guillermo del Toro like of doing an economy of time to a possible very long but much likely most coherent and entertaining development. It also seems clear that if the producers of this film had some decency and weren't planning to just make a fast money over a relatively short attention span audience, they would give a decent development to Pacific Rim in a prequel film. <br/><br/>Because dawn, the character development is bad. I couldn't care for the character that were in the screen, honestly. This was the main factor of why some people like me really didn't like this film. It don't assumes any compromises with the viewer, it don't involves the viewer. It just expect the viewer to sit and watch two hours of good special effects, without any plot or whats ever. It's really a shame.<br/><br/>Even the so- called 'Super Hero' blockbusters puts effort in making a watchable film with an acceptable plot. So as you see, it is a very inferior film even for the popcorn flicks standards nowadays.<br/><br/>I usually claim the films that uses much more the visual aspects instead of storytelling to be 'style over substance' kinds of films. But this one would be just style, since there is no substance or whatever to save it.<br/><br/>Not recommended. 4.5/10"
"pops87","2","2","7","20 November 2013"," Total nonsense with so many holes
","Hollywood treat people like brainless zombies. But since the general public goes to this kind of movies and make them money - they deserve it. 7.2 score and 400M earned says it all - mindless blockbusters are good investments.<br/><br/>I don't know even where to start. Why they put SCIENCE into SCIENCE-FICTION? Just call this kind of movies FICTION and I'm fine with it. This movie has as much in common with science as rock has in common with human (sorry evolutionists).<br/><br/>I can think of dozens of better ways to fight those monsters than create some pathetic power rangers style robots. Kurzweil and other trans-humanists are probably so happy that they put Neural Interfaces into this movie but even Kurzweil with his glories predictions didn't say about them in 2020. But lets forget about propaganda and stay with science. If You think those animated robots are anything like robots in future will be - You've watched too much Hollywood. First of all human-like robots are unpractical. They will never run as smooth as in this ""movie"".<br/><br/>But the real problem are G-forces. I slap from the monster to the head of this robot and those ""soldiers"" inside are DONE. G-forces would make their brains into mush. Not even mentioning felling down from 15KM - ohhh man I laughed so hard on this one...<br/><br/>The fantasy land portrayal of EMP is standard in Garbagewood but they hit new low here. ""Ohhh no! All our robots don't work cause of EMP. But wait we have the old one which is analog! It will work!"" You think since this film has total budget of nearly 200 million bucks - they would have at least one person saying ""it's not right"".<br/><br/>Newton's cradle's scene is just mind blowing. If anyone for even a second thought this is scientifically accurate - there is no help for You.

Let me start the ""What I've learned from this movie"" on message board - if it's not already there ! Eight (yes eight) choppers flying with 2500 TONS of load. Excuse screenplay write do You wanna buy a bridge ? Very cheap ! The fight underwater with the same speed as on the land !!! Yeah ! The pressure is nothing ! And those clichés...

The story was very flat. There was no depth to the characters or the story itself. I thought it was actually quite boring.<br/><br/>The film did have it's good moments though. The effects were amazing. The battle scenes were so good that I could not stop watching it. It was dark in places, but that didn't ruin the scenes. I thought the fighting was really well done. Also, the aliens looked awesome. They were very original looking and really looked horrible. I loved the way their mouths glowed blue. It really made them look good. Visually, it was an amazing film. It was a good looking movie.<br/><br/>The movie starred Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day & Max Martini. I am sorry to say that nobody really did a great job on this. I am not saying that the actors were fully to blame for this, but the characters were not easy to play because they had no personality.<br/><br/>This film is worth watching if you don't think about it.

"swedzin","6","2","7","25 July 2013"," Extremely fun, but it's noisy and already seen
","Guillermo Del Toro is back. And I was thrilled. What's he up to now? A film about giant robots and monsters fighting each other? That's cool! But wait a minute. This doesn't even sounds like Guillermo. Let's check it out. The movie itself, is actually a mixture of anime inspired robots and monsters, Godzilla, ""Robot Jocks"" and ""Independence Day"". You put all that in one big oven, and you get this noisy thing. I think that film was mostly inspired by anime films just like Robotech, or Macross Saga, that kind of stuff. And really, action scenes, were high voltage, over the top and I was really impressed. The story is set in 2020, where, in the deepest parts of the Pacific ocean, a breach is opened and from it, a massive, extremely large aliens, called Kaiju merges out to take over a planet ( the part about taking over is very much like in the Independence Day). So, humankind develops a 'Jeager' program. The program consists of a piloting a colossal robots to defeat monsters. It really sounds cool from the first moment, but when you see the film that's everything you ever saw before in Japanese, or US monster film, only this have far more outstanding special effects.<br/><br/>OK, let's start with the basic stuff CGI is excellent, no complaints here. Music score is good but, it's overused in the scenes, where the music is not even required and it's too dramatic at some points. Writing is a cliché the same story over and over, about a skilled pilot who lost his brother and he asked by the general to go back and help him the usual stuff. Good editing, good camera work, very well in fighting scenes. Well, this movie offers only good fight scenes. The props were good, the robot and monster design was badass, the interior design of robots and their robot base was good. The suits were very much like the one from ""Dead Space"" Isaac Clarke, anyone?<br/><br/>Now, the actors. Charlie Hunnam well, this role was easy, so he didn't do much with his character. He is a typical hero that needs to face with his demons. Don't get me wrong, he is a solid actor but, he didn't do much here. Idris Elba is one of the best actors in the film, and he was good, but sometimes, he was from flat to explosive performance. And his character was pretty predictable. Rinko Kikuchi was new to me here, and she did a pretty good job. We got Clifton Collins Jr. he was OK, and we have Robert Kazinsky (best known as Warlow from True Blood), who plays an a-hole pilot with the cutest bulldog ever. And those two scientist my God, the worst characters in the film, they were just yelling at you and the camera, they were so annoying. And we have Ron Perlman, who obviously got stuck in his Hellboy performance, and his character was an a-hole not far from Hellboy Del Toro maybe wanted Perlman here to look like Hellboy, because he was wearing a red pimp-like suit and well, only the golden shoes were an exception. <br/><br/>So, I do recommend this film, it's pretty enjoyable and it takes away those two and a half hours pretty fast, but don't have to much expectations because it's a déjà vu film and that makes it crappy."

","Well, where to start ?<br/><br/>This movie was mediocre, really mediocre, probably one of Del Toro's worst so far.<br/><br/>The plot could've been written by an elementary school kid, acting was terrible (besides Idris Elba) with over stereotyped characters and pre-school dialogues.<br/><br/>The only good part could've been the robot vs kaiju fights, if : 1) There weren't, like, all shot during the night and under the rain 2) The use of 3D wouldn't have been so poor 3) The script of the fights wasn't so poor : ""oh wait i got a giant sword on my frame, i just forgot to use it""<br/><br/>This movie takes over all the clichés you could get from a direct-to-TV Japanese robot movie / anime, from the ridiculously cliché and overplayed characters, the linear, over predictable script and the ridiculous monsters (jap generic name) and robot (German to sound ""cool"", like Japanese do).<br/><br/>So, yeah, if u guys expect to see a B/ ScyFy grade Japanese robot movie, you can watch this one, or the bazillion movies japs already have made over 30 years.<br/><br/>If you expect to see a good movie, then go watch something else. <br/><br/>I know that Del Toro wanted to enter the Asian market with this movie but, honestly, Asian market ain't japan... Being Asian here, and having watched it with an Asian crew (mostly), can't say anyone was impressed. <br/><br/>Guillermo should probably have hooked up with Mamoru Oshii to do this thing in anime version, it would probably have been much better."

","First of all, Pacific Rim is one of a few movies that is worth watching in a movie theater. Special effects were good, both the robots (a.k.a Jaegers) and the monsters (a.k.a Kaiju) were well polished and looked realistic. The action went on and on leaving me squeezing the chair waiting to see how it's going to end. So - special effects: check; action: check. These are most important things that an action movie must have for the viewers to have a good time. <br/><br/>However, the biggest problem for me was the whole 3D thing. It just doesn't work for me as well as the old 2D. Just like in the Avengers it was ruining the movie for me to enjoy it at it's fullest. You simply can't notice little details that make the movie so wonderful. I must mention that the acting wasn't so remarkable either. The dialogs were short, but at some parts completely unnecessary. It wasn't very noticeable since it's an action movie so people came to see giant robots fighting giant monsters and how delightful it was for everyone to get what they wanted.<br/><br/>I don't know what's wrong with adventure and/or action movie creators, but it seems like they can't leave out cheesy jokes out. And what a big deal they make out of it - the joke scene must be emphasized even if it's very short it can't be a minor. Of course one joke isn't enough, when I saw the first one, I smiled a little thinking - yeah, it was OK, after a while, the second joke was forced in the movie and... I don't know, I just facepalmed. Perhaps I'm just making this too much of a deal, but such little things sting me like a bee.<br/><br/>Another small thing that made me frown was that a little bit more thought in underwater sound effects could have been put. I mean come on, creatures that can walk the surface and roar, can't just scream underwater. Also the plot is kind of predictable, but not all of it! At some point I decided to take sip of my drink, apparently it was very bad timing, because at the same moment an unexpected jump scare-like scene started and I spat the drink on my knees. My point is that you know what the characters must do, who lives and who dies, how the movie is going to end, but you don't know how they are going to do it. I hope that sentence made sense. <br/><br/>So, Pacific Rim is worth watching in a movie theater simply because it's so beautiful and full of action with no secret puns - just robots vs monsters. Some moments are indeed annoying, but they were nothing compared to the excitement that I felt afterwards."
"Staffenburgen","6","2","7","21 July 2013"," Entertaining, but like most summer blockbusters, it rings hollow
","Let me start this review by saying that I am in no way familiar with this genre of film. That being said, I am quite familiar with Guillermo del Toro, and I have always admired his ability to emotionally attach the audience to his characters. In his previous films, like Hellboy and Pan's Labrynth, the audience was equal parts captivated by the human elements of his characters and by his visionary approach to CGI. Walking in to Pacific Rim, I was expecting something along those lines; a movie with beautifully crafted special effects with delicate attention to story and character. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film is much more traditional in its approach to being a summer blockbuster. As per the usual, it doesn't waste any time building suspense or developing characters. By the end of the first minute, we've already seen a massive Kaiju destroy a city. How this Kaiju came to be there is glossed over in a 30 second monologue. To me, I would've preferred a more detailed explanation of such things; already it seemed apparent that the story would take a backseat to the CGI. <br/><br/>And that's pretty much how this movie went. The story and the characters within it are all flat and boring, and are portrayed by clearly uninspired actors. Not enough time is given to the story; all of the time (and budget) has clearly been allocated to the special effects. <br/><br/>Now, I see several people fiercely defending this movie, and they are all saying that people shouldn't see movies about robots fighting aliens if they expect a top-notch story and some inspired acting. This defence just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>It might sound so far like I hated this movie, but I really didn't. It is an average summer blockbuster, nothing more, and the only reason I am disappointed is because arguably one of modern cinema's better directors is at the helm. <br/><br/>That being said, this film does do one thing right. When the Jaegers and the Kaiju clash, the results are nothing less than spectacular. The scope of these fights is quite unlike anything I have seen in rival blockbusters, and was a real treat in 3D. <br/><br/>The key to enjoying this film is to expect a simple blockbuster movie with some serious eye-candy. Don't make the mistake I did and expect anything more. <br/><br/>RATING: 6/10"
"norrisj15","6","2","7","21 July 2013"," Pacific Rim: The Giant Monster Movie of 2013
","Preface: I will not spoil the movie for anyone interested in seeing it. I will provide my opinion on the overarching plot line and general scenario as well as the acting before giving the movie a rating and a recommendation.<br/><br/>INTRO:<br/><br/>Set in a slightly futuristic world, Pacific Rim in a ode to many of the giant monster movies of the past. For those that remember watching Godzilla versus Mothra, or any of the other hilariously metamorphosed creatures from the creative Japanese minds of the late 1950's and 60's, will feel drawn into the sci-fi world of Pacific Rim. The setting changes from various locations on the Pacific coastline during the film until a final stop at a base in Hong Kong where most of the film's action takes place. <br/><br/>ACTING:<br/><br/>Animation aside, the acting was surprising good for a film that was less plot and more fight scene. The cast was full of unknown names to me. The sole recognizable face was Charlie Day or Charlie from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. He plays a PhD biologist who isn't afraid to remind people he's a doctor and is interested in learning all he can about the Kaiju. His character is very spastic and full of energy, which reminds me very much of Charlie from Always Sunny. This obviously shows the role wasn't too much of a stretch for Day's acting chops.<br/><br/>The lead male role is played by Charlie Hunnam (who upon further investigation stars in Sons of Anarchy, never seen it) who is one of the Jaegar pilots. Charlie's character Raleigh (yep like the city) is a gifted pilot, one of only two pilots to ever be able to operate a Jaegar by himself for any extended period. Charlie plays the role well, interjecting his positive attitude wherever possible (most of the time in the middle of a fight). Raleigh loves to fight and often acts without any idea of self worth when in battle. He is your typical hot shot, selfless hero.<br/><br/>The female lead is played by Rinko Kikuchi (never heard of anything she's been in). Her character Mako Mori is also a Jaegar pilot. She goes through an internal, emotional struggle related to the Kaiju and her childhood throughout the film. Overall, her acting is good and she gives enough to have you buy into her character even though much of the plot and motivation of actions by and towards her are questionable. I'd give more about her character, but it would be revealing too much of the plot and ending of the movie.<br/><br/>TAKEAWAYS:<br/><br/>Overall, if you're walking into the movie to see a visually appealing, monster flick you're in for a treat. If you're looking for any logical plot line or strong character development go see none of the movies currently in theaters and pop in the Se7en DVD sitting in the stack next to the TV. <br/><br/>This is a movie that if seen at all should be viewed in the theater. The visual experience of a home TV diminishes the major redeeming factor that Pacific Rim has: the ability to captivate and immerse an audience in a visually stimulating environment.<br/><br/>The rating that follows take into consideration the entirety of the movie experience. I would recommend anyone moderately interested to go see Pacific Rim, but the rating reflect the movie in comparison to movies as a whole.<br/><br/>RATING:<br/><br/>The film gets 3/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups."
"Rachelm00","7","2","7","21 July 2013"," A fun enjoyable film
","If you are looking for a masterpiece with deep artistic meaning this isn't for you. If you are looking for a fun film to help you remove yourself from the world for a bit then go see it. Yes the movie had flaws and inconsistencies but I still loved it. The action scenes were fun and the jaegers were awesome. One thing that I absolutely loved about this movie (which some people may hate) is that it didn't end in a kiss. It was quite a refreshing change and made far more sense in regard to their characters. I was also thrilled to see Burn Gorman in it and was immediately attached to his character (Gottlieb), though the other scientist just got on my nerves.<br/><br/>So yeah if you want to see a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously go see it"
"The-Sarkologist","7","2","7","20 July 2013"," A Remake of Godzilla vs Mechatron (if such a film exists).
","Sometimes there are movies that pretty much have no plot but are still a blast to watch, and Pacific Rim is one of those movies. In a way Pacific Rim does what the remake of Godzilla pretty much failed to do, and that was to pay tribute to the original Japenese monster movies where huge creates come out of the ocean and begin wrecking havoc on major metropolitan regions (and Tokyo simply seemed to be a magnet for that). In a way if one could say that this movie was a remake then it would probably be a remake of Godzilla vs Mechatron (if such a movie exists).<br/><br/>Basically huge monsters had been appearing out of the Pacific Ocean, and after wrecking havoc on a number of cities, humanity built giant mecha to do battle with them. However due to the fact that the human brain can not control a mecha by itself, they ended up designing them to have two pilots. At the beginning of the movie though one of the mecha messes us and they decided that they will scrap the program and instead build a massive wall around the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>The problem is that the wall simply does not work, so they decide to go back to fighting the monsters with the mecha, and also looking for a way to block the hole in the Pacific Ocean from where these monsters come. Basically other than this there is really not that much deep to write about the film. Okay, there are the standard themes of the value of team work, and also the idea that somehow we can belay the apocalypse through some rather ingenious plans, or through good old fashioned self-sacrifice, but then one shouldn't really think too deeply about a film that is about mecha beating up monsters.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, the film is set in Hong Kong, which is always a winner for me (as long as the film is a good film because there are plenty of films set in Hong Kong that are pretty ordinary, but this film isn't one of them) and it is pretty cool watching the mecha and the monster having a massive fight on Connaught Road in Central District (I love show off how I know the intricacies of Hong Kong). Oh, yes, I should mention that it is pretty slow going for the first half, but then when the monsters come out of Hong Kong harbour and the fight begins then, well, the gloves are off."
"Thomas-Giffin","7","2","7","20 July 2013"," Great fun
","This was an interesting film.<br/><br/>Interesting because I could see so many influences from other films and genres present. You have noticeable nods to anime, godzilla, Top Gun, Transformers, previous Del Toro films and huge blockbuster films like Independence Day and War of the World.<br/><br/>And it was a good, fun film.<br/><br/>I was expecting a bright, colourful action film with minimal story and pathetic characters. Instead, what I got was a bright, colourful, epic action film with minimal story and reasonable characters.<br/><br/>First of all, the colour palette. <br/><br/>It looks incredible, the deepest blues, the neon of Hong Kong, the lighting. All incredible. The scenes indoors in Hong Kong reminded me most of Hellboy 2 with the oranges and reds present. The film looks like live action Manga and that works to the film's advantage because it keeps everything from becoming too dour, somber and moody. <br/><br/>And aside from the colour palette, the other huge nod to Del Toro's back catalogue is the design of the Kaiju themselves. Looking much like steroid pumped Hellboy rejections, these monsters are huge, varied, capable of massive destruction and provide perfect opponents to the man made Jaegers.<br/><br/>And the Jaegers themselves are hugely impressive feats of CGI. Constantly reminding us of the sheer, implausible scale of the them is a consistent joy whilst watching the film and each of the few that appear on screen are varied and recognisable. <br/><br/>When the action does start, it is massive. Hugely impressive but there are some points I really want to make about the action scenes and it directly contradicts the action scenes in Man of Steel, because they're pretty similar in terms of scope and collateral damage.<br/><br/>Firstly, Del Toro makes an effort to show the streets and worlds emptied of people before the Kaiju go crazy on land. They're all in shelters and so when the Jaeger and the Kaiju fight and buildings are going over and entire areas are getting destroyed, there's no mass killing of people. In Man of Steel, everyone is caught up the catastrophe and you assume that the death toll must be in the hundreds of thousands.<br/><br/>Secondly, when Superman and Zod smash the hell out of each other, there's no threat, no danger. It's just punch, punch, fly through building, smash into the ground. Boom Boom Boom without any sense that they're doing any damage to each other. In Pacific Rim, the pilots gets battered around, cut up, bloodied. They're in danger! It's a small point but it makes the fights in Pacific Rim much more gripping and intense.<br/><br/>And this partially works because of the characters and the cast. They're not original, hugely complex and most of them are little more than decoration but they serve their purpose and some actually stand out as being good fun. Idris Elba is pretty damn good as the gruff, mysterious commanding office. Charlie Hunnam is fine as the washed up pilot given a second chance. Rinko Kikuchi is great as the potential love interest. They're not new takes on original characters but they're done well here. <br/><br/>So it is left to the story to fall flat. The whole 'mind drifting' idea was clearing created as a potentially novel way to introduce character drama and interaction between characters but the whole idea never quite hits, despite the pseudo-scientific jargon around the idea. And the whole reason for the Kaiju being there is underwhelming for sure, them being there provides the conflict but the explanation is weak. There are also pretty big plot holes and stupid decisions that get made by the characters don't ruin the film, but it's certainly no where near as clever as it means to be.<br/><br/>All in all. I got what I expected. It's like Del Toro looked at Transformers and Godzilla and thought ""Hey, I can do better than that."" and he did better than them."
"shark-43","8","2","7","18 July 2013"," Giant Monsters/Giant Robots/Giant Fun
","I guess I was just in the mood for a Giant Monsters/Giant Robots movie and didn't even know it. PACIFIC RIM has its faults but overall, it packs a punch! Good fun entertainment. I loved the way the monsters looked and overall, I thought the special effects were excellent. Del Toro is such a talented director - I loved PAN'S LABYRINTH as well his early underrated vampire flick KRONOS. The acting is rather uneven in this film - the lead guy seemed a bit dead eyed and stiff but I loved the Asian actress from BABEL. The wacky scientists seemed to be in a different movie but I loved their story line. I can see how this might not be everyone's cup of tea but I really enjoyed it."
"jlcouper","6","2","7","18 July 2013"," Pacific Rim should have been more fun.
","I'll be honest. I was disappointed. I know what kind of film this is and I know what it's representing. That's why I'm excusing the cheese-ball-anime whatever dialogue.<br/><br/>But...I still didn't give the slightest damn for the main guy, or the supporting actress! You have to like the main characters for the film to be somewhat of a compelling experience, right?<br/><br/>It was just too simple; I read reviews saying it was 'more than just a Michael Bay flick' yadayadayada. We've already seen this movie before. I wanted something a little smarter, maybe something like what Raimi did for the horror genre. That's what I expected with how reddit, (and even some of the critics) blew it up.<br/><br/>The whole psych-connection robo mechanic was interesting, but couldn't they have gone a little further?<br/><br/>Some of the fights were exciting, and the visuals were certainly the best we might see, (for the time being) but the fights didn't bring anything new or outstanding.<br/><br/>I also wish Charlie Day's character wasn't presented as 'the smart-dumb guy'; I wanted to maybe see some what of a contrast from 'Always Sunny'! Ron Perlman was fun and all, but you know he was there for shits and gigs. An after thought character, as was Day's sidekick. They should have just stuck with Day and developed him more.<br/><br/>Oh well. I don't mind that people are enjoying themselves with this one, it's supposed to just be fun and entertaining. But even the fun with this one just doesn't size up to what has already happened this summer; In my opinion, ""Into Darkness"" has had the best sci-fi presentation so far, but we can still do better than that."
"JeffJones-444","6","2","7","18 July 2013"," Pacific Rim is visual candy, sensory overload
","Recently watching Pacific Rim in 3-D IMAX I was struck by the amazing, astonishing visuals, but left empty by many of its story choices.<br/><br/>The film makers choice to open with a quick catch-up,telling us the ocean cracked and that Kaiju' are already here left me a little depressed. I would have loved to see the tension and battles that were first fought. Instead, it's battle after battle, and gets a little tedious after a while. The special effects are good, but at times went by so fast I couldn't tell what the image was. I thought, why spend all that money. Overall, it was a very entertaining movie, but just not at the level I was hoping it would reach."

The detail on the Kaiju and Jaeger's was excellent and the action scenes were fantastic. <br/><br/>Unfortunately despite the positives i couldn't say was this anything more than an average movie for me.<br/><br/>I found the acting to be pretty bad to the point it was borderline corny and this really spoiled the film for me.<br/><br/>I wouldn't discourage anyone from going to see this you just have to know what you are getting so you won't be disappointed.

"mariogamer2000","9","2","7","12 July 2013"," Spectacular (QUIK REVIEW)
","**IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE TRAILER OR READ THE PLOT, THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS REVIEW THAT WILL SPOIL THE FILM FOR YOU. I simply just don't want to get black listed, IMDb are very strict.** <br/><br/>This film was amazing. To anyone who watched the trailer and thought, 'Oh another transformers', you are wrong. Trust me.<br/><br/>This film was fantastic. It gets gets straight into the film, It tells you, this is what happened on earth, it tells you about the kaiju and the Jaeger program. So its great for people who have come to the cinema to watch big robots fighting monsters, and it does a great job of doing that, even though its introduction is brief, its informative and your thrown into the situation immediately. <br/><br/>So now we have, Raleigh played by Charlie Hunnam, who is like the Luke skywalker of the film. Was his performance great? No but it wasn't bad either. His character wasn't given too much depth as a main character should of, apart from the opening scene which sets his characters story, I didn't really connect with the character as much as I would of liked to. Rinko Kikuchi(Forgive me If I got the name wrong) plays Mako, a tough young woman who is driven by revenge. And I must say her character was bad ass, and the performance from Rinko was pretty good(First film I have seen her in a film). But my favorite performance in the film, and yes it really is, Idris Elba. OMG I really cant believe I'm saying this but hes was fantastic. Out of all the characters he was given the most depth(Strange considering he wasn't the main character). But again hes was great, he gave a very good performance and I connected with his character more than anyone else.(We are kan-cel-in the apocalypse!!!) Last but not least, Ron pearlmon. He plays this sought of happy go lucky pimpish person and he was hilariously great.(I mean he's always great)<br/><br/>Now to the part why most people paid the 8/10 pounds(Or dollars for the U.S) for a ticket. <br/><br/>The action. Oh my goodness, and I thought I've seen enough of it, this year from Man Of steel, Iron Man 3, but clearly after this film, I did not. One thing before I continue I would just like to say, the action scenes was nothing like Transformers, the fight scenes were slightly slower so you could see clearly what was going on. Unlike transformers when at times, seemed like a big mess of metal flying everywhere. <br/><br/>The fight scenes were just awesome, by far the best I've seen since...(I honestly can think of anything). I mean there were great and the CGI was outstanding, like not even at one point was I like, 'Ooo that's CGI'. I new it was all CGI but It just looked authentic and convincing. And its not all the time these films do that and that's when you know that a outstanding director had directed the film. Yess, Del toro did a fantastic job on this film, really great job. And scale of the robots were enormous but Del toro did a great job with framing the action scenes well. Not at any point in the film was any of the scaling unbalanced. <br/><br/>I really think pacific rim is a great pop corn flick that the whole family can enjoy, with a ton of great action sequences to feel you up. I highly recommend this. <br/><br/>So I'm going to give this film. 4 1/2 stars. (9/10) <br/><br/>Of course like many films it could of still been a touch better if there was more character development but that's fine. It knows what it is and it does it brilliantly. <br/><br/>I am sought of new to writing reviews, I've always been not bad with analyzing and giving my opinion on films but it is a lot harder when you have to write it.(I am slowly improving, even if its the speed of a snail) So thank you so much for putting up with my bad punctuation and reading my review. And I hope you have a great time when you watch this movie."

","This is Real Steel, Transformers, Godzilla and your favorite alien invasion action movie, all packed into one. The focus is on the visual effects and battle scenes, there are some interesting sci-fi ideas but minimal attention was devoted to their details, the acting is good, the plot is predictable but engaging and the character development is again minimal but enough (aka optimal).<br/><br/>We are all probably used to stunning effects by now so what makes this one different? I would say its the seamless fusion of so many ideas, Godzilla sized monster aliens and to combat them Transformer sized fight machines guided by humans in co-ordination(like in Real Steel but more intricate). Also unlike many action movies that try too hard to be emotionally deep and end up being miserably melodramatic or shallow, this one hits the sweet spot. Also there is at least something amusing about a metal brute wrestling a bulbous acid throwing flying Godzilla, right?<br/><br/>One disappointment for me was that there was potential for a lot of nice sci-fi conceptual depth but the details were mostly left out unless needed for comprehending the plot and also the acting performances could have been slightly better but Idris Elba was awesome in his role, even his voice was perfect for his dialogues.<br/><br/>On the whole a nice and refreshing movie, if the trailers give you a run of the mill feeling I would still recommend watching it (on the best screen possible), it might surprise you."
"troymerig","8","2","7","11 July 2013"," Solid Summer Movie
","I just got home from seeing Pacific Rim, and I have to say that it was a pretty good movie. It wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't a disappointment either. As expected, the special effects were stunning. I thought the robots were extremely well done and looked really awesome. The fight scenes with the monsters were also exceptional. Even if the monsters look similar to other movies (Cloverfield) they were still visually appealing. The plot was straightforward as one would expect, and it had few twists. However, a movie of this kind is not expected to have a superior plot full of surprises. Pacific Rim is meant to provide the viewers with 2+ hours of pure entertainment, which I can say it did.<br/><br/>I did have a problem with some of the movie being cliché. I won't give any specifics, but some of the parts have been seen in countless other movies. In my opinion, though, the interesting concept and special effects more than made up for the platitudes. I thought the acting was solid but not exceptional. Rinko Kikuchi bothered me a little bit, but I think it was her character rather than her who I disliked. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies or end-of-the- world films. It obviously won't win an Oscar, but it accomplished what it set out to do.<br/><br/>I'd give it a 8/10."

","I had high expectations and was hyped up to see Pacific Rim, but as soon as I was into the first 10 minutes I realized what kind of context the story would be put in. <br/><br/>I want to start with the positive aspects: The visuals are just breathtaking. Every second there was action I found myself scanning the screen as fast as I can to notice how they rendered the CGI and put together the visuals. One of the best eye-candies that my brain has witnessed recently. But this is how I mostly spent my two hours at the cinema, caring about pretty much nothing else about the movie. This takes us to the negative side of my review: The acting, the story, the part when you bite down the cake and the bits that hit your palate is so cheesy and done so many times, I kept thinking during the movie if I could ever stand to see another Hollywood movie in my life again. The dialogues, the predictable tear-jerking moments, pep-talks, plot progress, characters, cute elements that make the audience go ""aww"", everything was there in the most cheesy and kitsch way possible. <br/><br/>I could just not believe Del Toro would come up with such ""Teen-oriented"" action in this way. But this might be my problem, as the director himself said that the movie should not be taken ""realistically"". Yes, I am aware that it is a sci-fi fantasy action movie where it should be viewed with an open mind with imagination, but the holes in the plot just put the movie in the awkward grey area where the scenes sometimes just feel like they've been glued together and manipulated to have it ""by the Hollywood book""! I won't give any spoilers but you'll hear some dialogues that are clearly put there to add excitement and suspense, and the next scene you'll see some actions completely disproving previous statements. <br/><br/>All in all I enjoyed the movie very much visually, but the intellectually questionable aspects of the plot really stripped the movie of the complete fun that I could've gotten out of it. <br/><br/>You should go see it definitely, but just prepare to experience it with a teenager perspective.<br/><br/>To enjoy Pacific Rim fully, just have an open mind. Actually, I'd like to rephrase that: Keep your ""Eyes"" open, and your mind a little closed!"
"berbasloth","5","2","8","31 July 2013"," Just couldn't get on board with it.
","I'm starting to think that there is a direct correlation between my level of anticipation and ultimate disappointment, the last three blockbusters I've seen have let me down, starting with Prometheus and Dark Knight Rises and now this.<br/><br/>That can't be true though because Inception and Social Network delivered and I couldn't wait to see them. Anyway yeah Pacific Rim, it's a strange one. I went in thinking this was gonna be the anti-Transformers, making sense and having a soul and in some ways it delivers but in others it just doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>I'm starting to think the internet has ruined movies for me, people are so quick to point out the minutest flaws in any movie that you end up looking for them. But this has flaws.<br/><br/>The plot for starters wouldn't be out of place in a mid 90's computer game and I'm not spoiling anything to reveal this as it's in the first 30 seconds of the film. The story is that there are monsters coming out of the earth called Kaiju, and to tackle these mankind built huge manned robots named Jaeger's. And the movie basically consists of giant battles punctuated with tacky dialogue and questionable acting.<br/><br/>The positives of the movie are obviously the design and look, which are at times spectacular. The robots are fleshed out and given enough appreciation to see them as a character, and Guillermo Del Toro takes time to show you how they work, unlike Transoformers which has two giant piles of indistinct silver hitting each other.<br/><br/>The CGI overall is amazing and the design as always with Guillermo Del Toro is delicious. But the problems with the movie however are with the script, I think maybe the movie was trying to engage a younger audience more as the acting and dialogue are at times incredibly tacky and contrived. <br/><br/>The plot is by the numbers all the way through and features a collection of wooden characters, and also features a series of plot points which don't make a lot of senses when looked at a little deeper.<br/><br/>Overall not my cup of tea, some impressive touches and the battles are fun but didn't satisfy my intellect remotely and left me feeling a bit indifferent towards it."
"diy_freak-1","Null","2","8","26 July 2013"," There are plot holes the size of a Kaiju
","""exciting from beginning to end, while still developing an awesome back story and character depth""<br/><br/>""trying to fit a mammoth plot into only two hours""<br/><br/>Jut a few quotes from other reviewers. I wonder what movie went to. The movie I saw had the following going for it:<br/><br/>The visual effects were undoubtedly incredible. The plot was not ""mammoth"", but thin, just enough for a sci-fi action flick.<br/><br/>The script and acting, however, were below par and annoyingly so at times. For instance, the two funny, sidekick scientists were rather ridiculous and obnoxious. The ""(awesome) character depth"" was nowhere to be found. Acting was consistently done very boldly, as in teenager boldly... rather clumsy with lots of attitude. So when several of our heroes give their life to save the world, one doesn't really care much about their 'dramatic demise'. <br/><br/>There are plot holes the size of a Kaiju. For instance, seeing how easy it was to obliterate two of the biggest Kaiju in one blow with the aid of a single nuclear explosion, one wonders why people went through all the trouble of creating the giant robots in the first place.<br/><br/>Add this all up and before you know it, you're annoyed by little details, like the zzzzzzzingy sound effects of 'the golden shoes' and the end scene were helicopters are announced to come rescue our heroes, directly followed by a shot of god knows how many helicopters flying over in a huge double formation. <br/><br/>Visually stunning, very well done CGI and action scenes: 8 Script, acting, well... pretty much every thing else: 3<br/><br/>I think that's called a ""D minus"" in US grades. I had hoped for much more. What a giant pity."
"JackHammer69","5","2","8","25 July 2013"," Great action, average acting, D-grade wannabe Australians
","I don't watch films with a critic's eye, so I will not mention anything about cinematography or plot holes really... I enjoy films most when I feel as though I've developed an emotional connection to one (or more) of the characters. On a slight sidenote, some people like listening to music purely for the shredding of the guitars, the pounding of the bass etc. or the melody in general. Others enjoy music most when they can connect to the song through the lyrics. This movie fell into the unfortunate category of ""good music - with uninspiring, cookie-cutter lyrics and bad vocals"".<br/><br/>The storyline was banged up to fit around the action sequences really. That wouldn't be a problem, had the actors actually breathed some life into their characters. Due to average performances and one-dimensional dialogue, I didn't give a damn about any of the characters. Charlie Hunnam sounded like he was narrating a B-grade video game throughout the entire movie; his performance was pretty weak. Idris Elba has been average in pretty much everything other than Prometheus (from what I've seen of him so far), but he does the job. Rinko Kikuchi did a nice job with what she had to work with. I enjoy Ron Perlman usually and he was pretty good in this, but nowhere near his usual charismatic self. I felt like punching the two Scientists in the face... One was a complete and utter nerd, the other was a strap-on to pop culture. Both of them completely unfunny and annoying.<br/><br/>However, let's move on to what really made me angry.<br/><br/>As an Australian, I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH how INSULTING it is when Americans attempt our accent. Not even Robert Downey Jr. in all of his brilliance can do it (and I'm a big fan of RDJ). STOP IT. GIVE IT UP. YOU'LL NEVER DO IT. It is pure ignorance and arrogance at the same time, thinking people will take you seriously.<br/><br/>Note: AUSTRALIANS DO NOT SOUND LIKE ENGLISHMEN WHO HAVE LIVED IN SOUTH Africa AND/OR NEW ZEALAND. Hire REAL Australians. There are tens of thousands of Aussies who would jump at the chance to feature in Hollywood Blockbusters.<br/><br/>Having said that, Max Martini's Australian accent was at least 75% better than Robert Kazinky's. Being a Brit, one would expect Robert to be pretty convincing, but no... The New Yorker kicked the Brit's ayess!<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was a letdown."
"cosmonadz","6","2","8","25 July 2013"," Pacific DIM
","After all the hype I was left a tad disappointed. OK it was full of action and the big scenes were well big but the acting left it feeling very flat. The story that the world is being attacked by gigantic creatures which required even bigger robots to fight them off was alright but it lacked any sort of introduction the movie just got off with a bang and then constantly grinds forward without any real story. You can think of this as Godzilla meets Transformers but with the acting and story ripped out. The only saving grace was Idris Elba he manages to carry the film forward with a good performance and the big action sequences take care of themselves. It didn't look terribly good in 3D IMAX and I don't think the proportion on the screen was too clever. The picture filled the screen to the bottom but not the top and the images were blurred on the faster sequences. I had expected big things from this film but the acting and story left me feeling a little sad. But on the plus size its an action fest with monsters and machines so not all bad!"
"jhn-holgate","5","2","8","24 July 2013"," Great monsters....ordinary acting
","People are giving this 10 stars?? Seriously? The first thing that struck me was the absolutely awful accents. If actors can't do an accent properly, they should just stick to their normal voice. The two 'Australians' (at least I think that's what they were suppose to be) were absolutely terrible. And Idris's English accent was pretty ordinary. In fact, apart from Rinko and Charlie, the acting was below what it should have been. The two 'science guys' were way over the top...but not believable. And Ron Perlman just couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. (sorry Ron!!)<br/><br/>But hey, I wasn't expecting to be riveted by the story line, I went to see Cloverfield V Transformers and visually, it was spectacular and really well done.<br/><br/>It felt a lot like it was trying to be Godzilla, with a few zany bits and giggles thrown in....some of which almost worked.<br/><br/>Leave you're brain at the popcorn stand and enjoy the visual feast. Was certainly worth a watch but I can't see myself adding it to the DVD collection."
"estebangonzalez10","5","2","8","23 July 2013"," Noisy, Loud, Visually Stylish but no humanity
","""Today we are canceling the Apocalypse!""<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is without a doubt Guillermo del Toro's biggest blockbuster movie and visually it doesn't disappoint. The main issue I had with this film had to do with its story and character development. I really didn't care for any of these characters and thought that the performances were pretty weak as well. The film relies entirely on the great visuals and awesome action scenes. This is what the Transformers action scenes should have looked like because the action scenes were great and the editing was done real smoothly (unlike in the Transformers franchise where there is so much editing during the action sequences that it is hard to follow). Fans of monster movies will really enjoy Pacific Rim because del Toro knows his craft, but if you are looking for a great storyline then you will be left disappointed like I was. Guillermo del Toro pays homage to those giant monster movies the Japanese started making several decades ago and it is sort of a love letter to them. Pacific Rim is visually stylish and it has some great monster and robot sequences, but there is hardly no humanity in this film despite it trying to with all the flashbacks and neural bridges mind blending scenes. It tries to illustrate the point of having humanity teaming up together to defeat these monsters, but I really didn't feel it and that is one of the main reasons why I didn't like this film. Despite the cool action scenes I felt the movie was dragging too much and it got more and more tedious as it moved on. I was disappointed with Pacific Rim and would much rather watch Hellboy over this.<br/><br/>Mankind has always looked to the stars for possible life forms, but what they didn't know was that it would come from the deep ocean. Monstrous creatures named Kaijus came through a portal from the bottom of the ocean and began destroying everything that was on their path. In order to stop them humans had to build these giant robots known as Jaegers. The Jaegers are controlled from within by two pilots who have their minds connected through a neural bridge; one pilot controls the left hemisphere of the robot and the other the right. The Jaegers are highly successful at first as they defeat the Kaijus and the pilots become the new superheroes, but as the years go by these Kaijus begin to adapt and come out even stronger than before. The Jaegers are beginning to be defeated and humanity is forced to build giant walls to try to keep these creatures away. However Marshall Stacker (Idris Elba) knows that the walls won't hold so he decides to create a resistance with four powerful Jaegers. He calls upon a former pilot named Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) to team up with rookie Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Along with another group of pilots these four Jaegers remain humanity's last hope for survival. Charlie Day and Burn Gornman play two scientists who are studying a way to counterattack the Kaijus. <br/><br/>The lead performances from Hunnam and Kikuchi are pretty weak for an action movie. I really never felt chemistry between them and was disappointed with their performances. Idris Elba is a great actor, but I never felt connected to his character either. The rest of the pilots didn't have a backstory or anything that allowed us to care for them either. The two scientist were mostly added for comedic relief and I wasn't very impressed. My favorite performance came from Ron Perlman (Hellboy), an underground lord who trafficked dead Kaiju body parts. He had a very small role, but I thought those scenes were the most interesting ones of the movie. I liked the action scenes, but they get tiresome after a while and I needed to care more for the characters in order to enjoy this more. Pacific Rim is just too ridiculous and it suffers from a weak screenplay. It is a very noisy film with no character development whatsoever. Pacific Rim is one of Guillermo del Toro's weakest films to date (along with Pan's Labyrinth which is way overrated)."
"pinkled5","6","2","8","22 July 2013"," All Style No Substance
","The Good: Some of the best special effects in recent memory. CGI effects are beautiful and seamlessly integrated with actual footage. Fight scenes are satisfying. The scale of the battles felt authentic.<br/><br/>The Bad: Very thin plot elements. Characters are shallow and not developed well (despite the screenwriters obvious efforts). Nothing to make you care about the battles or their outcomes.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This movie looks great but is easily forgettable. There is nothing of substance to make you really care about this film. It's worth seeing on the big screen but I would recommend the matinée price if available."

Enter 2 new characters- supposed to be funny but try hards and it really didn't work with a mash of bad accents, big egos and badly played 'geeks'. My way of describing this film is transformers meets power rangers with a stereotypical cast and cliché script.

","Another apocalyptic World War vs aliens movie that will make teenage boys and those who get sexually aroused by weaponry, war and destruction, very happy. <br/><br/>This movie is packed with non stop action and testosterone. If you're a Sci-Fi fan expecting to see a Sci-Fi movie, it is essentially devoid of science. It is basically mindless, mind numbing, loud, constant explosions and destruction. <br/><br/>It makes humans look so stupid and ridiculous, I found myself almost wanting humans to lose, and believe me, the alien protagonists do not inspire sympathy. <br/><br/>It is nearly 100% CG, 100% destruction, and 10% story. The acting is well enough but, again, this movie was written and directed for the immature, and teenage boys and those sexually aroused by weaponry and war. The 5 second back story of the aliens was only established as an excuse to show ginormous robots to fight hand to hand combat on a giant scale. <br/><br/>And god forbid aliens ever visit and see our movies like this, because they would almost certainly declare humans a lost cause. And rightfully so."

But the plot is just great, what can one expect from a movie directed by Guillermo del Toro. I can't put in words how surprised I was when I left the theater.

","In the near future, a crack opens up deep in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, unleashing mysterious monsters who can only be fought off by the robots humans have built as a defense.<br/><br/>I went into Pacific Rim with mediocre expectations. I thought, ""this will be a fun action movie that I will probably forget about in a day or two,"" but after seeing it, my mind was completely blown. I came out of the movie completely in love with the characters, the plot, and, honestly, even the monsters (a.k.a. Kaiju). Sure Pacific Rim has it's flaws, but the overall experience I had when watching this movie was one of the funnest, most heart wrenching, and just overall fantastic movie experiences I have ever had. Ever. I highly recommend people to go see this movie while it's still in theaters, because it has a pretty kick-ass plot, amazing characters you will wish were real so you could be friends with them, and just the right amount of monster vs. robot action. 10/10<br/><br/>*Note if you were thinking you wouldn't like this movie because maybe you're a girl, or maybe you hate action movies, or maybe both, I sill recommend this movie because I am both of those and I LOVED it."
"thewillt08","7","2","8","19 July 2013"," A Summer Sensation
","Don't judge a movie by other movies. That basically sums up what I have to say about Pacific Rim. In all honesty when I first heard about this movie I had no intention of seeing it. I immediately thought of a Michael Bay wannabe try to do what he does with a million explosions and no story. I thought giant robots mindlessly fighting Godzilla Cloverfield monsters were stupid. After actually seeing it I can gladly say I was wrong. <br/><br/>Was Pacific Rim a mindless violent movie perfect for summer? Kind of, the action in this movie was state of the art. Let me get that out of the way. Seeing a giant robot punching a monster in the ocean was fun. The destruction wasn't over the top either. I was also concerned about the frequency of the action and surprisingly it mixed in well with the story. There was a very good balance between the fighting and the story with the humans and understanding the monsters. There were three of four real fight scenes with monsters and robots and the four scenes were so worth it. They were also really well placed and spread out. There wasn't action scene after action scene. There is one in the beginning, another smaller one or two in the middle, and then the incredible ending.<br/><br/>The major concern was the story for me. The acting didn't have to be superb and it wasn't but it was better than I expected. Jax form Sons of Anarchy is the main character and he does a good job but I can't help but think he plays the same guy in everything. There was a scene or two where I saw Jax on screen and not the actual guy. The story itself if basic and is explained in a prologue in the first few minutes and that was probably the best part of the movie. I was glad the movie started in the middle of the war. It was a smart movie in my opinion because the beginning if the war wasn't as important. There was still enough time do dive into the characters and fall in love with them.<br/><br/>Charlie Day is in this movie and although I don't think he fit the movie he was a strong addition. He plays an entertaining scientist who studies the monsters and trues to understand them. This was another interesting part of the story I found interesting. This was strength and the biggest weakness. The story was a lot better than I expected but it was rushed. His character and his story were really rushed. He does a few things and meets Ron Pearlman, and he is also awesome in this movie, then he does something else, and then he figures out the big question, thin the movie ends. I wish there was more time spent on the story but then again that would have taken away from the action that drew the audience in. <br/><br/>The most interesting part of the story was the robots themselves. In the beginning we learn they were created solely to fight the monsters. The fact that all the world leaders came together and with the technology built these robots quickly. I didn't really buy that 100% but it was something I had to look past but these things are operated by two humans and their better the relationship between the two people, the better the robot it and the better it fights. Wow, awesome, did not see that coming and I loved that. If somebody tried to pilot the robot by themselves their mind basically explodes. It is too much to handle so touché to the movie, I enjoyed it. It adds complexity to these robots and it was awesome. This brought in the aspect of character relationships which is super important in any movie.<br/><br/>The relationship between Jax and the Asian girl is strong and necessary. I wrote this review long after I saw the movie so I can't remember names. Anyway, their backstory is really cool something I enjoyed. The flashback with her as a little girl with the monsters attacking was emotional and impactful. The main relationship was between the girl and the general. The general is the best actor in this movie and he does the best job out of anybody. Every leader has a memorable speech before the final battle. I loved Bill Pullman's in Independence Day and in this movie it was good in the moment but by now I can't even remember what he said to make everybody cheer. <br/><br/>Overall, Pacific Rim is a good movie with a fair balance of action and story. I saw this movie because people raved and were so excited for it so I had to give it a shot. I went in wanting anything but Transformers and I left with a big smile on my face. It is a great summer blockbuster and is a popcorn movie. It is a good way to spend the day. When it comes out on blu ray I will buy it and watch it with my friends and enjoy it. Other than that it will sit in my cabinet and be watched every now and then. The movie did its job so I give it the WillyT Honorable Mention."
"kgprophet","5","2","8","16 July 2013"," For Kids?
","Yikes, I was being given many assurances that this film was the Bees Knees. It was the great new franchise that would have everybody wearing PR t-shirts and buying PR toys. In Asia, probably yes. I really think I gave this film a fair chance at wowing me. And it did for the first 30 minutes or so. The imagery was fantastic, as in Grand Canyon fantastic. Then it was a long, long, touchy feely group exercise with our young cadets. Many people I'm sure will harken back to 1997's Starship Troopers when watching scenes of rivalry between soldiers. All I could think of as these scenes dragged on was how much more edgy director Verhoeven was with similar scenes, and thus far more interesting.<br/><br/>Afterwards, I'm surprised how Del Toro, the director of Pan's Labyrinth, does not make a film like this without being edgy? I think it is that element that prevents this film from appealing to adult audiences. Certainly there is 'grit' in the production design. But all the gouges and chipped paint everywhere was actually a bit too distracting as well. For a military operation, they have no regard whatsoever in the upkeep of their facilities and machines. I certainly can give credit to Del Toro for doing a great job on his first big budget summer tentpole.<br/><br/>But now I will go on about the obvious decision to mask the quality of the effects by having each and every monster vs robot battle take place at night and in the rain. The reason is the same as 1998's Godzilla. Because to sell the size of these 8 story tall creatures, they had to be able to blend in with their surroundings. Since the effects apparently weren't good enough, they get shrouded in murky rainy scenes. Another major aspect to this robot warrior world is the need for the two drivers to psychically link to each other by experiencing each other's traumatic memories (?!). I know what the intention was, to make this a more Avatar-like world where your 'spirit' world must be linked to your physical world. But really, is driving an oversized tank much harder than say, flying a commercial airliner in the near future?<br/><br/>Eventually this kind of story manipulation to get the backstory and weaknesses of each character spelled out failed to get me excited. It started to feel more by-the-numbers screen writing, a complaint I had with Star Trek: Into Darkness. But I was encouraged by the fact that this was not a sequel, and Del Toro is a far more respectable director than Michael Bay. The best feeling I got from this mess was that I would love for Del Toro to direct one of the new Star Wars films. Not that Abrams would do a bad job, but Del Toro brings a dark element (in a disturbed kind of way) to his work. In PR the only hint you get of that is the side character played by Hellboy's Ron Perlman.<br/><br/>I hope this plays well with a younger audience, I just had really nothing to attach to with this world. The big robots were OK, but the fight scenes were not satisfying at all. The monsters were too undefined. What's the exact difference between a 4 and a 5 monster? Those kind of details would be interesting to us adults."
"zetes","7","2","8","15 July 2013"," The action is fun. The characters are bland.
","Guillermo del Toro aims straight for the big summer blockbuster with this giant robots vs. giant monsters (actually referred to as kaiju in the movie) flick. I have to admit, I find del Toro's films a little undercooked most of the time - I kind of wish he'd return to his earlier, simpler stuff like Cronos and The Devil's Backbone. Even Pan's Labyrinth, in my opinion, lacks personality. The big problem here is with the characters. The lead, Charlie Hunnam (the star of Sons of Anarchy), is about the dullest protagonist in recent memory. Idris Elba, who gave an all-time great television performance in The Wire, is quite boring. About the only two actors who register are Rinko Kikuchi - mostly because she's an adorable Japanese girl - and Charlie Day (of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, a show on which Guillermo del Toro once appeared as an actor), who brings the same manic energy he usually has, and perhaps comes off as a bit too much. Ron Perlman also has a nice little role, little more than a cameo. When there aren't giant monsters on screen, the film can drag. It mostly makes up for that, though, when the action starts. The good, old fashioned monster smashdown does not disappoint. I'd give it a slight recommendation."

The Special Effects are spectacular and the Robots vs. Monsters fight are great. We have three big fights, one at the beginning, one at the middle and at the end leaving some room for some human drama and some silly sci-fi stuff.

There are so many additional movies here (training, discovery, the aliens, genetics, etc.) that this movie could span many hours to tell the story. Instead, the story, told in excellent fashion, provides the detail we need to cheer for our heroes. If you disagree, post here to tell me what I missed. Enjoy this one!!"

","Pacific Rim is by far the best movie of the year. Guillermo Del Toro has once again proved himself to be a master of cinema. From the very beginning you are immersed in a world that every child dreams of, where giant monsters and robots duke it out for the fate of our world. The story centers on Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), a retired Jaeger pilot who is brought back into the world of combat by Stacker Pentecoast (Idris Elba) who hopes to bring and end to the kaiju once and for all in the form of a giant nuke to the kaijus passage to our world, the Breach. Raleigh begins by finding his co pilot in the form of Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) who, much like Raleigh, has quite a troubled past. Together they must link there minds in something called a drift in which they share there memories with one another in order to gain control of their jaeger, Gypsy Danger, an old Jaeger once piloted by Raleigh and his brother Yancy before its destruction. <br/><br/>But the main attraction of this movie is the giant building crushing, plasma blasting, earth shaking battles between the Kaiju and the Jaeger. The visuals in this movie are gorgeous, unfortunately i was unable to see this film in 3D. But, with or without 3D the battles in this movie are breathtaking. The kaiju are truly terrifying and each one is different than the last. The Jaeger are also quite astounding, the main jaeger that are shown in this film are Gypsy Danger, piloted by Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori. Stryker Eureka, piloted by Herc Hansen (Max Martini) and his son Chuck (Robert Kazinsky). Crimson Typhoon, piloted by the Wei Tang triplets (Charles, Lance, and Mark Luu). And Cherno Alpha, piloted by the Kaidanovsky's (Robert Maillet and Heather Doerksen). <br/><br/>There's also the matter of Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) a scientist obsessed with the kaiju, and his counterpart Gottlieb (Burn Gorman). Geiszler believes that if he is allowed to use the technology the jaeger pilots use to drift with each other, he will be able to drift with a piece of a kaijus brain. He attempts this process and nearly kills himself but learns that the kaiju are merely the extermination team sent to destroy the human population so there masters may take over the planet, when Pentecoast hears about this, he asks Gieszler to drift with another kaiju brain, which gieszler does not possess. Stacker then sends him to find Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) a black market dealer for Kaiju parts and get another kaiju brain. Geiszler and Gottlieb then continue to drift with the kaiju brain and find out the only way to get through the breach is to somehow trick the breach into thinking whatever is passing through is a kaiju. <br/><br/>In a last ditch effort the two remaining jaeger, Gypsy Danger and Stryker Eureka, now piloted by Chuck Hansen and Stacker Pentecoast, head under water towards the breach where they are attacked by two category 4 kaiju. During this battle Gypsy Danger is damaged severely but manages to kill one of the kaiju, as Stryker Eureka approaches the breach with the nuke on its back, a category 5 kaiju emerges, the largest kaiju ever on record. Realizing they have no chance Chuck and Stacker decide to detonate the nuke to clear a path for Gypsy Danger to enter the breach and detonate its nuclear core. After the nuke is detonated Gypsy heads towards the breach only to be stopped by the category 5 kaiju who is then tackled, stabbed, and burned by Gypsy Danger who proceeds to take the kaiju body through the breach in order to pass through. Once on the other side Raleigh, realizing Mako does not have much oxygen left, gives her his oxygen and sends her back in an escape pod. Raleigh then detonates Gypsy Dangers core and enters his own escape, barely making it through the breach before Gypsy explodes and destroys it. Mako and Raleigh then exit there escape pods and embrace each other, realizing the kaiju war is finally over. <br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie yet, I would suggest you head to the nearest theater ASAP and watch this fantastic piece of art. Truly the best film of the year."

","Seeing this maybe one of the most fun times I've ever had watching anything. Made with an obvious and beautifully apparent love for movie-making and entertainment, this film kicks down the door and strides onto the screen with such bravado and comfort in its substance and nature that I can see no way to dislike it. Yes, the plot is goddamn ridiculous at times. Yes, it's a little over-the-top at times. But you know what? That's beautiful. And we need more of that in our lives. A little unburdened fun is something we all could use, and this film delivers heaps upon heaps of unburdened fun. Let us not forget, though, that it is not all giant-robots-punching- giant-aliens in every scene (welcome though those incredible scenes are). No, this film is just as much story and characters than it is style and action. The identities of the main characters in this film are some of the most appropriately portrayed I have seen from the action/sci-fi genre in a long time. It's not a character drama, so not too much must be read into and there isn't too much weight or seriousness to the more calm parts of the story, creating a few meaningful plot points, which is perfectly enough to satisfy even the viewer who is suspicious of massive films like this lacking any plot whatsoever (and I have been accused of being one of these). I can't say exactly how I felt when it finished, but I was content with its conclusion, (though it was a tad sudden), and I was delighted that I'd taken in this film. Mr. Del Toro, you're a masterful entertainer and filmmaker, and thank you for creating a film that can stand up, be confident in its massive substance, and strive to entertain and create a good time. Because above all else, if you still need a reason to see it, Pacific Rim can guarantee a real goddamn good time at the movies."

","If you're an animé fan (Japanese animation), then this is the movie for you!<br/><br/>I came to the movie theater with a mindset that I am a kid again -- ready to fight Ultraman-Evangelion-Samurai X style -- something like that. Although, I am actually a kid in an adult's body. LOL.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed with this movie. The movie was honest. It did not feel forced like the Transformers movies. I've seen del Toro's past work, e.g. Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy movies. I liked those movies of his, and especially this new one. It was big! Big concept with big action sequences -- and it delivered! <br/><br/>This movie would make you wish you've seen it when you were in elementary! Prepare for some Ultraman-Gundam-Godzilla nostalgia!<br/><br/>I hope Pacific Rim succeeds in the box office. It's a big, ambitious, original movie which pays tribute to the classic anime/comic book greats. Hollywood is currently obsessed with DC/Marvel superhero movies. We need more original movies like this that does not have Batman, Spider-man, or Iron Man in it's title as it's selling point.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro deserves some huge credit!<br/><br/>10/10"
"bugus92","9","2","8","12 July 2013"," Putting Transformers to shame
","Transformers was an amazing movie. When it first came out, it was a blockbuster movie. Everyone was talking about it, everyone bought the toys, everyone couldn't wait for a sequel.<br/><br/>For quite some time, Transformers was left unchallenged. I mean really, that movie has a cult following. To challenge it would be stupid. Or is it?<br/><br/>Pacific Rim proves that Transformers does not monopolize the giant robot/action/CGI movie industry. When I first watched it, I noticed two things: (1) The storyline was very predictable (2) I didn't care about '(1)', because most of time my face looked like this -> =O or =D<br/><br/>Transformers had the wow factor, but it is a kid's movie compared to Pacific Rim. But the main reason I'd rate this movie 9 stars is because it brought the whole ""Godzilla"" and ""King Kong"" monster movies back in to limelight. They made evil mindless giants destroying cities cool again.<br/><br/>Whats even better, this time, we fight back with giants of our own. If you're like me, you've played games like ""Mech Warrior"" or ""Gears of War"", then you will definitely love this movie. The giant robots are controlled by humans, like the giant robots in ""Power Rangers"" but 1000 times cooler.<br/><br/>In my opinion however, the main selling point of this movie is the fact that Guillermo del Toro really stretched the limits of his imagination this time, fusing the Eastern ""Godzilla"" with the Western ""King Kong"" and adding a pinch of ""Alien"", creating his ""Kaiju"". He reflects these monsters with the robots too,creating ""Jaegers"". The wow factor in this movie is definitely that, combined with the amazing graphics. The tacky lines like the part where Mako Mori says ""For my family!"" before slashing the Kaiju or the part where Raleigh says ""We're out of options"" when they had a blade they didn't use until halfway through the movie, may make you frown a little when watching it. But that's all it does. You just frown. A little. You're still going to enjoy the movie, it really doesn't change anything.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie is definitely going to be a classic. It doesn't matter what you may think, it's a movie that people will watch again and again, just to watch some robots beat the crap out of monsters. It is in the same league as the legendary ""Godzilla"" and ""King Kong"", and Guillermo del Toro is indeed deserving of awards (which I am sure he will get) for creating such a masterpiece.<br/><br/>He has indeed, done it again."

","After seeing pacific rim I have to say the visual effects were stunning, Idris Elba was awesome as he portrayed the steel plated commander 'Staker Pentecost' and was as strong and temperamental as he is in 'Luther'. The acting overall was up to scratch from the whole cast in particular Charlie Day as 'Dr. Newton Geiszler certainly offered the audience some comic relief from all the action.

"supernma","8","2","8","12 July 2013"," Humanity is not lost among the eye candy
","""Pacific Rim"" is the latest creation from Spanish visionary Guillermo del Toro (director of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and the ""Hellboy"" movies). The film tells the story of the pilots of giant robotic machines called Jaegers who must go head to head with invading, sky-scraping beasts called Kaiju, making for some of the most jaw-dropping showdowns in recent cinema. And while the film's greatest achievement is its astounding visual effects, the human element is never lost in the mix.<br/><br/>The film is told from the human perspective, making for some true edge-of-your-seat entertainment as the pilots are shaken and tossed around in the head of the Jaegers, adding suspense and jeopardy to scenes mostly rendered in a computer - in the hands of a lesser director, the fight scenes could easily be detached and cartoonish, but del Toro allows the audience to stay with the pilots and control centers, giving these extended battle royales genuine gravitas.<br/><br/>The acting is well-done and each of the protagonists is given a back story and good motivations, but it is Idris Elba who delivers a standout performance as the commander of the Jaeger program. While our main hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, is given a decent character arc and background, he isn't fleshed out as well as Elba's or even Rinko Kikuchi's character, so you don't necessarily care about him as much as the other two protagonists.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Pacific Rim"" is a feast for the eyes with human drama added for good measure. The main draw of the film is obviously the clash of the titans element, but audiences will also be able to connect to the characters, enriching those moments of ocean-moving, building-tumbling collisions as two beasts, one from another world, one man-made, pummel each other to the death."

On the contrary, I would have little trouble believing this was actual footage. The water looked fantastic, metal glistened beautifully, and the monsters were actually kind of scary.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, an action film should be entertaining, and Pacific Rim did that better than I've seen in a long time. No sex, no plot twists, no leaps of logic, just suspension of disbelief. This is no Bergman work, and Del Toro didn't try to make a mental labyrinth. Take this film at face value for what it is: A beautifully done film with fantastic special effects that only aims to entertain.

","This movie was beyond what I thought it was going to be. It was purely amazing! The way the effects looked and the humor, it was perfect. What I loved most about this movie, was that they created a brand new type of alien. Giant ones! Ones that stray away from your normal looking ones, these were MONSTERS. They were cool, and very much realistic. The idea that they come from under the sea of the pacific and come threw a portal they built is genius. The characters did a fantastic job and the story was very much believable. The special effects were great! One thing I love about futuristic movies is the technology that comes with it. And this one was perfect. Just the idea of such big monsters roaming around is awesome and really makes you think about the large scale of these alien creatures. <br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like about my experience watching it, (and maybe it was just the theater I was in), but I found it to be VERY LOUD. So loud that when I left the theater, I felt like I had just gotten out of a concert. But other than that, it was a really good movie.

","Pacific Rim is a movie that knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers because everything put to screen is executed wonderfully. The performances are spot on and the actors really do make you care for the characters even with very little development or exposition. I liked the fact that the movie is its own sequel. Meaning, they cut through all the origin and set up of this world in the first 15 minutes. It's like a built in fast forward button. As it was unfolding, I kept thinking to myself that they are skipping over some pretty big and important stuff. Stuff we'd like to see and maybe should have seen. Yet, that wasn't really the case because what was left perfectly fit the story and certainly delivered the monster VS giant robot action everyone paid to see. The monsters are truly frightening and the CGI very well done. This film's budget has made news but at least it felt like they spent everything on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very fun trip to the cinema."

","This movie is awful. The giant robot vs monster fights are Transformer style, often too close in to see what's happening. The human plots are half baked. The acting is bad.<br/><br/>If they had focused on the overall giant robots vs monsters action and one human plot, it would have been much better. But with all the sub plots crammed in, and with the movie starting near the end of the story, the movie ends up a bad drama and a bad monster movie.<br/><br/>The giant monsters are pretty boring. The robots are pretty boring.<br/><br/>It even seems like the director/writer couldn't keep their own story straight. They make a big deal of left and right - one pilot controlling one side while the other controls the other side. But then, in the action scenes, both pilots move their control arm to move one robot arm.<br/><br/>It doesn't make sense the way the monsters destroy some robots, but can't do the same to others.

I could imagine everyone who worked on the film saying, ""You didn't come here for memorable characters or a good plot. You just came here to see giant robots fight giant monsters."" It's true that the robots and monsters are what I watched the movie for (and the special effects are good, which is why I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of 1) but I also expected an adequate story to prop up the special effects. Independence Day might be a dumb action movie but I enjoyed it because it explained the villains' motivations decently and there were some memorable performances from Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman. The characters in Pacific Rim are incredibly bland and some of the plot points are just a bit too stupid (like the giant wall and the robot sword that the characters apparently forget about for most of the movie). I was hoping to enjoy Pacific Rim, because I thought the concept was interesting but it could have been better written. Apparently it's getting a sequel, despite only barely making twice its budget. (Movies have to make a substantial amount more than twice their productions budgets because the studios have to share the total revenue with theaters, isn't that right?) Maybe that will be better."
"pureziva","2","1","3","2 November 2015"," d-
","i wanted to love this movie, but was disappointed as many other reviewers were. however, it's important to note that not every movie will be a masterpiece and that's okay. there were a lot of plays performed before films, but try to name anyone other than homer or Shakespeare who wrote anything. it's basically the same issue today. that's not to say that formulaic movies are a terrible thing, but i felt that this did not even follow it's own formula. things just happened that did not naturally lead to the other, and i did not connect with the characters although the actors were good with what they had to work with. rather than just complain for the sake of it, here are some ideas for how it could have been improved: the death of the brother should have been way more suspenseful and meaningful. it just kinda happened and then did not really add anything to the story. it's not like it added an element of danger to the kaiju, because it happened too quick to be emotionally engaging. raleigh should have used that experience to want to fight those kaiju and seek revenge or something, but it barely got mentioned beyond the beginning.<br/><br/>-they could have dropped the entire plot of them trying to get rid of the jaeger program, and raleigh did not need to be working on the wall and convinced to come back. i did not feel any suspense about that and it totally did not add anything to the story. maybe instead, he could have been in a coma for that 5 years after the big fight, and come back to see everything changed etc. if you did want the government shutdown to be a big deal, make it worse: significant characters die because there's no jaegers to fight kaiju, they have to rebel and sneak the jaegers out, etc. the kaiju danger definitely should have been drawn out and dramatized more. it just seemed like ""the kaiju are bad, now they're really bad, now they're really really bad."" without adding any real depth to the antagonistic forces, simply multiplying numbers doesn't make the audience care.<br/><br/>-for that matter, and maybe i missed this which again shows how poorly plotted this was, what did the kaiju even want? why were they here in the first place, and why wasn't that dramatized more? if kaiju are your villain, i should definitely know what their goal is, but they just kinda showed up. even the jaws shark seemed like he had a twisted sadism, so i'm not asking for shakespearean villains. it just seemed really random and it would have been cool if they needed something from our world or something.<br/><br/>-if you have a $190 million budget, please don't make the fights in the dark where i can barely see what is happening. it looked so cool but it was way too fast and dark for me to tell who was fighting who. i mean at least have different color schemes so the jaegers and the kaiju contrast. but if you make 1 dark blue and 1 dark green and have them fight at 2 am in the mist, i'm frustrated and bored because i can't see. i feel like they probably wanted it to ""look different"" than other similar movies like transformers, and so they darkened it to the detriment of the film.<br/><br/>the neural drifting concept was super cool, but i feel it wasn't nearly developed enough. there should have been a major obstacle due to something sinister in the raleigh or mako (his partner)'s subecauseonscious mind or something, beyond the minor vignette where you see her family was killed by kaiju as a kid. that should have contributed to some type of character development as it relates to the current story, not just dumb back story.<br/><br/>-the selfless actions of the characters at the end were meaningless because they were never selfish at the beginning, so they did not learn anything or go through an arc. there literally was no hero's journey because he was basically heroic at the beginning. what's the point of that? overall i just found it odd i was so bored.<br/><br/>this movie had so much potential. it wasn't horrible, i just feel like they could have done way better."
"james1080-272-547223","9","1","3","15 May 2015"," Biggest Monster Movie Ever
","""To fight monsters, we created monsters of our own"" This movie is huge, unlike anything I've ever seen before and it genuinely is a monster of a movie, and exactly as Charlie Day's character puts it ""2500 tonnes of awesome"". In the first fifteen minutes I was concerned, I felt it came across extremely childish but once the Gypsy Danger crashed onto the beach after a failed mission I knew Del Toro would start bringing in the excellent back-stories and a sense of threat. <br/><br/>I'm not going to dive into the characters too much as I feel they are all so richly constructed it's worth watching it and getting connected to them yourself, but I will say the cast are brilliant. Charlie Hunnam is a top lead and a believable hero, Idris Elba nailed the role of Commanding Officer Stacker Pentecost by delivering true authority. Rinko Kikuchi makes you feel the pain extremely well as Mako Mori, a Jaeger pilot who lost her family in the wake of the Kaiju, Mori's strength and fury comes out whenever she pilots the metal beasts. My only issue is with Charlie Day who seems to be stuck in Horrible Bosses mode, constantly whining and raising his voice whenever he gets the chance, although his co-star Burn Gorman does a great job of bringing you back to reality amongst the colossal fighting that goes on. <br/><br/>The 3D is the best of 2013, this movie focuses more on depth and boy it delivers. From the get go you know you are in for a treat, check out the shot of the Kaiju trashing the bridge, it looks so close but the cars at the front separating the distance beautifully. Cars, building blocks, well actually everything comes close to exiting the screen but you are more a less immersed into the action. Underwater looks incredible as corals and rocks take on pointy surfaces, it all looks stunning. The reference moment is the harbour fight between Gyspy and the acid spitting monster, the 3D is the best I've ever seen at this moment, whole crates and containers whizz around the screen, depth is evident even in split second camera shots, it is groundbreaking in visuals and will no doubt leave you in awe, I totally geeked out and kept shouting at the screen yelling ""COME ON!"". The sound is the best to hit home cinema systems, every thud, knockout punch, Kaiju roar and splashing waves screams, it is cinematic in definition and in my opinion, better than Transformers, which is a lot coming from me as I'm a huge fan of those movies. You must own this release. <br/><br/>As for the special effects they are awe-inspiring on a grand scale, whole cities are wiped out as Jaegers and Kaiju's leave a path of destruction whilst fighting with extreme power. I love the rain effects that dominate the action scenes, and the majority of the movie is set in the dark so the neon lights of Hong Kong look gorgeous against the backdrop of the carnage. My favourite scene though wasn't a fight, it was the scene where young Mako Mori is running away in terror from a Kaiju, every single camera shot here is excellent and the fear in the young girl's face is frightening, this scene hits hard. This is as big as Godzilla, as destructive and chaotic as Transformers but it has the most heart and depth than both those two which is a bonus, and although it does make you wait for spectacle the payoff is truly breathtaking. I highly recommend this beast of a movie, it's a visual marvel all over and it's bolstered down by wonderful characters."

","I wanted to like this movie but couldn't. How it rates a 7.0 I do not know. Even the worst Godzilla movie is better than this one. This movie is good for a one time rental but I would not want to own it. The acting is terrible, the CG monster action is too much in your face and not very realistic. This movie was made for teenage boys and nothing else. Everything is macho. Macho actors, macho monsters, macho robots. The only thing not macho was the script. Sorry, the new Godzilla 2014 movie is 100 times better. I'm glad the director did not have the time to direct the Godzilla movie. I am a life long monster movie fan from back in the 30's until present time and so I know what makes a good monster movie and Pacific Rim is not it. When Pacific Rim 2 comes out I will not be lining up to see it at the movies and will not be renting it on DVD."

Women are allocated one tear; men, none. It makes Fast and Furious look like Shakespeare. The usual Hollywood ""blockbuster"", no thinking required: too much unintelligible, contrived blabbering, cardboard cartoon characters, long on eye candy; short on unimportant things like plot and character development.

"DarthVoorhees","6","1","3","8 June 2014"," Del Torro is a talented imagining dreamer but a flawed storyteller...
","I love Guillermo Del Torro and I want to start the review by saying that because a lot of what I am going to write here is going to sound like brash criticism. Del Torro is a brilliant filmmaker. He is one of the most imaginative visual storytellers of recent years and for that he most be given his due praise. As much as a I love Del Torro though as a director and imaginer I have to admit his flaws as a screenwriter and a storyteller. 'Pacific Rim' looks amazing and has intense thrills but when the movie isn't showcasing it's monsters it's showcasing Del Torro's terrible insight into creating characters. 'Pacific Rim' is a ride but it is a cartoon.<br/><br/>In general I've pretty much always felt this way about Del Torro. I think the man can stage an action sequence as good as anybody. 'Pacific Rim' might be his masterpiece if this is all you are concerned with. Del Torro is able to do what a J.J Abrams and a Michael Bay can't, show epic size and scope with perspective. I can actually tell who is fighting who and that sadly is great praise. Del Torro doesn't just throw a bunch of stuff at the screen in the hopes that some of it will stick. He makes deliberate choices and a lot of these choices work. 'Pacific Rim' feels epic in the best sense of the word. There is a build up in the thrills and the final battle in the actual 'Rim' hits a high crescendo of pulp fun.<br/><br/>Del Torro's other great strength is his imagination. The universe of 'Pacific Rim' is so much fun. The first ten or fifteen minutes is nothing but exposition and yet I wasn't bored. If anything this is the most interesting and fun part of the movie. I love finding out about these jaegers and how the government came to defend us from the horrific giant monsters. It's like HP Lovecraft on acid in a Toho film and I was throughly entertained. I think I like these moments best because Del Torro is going into his strongest talent, imagining concepts. When the film has to be populated with characters well...<br/><br/>'Pacific Rim' on it's smallest and more personal level feels like every action cliché rolled into a super package. Del Torro's grasp on dialogue and plot feels as if he has only read the basest of comic books and action films. Charlie Hunnam is a talented actor but this character is so boring. He is merely just a hero. Our female lead Mako Mori played by Rinko Kikuchi is a nightmarish stereotype in my humble opinion. She doesn't do anything with the character and is only there to fit the stereotypes of Asian characters in these kind of science fiction films. She is fragile and that fragility is so false and only there so big strong Raleigh can win her. Of course she can also do karate with the best of them. These characters are the fantasy of a ten year old boy. That isn't to say that they can't be entertaining. Charlie Day and Burn Gorham are fun in the film because they recognize that they should not play this straight. Ron Perlman continues to be Del Torro's luck charm because I think he realizes that Del Torro is all about big choices. <br/><br/>Big choices can make a film like this very good but it is the smaller personal choices made by characters that make a film like this great."

","I am voting 3 because the action scenes are worth a good credit but the rest of the movie drags the overall rating down. And that is it.

Just bad.

","Sometimes when you have a lot of faith in a director, gives a little sorry not qualify you positively, especially when the film has an added value of common productions, but when we see the whole picture, we notice that William made a kind of remake of Independence Day in 1996 with monsters. Instead of a spacecraft have a dimensional portal at a time to see Dr. Newton doing psychic connection with the invaders where he learns that invade worlds, being the ""housekeeping"". We have the hopeless who sacrifices to the enemy that caused their illness, bringing the nuclear bomb that destroyed the command center of the enemy. To access the portal and the mother ship, we have to use a ship or genetic signature Kaiju, extraterrestrial scene watching the atomic bomb that ends the invasion is very similar. The end where the two heroes are rescued. Not to ignore the problems of logic that many of the explanations given by scientists, I mean, there are no alien enemy which has a constant blanks, it should be known all theorizing and things like that are part of an invasion, but that's a subject for another debate. In the graphic is more than outstanding, monster battles are well choreographed with a riot of special effects where it has been most of the budget not spent in familiar faces. While the story has many flaws, is a film that fulfills its role as an entertaining adventure unpretentious, but by no means neglects the void that could be filled with a better script, without any explanations on unnecessary parts."
"triarii85","9","1","3","16 May 2014"," This movie has a lot of problems
","I had a lot of problems with this movie. This movie is much more focused on the human characters, and less focused on monster fighting action. I would not have a problem with that at all, but if you are going to have a character driven story, you need to actually DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTERS. <br/><br/>Characters need an arc, they need to be fleshed out and actually grow through the movie, so that we as an audience grow with them and care about them. In this movie, the characters are just cardboard cutouts, none of them are any different at the end than they are at the beginning. <br/><br/>Pacific Rim, a movie which this is obviously compared to, is widely criticized for its lame story and characters. But the characters in Pacific Rim actually are developed and fleshed out, even if the developments are cliché. Mako overcomes her childhood fears, Raliegh overcomes his brother's death, the scientists who are normally adversarial start to work together, etc. The developments were mostly shallow, but the characters were not the focus of the movie, the focus was the action between the robots and kaiju.<br/><br/>In what ways does any character in Godzilla actually grow? Ford thought his dad was crazy, but found out he wasn't... OK. He loves his family and wants to get home. eventually he does... great. Olsen's character loves her husband and son, good for her. The only one having anything approaching a character arc is Cranston's character, but that ends quickly. Do any of these characters learn anything or grow emotionally through out the story? I didn't see it. If you are going to do a character driven drama, you need to actually have real characters. And since they didn't all we have is a 2 hour long movie with about 15 minutes of anything interesting happening."
"murtaza_mma","8","1","3","20 April 2014"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi extravaganza
","A futuristic film set in the 2020s, Pacific Rim presents the final chapter in the devastating war between humankind and an alien race of monstrous sea creatures called ""Kaiju"" which emerged from deep beneath the Pacific Ocean through a fissure between two tectonic plates, an inter-dimensional portal termed as ""The Breach"". The human race, in a bid to fight these monsters, is forced to create monsters of its own known as ""Jaegers""—gigantic humanoid robots controlled by two human pilots, whose minds are connected by a neural bridge capable of establishing a psychic intimacy through a phenomenon called ""The Drift"".<br/><br/>Doesn't the story sound familiar? Well, you bet! Apparently, the plots of almost all modern sci-fi films, especially those spawned by Hollywood, seem to revolve around the very same context. The aliens are on the charge and the bravest amongst our race must rise to the occasion and put their lives on the line in order to save the world from an impending apocalypse. And, invariably, the only aspect that differentiates it from the other films of its kind is its visual appeal. How grand is the use of CGI and VFX is all that matters. For, these films are all style with very little substance. On the face of it, Pacific Rim appears to be no different. In fact, with regards to its visual makeup, Pacific Rim comes across as another perfect summer blockbuster made in the vein of Transformers or Iron Man films. Honestly speaking, after seeing the movie's rushes, I was more or less convinced that Pacific Rim was just another ostentatious, run-of-the-mill Hollywood product in the making.<br/><br/>But, Guillermo del Toro never ceases to amaze with his genius! Pacific Rim is not merely a visual spectacle but it's also a film that can be deemed a consummate cinematic product: a great deal of attention is given to character development, the narrative works well on the emotional level, and occasional bursts of humour ensure that the tension gets punctuated every now and then. Pacific Rim reminds me of another very well made sci-fi film that seemed to perfectly blend flamboyance with substance: Neill Blomkamp's brilliant District 9 (2009). But, make no mistake! The content of Pacific Rim is far from being original. In fact, the film seems to borrow a lot from classic sci-fi films. Thus, it wouldn't be wrong to look upon Pacific Rim as del Toro's homage to classic films like Star Wars, Independence Day, Godzilla, Avatar, and Transformers.<br/><br/>Overall, Pacific Rim comes across as an extremely well made sci-fi, action-adventure extravaganza. Its breathtaking, sumptuous visual graphics clubbed with a strong emotional quotient make it one of a kind. No one but Guillermo del Toro could have handled a seemingly commonplace plot with such delicacy, ingeniously transforming it into an end product that's not only richer but also smarter than the rest. While the acting is solid all around, the cinematography, editing and music are all, without a shadow of a doubt, topnotch. It's quite shocking that del Toro's film went completely unnoticed at all the major award functions, barring a single BAFTA nomination for Best Special Visual Effects. Pacific Rim offers truckloads of entertainment and keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat, throughout its runtime. It's a heady cocktail of style and substance that packs a powerful punch. 8/10<br/><br/>A more in-depth review can be read at:<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"info-11400","6","1","3","1 February 2014"," American Anime
","Pacific Rim is nothing else but an American version of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The setting, the cities, even the wording (Kaiju, Jäger) point in that direction. <br/><br/>Monster-Techno-Anime as a real movie, in 3D. Fantastic. <br/><br/>However... The movie turns out to be an empty shell. The visuals are great, the general storyline is just fine. Japanese anime have this fantastic settings too, but they have the tendency to concentrate on the psychology and philosophy of the characters (see Neon Genesis Evangelion, Blue Submarine No 9, Akira, Ghost in the shell for example) This adds enormous depth too the films. Yes, I know, it sounds strange. But the Japanese demonstrate and proof that even a monster movie needs some depth. <br/><br/>This is missing in Pacific Rim. Only in the scenes with young Mako you get a sense of this. And these are actually the only moments where one gets any idea about the motivation of the characters. <br/><br/>So, in the end, I watched this beautiful looking movie, and constantly missed something more than just plain heroism. And hardly ever there was more. <br/><br/>Nice movie for fans, but not a good one."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","1","3","3 January 2014"," Power Rangers vs Godzilla
","I'm not a fan of brainless movies. There are very few exceptions and I decided to give Pacific Rim a chance since it was made by an apparently desperate for work Guillermo del Toro playing well outside his comfort zone. His familiar insectoid imagery is briefly present, but for the most part this is new, and unsuitable, ground for him. I understand that he just had to get a big movie done after leaving the Hobbit and so many false starts for his adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness (a film that doesn't really need to exist as John Carpenter's The Thing is about as close as you can get to it) though Pacific Rim was the wrong script to choose.<br/><br/>Set in the near future a portal between our universe and a universe filled with giant monsters opens up beneath the ocean and said monsters barge through and cause mass destruction. Yup, it's yet more 9/11 porn, a sub-genre that was already tiresome and overdone before this movie even came out.<br/><br/>In order to fight the monsters the world government builds giant mechs to dish out a good old clobbering, sometimes with the help of a handy container ship just sitting nearby. The mechs are piloted mainly by twins or by close siblings who can symbiotically fight back using opposite hemispheres of the brain. As expected there is conflict between the pilots and disrespect for authority in between smash-ups.<br/><br/>The actors are mainly cursory as without them the movie would be entirely CGI. The Japanese chick is hot, but Charlie Hunnam is neither good nor terrible, and I really don't understand the hype built around Idris Elba. The only ones I liked were Ron Perlman's black market dealer and Charlie Day as the excitable scientist.<br/><br/>At 131 minutes the movie is overlong and there are a few small scenes that could have snipped. With a careless $190 million dollar budget Pacific Rim was lucky to not bomb as bad a predicted. This really, really is not intelligent sci-fi. It's braindead, candy-colored mayhem for angry teens with ADHD. I am so surprised that del Toro would make a movie like this, the material is beneath him."

I could not help but sing ""Voltron Voltron Voltron!"" in my head.<br/><br/>The acting was, well, at times horrendous. The lead character was played horribly, and this was not just due to a bad script. Idris Elba did what he could with the script. Some other characters, like the scientists and the black market guy, are similarly well acted as the cold, predictable script allows. The female character was so horribly developed, so weak, such a drag, such a liability to all the good guys, that no matter what the actress did, I don't think I would have liked her.<br/><br/>All in all, a good time waster, but there are better, more fun time wasters out there.

"mgruebel","5","1","3","21 December 2013"," Godzilla movies are back - a little too long
","The bottom line: a passable remake of ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"", a camp and fun Japanese production that invented city-bashing monsters fighting giant human-controlled robots. One thing Guillermo del Toro does not understand as well as the Toho gang: under 90 minutes, baby!<br/><br/>Still, with del Toro at the helm, it can't be too bad, and indeed, he delivers expert direction, yet somehow it feels as though he must have been bored while making the film: Perhaps the unnecessary pauses between robot-monster action? The cardboard characters filling said pauses?<br/><br/>The movie borrows liberally from the toolbox of action/horror/sf: We have the well-known actor who gets killed unexpectedly by the monster halfway through the movie (done better in ""Deep Blue Sea,"" and invented by Alfred Hitchcock for ""Psycho"", and in both of those films it was actually unexpected, but not here). The demure Japanese girl motivated by a strong father figure (straight from ""G vs. MG""). We have the rookie who gets no respect, two types of mad scientist, the stern commander whose authority is continually questioned by the hero. Etc, etc. It also is filled with inconsistencies: Let's build a steel-and-concrete wall to hold off monsters that break through skyscrapers as through they were cardboard, and abandon a fairly successful robot defense program. The stern commander realizes a piece of the monster is critical for the mission, but sends a lone chief scientist without ID to pick it up from a dangerous criminal who has government leave to harvest monster pieces. Wait, let's fight the monsters with swords, instead of burying hardened nuclear weapons near the rift and detonating one each time a monster comes out (we did real-life underwater nuke tests for years in the Pacific, and the fallout is much less than having whole cities eaten up). Speaking of swords, the monsters can be sliced into half by a sword, but they can crush through a skyscraper without visible injury, what with all those sharp steel beams poking out. Etc etc.<br/><br/>Now to the good side: for the genre, it is expertly executed, if a little overlong. It delivers almost non-stop anime-style Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla fun, and with all due respect to the Japanese model builders of decades ago, CGI allows better interaction of monster and cityscape. The hero and heroine act together professionally, and only in one line of dialog does the writer/director team break down and go for the superfluous romance angle. The mad scientists are so overacted that it's actually good fun. And Ron Perlman gets a fun cameo, despite his overly obvious declamations before his demise.<br/><br/>The movie does not rise in any way above the limitations of the genre (the way ""Deep Blue Sea"" did), but it does hold the attention for about 90 minutes of its two hours and goes well with pop corn."
"Uriah43","5","1","3","21 December 2013"," CGI and Action
","In the near future, dinosaur-like monsters come from beneath the Pacific Ocean and obliterate several cities on the coast. San Francisco is one of the first. These huge monsters are given the name ""Kaijus"" and current military weaponry is insufficient to contain them. So the nations of the world join forces and create huge manned robots called ""Jaegers"" which initially have great success against them. However, the Kaijus adapt and become more powerful and more numerous. As the Jaegers become more obsolescent a new plan is formulated which halts production of them in favor of the creation of huge walls upon the coasts of all nations. But the idea is a tremendous failure and the world is left with only a few remaining Jaegers to combat more frequent and powerful Kaijus. Now, rather than disclose the entire plot and risk spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it, allow me to just say that fans of CGI and action will probably love this film as it has elements of both in copious amounts. Likewise, it also has an incredibly beautiful heroine named ""Mako Mori"" (Rinko Kikuchi) to add to the scenery as well. Unfortunately, because of all of the attention to these special effects it seemed that everything else was secondary. What you see is what you get--CGI and action. That said, although I liked it to an extent, I would have definitely preferred more drama and suspense in place of some of the high octane action. It would have made the film a bit less tedious. As such I give this movie an average rating."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","1","3","19 December 2013"," A very good sci-fi/action film which had much more depth to it than I originally thought
","Pacific Rim came as a pleasant surprise to me as I went in with expectations of a mindless, but enjoyable action film. What surprised me is that PR wasn't just an enjoyable film with plenty of action, but the story was also much better than I expected.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes are basically a narrative by Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam) who explains the uprising of the Kenjiu - giant beasts that rise from the sea who will destroy anyone or anything that stands in their way. In order to counter the problem, large robots known as 'Jaegers' have been constructed and each Jaeger is operated by 2 pilots. When a Kaiju attack occurs in Alaska, 2 pilots Raleigh and Yancy (who are brothers)are sent out to contain the Kaiju attack. However, when the Jaeger fail to prevent the Kajiu attack (which sadly resulted in Yancy's death), Raleigh's marshal Stacker Pentecost is told by the government that they no longer want his team to use Jaegers and tell Pentecost that they want a wall building to keep the Kajiu out. When the wall becomes breached, Pentecost recruits Raleigh and asks him to accompany him to the Jaeger station in Hong Kong to try and destroy the Kajiu once and for all.<br/><br/>The interesting aspect with this is that both pilots have to be emotionally similar in order to operate the 'Jaegers' effectively - this automatically allows the audience to really get into the characters and feel each of their emotions. This point becomes most prevalent in an emotive and tense scene between Raleigh and his new co-pilot Mako when they both share a 'mind melt' in the Jaeger. This also gives Guillermo Del Toro an opportunity to really show off his directional flair - check out the drift sequences and the mind melt sequences as they really are a feast for the eyes. This helps to give depth to a great array of characters.<br/><br/>Next thing that is great are the visuals - the cinematography & special effects for PR are simply mind blowing. Of course, gorgeous visuals & excellent cinematography alone are not enough to carry a film. This is the style aspect of filmmaking. In order for film's of this nature to work they must also have the 'substance' element - compelling story and fleshed out characters. For me, this is why PR works as it balances the 2 elements perfectly. Many films of this nature focus way too much on action to try to cover up a weak story, but PR spends a lot of time developing the story whilst still containing plenty of action to keep fans of the genre happy. Credit for balancing both aspects clearly need to go to writer Travis Beacham and director Guillermo Del Toro.<br/><br/>Whilst there is plenty to praise PR about, there were a couple of minor niggles I had with the film; the dialogue at times was a bit cheesy, there were occasions when the camera work was a bit sloppy (particularly towards the beginning). Also the characters of Newt and Gottlieb whilst being relevant to the overall story, it's quite clear that they were introduced to provide some kind of comic relief, but to me they came off as a really bad 'double act'. I found their characters more annoying than anything else.<br/><br/>That being said, these niggles were very minor and did not stop me from enjoying Pacific Rim. I found it captivating from start to finish and was really pleased that the writers have created more than just a mindless action flick."

They just make you want to question the crew, e.g. why not use swords straight away. Forget the blood theories, the ease of using a sword makes complete sense when punching and pummelling a kaiju causes property destruction and increased chances of death for pilots.<br/><br/>Aside from that and some ordinary acting in parts it's a fun film.

Before I start I will say that I was not looking forward to seeing this at all. I am a sci-fi fan but this looked slow and boring. That said I will say this was pretty much what I expected.

First, the film is dark all the time, with grayish tint throughout. I got so tired of the monochromatic stimulation. More colour could easily be provided, such as changing the colour of the wall in the base camp. Second, the plot is just not engaging or exciting. There were several occasions when I thought the film was ending, but it continued. And dragged on. The film just did not know when to stop. The plot does not build up to an effective climax either. That motivational speech by Idris Elba ended up being laughable.<br/><br/>Another thing that really killed my enjoyment was the bunker scene in Hong Kong. Despite the film being set in the 2020's, people in the bunker wore clothes in the 1920s. And they even spoke in Mandarin, which is not spoken in Hong Kong. The director sacrificed such important factual errors for cinematic clichés. And while I am on clichés, the first scene with Chinese people in the Hong Kong base shows the people from China playing basketball. My eyes rolled so much when I saw that scene!

The downside is many of them don't seem overly excited to be here just to spout some of the worst dialogue of the year.<br/><br/>The basic story is a war between mankind and the Kaiju - monsters from another world. World leaders work together to develop the Jaeger program ... robots co-piloted by two people who are drift compatible (a kind of mind meld that let's them fight as one). After years of struggling against the Kaiju, the world leaders decide instead to build a security wall around the main cities. Clearly they had not seen World War Z or read any of the ""fence"" stories from the US/Mexico border. No surprise, but the robots have to be reactivated for the climactic battle scene.<br/><br/>Iris Elba runs the Jaeger program and commands the pilots that include Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi, Max Martini, and Robert Kazinski. Hunnam is battling inner demons after the death of his brother (Diego Klattenhoff). For some reason, Hunnam plays his part with an overdose of bland. He seems to have been cast for his effectiveness in his shirtless scenes. Martini and Kazinski stand out here, probably because competition is so uninspired, oh and they have a dog. Ms. Kikuchi seems to be under the impression that her scenes were rehearsals as she can't quite hash out a consistent approach (translated: she is painful to watch). The usually great Elba alternates between a mumbled whisper and a full-out yell ... neither working too well. His ""canceling the apocalypse"" speech seems to be right out of Independence Day.<br/><br/>The comedy relief is provided by the shared scenes of Charlie Day and del Toro favorite Ron Perlman. Day is at his screechiest and Perlman at his most flamboyant, but it's not enough of the story to salvage much hope. Instead we get an endless number of hand-to-hand combat scenes between Jaeger and Kaiju. And they mostly all look the same: waist deep in water while its dark and rainy. Unless they happen to be completely underwater, where it's even darker.<br/><br/>For all the negatives tossed out here, it must be ended with the reminder that the movie is a technical marvel to look at. I much prefer del Toro in the Pan's Labyrinth mode, and I would even prefer the old Japanese Godzilla monster-fests to this, but he has raised the bar for robotic and monster CGI. Maybe that's enough for your eyes and ears."

","Robots and monsters, how could anyone go wrong with this combo?<br/><br/>This movie does not disappoint and it provides a great theater experience. The film is fast paced and has stunning special effects. I think that sometimes we really take for granted some of the CGI and effects that these big budget movies tend to produce, but this flick has some of the best.<br/><br/>If you have the means, Google your nearest IMAX theater and see this in IMAX 3D. I caught the early (Thursday night) preview of this movie in regular 3D and it was really great, but just saw the movie again in IMAX 3D and it really enhances the experience. Yes, it's pricey, but this film is well worth it.<br/><br/>I know there are always a few reviews that will always be critical of something; we tend to criticize way too much. Do yourself a favor and just go see it. You will NOT be disappointed.<br/><br/>Excellent movie. Great special effects. Good story line. Enough said!"
"Robert_duder","5","2","11","18 July 2013"," Did Asylum films make both versions?
","Here are my expectations for this film. They were not high. I knew the concept was about giant robots fighting giant monsters so science fiction is an understatement. I expected HUGE special effects mixed with a disaster flick and a dash of what made the Transformer's movies good or at least decent. I even went so far as to check this out on 3D IMAX which was granted very impressive because its a huge screen and the monsters and robots that are in this are massive, beyond the scope of imagination. But that little niche is only impressive for the first half hour or so. Then you begin to realize how completely empty and vapid the film is. The characters are downright awful, the story is literally pathetic and if not for the impressive visuals and the experience of seeing it on IMAX, I might have even scored it lower. I was thoroughly and nearly completely disappointed. I am confounded that IMDb reviewers are giving this a 10 and that many many many people are talking about how great it is. A friend of mine said that it was awesome because it didn't take itself seriously and thank god for that because what a ridiculous mess the story is. Is it a B-Movie? Yes definitely and maybe they were trying for that but when you spend 200+ Million on a film you don't want to see camp and cheese. I expect at least a decent story. The Asylum I mention in my title is Asylum films who make awful ""Mockbusters"" and while I haven't seen Atlantic Rim yet (renamed Attack From Beneath for DVD release) I can't imagine it being worse than the actual version.<br/><br/>There are virtually no stars in Pacific Rim and that is unforgivable in this type of blockbuster. The film was desperately crying out for a major name with big charisma. Chris Pine, Matt Damon, Ryan Reynolds, hell even Bruce Willis could have made this more watchable. Instead they cast Sons of Anarchy star Charlie Hunman in the lead role and act like he's a major star. They did that with several characters where they shot them from certain angles or gave them certain scenes as though they were huge Hollywood stars and that was cheesy. Hunman is bland and boring and ridiculous in the role. Worst of all, he's still playing Jax from Sons of Anarchy. He swagger walks his way through this film like a biker and it looks dumb. Idris Elba might be the biggest name in the film. He also does a decent job especially compared to Hunman. His character is decent and he brings a little bit of chemistry to the screen so bravo to him but it doesn't help. I also find it odd and distracting that Elba's English accent seemed to float in and out intermittently. Wherever Rinko Kikuchi came from, she needs to go back there fast. She is an example of someone that nobody knows and yet they act like she is Michelle Yeo and we should be impressed that she's in the film. Her acting is simply awful and the chemistry between her Hunman is excruciatingly bad. Their one good scene was the training scene together (which makes no sense to the film but was one of the few good scenes.) Ron Perlman was the one great cameo and a great character and he was fun, had some good lines and a great scene. He might be the one redeeming quality in the film if Elba isn't enough. Certainly his cult status made him at least recognizable. Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky are okay in their roles but achingly predictable and cookie cutter characters we've seen hundreds of times before. None of the aforementioned characters though can compare to how truly atrociously awful the characters played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are. These two play Scientists and their performance belongs in the worst kind of low budget smut you could find. Gorman is literally painful to watch how awful he is. And if you want to tell me that it was sarcasm or clever irony I will slap you because both characters were two of the worst I have ever seen and shame on these actors for doing so.<br/><br/>Speaking of shame...shame on Guillermo del Toro, a talented storyteller for making this crap. I am still in shock at how many reviewers, professional and average movie goers are loving this. The story is so bad that it goes nowhere. They don't even spend any time at all building you up to the story. The film begins and the narration says ""Giant Monsters attacked the world, we built robots, here are the robots, we fight the monsters...and go""...it drops you right into the battle. So the first battle is impressive and a little fun to watch and certainly visually stunning. The second, third, fourth etc etc battle which are the same thing over and over and over again is so incredibly tired and unoriginal. I have often spoke out against the crowds for films that I thought were incredibly entertaining (White House Down most recently) so now I am bravely going against the crowd to either warn you about what you're about to sit through or perhaps open your eyes and make you realize how bad this was. It was probably one of the worst movies yet of the summer. Its another HUGE example in the vein of Jack The Giant Slayer, Battleship and John Carter of ALL flash and absolutely no substance. Poorly done Mr. Del Toro. 5/10"
"Drumpot","6","2","11","11 July 2013"," 6/10 Not bad , but not great . .
","I saw this on Tuesday and had little expectations. I suppose the best comparison I could make is the same expectations that I had with Battleship, except more depth (because it was directed by Del Toros).<br/><br/>I found the characters clichéd and wafer thin. I found a lot of dialogue equally clichéd and corny. The special effects were superb, but a lot of the fight scenes were in the dark and (particularly in the sea) I found it hard to follow fights.<br/><br/>I also found the humour a little bit thrown together (as opposed to being part of the story). In the original transformers movie, I think it had a charming humour that made it more fun then this movie.<br/><br/>I didn't care for the characters (in fact, by far the best character only had a few mins on screen time) and the actor I really looked forward to didn't really have a character I enjoyed or cared about (and his speech about the apocalypse wasn't really that inspiring).<br/><br/>I gave it 6/10 because despite these flaws it passed the time away and I didn't come out hating it. I just felt it could of been so much more. Its unfair to compare a directors previous movies that are completely different, but Del Toros can tell good stories, create brilliant worlds and have lovable characters. I felt this movie was really lacking in story and character."

If that sounds like you, don't waste your time on this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy WWE, over the top special effects, and can overlook 2nd grade level concepts of science and engineering, you may actually enjoy this film.

","*SPOILERS* <br/><br/>Pacific Rim for me personally sucks! I have been watching yesterday this movie and I was disappointed a lot! This movie was boring, over long, the character were boring, I didn't care for any of the characters! The story makes no sense to me, robots are fighting against Kaiju monsters that were aliens, I had no clue what those aliens wanted from destroying the city's?! This movie was so boring that I had to go to sleep 3 times in the row! <br/><br/>I hate this film, the writing was awful, the plot felt half-baked, the acting was crap and it was horrible. I am really disappointed why was I even bother watching this movie. Now it is getting a sequel and I am definitely not going to see the sequel and I don't care for! <br/><br/>This movie was directed by Guillermo del Toro and I am not really a fan of this guy, the only 2 movies I have enjoyed from this guy is Mimic (1997) and Blade II (2002)! I have already reviewed that movie, it is definitely my favorite film. I have been watching just recently Mimic and I was surprised how good monster horror film that was and I am going to reviewed. Mimic is Miles way better than this crap film and it is way underrated. I never seen Hellboy movies and I am not planning too either, but those two films Mimic and Blade II are my favorite films from this guy! <br/><br/>I just wanted to see Robots vs. Monsters. Instead I get boring characters, story, and 'development. If you like this film, good for you your opinion, my opinion is this film was lazy writing, boring and wooden film with dull not logical story, terrible acting and horrible CGI and dull characters! <br/><br/>I hate Charlie Day in this film, I don't like his comedy's in this movie, Pacfic Rim supposed to be a fun popcorn Sci-Fi action film and not a boring comedy! His acting was the worst in the film I have seen, he sucks in here!<br/><br/>Films I have enjoyed more than this crap: Battleship (2012), Independence Day (1996), Aliens (1986) and even Battle Los Angeles (2011) are way better alien films, they don't have robots in it but they are at least fun! <br/><br/>I had such a terrible experience with this movie and it is such a letdown! <br/><br/>The whole movie was about the good guys getting their asses kicked and being all emotional, they never stood a chance against the enemy and they only won because they cheated at the end by self destructing their last robot in the enemy base.<br/><br/>The whole plot is so terribly thought out, like, we have this giant powerful sword, but we will not use it till the very end? they mind-meld and supposed to share all the memories and everything and know everything the other person knows but yet he didn't know about the sword? and if they had such technology from the very first start, why didn't they use it? they could have just sliced all those monsters in half and none of the pilots would have died, its just stupid.<br/><br/>CGI of Kaiju was awful and terrible, I wasn't convincing about this movie! <br/><br/>Idris Elba and Robert Kazinsky died in this movie which is a let down! <br/><br/>The rating for this movie is F 1/10 it failed of been a good film, Pacific Rim is a time waster, boring as hell, it is a poor movie, over-hyped lazy ass not much to do movie. I care less about the fighting or the swords in this awful horrible film!"

But these Human Robots do have secret weapons, (sword) which they use 1 second before being completely destroyed. The defense plating on them is as thick as a coca-cola can and their god damn weapons are so damn slow like in this one scene where it took the robot 20 seconds to charge its damn laser weapon but then could fire it because the alien ripped of the arm holding the laser.

There's no such thing as a last resort weapon unless it's a weapon of mass destruction that's gonna kill everyone around you. Still, otherwise than that I kinda enjoyed it so I'll give it a 5. But there is another contradiction, if you have to have Kaiju DNA to go through the bridge, how come Raliegh could escape through it?

"dinalt10","3","1","4","12 November 2013"," Mutton dressed as lamb
","First off, how does this film justify a 7.2 rating (at the time of writing) ????? I'm giving it a 3 - but that's purely for the effort that went into some of the effects.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm struggling to find much that even justifies writing a review..............I guess the only reason is to stop someone else wasting their life watching this.<br/><br/>Possibly it was better on the big screen. Maybe the effects managed to numb peoples expectations - on the small screen (I've just endured the DVD) it's hopeless.<br/><br/>Let's start by saying it takes elements from many other films and even TV series - clichéd characters, 'power ranger' type robots, destruction etc etc.<br/><br/>Now a lack of originality isn't a problem. But when you get a lack of originality coupled with a poor script, a film's doomed - no matter how many tens of millions you throw at special effects.<br/><br/>And despite the massive budget, I had no real sense of the robots or the alien invaders actually being huge.<br/><br/>Therein lies the problem - a lot of the action was in the water, where to be honest you didn't get a real impression of size.<br/><br/>And when the action actually made it onto land, it was in bland areas where you got no real impression of leviathans battling it out.<br/><br/>Then you've got the idea of the pilots 'drifting'. Cool idea, but poorly executed. If the pilots were controlling the robots with their brains, how come they needed to move around like they were in a gym lol.<br/><br/>If the robot reacted purely to the pilots movement, why would that have any effect on a pilots brain ?? The suits were transmitting the necessary movements - not the pilots brains, as evidenced by the Aussie one who damaged his arm being unable to pilot later in the film.<br/><br/>If the robot was being controlled in any way by the pilots brain, then it wouldn't have mattered if the pilot was totally unable to move.<br/><br/>So a lot of time the effects seemed to be wasted..............I'd go so far as to say the battles in Godzilla films were more impressive (and they were largely guys in suits).<br/><br/>Okay, so in my view the effects were wasted - how about the storyline ? Hmmmm - if you were expecting the script to make up for it, think again.<br/><br/>This makes 'Battleship' look like Shakespeare lol. Hell, it's a film that makes another big robot film look good (Robot Jox).<br/><br/>Clichéd characters and script, and scientists (I use the term loosely) who make Bill and Ted look like Einstein.<br/><br/>Usually I'm a big fan of Burn Gorman - he's a great actor with a good range. But in this, his 'scientist' was horribly over the top - maybe a parody of Lee Evans ? This performance being counterbalanced by a heavily tattooed Charlie Day, who also didn't convince as a scientist.<br/><br/>Not their fault - maybe they were meant to be light relief, but they were just annoying.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast - two dimensional at best. Again, not the actors fault - the script was seriously lacking.<br/><br/>If this had been a low budget film you could understand the lack of suspense, excitement and poor script.<br/><br/>But Guillermo Del Toro is usually an excellent director. The film had the budget and the pedigree to be amazing - instead of which, for me it fell flat.<br/><br/>Maybe it would have benefited from having recognisable landmarks being trashed.<br/><br/>Would probably have benefited from having more explanation of why the worlds leaders thought building walls was a good idea. In fact any kind of back story would have been good - instead of which we get clichéd sacrifices, a kind of love story thrown in and all against a dull backdrop."

The Plot is fresh the characters are well thought out, i loved Raleigh and Mako's chemistry it was well paced. The action was intense, come on, giant robots vs big monsters? how is that not cool? the CGI is gorgeous, very well done and realistic. Bottom line Pacific Rim grips you and makes you want more more.

The acting was also up to par and the character development was fantastic, giving life and depth to characters that seem at first to be a bit superficial.

","I must admit that ""Pacific Rim"" was all that I expected it to be, but also all that I feared it to be. The movie is another ""Skyline""; all spectacular CGI visual effects and a shallow mockery of a storyline. Everything here just screams textbook step-by-step heroic story.<br/><br/>The world is threatened by an extraterrestrial superior life form that comes to Earth through a rift in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. The nations of Earth put aside their differences and feeble politics to unite against this outer-wordly threat. And they build massive war machines that are driven by people to fight these gargantuan reptilian invaders.<br/><br/>That was basically the entire storyline, and for some reason director Guillermo del Toro needed 131 minutes to tell a story that could have been told in one-third of the spent time.<br/><br/>Right from the very beginning, you know the exact outcome of the movie, and there isn't a single surprise throughout the entire movie, which was sort of too much in a singular easy to be one step in front of the movie at all times. This was what the movie suffered from. Well, that and the appalling fact that the movie was a very weak excuse of a storyline.<br/><br/>Which leads me on to the characters. The characters in the movie were actually more like caricatures than actual characters. They were wooden and had really awkward and often bad dialogue to work with. And the people behind these caricatures were doing alright jobs given the nature of the movie, but I can't really say that there was any one performance that stood out as being overly memorable compared to the others in the movie.<br/><br/>That being said, then I will say that the CGI special effects in ""Pacific Rim"" is off the charts, and it looks nothing short of spectacular. The creatures were very realistic and moved about in a very believable way. Although they were a bit on the simplistic side in terms of creativity in the creature design. The war machines were nice as well, although I think the whole part about them needing two pilots to work in symbiosis was a little bit stupid.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a Sci-Fi movie that requires absolutely nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, from your brain, then ""Pacific Rim"" is a great way to spend 131 minutes in dazzling special effects, CGI galore and fluorescent neon lighting.<br/><br/>I am rating ""Pacific Rim"" a 6 out of 10 stars, purely because of the CGI effects that is dazzling and a real treat for the eyes. This is indeed a movie suitable for a day where you are nurturing a hangover, feeling sick, or just need to lay on the couch with your brain sent away on holiday.

","This is a a typical ""you don't need to think"" movie, I was hoping for more considering I like Guillermo del Toro's previous films.

In lack of imagination they wrote a typical corny love story that you've seen a thousand times before. The character played by Charlie Hunnam sounded tired and bored, on the other hand, Idris Elba did a brilliant job as well as Rinko Kikuchi, which brings me to another bad thing about this movie namely that it is only one woman among the main characters, tiresome and old-fashioned, would love to have seen it a bit more up to date. The good thing about this movie was the special effects, they were actually quite powerful and impressive and that's why it's getting a 4 and not less."

","That might be a daunting challenge for some; not to demean anyone, but those are some of the common words used to express their opinion on this film. 8/10 sounds like a bit much, but I'm one of the people who gave Freddy vs Jason a 7/10 for being a great guilty pleasure, and the same is said here. I can probably name off more things wrong with this movie than actual praise. <br/><br/>For example, the title is horrible. There's probably so many porn jokes about this title, that it ends up being funny. This title does not emote sci-fi like what any movie should, I asked people about if they were going to see it, but half of the time they didn't know what I was talking about. Now this decision debatable, that this movie has no big name star. It had Tom Cruise for awhile, but that changed. This probably might have done a bit better at the box office, had it star a successful actor. Of course the big thing that every negative has, the fact that the actors present do not convey their characters and go through poor; if not none, character development. I agree, it happens right at the beginning, when the brother dies. The did not build it up the slightest, so when he died I didn't care the slightest. The whole movie is like that, whenever your not seeing Mech-suits bashing gargantuan creatures, your most likely bored, I was at least. <br/><br/>Since I listed a few of the problems with movie and said that there was some praise, you probably already know what is. It's the action, no detective work required. But it's really good, you won't be able to convince me that the action is bad in anyway. Good angles, the effects, the movement, and my god the score. The trumpets and guitar in the background, makes the Evangelion wannabes look like titans walking amongst shattered Earth and preparing to face off against the scaled menace. While on the subject go violence, I have say that the names of these towering models of steel are oddly named, Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha are okay, But Striker Eureka and Gypsy danger? When I heard Gypsy danger I was thinking about that purple robot from Mst3k. Names are forgivable, poorly killing them off is not. For example, Crimson Typhoon is killed off first. It shows off it's one gimmick: doing a judo throw, and then dies from the head being crushed. If you thought that was bad Cherno Alpha gets it worse, it doesn't even have a gimmick that it shows off, and gets double teamed on. With that at least you get a ""tragic"" death. If anything, they make it look like it really sucks to be them right then. Look at that, I'm back to ranting about why this should suck. One last subject, the sword. It's idiotic how they did not use it earlier, they don't give anything suggesting why the pilots couldn't use it, and so it's okay to say that it's stupid that they did not do it earlier.<br/><br/>Final words, after all this ranting and what have you, why 8/10? If you were paying attention, you would have noticed sentence: guilty pleasure, and that sums up everything about Pacific Rim. The acting horrible, it makes no sense on some degrees, but it's fun to watch. If I wasn't having as much fun with it as I did, then this probably an average 6/10. So with that said, I can't wait for the Blu-ray and when it's here I'll probably watch it dozens of times more."

","Contains spoilers: I know this movie is based in some short of comic/manga but realistically the idea of making such robots as humanity's last resort for fighting these creatures was ridiculous and wouldn't be efficient at all in reality. a good strong armor-piercing rocket and we are done. the out of no where somehow adopted by the general Japanese girl, the even worse out of nowhere romance between her and the protagonist (-""don't you see it, we connect really good ""neurally"""",-""i'm a creep stalker girl i know everything about you,haha chuckles"", it started somehow like that), and the general (ex superhero) going all autonomous don't giving a damn about the orders given from above and continuing his mission like a boss to his own will. the strange kind of feel mixing unrelated environments, gadgets and technology with a futuristic colour every now and then. creation of stupid walls that demanded a great budget and human resourses (when they should be repairing the damaged cities n realistically enhancing their defenses) which had no actual purpose and fell like paperstructures in front of everyones' (surprised(!)) eyes. the governments of the world letting the black market to freely go and scavage whatever and in any quantity they want from the alien remains, because they have whatsoever no interest in the completely unknown giant alien race that is attacking the whole planet. and all their discoveries about them happen the last minute from two cracked up scientists with the most unbelievable way. and many many other things that wont come now. (well i waited for something better from the creator of pan's labyrinth...)<br/><br/>boring, predictable, tons of cgi, no (great) acting nor an actual plot existing, no realism or any believable political, intriguing and dynamically evolving environment or characters. with a few words. pop corn teen flick. proceed on your own risk..."
"corpse_man","6","1","4","12 October 2013"," Robotjox with giant Aliens thrown in
","My summary says it all. This movie is basically just like the 1989 movie ""robotjox"", but instead of the robots fighting each other, they fight giant aliens. The acting is just as cheesy and the overall feel to the movie feels just as unprofessional as Robotjox as well.<br/><br/>The plot and the characters are a little cliché, but I have to admit, the special effects and action were very, very good. The movie wasn't a total bust. But this is coming from someone who even liked Robotjox just because it was so painfully bad, it somehow made it seem good to me, as if it was a parody of itself. Pacific rims doesn't quite do that for me, but it wasn't a TOTAL waste of time. I had fun, and I suspect anyone under the age of 14 will love it."
"JRmf","6","1","4","12 October 2013"," OK for a monster movie but...
","If it's stunning CGI then Pacific Rim has to be near the top. The story and character development is OK, but the one thing I will remember about the movie is the CGI. Which makes for a fairly forgettable movie..<br/><br/>The Kaiju themselves, as well as the Jaeger way of dealing with them, was incredible, but OK if we accept that the name-of-the-game is popcorn fantasy/escapism. But for the serious sci-fi geek like myself, I couldn't help being plagued throughout by the thought of what a silly way it was of dealing with them. What, you think one of these things could not be taken out by a well-placed cruise missile, or an air-to-surface one for that matter.<br/><br/>If the world's survival was really at stake, low-yield nuclear munitions would be employed. What creature can withstand a 1 kiloton direct-hit? (unless they had some sort of impenetrable force-field, but then they'd be invulnerable to just about anything anyway, including Jaeger attack). Hiding is not an option if you're a Kaiju.<br/><br/>Still, nothing is as impressive as giants in hand-to-hand combat, which is clearly the point of the whole exercise. Everything else in the movie - Mako's past story, brain-melding with a Kaiju, final destruction of the inter-dimensional link - seemed to be subsumed to this one goal, of showing titans striving to defeat the other, so that by the end of the movie I was clock-watching (boring...). Promising thread, like the Kaiju being directed systematically by some higher intelligence, and brain-melding with them, were never explored in any depth.<br/><br/>I guess it's what puts bums-on-seats and makes that ca'ching sound that mostly counts, not making intelligent sci-fi.<br/><br/>Still happy to have this in my SF collection, but the best it is not."

This movie is a rip off of so many classic movies I am honestly surprised they haven't been sued. The script is so cheesy even dairy farmers are complaining. The special effects are very good though, so I am going to give this thing 2 stars. 1 for the effects and 1 for the producers and directors for having the courage to put their names to it.<br/><br/>I think I would rather watch ""Killer clowns from outer space"" again and I can't even begin to describe how bad that is."
"vertical-penguin","7","1","4","6 October 2013"," A fun ""live action"" Anime.
","I enjoyed this movie a great deal. It is a classic ""leave your brain at the door"" type of flick, but it is immensely fun. Being a fan of Anime, especially Anime centered around Mechas, I had a feeling that I would like this film, and I did, very much. <br/><br/>Pluses: The special effects were phenomenal. The Mechas and monsters had real ""weight"" to them and moved naturally and fluidly. The camera-work in the action scenes was easily followable, and fluid as well, unlike the Transformers movies, which kind of give me a headache. The Story, although pretty basic and 'over the top' science, was right off the pages of a Manga, and the Japanese female character had great short hair with blue streaks and big 'ol Anime eyes. (pretty obvious that she was picked for her looks more so than her acting abilities) and all-in-all real cool. This movie also, because of the fast pace and good action (there are a few scenes that drug a little, but I'll be forgiving) makes for a lot of rewatchability, which, for me at least, A lot of movies like this, don't have. <br/><br/>I do have a couple of negatives however; one being the acting wasn't too great, not painfully bad though, and honestly didn't detract from the fun of the film. The musical score by The RZA was pretty lame. It really didn't seem to fit with the movie, and in most scenes, kind of took the life out of the fight scenes a bit with it's funky groove. Dialogue, although had some amusing homages to many o' Sci-Fi flicks, was kind of listless and just seemed lacking, no real memorable lines from the whole film. And lastly, although they were pretty cool, I think they could have done better with the look of the Kaiju, they all just kind of looked like the 1999 ""Godzilla"" and the aliens from ""Independence Day"" had a love child, and it was a bit difficult to discern between them. 'THIS ONE IS A LEVEL FIVE!!!' ... And it looks pretty much just like all the others, so I can't really feel how bad ass it is. *shrug* That all being said, very fun, very enjoyable movie to waste a couple of hours, down right *must see* for Japanese Anime/Manga and monster flicks fans out there. A solid 7, above par, will watch again, but not anything mind blowing. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review."

Colourful and clean imagery and entertaining badass fights. There are plenty of jaw dropping visual effects and I really liked how easy was to identify the robots and monsters (nulike in transformers).<br/><br/>The whole thing just sucked me in and I never had the feeling I was watching a two hours long movie.

","If you like Anime and Manga then this is your ultimate movie if not, you still might be happy with the special effects and the the unintended laughs. In all the fairness most SF movies show disrespect for the laws of physics, however the worth-watching ones provide us with either a decent explanation (e.g. Matrix)or they just keep it simple in order to avoid potentially embarrassing details (e.g Kryptonite powers). Pacific Rim's director has chosen the nonsensical approach (e.g. Giant robots weighing thousands of tons are lifted by helicopters). It is not the abundance of plot holes that surprised me but the fact that many of them could have been easily avoided with minimal effort. It seems that the director was concerned only to deliver CGIs and clichés. Have fun."

","Pacific Rim is simply one of the best 'blockbuster' film of the year. It is always difficult to make a film like this, which is not based on comic books, novels or an established fan base. The film is mammoth in terms of production evident by the large scale design. The film pitches the massive Jaegers against the mighty Kaijus in an last ditch effort to save humanity. Rarely there comes a film that hits all the right nodes, be it action, direction, acting, story or visual effects. It has stunning action sequences and when not in action mode, the story keeps viewers interested. The film should get an Oscar for best visual effects! Guillermo del toro and his team of designers have so lovingly created every kaiju and jaeger that they deserve a standing ovation for their brilliant work. Charlie hunnam is a likable lead and Idris Elba has a commanding screen presence. The whole cast delivers and Ron perlman and Charlie day are hilarious!!!. All in all its a must watch for everybody. It appeals to the 12 year old inside all of us!!!!"

These robots must be piloted by 2 humans in tandem to defeat the evil foe. This was amazing to watch with incredible special effects. It is an Sci Fi delight. Costing over $190 million to make, the action is incredible. The cast is not full of known actors except for Ron Perlman who is wonderful in his slimy role, never the less they do a great job.

","Pacific Rim delivered exactly what it promised from the trailers. Spectacular action scenes. This film is not going to win any awards or be considered high art or anything but if it is one thing, it is highly entertaining without worrying about being criticised for being ""dumb"", and call me simple minded or whatever, but I think that's kind of refreshing to see every once in a while, especially in this day and age of big budgeted, heavy drama filled action films. <br/><br/>The story isn't really important, but basically, monsters are coming from an inter-dimensional portal in the Pacific Ocean and destroying the humans so that their alien masters would be able to colonise Earth no problem. The armies of Earth develop giant humanoid robots to fight back against these monsters and thus you have Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>The only real criticisms I have is that maybe the drama scenes go on a bit too long as we as an audience don't really care about any of these characters but it is well worth it for the amazing spectacular actions scenes that look as though they came straight out of a mech anime. I can't really explain this action scenes in great detail, they have to be seen.<br/><br/>If you want a little time killer to entertain you for a couple of hours and are a big fan of stuff like Godzilla or Gundam, then Pacific Rim is highly recommended."

","When I first saw the trailer for ""Pacific Rim,"" I said to myself ""Rock'em, Sock'em Robots"". I mean, the idiot-level concept that the gigantic monsters would not be stopped by torpedoes, missiles or guns at sea or a submarine net rigged with explosives or electricity just seemed to stupid to endure. However, two things made me change my mind: 1) my wife wanted to see it and 2) the movie had a really beautiful ""look"" (thanks to topnotch production values and use of a RED camera (the same camera used for ""Step-up Revolution). Minutes into the movie, my other suspicions were confirmed: 1) this movie is marketed to an international cast, as the the three main characters are all of different races and nationalities; and 2) the storyline would be one cliché after another.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I rate ""Pacific Rim"" highly for the acting, direction, music and those aforementioned production values. Even the cliché plot lines seem fresh and original due to the fine acting; especially Idris Elba, who could impress reading a soup can. Also, always welcome, is Ron Perlman, who somehow always manages to class up the most ridiculous projects.<br/><br/>With a cast of real actors, not stars, the most modest of romances and lots of violent action, this movie screams ""International (particularly Asian) project"". I certainly expected to see more Asian names among the technical credits. However, when one figures three-fourths of this movies grosses came from outside the US, it is clear Guillermo del Toro intended to make an international film, and he certainly made a handsome one. I give ""Pacific Rim"" a ""7""."

After tremendous losses, the world got together to build massive robots called Jaegers. However, the monsters keep coming, faster and bigger. Now the Jaegers are stretched to the limit with resources being diverted to building a wall.<br/><br/>Director Guillermo del Toro is having a lot of boyhood fun with robots battling monsters. It doesn't get more childhood fun than this. The designs are beautiful and original with both the robots and monsters. There is nothing more youth affirming than playing with these toys. The characters are solid with interesting actors like Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba. Coming into this, I feared the story would be too silly or convoluted.

Art style and costume/set work is also good, crew seems to have done a great job all around.<br/><br/>I leave many things out for the sake of storytelling but these issues are ridiculous and detracted from my enjoyment of the film: The ""obsolete"" Jaeger is the only one powered by a nuclear reactor and toting plasma cannons. I'll repeat that: the old, outdated machine is the one with nuclear-powered plasma cannons. It also is based on analog systems, which makes sense given that it was built after the year 2000.<br/><br/>The only hope for humanity is defunded in favor of a wall-building strategy. Because building 20,000+ miles of wall is cheaper than building robots to defend it. Oh, and walls are a strategic solution to invaders - not a tactical advantage for active defense forces.<br/><br/>Let's fight the enemy with our robo-fists instead of the gigantic collapsible swords we've been carrying around this entire time. This makes sense because bare fists were the weapon of choice right up until the invention of guns; nobody used swords or other metal weapons because they're terrible at cutting through organic material.<br/><br/>Let's fight and save ourselves with the incredible force of our fire-blasting reactor exhaust which nobody bothered to weaponize on our robot or any other.<br/><br/>Let's destroy a planet-threatening rift in space-time with a single 1.25 Mt warhead, because 12 ft bombs are too big for our giant robots to carry multiple of.<br/><br/>Nuclear weapons are in the form of gigantic backpacks for robots.<br/><br/>Nuclear reactors explode like nuclear weapons when they melt down.<br/><br/>Let's send 20 helicopters to pick up 2 survivors."

Same goes for the pilots of the Jägers - most of them anyway.<br/><br/>Which brings me to what I think is a second flaw of this movie, the eagerness to please the audience across the world trying to find characters that everyone could potentially relate to. Which is why I guess they chose to have people from every large country represented; the abandoned Japanese girl, the American hero, the hardcore Russians, the versatile Chinese and the ranger Australians with heavy accent! It gets a bit ridiculous - especially when you notice the ""iron curtain"" music when the Russians are presented - too much and you stop believing this is actual how a professional set of trained military personal would behave."

","Once again, I was proved wrong in judging a movie by its trailer. At first, it looked to me to be a sub-par sci-fi idea. I thought it to be, frankly, stupid. And my enthusiasm to see it in the theater did not change much when I was surprised with a stub granting access to a 3D viewing. But, once the action began, I began to see my mistake. Pacific Rim is a wildly exciting film. Although, it is more visually than plot centered. But the visuals are so immersive and seemingly possible, one forgets until the end how much of an engineering impossibility all the Jaegers really are. But, as pointed out in the trailer, it is very cool. The visuals more than make up for the flaws, of which some are quite glaring. For one, why didn't the Gypsy Danger pilots always use that invincible sword? Which also makes one wonder why all the Jaegers don't have the sword. Which in turn brings to mind why the Jaeger program was necessary in the first place. All the allied countries could have built hundreds of plasma cannons and shot the Kaijus. None of the human training would have been necessary. Also, that nuclear reaction nearing the end of the movie should have killed Becket and Mori. Making a good ending seems to be really tough these days and Pacific Rim sadly did not manage to make a satisfactory one. Lastly, as was seen first in the promo posters, the Jaegers heavily resemble Spartans from Halo. A bit of a rip off, really. But no matter, this is a very cool movie and well worth the time in my mind. Watched 07/17/2013, written 08/04/2013.<br/><br/>This is my first of hopefully many reviews on IMDb.

The fight scenes were well choreographed and well shot. Guillermo Navarro outdid himself with this visual gem; it's easy to understand why Guillermo Del Toro has used him on most of his films. The story allows for a lot of imagination and doesn't feel the need to address all of the points of the world it created. I appreciate that in a film. The other portion of this film that I love is the ending. It lets the climax taper of naturally, a rare thing in modern cinema. Too many movies have to answer so many questions at the end that it gets drug out far too long. Not Pacific Rim, it wraps everything up in a neat package and sends us on our way.

I do like the fact that the this being one of the hits for summer blockbuster that instead of the aliens coming from in the middle of the space they come from the pacific rim (hence the title) because this gives an alternate and more pressing need for the world to unite against a common enemy than other movies.

","I first, i want to say that this movie is really good, and worth to watch. They have done a very good job. The acting, the story, the emotion are good. The only thing i think it missing are the fighting scenes. The jaggers are destroyed so easily, there are only 4 jaggers, and indeed, only 2 can fight. <br/><br/>Most of the fights are just hand-to-hand combat. The 2 jaggers have little time to show their ability. They even cant fire any missile or use any special weapon. They have a lot of heave weapons, but i wonder why they did not use them ( the weapons) in the beginning. Overall, i enjoyed this movie, and some scenes are really moving."

","Pacific Rim is basically a movie about epic battles between aliens called Kaiju & robots called Jaegers. Jaeger pilot, Raleigh Becket(Charlie Hunnam) pairs up with trainee, Mako Mori(Rinko Kikuchi) to drive a unique Jaeger that does not run on electricity, in a last ditch effort to once and for all stop the Kaiju. Heading the Jaeger pilots is, General Stacker Pentecost(Idris Elba). <br/><br/>I would like to start by saying, I really enjoyed the film. It is a treat for all action & sci-fi fans. The 3D is spectacular, especially in all the battles between the Jaegers & the Kaiju. The only problem I had with this movie was that, it had no substantial story. Almost the entire movie consists of robots & alien monsters beating the crap out of each other. I'm not complaining though. It's just that the movie would have been much better if it had a solid story as well. A note on the performances. Charlie Hunnam is brilliant as Raleigh Becket. Idris Elba is outstanding as Stacker Pentecost. Rinko Kikuchi is impressive as Mako Mori. Charlie Day is hysterical as Dr. Newton Geiszler. He was the only character to provide constant comic relief in the film. Burn Gorman is effective as Gottlieb. The supporting characters are effective as well. All in all, Pacific Rim is not a must watch, unless you're an action fan. However, go for it if you have some time to kill. You won't regret it."

","Del Toro (the director) grew up watching Japanese Monster movies from Toho pictures. His reaction - like everyone else's - was 'Why can't we have more monster action and less human talk?' The child del Toro has grown up, and has made precisely such a film with all the CGI that he can muster. So go expecting to see monsters grappling with giant robots every ten minutes in full glorious colour and technical brilliance. Any other attitude is just being stupid! The story is simple - giant sea monsters are appearing all over the world and wrecking cities. Cue human response is to build giant mechanical monsters driven by two people in bonded mind meld ('the drift'). The fights are a cross between WWF and some vicious swords and rocketry battles! The action is very spectacular and what CGI does best - it beats hands down any of the overlong Zod/Superman face offs in 'Man of Steel.' A pity then that the monsters are not individualised enough, as in Godzilla movies, so that the action is a little muzzy and repetitive. And the real villains look like a rerun of 'Independence Day.' But go turn off brain and enjoy - and have a rest from pathetic attempts at darkness and depth of comic book hero movies!!"

"EmmaDinkins","Null","1","5","13 July 2013"," Chix Chat on Film review: A true monster movie
","What I really want to do is write about Idris Elba (Stacker Pentacost) and how his walk is poetry in motion, and that I could stare at him for the 131 minutes running time of this film with his commanding presence while gracing us with confidence and style, but that would be unfair, since I should discuss Pacific Rim. This film reminded me of the old Godzilla monster movies akin to the likes of Godzilla versus Megalon. Those films always had the populous running for their lives while Tokyo was perpetually being destroyed, but the update to the tale is that the origin of the monster attacks does not come from nuclear fallout. This film was not as campy as the early Godzilla films, but there was a healthy level of cheesiness, although played very straight with Charlie Day (Dr. Newton Geiszler) as the only comic relief, which is somewhat odd since he plays a scientist. He actually looks the part, but if he ever wants to be taken seriously in a role he has to change his voice inflections and tone, which is very comedic. If all the English and Australian actors can do it I'm sure he can. This film was primarily driven by the special effects, since going in there was little doubt as to how the story would end. The last film that I saw that had a truly surprising end was Cabin in the Woods, I digress. The special effects were most noteworthy because the scale of the jaegers and the kaijus was strikingly convincing. With their movements, when the fights broke out and when buildings were destroyed, I simply marveled at the fact that these creations looked remarkably real. I'm not sure why the notion that a tall wall will keep anything out but it was yet again tested in this film, but again the scale was amazing. The kaiju unfortunately were never shown much clearer in the film than what was seen in the trailer, when they appeared it was either dark, raining, shown as a television broadcast or they were underwater all of which were distorting factors. We did get a nice variety though, with similarities to a turtle, gorilla, and a pterodactyl. This was a testosterone filled ride, there were only two females with any dialogue in the entire film and one of them was quite masculine. It seemed that the target audience was tween and teenaged young men who would get a kick out of the fight scenes, there was a miniscule love story but not enough to make this film a female fan favorite. It was entertaining so I give it an amber light."

Definitely one to add to the DVD collection along with ""Independence Day"", ""Armageddon"" ""2012"" ""Transformers"" and all the other cliché budget busting Action/Sci-fi movies that you'll watch over and over again.

","I'm a horrible reviewer, writer and expresser of thoughts, but I love monster movies. So why on earth would you go to a giant robots vs. giant monsters movie expecting Hamlet? While the plot is razor thin the monsters and battles are beyond incredible! There is enough plot to move the story along, the characters are likable and, while there is certainly campiness, it does not take the movie to stupidity. (I'm thinking Transformers 2) I will watch a movie simply for atmosphere and FX. That being said, Battleship was completely awful. Del Toro does not take us to absurd, certainly suspension of belief is required, but not to a point of eye-rolling, more like a huge grin because of the enormity of the monsters, robots, and positive energy in this film. Walk into this ready to pick apart every minor detail, plot hole, or sub-standard acting and you will have a bad movie experience.

"iamstemo","5","1","6","6 August 2013"," I did not hate this movie, however, the reception it has received? Thats a different story...
","First of all, I'd like to clarify: Did I think this was a good movie? Yes. But did I think this was a groundbreaking masterpiece? Hell no. <br/><br/>There is very little to be said about this movie, I had a pretty good idea of what I was going to get when I walked into the cinema and I got almost exactly what I expected. Therefore, I cannot say this movie was bad when I knew what I was getting into. However, I am puzzled by people's response to this movie. Majority of the reviews I seen for this film, more or less, follow the lines of ""Robots+Monsters=BADASS!!!"" and while agree with that statement to an extent, I have to play Devil's advocate here and raise the point, that while giant robots and monsters are badass, those factors do not necessarily make a great movie.<br/><br/>My criticisms of the movie: <br/><br/>1. Very little character development: while we're given brief back stories to our main protagonists, they are so brief it feels like the film is just trying to get them out of the way for more action. Some characters are given no development at all. Come to think of it, we never find out why Robert Kazinsky is so cranky in this movie. <br/><br/>2. You already know the main plot just from watching the trailer: big robots seek to destroy monsters, robots win, monsters lose. End. I actually found the subplot involving the scientist trying to hook his brain to the monsters more interesting than this. <br/><br/>3. Not enough Ron Perlman: I'm sure another online critique said something very similar, but anyway, I agree. <br/><br/>4. Too long: for a film with such a simple plot, it runs too long. While I was not going ""Come on! When will this movie end already?!"" I did find myself checking my watch now and again. <br/><br/>And its these 4 factors, in my opinion, that make this film over-hyped. Like I said, its not bad, but a 7.7 rating is being FAR too generous. All because a movie has giant robots and monsters, doesn't necessarily make it a great film. <br/><br/><ul><li>Stephen</li></ul>"

","Short, sweet, and to the point:<br/><br/>This movie is a visual feast. Gloriously violent, loud, and breathtakingly gorgeous and grotesque, Pacific Rim delivers in ways I've not often seen in a blockbuster film before. <br/><br/>It is, however, one of the worst stories for a film I've ever seen, and has some of the most wooden acting ever recorded on film. Idris Elba, about halfway through the movie, seems to realize that the script just isn't getting better, and turns into a caricature of his character from his guest stint on The Office - and I feel horrible for him, because he deserves so much better.<br/><br/>But the worst...the absolute worst thing was whatever accent the lead actor decided to use in this film. I can only assume it was supposed to be a north eastern US accent - however, it sounded like he had only ever had the accent described to him, rather than hearing it himself. <br/><br/>Still, see this film in theaters, if for no other reason than to tell your eyes you love them. Just don't expect anything resembling a deep thought from the script."
"teatimexxl","5","1","6","28 July 2013"," A movie about how Jaegers suck at fighting... (Spoilers are kept to the minimum, if there even are any)
","The movie's amazingly detailed graphics and the top-notch sound (soundtrack included) couldn't entirely hide the fact that the depicted robots (Jaegers) suck badly at their primary purpose, namely kicking monsters' (Kaijus) behind.<br/><br/>If you see what complex ninja-style moves the robot pilots are trained to execute and what of it they actually apply in the combat, you would think that their time would be much better spent on the cardio bike to improve the pedal-boat-like steering of the Jaegers. The Jaegers pilots' weapon of choice is usually boxing as well as Greco-Roman wrestling and only on a rare occasion something more effective, like built-in piercing weapons, will be used. The Kaijus in contrast do not hesitate to go directly for the head with all means possible. Also, due to the pilots' superb theoretical combat skills ( e.g. ""51 drops - 51 kills"" in the simulator ) the movie makers must have chosen to show rather unlucky days for the Jaegers, for which we rarely get few minutes (or sometimes seconds) to get emotionally attached. The double-teaming on Kaijus is as well yet to be discovered by Jaeger pilots.<br/><br/>As a bottom line, one wishes that the movie makers would have invited King Kong, who fought miles more spectacular and gloriously than any of the Jaegers. AND, we could actually see it better, since in Pacific Rim you will rarely have any orientation in the fights, due to the rapid change of the view, dark surroundings and almost no zoomed-out perspectives.<br/><br/>So, don't get a false impression of the film's average rating: it is given on the scale of World War Z rating and not the films like District 9. But if you don't care about the above flaws and just want to see big monsters get punched in the face, then the Pacific Rim is definitely your movie."
"thefadingcam","6","1","6","25 July 2013"," The tribute is there, but in the end Pacific Rim cannot stand out
","I was very surprised to see that a movie with a concept like Pacific Rim where humans build giant robots to fight giant creatures that emerge from the ocean had such a positive reception, critics included. Seeing that it was directed by the brilliant Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) this really could be a rare quality entertaining movie. Del Toro wanted to make a tribute to classic monster movies like the original Godzilla and the feel is all there, even with his neo-psychedelic signature we all subtly enjoy. But essentially the question is if these movies were even good to begin with. Unfortunately, the result is just average. The plot and its presentation are not original at all, feeling that we are watching an average 90's movie. The characters are stereotypes, etc, etc, so there really isn't much to see here. And Rinko Kikuchi is probably the worst and most annoying actress ever. What's good in here is that, although this is a traditional commercial movie, the fight scenes are really awesome and very fun to watch, plus the special effects are incredible. It's a pity we have such a long and sometimes boring build up before all the action. You will have a good time, but Pacific Rim is what it is: a standard summer blockbuster with some glimpses of quality that really can't stand out."

Well you will get plenty of that in this movie. Just when I thought this movie is coming close to an end it throws more stuff at the audiences but in a good way. When it comes to robots beating the crap out of stuff, the more the better as long as the story and effective cause is in motion. The story isn't anything gripping or emotional but it gets the job done for the most part. And the build up to the main battle might be a bit slow after the intro but the direction is good enough for the wait. The cast is alright with Charlie Hunnam being the weakest despite him being the main character, he is kinda bland in this movie. He just sort of reminded me of Jax Teller from ""Sons of Anarchy"" even the way he walks. This is a entertaining big movie that I wouldn't mind there being a sequel for. From Guillermo del Toro who directed this movie, claims there is still a lot of ideas he wanted to use but didn't have the budget for or fit the structure.

"FilmMuscle","7","1","6","19 July 2013"," A colossal summer blockbuster that can rightfully be called ""epic""
","After the masterpiece that was Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy installments, Guillermo Del Toro (who's one of the most capable filmmakers in the industry today) has launched his first mega- blockbuster that rivals the grandness and intensity of Michael Bay's Transformers franchise itself. Now, from hearing about it and viewing the trailers left and right, Pacific Rim seemed frighteningly similar to the Transformers films, and I began to doubt the quality that'd shape the movie. Thus, my expectations weren't particularly as high as they could be. On that note, I'm here judging Pacific Rim as a full-fledged action blockbuster and nothing else. I won't be comparing it to thought-provoking dramas or hilarity-ensuing comedies. No, I'll be comparing it to action flicks, especially the Transformers series and how it actually far excels the quality of those movies. <br/><br/>First of all, Pacific Rim is epic in every sense of the word (though I've used that word far too excessively at this point). Its scale is colossal- beyond that of almost any summer blockbuster that has preceded it. The film promises intense and grandiose battles between gargantuan monsters and mechs/robots, and it absolutely delivers on that. Once you're engaged in one of these fights, you're able to witness the spectacular audio that erupts from the speakers as every hit taken booms in your ear as if the whole event is real. This is also meshed with the terrific soundtrack that complements the grandeur and ""larger-than-life"" feel of the movie. <br/><br/>With that being said, above all the other ""pros"" of this movie, there's the breathtaking visuals that few summer blockbusters can actually compare to. Seeing the colorful streets of Hong Kong and then eyeing the water splashing as a lizard fights a gigantic mech nearby delivers such a visual spectacle that anyone would feel highly satisfied with. Of course, this experience is even more wonderful if you're watching it in IMAX 3D (the way I wisely chose to see it). At moments, it actually feels like you're underwater in the deep bowels of the ocean and whatnot. There is no doubt that the production value of Pacific Rim is incredible, and that'd just be an understatement. <br/><br/>On top of that, there's the human aspect of the film (similar to that of the Transfomers films), which is filled with great acting, especially from Idris Elba who I must say steals the show. Everyone who's seen him on The Wire already knows what this exceptional actor is capable of. Anyways, there's a fair amount of comedy provided as well from the likes of Charlie Day and Ron Pearlman, and this time, it's actually funny. Ron Pearlman plays an arrogant tough guy by the name of Hannibal Chau, and he's just one of the other high points of the film. But then, there's the main character of the film, Travis Beckett (played by Charlie Hunnam), who's just kind of a bland individual with little personality, which is why it's easy to see how great the supporting characters are around him. <br/><br/>As you can see, this is where I have a little bit of complaints to state about the film. Since this is another Hollywood blockbuster, you can't be too surprised when you witness the fair share of clichés that fill the movie with the generic bully fights and rescues, etc. This is what diminished the satisfaction received from the ending- it's that it ended the way you would expect it to end; yet another predictable Hollywood action flick. And as we all well know, the ending is one of the most important elements of a film, and when a film ends typically, it just doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Then, there's the pacing, which seems to suffer midway through the movie as you begin to notice that the film is dragging out a little, and some are probably checking the time at that point. <br/><br/>Also, ignoring the special-effects audio, due to so many characters with accents in the film, it's often difficult to hear what those characters are even talking about, which messes up the story for me; at times, I felt confused as to what exactly is supposed to transpire. Furthermore, as an action movie and nothing more, Pacific Rim, without a doubt, delivers, but its not-too-memorable ending and abundant Hollywood clichés doesn't make it as decent as it could've been. Nonetheless, I highly advise anyone interested in action flicks (especially since the past year's blockbusters like Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel have been mediocre) to see the film in IMAX 3D, and only then will you appreciate it and understand what a proper action movie should truly be like."

","Took my grandson to see this movie because I thought he would like it and I saw that the critics thought it was worth seeing. It started out right, character back story, monsters, robots etc. But about halfway through it deteriorated into this muttled, mindless, silly movie with two of the most annoying characters since Transformers Revenge of the Fallen silly robot cars. They were so annoying that I wanted both of them to die. I also really hated the ending I really thought that the people they let die were arbitrary and a little stupid. The movie also didn't leave itself anywhere to go if the studio (like most of them) was looking toward a sequel."

I can't say the same with the actors though. Their acting was okay (I'm not saying that they are a bad actors) it's just that the actors tends to overacting and it made me lower my points for this movie. The story was quite good, the explanation of why the robots are exist is well explained. I cant seem to find emotions between actors, between actors & robots. There's one scene that make me smile a bit. This scene is a scene I've seen in Independence Day movie, I was like WTF. Overall this movie is good for entertainment, lots of fight, robots and monsters but it lack of the quality.

","This film is unoriginal inside and out. This film is a whirlpool that has sucked so many ideas from its obvious precursors (Godzilla, Transformers) and related works (Hellboy, Matrix, Aliens, Starship Trooper, Iron Man, Inception, District 9, the list is endless) that one expects it to be drowned in writs.<br/><br/>This film has a script that is as poor as you'd come to expect. It isn't horrendous, but it often arrests the cast.<br/><br/>The plot problems are few but marked. Some would not escape a child. <br/><br/>So why can I still remember the film after the popcorn is finished?<br/><br/>There is enough humour to cover the dialogue shortcomings, enough detail to keep you appreciative and seen in IMAX the carnage is sumptuous. The cinematic and visual symbolism from Del Torro is a cut above the usual fare.<br/><br/>There are a few political ideas that creep to the surface. The film effectively excludes Europe from the plot - a definite message about the future. One solution to the problem of monster terrorism is to build a large wall and tell people they will be safe behind it. <br/><br/>But what makes this movie more than the sum of its parts is the focus on the robots. This film is a clean homage to so many of the ideas that came before it, but they are fully supported by the characters who are purely there to do battle with monsters in large robots. Very little screen time is given over to any concept that isn't related to FIGHTING MONSTERS IN VERY LARGE ROBOTS. <br/><br/>And ultimately this enlarges the film, because the action sequences are the heart and sole, not sections of a script written just for the video game. There is no message to discern beyond FIGHTING MONSTERS IN VERY LARGE ROBOTS is a thing."
"Quebec_Dragon","6","1","6","17 July 2013"," Modern Giant robots vs Godzillas?
","I can't believe this actually got financed and made. It's like a geek boy's dream and it has no big name actors. You basically have giant monster-beasts coming out through a dimensional breach in the Pacific Ocean (hence the title), trying to destroy a world that fights back by uniting and creating giant robots (or mecha) piloted by humans. The war seems to be mostly won because of these until new, more dangerous monsters start coming out years later at a faster frequency. At that time, only a few giant robots remain in fighting shape, the rest being destroyed or decommissioned, with less than a dozen pilots remaining. The end is near unless something drastic happens.<br/><br/>So, most people will want to watch this because of the spectacular giant robots versus giant monsters fights, and it certainly delivers, but with some caveats. The monsters look great, even real, and not corny at all as in most Godzilla-type movies (no rubber suit here). However, near the end, they become harder to differentiate and I didn't always know who was who. They changed the red blood to some blue glow-in-the-dark blood. The monsters being alien, it makes sense and avoids making things too bloody. The monsters lack personality and are just portrayed as destructive beasts, but I won't hold that against the creators. The robots look cool and have an imposing physical presence despite the near-constant avoidance of showing them next to humans for scale. They didn't look that much computer-generated to me although I knew they were. The robots and monsters looked their size (massive) because of their ponderous, slower than real-life movements, as well as the sound effects that were excellent. The fights themselves were enjoyable and didn't overstay their welcome. I didn't suffer from action fatigue as when fights last too long without real stakes. However, because of close-ups, fast editing and lots of rain, it wasn't always clear what was going on, so the action could have been better. I did love it though.<br/><br/>Story-wise, the creators do provide an explanation that makes some sense for this monster invasion. I would even quality the story as interesting although a bit predictable although the accents were sometimes difficult to understand. It's a shame most of the secondary characters were not really developed because they looked interesting. One of my most memorable moments involved a ""flashback"" involving a little girl running away from a giant monster (she acted so well). Acting was acceptable with the highlight being Idris Elba as the Marshall. Most emotional dramatic moments unfortunately did not really connect with me except for the stuff involving the Marshall and the Japanese woman. The b-story involving 2 eccentric scientists wasn't really great, nor was it particularly funny although it tried to. It was good for a change of pace though.<br/><br/>For some realistic, amazing-looking ""live-action"" giant robot versus giant monsters that don't look fake, this is great stuff. It doesn't look cartoony, it's not corny and you don't need to be a total geek to enjoy it. Don't watch if you're allergic to the subject matter though. I'm a geek and I probably liked the movie more because it reminded me of some great mecha anime (such as Neon Genesis Evangelion) without really looking like it.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)"

","Welcome to the ultimate giant monster and mecha fanboy's dream come true. A mysterious rift under the pacific ocean allows giant monsters (termed ""Kaiju"") to enter our world. When conventional weaponry proves ineffective, the Jaeger programme was launched to create massive metal titans with the sole purpose of protecting earth's surviving cities. As years pass, the war shifts. A stalemate turns into a losing battle as each subsequent monster seems to evolve to better tackle Earth's defenses. With the Jaeger programme at risk of being discontinued, and a startling revelation about the nature of the monsters, Marshall Pentecost (leader of the programme) brings in former pilot Raleigh Backett for a perilous final strike against the Kaiju. Now Backett must learn to work with his new pilot partner Mako Mori, as well as the last of different country's Jaeger teams, and literally ""cancel the apocalypse"".<br/><br/>Yes, we have seen this plot before many times. It is Independence Day. It is Battleship. It is every single alien invasion/end of the world scenario. You have people of clashing personalities made to work together, the hot headed rookie, the cynical veteran, charismatic military leader, racial stereotypes, everything. Yet with the giant monsters and mecha, Director Guillemo Del Toro not only gives a fresh take on a tired old genre, but he ups the ante on action and entertainment. Pacific Rim is steeped in a palpable air of hopelessness as seen in the increasingly brutal beatings the Jaegers take at the hands of the Kaiju. To realise these battles, the special effects by ILM and Legacy Effects are flawless, realistic and breathtaking to behold. Action is awesome, epic in scale and scope.<br/><br/>The creative team tackled the film with the mind of a fanboy. For instance, the numerous monsters seen are obvious homages to famous monster movies of old and new. A lumbering beast that moves like a fat ape is no doubt a homage to King Kong. This crustacean based Kaiju seems to evoke memories of a monster from the Godzilla films called Ebirah. And an agile, skinny, long armed creature with parasites on its skin seems to be a reference to the similarly designed monster from the movie Cloverfield. Other references to the winged Rodan, split tailed King Ghidorah and more abound. The Jaegers themselves seem to reflect qualities of their countries of origin with Russia's looking like a nuclear cooling tower and America's having a typical superman physique with it's wide chest and ""Y"" shaped body.<br/><br/>Still, beneath all the eye candy and behind the seemingly unoriginal plot lies some rather unique themes rarely expounded upon in film. We delve into some philosophy of war with regards to the Jaegers being on the losing side. When a weapon fails, is it the fault of the weapon or the one using the weapon? And what about hope? Can hope truly unite people of different ideals?The Jaeger are piloted by two pilots who have to be joined through what is called the ""Neural handshake"". The pilots, be it complete strangers, best of friends, brothers or father and son open themselves up to each other and share their most intimate memories and everything that makes each individual who they are. They can feel each other's pain if one is hurt, they know what each other is thinking. They become ""one"" and work as one, connected physically, mentally and emotionally. This concept is very similar to a deep concept about the nature of love. Brotherly love, family love, romantic love, it is all about that connection between individuals. This film is a clever metaphor for such a connection. It is a movie about love without any actual physical display of romance: Not a single kiss in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Who needs sappy romance anyway when you have such ""larger than life"" characters. All of them are given little character arcs that are developed fully. A champion learning respect for his superiors, a father letting go of his child to walk her own path, a soldier nursing scars of the past, all of them come to satisfactory resolution. Idris Elba steals the show as the bada55 commander Pentecost. His performance is so memorable, as is his ""cancelling the apocalypse"" speech repeated in almost every trailer. Oh, and the almighty Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau, the leader of a black market syndicate selling Kaiju parts is marvellously cast in this surprising role. Special mention also goes to Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who are hilarious as the bickering Doctors Newton and Gottleib. Incidentally, it is the side characters that end up more memorable than our main characters. Rinko Kikuchi does her best but her command of English makes her character Mako Mori's dialogue sounds almost dubbed in some scenes. But the low point of the show is Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Backett whose monotone droning narration just comes across as bad acting.<br/><br/>Well, nothing can be perfect. A more original soundtrack would have benefited this show though. Ramin Djwadi does instill the Kaiju themes with a classic giant monster movie feel but the rest of the soundtrack sounds like a retread of Iron Man with its electric guitar and heavy metal vibe. Still, Pacific Rim no doubt succeeded at what it intended to do. Guillermo Del Toro took two floundering genres and gave them a much needed face lift in the minds of movie going audiences everywhere. Mecha CAN be realised in live action, convincingly and awesomely without power ranger style puppetry. Giant Monsters can be taken seriously with none of that rubber suit crap. Pacific Rim also brings hope of more original screenplays and actually world-building in an industry dominated by movies based on pre-existing franchises."

","A movie of this nature would be regarded as a ""cheesy, plot less flick"" filled with just clumsy action scenes that really have no basis. However, after I got out of the cinema I could not get over how pumped I felt.<br/><br/>In all honesty this movie makes for an action packed summer blockbuster that deserves appraisal and excels in an intricate plot line as well as pure fist-pumping thrill when it comes to Monsters vs. Machines. After all the majority of us miss out on movies that are on such a high scale proportion such as Godzilla and Jurassic Park and it seems that directors and producers shun these movies due to the fear that they may not achieve success. Big props to Guillermo del Toro for making the movie come to life as well as solid performances from the lead cast such as Idris Elba as well as Charlie Hunnam which really puts together a solid blockbuster that is worthwhile to watch."

","I saw trailers before and was hopeful.<br/><br/>What I got was a knock-down awesome robot vs. monster movie. I wasn't looking for the next Transformers (though I really liked the first one, less with the dogs and teenage awkwardness and more with the robots), I wasn't looking for a Coppola/North best written screenplay like ""Patton"", I wasn't looking for a dramatic Oscar-winning performance of ""English Patient"" (which I fell-asleep in a few times because of boredom) I wasn't expecting great cinematography or musical score...but the graphics, CGI and music turned out to be effective and quite good.<br/><br/>If you went (or will go) expecting the next cinematic masterpiece like ""Dances with Wolves"", or a classically written and well acted ""Casablanca"" you're going for the wrong reasons. This is Die Hard (1, not 5...5 was a disgrace to the Die Hard name), this is Rocky (again 1, or 2), this movie is a little Real Steel with more fighting, and monsters, but without all the cheesy crap.<br/><br/>It was awesome! Thrilling and just a great remake (and a better make) of movie combo: classic cartoons and monster movies. If this movie had come out when I was a boy, 20 odd years ago, I probably would have seen it 10 times at the theater, bought the movie and then watched it at least once-a-week till I wore out the tape. It's not the wussy Power Ranger crap.<br/><br/>The things I liked: Robots, monsters, robots and monsters fighting, technology. Big machines, big machine sounds. Big cool robots and big cool robot sounds smashing big gruesome, maniacal alien monsters hell-bent on destruction.<br/><br/>****** Spoiler Alert ****** The plot, simple? Yes very. Often predictable outcomes. The acting was average. The writing didn't help the average acting.<br/><br/>I saw it in a foreign country so I'm not sure if the audio was goofed but when Mako meets Raleigh her lips were speaking Japanese but audio was English and he answered in-kind and the only subtitles I got were in the foreign language (not Japanese or English). I don't know if that was intentional, you know the old Samurai movies where the actors were speaking Japanese but audio was English voice-overs. If so now that I think about it, it could be pretty funny.<br/><br/>Please stop with all the ""Battle Speeches"" Idris did a great job in the movie overall but those last-stand battle speeches were finished in Braveheart (yes that was 1995).<br/><br/>But I loved the Voltron-esque (or that era of genre robot movies) and Godzilla-esque references."

","Giant monster vs giant robot blockbuster movie? sounds that it will be somekind of a transformers movie. Wait... it's directed by Guillermo Del Toro? I should consider to watch this because this could be AWESOME. And my decision was right to watch this, money and time well spent, this movie is a lot of fun. The characters were good, the acting was also quite well done, and don't even ask about the action? It's Spectacular! Well actually to be honest some of the actors were kind of over the top, but that's actually quite make sense. The action was not like transformers, it's very much better. This comes from a director can actually frame the action up, unlike Michael Bay that just puts action and action and explosions and we don't even know what's happening in the movie because it's not well done. Don't even dare to compare this to Transformers, because comparing Pacific Rim to Transformers is like comparing Jurassic Park to Theodore Rex. One of the best things about the movie is it's not just action, the characters are also important and interesting in this movie. We do care about the characters. Only very few directors that can pull this kind of movie off, this just proves how good Guillermo Del Toro is, as a director."

","I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and let me just say, that's the way you need to see it! First and foremost, the reason I knocked it down to 8/10 is because the plot, to me, was pretty weak/standard. I mean, comon.... they just arbitrarily throw in the whole, ""they jump planet to planet......"" you can fill in the rest, it's cheesy. Also, the emotional story they weaved in was kind of weak in my opinion. I found myself saying, ""ok that's nice, now lets get back to the action!"" every time they tried to build the emotional side of things. I guess it's necessary for some people, not me.<br/><br/>Now the good stuff.<br/><br/>The attention to detail in the Jaegers is amazing! The effects were second to none and the detail in the Kaijus was also fantastic! The battle sequences..... oh my god.... just plain awesome! Luckily there were only a few people in the theater since I saw it on the earliest showing of the day because I found myself saying out loud, ""GET SOME"" a few times. I couldn't resist! This movie was just flat out amazing! I would strongly recommend this movie if you want some great action sequences and a fairly high octane movie. If you're looking for a in depth plot/storyline and a deep seeded love story, steer clear since these things seem like afterthoughts so your girlfriend or wife don't completely hate the movie."

","I saw the movie last night in 3D. Wished I'd seen it 3D IMAX....however, it was just too expensive...Damm !!<br/><br/>Anyways, it's a brilliant film to say the least. When it comes to a film of robots...this is the best film I've ever seen. Transformers series is nowhere close which I started to feel is plain dumb !!<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is overall a typical underdog story. But Del Toro gives it a heart and soul through story telling and special effects. He also keeps the sentiment level at minimum and focuses on the action. <br/><br/>Another wise thing he does that he casts not so famous actors and hence the audience focuses on the action and not on acting. The action set pieces are breath taking and the scene of young Rinko with a Kaiju gave me goosebumps.<br/><br/>The climax is short and not lengthy like Man of Steel and there wasn't a single bore moment. Compared to Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel which had high emotional quotient.....this was perfect. A must watch !!"

","When I first saw the trailer, I really thought this movie was going to be a very bad one. The trailer made it seem like one of those movies without a story, the only thing that looked decent were the special effects.<br/><br/>I saw it in a sneak preview so I didn't know what movie to expect but then I recognized it from the trailer. From then on the movie begins and I still don't know whether to think it is a good movie or not<br/><br/>The intro really hyped me up even while the trailer made it look like the movie was going to suck. I was really overwhelmed by the whole experience, the music, the special effects and the acting. The story started to progress and I liked it, just non-stop action, science fiction and epic robots fighting huge insane monsters. The only thing that I didn't really like about the movie was the fact that nearly all the action was in dark places or during the night.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anybody who is into good action movies and science fiction, any guy could probably enjoy it."

","The previews for this film, frankly, had pretty much turned me off. I expected more over the top CGI effects with dreary dialog and a forgettable cast. Thank goodness my AC went out and I chose to seek refuge at the air conditioned cinema. The film's pace was quick and the story line tantalizing enough to hook me. The CGI effects were, of course, there in robust abundance, but - and this was what won my heart - they didn't steal the show from the human drama in the film. The characters are likable and even inspirational. No, these are not vastly deep characters a la Ingmar Bergman; they're more like the characters one used to find in the westerns by directors like John Ford and Howard Hawks. The heroes are archetypes, and the film takes on the qualities of a modern age myth. And to top it off, the film is a lot of fun, too. My hat's off to Guillermo del Toro."

Seriously it was that great in all aspects. The colors looked great the acting was incredible and the scenery was well done. Then there was the other characters the 2 scientists can make anyone uncomfortable they lack charm. They were just not there (not connected to the movie at all). Another thing I noticed is that it is too long. The Movie is just too long and began getting more and more less interesting. I fell asleep twice watching it (didn't want to say it but had to). Overall the Movie is a 7.5 out of 10. I have to give it a 7.5 for that scene alone but it then started to loose depth. Guillermo del Toro could've done a better job in giving more depth to the movie and to the characters. The special effects were out of this world but like I said it lacks charm, that warmth."
"mossfoot","10","1","7","15 July 2013"," Giant robots, done right. Was that so hard?
","Granted I went into Pacific Rim hoping to enjoy it, but keep in mind that with me that actually means a greater chance of disappointment.<br/><br/>Which I was not.<br/><br/>Does the world in which Jagers exist make a lick of sense? No. How on earth does punching Kaiju with giant metal fists make more sense than launching Tomahawk missiles at them (my nerdling explanation here is that the radioactive nature of the creatures prevent long range weapons from working properly, but still) Fact is, if that is the kind of detail that is a deal breaker for you, then you are way too nitpicky and will not enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>But. If you are the kind of person who grew up a fan of Godzilla movies, or Japanese Giant Robot cartoons (not Robotech but the Grandzier variety) or hell, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, I can't see how you won't love this movie.<br/><br/>Personally I fall in the middle category. Was never big into Godzilla and was a bit too old for Power Rangers when it first came out, but those Giant Robot cartoons with the superhero like super science? I dug it. Granted when Robotech came along I vastly preferred the slightly more realistic/militaristic approach, and if anything that is the middle ground Pacific Rim falls into.<br/><br/>Plot wise we're talking a straight forward story. You have the invasion scenario, you have the military response, you have teams of pilots. Characterization is done fine, but a problem I think some people have is that they're expecting TOO much from Del Toro, as if he's not just suppose to do better than Transformers but give us a deep window to the human condition with giant robots punching monsters as window dressing.<br/><br/>Let's put this movie in it's proper place. It's Top Gun. It's Star Wars. It's The Matrix without the psudo-philosophy and impossible human battery science in favour of impossible giant robot science. That's the kind of movie you're going to watch. To quote an oft-used internet meme: it ain't Citizen Kane. Nor is it supposed to be.<br/><br/>Only one character I actively thought was full on super-cliché and that was the Iceman clone (though what happens at the end with him is better). Ron Pearlman is perhaps underused, but it's always great to see him show up.<br/><br/>I was also surprised how I didn't mind the 3D effects. I'm not a fan of 3D (didn't have a choice in the matter), but this worked fine in that medium. It was obvious when it needed to be and wasn't when it didn't. Still not worth paying extra for, but usually there are moments where the 3D bugs me and this didn't have any of them.<br/><br/>If I were to go into geek mode I could nitpick the hell out of it, as I alluded to before. But where Del Toro succeeds is that I didn't want to. I was too busy enjoying myself, and wishing I could see more of this world. My major complaint is that it was too short – by about ten hours.<br/><br/>What I mean is this would have been great as a series rather than a movie, to flesh out more of the characters and give the consequences more weight. Heck, so much backstory is just hinted at in the first half hour, showing the early years of the Kaiju war, I would have loved to have seen more of that as well. Or watching them effectively become independent contractors when they lose their funding. And more time to get to know the pilot teams. Because even action movies can have characters that are developed enough for you to care about what happens to them, and I don't think this movie had enough time to do that for some of them.<br/><br/>Taken for what this is, this succeeded where Hollywood almost always fails.<br/><br/>Giant robots, done right. Was that so hard?"

","Not a fan of blockbuster movies, I was dragged to see this by some friends. In the first part of the movie I was pleasantly surprised. The scenes were visually beautiful and the plot was interesting. It will still require lot of suspension of disbelief because the basic premise, that the most efficient method of killing giant animals is constructing giant robots to punch them, is ridiculous. If you can accept this, the movie will be very enjoyable...<br/><br/>...at least until the Hong Kong base part. We'll meet a lot of characters there who are best described as caricatures. They are single-dimensional and their interactions are forced and annoying. I hold two hysterical scientists and all the Jaeger pilots in this group. The altercations between the main character and another pilot, and between the main character and the general are grating. They can only appeal to 10-year olds in the audience and their idea of how Real Tough Men act like.<br/><br/>Fortunately the female lead makes up for this by being an original and interesting character (unlike her male counterpart), and a knife-wielding Ron Perlman would be beneficial to any movie. They will help the transition to the final fight.<br/><br/>In conclusion, not a masterpiece but a decent monster-robot blockbuster."

The fight scenes between the monsters and the Robots were great you could really feel the scale of them. And they weren't pulling any punches, these fight scenes go on for awhile so we get a lot of screen time with these Goliath dueling it out. I loved the outlandish premise. In a movie where giant Monsters attack constantly, you can have a scene where a character Mind Melds with a piece of alien brain, or a character cuts himself out of a creature's stomach. Its B movie ideas with A movie budgeting, and I for one LOVED it. I felt like I was watching a good TOHO Godzilla movie. I was interested in the giant fights, but also on the human characters as well. They inserted a lot of back-story and character development for a Giant Robot Fighting movie. Del Toro is a good storyteller.<br/><br/>I was also impressed with the ending. As a Del Toro fan I have to admit that his films can usually have a weak or confusing ending. This is not the case here. He ends the movie at the right time, and he doesn't leave any loose ends. Pacific Rim is not the deepest or most thoughtful movie that you will ever see, but it is immensely entertaining, and if you are looking for an action movie that will keep you interested and on the end of your seat I would suggest watching this movie. The bar has been set high for the New Godzilla movie next year."

","When I first heard about this movie a while ago, I was intrigued. Then when I first saw the trailer I had to see it! Well, I saw it the other day, and I have to say I liked this movie a lot. But in saying that, the dialogue was average, and the attempted ""Aussie"" accents in this movie were quite bad to say the least (especially as I lived in Aussie for 20 years). Also, the story isn't that ground breaking either - Alien beings attack Earth, the Human race has to overcome them in order to survive. And yes some of the acting and characters left a lot to be desired BUT, in saying all this, the reason I found this movie to be very entertaining is because of the action sequences, because of the monsters, and because of the Robots! I was like a child again watching this, and I also got to see this movie in full 3D glory! The film was visually stunning in my opinion, and that was the main reasons behind me putting aside the other inadequacies throughout this movie. Some of the fight scenes were very well done too, especially the main fight between the Jaeger known as ""Gypsy Danger"" and the monster called ""Otachi"" in Victoria Harbour. If you want to see a movie that has great acting and a great storyline, then this isn't that movie, but if you want to see a very entertaining movie that you can take your kids to and feel like a kid again, then this is for you.

"aharmas","10","1","7","14 July 2013"," Finally and Exciting Summer Film
","What's to say about ""Pacific Rim""? I LOVED IT!! For starters, here's a film with a really good story that doesn't pander to us and refrains from those ""way too clever"" moments where we supposed to admire the wit of the production team while everything else in the production wasn't done with care, intelligence and love. In here, we can see those amusing bits. The word ""shoe"" comes to mind. ""Pacific Rim"" entertains, keeps you engaged, while looking for fresh new approaches, and at the same taking time to honor the best of past adventure and science fiction past, paying plenty of tribute to those ""Godzilla"" films that were both scary and ridiculous while we were little kids. Someone tried to make a really exciting one a few years ago, but they messed up with the formula. Del Toro brings back those beasts, spices it up with a bit of ""Aliens"", ""Predators"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Blade Runner"", and the mix is explosive and cool.<br/><br/>The story takes us into the near future, as the world is now exposed to the worst enemy. Something colossal in size that can cause enormous amounts of destruction, and that can be stopped at a great cost. Things become more complicated for humanity when it becomes obvious the beasts are learning and are literally more vicious than anything we have ever encountered, fully capable of fighting and destroying in just about every possible setting, from deep oceans, to land, to air.<br/><br/>There is emphasis on the importance of bond and memory, and some people might wince at the mere mention of it, but just thinking about it of those moments that serve as the way we develop a bit of interest on who these people might be instead of just looking at them as background decorations, expendable and boring. I can name a few films where that has been the problem, and we're talking about poorly developed situations and characters.<br/><br/>Also, remember to have good actors. Del Toro went back to pick up some of his usual associates for these, and he recruited a few fresh faces without making it look like a novelty. He has plenty of fun blending the best elements of boxing, kick boxing, fencing, nuclear weaponry, and just plain dirty fighting, and you need it with these creatures because they have absolutely no qualms about turning the robots into shredded metal and humans into ground beef.<br/><br/>Grab some popcorn, or whatever you like to enjoy while having a great time and enjoy an exciting time at the movies."

Monsters/aliens from another dimension have come to Earth when the environment was just right to wipe out the humans and claim the land.

There was one scene that I teared up over. I won't give too much away but it has to do with Mako Mori's character. The lines were cheesy but the movie had better character drive than any Michael Bay film has ever had. I really cared what happened to the characters.<br/><br/>The action was sometimes hard to tell who was fighting who.

First off: This is totally a bro movie, and not one to bring your timid ladyfriend to. <br/><br/>If you were a fan of Godzilla as a child, this will delight you all the way through. Once you accept the likeliness of a inter- dimensional rift opening in the ocean floor, the rest of the plot seems logical.

The concept of two pilots synchronizing memories to better-control these 30 story beasts creates some human aspect to the intense, explosive, and city-leveling destruction. <br/><br/>There was a subtle hint of humor too, between the the two Kaiju-obsessed doctors and a cocky Kaiju- organ dealer, so the film had a well-balanced sense of humor/seriousness. <br/><br/>The movie almost was ruined for me at the end, as I braced for the main protagonists, male and female, to do the cliché, ""we won this together"" kiss, but that thankfully never came. <br/><br/>And to those complaining about CGI, how would you go about bringing these mechanical monsters and colossal creatures to life?<br/><br/>A NOTE TO VIEWERS: This was the loudest freaking movie I have ever seen, so those prone to having sensitive ears may want to ready themselves!"
"YJLcool","8","1","7","13 July 2013"," the most entertaining live-action mecha VS kaiju film to date
","Pacific Rim is the most entertaining live-action mecha VS kaiju film to date. The premise is simple and unpretentious. The film honours the origins of the genre, it doesn't try to be something else and delivers on its promise. The fight between Kaiju and Jaegers are clear clean-shot action sequences, no shaky-cam, extreme zoom-ins, 360 shots or first person viewing that would make many audience uncomfortable.The action is beautifully choreographed, executed with style and magnificence.<br/><br/>Ignore the critics' comments that the monsters or mecha shown in the film is unclear or not visible because most of the fight scenes happen at night, in the rain or underwater...because they're totally unjustified. I can clearly see them. Although no in-depth character development is provided for all of the supporting characters and there are some character issues in the film (some characters seemed to be 'specifically engineered' to serve a purpose), but the characterisation provided is sufficient enough for the audience to know them and justify their actions in the film.<br/><br/>The film didn't try to be overly serious, a pair of mismatched scientists is included to provide some comic relief.There're some plotting issues where the prologue that serves as the backstory of the war is too fast-paced and we're only shown a glimpse of the Kaiju's first contact to humanity. There's a flashback scene worth mentioning, the little girl who plays the young Mako is extremely adorable and her expressions managed to convince the audience about her traumatic experience.<br/><br/>If your childhood memories consists of Transformers, Evangelion, Mobile Suit Gundam, Godzilla, Ultraman...So why not give Pacific Rim a chance? This is a definite love letter to all the Kaiju/mecha fans out there, co-written, co-produced, directed by Del Toro himself to re-introduce this old genre back to the younger generation.<br/><br/>Review: http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/07/movie-review-pacific-rim.html http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/07/pacific-rim-kaiju-and-jaegers.html"

","PACIFIC RIM - From the first time I heard about this film many months ago. I thought nothing of it. Only recently with the word of mouth hype did I decide to go and see it. Special Effects were out of this world. The slow moving giants were perfect for 3D. The sound...amazing. The story...was a little better then alright. I didn't think there would be much of a story. Because without a story. Special Effects just become eye candy. <br/><br/>I couldn't help but think of Independence Day meets Godzilla with a little bit of Starship Troopers. Except less actors...a lot less actors. Dated...but I enjoyed ID4 a lot more. <br/><br/>No one even clapped at the end on opening night. The director still has it. But not like he use to. I enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed Hellboy 2. Just alright...better then most movies. Maybe I expected more because of the Hype. So I won't add to it. <br/><br/>But just say what I feel in my opinion. The young kids will probably like it more. Say 6-7 and up. But not the BLOCKBUSTER movie I was looking forward to. My fun of the Summer is still with Star Trek Into The Darkness for many, many reasons.<br/><br/>Want to see what I thought was a masterpiece of Guillermo del Toro's work. Treat yourself to the Spanish (Subtitles in English) film 'THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE...that should have gotten him an Oscar instead of PAN'S LABYRINTH."

","I saw ""Pacific Rim"", starring Charlie Hunnam-Sons of Anarchy-t.v., The Ledge; Idris Elba-Thor, The Losers; Rinko Kikuchi-At River's Edge, Sideways; Charlie Day-It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia-t.v., Horrible Bosses and Ron Perlman-Sons of Anarchy-t.v., the Hellboy movies.<br/><br/>This is a monsters versus giant robots movie that is directed by Guillermo del Toro-Pan's Labyrinth, the Hellboy movies. It reminded me of the old Japanese Godzilla movies that I used to watch, as a kid. Basically, it's a big budget ""B"" movie-Godzilla meets the Transformers, only there is more than just one Godzilla. The story takes place in the not too distant future-about 10 years from now-where a dimensional rift to an alien world has opened up a portal in our Pacific Ocean. The aliens are dinosaur-looking creatures that come through the portal, only a few at a time-as the years go by, they come more frequently. The governments of the world pool their resources and come up with giant robots, as a line of defense. The robots use two bonded pilots that are usually brothers or father & son, because it's easier to handle the robots. Charlie H is a veteran pilot, Idris is the boss of the robot program and Rinko is a new rookie pilot that teams up with Charlie H after he looses his brother in an earlier battle. Charlie D is a genius scientist-you have to have at least one of those-and Ron is a black market dealer that deals in alien body parts-he scavenges the bodies after fights and sells them. About one minute into the end credits, there is a scene that you should see. The movie is also being shown in 3D and IMAX 3D-that's what I saw it in. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and brief language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes. If you like giant monsters fighting giant robots, then you should like this one. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."

Also, you could not discern the robots from the dinosaurs in combat thanks to the terrible cinematography. You can't see who's winning the fight. It is schmaltz to the 10th degree. Save your money.

"Al_The_Strange","Null","1","8","12 July 2013"," ""It's 2,500 tons of awesome!""
","Pacific Rim is a sweet blend of several superb ingredients: the ambition and mass-destruction of kaiju films (such as Godzilla or Gamera), the premise and high-tech concepts of mecha anime (like Neon Genesis Evangelion), and the familiar style and imagination of Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy I and II, Pan's Labyrinth, and more). It's especially noteworthy since there has never really been any major blockbuster films that portray giant robots and giant monsters on screen together; we've always had one or the other, but it's pretty common fare for mecha anime to slam them together and make them fight. A film like this seems long overdue.<br/><br/>As expected, the action in Pacific Rim is very big and incredible. There are three major battles that pit towering machines against rampaging sea monsters from another world. Entire cities crumble within the film's prologue; in the fights that ensue, buildings get crushed, cars and trucks are thrown all over the place, and it truly seems like the world could get trampled at any moment. In between the battles, the film breathes pretty evenly, with the same playful energy that made the Hellboy movies so fun. Humor doesn't really play into it that much, but with the acting and colorful production design, this film is never all that serious or brooding; it's rather cheesy, lighthearted, over-the-top, and cartoonish. And it's fun that way.<br/><br/>It's not all about the big fights and silliness though; the film has a solid focus on storytelling. It does take some effort though. The film introduces a plethora of clever concepts behind the premise of giant robots and monsters: terms like ""drifting"" and ""neural handshake"" become integral to the plot, and if you're not digging the concept, you might get lost (having already been familiar with even deeper concepts in the Evangelion saga, I couldn't help but to draw comparisons; in spite of that, I found Pacific Rim easy to follow). Aside from that, the plot is well-structured, and it's especially refreshing to see that every battle presents new problems and situations that make things unpredictable and more intense. Characters are given diligent attention; they are colorful, but they also show some decent depth and emotion.<br/><br/>This film utilizes decent photography and editing. Acting has been criticized for being really silly, but it matches up really well with the film's overall tone and style; it even goes so far as to reinforcing the film as a live-action anime. This production uses some very big-scale and highly imaginative sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is really cool too.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim, finally, an epic movie that shows giant machines and giant beasts brawling and wreaking havoc. It's got the elements of classic kaiju monster films, robot anime, and maybe even a little hint of HP Lovecraft in the mix. It is exceptional for its worldbuilding, and I found it very immersive and impressive. However, if you're not captivated by this world, then you might just shrug it off as something silly. If you're taken by this film's concepts, then it comes heartily recommended.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"CowherPowerForever","8","1","9","15 July 2013"," A Fantastic and Epic Film
","From start to finish this film delivers fantastic action combined with a good story. Some have criticized it for being too much like Transformers where we get tons of epic action but no story and characters we don't care about. Well this movie does have the Transformers type action however the story is much more deep and the characters you actually care about.<br/><br/>The acting in this film whom is lead by the fantastic actor Charlie Hunnam is wonderful. Hunnan finally gets a big lead in a major summer movie after years of doing a great job of acting on a popular television series Sons of Anarchy. Idris Elba another great actor works with Hunnam a lot in the movie and these two make their scenes so much better. They have so much chemistry between them that it adds something special to the film. There are tons of side characters that as well do a fantastic job of making this film one of the more well acted films of the year.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro does an amazing job directing this film. The film while mostly CGI is beautiful on the big screen. This film truly comes to life right in front of your eyes and it is so wonderful to see. The shots are perfectly done and no shaky cam to worry about here. It is known del Toro was against transferring this to 3D however I'd say in my opinion the 3D adds a lot of depth to the film that makes it even better. The IMAX 3D experience of this film is also one to behold as with the giant IMAX screen(whether real or fake IMAX) you are immersed and makes the film so much better. This film should truly be watched on the giant IMAX screen.<br/><br/>Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro wrote this film together with Beacham writing the story. The writing for the most part is fantastic and fast paced meaning it moves by quickly. For the most part. And here is where one of my complainants about the film come in. I'd say after about twenty minutes or so of non stop action it cuts off to build up story. Which is perfectly fine and needed. However the film drags for too long and it is a buzz kill. Thankfully it is not over the top long and the film does pick back up and from there to the finish does not stop.<br/><br/>Music is a very important part of a film. I'm a lover of scores for films. I love listening to every soundtrack for nearly all blockbusters like this and many others as well. My only other complaint about this film is that to me the soundtrack is not that memorial. At times it is very good but I'd say for most of the film you will forget about the score and thus not leave the theater remembering anything about it.<br/><br/>In closing this is a fantastic epic summer blockbuster that while at times can slow down is overall a must see epic joyride filled with amazing action scenes that you will leave remembering for some time. The IMAX 3D experience adds so much to the experience and simply waiting to watch this movie at home would be a mistake as the experience of the giant IMAX screen is amazing. 8/10"

","If giant robots against humongous creatures sounds like a movie for you. Than this is it, your not gonna find one that's better. As a fan of that genre and director Guillermo Del Toro I can say that you won't be disappointed. That being said the film does leave a little to be desired. It centers on pilots called Jaegars who are used to pilot the giant robot suits, two to a machine. To do so they must do something called drifting enabling them to tap into each others psyches so they can power the machine together one for the right and one for the left. it's an intriguing concept solidly executed but a little underdeveloped. Although it's a whole lot of fun and surprisingly more character driven than you'd expect. The character arcs don't reach the heights that you would hope for. And the finale feels a bit rushed and not as developed as you'd hope. Still the fight scenes are phenomenal and the movie is tailor made for IMAX 3D more so than any other film recently. Besides the exciting creatures and striking visuals there are an allotment of very attractive guys piloting this film Charlie Hunnam(sons of Anarchy), Diego Klattenhoff(TV's Homeland), Idris Elba (Obsessed), Charlie Day (It's always sunny in philadelphia), Max Martini (Revenge) and the delectable Robert Kazinski (True Blood Season 6) all looking very nice in Imax 3D.And as the sole female character Rinko Kikuchi(Babel) more than holds her own and her storyline is the most engaging of the characters. There's a fare bit of cheese mixed into the proceedings as well as an expected lot of typical genre clichés but Pacific Rim is a thrilling, original sci-fi, action film that needs to be seen on the big screen! 4/5"
"fgp-mccoy","8","1","9","15 July 2013"," A very refreshing, enjoyable ride
","This movie was lot of fun! Most aspects of this film were executed extremely well, as you would expect form a Del Toro film. Visually, this is one of the best movies you will see for a while. Despite the huge scale of the fights and the scenes, it is very easy to keep up with the action, and follow what's happening, a testament to how well the movie was directed, shot and edited. <br/><br/>It is very over the top, and cliché'd in places, but it's all the better for it. This is essentially a modern day B-movie, just with big budget, good screenplay and good directing. <br/><br/>I found it very refreshing to watch a movie that for once, wasn't trying to be gritty and gloomy, and also wasn't just a re-hash of tired old ideas. New IPs and ideas like this need to be supported, rather than flocking to see yet another Spiderman or Superman film."

Charlie Hunnams performance was solid although i am a bit tired of his SAMCRO style.There are others ways to perform but who am i to argue?As for the other supporting roles make the story believable. Of course the movie has some flaws.Too much macho stuff.Could work with out them.A few clichés and cheesy stuff.But in a movie were 300 storie robots are the protagonist,unfortunately there is little room for actors performances.But they do a good job.In the end its a movie thats a classic.And perhaps Michael Bay can learn a thing or two on how you make a robot movie.Go see it.You wont regret it."

It began to drag on and the Character development was lacking and the plot was laughable. The beginning of the movie was where all the meat was contained as far as having a rich story, but Del Toro choose instead to skip over the most important part of the money as if it was just a side note. My Son became bored and dosed off in the middle of the movie as it became hard to follow. Hard to believe they would drop 185K and not have more to the movie. The best scenes were in the previews.

"generationfilm","Null","1","9","12 July 2013"," Pacific Rim- Although Conceptually Intriguing and Entertainingly Absurd Guillermo Del Toro's Latest Film Lacks Both Lasting Science-Fiction Braininess and Creative Soul
","Two words come to mind that are generally synonymous with Mexican director/writer Guillermo Del Toro, an undeniably creative auteur who has a familiarity with various pop-culture mediums, multiple mythologies, and a keen sense of original storytelling, and those words are passionate and imaginative. Whether it's the brooding vampiric mythos of his debut film Cronos, the dark escapism of his fantasy tale Pan's Labyrinth, or even the colorful superhero interpretation of the Dark Horse Comics character Hellboy there is a distinct feel, tone, and beauty that links all of his varying yet inventive pieces together. His latest passion project Pacific Rim, a blend of Japanese pop-culture influenced monster films with a live action anime intention, undoubtedly shares a great deal of characteristics a majority of his other films possess, including his odd humor deviations, impeccable detail, and a particular visual tone, and yet doesn't possess enough to distinguish itself from the rest of the summer blockbuster parade of mediocrity. Pacific Rim opens with the potential of a truly original and intriguingly conceptual work for the science-fiction genre but the film not only leaves behind the braininess early on for too much loud, abrasive brawn it also doesn't possess enough heart in the lumbering beast of a film machine to make a true link between the director's passionate fun and the audience's potential sympathetic investment. Del Toro's intentions with Pacific Rim are clearly about making pleasurable absurdity with self-consciousness towards the ridiculousness of his own premise but it is unfortunately anchored down by its stilted dialogue, inappropriate uses of humor amidst often times boring drama, and incredibly limited performances interpreting apathetically developed characters. Instead of getting a usual dose of Del Toro creativity through makeup artistry, distinct set designs, and beautifully imagined characters we've been given a rather hollow and undoubtedly dumb CGI-fest of giant monsters, giant robots, and giant destruction which for the most part is amusing though highly disappointing. Though Pacific Rim contains a myriad of blockbuster clichés they are presented in a humorously self-referential fashion through Del Toro's signature imagination but the final product feels limited by the expansive use of freewheeling special effects instead of enhanced which is the usual outcome for a majority of typical, loud, and expensive blockbuster films.<br/><br/>Read more on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-AC; read more reviews: Generationfilm.net"

"princecwiscovitch","10","1","12","15 July 2013"," Pacific Rim, GO SEE IT!!!
","This is the first time in years that I've ever seen a movie that I had so much fun that it leaves a lasting impression. From the moment I saw the trailer, I knew I was on board, since as a kid, I was( and still am) a huge fan of anime, Godzilla, and robots in general. This may make me the worst possible person to listen to, but I feel I must still give my opinion, because this is the kind of movie that we don't see to often, thanks to Hollywood thinking that if something makes money the first time, then just either make endless sequels, remake it, or just adept a comic book or something old into film. While their have been giant robot/giant monster movies in the past, this is the first time that the two have been brought to the mainstream. <br/><br/>The premise is that in 2015, a portal opens up in the pacific rim, releasing monsters known as Kaiju (japanese for great beast), from another dimension. To combat this threat after it is shown that conventional weapons and warfare can do little to stop them, the nations of the world unite and begin the Jaeger program, a program in which two pilots take control of a Jaeger (german for hunter) robot and mind meld with each other to have perfect control with of the machine. At first, the program seems to work, with more Kaiju dying, and more cities saved from destruction, until at one point of the war, more and more kaiju begin coming out of the rift, each stronger then the last, and more Jaegers being torn apart by the kaiju then they are being built. This is where our movie begins with Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), a pilot who lost his co-pilot in a battle, being sent to Hong Kong where the last four Jaegers are stored and ready to decide humanity's fate with a plan that if it success, will have the Earth saved, and if fails, will seal humanity's extinction.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is pact with great characters (though prepare to compare them to a lot of Top Gun and anime characters), a setting that really has depth, suspense that has you on the edge of your seat, visuals that are beautifully integrated, and action that puts Michael Bay's Transformers trilogy to shame. There are also some cool little touches like how the different Kaiju have are listed by category like hurricanes, the Kaiju skull in the museum at the beginning as they say the memorialized the event, the black market for dead Kaiju remains, how society and cultures view the monsters, and the Jaegers by country of origin.<br/><br/>Even though I gave away the main summery of the plot away, I want to stop right here and just say to anyone reading this that this is the best summer movie this year. The only people who I can imagine will hate this movie are either people who nit pick everything they see (trolls), or someone who looks at movies at such a serious point of view that they just dismiss it without having fun (snobs). The main point is that this movie is fun in every single way a movie with this premise can have fun, thanks in large part to Guillermo del Toro, an over looked director who knows what he's doing when making a movie and took a very big risk making this mainstream. The las two things to say is the only bad thing about this movie is it came out the same weekend as Grown Ups 2 (which I hate), so everyone is seeing the crappy Adam Sandler comedy that is unoriginal, and not the new, great Pacific rim.<br/><br/>The last thing to say is just go see it, this is what summer blockbusters are made of. Trust me, you won't regret seeing it."

","This movie is exactly what it sets itself up as; giant robots versus monsters. Said creatures are built in the vein of Godzilla, in that you can basically tell they're rubber in the more close-up fight scenes. The robots are nicely designed, and the action scenes have solid pacing and fun to them.<br/><br/>That said, the plot is rather thin, which is almost a shock considering how long it takes to get going. Idris Elba's character is the most interesting, but still is a basket of tropes that doesn't go much of anywhere. The real highlight is Ron Perlman, who is the smartest character in the film. That's not a high bar to clear, but he is ahead of the game for the most part, and is a fun presence that lends some comic aspects that the film needs.<br/><br/>But mostly this involves people inside of cockpits screaming at each other about finishing things and killing things. If that's what your game is, this is your film. It's fancy, its creatures are imaginatively designed, but it's not something that's going to give you a lot to take home with you. Its drama is only skin deep, and its character development doesn't really happen, and it drags on far too long."

Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) joins an elite corps of fighters gathered from around the globe to combat the menace. But will the strength, cooperation and scientific genius of all mankind be enough to triumph over this monstrous invasion?<br/><br/>Oscar Award-winning Director-writer Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Hellboy Series, The Blade Series) teams up with writer Travis Beacham to deliver a surprisingly successful mix of humor, spectacle, nostalgia and action in this underrated classic. Del Toro's fantasy of gigantic robots and terrifying monsters does not require mass acceptance and universal acclaim - 
in fact, his derivative opus is so well executed that it transcends its intended genre of science fiction and approaches the canon of high cinematic art. From well-written screenplay to rich thespian talent to mind-bogglingly realistic CGI effects, Pacific Rim goes well-beyond anything previously achieved with regard to the monster-movie genre. <br/><br/>Hunnam is perfectly cast as the anti-hero Raleigh, a man who would rather be doing anything than taking orders, but proves to be a powerful warrior when challenged. Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost is perfectly cast as an unmovable foil to Raleigh's hot-headed ambitions, while Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori provides a romantic interest which strikes a balance between the two 
powerful characters.<br/><br/>Monster movies have come a long way since Godzilla (1954), but the genre persists partly because of our child-like fascination with size and our fear of the unknown. Pacific Rim takes the genre further than ever before imagined by making its monsters bigger, more powerful and more intelligent, all while raising the production value of the movie to incredible standards, melding together talent, craft and skill to create a movie unlike any monster film before it.<br/><br/>Special effects, talent and cinematography notwithstanding, writer-director Guillermo del Toro has masterfully delivered a must-see monster-movie-event in Pacific Rim (2013), and as many movie goers have come to find out, the best is yet to come."

","I would love to give this 10 out of 10. Its the closest Hollywood has ever come close to realistic manga (with CGI)(AFAIK - the previous Godzilla films were too much Hollywood and not enough manga). Lets face it, the big draw of this film is big robots vs. big monsters a la the well loved Godzilla. Those parts are perfectly implemented. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEM and I'm v.critical. Where the film fails, uncommonly for Del Torro, is the effeminate screenplay and bad acting. Idris Elba & Ron Perlman are excellent but others are wishy-washy and the scientists are terrible - which I cannot believe from the guy who made the excellent Hellboy.<br/><br/>There is way way too much touchy-feely talky talky and girly stuff. The fact the film makers missed was that girly girls are not ever going to flock to giant monster/robot films. So all you managed to do was alienate the majority of the potential audience. I feel VERY VERY let down by the glaring flaws in the run-of-the-mill areas of the film-making.<br/><br/>I really hope the next film plays to its strengths - there's a big worldwide audience for that, and the potential technical achievement of 'reality' Manga is a world first."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","5 September 2016"," Pure and honest entertainment
","Having re-watched this movie, I can say with certainty that Guillermo del Toro has created something quite rare and wonderful here: an honest adventure film that in no way shies away from what it is and is none the worse for it.<br/><br/>I think that many of us saw the trailers and become excited yet hesitant because surely it couldn't be as good as we were promised. Surely the film would focus too much on the political machinations of the evil government, or too much on the romance between our protagonists. Or the action would be too blurry, or there would be too little of it. Surely this kind of movie wouldn't be allowed to be ""just"" about giant mechas fighting giant godzilla-monsters.<br/><br/>And sure, there is some talk about governments, the protagonists are a man and a woman. But it's a movie about giant mechas fighting godzilla-monsters. There's nothing impure about that. It's what the movie is, simple as that. And it is fantastic! The action scenes are phenomenal. Vibrant with colours, beautifully executed, each unique and exciting to follow, with no shaky-cam, or needless bleakness, or annoying side characters butting in with one-liners.<br/><br/>And it's more than that. There is an actual story in this film. Granted, it's a simple story about humanity rising against a common threat, with no big surprises or twists on the horizon. But, quite frankly, that's more than enough. The characters and their actors are of excellent quality, which breathes life into the story, giving it the depth it needs to elevate this film above a simple actionfest. And it does avoid or sidestep some obvious clichés quite beautifully, earning it some extra brownie points.<br/><br/>Do you like robots? Do you like monsters? Does the idea of them fighting one another excite you? Then see this film. It's all you'd ever want, and more."

Idris Elba gave a commanding performance as Stacker. Rinko Kikuchi rocked as Mako Mori. The chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi was excellent too. But I have to give special credit to Ron Perlman (who previously played in del Toro's ""Hellboy"" films) as the black marketeer Hannibal Chau who makes a living by dealing with Kaiju organs. He has style and charisma. I also loved Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb and Dr. Newton Geizler, respectively. Their chemistry was absolutely perfect and these two were just amazing. Guillermo del Toro also did a great job in his directing because I gradually became supportive of the Jaegers and every time they fought, I rooted for them to win. I became immersed into the movie. Every time a Jaeger was in trouble, I was rooting for them to get back up and fight back again. I wanted them to smash the Kaijus to pieces. Pacific Rim"" is just simply awesome. Now, it may not be for everyone, but if you love action, giant monsters, and giant robots, you'll definitely love this. Or if you're just trying to have some fun, watch this.

Robots vs. Monsters, nothing more. But it's well done, intense, with good CGI and score, good production design (Carol Spier, Cronenberg's regular) and decent acting.<br/><br/>I liked the goofy/clichéd/eccentric characters played by Burn Gorman (Gottlieb), Charlie Day (Dr. Geiszler) and Ron Perlman (Hannibal Chau). Actually, I recognized Clifton Collins Jr. as Choi and was certain he also plays the role of Gottlieb - they look absolutely like the same actor!<br/><br/>My main criticism is about Del Toro getting into the territory of George Lucas' ""It's so dense"" and Michael Bay's extreme close ups of action scenes. There's simply too much movement on the screen all the time: Rain, fog, robots and monsters in extreme close ups. It's too much for the eyes and I'm very pleased not watching the 3D version, which is probably a torture.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is slightly too long and should have ended a bit earlier - The ending is simply too much of an action/mess.<br/><br/>Overall it's a very enjoyable popcorn movie and I recommend seeing the 2D version."

","Robots, monsters and Ron Perlman. Oh my. Director Guillermo del Toro gives us the movie that we've wanted to see since we were five-years-old. In an action-packed and brilliant visual effects spectacle, we have giant robots fighting vicious monsters on Earth. As a fan of genre films who knows how to tell a great story while mixing in loud and vibrating action sequences, del Toro was the perfect person for this project. 'Pacific Rim' moves fast and will keep you on your toes until the very end. While this summer has proved that big budget action movies don't always go the distance, I'm betting that this one will.<br/><br/>We get almost twenty minutes of prologue before the title 'Pacific Rim' pops up on- screen. In the near future, a giant monster that resembles a mix of Godzilla and a dinosaur rises from beneath the ocean and destroys San Francisco. Unfortunately, this giant beast isn't the only one of its kind. Many more of these monsters, called ""Kaiju,"" begin popping up all over the globe, wreaking havoc.<br/><br/>Several years pass, and the countries of the world set aside their differences to make ""Jaegers,"" 30-story fighting robots controlled by two pilots that sit inside the massive metal structures. We meet two Jaeger pilots, the brothers Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), as they battle a powerful monster near Alaska. The secret to operating a Jaeger is for the two pilots to sync up their brains by way of something called ""The Drift,"" which completely unlocks the other's secrets and memories, so that they can use their skill sets together to defeat their foes.<br/><br/>Over time, the Kaiju adapt and get smarter, until they can now take out the Jaegers. The entire Jaeger program is being flushed down the toilet by the people in charge, to be replaced by a giant wall. (Now, if 'World War Z' taught us anything, it's that walls, no matter how tall or reinforced they are, won't stop zombies, let alone mega monsters.) However, when more and more Kaiju show up, Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) finds Raleigh and asks him to be a pilot again in one of the last four remaining Jaegers, in their final attempt to stop these monsters and save the entire planet.<br/><br/>Since an unfortunate accident in an earlier battle, Raleigh doesn't want to share his mind in the Drift with anyone – until he meets the pretty Japanese girl named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who is not only intelligent, but can hold her own in a fight with any of the guys. The two seem to make a perfect match. Meanwhile, the Jaeger program enlists the help of two scientists to tackle the obstacles of the Kaiju's origins and why they're coming to Earth. Dr. Newton Geizler (Charlie Day) and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) make up this mad scientist duo and provide a good bit of comic relief as they try to solve the Kaiju mystery. Finally comes Ron Perlman as black market Kaiju organ dealer named Hannibal Chau, who might just be the greatest character invented for the big screen in the past few years. I seriously want a spin-off movie focused on him.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro knows how to film big action sequences in such a way that got the whole audience I was with cheering, clapping, laughing and yelling. Whether it be a Jaeger swinging an oil tanker ship like it was a sword, or one of the mega robots ripping out the tongue of a monster, everything is done on an epic scale with a heart-pumping soundtrack. The Kaiju all look very different from one another and seem to have minds of their own. The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the two main leads, Hunnam and Kikuchi, are one of the biggest downfalls of the movie. While I like these two actors, they both fall completely flat with their surrounding co-stars, and their acting is almost laughable at times. But the film moves so fast and keeps so much else going on that you tend to forget about that problem.<br/><br/>Idris Elba gets a great 'Independence Day'-style speech, and has a deep dark secret that I want to explore more. Charlie Day is terrific as the comic relief and Burn Gorman is a brilliant mix of Dr. Egon Spangler and Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>Among the big action sequences, del Toro does a great job of developing the characters, even if they're a bit clichéd and silly. For this type of film, it works. This is one of the most entertaining movies of the year and I can't wait to see it again. A sequel is already in the works, so when Idris Elba yells, ""Today, we are canceling the apocalypse!"", take that with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>Don't forget to stay through the credits for a great little scene."

","We have all seen too many awful monster movies, but Pacific Rim marries the world of the massive Kaiju and the world of the human pilots for the Jaegars (massive mechs) really well. This isn't just a monster movie. It's a movie where people from whatever background come together to fight together against aliens who are trying to take what it ours. This movie is so uplifting and positive. There is no evil exec who is trying to hurt the heroes for no reason at all. There are just brave men and women fighting against an impossible foe and winning. This movie shows the best in human nature, They fight and spoiler ......win despite some pretty bad odds, without it ever feeling cheesy or forced. Can't wait for Pacific RIm 2."

If you can sit and switch your mind to innocent fun mode you'l enjoy this film."
"bencsik-laszlo91","7","0","1","21 June 2015"," My request: more action or less talk in the sequel
","When the first trailer came out it was quite obvious what to expect. It convinced me that Pacific Rim will be an action packed blockbuster which doesn't want to take itself too seriously. It's one and only goal is to be entertaining. I was okay with that and said: bring it on!<br/><br/>Visually this movie is unexceptional, there is no question. Even Michael Bay would hide behind his render farm because Autobots and Decepticons are just the shadow of these giant Jaegers. Well choreographed fights are the top of the cake. Every move, every punch was clearly visible and this made encounters more enjoyable. My eyes could follow every epic second and i was able to tell who fought with what, unlike many fight scenes in Transformers.<br/><br/>Besides the stunning visuals the movie has some other good points. Del Toro has a great sense to create original and unique worlds by using set design and practical effects. Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth are the perfect examples for that. In this case, he had less chance to shine his talent because most of the scenes were dominated by special effects. In spite of this, he could smuggle some of his trademark into the events which made those look more existing. Many object and place were practically made and this helped to balance the high use of CGI. For instance, the Kaiju's parts in those huge containers or the internal space of a Jaeger's head (the control panel for the pilots) were actually built. Moreover, the set design looked not just outstanding but also effectively functioning.<br/><br/>The exposition part was great, enough information was given and it built up the upcoming events very well. The two pilot system was reasonable and creative, such as the idea of the ""drift"" which served as a strong bond to control machines.<br/><br/>There are two reasons why i gave this title 7 instead of 8. Firstly, the ""characters"". I wasn't expecting deep or multidimensional characters but what i received is clearly below the line. Rinko Kikuchi was so terrible she could easily win an award for the most annoying character of the year. The others were average or even worse, the only positive exception was Ron Perlman, his manifestations were the only highlights of dialogs.<br/><br/>The second problem was the relatively few action scenes compared to the length of the movie. The first 15 minutes met my expectations, it made me stunned and amazed at the same time. Unfortunately, after the first encounter nothing happened for an hour. Instead of more action we received more irrelevant dialogs and clichés backstories which was a unreasonable move. The running time could bear more action or less talk...<br/><br/>In the very end i got what i wanted but it couldn't cause that complete satisfaction i was looking for. All in all, it is what it looks like. Brainless epic fights are guaranteed, just the right amount of them are missing. However, i will definitely watch the sequel as well."
"amithavaldar","9","0","3","23 May 2015"," A masterpiece in and of itself
","What makes Pacific Rim larger than life is not it's amazing CGI, creature design or it's over the top camp humor and action sequences but the perfect and harmonious blend of all these aforementioned features along with a good script, an excellent cast, and the kind of direction that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the flick. Sure it's not a ""2001 a space odyssey"" if that's what you're expecting but it is a masterpiece in of itself.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro the director of the film has done a wonderful job of making sure that Pacific Rim doesn't become a mindless action film which bombards the audience with CGI and eye candy like the ""Transformers"" series nor does it focus too much on the drama or human aspects of the film like the movie ""Godzilla"" does. A perfect balance has been stricken and there is a little bit of something for people of all age groups and hence everyone goes home happy.<br/><br/>The movie starts by explaining about an inter-dimensional hole that has erupted in the Pacific Ocean called the ""breach"" (hence the name Pacific Rim) through which giant monsters called ""Kaiju"" come to our world and wreak havoc. Unable to defeat the Kaiju through traditional means, giant robots called jaegers are created to fight them. These jaegers have to be operated by two people as one person cannot handle the ""neural load"". The pilots need to have a good rapport or be ""drift compatible"" as the movie calls it. The pilots get access to each other's feeling, thoughts, memories etc. including their fears and anxieties; hence they have to work harmoniously lest either one of them succumb to their insecurities and get both the pilots killed. As it turns out more and more kaiju keep coming from the ""breach"" and they keep evolving and adapting and the military just can't keep up. As the plot progresses we come to understand that these kaiju attacks are not as random as they had initially thought. How our protagonist's deal with this problem permanently forms the climax of the film. <br/><br/>The actors have done a brilliant job and we can literally sense their desperation as they happen to be Humanity's last resistance against these alien monsters. As unearthly as the plot sounds the actors dedication to their respective characters gives this film its ""realistic"" tone. All in all I'd conclude by saying that Pacific Rim is a must watch and truly happens to be a cinematic masterpiece. I'm giving it 9 out of 10 for its ability to rehash age old genres like mecha and the giant monster attacks/creature feature films and present it to a new generation in a totally revitalized and an amazing way."
"CleveMan66","9","0","6","20 May 2015"," ""Pacific Rim"" is exactly what it's supposed to be - eye-popping, action-packed Sci-Fi fun!
","Some movies stand absolutely no chance of winning a Best Picture Oscar but that's okay. Movies don't have to be a showcase for brilliant actors, touch your heart or change the world in order to be worthwhile. Isn't ""to be entertained"" the simple reason that we go to the movies in the first place? Of course, I'm often entertained by movies that do one or more of the things that I just listed, but sometimes a movie is entertaining just because it's FUN. And ""Pacific Rim"" (PG-13, 2:05) is a lot of fun! In this movie, enormous, ugly, ill-tempered sea creatures (called Kaiju) periodically emerge from the Pacific Ocean, come ashore and wreak havoc on populated areas of countries that border the world's largest body of water. The only thing that humans have found to fight these extremely unpleasant monsters with any degree of success are giant robots (called Jaegers) operated by two people inside the robot's head. These two ""pilots"" make the Jaeger's arms and legs move by moving their own arms and legs, oh, and sharing their thoughts and synchronizing their actions through some sort of high tech mind meld. Sound dumb? It is. And delightfully so! As quirky characters mix with serious warriors who are all trying to stem the increasing tide of unwanted visitors emerging from the deep, they forge bonds, solve problems and get to the bottom of why all this is happening and how to stop it. The basic story, the relationships between the characters, and the way they deal with problems aren't terribly original (borrowing from any number of movies, to include ""Transformers"", ""Godzilla"", ""Starship Troopers"", ""Avatar"", ""Independence Day"", ""Armageddon"", ""Top Gun"" and even ""Inception""), but it's still very enjoyable to watch. Here's one example: When the leader of the pilots gets up on a vehicle and makes a rousing speech that ends with the line ""Today we are cancelling the apocalypse!"", you'll probably think of Bill Pullman's big moment before the climactic battle in ""Independence Day"", but it won't bother you.<br/><br/>One reason I liked this movie so much is the actors – especially Idris Elba (""Prometheus"", ""Luther"", ""The Big C"") as Stacker Pentecost (!), the man in charge of the Jaeger program (or whatever they call it – it really doesn't matter), Charlie Day (""Horrible Bosses"", ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") as an over-caffeinated scientist who just might be able to figure out the answer to how to save the world, and Ron Perlman (the ""Hellboy"" movies, ""Sons of Anarchy"") as a mysterious man who is able to help Day's character – and who wears the coolest shoes ever captured on film. Also appealing are Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi as the very different, but very well-matched heroes who pilot the oldest Jaeger in the inventory at a critical moment in the effort to rid the world of the Kaiju once and for all.<br/><br/>The main thing this movie has going for it is the visual effects. Just about every frame of this movie explodes with color – more than in any live-action movie I can remember seeing – and the 3-D makes that color seem to go on forever. The sound effects are pretty amazing too. I'd give the film Oscars in several of the technical categories. But don't worry about how many awards ""Pacific Rim"" did or didn't win – just see it, if possible, while wearing those plastic glasses with the special lenses! For not having any higher goal than giving people a good time watching a movie (and delivering) and for its stunning audio and visual effects, I give ""Pacific Rim"" an ""A""!"

","In the near future giant monsters known as kaiju start attacking cities around the Pacific Rim, they have come through an interdimensional portal called 'The Breach'. The kaiju are virtually impervious to attacks from normal weapons so giant robots known as Jaegers are constructed; each is piloted by two pilots who must link minds to control their Jaeger. At first it looks as if humanity has gained the upper hand but things get worse and soon only a few Jaegers remain. Working out of Hong Kong their leader, Stacker Pentecost, brings ex-pilot Raleigh Becket, who is haunted by the loss of his brother/co-pilot, back into the Jaegers where he is partnered with new pilot Mako Mori. As the attacks increase in frequency the remaining Jaegers will have to attempt to destroy the breach; a dangerous mission which if they fail could be the end of mankind.<br/><br/>Even though I'd heard good things about this film I wasn't expecting anything too great and as it started I soon thought all the tedious clichés would be appearing again many of them did but I also found myself enjoying the film. The cast doesn't include many well-known actors; the only two I recognised were Idris Elba and Ron Perlman and the latter only has a small role. This didn't matter though as they all did a decent job. Charlie Hunnam may be playing a cliché action hero as Raleigh but he makes the character sympathetic and Rinko Kikuchi is likable as Mako. Also notable are Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who provide some levity as scientists Dr. Newton Geiszler and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb. While the story and characters are good this film is really about the action between the kaiju and the jaegers and I must say it was pretty impressive even when watched on a small screen cities are devastated and at one point a jaegers beats a kaiju with a ship! Overall this might not be the greatest of films but if you are looking for large scale action involving giant robots you could do a lot worse and as there is little to cause offence it can be enjoyed by younger viewers too."

","Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Brian Cranston, and freakin' Guillermo del Torro. How can you possibly say no to a team like that?<br/><br/>It was probably names like these, combined with the gritty, neon- mecha aesthetic, that made you decide to watch this movie. That being said, the movies writers, producers, and even lead actors were almost completely useless. The characters are forced, the plot is stupid, and none of it will inspire a single interesting thought. If I could, I would have literally cut every scene without Godzilla, Kaiju, or Jaegers. But the fight scenes... Sweet Zombie Jesus, those beautiful fight scenes. If anything, this movie is a testament to what a visionary director can do with a ton of good CGI.<br/><br/>As del Toro admits in behind-the-scenes footage, almost all of the film's basic concepts are ripped off of mecha anime. That being said, the details of the fight scenes are breath-takingly original. Every light reflecting off Godzilla's reptilian body, every nuclear- powered Jaeger footstep, every building that explodes into millions of virtual pieces, every volcanic glow behind leathery Kaiju wings. It is all meticulously designed to maximize visual pleasure. This is eye-candy that hasn't been seen by cinema thus far."

","Those who think that Transformers movies are awful will most likely praise Pacific Rim as being better in every single way, because it is. The film is directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who is one of the most consistent directors working today, and has cast full of perfectly capable actors/actresses. It is obvious that Del Toro was making this film for fun, and not for the awards season, since Pacific Rim does not have the overall tightness and quality that some of his other films have. Some of the acting is a bit questionable, and the script is far from special, which is especially apparent when Idris Elba gets some screen time. He is meant to be an military leader type character, and is the most generic one sided version of that character. Overall, the film is okay, but an excellent addition to the monster movie genre."
"CroTony","9","0","1","5 March 2015"," Fun and spirited!
","It has been a very long time since I have seen a movie as well spirited and unburdened by current social, political or ecological world issues like Pacific Rim. Its a world in its own right. Del Toro has shown us before how capable he is at building fictional worlds in his pictures, but this one just might be his very best.<br/><br/>The colors, designs, audio and visual effects are wonderful and they combine perfectly to form something that will stay in your memory long after you leave the theater.<br/><br/>The characters are a bit different then your usual fare for summer blockbuster. They aren't sarcastic, they aren't fast talking, action savy smarties who sound like they fell out of the Joss Whedon show. They are very contained, without overblown personalities and quirks (except the scientists duo and the Ron Perlman character), who feel very humane, vulnerable and likable without forcing it down your throat.<br/><br/>The story is here only as a carrier for action and characters, its simply serviceable, not extraordinary in any way or form. You might even call it bad in its essence, but nobody expects Shawshank Redemption in this kind of a flick. Compared to other summer blockbusters it falls right into middle. Nothing good, nothing bad, just serviceable.<br/><br/>The action is where its at. The first scene gives us a lengthy ""suit up"" sequence where we are introduced to the world of Pacific Rim and its own techno visual language. It is followed by a fight scene amidst raging seas under lightning lit night sky. Its breathtaking, everything feels weighty and larger then life. Its a brilliant introduction, without too much sizzle and more then enough steak.<br/><br/>In conclusion Pacific Rim is the definition of summer blockbuster in its most purest form. Its fun, its showy, but it doesn't bombard you with pop culture references or annoying characters that are supposed to be forcefully charming. I predict a cult status for this movie in the following years."

","There's not much else that I can say other than giant robots punching kaijus (Giant monsters). I've watched kaiju films since I was a kid, and really, all pacific rim is, is a special effects leap. A very large one. Though other than that, don't expect to actually take anything away from the plot, we're just here to watch giant things punch each other. However, none of the chars were un-like able to the point where they were annoying, and even though there was close to no development, it sort of felt like there was something to lose if some of the pilots died. My final point is the soundtrack, which just makes everything feel more massive, from the guitar to the sirens of the jaeger. Over all, not much plot or characters, but this movie, was probably one of the coolest things I've seen."

","In writing the review for this film, I'm doing the film little justice. This film has to be seen first by the person who reads this review and then he can judge for himself.<br/><br/>First of all we take a look at the director Guillermo del Toro who has made such successful films like Hellboy (2004), its sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), Mimic(1997), The Devil's Backbone (2001) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006), and more mainstream American action movies, such as the vampire superhero action film Blade II (2002). You can expect only the best in the special effects and sound-effects department. <br/><br/>The cast is also equally good. All the actors act naturally and set the mood for the film. The script is very effective - there is never a dull moment in the film. I particularly liked the role of Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost. Other notable actors are Ron Perlman of Hellboy fame and Santiago Segura who played the fiendish vampire named Rush in Blade 2, Charlie Day and Burn Gorman. The hero and heroine of the film are played by Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket and Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori.<br/><br/>Plot of film: a rift opens in the floor of the Pacific ocean in 2013, revealing a portal that connects between the earth and another dimension far across the universe. Through this rift Kaijus, colossal alien beasts which attack the human cities, come. To combat them the Pacific Rim nations build the Jaegers, equally colossal robotic war machines. Each Jaeger is piloted by two people whose brains are linked (called ""drifting"") to share the mental load of operating the machine. The Jaegers are initially effective, but many are destroyed as the Kaijus grow more powerful and their attacks more frequent. Finally humanity on the brink of extinction must make a final attempt to stop the aliens for good.<br/><br/>Verdict: by all means buy this film if you can afford it and watch it at home on your LED TV. This film is value for money if seen at your local cineplex. <br/><br/>Films you might also enjoy: Nemesis(1992), Robot Jox (1989), Aliens(1986), Tremors(1990), Independence Day (1996)."

The fight scenes are comprehensible - more rare these days with frantic camera-work - the CGI sure ain't cut-rate (the budget's right there on the screen) and the sound design adds just the right punch to the whole thing. The cast is just unconventional enough to pull off the cocky flyboy band of heroes (anchored by a commanding Idris Elba, not to mention the lovely Rinko Kikuchi).

","When giant monsters or 'kaiju' began emerging from a dimensional rift deep below the Pacific Ocean, the nations of the world pooled their resources to create giant bipedal robots called Jaegers as humanity's first line of defense. But when mounting losses prompt world leaders to look to other, perhaps less effective methods against the intensifying attacks, the remaining members of the Jaeger program gather everything they have left for one desperate strike to close the rift and save Earth.<br/><br/>Alright, so you know walking into Pacific Rim that you're not going to get stunning plot twists, unconventional storytelling, contemplations on deep themes, or insight into serious real world issues. You're here to watch giant monsters and giant robots throw down. And do they ever. The battles are fast paced, physical, expertly staged, and beautifully filmed. The quality of the fight choreography is the highest I've seen in any giant monster movie. The designs of the mechs and monsters are excellent, and they're gorgeously brought to life with a mix of CGI motion capture, detailed models, and occasionally by what appeared to be good old fashioned rubber suits. It's like Ultraman or Power Rangers, only a hundred times better. The upcoming Godzilla reboot is going to have to work hard to equal this.<br/><br/>Beyond the action and the effects, what sets this apart from your average kaiju flick or a certain other franchise built around giant robots is the wit, humor, and even intelligence it displays. Neither the acting nor the writing is likely to win any Oscars, but unlike far too many entries in the genre, they're actually pretty good. Character's actions actually have motivations. Instead of wooden acting and stilted lines delivered without feelings we get people who show emotion and talk the way you would expect real people to talk. Compared to the choppy dubbing jobs kaiju fans are used to, this is a godsend.<br/><br/>The most original part of Pacific Rim is a rather interesting process called drifting. Each Jaeger carries two pilots, who share a direct neural link not only with their machine but also with each other. When this link is established their thoughts and memories become shared, as they 'drift' through their own and each other's pasts. Besides being kind of trippy, this provides the excuse for powerful flashbacks that let us and their co-pilots see who they are and what they've been through more effectively than any amount of conversation or narration. This is especially true in the case of Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) a young Japanese pilot who lost her family in one of the first kaiju attacks.<br/><br/>Importantly, this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It goes into enough scientific explanation to be plausible, but not so much that you're eyes will glaze over. It features destruction on a massive scale and characters that have experienced deep personal loss, but it never becomes grim or overwrought. And it leaves room for some very good comic relief, most of it centered on a pair of eccentric researchers who share a pronounced Odd Couple dynamic.<br/><br/>By all reasoning a movie that can be summarized as giant monsters vs. giant robots should have been just another soulless explosion filled special effects fest. And it probably would have been if not for director/co writer Guillermo Del Toro, who would never let one of his projects stoop to such a level. Instead he's paired the action and explosions with solid directing and storytelling. As awesome and adrenaline pumping as the battles are, it's the human element that makes Pacific Rim one of the most fun movies of the summer."

","Pacific Rim has been on my eye from the moment the trailer first came out, although the effects really didn't disappoint the overall storyline could use more original ideas. After seeing so many positive reviews of Pacific Rim form around the web and close friends it was clear I would have to see it, having known that Del Toro has directed Pacific Rim my expectations were already much higher due to his previous amazing movies(e.g. Pan's Labyrinth, the Devils Backbone, Hellboy). The general concept isn't in anyway bad that has to be stated straight off, but the same repetitive ideas that can be seen in Pacific Rim have previously appeared in the movie industry over and over again. I would still highly recommend this movie. It is a great movie to own and a brilliant movie to watch and add to your collection although perhaps it's not something I would watch consistently once in a while its a great movie to re-watch. Just a shame such a great director didn't see the repetitive features in this movie compared to others, yet still. Its a must see. Great effects, and with a far eye the storyline isn't too bad either with quite a few twists."

This movie has non-stop action happening throughout the whole movie, and even if that's not what your into, the amazing use of special effects can not be doubted. The movie is about an alien race called the kaiju, who come up from the Pacific Ocean and cause a war with the human race. In an attempt to stop the creatures, the human race build their own type of monsters called jaegers, and start to push the kaiju back. It is a must see movie, that's all there is to it. there is a good cast of characters and an amazing script, but the thing that I love probably most about it is the theme tune.

Of course, a movie like Pacific Rim will not have deep plot twists and a great story, it is just made to entertain people and show off the great film making skills nowadays.<br/><br/>The small monsters that came out of Kaijus were just so awesome looking, so props for that. The ending battle, where they finally got into the portal and destroyed it was just awesome, although wanted to see some interaction between people and those ''aliens''? who made Kaijus, but maybe that is left for a sequel?

"LTSmash14","10","0","1","5 November 2014"," Dear: Hollywood, Please Don't make Pacific Rim 2
","Pacific Rim is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest pieces of cinema in recent years. I haven't yet gotten bored of it, and it's ratio of ""times watched"" to ""times it made me cry"" is on par with the ratio of me and Terminator 2 (1:1 all the time every time). So, why wouldn't I want more, you ask? Here's why.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim stands for everything Hollywood used to be. In the recent years, movie trends have included things like world issues, sequel setups, and the dreaded remakes. Pacific Rim was amazing for not being ""any of those things"" but for simply being a beautiful robots vs. aliens smash hit.<br/><br/>It doesn't care about world issues.<br/><br/>Every movie has to care about world issues. Casino Royale and the following Daniel Craig bond movies all had something to do with ""the world is running out of oil,"" even when that didn't lend to the plot at all. Even my beloved superhero movies have all made allusions to topical world political issues. There is something to be missed about not necessitating, say, a plot point where the Transformers technology is being weaponized for overseas wars. In Pacific Rim, the world all comes together to fight a common enemy. THAT is the world issue. <br/><br/>Tangent: That's part of why we all love zombie movies so much. It's humanity vs. evil. Period.<br/><br/>It doesn't take itself too seriously. <br/><br/>If you didn't like the ""Cancelling the apocalypse"" monologue from Stacker Pentecoast, then I don't even want to know you. Pacific Rim doesn't shy away from villainous ploys (the way Chuck says ""Raleigh"" is masterpiece cinema), monologues, and characters speaking to each other while facing opposite directions. It's a beautiful nod to the movies of old that has an almost self-aware campness. Pacific Rim knows it's robots vs. aliens and doesn't try to give a more serious spin on it, like say, ahem, TDK series.<br/><br/>It has a beginning, a middle, and an end.<br/><br/>Open: exposition. Alien monsters are coming from beneath the Ocean Floor. We found a way to handle them. Body: It's not working anymore. We have to find another way. We have one more shot at this with our giant robots. End: ***Spoiler*** WE DID IT!<br/><br/>Perfection. Pure perfection with nothing else needed. The movie didn't go all ""The Hunger Games"" and split stories up to make us see 4 movies. It started, and finished. Beautifully. <br/><br/>It isn't a remake or a sequel.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is an original story. It's not the only robots vs. aliens story, but it also isn't a remake or a sequel. Since the start of downloading movies, the only things that have been super reliable at the box office are remakes and sequels playing on my generation's love for nostalgia, prompting us to still flock to the theatres. Original stories don't make it the way they used to, so Hollywood sucks stories dry until there is nothing left. <br/><br/>But Pacific Rim, which admittedly didn't have the box office reception in the West one would have hoped, created a new story starting and finishing it in one beautiful film. <br/><br/>To make a sequel to Pacific Rim is to take what I felt was a statement against the new Hollywood, and completely ignore that to stretch out a sequel. Pacific Rim is the robots vs. aliens story of my little movie geek heart's dreams. Finally, a throwback to the fun of the past when Godzilla was a new concept, and King Kong was a classic. To when remakes of The Shining and Carrie weren't necessary. To a time when if you wanted to see the Ninja Turtles in live action, you had to dust of a VHS or order Pizza Pizza. To a wonderful world where Transformers was a cartoon and didn't need A-list stars and young models in booty shorts to be marketable. To standalone sci fi like Blade Runner and Donnie Darko. To a time when ""Her,"" ""Rush"" and ""The Help"" would have done better at the box office that TDKR, Divergent, and Anchorman: 2. <br/><br/>So that's why, Hollywood, I am asking, nay begging you, please don't make a Pacific Rim 2."
"g-bodyl","8","0","2","20 October 2014"," The Smart Man's Version of Transformers!
","Now I'm not going to bash on the Transformers franchise because I like the movies and they are my guilty pleasures, but they are just dumb action spectacles. While that is meant in a good way, I think Pacific Rim is a smart action spectacle. While there is nonstop action and heavy special effects present at all times, this film has more of a complicated story and a more proved(and well-liked)director than Transformers. The concept of giant robots fighting these gigantic monsters really intrigued me. It's not all perfect since some fights drag on, especially in the last half, but it's an entertaining, well-written summer spectacle.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro's film is about how humankind tries to stave off extinction from these colossal monsters named Kaijus who appeared from a portal in the Pacific Ocean. The humans create these Jaegars or mecha robots to fight these robots. When things hit rock-bottom, the world must rely on a washed-up former pilot named Raleigh to save the day.<br/><br/>This film doesn't have a big-name cast, but they get the job done. Relative newcomer Charlie Hunnam does a really good job as Raleigh the guy who has an emotional past as a pilot. Idris Elba was fantastic as Raleigh's superior, Stacker Pentecost. I was really surprised at Rinko Kikuchi's performance because I only know her from Babel and this is a complete turnaround. But she does an excellent job as the girl who uses her fury at these monsters to destroy them. Finally, Ron Perlman does a great job in his few scenes. That man can be pretty funny at times.<br/><br/>Overall, Pacific Rim is a gorgeous movie to look at and the visuals are spectacular. Unlike the Transformers films, this film has a purposeful story and it's more layered than one would expect. On the outside, it looks like another movie about robots, but on the inside it's about comradeship, family, and believing in another. This is a rather unique taste on telling the story about the apocalypse. While the action is excellent, some of the scenes could be more toned. Also, this film closely resembles 1998's Godzilla monster-wise, although it's much better than that train wreck. I had a good time thanks to Guillermo Del Toro. I rate this film 8/10."

"tomimt","7","0","2","27 September 2014"," Silly yet entertaining
","Pacific Rim is kind of a silly movie. It's heavily influenced by Japanise monster anime, where huge robots beat the sense out of equally huge monsters. That is not a genre I am a huge fan of, as the ones I've seen tend to be a bit overly melodramatic and in that Pacific Rim also does dwell its own share. When all is said and done though, Pacific Rim does manage to be an entertaining, albeit very predictable movie about how underdogs finally manage to beat the odds and save the humanity.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie isn't anything spectacular, it's merely an excuse to show as many robot/monster battles possible. The characters are equally uninteresting archetypes with nothing interesting to offer and the only thing the movie works is, that the battles do look pretty damn good. Guillermo Del Toro directs with a steady hand and has made the action sequences both entertaining and easy to the eye.<br/><br/>Del Toro's direction saves quite a bit in the movie. If he'd be a poorer director, the movie would be borderline unwatchable, but he manages to keep the strings nicely in his hands. PR isn't a masterpiece of cinema by any means, but it works reasonably well for what it is: a movie about huge robots pummeling monsters."

","There's a big tradition of stories about robots saving earth. Not until ""Transformers"" was it possible for modern cinema to adapt it for the big audience. As child I always dreamt of a real movie with anime style robots, now it has come true. This isn't an Arthaus-Movie and it never tries to be one. It's full of cool animation, stunning visuals and action. Yes the plot is simple, but hey, I've watched almost every single Sci-Fi flick out there - believe me, I saw much worse when it comes to narrations and plots! The acting is adequate, at times a bit overacted, but it won't really make you sick either. Like most of the late movies, this one is also aimed at world audition, so expect it not wholly concentrated on western culture, although Asians and Hong Kong serve just as some sort of ""extras"". I loved these battle machines so much more than the ""Transformers"" because of their style, but yes, without the latter, there would never be a ""Pacific Rim"" at all. All of the other guys going to watch it were very much pleased as well, but admittedly: this nothing for the girls. It's a love or hate movie and I love it. In the Sci-Fi genre it's worth an 8/10"
"Notorius2","8","0","1","14 September 2014"," Godgila, transformers and King Kong ain't got **** on Guillermo
","I am rating this movie with an 8,mostly because it stands as a directing lesson to Michael Bay.And to anyone who wants to walk the path to this strange genre.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro is an extremely talented director, bringing us interesting mind-grabbing stories. And he couldn't do better in this movie. The story and the way it is presented to us are really good. It is full of twists, and solid explanations for all the crazy scientific staff going on. The only thing lacking is the acting, with the main protagonist playing exactly like he is Jax Teller from Sons of anarchy, an Asian girl who waits until the last minute to saw some emotion and the Newton scientist guy, a character who has no chemistry at all with any other actor in this flick, and just ends up being annoying and necessary. <br/><br/>In fact even a child can see that the only good acting comes from the transformed Burn Gorman, the actor who also portrays the iconic Game of thrones dark assassin character.<br/><br/>The most commendable feature in this movie is the fights. Where the 2014 Godgilla fails to saw the gigantic monsters for more than 5 minutes and the transformers franchise have the audience wandering Who's fighting what or What's fighting who, Guillermo Del Toro gives us full lengthened, well orchestrated, gigantic robot fights. And makes him self an example for future gigantic monster movies."

","Okay, being a fully grown man, perhaps I should have grown out of enjoying watching big, over the top monsters smashing big, over the top robots to bits by now. Sadly, I haven't (which also probably explains why I'm single).<br/><br/>If you're looking at Pacific Rim (a film where big, over the top monsters come out from a portal at the bottom of the ocean and start laying waste to our cities, therefore meaning Earth creates an army of big, over the top robots to stop them) on an action-only basis, then it's a sure fire winner. Yes, I loved the action - it was truly amazing special effects wise and I was instantly a twelve-year-old boy again.<br/><br/>Sadly, I'm also a thirty-six year old adult, which means that my logical brain does demand some sort of cohesive plot to tie a two-hour film together. This is where Pacific Rim fell down. It seemed to take every action cliché from the last two decades and put them in here. A fair part of the story is told in a 'Lord of the Rings-style' monologue at the very beginning of the film, eliminating the need for any complex plots - it just tells us what's been going down. Then we have the need to recruit the burned-out ex robot pilot who's quit the service, but is the only hope we have now (a cliché so old it was lampooned in Hot Shots Part Deux), plus, when our hero does step up to the challenge, he's met with suspicion and downright hostility from the other pilots (think Team America of all films!). Then throw in the obligatory 'love interest' and dialogue that seems as if it's been completely lifted from Independence Day and you have a weird mish-mash of action films.<br/><br/>However, all this may be cliché, but you still have the epic battles to fall back on. I forgave all this and just let my inner child enjoy itself. The only real downside were the (yes, clichéd) scientists. Seriously... they're 'uber-geeky' to such an extreme they wouldn't look out of place in a cartoon. In my opinion, if you're looking for a silly, over the top, all action film then you'll enjoy what's on offer here (I just fast-forwarded the scientists in the end - they could well be related to Jar Jar Binks - they're that bad!).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","This is a really good, original and cool action movie. The fights between the giant monsters and robots are awesome and the clear highlights of this movie. There is not really anything more I can really say about that. The other parts between the awesome fight scenes are not on the same level but are not bad. The plot is simple, gigantic monsters comes from an other dimension and ruins everything for us nice human beings and all of humanity comes together to stop the giant monsters from horribly murder us all by making giant robots. The story is a bit of a mess because there isn't much that makes sense and they do not really take time to explain anything and it reaches a level of so much doesn't make sense that it bothers me. Things like two people are needed to control the robots are good plot points but doesn't make any sense at all.<br/><br/>One thing I loved about the movie is that it is international. The characters are from all over the world and small things like the giant robots are called Jägers and the monsters Kajju makes me smile a bit. Loads of smaller details like that and more makes the movie unique. Details in the movie like how the world adapts to the threat of giant monsters, the Aussies dog mascot and the black market for giant monster body parts just says to me that they put a lot of thought into it when they made the movie.<br/><br/>The Characters are good. Not incredible, not great, but above what you usually see in action movies. All main characters are in some way flawed and has problems they have to overcome. The only characters that bothered me was the scientists who were really annoying and could have been done better.<br/><br/>Even if the movie has several flaws, it is an original and a great action movie.

"TheFilmGuy1","8","0","2","28 July 2014"," Fun Is The Best Word To Describe This Movie
","There seems to be a recent revival of the ""kaiju or monster genre"" of film, and I am pretty happy about that. That's not to say that I'm a fan of the old style kaiju movies, but I think it's a genre that is perfect for this day and age of CGI. There is so much you can do, and this movie is an example of that. <br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro was certainly the right man for the job to do this film. His creativity really shines through, especially with the monsters, and it's great to see, especially if you saw it on the big screen. It's also a wonderfully colourful film, which is really visually appealing. The place where Del Toro goes wrong, however, is with the screenplay. I know there is two actual screenplay credits, but it feels like it was written heavily by Del Toro. When it comes to writing American characters or just English speaking characters in general, Del Toro isn't that great. In fact, it can be downright cheesy. But just like the recent television show The Strain, which Del Toro also wrote, the cheesy-ness kinda makes it fun. Most of the characters are stereotypes, but they are fun ones that can be easily enjoyed. Also similar to the writing of The Strain, the stand out thing with this movie is just the who general idea of the Kaiju and their attack on earth. It just feels like a really cool and creative general idea, and that keeps you on board even when the individual characters dialogue falls flat. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, this movie is total fun. It's not some deep art house film, it's just a visually appealing and well made action film that entertains. It's certainly a movie that needs to be seen by people who like films like Godzilla and other monster movies. (Ironically enough, if you have seen the recent 2014 Godzilla remake, the two monsters that Godzilla fights are incredibly similar to two Kaiju that show up in this movie. In both films, one monster has wings and flys, and the other moves like a Gorilla. Just thought i'd mention that fun fact.)"
"DonaldDooD","7","0","1","22 July 2014"," One of The First Good Giant Monster Movies of 21st Century Film
","I think some people took Pacific Rim too seriously. Yeah, there was a lot of hype surrounding it, but you can't really expect an epic, revolutionary storyline from a high budget Power Rangers movie. And as such, it does a good job, where Godzilla 1998 and the Transformers franchise failed. The Host and Cloverfield came closer, but weren't grandiose enough. King Kong did a great job, but that was almost a decade ago. Pacific Rim puts its enormous budget to good use, with some great special effects and vicious fights.<br/><br/>The characters are pretty flat, though. Most can be described in one word, and some barely have lines. Charlie Day is liked by some, by I found him to be annoying, leeching time from the screen with his subplot. The two leads were likable, and Idris Elba is as boss as ever. But there should be more, considering the length of time you spend with them.<br/><br/>Its made up by the action, IMHO. Titanic robots vs gigantic monsters has never been done better. The CGI is very good, the robots have cool designs, and each individual monster has a unique body type. Both sides are evenly matched, and you do get a sense of increasing danger as the Kaiju become larger, more intelligent, and specialized. There's hardly an easy battle, as Jaegers get smashed, Kaiju sliced and incinerated. The sheer scale is rarely matched in blockbusters, and the camera is calm enough to let it sink in.<br/><br/>Oh yeah - the main theme is one of the most heroic themes of all time, despite the Inception horn.<br/><br/>Its not exactly intelligent, but as a fan of mecha and monsters, Pacific Rim does so well what so few are doing that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. If you like the idea and hold your expectations right, its a perfectly good popcorn film. Its shallow, but its not like they could do much more with the concept.

There was a relatively good amount of background from the well designed, vague and pretty ******* awesome Seamonsters, not much, but enough. I also found that, the idea with the bonding of minds and brains and memories, was extremely well made. They didn't just show it as it being a piece of cake to do, but that you had to be able to fight to get through the process.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were good, but far to confusing with all the perspectives and angles of the filming. Plus, the robots or machines could in my opinion just be a transformed Semi-Truck, if you know what i mean. They weren't extravagant or had any special equipment. e.g. the constant sword and blades that they pulled from their arms, were pretty similar to those that Optimus Prime had in the first ""Transformers""!<br/><br/>To sum it up, good movie with lots of potential to make it better."

The acting and/or story department usually takes the hit.<br/><br/>Bearing that in mind, Pacific Rim is a great movie.<br/><br/>It's described as a 'creature feature.'<br/><br/>If you didn't feel a breeze of hesitation flit by, you're probably going to enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>Just pop it in and know your qualms will be minimal if you're not seeking weaknesses. Enjoy the spectacular CGI and seamless visual effects, a handful of solid performances from a cast of mostly unknowns, numerous elaborate fight scenes and a way better story than you'd normally expect out of the prototypical summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>Read on carefully, though, I may spoil something below.<br/><br/>The first actor I recognize on-screen is Charlie Day, and that is about thirty minutes into the movie. I kind of liked the cast of mostly unknowns.<br/><br/>I thought Mr. Day turned in a compelling performance and enjoy the contribution of his subplot. I had no idea the mind-melding scene was coming, and it expands the dimensions of the overall story in a pleasing manner.<br/><br/>On a related note, Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori, and Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket (the protagonist) enter one of her memories and deliver a chilling but sweet scene.<br/><br/>The film toggles between the two main forms of human defense: biological study and military tactics. One provides much needed backstory, the other stays on the forefront of battle. And it works well!<br/><br/>The only other big names are Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost and Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau (who is just a great character.) Seems like old Ron and Guillermo are buddies after the Hellboy franchise.<br/><br/>It's as if Guillermo Del Toro (or Willie of the Bull, as I like to call him) said, ""Given the context, I want well-choreographed clearly-illustrated fight scenes, and the sharpest narrative possible."" And the crew delivered.<br/><br/>Although there is two or three cringeworthy scenes, these are easily admissible if you're the forgiving type. When the protagonists quarrel with their rivals, Chuck and Herc Hansen, a little shoving match breaks out and is only momentarily painful because of some poor acting.<br/><br/>Other than that, there is little worth criticizing here.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is more than an impressive effort. It relays a much better story than is necessary with swells of grand fight scenes and an epic ending.<br/><br/>It's a lot of fun."

","Godzilla meets Transformers in this fun, action extravaganza. If you're looking for your giant robot fill this summer, this will do the trick. Is there cheesy dialogue? Over the top bravura? Paper thin characters? Absolutely! But you expect this going in and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Unlike Olympus Has Fallen, it knows it's a big, dumb action movie and doesn't pretend otherwise (which I found kind of refreshing). You don't really care that much about the characters and the story is straight forward, but there are *fantastic* special effects and some really epic, entertaining action scenes.

"The-Plague","6","0","3","9 June 2014"," As aliens start to emerge from the ocean and attack cities giant robots are created to fight back, but will they be enough?
","The movie starts out with the main character, played by Charlie Hunnam, talking about the arrival of aliens who seem nearly indestructible, and the creation of a new weapon to fight, which was basically just a giant rock em sock em robot. About 7 minutes later, what seemed a lot longer, we finally get out of voice over mode. I would have been mad, but in the film's defense, it jumps right into an action packed fight scene. The special effects were quite good, and the monsters, or Kaiju were pretty damn well put together. I would say that they were definitely intimidating enough to scare a little kid, much like the movie 'Gigli.' The movie was over two hours long, but it was paced very well. You get a lot of plot and good acting between fight scenes. Charlie Day was hilarious as always, it seems no matter what role he plays you end up just wanting to hang out and have a few beers at the bar with him. Charlie Hunnam was on point, nothing special, but he was supported by Rinko Kikuchi playing the female lead, who is not only hubba hubba attractive, but can also act. Clifton Collins Jr. and Idris Elba also had notable performances. There was an unexpected cameo from Ron Perlman, (no he wasn't in his Hellboy costume) who was an interesting character himself.<br/><br/>When you think giant robots fighting aliens you find yourself wondering if you are going to remember old childhood cartoons and feel somewhat nostalgic, but 'Pacific Rim' does a good job of keeping the concept fresh and keeping you in the now. I didn't make one Voltron comment! The fight scenes are well shot and not a giant blur like in some action movies. Guillermo del Toro did notable work directing, but I couldn't help but feel like something was missing from this movie, that little something special he put into his other projects. Even without that something, 'Pacific Rim' is definitely worth the watch."

","As action/sci-fi movies go, this may be the ultimate combination of everything you could possibly want. There are robots, dinosaurs, crazy technology, dystopian pre-apocalyptic conditions, epic fight scenes, and special effects to rival those of avatar.<br/><br/>While all these elements may not make this movie original or groundbreaking in anyway, they are undoubtedly things that just make it AWESOME to watch. However what made this movie completely painful to watch were the characters, and gaping plot holes. <br/><br/>In most movies, you usually feel SOMETHING, ANYTHING, for the people portrayed, however in this film I felt more love and compassion towards a bulldog that gets 60 seconds of screen time than any of the actual characters. This is partially due to a god awful script, and partially due to some god awful acting. I found myself actually groaning out loud at some parts due to how painfully obvious and ridiculous the scenes were. <br/><br/>This movie actually starts out really strong in the plot department, and gets you really interested and excited for the story to progress, however it all just goes downhill from there. Like why did the governments continue to back the wall even after it failed so obviously? And why did they figure out how to close the portal literally just DAYS before the apocalypse, when it had been open for like 10 years already? Couldn't that have been done sooner? Or why did the pilots remember they had a FREAKING SWORD only after destroying half of Hong Kong and flying out of earth's atmosphere? <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is so stereotypical it hurts a little bit, but it is clear that the characters and plot were seen as just backups to the main star, which is the undeniably cool robot dinosaur boss battles. This is simply the action movie of all action movies, which makes it both kind of terrible but kind of amazing a the same time."

","Guillermo del Toro directed this big-budget CGI Sci-Fi tale that starts off explaining how the world became under attack by giant monsters called Kaiju, who invade the Earth from a breach from beneath the sea, in a plan to invade the Earth and destroy the humans, who retaliate by building equally gigantic robots called Jaegers piloted by two people linked as one mind to carry the psychic load. Nearly defeated by years of escalating assaults, the humans launch one last, desperate assault on the breach itself, to end this war once and for all.<br/><br/>Entertaining film with lots of action and impressive F/X, and clever touches and nods to other films, is still pretty far-fetched stuff, but handled with reasonable intelligence and care.

I suppose it made for a good buddy movie like watching Maverick and Iceman competing in 'Top Gun'. You know how it will eventually turn out between them. I'm sure giant monster fans, of the Godzilla variety would like it, that was never my favorite type of film. I found myself getting a bit bored with the silly giant sword bits and all. I imagined Japanese viewers might love that part. Sort of a giant robot samurai or whatever, to me it was childish like a Saturday morning cartoon for kids.

When someone tells you that and you're honest with yourself, you've got to see it, right.<br/><br/>When I'd watched it, I thought it was a fun movie. I didn't get bored. It had a classic story with lots of the classic ingredients: traumatized main character, wicked scientists, etc. I really enjoyed it but it didn't really touch me and it didn't really 'stick' with me afterwards. But that's kind of what I was expecting. I don't see any deep and meaningful themes in it and I won't say it's artistic just because it's Guillermo del Toro's. I don't really think he had that intention anyway. I think he just wanted to make something cool this time. No more, no less. If his fans want to turn this movie into something like a far-fetched political statement disguised as an action movie, that's fine. But I won't. (Remember: he made Hellboy to.o) This was no more than a fun movie, temporary enjoyment. I would probably watch it again on TV but I wouldn't stay home for it, record it or buy it on blue-ray or something. I wouldn't call it awful and I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. I just thought it was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Never mind that lots of things in the movie were not really credible. And I don't mean 'realistic' by that. I'm a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan.

"MasterFantastic","8","0","1","30 April 2014"," Robots versus Monsters. What else could you want?
","You can't accuse Guillermo del Toro of being subtle in this picture. Pacific Rim is basically a slugfest between giant robots called Jaegers and giant monsters called Kaiju after the Japanese word for, what else, monster. It takes monsters to destroy monsters, and after an invasion by aliens from another dimension through a rift in the ocean floor, the governments of Earth unite and build giant robots to smash the living daylights out of those monsters who want to colonize the planet.<br/><br/>Synopsis out of the way, the pluses in this movie are many. Eye-popping special effects, monsters that actually look like they weigh what they're supposed to weigh--some CGI effects take that mass effect away--a solid supporting cast led by Idris Elba, and del Toro's trademark offbeat humor displayed so aptly by Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau, Burn Gorman as Doctor Gottlieb, Charlie Day as Doctor Geizler (both he and Gorman play the typical eccentric scientists that S/F movies always have to have) and a very nice semi-romantic ending between the two leads (Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam) along with a rousing musical score by Ramin Djawadi.<br/><br/>Kikuchi plays her part nicely and doesn't stoop to stereotype, while the love/hero interest is portrayed by Charlie Hunnam...<br/><br/>...and that leads to the one drawback of the movie. His performance is only a shade above wooden. Granted, he looks good and shares a couple of nicely underplayed scenes with Rinko Kikuchi--their relationship is marked by loss at first rather than actual physical attraction--but overall, a store mannequin would have given an equally moving performance and Hunnam is largely forgettable. His narration at the beginning of the movie is also somewhat offputting, but overall the movie is so much fun and Perlman in particular steals every scene that he's in, that it's hard not to like this film.<br/><br/>Will there be a sequel? Hopefully yes, as long as Perlman (and his trademark gold shoes) is in it."

Great and colourful effects in contrast to darkness and gloomy settings are creating a gripping atmosphere. The special effects are really authentic and impressive, and the animations are thoroughly realistic. Therefore the budget of 190mio $ was well-used.

"japamo","8","0","3","3 April 2014"," Take Note, Toho, Dean Devlin, and Roland Emmerlich - THIS Is How It's Done!
","Even to this day, Toho's demented giant creature features and Devlin/Emmerlich's 1998 ""Godzilla"" remake have their defenders (and I am among them to a limited degree). Yet, every so often, even champions of these ""kaiju"" (Japanese for ""monster"") flicks, and I, must have wished that these flicks could get a sophisticated big-budget CGI blockbuster treatment and still remain faithful to their roots. To a triumphant degree, ""Pacific Rim"" (hereafter PR) has answered our prayers.<br/><br/>As it should be, the premise is simple and direct. As PR's prologue explains, for millennia, seemingly countless sky-towering kaiju kept emerging from a fissure or portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and ravaged the earth for food and resources. Fortunately, mankind discovered that heavy nuclear weaponry could repel and destroy these bizarre beasts - at first. However, more adaptable and invulnerable Kaiju emerged from the ocean floor. As a desperate last defense, mankind (through the Pan Pacific Defense Corps or PPDC) constructed skyscraper-sized robots called Jaegers (German for ""Hunters"") to combat the Kaiju.<br/><br/>These robots are not sentient. Indeed, because of their colossal size, Jaegers require two pilots, each representing the left and right hemispheres of the brain, to operate the left and right sides of the robot body - like a combination of virtual reality and remote control. To make sure the Jaeger functions fluidly (and not like a schizophrenic drunk), the two pilots must establish a neural link (called the drift) that permits telepathic communication and sharing of ideas and memories. The only drawback to the drift is that the pilots may share traumatic memories that inhibit their performance and jeopardize the mission.<br/><br/>Among the best of the Jaegar pilots is gung-ho, cocky, but appealing Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff). However, an abortive Kaiju mission costs Yancy his life. His confidence understandably shaken, Raleigh becomes an engineer working to build towering walls in a vain attempt to keep the Kaiju out. After the barriers prove ineffective, PPDC commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba, a dependable actor redeeming himself after his underwritten role in ""Prometheus"") recruits Raleigh to give the Jaegers (namely Gypsy Danger) another go. Besides his loss of nerve, another obstacle to Raleigh's getting back in the saddle is finding a ""neurally compatible"" pilot. Athletic, nimble, and martial-arts savvy Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) seems to be the ideal candidate.<br/><br/>Things get off to a catastrophic start. Mako's painful memory of a catastrophic Kaiju city attack that killed her family while she was a very young girl causes the Jaeger to go haywire. As a result, Pentecost benches Raleigh and Mako and sends the remaining Jaeger team out. But when the team proves helpless against a Kaiju Hong Kong invasion, Stacker grudgingly deploys Raleigh and Mako, who get their act together and in a titanic battle stop both Kaiju.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the loudly arrogant and bespectacled Dr. Newton (Newt) Geiszler (Charlie Day) examines cerebral tissue obtained from Kaiju corpses, including the one left in Hong Kong plus its fetus (!), and from a shady, potentially lethal ""Kaiju body parts"" black marketer Hannibal Chau. Dr. Geiszler finds he can create his own neural link with the beasts and gradually learn more about them. Of course this two-way reciprocal link means the Kaiju can read and pinpoint Dr. Geiszler's mind, which imperiled the Hong Kong bunker where Geiszler hid with some of the population. With the help of the peevishly skeptical Dr. Herman Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) this all leads to a possible solution to the Kaiju problem: if the Jaegers can infiltrate the Kaiju portal and destroy it from within, no more monsters can pour out. Can the Jaegers -named Gypsy Danger- do it, and can its pilots Raleigh and Mako get out alive?<br/><br/>I found PR to be a satisfying but not mind-numbing adrenaline rush, with well-paced but exhilarating human,robot and monster action. And yet PR took the time to develop character motivations and interactions, even if you've seen them a million times before, and to make them affecting and achingly real. Mako's memory of her encounter with a Kaiju was especially shocking, sad, and eerily reminiscent of 9/11. Raleigh was appropriately committed, supportive, and loyal, especially to his partner but (refreshingly) not lover Mako, and strangely both loyal to and defiant of Stacker. Stacker demonstrated both leadership toughness and (almost overprotective) paternal care towards an unexpected adoptive daughter, and can certainly deliver an inspirational fight speech. And oh, yes, the scientists did manage to be funny despite occasional abrasiveness. I look forward to buying the DVD.<br/><br/>P.S.: I am dismayed to learn that PR is turning out to be a flop in the States. Initially, I was baffled by this, then I pondered a few possible reasons why: 1) Although there are protagonists in the movie, primarily Raleigh and Mako, I guess they weren't featured often or prominently enough for some people; 2) Almost all of the monster/robot fight scenes were filmed at night, perhaps to conceal some perceived CGI flaws; 3) Admittedly it was sometimes difficult to differentiate the fighting combatants because of some quick, close-up editing, 4) I believe some people have a xenophobic and foreign bias against seemingly ""non-American"" movies, and 5) ""Kaiju"" movies may have mainly an esoteric or devoted cult status. Oh well, that is their concern. As retribution, I hope PR cleans up overseas, and particularly breaks box-office records in Japan.<br/><br/>P.P.S.: I've heard that a 2014 Godzilla remake is in the works. For it to succeed, I highly recommend it have the lines ""He's unstoppable."" and/or ""All our weapons are useless against him."""

For the most part, it was deserved, though I would have liked it to spend a little bit more time explaining why they could build such a high-tech machine yet couldn't make it work with one operator. I mean, even present-day tech can make pilotless machines, let alone machines operable by one man.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the story moves fast - a short background of the man-monster war, a quick overview of the Jaegar and its capabilities, then lots of action scenes. In terms of action, this movie does not disappoint. There are lots of action sequences, lots of machine-monster battles, and just a bit of psycho-talk to let the heart-rate rest for a while between battles. I didn't particularly care for the slow scenes in-between where the characters examine one another's motives - they didn't add much to the movie, but they didn't distract much from the main plot either.<br/><br/>The Kaijus were for the main part credible. I do have some quibble about their origins though. While I can accept them evolving into intelligent creatures, I thought some of their capabilities were too far-out. I mean, an organic being which can generate their own EMP pulse?<br/><br/>The acting was passable - for the most part, you could feel the characters' excitement and anxiety. Character development is scant, as expected from an action flick, but I went in expecting lots of epic battles, not character profiles anyway, so it wasn't a loss for me. Many would think me petty for saying this, but Hunnam's voice and tone here grated on me for some reason. And it's not his fault, but he has way too many clichéd phrases.<br/><br/>The CG effects were commendable, since it is not easy making battles involving huge robots and monsters seem realistic enough for you to suspend disbelief. I am a little disappointed though that most of the major battle scenes are night or underwater scenes - so some of the action is lost in the darkness - lots of bright lights and explosions, but details are lost.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an epic action movie, this one should feel the need just fine."

Thus, former pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) team up to defeat the apocalypse.<br/><br/>Hunnam and Robert Kazinsky, who plays Chuck Hansen, were the two actors who basically saved the film. They had substance in their acting performances and gave the film some heroism and sensitivity, counterbalancing the overly corny and trying-to-be-funny acts by Burn Gorman and Charlie Day. Idris Elba's performance as Stacker Pentecost was as stiff as a sore neck and Mori's character looked like a deer-in-the-headlights in numerous scenes. Her role did not suit her well. Ron Perlman's awkward Hannibal Chau character was pathetically thrown in for marquee value, serving no purpose in the movie.<br/><br/>Aside from the mostly lame acting, this movie did have some very sophisticated special effects and the monster battles were well executed - very fun to watch.

Oh, and we're going to do it with what are essentially robots that are about the same size and don't get all seized up when you drop 'em in water. Plus, when they walk in the water, there never seems to be a sudden drop-off that means the bottom drops out from under them. You just have to accept all that.

","""Haven't you heard Mr. Beckett? The world is coming to an end. So where would you rather die? Here? or in a Jaeger!"" <br/><br/>This was an entertaining relaxing mind-to-zero movie. Best you lie back in your cozy seat to enjoy this one after a stressful week. That means you have to close one eye for the meaningless story and the abominable acting. The whole movie has the ""We will prevail"" attitude. For a moment I had a real ""Top Gun"" deja-vu moment when the doomed couple triumphantly returns after a dramatic fight with two Kaiju's. There's even a nod of approval from an arch rival. The latter hates the male half of the victorious couple and rather sees him evaporate from this world. Maverick and Iceman probably nodded approvingly at this crucial moment.<br/><br/>The superfluous speech by Stacker reminded me of Bush on the rubble of the Twin Towers and sounded so ridiculous patriotic. The whole movie was indeed a tribute to ""The Transformers"" that had a fun time fighting Godzilla-like aliens. The movements of the Jaegers were in fact already amply addressed in ""Real Steel"" in the recent past. The predictability was obvious. Especially when my wife already said in the beginning: ""Oh, no, I bet that one of the twins won't make it?"" And five minutes later it seemed she was right. It was no surprise that the spectacular ending would follow the mandatory Holywoodian directives : a dying ex-Jaeger sacrifices himself so that the hero and heroine can manage to get their robot through the connection at the last minute and then as a cherry on the cake, the supposedly dead hero pops out of the water.<br/><br/>Why was this movie so good you wonder? The bloody slick and beautiful made action scenes. This was pure enjoyment every time. Both in and under water, it looked phenomenal. Most overwhelming were the parts where the battle took place on the mainland. Trucks, containers and supertankers were tossed around like Matchbox cars, compressed as tender buns and used as a destructive weapon against the dinosaur monsters. The CGI looked stunning except that it was sometimes hard to distinguish what happened in close-up moments. Without the special effects, a movie like Pacific Rim would be difficult to achieve. This was the ultimate prove you can create images with computer images in a convincing and realistic way. It all intrigued me so very much and never lost my attention for a moment.<br/><br/>What really surprised me was the fact that there is a evident romantic tension between Raleigh and Mako, but they didn't fall for the old cliché to let those two lovebirds fall into each others arms. That would have ensured a gagging shiver-moment for me. I also liked the two totally crazy scientists. They were so terribly annoying and played in such an excessive way. But that made me like them even better at the last moment. Especially when they are standing next to each other after the final triumphant victory, with their nervous puffs and a moronic smile.<br/><br/>The humor wasn't present very strongly, but when Hannibal Chau holds his boastful speech about the fact that he knew that the baby Kaiju wouldn't live much longer, because the lungs weren't developed completely, and he still ended up being swallowed by it : now that was funny ! A CGI spectacle around a kind of empty story ...<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

","I'm going to be honest with you; I wasn't excited about this movie. I thought the trailers looked stupid, so I was surprised with all the good reviews. Even still, I wasn't sure if I would like it, because I thought it would be an ""all flash, no substance"" kind of movie. So I watched it and enjoyed it much more than I expected. The story actually works really well. I thought it would be one of those movies that was missing story, but it worked. It simple and sweet. This movie also has lots of really cheesy, really dorky moments. I like these because it really showcases what a monster movie is supposed to be. It's not all just intensity, there's also some dorkiness there. And it's displayed perfectly by a schizophrenic, easily excited, glasses wearing nerd, and his grumpy, British, cane wielding partner. They made the movie for me. The acting was all around pretty good, but those two are the story sellers. The action is really cool and flashy. It's not necessarily adrenaline pumping, considering all the robots and aliens are big and kind of slow, but they are exciting. Everything just looks awesome. The robots and aliens just look and sound cool. Oh, and I like the gore. It's not bloody or anything, but there are some alien body parts ripping off and out, showing blue goo. It's awesome! Overall, this movie is a lot of fun, from the action to the dorky scientists. I realize this movie is not going to be for everybody, but if you like action movies, monster movies, or intentionally cheesy dialogue, then watch it. You'll enjoy yourself. It definitely isn't the movie of the summer (in my opinion it's ""The Man of Steel""), but it is very enjoyable."
"taz1004","5","0","6","26 February 2014"," Why didn't they...
","I actually wasn't expecting much out of this movie. And I was right to do so.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of similarities with Evangelion. Yes, Evangelion, Gundam, and Transformers are all about giant robots but very different concepts. This movie however is very similar to Evangelion in concept. They may say it's inspired by Evangelion but I think it's borderline plagiarism. The Jaegers and even the Kaiju were very simiar in design. The suit, the escape pod, method of transportation, neural syncing, docking... list goes on and on.<br/><br/>Story however fell far below Evangelion. Tries to mix corny love story. Main character's acting was below average. Special effect was average.<br/><br/>They should've just paid the royalty and make live version of Evangelion instead of this cheap knockoff."
"Prismark10","6","0","1","13 February 2014"," Monsters get ready
","Guillermo Del Toro goes 'Mecha-Anime' harking back to the Japanese Kaiju films. It's Godzilla monsters causing mayhem in an updated way.<br/><br/>Less cheesy than the Transformers films, in fact maybe a little bit too po-faced here and there. Del Toro delivers enough action, mayhem and destruction in Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>The plot is generic. The film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is at war with the Kaijus, colossal monsters from a dimensional portal on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>To combat the monsters, humanity created the Jaegers; gigantic humanoid mecha's each controlled by at least two pilots who have initial success but the monster keep on returning stronger than ever.<br/><br/>Piloting the Jaegers we have standard characters such as a cocky operator, a plucky rookie and a burnt out maverick with bad memories of the past. They put the their differences behind them and learn to work together as the threat the planet face intensifies. Idris Elba is the one who is in charge of them all.<br/><br/>There is comic relief from two bickering scientists and more zaniness when Ron Perlman turns up as a gangster.<br/><br/>Del Toro provides some added cheese to go with the action and a little depth as well. A few plot holes but the film is still enjoyable fun."
"Rincewind799","7","0","1","1 February 2014"," Very entertaining, if your prepared for it!
","I had to wait a certain amount of time, till I was ready to give this movie a try. <br/><br/>When I first heard about Del Toro doing a NGE styled movie I was hooked. After the movie hit the theaters, opinions where mixed. A lot of people (me included) expected more from him, maybe something deeper and more refined.<br/><br/>Had I watched the movie right after the release, I had given it a score of 4-5. But as time went by, I still liked the concept and a lot of friends said the usual stuff like ""you have to turn off your brain and enjoy the ride"" and I responded with ""Oh, is it that bad?"". I watched to many bad movies to waste my time with another one. But then a friend got hold of the Blue-ray and I watched it. I knew what I could and could not expect and the most important part, I accepted this for myself.<br/><br/>I have to admit I enjoyed watching this movie! Nothing brilliant, no surprises, but in the end more then I hoped for and over two hours of visual stunning action. This movie certainly isn't boring! Why did it work for me this time around? Because the movie never tried to be more than it was. It doesn't take itself seriously and feels more like a comic with its share of humorous moments.<br/><br/>The more important part for me was the revelation, that you can't rate a movie once and for all. Your life changes, your behavior changes and also your thinking. How many things do you like, just because you where there when they got created? How many of those things would you experience in a completely different way, if you would encounter them now, for the first time?"

","watching a bunch of giant robots fighting monsters is awesome. There is no denying that. Pacific Rim embodies this notion. Pacific Rim is The robot vs monster movie. That being said, everything else about it is pretty damn terrible. The actors are all trying way too hard and it seems that everyone involved was having a hard time taking the subject matter seriously. Maybe because everything in this movie has been done before. The whole plot is ripped from every aliens attack movie. ""Aliens attack and humans put aside their petty differences to work together to destroy the attackers"". Its so cliché its ridiculous. I was constantly having flash backs to other movies. Most notably would be of course Godzilla, Transformers and also Independence day. Even the ending reeked of Indep Day. The black market for kaiju parts was somewhat interesting but it was all way too Hollywood. The scientist's were also vaguely interesting but watching them interact and grow as characters made me want to puke. Jackson Teller just looks like he hopped out of Sons of Anarchy and into a robot suit. Again, robots fighting monsters will always be cool and the special effects are top notch but everything else is unintentionally cheesy and cliché, its very much similar to the Transformers series."
"rahmannoodles22","7","0","3","19 December 2013"," Pacific Rim - Noodles Review
","The story is actually really simple, in which huge monsters rise up from an inter-dimensional portal in the Pacific Ocean. The movie drops you in the middle of it, in which it's been happening for awhile so we've created huge badass robots to fight the monsters. It's a decent enough premise to make the awesome concepts of battles between giant monsters & giant robots plausible. It's reason enough for us to get locked into this movie. The character development was alright, as was the acting. Charlie Hunnam plays the protagonist; and while I absolutely love him in Sons of Anarchy, he's not spectacular in the movie. He gets the job done and you root for him but you're gonna buy his action figure. Then there's Idris Elba. We already know he's awesome, because with every role he takes on, the film could be terrible but you know Elba is gonna perform greatly. However, not everyone comes to this movie for the characters. We came to watch giant robots battle giant monsters. And I'll tell you it's so awesome. The battles are so epic. The scale of these battles are humongous and it allows you to actually see the entire fight occur, as opposed to the Transformers movies where it's all in you face and you can't tell what's going most of the time other than the sound of clanking metal. No, with this movie you see it all, and it is absolutely awesome."
"leonblackwood","6","0","3","17 November 2013"," Epic CGI, poor storyline! 6/10
","Review: What an epic 2 hours! In some ways, this movie just seemed like Transformers mixed with Starship Troopers, but the director did try to give it some depth with the whole 2 people controlling the robot thing. I did enjoy the film, but Idris Elba wasn't the best choice as the head of the team. I think that he should have played one of the guys in the robots and that Ron Perlman should have played Sergeant because of his mixture of wit and seriousness. Anyway, the CGI was great and the fight scenes looked amazing and very believable. You really do have to watch the film in HD, Blu-Ray or the cinema to get the best out of the film because there is a lot of attention to detail on the robots. As for the storyline, I was a bit disappointed with the whole save the world theme because it got corny towards the big showdowns to the end. You can't fault it for the action which was why I personally enjoyed the film. Epic!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Idris Elba seems to be all over the place at the moment. I'm surprised that he's actually got time to do Luther, which seems to be loved by everyone around the world at the moment. Anyway, the main character, Charlie Hunnam, who was the skinny guy in Green Street and the main character in Deadfall, seems to lack emotion in the film and I had difficulty relating to his character. His acting style reminds me a lot like Sam Worthington, who I also find difficult to watch. With the amount of work that went into this project, they really did need someone with screen charisma, like Hugh Jackman who played the same type of role in Real Steel, and done a good job of it. Anyway, for the amount of money that they must of spent on graphics, they had to get who they could afford, which was why there wasn't any really massive names in the movie and they concentrated on the look more than the feel, which was what needed the most work.<br/><br/>Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $408million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there human vs. robots type of movies with loads of action. 6/10"
"ciffou","Null","0","3","17 November 2013"," This could have been done in the 80s
","Maybe after watching The Bourne trilogy I expected Guillermo del Toro would be able to deliver action with intelligence or depth (The kind of depth that you find in a blockbuster like ""The hunger Games"" if you realize what it is the actual story is criticizing). I guess the fans made me think ""Maybe this is an unappreciated gem"". But hell no. This is as generic as an action movie can be. It could have been easily made in the 80s. The Russians can get you any weapon, there are quirky characters and attempts of ""comedic relief"". <br/><br/>Things remain the same: we have one damaged, mourning hero that is going to succeed in his work while facing the backlash of the new, fresher guy that is paired with his father (That is only 14 year his senior). I guess Del Toro thought it could be progressive to have a black man in charge and a woman fighting but nothe girl fights but she is always rescued ever since she was a girl and then our hero has to ask the other guy to ""apologize"" to herthey also later are going to do something ""to clear the path for the lady"". So, no. There are no new things in this movie. The camera movements are so done, the victory speeches are cheesy, falling down while being chased downGod!

Although I think he has went down in my estimations getting on board with this tripe! <br/><br/>What was up with the acting? Honestly, it felt like Del Toro asked everyone when he was filming to pretend they were doing an episode on Nickelodeon! I mean the 2 scientists, they could have been played by Kenan & Kel and it wouldn't have been more over the top! <br/><br/>I guess it is a saving grace though that this film was made, as it meant a certain director didn't get to see through one of my all time favourite fantasy stories.

"hughesreviews-co-uk","7","0","3","27 October 2013"," 'Pacific Rim' is awesome in both the literal meaning of the word and it's more adolescent expression, but it lacks the characters and plot required to elevate the spectacle.
","In between all his Spanish art-house films, Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro loves to do a good sized blockbuster. 'Pacific Rim', Del Toro's follow up to 2008′s hugely enjoyable comic book adventure 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army', is as sized as it gets.<br/><br/>Whether he is tearing up cities in 3D, or directing independent projects in foreign languages, Del Toro always does his work with a strong dose of passion, love and integrity that makes him a true auteur. Unbelievably, in all this monster mayhem, you can see that this is the same man who directed the small fantasy/war/drama masterpiece 'Pans Labyrinth'. Every film he develops appears to be a passion project for this genius, and he does not discriminate when it comes to budget; injecting beautiful fantasy design, considerate storytelling and overall good taste. This is the difference between something like 'Pacific Rim' and 'Transformers'. Love of an unappreciated genre pours of the screen, as does the visionary's artistry and lack of cynicism. Del Toro ensures he evacuates his cities before the mass destruction ensues (unlike a certain Superman film) and he does his best to ensure there is no glamorization of the military, or the violence. This is a strongly anti-fascist human being, and I have no doubt he is someone who is sensitive to the political implications of his images. Despite his best attempts, he can't escape an inevitable ooh-rah, gung-ho mentality, but because it is such an unpretentious experience, that embraces it's B movie charm, you don't tend to think too politically about a film in which a guy orders ""Elbow rocket!"" and then proceeds to wallop a glowing gorilla monster in the face. Really hard.<br/><br/>But there is more to Guillermo than rocket punching. If anything, the film is a call to unity. ""The bigger the bond, the stronger you fight"" sums up a film about international community and humanities need to work together. Jaegers need two pilots to operate them; we literally cannot fight the threat without co-existence. The two pilots need to mentally transfuse with each other, share minds and control the robot in a process called the drift. The heroes are not heroes unless they are together. I find this message to be more ideologically agreeable, and easier to embrace, than the jingoistic, pro-military; sexist inclinations of a certain Michael Bay. It's true that I have a bit of a man crush on Guillermo Del Toro – being such the great human being he is – but 'Pacific Rim' is an original concept in a time full of sequels, prequels and reboots. Most of all, it captures the awe of what action spectacle can and should be.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is majestic. Kaiju, inspired by a vast array of animals, are biologically fascinating and rather beautiful. The Jaegers, inspired by everything from buildings to John Wayne, are impressive in it's mechanical detail. These robot Jaegers have personalities and reflect their nation of origin; they are characters in themselves. The CGI which brings Del Toro's vision to life is wonderful. A scene in which a half broken, defeated Jaeger collapses unto it's knees before two bystanders, on a winter beach, feels more like the stuff of fine art. It is an image that has every right to be painted, framed and placed in a gallery. As with any Del Toro movie, there is a staggering attention to detail that you will most likely notice more on a second viewing. Not just visually; there are all to brief moments when we witness – 'Starship Trooper' style – life of humanity at war. Jaeger pilots become media heroes to the population; in the style of WW1 fighter pilots like the Red Baron, and there are propaganda war posters covering the planet. Not to forget the Kaiju poop. Also, the crew of a Jaeger feel more like a WW2 bomber team; showing the many historical influences the filmmakers drew from. This subtle world building enriches the overall experience and may come in quite useful for any sequels/prequels.<br/><br/>The 12 year old boy inside me was loving it. The apex of boyish joy is the beautifully luminescent battle of Hong Kong. The scale is huge; and regular appearances from helicopters circling the monster vs. metal clash emphasizes this fact and the ridiculous size of the movie in general. You literally cannot get away from the low angle shot; Del Toro is continuously reminding us that these things are gargantuan. Unfortunately, the movie can never quite top that enthralling sequence and the resulting third act is a bit of an unimaginative disappointment that is far too similar to fellow alien invasion spectacle 'Independence Day'.<br/><br/>Performances are fine, but almost all the characters lacked any real personality. This is by far the biggest drawback, and unfortunately, from a narrative and thematic point, it is a problem as big as a giant Kaiju. Idris Elba, however, is great; as he cancels apocalypses and walks around with the awesome name of Stacker Pentecost. Not only is he a charismatic bad-ass, but his character is the most interesting by a long stretch.<br/><br/>This is a love letter to the Japanese Mecha and Kaiju genre and the works of fantasy visual effects artist Ray Harryhausen. Beyond that, it is a statement to western audiences that the 'Godzilla' remake was not the best introduction to giant monsters. 'Pacific Rim' is a beautiful cross cultural blend and the affection the film evidently has for it's influences is infectious. I want to delve into my collection and re-watch 'Godzilla', or 'It Came From Beneath the Sea' and then explore the many films and anime I have not seen yet. After the disappointing collapse of Del Toro adapting either The Hobbit or At The Mountains of Madness, it is good to see a project with his name finally on it.<br/><br/>Go to hughesreviews.co.uk for the full article, more film reviews and more features!"

","If you don't like big dumb action movies, CGi driven films, Manga, Sci- fi, etc, then you will not like this film. The script is fairly predictable, with the acting somewhat flat and derivative.<br/><br/>But if you do like any of the aforementioned genres, what we have here is a film that is literally big on action, scale, effects and sci fi, and genuinely unique. It is not a sequel; does not get bogged down by officially borrowing source material from any previous book, series or lore (other than it's similarities with Manga Neon Genesis Envangelion). In a golden year of original sci-fi movies, this one stands out as being a true piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>The battles are impressive, with skyscraper tall robots fighting monsters. The key thing with these fights is that the sense of scale is brilliantly conveyed to the audience. Powerful yet lumbering, something that the increasingly poor Transformers films failed to provide in their fast blur robot battles.<br/><br/>SO the script is predictable, but who cares?

","As we know, Guillermo del Toro is fond of fantasy and visual effects, and state-of-the-art technology enables him to provide more flashing scenes and fights - regretfully at the expense of pithiness and novelty. Similar monsters, equipment, fights, reasonings, types of characters (politically correct approach of different races and ages) etc. have been visible in dozens of movies - so is the ending, typical to Hollywood blockbusters. Bearing in mind the development of technology in recent decades, it is still odd why there are still so many Godzilla and transformer figures in movies! And you can easily guess which characters survive and who lose their lives...

","Monsters known as Kaiju come from a deep rift in the Pacific Ocean and wreck havoc over the entire planet. World governments get together to build giant robots called Jaegers to combat the Kaiju. Inside the robots are 2-people who act as left-sided brain and right-sided brain because one person alone is not capable of handling the Jaeger. The ultimate goal is to close the rift and be rid of the Kaiju. <br/><br/>There is no other way to say it: this is a CGI-fest. There are some acting scenes and they are pretty good by all. What was most annoying were the 2-scientists whose constant bickering almost made me align myself on the side of the Kaiju. Hey, I said ""almost."" <br/><br/>The 2-scientists Charlie Day as Dr. Geiszler and Burn Gorman as Dr Gottlieb could possibly start their own stand-up comedy team except for one thing: they weren't funny and were highly annoying. They could have been handled in a better way, but weren't and this goes to prove that comedy is hard to do. And, to make matters even worse they talked so fast no one could possibly understand what they said. <br/><br/>The hero is Charlie Hunnam (never heard of him before) as Becket and his love interest is Rinko Kikuchi (never heard of her before either) as Mako. They form the team to go into the ultimate Jaeger to defeat the Kaiju and to try to drop a nuclear bomb into the rift and close the bridge to upper earth. Idris Elba is Stacker Pentecost but is referred to as Marshall, at times, in the movie and he does a credible job as the person in charge of everything. Ron Pearlman as Hannibal Chau was in here and it is not clear what his purpose was. Maybe most of his scenes were cut and we were left with wondering why he was cast.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is CGI with battle scenes after battle scenes and they are very good, but when it goes on for too long, too often, I tend to go into La La land when that happens. This movie is also in 3-D but the DVD I had wasn't. Bummer.<br/><br/>If you are a CGI Nerd, this is for you. If the battle scenes were shortened , a better rating would have been given. They just go on for toooooo long. Hey, I'm yawning here. Can't you tell? <br/><br/>But, here's the thing: Let's say the bomb works (and, I'm not telling) and the bridge is closed, the Kaiju would still be down there waiting for another opportunity to come up again. The movie did indicate that the Kaiju were not acting on instinct, but were commanded by higher-ups in their species. Would you like to live on a planet where this scenario exists? Huh? I know some will say it's only a movie. Right? (5/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

With that said.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't get a chance to see the film in theaters because there was a major family crisis. However I got to see the BluRay/DVD which I just picked up today. I was really entertained. It really was cool to see a giant monster movie again, it's cool to see a modern take on influences of Ray Harryhausen and Ishiro Honda and Mech Anime Some of the greatest influences of our time. Nothing like Duking it out Metal Vs. Monster. I also liked that it was a bit over the top and a movie like this should be. Not to mention it is kind of needed.<br/><br/>I will not talk about the story, all I will say is. Make the decision for yourself, I recommend watching it even if for just a cheap 2 hour thrill. Make your own opinion about it.<br/><br/>Was the story award winning worthy, hell no. It isn't supposed to be. Was the acting above and beyond no, because it isn't supposed to be. Albeit the visual effects were stunning and beautifully created, I think overall it is something a nerd like me can fully enjoy.<br/><br/>I am not too crazy about overuse of CGI and any other forms of animation, but in a movie like this, there just isn't getting around that, especially when it is at this scale. For me this movie was a dream come true.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a good monster movie(not counting Cloverfield)since King Kong, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla. Those types of films paved the way for these types of movies and then you have the Anime element. The giant human operated mechanized robots or battle/mobile suits if you will. You enter that with a death match between battle suit vs. monster makes for a good action monster movie the whole family can enjoy.<br/><br/>Another aspect is the profanity. There wasn't over use of profanity. And that gets my approval. I don't need gratuitous amounts of profanity and sex in movies for me to enjoy them. Profanity serves no purpose in the real world or movies, other than to sound like an unintelligent and uneducated moron. Sorry to those of you who sear up a storm, that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>Back on topic, it is a good film and I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it. It is a film the whole family can enjoy. What ever you do, do not take someones word for it. Go in with an open mind and make an opinion of your own. Oh and don't forget to pop a bag of popcorn and have a nice cold soda at your side. If you have read all of this. I thank you for taking the time to do so and I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did."
"nesfilmreviews","7","0","2","15 October 2013"," ""Pacific Rim"" will fully satisfy the summer blockbuster demographic.
","The mega summer blockbuster ""Pacific Rim"" delivers plenty of eye-popping action and battle sequences galore, but there is not enough beneath the pyrotechnics to leave a lasting impression. The very notion of giant robots trading blows with monsters across the world is likely to induce as many groans as it is cheers. Those cynical of the premise, though, may find themselves somewhat interested that director Guillermo del Toro is bringing his signature flourish to ""Pacific Rim,"" an ode to Japanese monster cinema. Kaiju originates as a Japanese word roughly translating as ""strange monster,"" but more pertinently here, Kaiju is the name for this entire genre of sci-fi, where massive creatures step on buildings and threaten to destroy civilization.<br/><br/>The future of the world is threatened by an alien force, which unexpectedly, comes not from outer space, but from the center of the earth. In an attempt to stave off the seemingly inevitable domination of these creatures and the destruction of mankind as we know it, an army of giant robots manned by elite commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), and his crack team including renegade officer Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), and rookie soldier Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), head to the edge of the Pacific Ocean for the mother of all showdowns.<br/><br/>""Pacific Rim"" will fully satisfy the summer blockbuster demographic and sell lots of popcorn, but the repetitive visual fireworks eventually runs thin over the course of 131 minutes. The films set pieces, in particular the destruction of Tokyo, and the climatic battle at the earth's core between the man-made monsters and their non- human adversaries, are undeniably impressive. The action is gigantic, with elaborate CG-animation staging showdowns in pouring rain or at the bottom of the ocean, delivering on sophisticated movement that's utterly convincing. However, it stumbles in its attempts to inject spirit into the proceedings, and interactions and dialogue between the central cast of humans provides nothing to the experience. That being said, if you're a fan of big, loud popcorn movies, ""Pacific Rim"" is unquestionably a cut above the gnarled heaps of metal that was ""Transformers"" (2007)."

","Nostalgic. This film really brings back memories of those old Japanese monster films (Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, Gorosaurus, Anguirus, Kumonga, Manda, Baragon, and Varan) and not to mention those Japanese robot anime's like Gigantor or Voltes V. Even the background music was similar and probably re-scored from those films. The monsters maybe and are actually digitized but I can't help thinking that these are actually played by human actors in monsters suit like they used to do back then. Really neat!

In this film you will get to see all clichés ever used in either a straight up action movie or in a ""end of the world""-movie. The script of Pacific Rim could just as well have been a parody of the above mentioned films. On the other hand, the production and acting is good.

","Robots versus monsters is a very Japanese thing, but that didn't stop an Italian director from making an English language version of one. The result is unfortunately closer in spirit to those old Godzilla movies than to the anime take on the genre. That is, there is little psychology or philosophy, even though the concept of two people working as one would seem to suit such things, and it takes itself quite seriously, with only a tiny bit of humor from some minor characters.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie worth watching is the action, with some really cool monsters having big, fairly entertaining battles with giant robots. Unfortunately, the movie drags whenever it gets back to the human beings who control those robots. The square-jawed hero, the eager newbie, the cocky jerk, the tough commander, all feel like characters you create when you're too lazy to think. Two weird scientists bring a little humor to their scenes, but only Ron Perlman manages to really stand out in a small but entertaining role.<br/><br/>Perhaps Del Toro should stick to Hellboy movies and leave the robot/monster fights to the Japanese"

","You got me! I am guilty! I was born 11 years after Godzilla, and among the first things I remember was Ultraman, Ultraseven and other ultras, and Mothra, and King Ghidorah and if you don't know what I am talking about, it is going to be easy for you to enjoy Guillermo Del Toro's mix of transformers-voltron meet the ""kaiju"", and let's leave to the side the political issue about the ""kaiju"" being the bad children of nuclear energy, (ask the Japanese). <br/><br/>Pacific Rim DID NOT work for me, because one of the main reasons in the making of a movie must be ""caring for the characters"" and the only one I was worried about was Ron Perlman and his ""goddamn shoe"". The only thing that Charlie Hunnam is capable in this movie is to leave the bike and leather at home for a shiny armor, because the attitude and acting is the same he portrays in ""Sons of Anarchy"", ""Lucky"" for him he will be ""Christian Grey"", in a movie that I won't watch unless I am paid 40.00 dollars for two hours of my life. In the other hand it's a shame that the talent of Idris Elba is wasted doing an impression of Bill Pullman's speech from Independence Day. Every other character is like the rest of the extras, even though an attempt of character development is made, it fails badly, because is already too late on the movie! As born Mexican, I am proud of Guillermo Del Toro accomplishments, and I cheer for him, but for this movie he has become ""Mr. Hollywood"", a suggestion to Memo, why don't you try ""El Santo"" (Samson for the ones who doesn't know better), maybe you (Del Toro) , will get your feet back on the ground. Pacific Rim looks and feels like G.I. Joe, overcrowded with special effects, and lack of a real human element. Still, after watching the abomination of ""The Lone Ranger"", I have no more choice but recommending Pacific Rim, because is entertaining, and the ""pretty colors"" and explosions will get you an OK time for your money. I just hope that Gareth Edwards (Monsters) provide us (as he did) with likable characters for Godzilla (2014) and hopefully one day I will get to see Gaiking (201) and have the fun I did not have watching Pacific Rim."

","Pacific rim has everything a blockbuster needs: Great graphics, great action, an interesting storyline, simple characters, cheesy lines, and a decent bit of humor.<br/><br/>The graphics are top of the line. And unlike some movies *cough* Transformers 2 *cough*, the action scenes are actually immersing and thrilling, rather than confusing. They are also regularly interspersed with some storyline, so they don't get too drawn out.<br/><br/>The story is your basic alien invasion science fiction with some small differences. I'm not going to give away anything more, though to be honest there isn't all that much I could tell you that you would really regret hearing. The movie isn't about story, even if it's interesting enough that it could have been.<br/><br/>There will be some plot devices that you will see coming from miles away. But the movie also occasionally and refreshingly differentiates from the norm. For example: not everyone you expect will get eaten by the monsters.<br/><br/>As for the acting, this seems to be criticized mostly. And although the characters are shallow, I can't say that the acting was so bad that I actually noticed. In fact I kinda thought the little Asian girl did an exceptional job, and I rarely notice good acting. I also rarely notice bad acting, so maybe I'm not the best compass in this area.<br/><br/>Humor is also important for a blockbuster. Since the story is about an apocalyptic event, the amount of humor is sparse, but it's placed in the right moments where you can use a bit of laugh. Without it the whole thing would just be a bit too depressing.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim not a masterpiece by any means, which seems to be why some critics give it terrible ratings. But like all movies, you should watch it in the spirit it was intended, in this case: a mindless thrill. This is where it succeeds well, and even above expectations. I'd put it on par with the classic 'Independence Day'. With a bit of luck this movie will reach that same status."

","This is a movie of extremes. When it is good it is great, and when it is bad it is abysmal, yet the balance is still positive.<br/><br/>So, what were the hits and misses? Let's start with the bad:<br/><br/>1) Actors: Granted, the dialogs are as camp as they come and this is not exactly a psychological thriller, yet none of them went above the ""completely forgettable"" level. Except for Rob Perlman, of course and even him seemed to struggle.<br/><br/>2) Plot: this is CGI porn, and as in porn, the plot is merely an excuse to tie up some great CGI scenes. I love mindless action movies, and I usually do not have much trouble suspending my disbelief, but this time I found myself making too many efforts to dismiss some blatant plot holes. <br/><br/>3) Pacing: for a movie with no plot, even as great looking as this one, 131 minutes is just too much. With characters lacking any depth, and speeches a la Independence Day, one ends up feeling that it would have been a great 90-100 minutes movie. Not looking forward to the extended cut.<br/><br/>Now, the good:<br/><br/>1) CGI: CGI is nowadays ubiquitous so when I read some review saying ""amazing digital effects!"" I take that with a pinch of salt. To be honest, not even the new Star Wars trilogy impressed me much. But this one is great. Not a matter of budget, but of taste.<br/><br/>2) Great References: Godzilla? Mazinger Z? Anime? Sci Fi B movies of the 50s? Everything is there, but it's done with class, not a mere copy paste of random bits, but organically fused in a single piece. Many of the objections are more limitations of those genres than issues with this movie only. A wonderful homage to our childhood.<br/><br/>3) Love: Guillermo del Toro loved what he was doing and it shows. It is not the perfect film, but is still enjoyable, despite it's bad spots. <br/><br/>Hey, it's about having some mindless fun and that he achieves!"
"bkbirge","6","0","5","2 October 2013"," Godzilla updated
","This movie had lots of promise and has some fantastic well done elements. The look of the movie is great as has been noted by just about everyone. However at the same time it feels derivative. Like a great master craftsman making the same artifact over and over, each one better than the last but ultimately all being the same thing. We've seen this movie before, just not as polished. <br/><br/>Idris Elba and Ron Perlman steal the show, their characters define the extremes of the human world better than any of the others and they chew scenery with the best of them. Elba especially managed to perfectly embody the anime archetype of the pained father figure general without making it ridiculous, I don't really know how he managed to do it even though I watched it happen. Perlman was just fun in every scene but his scenes worked best when his insecurity was on display rather than the Hellboy persona he channeled for other parts. <br/><br/>The two scientist dweeb types while fun and entertaining still feel shoehorned in for stereotype. The main leads are frankly forgettable cookie cutter jock types that seem better suited to TV sitcoms or police procedural. The ""wacky"" secondary characters such as the other crew or mission ops guy we never really see enough of to care about.<br/><br/>Plot? Well, not much of that going on here. Pretty standard alien invasion/giant monster fare with the we've-seen-it-a-million-times lone wolf character coming back for redemption. This is basically a good Godzilla movie wrapped in a live action Anime design.<br/><br/>Still, as popcorn munching fun it was pretty good. If it were any other director/writer I'd give it a higher rating purely for glitzy cartoon style entertainment but I expected a little something deeper and cerebral, if only in passing, since Guillermo Del Toro was the creative driver. The theme of merging neural pathways of 2 or more people to drive a giant robot has rich possibilities but the movie never mines this idea beyond the surface. <br/><br/>If they managed to make a sequel I'd go watch it but I'd temper my expectations. <br/><br/>One good thing after watching this movie, I'm not as bummed as I was before that Del Toro doesn't get to make Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness. <br/><br/>In the credits James Cameron is thanked (among others) and I think that can clue you into what this movie is, grand spectacle extremely well crafted but very linear predictable story. <br/><br/>The movie is dedicated to Ray Harryhausen and Ishirō Honda which is another clue what this film is, a love letter to giant monster movies, and frankly that works for me. <br/><br/>Recommended with some flaws."

It is reminiscent of the much older ""Independence Day"" in the same shallow feel which isn't a compliment. Toro Super-sizes the effects and action, while the script is superficial and forced much of the time. Still the huge bravado is captivating and colorful in several scenes, entertaining enough to help you forget the boring interludes. There's too much filler scenes though that are not really well acted or scripted, and the asia-phile-ness is on full display too in excess. In short it's overlong by 15 min, and could've been leaner.

","""We always thought alien life would come from the stars, but it came from deep beneath the sea"". In fact, director Guillermo del Toro brought new life to the monster movie genre with the epic and undeniably entertaining Pacific Rim right here on land.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim delivers just about what one might expect from seeing its trailers or even just hearing about it. Guillermo del Toro's vision is complex in its ambition and scale, but simple enough in its high-concept premise. When the Pacific Ocean receives an unwelcome portal between dimensions, alien life invites itself into our world and certainly doesn't wish to remain unnoticed as mass destruction of Earth's infrastructure ensues. In response, the Jaeger Project is born, creating monsters of our own to combat the deadly, in a sense, subterranean species. Del Toro immediately invites us into his multidimensional universe, with the cinema screen acting as the portal where for 131 minutes you are transported on a journey of majestic imagery.<br/><br/>The initial 30 minutes in this new universe, (a universe which is only further enhanced by the third dimension and IMAX experience) is unfortunately spent telling us what we probably already know. There are certain films where you wish you had known less going in as surprises are spoiled by your anticipation and natural assumptions. Pacific Rim differs in no way and in fact could have benefited from more constructive and ambiguous pre-released material as its opening half- hour is more or less an extended version of the trailers. As with most stories however, judgment should really be reserved until its middle and end have executed their purpose.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is effortlessly enjoyable, tie-in toyable, with monsters and robots readily deployable into battle sequences so convincing and grand, that you look up to the screen as you would these monsters in real life and this makes Del Toro rightly employable.<br/><br/>While the action has you synchronised unbreakably with Del Toro's vision due to the prowess of the CGI, which just feels like I alone, you cannot help but wish for the camera to take a giant step backwards. Although obviously done intentionally, Del Toro leaves the camera awkwardly in between the action at times, and the result is perplexing. With films such as Jaws (1975) and Cloverfield (2008), the devastating creatures are purposefully obscure visually and shown infrequently to heighten the sense of danger and fear of the unknown. Meanwhile, with Jurassic Park (1993) and other similar creature features, we are monstrously engaged and aesthetically informed by being able to see the action and nonhuman characters clearly afar when necessary. Pacific Rim is uncomfortably framed in between this spectrum at times and this unfortunately lessens the visual value and experience of the film overall.<br/><br/>While the battle sequences are the most anticipated, decorated and appropriately stated highlights of Pacific Rim, they are only setpieces to the much bigger war. The primary point of interest away and even importantly within the action is the film's central theme of unification. Seeing the abandonment of international conflicts, petty feuds and meaningless separation between Earth's people holds a great deal of truth to it when faced with a common enemy. Del Toro maintains this theme consistently throughout the feature, with the giant Jaeger robots even requiring a coalition between two pilots emotionally and cerebrally to function capably.<br/><br/>While puny individual Earthlings are thrown in for purposes of making the film grounded and recognisable, it's really the robots and aliens you came to see. Nonetheless, Idris Elba and the brief yet excellent performance of child actress Mana Ashida stand out chiefly even when facing the immeasurable monsters at their doors.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is quite literally a groundbreaking feat in cinematic excellence because Guillermo del Toro immerses his audience into his world, his galaxy, his universe with relative ease, and the goal to please, which he achieves. While it has its flaws and calculates its fair share of question marks for itself, Pacific Rim is difficult to deny as anything but entertainment. It's simple, it's smashing, its scale is felt with incredible zealous. It's Pacific Rim."

","""Pacific Rim"" (12A) Director: Guillermo del Toro. Starring: Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Charlie Day and Ron Perlman. Rated: 12A for containing, frequent moderate violence and one use of strong language. Running time: 131 minutes. Out now in UK cinemas. <br/><br/>Set in the near future, beneath the pacific ocean; a portal opens which lets large monsters (called Kaiju) invade the mainland and wreak havoc upon its citizens. Soon, war breaks out and when mankind seems to be on its knees, a turn in the war occurs and the ""Jaeger"" program is launched. Two pilots mind's combine to fight, within robotic machines that could be humanities last hope of survival.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro. The man responsible for some of Cinema's most abstract and challenging pieces. He began his career with short films and gradually worked his way up into larger productions, his first being ""Cronos"". Since 2004, Del Toro has left the abstract films and moved into more mainstream films like ""Hellboy1+2"" and ""Blade 2""; but never forgetting his flair for the art in his sets. <br/><br/>He then moved back in 2006 to the fantasy genre, with ""Pans Labyrinth"". A film set during world war two, which follows the story of a young girl who instead of wanting to grow up, becomes fascinated with the existence of fairy tales. ""Pans Labyrinth"" was received well by the majority of critics. ""Hellboy 2: The Golden Army"" then followed and was met with praise on the film's special effects.<br/><br/>The idea for ""Pacific Rim"" has been in development since early two thousand and six and was passed from company to company, proving that ""Pacific Rim"" had to be of a certain standard. A popcorn movie. Del Toro was not pleased and the project was dropped from Universal Pictures; but was eventually taken up by Legendary pictures. <br/><br/>""Pacific Rim"" is undoubtedly a largely enjoyable spectacle, that is clear. What isn't clear (unfortunately) is some of the scenes including the Kaiju. Most of the scenes take place in the night time and it is fairly hard to make out who is fighting who at many points. If a sequel is going to go ahead, then my only advice would be to show more action sequences during the day. <br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly good. Charlie Hunnam is a terrific actor, who has showed us his ability in the much loved series ""Sons Of Anarchy"" (in which he plays Jackson Teller). Here, he is put in a role suited to him in which he shines. Idris Elba takes a step back from his serious career and has chosen to perform a role that can be serious, but requires little effort from the star of BBC One's ""Luther"" but is still engaging to watch. Rinko Kikuchi, a star of many independent films, has finally had her chance to show her skill in acting and break away into a more mainstream film and acts well. <br/><br/>The special effects are a joy to watch. After the success of the ""Transformer"" trilogy, films on large scales had to be improved and ""Pacific Rim"" has achieved just that. Legacy effects were hired and had worked on projects similar to this before.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Pacific Rim"" is an enjoyable popcorn film, which has brains, wit and a fair few decent fight sequences. Improvement on the night sequences would be appreciated, but if ""Pacific Rim"" has a sequel similar to this; I think I'll be willing to watch it. <br/><br/>4 STARS.<br/><br/>Written by Scott Gentry."

","Yes, giant robots are great. Yes, maybe someday they'll take their places in the army. And yes, maybe someday they'll fight for us. <br/><br/>But, when it comes to a science-fiction movie you make comparisons. And when you make these comparisons with Transformers sequels; they are far better than this one. The robots are too slow to handle a giant lizard. As they are too slow; they are always beaten to death most of the time. And if they would not be able to use all of the martial techniques; why is the training done? A game player would do a lot better than this.<br/><br/>Anyway, there was a little excitement though; i don't know why. Better do not see it...<br/><br/>UAR"

","Let me just get my one spoiler out of the way: Idris Elba's character dies, as his characters always seem to in whatever he's in. It's like he's the new Liam Neeson or Steve Buscemi, or Kenny on South Park. Anyway, I was a bit disappointed in the flick, even after going in with pretty low expectations. The main problem here is that the script is aimed so squarely at 10-year-old boys who want to see giant robots fighting giant monsters and imagine themselves as the top guns piloting those robots. If you're older than that, unless you're a fanboy of some kind, there's not much appealing about the movie. Sure, there are a lot of interesting CGI effects, mostly night scenes of intricately lit robots fighting monsters with glow-in-the-dark saliva. Everything else about the movie is just so juvenile-- the characters, the dialog, the action movie formula that anyone over 10 has probably seen dozens of times. I was hoping for much more from charismatic actors like Elba (The Wire, Luther, Prometheus) and Rinko Kukuchi (The Brothers Bloom, Babel), but they really just showed up for their blockbuster movie payday. Kukuchi, who was so intriguing in Babel and so funny in Brothers Bloom, is especially disappointing as a 32-year-old playing someone who acts like they're 17. Most of the action is filmed so close up that it's hard to see exactly what's happening, only that a giant robot is in a wrestling match with a giant sea monster. Charlie Day, who is the comic relief Giovanni Ribisi-type geeky scientist, was the highlight of the movie for me. But in the end I left the theater feeling like I'd sat too long, heard too much palaver, been punished with too many explosions and hackneyed martial arts fights, and seen absolutely nothing new.<br/><br/>I understand that Hollywood likes to make these big budget action movies with very little dialog because they do well overseas and that's a big new source of revenue. I really don't want to contribute any of my own revenue to wriggle uncomfortably in my theater seat anymore, though. Give me a script for grownups with some more originality and wit, and I might reconsider. Probably won't happen in my lifetime, but one can hope."

","I went into this movie thinking ""meh"" and I came out thinking the same thing. Not good, not terrible, just ""meh"". The big selling point in the trailer, epic fight scenes between robots and monsters really fell through. The fights were very paced and generic, not causing the audience to really care what happened to the main characters in the least. The battle scenes were also really dragged out, and became boring after the first five minutes. The characters were generic and shallow. My recommendation: if there's nothing else you desire to see in the theaters, go see this movie, but don't go in expecting much. I give this movie a five out of ten for effort, AKA: meh."
"hellojaeson","5","0","4","30 July 2013"," I Wanted to Love This Movie
","On paper it seemed like an interesting fit. Guillermo del Toro and an unusual premise of giant monsters attacking planet earth.<br/><br/>For people who appreciate his work, Guillermo del Toro is artistic, enthusiastic about film and enjoys getting great performances from his actors.<br/><br/>He was able to make Hellboy into something worthy of its own universe. It wasn't mainstream because it dealt with the darker themes of suicidal thoughts and feeling emotionally stunted. It was a film about feeling like midgets in a world of giants.<br/><br/>Then he followed that up with Pan's Labyrinth, yet another film that deals with the scary world of adults. Where monsters are real and pain is part of life. It ends sadly. Without easy answers. And he shows us even more fantastical creatures of our dark imagination. <br/><br/>In Pacific Rim, I did not feel the same sense of exploration. The same sense of being in a world created by a deep artist in search of human truth.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim invited the same themes he has explored in his most well-received works.<br/><br/><ul><li>Dark Imagination - Escaping reality through adventure - A dangerous world</li></ul><br/><br/>Notably missing are the same awesome artworks I've seen all the way in earlier films like Chronos, Mimic, Hellboy, Hellboy 2 and of course Pan's Labyrinth. <br/><br/>Largely gone are quirky designs from artist collaborators who seem to work from a deep well of twisted inspiration. Drawing on alien organic shapes merged with fairy tales and H.P. Lovecraft-esque sensibility.<br/><br/>Sure, it can be argued that employing his previous art styles may not have fit with this Japanese-inspired genre but for me its complete absence in this film made me miss the glee of design detail present in his previous art direction inspirations.<br/><br/>Before you dismiss this review as simply from someone who doesn't ""get it""... let me be clear that: I Love Japanese Monster/Godzilla/Ultraman films.<br/><br/>Growing up, these were fun to watch and I loved pretending to be a monster or Ultraman fighting them and smashing buildings and terrorizing ant-sized humans in the process. I also love the Gundam series as well as classics like Tetsujin 28 (where a young boy controls a robot). In short, I have watched Japanese cartoons (anime) and have enjoyed the usual story structure of giant monsters needing to be defeated by giant defenses.<br/><br/>That said, this was not a movie that reminded me of the B-grade rubber suit world of make- believe I grew up watching. In those old TV shows, I was too young to care about the cardboard buildings or the cheesy explosions. But then again, I was less than 10 years old.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine a young audience getting the same amount of joy from Pacific Rim. In fact, the day I watched it, I didn't feel a sense of shared joy with the audience. They didn't feel transported back to a child-like state of imagining this amazingly epic world. <br/><br/>All I sensed was an audience watching an action movie with fast cuts and a blur of heavily edited images. <br/><br/>It's a shame for me. Since there have been movies with big scale action that still considers having memorable character trans-formative moments. The films that comes to mind include The Incredibles, Batman Begins, How to Train Your Dragon and the best moments of his own great movies like Hellboy.<br/><br/>What I do hope for is that Guillermo del Toro navigates his way back to making movies that remind you artistic vision is not a lost cause. And that keeping a human emotional center isn't boring."
"amesmonde","Null","0","3","29 July 2013"," Anything it lacks is made up for in scope.
","When Earth is periodically attacked by gigantic monster-like creatures (Kaijus) that emerge from the Pacific Rim, immense Robots (Jaegers) are created and controlled by human pilots to prevent our extinction.<br/><br/>This is more linear than director Guillermo Del Toro's other films and productions, it's a popcorn summer flick which delivers on entrainment. Del Toro and writer Travis Beacham's concept is steeped in Asian mythology and pop culture, not seen since B-film Robot Jox (1989) and more recently the panned Skyline (2010). While it lacks the complexly of Del Toro's other offerings it delivers on wonderful spectacular visuals and impressive special effects. It's dark, it's oily - reminiscent of Godzilla (1998) and Del Toro's own Mimic (1997) and Hellboy (2004) in atmosphere it's still Del Toro but he makes every 12 year old dream come true in content. Comparably where Transformers (2007) felt over long and 'promised' to deliver, crammed with unnecessary padded dialogue, Rim actually delivers and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.<br/><br/>It has a memorable score by Ramin Djawadi and a powerful sound design to match. The lead actors are functional and effective enough although no one matches Idris Elba's calibre. Ron Perlman is limited to a humours extended cameo. There's the obligatory comic release characters, a character out for revenge, the doubting jock, and a guy haunted by the events from his past to name a few clichés - yes it has its Independence Day (1996) moments too but that limited cheese is addressed with the other players mocking and bringing the pretentious speeches back down to earth like a Jaeger's crashing on a Kaiju.<br/><br/>There's no smoke and mirrors it's a B-film concept with a big budget, Pacific Rim is a basic fun move with the ILM visuals being more impressive than they need to be."

","So Pacific Rim has finally landed on our screens. The Transformers Versus Godzilla, X-Men Sentinels Versus Cloverfield and monster versus robot hybrid action epic from Guillermo Del Toro. This film draws influences, whether by design or story, from a variety of sources. Not only from the above mentioned films but also Power Rangers and Robocop. It's like a mash-up of fabulous old telly, sci-fi fantasy stuff and a teenage boy's wet dream.<br/><br/>If you've missed any of the 100 trailers or TV spots then ill recap the films story. It's not complicated and unfortunately predictable. Enormous reptilian monsters have risen from the deep and are threatening the world's major seaboard cities. Only colossal Transformers-style robots can save humanity and they have to be operated by pairs of warriors attuned to each other's mental processes.<br/><br/>This is not Del Toro's best work. His best work relies on creepy, almost weird story telling. It lacks the subtle magic of Pan's Labyrinth, the creepiness of Cronos or the humour of Hellboy. What it is though is an absolutely loud and entertaining fighting robotical alien invasion apocalyptical type movie. It sells itself as nothing more and delivers just that.<br/><br/>In short the castings a bit ropey, the accents are a bit off and it's a little too long for what's on offer. There's too much human story when we really don't need it and the films humour scenes were wide of the mark. We need robots. We need aliens and we need them to fight. A lot. When what we want is delivered its fantastic – its everything that Transformers isn't.<br/><br/>The film also sets a back story that is briefly explained and allows serious prequel consideration, as should the thought of a sequel. It could have been so much better than it is, but it missed its mark by a whisker. Its good fun, good entertainment but the very high hopes I had for it failed to materialise.<br/><br/>You can read more reviews like this at fortressofsolitude.co.uk"

Then the fancy robot program gets shut down for what reason i don't now plus building a wall would not help there cause one bit late obviously the main character then has to stop the aliens coming out much like iron man in the avengers however he almost dies but doesn't. The most guessable plot ever then the main character and his girl who is only his friend almost kiss and they all live happily ever after.

Well i like almost everything about the movie though the ending just felt unjustified. If the director wants the main couple to live he could just cut the last 10min and say they ejected from the gypsy danger before they passed through the portal. Since they said that in order to pass through the portal they need to be a kaijuu or with a kaijuu so how in the world did the escape pods pass through the portal ? And if the jaegers are equipped with escape pods why didn't the marshal and the daddy boy use it before detonating the bomb ;).

","The creative maestro behind such films as 'The Devil's Backbone' and the masterpiece 'Pan's Labrynth', it is fair to say Guilermo del Toro is no stranger to dark, deep stories with heart and soul, so it is a surprise to see 'Pacific Rim' actually comes off rather light and fun.<br/><br/>To my surprise, the story of a future on Earth where mankind does regular battle with aliens, who attack from deep beneath the ocean via a bridge between their dimension and ours, lacks in development; the movie also falters with some awkward moments where the staging seems in need of a polish or a re-write. Performances are, for the most part pretty good, with a highlight being del Toro regular and fan favourite Ron Pearlman, his introduction clearly indicating how aware they are of how popular a casting choice he is. To the negative, most notable are, strangely, the male leads, who seem, at best going through motions, or at worst unbelievable. <br/><br/>All that said, however, del Toro knows precisely the film he is making here and awards courting performances did not weigh too heavily on his mind, unlike the fantastic score, which actually should go up for an Oscar next year, being one of the best elements of the movie. It should also go without saying that it is visually spectacular, grand in scope and precise in detail. Despite its lightness in tone and the fact that it is ultimately little more than a huge summer blockbuster, del Toro directs with an assured hand, the likes of which Michael Bay can only dream he had. <br/><br/>This is big, dumb fun, but really good, well designed big, dumb fun. Definitely whets the appetite for what he may have in store if he can ever get Lovecraft's 'At The Mountains of Madness' on to the screen."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","3","22 July 2013"," Big and brash, very big and very brash
","As summer blockbusters go, you don't get much bigger and much brasher than this and the whole thing is so visually bombastic that I'm glad I did not choose to see the 3D version. The pitch to the money boys who provided the $180M cost of the movie must have been simple: ""It's Godzilla meets Transformers - but bigger, much bigger"". So the threat comes from gigantic sea creatures called Kaiju (Japanese for 'strange beast') who emerge from a crack in the Pacific floor to smash up seaboard cities like San Francisco and Sydney, while the attempt to beat them takes the form of enormous robots called Jaegers (German for 'hunter') manned by two 'pilots' who need to be neurally connected (much like my wife and her twin sister), most of whom are battling internal demons as well as those ever-more colossal Kaiju.<br/><br/>The whole thing is directed and co-written by the Mexican Guillermo del Toro who crafted the wonderful ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and he has made sure that he has a cast drawn from the United States, Britain, Australia and Japan (the only woman) and located the fight back in Hong Kong to maximise the worldwide audience draw. The pacing is excellent with a really strong opening and then a gradual build up to a climax on an oceanic scale but, as so often with blockbusters, the whole thing is a bit too long. The special effects are fun, although the beasts are not as well 'drawn' as the robots, and, as well as plenty of drama and destruction, there is humour, including a pair of scientists who are human versions of R2D2 and C3PO. It's silly but entertainingly so.<br/><br/>Note: early on in the credits, there is a short extra scene."

","First, if you like Guillermo del Toro's movie, I recommend this site for a 30 days FREE trial: http://amazonprime.com--i.com/ <br/><br/>Enjoy my review below ;)<br/><br/>Going in to the summer season, there was probably no Hollywood smash hit that showed up to have as low a flooring and as high a ceiling as Pacific Rim. On the one hand, the cast is especially second-tier and the story-- huge, human-operated robots fighting huge, unusual sea monsters off the coastline of Hong Kong-- appears like a cross in between Battleship and the Transformers movies. On the other hand, the movie is routed by Guillermo del Toro, whose previous accomplishments-- both pop- cultural (Hellboy) and high-cultural (Pan's Labyrinth)-- are beyond reproach. Including weight on the negative side of the scale were a set of underwhelming trailers. However on the silver lining, again: The film is routed by Guillermo del Toro.<br/><br/>A Punishingly Overlong Lone Ranger So since Pacific Rim has landed aground, which is it? A feebly created special-effects-fest explicitly engineered for the international market? Or a job of next-generation aesthetic creative imagination? The solution, I fear, is both-- though the harmony turns somewhat towards the former.<br/><br/>The story begins in the near-future, when an interstellar portal opens deep in the Pacific Ocean and belches forth a lumbering monstrosity that desolates San Francisco. Though this ""Kaiju""-- the term is a genial nod to the Japanese giant-monster movies of the 1950s and '60s-- is eventually beat by the army, yet another unfolds 6 months later, and then yet another, and yet another. Humankind quickly comes to the conclusion that (tagline warning) to battle beasts, we have to develop beasts of our very own-- specifically, looming mechanical guys called ""Jaegers."" (The word is German for ""hunter."").<br/><br/>This setup tryings out perfectly for numerous years, with the implicit competition in between Japanese Godzilloids and German engineering regularly preferring the latter. Yet in 2020, the equilibrium of power shifts as a brand-new and more formidable species of Kaiju surface areas. Within five years, the Jaeger program is almost left. Though a few brave robot-jockeys proceed to fight the excellent battle, the program is greatly mothballed, with the governments of the globe as an alternative acquiring the construction of a huge ""Wall of Life"" planned to hold back the transgalactic interlopers. (Let's see: liberal filmmaker, border wall meant to shut out ""aliens""-- I'll offer you one estimate exactly how well this works.).<br/><br/>Permit's begin with the good: Pacific Rim's visual impacts are remarkable, in particular an early Jaeger-Kaiju fight that happens off the nighttime coast of Anchorage-- an irresistibly kinetic and immersive spin of steel sinew and reptile physical nature and sea foam. (Eat your heart out, Godzilla verse Mechagodzilla.) The last half-hour or so of the movie is in a similar way stunning-- much more Jaegers fighting even more Kaijus-- also if it does not quite reach the heights of that preliminary conflict.<br/><br/>The issue is virtually every little thing that occurs between. There are a couple of great aesthetic minutes spread here and there: a gag involving a Newton's cradle; a scenario of workers sitting on the girders of the half-constructed Wall that remembers iconic Manhattan skyscraper photos; an introductory go glancing under an umbrella in the rain that's remindful of a similar try in Hellboy. Yet total, the outlining is tiresome, the characters uninteresting, and the discussion seemingly contrived with the particular intent of eliminating nothing in the procedure of calling or subtitling. Undoubtedly, virtually every element of the movie appears designed for a smooth translation to foreign audiences, and while in some areas this is not a bad thing (the international cast, the Hong Kong establishing), essentially the outcome is a bland narrative attract the least expensive usual denominator. The motion picture's aesthetic success regardless of, Pacific Rim's biggest development might be that it's the very first Hollywood smash hit to recreation a title much less detailed of its story compared to of its designated market.<br/><br/>For Related Guillermo del Toro's movies, I recommend this site for a 30 days FREE trial: http://amazonprime.com--i.com/"

This felt more like a very biased ""Favourite Scenes""-compilation from a really really epic and really really awesome movie with the barest minimum of interconnecting scenes, so as to not let the resulting plot holes get too big. I'll be pretty disappointed if there isn't a 4 hour Extended Edition coming out for Christmas, that's for sure...<br/><br/>In some cases this brevity could of course also be interpreted as boldness. It was a bit like the film makers said, look we're not trying to pretend you do not already know this stereotype inside and out so we're not going to bore you with all the typical scenes that traditionally go with this particular character or plot element. Just fill in the blanks yourself. That's kinda cool, I guess...<br/><br/>This movie really did not feel like it did have any fluff at all (the 131 minutes really felt more like 30) - well, except maybe for the side plot with the scientists which, though cool and funny (albeit cartoony), was completely optional (i.e. it would not have made the slightest difference to the ending of the movie if they had simply been edited out).<br/><br/>But there were also so many more *hints* at epic side plots and character back stories, all of which were unfortunately not explored at all.<br/><br/>Also, I found it a bit distracting that the two ""quasi-antagonists"" (Charlie Hunnam and Robert Kazinsky) look so much alike that you could mistake them for twins sometimes. Especially in the scene where they get into a fight I always caught myself looking at the clothes for distinction which I don't think is a good sign...<br/><br/>As it is now, I would rate the movie 7.7/10 - but the Extended Edition (if it exists) might very well be a 11/10."

","Pacific Rim was a film that fanboys drooling from the mouth: it is a film about robots fighting monsters made as a homage to Japanese monster films and anime and was directed by Guillermo del Toro. But it was film that failed to connect with audiences and the early box-office numbers are underwhelming.<br/><br/>In the future a dimensional portal in the depths of the Pacific Ocean releases giant monsters known as Kaijus into our universe and attack cities across the Pacific Rim. With humanity fighting an impossible battle they create the Jaeger program, uniting to create giant mind control robots to battle the monsters. But by 2025 the only four Jaeger robots are left with few pilots, Kaiju attacks becoming more regular and politicians cutting their funding in flavour of sea wall. In desperation the Jaeger commander, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) recruits a battle scarred ex-pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) to pilot his old ship as they prepare for an attack on the portal and protect Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim is not a particular deep film, it is a B-Movie idea given a Hollywood blockbuster and a top director. If you want to you can find parallels to World War II, with the Jaeger pilots being like RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain with their numbers and equipment diminishing and the false security the sea wall offered like the Maginot Line offered to the French. Pacific Rim's plot is very basic and there are plenty of clichés in the plotting and characters but the characters are well defined and you could easily tell them apart: there did not blend together like they do in say a Michael Bay film.<br/><br/>The best aspect of Pacific Rim is the action and special effects. We get a good look of how the Jaegers function and battle a Kaiju in the middle of the ocean before a long build up to the Battle of Hong Kong. The pacing in the middle of the film is slower in the middle of the film but it gives us time to know the characters and del Toro does a great job setting up the world, from the military aspects to small grimaces of society in this world. The Battle is an epic event with a great CGI and destruction that could rival anything in Michael Bay's and Roland Emmerich's films. The action is clear, well shot and edited and it was very clear what was happening on screen. The big fights, the Jaegers and the Kaijus were flesh and inventive, the Jaegers were all very distinctive and the Kaijus were similar to the monster in Cloverfield.<br/><br/>An aspect that felt the most of del Toro's input was subplot involving Ron Perlman as a black market dealer of Kaiju body parts. Perlman was delightfully menacing in his brash dress sense and use of a beautiful knife. Perlman gave the character a brass charisma like he did with Hellboy and the iconography used in the slums had that del Toro, including the use of Kaiju skeleton as a temple. The whole black market scenes were very similar to the scenes in Hellboy II: The Golden Army. The idea of some people seeing the Kaijus as Gods and people eating Kaiju body parts was similar to the Nigerian crime lords eating the Prawns' hearts in District 9.<br/><br/>Perlman was one of the highlights from the cast. The other highlight in the cast was Elba, a popular and talented actor who oozed coolness and conviction in what he did. When Idris Elba tells you the apocalypse is cancelled, the apocalypse is cancelled! Rinko Kikuchi too was strong in her English language debut, but Hunnam was a little on the stiff side. We were also given two scientists who were comic relief, but sided more on the annoying side, particularly Burn Gorman who seemed to be trying to do his best impression of Matt Smith's Doctor Who.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim does make a theme about Raleigh and Mako (Kikuchi) both having pain and lose in in their lives and there are also parallels between Raleigh and Stacker; but the film's themes about shared memories, the Inception/Trance look of the dreamscape or the relationship between man and machine. There are also some problems involving stereotypes: the eccentric British scientist is one of them, the other is the stoic, strong silent Russians who only defined by their nationalities. There is also a plot hole about the scientists looking into the mind of a baby Kaiju, but it leads to the question how does it know anything? Plus the ending is essentially Independence Day's.<br/><br/>As well as the top notch special effects that are detailed and show the massive scale of the Jaeger, the score by Ramin Djawadi is excellent, from its Inception style horns, a deep Russian chorus and generally offered grand pieces of music.<br/><br/>In comparison to say Michael Bay's Transformers films, del Toro knew what the audience wants, giant action sequences that are clear and inventive as it homages what it is influenced by. There is a build-up of the characters, comic-relief is kept to a minimum. But this was a film that needed at least one skirmish during the character development and should have explored the themes a bit more. But it is still refreshing to see a studio taking a risk with a big budget blockbuster and letting a respected filmmaker take on the project."
"n-m-bertin","7","0","5","18 July 2013"," Awful writing, great action scenes
","OK let's cut right to the chase: the dialogue and the actors are awful. And I mean really awful, even for an action movie. The last Die Hard looks like Citizen Kane in comparison. And that's why no one in their right mind can decently put 10/10 on that movie. <br/><br/>But other than that, it kicks a few butts. First, unlike most hero movies out there, it's not limited to the US. That was especially visible in a movie which came out only a few weeks ago, Man of Steel. Here it's only about America, and as usual, Manhattan takes the hit... In Pacific Rim, you have scenes in San Francisco, Sydney, Anchorage, Hong-Kong... A team of Russians, of Japanese, you have Chinese employees, a German name for the robot etc... France is forgotten, God knows why (maybe nobody told them that Tahiti is in the Pacific...), as well as New-Zealand. Now this is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously. The ""love story"" everyone's fearing is actually hardly developed. <br/><br/>So now for the action. First of all, I've seen it in Imax 3D. This is about the best 3D I've seen in a movie. Far superior to The Avengers (which wasn't made for 3D anyway), Man of Steel, Clash of the Titans or Prometheus to name a few recent movies. It's probably neck and neck with Avatar. Except that there are no ""contemplation"" scenes, it's about 2 hours of non-stop fighting. So it can be pretty brutal for some viewers. The fights are quite inventive, and not ""polished"". This is dirty fighting, in storms, at night, in the rain etc... It's not poetic with sunny skies, unlike Evangelion which is clearly one of the influences of the movie though. Hong-Kong is nicely rendered, and the synchronized fighting (again taken from Evangelion, although modified) isn't that ridiculous (the costumes are though). I simply wished they hadn't done what everybody does : when civilians die, they don't show it. When soldiers die, it's fine, you can put it on screen. I'm tired of this... <br/><br/>So all in all, apart from the dialogues where you really have to shut your eyes in disbelief sometimes, it's a good action movie. Certainly better than Iron Man 3 or Man of Steel, because it's unpretentious."

","HOLY GUACAMOLE! Del Toro offers a Battle Royale between a group of super machines and alien beasts from beneath the ocean floor; more appropriately named Jaegers versus Kaiju. At the world's end, the only decisions to be made are those that make man more machine. Pacific Rim shows us that the human race can easily become the ants we so unconsciously step on. Did this movie have superb acting? No. Was the plot air tight? No. Were the special effects out of this world? Yes. Was this movie worth my $8.50? Heck Yes!!

"nhawdon","8","0","5","17 July 2013"," Great action, and not much else
","I came out the theater getting nothing more than I expected, which sort of annoys me. I like to be wowed, of shocked. This movie just happened. The acting in this movie was not very good, or convincing. I didn't feel very attached to the characters, and was only rooting for them because it was either them or the bad guys, who were a rowdy group of amphibious aliens who conquered planets and massacred the inhabitants for no apparent reason. Seriously, what do they get from this? Why do they do what they do? I find that this happens in many movies these days. The bad guys are only bad because they need to be bad for the plot to work. The writing was amateur, and often cliché. The ending was boring and unoriginal, and not very satisfying. All of those aspects bought the movie down.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie wasn't all bad. There were a few redeeming factors that contributed to my grade. One of them was the action and CGI. The Kaiju and Jaegers are very realistic, and when they clash, you're in for a wild ride. I am a self-professed action fan, and this movie delivered all of the action it promised. I absolutely loved the fight scenes, partly because they were shot in jaw-dropping 3D. They were also loud, explosive, and intense, and to top it all off, they were backed by an amazing soundtrack that gave me chills.<br/><br/>To sum it up, a normal summer movie, with amazing action."
"macedoniall","6","0","4","17 July 2013"," It's good but it not great
","I remember when this movie was first announced, as an anime/manga/kaiju/Del Toro fan I was hyped and excited. As the movie started to near release my excitement grew, seeing the robots and hints at the chaos in the Kaiju's wake were enough to make me feel like a little kid again watching my Godzilla movies. Even reviews were stellar for the movie and I thought it was to good to be true......and it was This movie is a good ride but it is NOT the great and awesome movie everyone is making it out to be. I understand supporting a film because it has a new fresh idea for Hollywood but that does not give a movie a free pass because this movie could have been allot better. Now if you liked the movie thats fine but I really wanted to love this movie and I only found my self just liking it.<br/><br/>Sure the plot is as thin as nails but thats to be expected and I am not holding that against this movie. Many Kaiju films have horrible plots and the reason you watch those movies is to see giant monsters destroying cities. Now this movie has great visual effects and it looks amazing. The 3-D is the best I've seen since Avatar but the action scenes were missing something, in fact the whole movie seemed to be almost reaching the peak of amazement but never reached it, so for the whole movie I felt unfulfilled and the movie felt like it was missing something crucial.<br/><br/>Now I did enjoy the movie it started out strong with an amazing opening sequence but as the movie reached the middle point it started to bog down. The action sequences didn't excite me or pump me up like when I saw Man of Steel or the Avengers. I wanted to leave the theatre wanting to run right back in to see it again. I found myself not really caring if I did see it again This has been a very strange summer, each big blockbuster has divided audiences and fans alike. Go see the movie for your self and see if you like it because allot of people were blown away. I just think the movie could have used allot more something in it because it was just a bland film in my eyes.<br/><br/>I didn't hate Pacific Rim I did enjoy myself I just expected so much more I'll see it again when it comes out on bluray and I'll probably buy it when the price drops."
"tmhughes768","7","0","4","17 July 2013"," Good, but not as good as the Critics make out.....
","Well, that was an experience. <br/><br/>Pacific Rim is a very good film with a powerful performance from Idris Elba at it's heart. It is an original story with original characters, which is refreshing in this age of comic book franchises and ""re- imaginings"". The fact the film has no big ""bankable"" star makes the film a risk in the eyes of the studio, but they overcome this with great performances all round, especially behind the camera. My problem is not with the filmmaking or the acting, it's the story. I think the story has some big leaps, some serious plot holes and a predictability that is unsatisfactory. Having said that, go see it, it's a refreshing change to all the other summer blockbuster action films."
"gt-thereelword","8","0","4","16 July 2013"," Predictable Yet Entertaining
","Pacific Rim's unwillingness to linger on explanations works beautifully. Before you know it, you've been thrown directly into the front-line of a world where robots battling monsters has become a way of life. The opening clearly and succinctly establishes a future in which mankind has created giant robots named Jaegers to go head to head against the Kaiju, colossal monsters that have entered our world via an inter-dimensional rift on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>The key to these type of grandiose pictures is the audience's willingness to accept and believe the fantastical elements as fact. Luckily, the film speeds along at a great pace and the overall design is convincing enough that it all feels plausible.<br/><br/>This is especially the case with the film's explanation of the way the Jaegers are piloted. The overall idea is that two pilots, stationed in the head of this giant machine, take care of one hemisphere each: the left and the right, much like a human brain works. In order for the two pilots to be perfectly in sync with one another, their respective brains need to meld together – so to speak. It's an interesting concept that gives the film ample room to explore the emotional ramifications of being able to share the thoughts and memories of another person. And it also ties in with the film's key theme of humanity joining forces to take control of an extreme problem.<br/><br/>Now, let's focus on this said ""problem"". The Kaiju are absolutely huge, terrifying beasts that are beautifully realized, and they look simply awesome on the big screen. The creatures are various enough to ensure they don't ever get boring or repetitive. Every time you think, ""Wow. That one is massive!"", BOOM! A new one comes along and shuts you right up.<br/><br/>As you can expect, the special effects are fantastic. The giant fisticuffs on display are definitely entertaining and surprisingly brutal. Limbs and innards are ripped out from both robot and creature. Annoyingly, these epic-scale fights do get a little repetitive. There are only so many unique ways you can see a giant robot punch a monster. And would it hurt to have some of these battles play out in the daylight? There are moments were you can see parts of these monsters and robots in sunlight, but the majority of these battles take place at night, making it harder to appreciate the details. Towards the end there was a battle that I was sure was going to happen in daylight, but no – not at all.<br/><br/>Comparisons with Transformers are inevitable. Michael Bay's massive action sequences are considered by many to be overblown and too confusing to clearly follow. The rampages here are much easier to keep track of. Del Toro makes sure that he gives you some wide shots, but I wanted more – especially with the aforementioned darkness that envelops the action.<br/><br/>The cast performs well, ensuring that the world and its mechanisms are convincing. As the lead character, Raleigh Becket, Charlie Hunnam (from TV's Sons of Anarchy) is good, but his character is probably the most underwritten of the lot. Idris Elba is the stand-out of the cast. His Stacker Pentecost is a perfect combination of tough-guy antics and caring father figure. Rinko Kikuchi is quite good as Mako Mori, a young woman who has a strong reason to pilot a Jaeger. Unfortunately, Mako and Raleigh's love-story never really convinces and ultimately fizzles out.<br/><br/>The story may be mostly entertaining, but the predictability gets quite annoying. All plot strands give irritatingly obvious signs pointing to their conclusions. Almost straight away you'll be saying, ""That guy's going to die. They'll fall in love. That won't work. That will."" Also, there are plenty of cringe-worthy moments that stick out like sore-thumbs amongst the film's other great factors.<br/><br/>Overall, Pacific Rim ticks off most of the boxes for a decent blockbuster. The special-effects are impressive, the battles are exciting and the pacing is relentless. There are a number of issues that detract from the overall experience, but this is an exciting – even exhausting – sci-fi flick that succeeds in giving enough bang for the cinema-goer buck.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thereelword.net</li></ul>"
"Laakbaar","7","0","6","15 July 2013"," Transformer-like robots battle alien water lizards
","This fairly entertaining movie is all about enormous alien water-lizard monsters fighting enormous Transformer-like robots. Sometimes they fight in or over the ocean; sometimes they fight in cities. When they fight in cities, the cities get spectacularly trashed.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the efforts of the international military/scientific force that operates the robots, and there are several side stories relating to that.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, most of the movie is based on special effects, which are sometimes quite beautiful and spectacular. It's a modern action movie in every sense of the word. This movie will appeal particularly to those who crave sensational, loud, fast and smash-filled action. It's essentially a video-game movie. <br/><br/>I thought the flashback scenes involving Mako were iconic and almost moving. This was the only time I was close to being moved during the film (rather than just sensationally titillated).<br/><br/>They picked a beautiful man to play the lead role (Charlie Hunnam), and had him play a few scenes shirtless. Not quite sure what demographic they were going for there, but it certainly worked for me. The camera loves this guy.<br/><br/>I had a few issues with certain aspects of the movie. The robot force was a strange mix of quasi-military people, scientists and martial artists. The phony, cliché and unnecessary militaristic dialogue bothered me. This was not really a military force at all, but yet they gave the characters lines like ""permission to be dismissed, sir"". Like most American movies, this movie is filled with groups yelling ""yes sir"", something you usually only see in basic training in the real military. These movies also unrealistically turn pilots and generals into infantry soldiers at the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>(A lot of movie makers nowadays have a strange notion of the military. They make it look like it is always a ragtag affair, with insubordinate behaviour and ill-disciplined mavericks playing a major role; however, at the same time they love the trappings of the military, especially the dialogue and ritualised social interactions. There are two lines in particular that indicate cliché cinematic writing: ""permission to speak freely sir"" and ""permission to approach the bench your honour"".)<br/><br/>The cliché portrayal of the scientists also rankled. It bordered on caricature. <br/><br/>I didn't buy the relationship between Stacker and Mako at all. Stacker's dialogue was ridiculous at times. The character was ridiculous, although I suppose it was ably played. It made no sense that the leader of the force fighting to save the planet would get into the tank, so to speak, to fight the battle personally. But hey that's a problem in most movies now. Even presidents are expected to be able to fight in modern American movies.<br/><br/>When did American movies stop even the pretense of showing things realistically?<br/><br/>Once again, it bothered me that the world's youth -- most of whom are grossly unfit internet and gaming addicts -- are being entertained by portrayals of people who are the exact opposite: superfit military types who are experts in martial arts. Why is it that the people who enjoy movies like this are precisely not the types who go to the gym, enjoy fighting, train for hours, or join the military. No, they watch movies showing people who do these things. Does that bother you too? We live in a world where movie makers orient their products around soft gamers living out their fantasies vicariously. The problem is that the rest of us get caught up in this dynamic.<br/><br/>This is not really a movie for adults, but it is a good example of its genre. If you like movies like this, I'm sure you'll like this one. It's not a movie for adults who worry about things like insurance rates, death tolls and marine environments, or who like to be moved by characters they care about."
"pyrocitor","6","0","4","13 July 2013"," Small pleasures in big things
","Pacific Rim is an extremely small movie about extremely big things hitting each other extremely loudly. <br/><br/>Yes, small. <br/><br/>Small in terms of scope, ideas, characterization, script rewrites, concise editing, cliché- avoidance you name it. Those moved to tears by maverick director Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth – the polar opposite on all aforementioned fronts – may find this perplexing at best, and infuriating at worst. How could a writer-director capable of such depth make a film so (contrary to its title, to use up the supply of droll turns-of-phrase) shallow? <br/><br/>The trick is to treat Pacific Rim as the world's most expensive B-movie, and all its shortcomings as intentional camp. This almost works. Indeed, there comes a gleeful sense of triumph at one of the most acclaimed working directors finally gifted with the kind of budget that has always eluded him and using it to expensively homage the tacky, under-budgeted monster movies that wowed him as a youth. However, as is common with big-budget pastiche, the tension between low-budget sensibility and big-budget expectations is never fully resolved, and the film losing its nerve in owning up to and overplaying its purposeful stupidity makes for an often-unsettling watch. Sequences of lengthy, drawn-out, predictable clichés treated as gasp-worthy plot twists occupy the dreaded purgatory between ""good"" and ""so-bad-its-good"", satisfying neither.<br/><br/>The film opens with a smirking, concise and electric guitar-fuelled montage, which establishes not only the mythology and cursory science behind 'alien attackers vs. giant robot suit defenders', but the consequences behind it – the sociocultural ramifications behind Earth being invaded, logistics of humans relocating, jaeger pilots becoming ""rock stars"", even toys and other merchandise created in tandem with the conflict. Here, with a World War Z (the book, not the film) approach to the monster genre, spectacle and smarts are effortlessly blended – Godzilla circa Jurassic Park – and hopes are immediately set high, with no reason to expect the film to falter from this point on. But, inevitably, it does, and such momentary intelligence is quickly jettisoned for a succession of Hollywood clichés hammered loudly by stale acting. Again, it is hard not to see this approach as intentional, and the film is loud and often unexpectedly funny enough to make the ride worthwhile. It is simply no longer as fun. <br/><br/>But, as with many del Toro projects, the beauty lies in the images. Or, in this case, the violence. On these fronts, Pacific Rim does not disappoint. The special effects, wedding del Toro's rubbery, stone-hewn aesthetics with CGI, are flawless. The alien kaiju are the most visually innovative monstrosities to rampage across screens in years – staggeringly large, covered in sharp edges, and throbbing with an intriguing blue light. The defenders – giant robotic exoskeleton jaegers (though subtext of German ""attackers"" versus Japanese ""monsters"" is best avoided), are equally fun, equally winking at clunky, diving-bell robots of vintage Japanese science-fiction. The film's best (and, effectively, only) plot twists lie in finding steadily more imaginative ways for the two titanic combatants to fight. <br/><br/>The destruction is appealingly vast (it is no coincidence that I heard no fewer than three separate audience members leaving the theatre griping ""But where were the Avengers already?!""). However, unlike many of the plethora of other apocalyptic releases this year, del Toro keeps the focus immediately on the seismic fisticuffs of the monster fights, rather than extending his focus out to fetishize the wanton destruction. This lends Pacific Rim a curious intimacy, and one which, in a strange way, is far more effective than any of the script's fumbling attempts at humanizing its carbon-copy humans. <br/><br/>Indeed, it is no surprise that, in the fiendish mind of del Toro, the most imaginative aspect of any character is their names. It isn't every movie in which characters named Stacker Pentecost, Hercules Hansen, Hannibal Chau, Newton Geizler, and Raleigh Becket exchange dialogue, and this in itself almost excuses the largely flat (but not flat enough) or cartoonish (but not uniformly cartoonish enough) performances. In many cases, del Toro simply supplants eccentric costuming as a shorthand to interesting character development (poor Clifton Collins Jr., being out-acted by an unfortunate bow-tie/suspenders/sideburns ensemble). And, inevitably, critiquing acting here is almost as redundant as stopping to reflect on the script's scientific liberties and purposeful misdirections (dinosaurs have how many brains?). <br/><br/>Nonetheless, Charlie Hunnam is earnest, but snooze-worthy and instantly forgettable as the latest entry in ""generic white American male sci-fi leads 101"". Idris Elba stealing the show as Marshall Stacker Pentecost (a name worth repeating twice) is a given, as Elba mines unexpected reserves of gravitas, pathos, heart, and often humour out of his steely military stereotype. His ""Do not mistake my calm exterior!"" reprimand is just as likely to be belted out triumphantly in quoting wars as his already clumsily iconic ""Tonight we are CANCELING THE APOCALYPSE!"" pump-up speech. Rinko Kikuchi, while a pleasantly unexpected piece of casting, is still too underwritten to have much to do, and the script's frequent infantilization of her reads as too tiredly patriarchal to even be played for laughs or genre convention. On the cartoonish side, Charlie Day and Ron Pearlman have oodles of fun, though Burn Gorman, who sounds like a del Toro name himself, as the requisite twitchy German(?) scientist is less welcomely so. <br/><br/>A curiosity in its ambiguous simplicity, del Toro's Pacific Rim, while always trashily fun, could easily have been 40 minutes shorter (and at least 40% better), had it bothered less with plot and characterization, which it only does begrudgingly anyway. A true triumph would be to see an alternate cut which wilfully embraces its campy stupidity and cheerful pastiche, milking the true enjoyment of its sublime creature effects. Still, for all your ""monsters vs. robots"" needs (and, let's face it, who doesn't have them?), del Toro proves a cheerfully triumphant dealer. And this is enough. <br/><br/>-6/10"
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","0","6","14 July 2013"," Falls just short of greatness
","With its neon cityscapes and giant robot battles, 'Pacific Rim' really does evoke the mecha genre of anime while also calling to mind every Godzilla movie you've ever seen to the tenth power. It's filled to bursting with great ideas, concepts and images, but a rather weak cast (besides Idris Elba, who owns in everything he's in) and poorly fleshed out characters didn't allow it to resonate like I hoped it would.<br/><br/>Characters died, I shrugged. Cities were leveled, I shrugged. It's a dazzling film, but I never once laughed or teared up. It never made the hair on the back of my neck stand up or quicken my pulse. In short; I wasn't moved. For much of its 130 minute running time it felt like watching someone else playing a video game (though certainly playing it well). There's simply too much here that's good not to recommend, but for me the whole was less than the sum of its parts."
"monkeyboxer15","7","0","6","14 July 2013"," I enjoyed it thoroughly, the movie was OK
","First off, I loved this film; it made me happy watching it. Surrounded by my friends and their popcorn, I sat and smiled contently for almost three hours. <br/><br/>Just because I loved it does not mean I am going to waste your time with a 10 out of 10 review. It was certainly entertaining, but I'm afraid that they were afraid of taking this film to its maximum potential.<br/><br/>Let's start with the action: It was amazing... half the time! The crunching blows delivered from giant robots, and the cheezy attacks that all giant robots are made to have provided some heart-pounding, action-packed fights. But then a different shot. The camera was thrown all over the place and the flashy lights made for a continuation of havoc, but the fight was gone. There were no monsters or robots, just shaky lights and loud noises, or blurred shots of convoluted combat. It's cheaper to film this way, but it was done far too much. <br/><br/>The plot: cliché, but did keep continuity. The plot had flow, and the story was well-paced and kept a good feeling of urgency, but there were some aspects of the film that could have easily been replaced with more cleverly written lines and action. Some of the plot's predictable quirks were enjoyable and the film would suffer without them, simply, because they were fun. The rest of the story, however, was far too predictable and it wouldn't have taken much effort (or funds) to mix it up a bit. <br/><br/>The acting: great, that's it. It was great. Some of the acting avoided being wonderful because of the predictable story. Knowing what would happen next and then finally seeing the shot where they react was uneventful, but the whole time everyone was believable and did well. There were two very enjoyable actors. They provided jokes, like-able characters, and good development. I think they will be a deciding factor for this movie. They were funny and without them this movie would lack any comedy. You'll know who I mean.<br/><br/>The production values were high, the majority of the time, and the film was just flat out fun to watch. It's worth seeing, even just for the epic shots of monster smashing. <br/><br/>If you avoid violence, then don't see the film. It's violent - a little gory with the monster beating. That's mostly the point of the film, and they did a really good job with it. <br/><br/>My favorite part of the film was the sound effects and music. The sound clenching my ears was always thrilling. The monsters were fierce and the soundtrack took the fights from cool to brutal (the good kind).<br/><br/>If you hate clichés or violence you'll be disappointed. If you don't hate cliché's or violence, or can at least tolerate them... well, then you'll probably enjoy this film, at least for some giant pugilism.<br/><br/>ByKy"

","When I was much younger than I am today, I played a certain PlayStation 2 game named War of the Monsters, in which giant monsters fight each other. The game, despite lacking intelligence, was extremely fun and enjoyable. When I heard Guillermo del Toro was making a blockbuster movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters, I instantly thought of War of the Monsters, and I must admit, I was skeptical. But, at the same time I knew that the only person that could pull off a movie like this was del Toro – the genius behind great movies like Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2. The final result certainly wasn't awful, but it wasn't amazing either.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim's plot is set in a not so distant future in which giant monsters named Kaijus start coming out of the Pacific and attacking major cities world wide. Humanity, as a response, creates giant robots named Jaegers, which need to be piloted by two people, to fight off the creatures. This method seems efficient at first, but eventually more menacing monsters emerge and slowly start destroying the Jaegers. In such a defeat, our main character Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) loses his co-pilot and brother Yanci (Diego Klattenhoff). This tragic loss forces him to retire from piloting Jaegers. But obviously, in a not so unpredictable turn of events, he starts piloting Jaegers again, aided by a new copilot – a young Asian woman named Mako Mori who seeks revenge against the Kaijus.<br/><br/>In a big blockbuster 'robots vs monsters' movie like this one, many people were afraid of how del Toro would deal with the human aspect of the movie, so let's get that out of the way first. The human aspect of the movie is satisfying. Of course, it's not spectacular but it's developed just enough not to make you bored during the pauses between the action scenes. The main character Raleigh Becket is somewhat bland and one-dimensional and the actor who plays him, the anonymous Charlie Hunnam, does have clingy acting abilities, but all of that is overshadowed by other characters and actors in the movie. Idris Elba is great as the marshal Stacker Pentecost, Rinko Kikuchi gives a convincing portrayal of Mako Mori and Guilermo del Toro's favorite, Ron Perlman, is terrific in his semi-cameo role. There are also two scientists in the movie – Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) – who were rather interesting and likable. So I'd say the movie tackled the human aspect just fine.<br/><br/>Now that we got the human aspect out of the way, let's talk about the real reason why everyone wanted/wants to see this movie – monsters and robots. Both the Kaijus and Jaegers look absolutely amazing. There are several different designs of both these groups of giants, and each one looks amazing and special in its own way. So props to the effect designers/visual designers or whoever actually created and realised the Jeager/Kaiju designs. The action scenes are brilliantly shot and edited. The majority of the action (as you can see in the trailers) takes place in the night time, but it's very effectively actualised so you can properly see everything that's going on. So, regarding the robot/monster aspect of the movie, Pacific Rim is one fun, entertaining and amusing summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Of course, not all in Pacific Rim is milk and honey. The main problem with the movie is that it's too loud and that does get tedious after 2 hours. Buildings being destroyed, metal screeching, monsters shrieking, explosions and other irritating noises are constantly present in Pacific Rim. Because of this, after the movie was over my ears were aching. So, in spite of how fun the movie may seem, I surely won't see it again, at least not on the big screen. The other problem with the movie was the ending, which was underwhelming. The final fight is quite disappointing, considering how other fights in the movie were more engaging. However, I think I would recommend Pacific Rim, especially since it's not like there's something much better currently playing in theaters. But if you want to enjoy your viewing experience even more, I'd advise to bring a pair of earplugs along.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"

","Eye candy, ear candy and mind candy! I will endeavor to be general and not spoil anything!<br/><br/>As always with a DT movie, the visuals were great, from the giant robots (Jaegers), the monsters (Kaiju), to the China Town extras. Nice variety in Jaeger/Kaiju designs and abilities made for a 'I-wonder-what-a-live- action-Evangelion-would-look-like' moment for me. Even the cockpits of the Jaegers varied with the generation. Most of the case wore military uniforms, but the pilot's suits were well designed(made me think 'Mass Effect'). I've always like DT's visuals and PACIFIC RIM doesn't disappoint. I watched in IMAX 3D, but this movie would still look great in 2D.<br/><br/>Although overall it worked, the only aspect I personally found not as strong as other elements was the soundtrack. Nothing against the composer, just a personal thought. Some pieces really carried the feeling of epic triumph while others were 'just adequate' Hard for me to explain, but I think everyone's had those moments where certain pieces stand out, while others just seem okay.<br/><br/>Storywise, it's a classic 'Save the Earth' theme with 'dealing with consequences' underlying it. Plenty of robot vs monster action to keep the viewer engaged with enough talking head scenes to balance the action out. That being said, I like that the relationship between Hero and Heroine is not based on anything romantic (at least my perception) but rather their desire to get past traumas in their personal history. The two researchers are a good comedic elements to watch bicker as they attempt upstaging one another amid the prominent tone of 'impending human extinction.' On a personal note, Perlman is always fun to watch. Pacing felt good. The movie runs around 130 minutes but doesn't 'feel' that long as opposed to other movies that really felt longer than their running time. I could sit through another viewing of 'Pacific Rim' but not 'Dark Knight Rises.' Both good movies in my opinion, but I never thought DKR would end...<br/><br/>Overall, I don't think there's much objectionable for a 'PG-13' viewer other than occasional 'adult' language and some intense scenes (mock me me for that if you will, but there are some ways I DON'T want to die shown in the movie!) If you remember the good ol' rubber suit monster days, have seen enough Gundam (and it's like) or just want to enjoy an 'original' movie without a number behind it that's actually enjoyable, go watch this movie! And stick around for the mid-credit scene!"

","Ever since I was a kid I've loved monster movies. Films like Godzilla versus MechaGodzilla, the 7th Voyage of Sinbad and King Kong versus Godzilla got as much playtime for me as a kid as did Star Wars or Batman. B-movies have a certain charm to them, they usually have paper- thin human characters blended with whatever alien or monster element is providing the special-effects draw of the film. <br/><br/>Pacific Rim is the perfect blend of old-world B-Movie schlock and new world visual effects. The human characters are caricatures or thinly veiled stereotypes, their backstories are predictable and so are most of their actions in the film. You can guess what's coming a mile off. Just from the trailer you can guess the basics and yet, with as stupid as the plot is, when they get into the giant Mechs (Jagers) and start battling monsters the spectacle of it is jaw-dropping. You really feel the sheer weight and size of these things, both the Kaiju and the Jagers, which is no small feat considering how hard it is to convincingly portray mass and size with CGI. There's something about traditional model making that makes it easy to get a sense of weight and scale but here the visuals manage to show us, and more importantly let us feel, just how toweringly massive these behemoths truly are.<br/><br/>Even with a by-the-numbers plot I still found myself rooting for the Jagers every single time they faced a Kaiju. The adrenaline rush of seeing the two pilots move with the machine, all their will-power, all their memories, merged to fight this threat. Metal getting sheered, torn, battle-damage to the Jagers, monster bodies crashing through buildings. <br/><br/>When I was a kid there was a film called Robot Jox that used stop-motion for the giant mechs. With modern CGI we've come a long way. Rather than try to get gritty or grim or realistic the film stays true to its schlocky silly predecessors.<br/><br/>If this film had come out when I was twelve it would have changed my life forever. It's an awesome sight to behold that leaves you pumped. This is a film that admits what it is up front, if you've seen the trailer than you know what to expect. It is a homage that blends the plots of a thousand other monster movies into a perfect blend of pure visual cinematic awesome.<br/><br/>In short, it ain't perfect, but its the most entertaining film I've seen this summer. If giant monsters battling mechanized soldiers doesn't put you in a theater what are you seeing, a comedy? On the big-screen? For shame. Go see Pacific Rim!<br/><br/>PS. Portal fans, her voice IS in the final cut of the film!"

","The Pacific Rim 2013 Movie is an American sci-fi film directed by Guillermo del Toro, written by del Toro and Travis Beacham which stars Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Rob Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman aka Hellboy:D and the film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is under attack by Kaiju, a colossal monsters which have emerged from a portal on the ocean floor. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, a gigantic humanoid mecha each controlled by two pilots whose minds are joined by a neural bridge. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket who is a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori in a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju and save the Earth from the apocalypse. http://goo.gl/M82KS"
"jojifrey","7","0","7","12 July 2013"," I. Like. This. Robots. Movie.
","This movie is by far THE BEST ROBOTS MOVIE ever made. Okay, it may not be as breathtaking as Transformers in the audio perspective, but the making of famous Japanese Gundam-like robots into Hollywood movie made this piece of work a marvelous add for the future robot movies.<br/><br/>The storyline is definitely full of cheesy anime dialogues, the actors I have seen none of them are famous enough to be on my Hollywood radar (except Ron Perlman), but the directing, art, graphic, visual aid are very much superbbb!<br/><br/>I love the geeky professor SNL star Charlie Day and antagonist character played by Hanibal Chau, they really stole the scenes.<br/><br/>What really made this movie worked was the director.<br/><br/>Great job, Guillermo del Toro!"
"poet512","7","0","7","12 July 2013"," PACIFIC RIM has Toys for the Big Boys
","PACIFIC RIM brought me to my childhood days when Ultraman was fighting with monsters. Story goes with aliens rising beneath our ocean floor and invading the entire earth for some reason (watch the movie). Because the aliens are huge (pre historic days and behave like a drunk King Kong), governments from across the globe united to create an elite team to combat these aliens in the form of engineered robots (Jaegers) with distinct fighting gears. The catch is its mostly a two man vessel connected to a neural bridge. Huh? Since its a large robot one person serves as the right brain while the other the left. Their memories are merged and their brains (not literally) as well to serve as one main CPU for their android. To cut the story short, they need to kill the monsters (Kaiju) to save human race. To make it long, to top that we have a melodramatic lead actor and his sidekick, a drama queen as well. Too many characters playing certain roles to extend the movie more than two hours. It has too much testosterone that it felt like watching 300. Their plot may fall short but Ill give them two thumbs up for technicalities and attention to detail. When the movie ended, I wanted to be a Jaeger because I got moves like jagger (now laugh). Overall, it's a visual effects feast and what's interesting is our annoying seatmate whose queries are due to his disconnection from the movie. If only he was not sleeping. 3 out of 5 popcorns"
"aldri-feb","7","0","7","12 July 2013"," Man vs monster at it's best
","In the future time, there's giant monster called ""Kaiju"" which has risen from beneath of Pacific ocean and ready to overtake earth. Some teams try to beat the monster by jet and tank but it takes many days to defeat it. To level the combat, special forces from around the world build robots named ""Jaegers"". ""Jaegers"" is operated by 2 pilots whom minds are locked into one so they could move the robot based on their movement.<br/><br/>""Spectacular"" is the best word to describe 'Pacific Rim'. All of the action scene is captured really detail from the fight in the water, land or even on sky although it seems length of the movie is too short for massive problems like that. They tells first Kaiju's attack in fast way and just skip through the existing of ""Jaegers"". Also there's a little bit let down in storyline about human. It feels too boring and standard in storyline which is unusual for a high class director like Guilermo del Toro. And one of the most fatal mistake is there are no well-known actor here who could support this movie and make it more commercial. The actors don't act bad though, but in a summer big-budget movie, they should hire at least one popular actor as main role. Overall 'Pacific Rim' is one of the most satisfying movie at this summer season, it's big, fantastic and fun. Most credit should be given to the special effects members who create the combat between robot and monster look real. Also the IMAX 3D is incredible and worth to see. Unfortunately 'Pacific Rim' suffers with weak storyline that makes it flaw."
"rgkarim","Null","0","5","12 July 2013"," Action Packed Fun on the Pacific
","Action fans rejoice, for Pacific Rim has come to deliver the robot vs monster goodness the trailers tempted us with earlier this year. With stunning visuals, this movie does what its predecessors failed before to focus on the titans and not on the supporting humans, well at least not all the time. Battles involve adapting combat strategy and blending weapons with martial arts leading to some epic challenges that span for minutes at a time instead of a thirty second blast to the spark chamber. Combine this with the intense soundtrack and you get a collection of sequences that draw you into the adventure you've been craving for most of the summer. The plot isn't bad either, but movie goers like me will see how much they knocked off from other films. These mashed dynamics were nicely edited together, but I'll admit there are some tie-ins that are a bit overstretched for my taste and a bit lazy on their part. Unfortunately, the team failed the challenge of balancing combat between robots. Once again they built up an epic arsenal of robotic warriors, only to fail on giving them screen time, many having about four minutes of glory. Sorry, but what's the point of making these things if you're only going to focus on Optimus, I mean Gypsy. There are a few other things that this movie fails on, but overall it's a fun time at the movies, and in my opinion worthy of a trip to the 3-D cinema.

"lyk-nicolaas","7","0","6","11 July 2013"," AMAZING! Jaeger!! BUT...
","I don't know what to say actually but lets say ""AMAZING EXPERIENCE"" on this movie. I love a battle to save the world. This movie is kicked ass. I wish I can see another series like this, but this time it would be more robots from around the world, as well as stronger story. I want to watch it again because this movie was too fast to understand right away. I need to watch it again so that I going to like it more. As far as no; story, fights, and the robots are not enough. I need more. The idea of this movie was really good. Bring out all the nostalgic when we were a kid and watching the ""Power Ranger"" with a giant robots etc. So, maybe that is the only ""kick"" of this movie so far. <br/><br/>Please release the director's cut for this movie!! And I wish it will be a better one."
