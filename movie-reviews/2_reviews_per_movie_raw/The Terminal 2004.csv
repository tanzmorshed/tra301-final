"CalRhys","Null","97","111","8 July 2014"," A Feel-Good Dramedy That Explores Humanity
","Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, two of the biggest names in Hollywood, two people who could literally make any film they wanted to, and instead they settle on a feel-good dramedy... good thinking Steven. 'The Terminal' is a charming adaptation of a true story about a foreign civilian stuck in an American airport terminal lounge after his country faces war. The thing that makes this film worth watching are the excellent performances from the amiable cast and the sympathetic direction from Spielberg. After watching some of the behind the scenes as well, I was amazed at how the crew had built a full-size replica airport in a hangar in LA complete with working escalators, the attention to detail is astounding, and this makes the film that much more worth sitting through. 'The Terminal' is an entertaining comedy-drama that explores humanity and sentimentality, a spectacular flick from Spielberg and Hanks."

","Yeah, it might be unrealistic and cheesy at times but it's still a great movie and pleasant to watch. It's heartwarming and has humanity to it along with cute comedic moments. Tom Hanks Russian accent seems forced in the beginning but I quickly got use to it and seemed natural afterwards. Tom plays a very naive and yet kind hearted guy name Viktor Navorski who can't leave the airport terminal because of certain circumstances. And Stanli Tucci put on a believable performance and fit the mood of this movie well. He plays a Frank Dixon who is the head of security at the airport this movie takes place. And is the one that gives Navorski the most difficult time but without him there wouldn't be this story. The comedic moments in this movie really works and is a film the whole family can enjoy. The different scenarios come together in a delightful manner and that is what this film is, it's delightful and entertaining. So parts just seem way too far-fetched and underdeveloped. But that is passable because this isn't suppose to be a really realistic film. In fact it sorted reminded me of ""Forrest Gump"" except it takes place in a terminal. Overall this is a movie that adults and kids can enjoy.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","It's funny how Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, two of Hollywood's most powerful men, who could literally do any movie they want, end up making something like The Terminal. Instead of reaching for new heights of film-making like including the latest in special effects, or new original ways of storytelling and editing, Spielberg goes back to a simpler form. That in itself is surprisingly refreshing. Filmmakers try so hard to be inventive and change the typical form of the classics, that when someone finally does go back to that Capra or Wilder fashion, it ends up seeming original. That's what The Terminal goes for. A movie about characters, not plot. About emotion, not CGI. It's a true heart-felt piece of work. It's funny, it's cute, and it always keeps you interested.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks leads an exceptional cast as Viktor Navorski, a man stranded in JFK airport, not welcome in the U.S. and having no country to come home to. Throughout the experience he makes friends, a love interest, and a rival. He changes all of their lives, of course. That's to be expected from a movie like this. Tom Hanks is totally believable, accent and all. It's a performance well worthy of an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>I loved The Terminal for many reasons, but one big reason is it's simplicity. And more importantly, because it is good at being simple. It doesn't contribute anything new to movies, it doesn't try to. It is what it is. A great, feel-good film. Something that is getting rarer and rarer these days. Sometimes you'll want to see a gritty, wrenching melodrama, but other times you'll want to see The Terminal.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"

","I've seen some really good movies in 2004 but so far, this maybe the best. The Terminal is an incredible fairy tale of a movie-it's quietly captivating, rich in interesting colorful characters and superbly acted and directed.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks as Victor Navorsky is quite simply entrancing to watch. He is an amazing character actor and in The Terminal he again creates a character who is instantly embraceable. You care about Victor and want things to turn out OK for him as much as his friends in the Terminal do.<br/><br/>This is a movie that actually got some bad reviews and I'm baffled by why. Although, I usually can see flaws in even the movies I think are 8's and 9's there isn't much to be critical of here. Some people have said it's to ""feel good"". That it's lacking in reality. I don't necessarily see those as negatives, there are many good movies that are feel good or unrealistic, just as there are some bad ones. The Terminal has a lot that's likable about it. <br/><br/>Firstly, there's Hanks himself and I will admit if any other actor had played Victor it might not be the movie it is, Hanks is simply amazing, you forget who he is within the first five minutes. I won't mention everyone by name, but the rich array of supporting actors/actresses were all good as well. It is an unusual movie that really isn't either a straight comedy OR a straight drama-it perhaps falls through the cracks of genres but I'd call this mostly a heartwarming and completely absorbing character study of one man's attempt to make a life for himself in an airport terminal. It's a very different type of movie-for all the strategically placed product adds, there's something quietly uncommercial about Terminal and watching it is an interesting experience. <br/><br/>The movie is about 2 hours and you get a lot in those two hours. For me what was striking was how genuinely interesting this movie turned out to be. I'm one who finds airport terminals fascinating anyway-all the hundreds of and thousands of people rushing about to hop on a plane and start some new adventure....but to actually live in a terminal-an interesting (and rather strange) concept-Hanks acting here is quiet and understated and at a level surpassing merely ""talented"". He manages to make nibbling a cracker fascinating. I would give this a 10 of 10 and know there are many who may think it's not for them but I found this movie to be a beautiful fairytale of a picture and hope at least Hanks gets an Oscar nod. I also hope that skeptics give this movie a chance-as good a movie as any Hanks film I've ever seen. 10 of 10."

","An Eastern European (Tom Hanks) from a fictional country literally gets stuck at JFK Airport in New York after his landing coincides with the point at which a war causes his nation to no longer exist. Thus his paperwork and passport are no good. Hanks is in the U.S. for a mysterious reason and that reason becomes the hook in this wonderful picture. While stuck, Hanks sees more of America than he could have ever imagined. However he constantly has trouble with airport supervisor Stanley Tucci (in a perfect role). Runway worker Diego Luna makes a deal with Hanks so he can learn about passport officer Zoe Saldana (a woman who Luna has loved from afar) via Hanks' attempts to have his passport accepted. Also Hanks meets an elderly Indian janitor (Kumar Pallana) who has been in the states for decades, but the reason he is there also becomes a key point. While all this goes on, Hanks falls in love with 30-something flight attendant Catherine Zeta-Jones (perfectly illuminating and beautiful as usual). Zeta-Jones is sad and disillusioned with men (Michael Nouri of ""Flashdance"" in particular) and past relationships that have failed for one reason or another. Director Steven Spielberg has never really been known for romantic pictures (""Always"" in 1989 is an exception), but he proves that he can definitely handle a production like this. The cast is excellent with Hanks making all those around him better. This story was co-written by Andrew Niccol (even though he strangely did not pen the final script), an under-rated screenwriter who struck gold in 1998 with ""The Truman Show"". Many of the good things from that script are also presented here in diverse and creative ways. By the way, the art direction/set decoration is amazing as everything within the titled location was built from scratch in a studio. Spielberg was not allowed to film any airports due to obvious security reasons. From top to bottom, ""The Terminal"" flies high. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

","I have to say it is a great one that first shows the meaning and beauty in our life about waiting and promise. Amelia is waiting for her dream to come true for eighteen years, for herself; Navorski's dad was waiting for something he honored so much for his life; and here comes Navorski, who waits for making his father's left dream come true, for fulfilling his promise, for the woman he fell in love, in a ""crack"" between the US and his own country. <br/><br/>He has done everything for others around him. If there is a great example of ""egoless"", he is one. Letting go ego, is the greatness that even Amelia found out when she gives up and scarifies something most important in her life to help Navorski. <br/><br/>This simple story conveys some wonderful philosophy for people living in this country busy around everyday for business, families, and so on, to slow down and reflect on something. As the retired officer said to officer Dixon, there is something we can learn from Navorski."

","Although I should not have been surprised, Spielberg and Hanks, had greatness written all over it. But I got suckered into a lot of the bad press around the film and suppose I judged it before I had watched it. Anyway, I have now watched it and I liked it.<br/><br/>I thought the first half of the film was absolutely fantastic, the humor, the acting, the character development - they were all good. I thought the second half of the film suffered a little from becoming a bit over emotional, the love story seemed out of sorts and the way the entire airport staff seemed to know every thing about everyone else was a bit far fetched, I worked in an airport for many years and knew virtually no-one from outside the people I worked with on a daily basis, but maybe that's just me! But I forgave the film these slight nuances and allowed myself to enjoy it. I don't think Hanks or Spielberg will win any more Oscars, but it was a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday night!!"

","'The Terminal' is the latest Hanks/Spielberg collaboration, and though it's not quite as good as 'Catch Me if You Can' or 'Saving Private Ryan' it still makes for a fun watch. The plot, as everyone already knows, is about Krakozhian (sp?) immigrant Victor Narvorski (Tom Hanks) whose home country  the fictional land of Krakozhia (think Russia or Czechoslovakia)  is torn apart in war while he is in a plane headed for New York. When he lands JFK airport head Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) tells him that since he literally doesn't have a country he must stay in the airport terminal until all the hoopla settles. Dixon thinks that Narvorski will ignore him, escape into New York and 'become someone else's problem'. What Dixon doesn't know is that Victor is an honest man, and he will obey the rules and stay in the terminal until he's allowed to leave.<br/><br/>The character of Victor Narvorski is one of those classic movie characters who has no conceivable flaw (other than a minimal understanding of the world around him  and an accent) and dose everything he can to help everyone else. Similar characters that spring to mind are Peter Sellers' Chauncey Gardner from the 1979 satire 'Being There' and John Goodman's Charlie Meadows from the Coen movie 'Barton Fink'. All of these characters are dim-witted, but great people who put their own lives on hold to help their friends.<br/><br/>Some of these friends include Airport worker Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), who Victor helps get hitched with a beautiful security guard (Zoë Saldana) and Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a nice, flighty flight attendant who Narvorski inspires to get out of a troubled relationship with a married man.<br/><br/>The Hanks and Zeta-Jones characters strike up a little romance, but luckily its not too overblown, it's more of a subplot than anything.<br/><br/>It takes sometime but soon Narvorski is accepted into a small group of Airport workers including Cruz, kindly Joe Mulroy (Chi McBride) and janitor Gupta Raja (Kumar Pallana), who at first thinks that Narvorski is a federal agent out to get him. These characters are all well written and even better acted, but I thought they could've been awarded with a little more screen time. After all, the three are very good actors. But I guess Luna is still riding off the success of 'Y U Mama Tambien' and McBride, despite the fact that he's been working for many years, is still trying to find a big role that's right for him (which I doubt he'll get from 'I, Robot').<br/><br/>It's Pallana who has the biggest role here, and man, does he deserve it. Very old, and very foreign, he was brought to surprising cult fame when Wes Anderson gave him the role of 'Pagoda' in the 2001 hit 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. Who doesn't remember the short, quiet, hilarious butler of the Tenenbaum family? His role in this is a great follow-up; he is funny, and surprisingly touching and dramatic in a very tense scene near the end that I wont spoil. In any other movie the role of the Indian janitor would be an easy target, but this character isn't funny because he's Indian, but instead funny because he's clever, a little cynical and wily. He stole every scene he's in from under Tom Hanks, or Zeta-Jones, or whoever. This is a long shot, but I think the man deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is the greatest factor  well, that and the huge Terminal set built only for the movie. Some critics are complaining about an underwritten and underused Catherine Zeta-Jones. Whatever. I call her under-necessary (Note: not UNnecessary, UNDER-necessary). I'm glad that her less-than-interesting character wasn't overused, I'm glad the movie wasn't turned into a straight-out romance.<br/><br/>The films deepest and most interesting character is Tucci's Dixon. On the surface he looks like your usual villain, but that's only to simpleton viewers who don't make any attempt to understand their movie characters. Dixon is not a villain. As it's established in the beginning, Dixon has been working the same job at the airport for seventeen years and wants desperately to climb up the latter. Because of this, he makes sure that he follows every single rule; he's the epitome of every by-the-book bureaucrat that we all love to hate. His motto is that in his work there're three important things, 'The person, the document and the story'. In the best scene of the movie Dixon refuses a Russian man to bring medicine to his dying father in Canada because he doesn't have the right form. This scene represents everything about the character of Dixon.<br/><br/>I was also interested in the relationship between Dixon and Narvorski. Dixon is at first refusing Narvorski because it's the rules, but as the film goes on and Dixon is further perplexed by Narvorski it stops being about rules and starts being about hatred and jealousy for Narvorski's joyful existence. He refuses to let Narvorski go to New York when he should be allowed to. In the film's most fulfilling scene Narvorski escapes and Dixon decides to give up chasing him, and you can see in his eyes that he's realized how ridiculous and stubborn he's been acting. This is Tucci's best performance. An Oscar for him, I say!<br/><br/>It is flawed, of course, in a few things. Narvorski's character is never developed, he stays the same person throughout the entire film, but that's fine, because Hanks keeps your interest and is at his most lovable. Also, the ending stretched on just a little bitif I had my way it would've ended with Dixon happily watching Narvorski escape in his cab, the rest could've just as easily been implied. I think the ending is a very important part of any film, and this one was  in a way  ruined.<br/><br/>But, no movie is perfect, and I have no problem accepting this as a lighthearted picture with a few interesting characters. Have fun. 7.5/10."

","I liked The Terminal. I liked all of the people and all of the situations.<br/><br/>Most people who saw this liked the minor characters especially Gupta who took particular delight in watching people slide on his wet floor.<br/><br/>That was fine, but not to be difficult I liked the courtship between the very shy but proper food delivery person and the immigration official better. Navorski was kind gentle and wise as acting as their Cyrano. He neither fell in love with nor did he take advantage of her.<br/><br/>The Terminal is a romance in the tradition of (say) Picnic. As a teenage, I watched with envy as William Holden easily courted a beautiful, vulnerable younger Kim Novac. What did it matter that he was old enough to be her father? The girls in movie houses still drooled over him and wished they were her. <br/><br/>So with this. Most male reviewers take exception to Zeta Jones in The Terminal. Much more sophisticated these days. Pity. She was actually quite good. She was like the little Mermaid: much of what she conveyed could not be done with her voice. The same thing with the Zeta Jones character: everything she said had to be done with her eyes and tears. She knows Navorski's value. She knows his character and how good he is. She wants him and is certain he wants and deserves her, but she knows that sooner or later she will betray him and that would devastate him. She knows herself so well that she feels unworthy of him. She cannot betray such a good and honorable man. What then does that make her? Is she any less honorable and worthy? Should she be any less desirable for the boys than William Holden for the girls? <br/><br/>This film is not Schindler's List. But it's not Beach Blanket Bingo either. It is a wonderful character study well worth seeing."

","The Terminal (2004): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride, Zoe Saldana: Dramatic comedy about life's dark periods. When war breaks out in his country an Eastern European citizen becomes stranded in a New York airport unable to leave. He understands little English but makes the best of his situation. Structure is sometimes disjointed but surprises when the mystery is revealed regarding the peanut can he possesses. Spielberg gives a detailed feel to airport operations. This marks the third collaboration between director and star, after previously helming Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can. Tom Hanks is superb as someone out of his element yet adapts when all else fails. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a stewardess down in relationships yet she finds friendship and freedom with this peculiar foreign fellow. Stanley Tucci plays an airport commissioner who tries to maintain order yet ultimately must face the fact that his terminal sleepover guest is not quite the hindrance he at first thought. Chi McBride plays a security guard who sympathizes with Hanks. He shifts through disjointed moments yet performs with appeal. Zoe Saldana plays an immigration officer and, like McBride, the role is standard fair and barely elevates above plot conventions. This is a rewarding film about conquering life's hardships.

","Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has just arrived from Krakozhia in JFK Airport, when there is a coup in his small eastern country, with the revolutionary forces taking the government by force. The USA does not recognize the new government and the validity of his VISA and passport are canceled. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the bureaucratic administrator of the airport, who rules by the book and does not show any compassion for people, leaves Viktor, who does not speak English, in the international lounge of the airport with a problem without solution. While patiently living in Gate 67 for a long period, Viktor survives, learns English by himself, makes new friends among the employees of the airport and falls in love for Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). ""The Terminal"" is a delightful and uncommon fable about a patient man who is trapped by the bureaucracy in the international lounge of JFK. I heard that an equivalent event would have happened indeed in Paris, but there is no reference on the DVD, and the writer takes the credits for the idea of this theme. Anyway, Steven Spielberg is really magic, and was able to make a delightful movie with such a weird storyline.

The Terminal is a lightweight movie.

The cast is great and all of them have delivered commendable performances. The writing offers enough laughter and some touching moments. One negative aspect of the film is the littering of product advertisements in nearly every scene. <br/><br/>To sum up, Spielberg, his actors and writers have woven the movie into a crowd-pleasing and entertaining film about humanity and heart, that creates sympathy for all its characters through its entire flow and leaves the viewer unreasonably happy at the end.

(I am security guard at the international airport in St. Louis on the graveyard shift) I figured it would be enough to bore me to sleep, but instead I was laughing every other minute becoming more and more awake. I really enjoyed the comedy side of the film. I enjoyed the supporting cast as well, Kumar Pallana as Gupta the Indian janitor is simply marvelous. Torres the immigration officer is a shining light. Barry Henley was dour and sobering as usual, but endearing. Diego Luna was a little hyper, but good. Chi McBride seemed exactly like his role on the John Larroquette Show. Stanley Tucci as Dixon was marvelous as well, he really has that knack for explaining a complete inability to be annoyed without being just plain mean back. I just plain enjoyed it and it had it's downs like any movie, but hey it's a movie and it's implausibly plausible. I just wish I had people this entertaining working in my airport."
"ico_mate_vt","10","27","48","8 July 2006"," excellent plot, excellent acting
","If have to be honest, when I saw the title for the first time, I thought that this would be just another lame comedy, but I was completely wrong. The film was fabulous, very profound and at the same time very entertaining. I think that this is tremendous story equally interesting for the Eastern Europeans and the rest of the world, but I'm sure that both sides look at the movie from different point of view. I'll give you mine. I'm 23 years old Bulgarian and when I was watching the movie with my father, we had completely different reaction. I couldn't stop laughing, while he was almost crying. And then I realized that he saw himself in Tom Hanks character. The fact that Navorski speak in Bulgarian, even enhanced the feeling. Tom Hanks did an excellent job, because he managed to show the world, how all Eastern Europeans over 50's feel when they go in United States. It would be very stressing, confusing and even shocking for a man coming from deep countryside of eastern country, who has never seen such a big airport, TVs everywhere(his first reaction was to try to turn the volume up manually), with very poor English, and on the top of all his country is in war and he is forced to live at the airport, where he must survive without any support, money and a lack of any kind of information(absence of interpreter). The thing I liked the most, is that with Victor Navorski, is shown the typical for Eastern Europe compassion, understanding, inventiveness, integrity, frank communication and simply to be friendly. Although Navorski knew that he will cause himself a lot of troubles by helping the Russian guy that he hadn't known, he lied to save him. Why he did that, this is something that Americans will never understand. In Eastern Europe, the people are not always kind and polite, but most of the time, they are sincere, real friends and help each other without looking for any kind of benefits. They keep their promises and will never betrayed their friends. That's why he decided to leave the USA without getting in New York and carry out his mission, just because he could put his friends in danger. On the other hand, the typical American behavior is also very well present. The security chief was always falsely smiling and polite, but in fact, he was cruel, heartless and the only thing he was caring about is how to get rid of him. When he caught the Russian guy with the pills. He didn't show any compassion, humanity or understanding, but only the stupid regulations were important. He didn't try to make even one step to find a better solution of the problem. I think that the conclusion is that we should make, is to look more like Navorski , to be honest, real, true friends, to help each other and care a bit more about the others people's feelings, to show some more mercy and compassion. The personal prosperity, success and wealth should not make you selfish and blind. Open your eyes, look around you and think what would it be, if all these people were your friends instead of your rivals or foes."

A great premise for a movie, loosely based on the true story of the immigrant who was stranded at Paris airport due to diplomatic bureaucracy, however Spielberg reduces the whole story to implausible sugary mush.<br/><br/>No doubt the director, famed for his heavy-handed and childlike emotional manipulation, thought he was improving the drama by adding a love interest in the shape of Catherine Zeta-Jones, but no one in their right mind could believe that such an attractive and well-groomed woman would ever fall for the shabby, caricature Russian immigrant as played by Tom Hanks. Such a waste of talent and money.<br/><br/>Spielberg obviously believes that his audience has a mental age of 10, and an exceptionally low IQ, as that is probably the only target group that would enjoy this very silly and soppy romantic drama. Shame on you, Steven Spielberg, for offering adult cinema-goers this sugary pap!<br/><br/>Hanks' performance is no worse and no better than his recent stint in The Ladykillers, i.e. mildly amusing in a cartoonish sort of way. If I were Russian I would be seriously insulted by the bordering-on racist portrayal. Miraculously, Hank's character moved from speaking almost no English to being extremely fluent within a very short period, and gaining a posse of bumbling friends within the airport. The genre should have been listed as fantasy rather than romantic drama. And as for the comedy aspect - I seem to have totally missed it, unless it's deemed funny to laugh at foreigners in a difficult predicament.<br/><br/>With some character development and a decent script, this could have been an interesting film, however it's two leads were sadly wasted in this saccharine turkey."
"yrussell","1","74","154","5 October 2006"," Nothing to do with Merhan Karimi Nasseri
","The tragic story of Iranian Merhan Karimi Nasseri is that he has been living in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris since 1988; due to a complex bureaucratic mess regarding his stolen refugee papers. I was always interested in this story. I knew in advance that this film was loosely based on it, but I also knew that they changed many details to make it more palatable for an American audience (Iranian??? no! France??? no!). Instead, make the main character a simple-minded pseudo-Russian, put it in New York (NEW YORK!! America!!), and instead of a story about a refugee, make it a story about collecting an autograph from a jazz musician.<br/><br/>The whole thing is frivolous and clichéd. Tom Hanks' accent is straight out of a bad sitcom from the 80's. So is the ""ooh ahh, I love America, land of freedom, so much better than Russia"" shtick. Old, tired, rubbish... not to mention the 'romance' between the border official and cargo man. It's called stalking! This movie is just a dumb fairy tale. Probably the best audience are people who've never heard of Merhan Karimi Nasseri, and just want some junk food for the mind. This is it.<br/><br/>In the DVD extras, I was hoping perhaps to see some reference to Mr. Nasseri.... but there isn't a single one. The authors didn't even acknowledge the inspiration. All they did was narcissistically discuss themselves. Boring boring. They built a whole terminal from scratch for this movie? What a waste."

","Painfully bad. A tremendous waste of talent, or perhaps a shocking rebuke of presumed talent. Spielberg should be ashamed. Although based on what could have been a poignant story of a man without a country trapped in an airport by faceless bureaucracy, instead we get a movie with all the character depth of a police academy movie.<br/><br/>One or two inane, illogical scenes might be written off to the ""whimsical"" nature of the movie--but this tripe is riddled with scenes that literally made me cringe. My eyes hurt from rolling them at the awful, cloying attempts at romance. My ears hurt from the insipid, unappealing characters spouting dialog that had all the verisimilitude of an infomercial. And then, there were all the ridiculous, contrived situations followed by more ridiculous, contrived situations. I had heard this movie was mediocre, but I was unprepared for the sheer torture of sitting through it.<br/><br/>Please, don't bother to respond if you found this movie at all enjoyable. If that is true, if you found a shred of value in this train wreck of a film, there is no level at which I could engage you--we have completely different systems of taste, art, values. You obviously exist in some parallel universe, a bizzaro-world where gravity must repel, fish ride bicycles, and really, really bad movies seem good.<br/><br/>For those who live in MY universe, though, I strongly urge you to avoid this movie. Avoid it at all costs."
"filmmaker_nyc","1","37","73","4 January 2005"," A very bad movie from a master filmmaker
","The Terminal is by far the worst Spielberg film so far. Not only the story is ridiculous  based on a true story that has a solid political/legal base  but Tom Hanks' portrait of this Western European man is also his worst work so far. Mr. Hanks - a good actor -being helped by the script and the Director portraits this man like a mentally challenge person, making this film extremely condescending towards Easter European people and foreigns in general. This is not a matter of language barrier or being in another country, is a matter of Mr. Hanks character's IQ. He speaks, moves, acts and reacts like a child or a grown man with a serious mental illness or simply like a stupid person, so the whole movie just doesn't work at all. Another problem is the Director wants us to believe that Mr. Hanks is an Easter European citizen only because he speaks with an accent; they should have made this movie with an unknown good foreign actor. On the other hand, the three characters that work at the airport and play poker to win stole objects are an African American, a Latino and an Indian man. If this is not racism, then what is this? Regarding the plot, it so unbelievable ridiculous that this movie can easy be science fiction. The true story on which this film is based on, it's quite different. It's a Hollywood obsession to change interesting stories to make then more ""American,"" making this last word sounds like more ""stupid."" Just to make things even worst, the only female character in the film is a flight attendant portrayed nicely by Catherine Zeta Jones; but in this film the character is having a relationship with a rich married old man another stereotype for the ""whore"" flight attendant it's just too much. This is just a very bad movie that insults the viewers with condescending remarks over non-US characters and stereotypes."

","I wonder, oh I wonder, despite the intention to present the original true story that happened in France long time ago, how come You Mr. Spielberg have spent so much money on screen-playing this story and you didn't pay attention that this movie will be distributed all around the globe, how come that You didn't pay attention on the non-English languages that are spoken in the movie. You have mixed 1000 languages, For example, Tom hanks is speaking at the guy with the ""pills"" in pure Bulgarian language, mixed with Russian accent, the other guy responds in Russian...total mess....If you want to make movie involving other nationalities, that Mr. Spielberg learn something about them or spent some money on language assistants!!!

"Chapaev36","1","44","89","20 June 2005"," Bigoted Garbage
","Tom Hanks' character in ""The Terminal"" is really supposed to be a rough prototype of the Slavic ""muzhik"" (this becomes clear when Hanks calls mustard ""gorchitsa"", which is Russian for mustard), but it is so misguided and blatantly stereotypical that it becomes offensive. I suppose that Spielberg felt that he would be successful in going for cheap laughs by creating this obscene American representation of a foreigner and I am sure that he did succeed with many people. Spielberg has sunk to a new low with this movie by making fun of a person's accent and his inability to pronounce words like 'cheated' (sounding like 'eat sh*t'). It seems he found an audience willing to consume this dross."

"rphillips-4","1","25","48","1 December 2004"," Over-rated and awful
","There are so many things wrong with this film I don't know where to begin. I'll start by saying that Spielberg and producers should be ashamed of themselves to make this film of such an awful, impractical, predictable, script that should have been presented as a tongue and cheek spoof rather than an overdone, gingerbread light comedy with sappy dramatic moments. The producers of this hackneyed film surely believed that all moviegoers are stupid enough to ignore plot holes the size of Antarctica, buy into situations that are so unrealistic that they are laughable, and be put under a spell by the script's trite gadget formulas that these screenwriters may have picked up at a seminar in Culver City. <br/><br/>The Terminal has a heavy arsenal of anomalies, inconsistencies, and farces, and canards: Chinese tourists waiting a connecting flight to Disneyland in Orlando don't have cameras as they wait to board. So what? They are not in Disneyland yet to take pictures yet. <br/><br/>There is no way any airport authorities would detain a ""nationless"" passenger to the confines of enormous an airport shopping mall where he or she would have the benefit to escape from a gaggle of fire exits in the fast food stations. Where was the B.C.I.S (immigration)? If Stanley Tucci's character was so resolute about having someone else deal with this airport refugee why didn't he just call him or her in the first place? By the end of the movie, Hanks seems to have achieved an enormous amount of revere and power in the airport by his recognition of a photocopy of a hand. Why? Because he tells a Russian transit in cryptic Bulgarian to convince airport authorities that the medicine he is carrying without approval will be used to help cure a goat somewhere in Canada. Need I say more.<br/><br/>There is so much more: Catherine Zeta Jones' consciously neurotic character, who, for some reason, prattles on and on about Napoleon, which by the way, has no connection whatsoever to the story. She confesses to Tom Hanks about her lonesomeness and need for healthy relationship, which she finds in Hanks, however, for some incomplete reason (perhaps she was forced to do another exciting T Mobile commercial) that the producers may of had to quibble over, disappears like thief in the night and returns only for a glimpse as she gets out of a taxi, with a look of contentment on her face that tells us, ""see, I told you that I'm high maintenance"". And...?<br/><br/>In the muddled 3rd Act we finally find out, without any consequential anticipation, what is inside the Planter box? Autographs from Jazz musicians. So what did we learn from this film? Jazz is good, being stuck in an airport is bad, being stuck watching this movie is the worst."
"MovieAddict2016","3","27","53","5 September 2005"," One of the most genuinely annoying films I've seen all year
","I guess it's not fair for me to judge the film. I was a bit biased. I had read about the true story of Merhan Nasseri, an Iranian refugee who landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris in 1988 after being denied entry into England because his passport and United Nations refugee certificate had been stolen. Due to the technicalities he stayed in Terminal 1 and finally, years later, was granted permission to either enter France or return to his own country. The irony is that he has chosen to remain living in the airport.<br/><br/>So, the potential for the film was quite interesting. It's an amazing story and given the right cast I was sure it could be told well. When I heard Spielberg was on board, I was excited, because it implied (to me, anyway) that an experienced director was at the helm who would respect the original story without turning it into some MTV-generation romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Little did I know Spielberg was yet again adding his ""magic touch"" to a true story, and thereby destroying it. This is worse than any MTV movie - it's Spielberg Shlock.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Spielberg's a great director... when someone's got a leash on him. But sometimes he's given too much freedom. His ego tends to get the best of him; he needs to get rid of the yes-men. Something tells me there were a lot of yes-men on the set this time around.<br/><br/>And having Tom Hanks play Viktor was about the worst choice. Hanks' performance is simply awful. Something tells me he had too many yes-men handing him praise, as well.<br/><br/>The plot is very, very, VERY loosely based on the true story of Nasseri, and I'm sure whenever he gets to see the film as it plays on the free TV in Terminal 1, he'll be quite disappointed.<br/><br/>His story was already made into a French film in 1993 named ""Tombés du ciel."" I haven't seen the original but from the plot description on IMDb it sounds far more factually accurate.<br/><br/>Okay, so, you want to know my real problems with the Spielberg remake? Okay, first things first. If you're making a movie about an eastern immigrant, DO NOT name his native country ""Krakhozia."" That's about the WORST fake country name I've ever heard in any movie, and that's including Narnia and Toyland.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie's smug, self-conscious, ""happy"" attitude is awful. It's like a continuation of ""Forrest Gump"" only Hanks is even more annoying.<br/><br/>Thirdly, all the stuff Viktor does in this movie is totally fake and I never for a second bought that he was any eastern immigrant. His accent was terrible and he's stupider than Tara Reid, yet a week after being in the airport he's learned English (with the help of a terminal worker, who, as we all know, have jobs transporting baggage because they're so smart and well-educated). Suddenly Viktor is a well-knowledged, experienced American immigrant who ""knows the ropes"" - he even gets a job as a painter in the terminal.<br/><br/>And then there's the Mandatory Romantic Interest Subplot. It's totally unnecessary and gives the movie a fake, bogged-down feel. Catherine Zeta-Jones is completely annoying (almost as much as Hanks) and her character is a shallow, trite, convenient addition to the plot. Neither character is given much depth and their ""romance"" comes across as being entirely heavy-handed and unbelievable.<br/><br/>On top of the schmaltz and plot contrivances, the continual marketing tie-ins are sickening - I can't say how many times I had Burger King crammed down my throat while watching this movie. After I left, I felt like going to the nearest Burger King and throwing stones at everyone inside. That's how mad it made me. When I pay $16 to see a movie (yes, I paid in pounds, which in dollars is doubled to around $15 or $16) I don't want to have Burger King, Nokia, Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc., thrown into my face. I get enough of that on TV. It was truly embarrassing (and I felt ashamed for Spielberg) when he spends ten minutes following Viktor's adventure to buy a hamburger from Burger King.<br/><br/>The message is nice - if you're an illegal immigrant and can't afford anything, just get jobs no one else wants like cleaning toilets or collecting luggage carts and earn minimum wage so you can buy a greasy hamburger from some pock-marked self-absorbed teenager who probably spat in your food.<br/><br/>I hate to sound really bitter and all (I'm truly not this bitter in real life - usually) but there's something about this movie that just struck me as too nice. It's like Martin Short in the movie ""Clifford"" -- it's so sweet you know there's got to be a hidden agenda somewhere."
"FilmSnobby","1","40","83","7 July 2004"," Gee whiz, it's Spielberg's worst movie yet!
","Although I've never much liked Steven Spielberg's films  (*Jaws*  being the sole exception), I've never confused my dislike with his ability to please a crowd.  The man is undoubtedly a showman . . . I suppose my quarrel is with what he shows us.  Even while despising his sentimentality, I've always grudgingly admired his sheer filmmaking competence.  In other words, I would never give his movies a 1/10 rating.<br/><br/>Until now, until  *The Terminal*.  This is, without equivocation, the worst film of his career.  It has absolutely nothing to recommend it.  They should pay US to see it, really.  First of all, the movie has to set some kind of record for relentless product-placement.  You thought Hanks shilling for FedEx and Wilson Sporting Goods was tacky in  *Castaway*?  Wait till you see him scarf down his seventh Burger King greaseball sandwich in  *The Terminal*.  Wait till you watch him wander aimlessly, over and over, past Sbarro, Starbucks, Hugo Boss Outlets . . . but this is a hint to stop, because I don't want to be the pot calling the kettle black.  Basically, Spielberg & the Gang at Dreamworks came up with the most brilliant ""synergy""  concept yet:  base the story on some nut who was stranded in Charles de Gaulle Intl. Airport in France, make up a bunch of  ""dramatic, funny""  stuff about this character, and bingo! -- you got over 2 hours of CONTINUOUS ADVERTISING.  One retail outlet after another, panning slowly on the big screen.  Hanks can't escape the Terminal, and neither can the targeted audience!  It sometimes helps, when viewing a film, to know the reasons WHY a film gets made:  please remember that DreamWorks is having a bit of financial trouble, lately.  Not a LOT, but some.  The TV shows never materialized; the music-unit was sold off to some other conglomerate; and, worst of all, their movies have been stinking up the box-office for the past couple of years.  In fact, their last major  ""hit""  (if we must call it that)  was  *Gladiator*.<br/><br/>Hence, *The Terminal*  gets dumped on an unsuspecting public.  Make no mistake, kids:  Spielberg did this hack-job with the hopes of covering his own studio's backside.  It is no coincidence that the only element in the film which looks as if any effort was applied is the set of the airport terminal itself.  Indeed, it's an astounding set, the best of its kind ever built, and deserves an Oscar . . . but remember the set's main function:  to hawk Starbucks and the like.  And since this is the movie's main function (with the  ""entertainment""  part hopefully taking care of itself under the auspices of popular showmen like Spielberg and Hanks), it should really come as no surpise that the airport-set is awesome.  There's money to be made, and burgers to be sold.<br/><br/>As for the other aspects of the movie -- you know, the stuff we usually talk about, like the direction, photography, acting, story, and so on -- only the most pedestrian efforts are exerted from the principals  (Spielberg, Hanks, Zeta-Jones).  In the direction category, you would never guess that Spielberg was behind the wheel.  The story has terrible pace, the camera-work is nondescript  (except when panning slowly across yet another advertiser's logo), and the script is devoid of the  ""magical moments""  the director has occasionally pulled off in his other films.  In the acting category, Stanley Tucci tries his damnedest to give an honest performance as the head of security at the terminal, but the script betrays him by making his character, for no clear reason, more villainous as the movie wears on. Tucci's hung out to dry, mouthing dialogue.  As for Hanks and Zeta-Jones: watching them here only made me consider how much I enjoyed them in separate films by the Coen Brothers  (*Intolerable Cruelty*  for Z-J; *The Ladykillers*  for Hanks).  I ended up wishing that I was watching either one of those films again, which, not surprisingly, were directed by artists instead of a huckster."

","Overall I thought the movie was very enjoyable, but I couldn't quite decide which accent Hanks wanted to use. If you listen closely, you can notice that his accent is different from scene to scene and at times it made it difficult to follow what he was saying. I watched the movie on TV, maybe the sound was better at the theater. Did anyone else notice this who saw the movie or was it just my ears playing tricks on me, well I am getting up there in the ages, perhaps it is time for me to think about a hearing aid. I thought the plot was a little lacking, was it a love story or was it about immigration?

","I did not want to watch this movie first - I don't like the claustrophobic movies where the fun has been made of the characters who are awkward foreigners that can not speak English. Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" has got it all but I've came to like it. Technically, it is great - the work of Spielberg's set decorators' and cinematographer's is superb. After a few obligatory jokes based on the main character's total puzzlement and confusion regarding what is happening to him, film starts to look at that man closer and finds a lot in him to admire. The most important for me was the part when we finally find out why Victor Navarsky (Tom Hanks), the citizen of the fictitious Eastern European Country Krakozia came to New York City, NY, USA. The story behind his arrival is simple, sweet, and touching.<br/><br/>I did not like Catherine Zeta Jones in the movie - her strength and her weakness are the same - she cannot forget how beautiful and sexy she looks on the screen. Sometimes, it works perfectly (""The Mask of Zorro"", ""Chicago"", and ""Intolerable Cruelty""). Sometimes, like in this movie, it does not work at all. Another detail - I don't think that making the villain of huge proportions of Stanley Tucci's character was such a great idea. It is not exactly clear why he is determined to make Victor's life even more confusing and miserable with the tenacity deserving better purpose. It was not exactly necessary to make a hero and saint of Hanks' character, either. <br/><br/>With all the negatives, ""The Terminal"" for me is an enjoyable and uplifting fantasy - sentimental, of course and not perfect but fine and touching."

"film-critic","Null","10","17","29 November 2004"," One man, two women; crowded.
","What was the reason for Spielberg to make this film? Was it to showcase how well he works with Tom Hanks? Or was it because he wanted to force audiences into a theater (or Video Store) to pay to watch him sell out and build a very forced film? I would have to go with a combination of the two.<br/><br/>Now, I will say that Spielberg's eye is one of the best in the industry. He continually raises the bar for each film that he makes (see Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan), but for some odd reason with The Terminal it feels like he didn't even have a bar he was trying to reach. The forced feeling of everything that happens around Tom Hanks from the unlit flame of Catherine Zeta-Jones, to a fallible in-flight wedding, to even the corny climax when a character decides to play chicken with the plane, it doesn't seem to work. Even Hanks' accent is poor. It felt as if I was watching Spielberg's table scraps from other films fall down on the floor and get gobbled up by the projector. This film just didn't work. There was not one scene in this film that I can say I enjoyed. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Hanks was Hanks. What more can we expect from him. I do not believe he did anything above and beyond his normal call of duty in this film. I never felt like I saw Viktor in Hanks. All I could see was Hanks with a terrible accent. Whether learned or created, the words that came out of Hanks' mouth seemed like rubbish. It felt more like audience-cute instead of a definite control of the words. Perhaps it was just me, but it felt as if Hanks learned English exceptionally fast. Strange, but this was a huge plot-hole that Spielberg left wide open for us to fall into. Outside of Hanks (being Hanks), there was Zeta-Jones who chose to go with the 'bimbo' slant with her character. She seemed ditzy, dull, and completely unfocused in this film. Her chemistry with Tom Hanks seemed completely plastic and created. There was nothing between them that said to me that they were a match made in heaven. While others will argue that Spielberg had them in the film to show two sides of living in an airport (the literal and the figurative), I thought that it was a cheap shot to guide in female viewers. What a better way to do so than with a forced romance. It makes me laugh just typing about it. Second, was Tucci even a villain? Along the same lines as my Zeta-Jones comment, there was not enough character or structure for me to even believe Tucci as a bad airport director. One moment he is asking Viktor for help and another time is yelling at him. These two characters had about as much consistency as oatmeal. Oddly, this was the general feeling of this film.<br/><br/>Outside of the characters, the major flaw in this film is the story. By the second hour of the film we have lost all hope in our characters and fearless director that we don't care what happens to anyone. Viktor's dramatic conclusion is overshadowed by the two hours of garbage that had been slowly piling up. I couldn't get excited or care what was going to happen next in this film, and that is a sign that something is doomed. I continued to get a sense of claustrophobia, wondering if Spielberg would finally take Hanks out of the airport and build upon something new and fresh. Alas, that never happened. Instead, we are forced to repeat the same steps over and over again in a way that almost makes you nauseated. Did Spielberg have a goal or vision with this film, or was it just made up along the way? Also, was his editor on vacation? I realize that his epics are normally long, but this one just seemed to drag beyond belief. I needed something, actually anything to keep my attention in this film, and yet nothing arrived. It felt like opening that Christmas present that you think is what you really want, but instead it is just socks. Boy, don't you feel let down?<br/><br/>Overall, I was highly disappointed with this film. When I see a Spielberg film I expect to be blown away by sharp images, infallible characters, and a compassionate story. He has built so much notoriety on his name and style of film alone that there is a certain expectation when going to see one of his films. I do not feel it is bad to request these three elements in his pictures. Sadly, in The Terminal I saw nothing of the sort. It was as if Spielberg was attempting to just create a big cliché instead of a film. It was as if he was doing the complete opposite from what he normally does. In this film he had shoddy images, underdeveloped and lost characters, and a repetitive repulsive story. I do not recommend this film for anyone that is a fan of Spielberg's work. It will only bring a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>Grade: ** out of *****"
"zkonedog","7","5","7","27 February 2017"," Great Idea + Great Hanks = Entertaining Film
","Sometimes, a movie only needs a great idea and a great actor to be really, really good. ""The Terminal"" is an example of that kind of film making. There are a number of things that prevent ""The Terminal"" from being an all-time classic, but the performance from Tom Hanks and the ""guy trapped in an airport"" premise is enough to make for a very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Viktor Novorski (Hanks), who is trying to get from his home country of Krakosau into the United States (New York City, to be exact). On the international trip, however, Krakosau is over-run by rebels and no longer recognized by the U.S. government. As a result, Novorski cannot return home, nor can he legally enter America. He is ""trapped"" in the airport terminal, waiting for something to happen. Not helping matters is that airport director Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) has it out for Viktor. While patiently waiting for a resolution to his situation, Viktor meets a number of friends, including a potential romantic interest (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman he greets every day trying to get his status validated (Zoe Saldana), and a number of other airport workers who help him be as comfortable as possible in such a strange situation.<br/><br/>""The Terminal"" is a charming movie mainly because you'll probably never watch a film quite like it. Under the able direction of Steven Spielberg, the movie succeeds in taking a ludicrous situation and making you care about a majority of the proceedings. Of course, it helps to have Hanks in the drivers seat of the leading role, as he turns in yet another performance that will make you think ""this can can play anything!"". Without his presence, this would be a forgettable experience.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""The Terminal"" is completely and utterly unable to capture any romantic chemistry between the Hanks & Zeta-Jones characters. For whatever reason (likely because Zeta-Jones just simply isn't around enough), the emotional backbone of the movie fizzles. For me, this was enough to drop the experience an entire star rating. Had the romance angle been done better, it would have easily been five stars. As it was, there were just too many moments towards the end of the film where I was thinking ""I know I SHOULD be wrapped up in these emotions more, but..."" instead of just enjoying the experience.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""The Terminal"" is a quirky, entertaining little flick that really emphasizes the ""less is more"" philosophy of making a solid cinematic experience. In this case, all it took was a great idea and a great actor. With those components given to Mr. Spielberg, he was able to work his magic (sans a believable romance) with the rest."
"TheLittleSongbird","5","9","15","31 January 2017"," Wildly uneven film that starts off well but peters out too early
","Not a terrible film by all means, but one where it is easy to see why it would polarise viewers (as evident in the user reviews here) and why there are those considering it a lesser Steven Spielberg film.<br/><br/>'The Terminal' is not Spielberg's worst film, to me 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', '1941' and 'War of the Worlds' (which had a very good first half and completely fell apart halfway through and never recovered) are worse. Ranking it in his filmography, it is nowhere near close to being one of his best and while not rock-bottom to me it is lesser Spielberg.<br/><br/>Starting with 'The Terminal's' merits, the production values are top-notch and Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is once again beautiful and a major plus. While not some of his best work, John Williams' score is pleasantly understated and slick without over-emphasising the mood.<br/><br/>Of the performances, which mostly are good, Tom Hanks makes a valiant effort in the title role and does an excellent job on the most part and Stanley Tucci clearly enjoys himself as Dixon. Hanks and Tucci's chemistry is where 'The Terminal' is particularly strong. The supporting cast are good, and Kumar Pallana is quite a scene-stealer (though the wet floor stuff does get over-used and repetitive).<br/><br/>'The Terminal' starts off well. The story is intriguing, there is a razor sharp satirical edge to some of the comedy and there is an affecting whimsy.<br/><br/>However, 'The Terminal' is hurt by the second half being nowhere near as interesting and Spielberg himself (regardless of his technical mastery) playing it too safe with a subject matter that should have been executed in the film more sharply and harshly. There is too much emphasis on the airport-terminal-as-microcosm-of-society angle and it just doesn't work because of how tentatively and safely the subject is approached.<br/><br/>Credibility rapidly decreases and gets increasingly strained and too often replaced by the sentimentality going into saccharine overload. Really could have done without the romantic subplot, that was not necessary, felt like thrown in padding and was completely underdeveloped and featured far too much. The lack of chemistry between Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones doesn't help, nor does despite her beauty Zeta Jones being so bland in a role that gives her practically nothing to do. The characters are also far too neatly black and white with stereotypes that won't bode, and actually hasn't boded, well with some.<br/><br/>Overall, wildly uneven that had potential to be good but doesn't ever fully convince. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Good-Evening-Clarice","1","9","15","12 June 2004"," AWFUL!
","I can't believe Hanks, Spielberg and Zeta-Jones teaming together would result in such a horrible film. I know they were going for a light and funny feel, but they got light and empty-headed instead. Forget the Oscars, this does not even qualify for mindless summer fun. Completely unbelievable, with Hanks' accent so terrible it was the only comic relief throughout a very flimsy plot. Basically, the concept is not all that intriguing but if played for comedy it's even worse. A big let-down. I don't know if this will be a big hit, but I bet it won't. I never believed in any of the characters; none felt authentic. And why would you make Catherine look frumpy in a movie? Grade: C-."

I agree with you people that her character was irrelevant in the movie.<br/><br/>Spielberg should had made the ending more happy. If he did use the cliché, boy gets girl in the end then it would have completed the whole picture. I really wanted to see Viktor win Amelia's heart in the end and he could of. The bit towards the end where Viktor was celebrating the end of the war in country, Amelia came to give him a Visa to go to New York. She said she was going and Viktor did not try to express how he felt about her. Didn't the mural he made from the bathroom toilet mean anything to her? If she knows that he is different from other men, (because he listens) then why doesn't she come back to him, instead she goes back to that guy with the wife. Does she not realise that she is making the stupid mistake that she is trying to avoid the whole movie? If she had no influence on Viktor then why put her in the movie. People even if they know that there is a happy ending will still watch it because its what they want to see.<br/><br/>Now every time I watch the movie, I get really sad towards the end because the do not stay with each other in the end because the build up to their romance was so compelling and with twist ending it really stuffed up the movie for me.<br/><br/>What do you think? P.S (Who was Amelia waiting for 18 years, couldn't quite catch that in the movie.)"
"GirishGowda","8","7","11","20 May 2010"," Really Funny and Moving
","I didn't know that this movie was directed by Steven Spielberg until the final credits came on screen. Though this movie has come so many times on TV, I only watched it today. I wasn't interested in it all that much before. This is a really funny and moving film.<br/><br/>Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from Krakozhia enters into the US JFK terminal. Before leaving for New York, there comes a news that there is war going on internally in his country. So, now he is a citizen of nowhere and has to stay at the airport till there is peace in his own country. In the terminal, he struggles for food, place to sleep and meets good people and falls for Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is an air hostess. But Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) does everything he can to get Viktor out of his airport and hand him over to the authorities. He makes close friends in Gupta Rajan, a sweeper, and Enrique Cruz and another man. Why does he want to go to the Big Apple so badly? And will his romance with Amelia have an happy ending? And will he take the bait of Frank Dixon? <br/><br/>The shot in the beginning where the camera zooms from Viktor's face to show us the entire lounging area is so heart-breaking. Even though he's surrounded by people, he is all alone. Directed by the visual effects master Steven Spielberg, this is quite different from the other films he has directed (atleast the ones I have seen). He addresses the discrimination that some outsiders face in the US. Viktor is very funny in his childlike innocence. Sometimes he reminded me of Mr. Bean. Tom Hanks portrayed Viktor wonderfully. Stanley Tucci is a great actor and he does justice to his role. In the ending scene, you can actually see that he is happy for Viktor. This is the man who did everything to make Viktor's life at the airport miserable. Though nobody will keep an outsider for 9 months in a terminal, it was a good fantasy film. Catherine Zeta-Jones, God this woman doesn't look a day over 25 years; she is so beautiful. She conveyed everything that her character felt through her eyes and tears. I was pretty moved by this film. One can't, but root for Viktor and hope against hope that he gets what he wants. Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana) is a security authority at the airport and she also has a sweet love story. I recently became her fan after Star Trek and Avatar. She is extremely talented and beautiful. All I can say, this film will not bore for you even for one second and it is very entertaining.<br/><br/>8/10"

","In a word, crap. But as they say in the business, the show must go on, and that is what they did. Any movie with such inaccuracies as I will outline should never be able to hit the shelves. Lets see, the first we ever see of our main character we notice that he speaks no English, and when told to go out into the international area, rejected without any access to an lawyer, let alone anyone who speaks his language(which any moron would recognize as at the very least eastern European). I mean come on, first 5 minutes of the movie he has become a non-person who lives in an airport. Now I know it is fiction but come on, even illegal aliens have a right to legal advice when entering the US. not wanting to give away much more of the ever worsening story, why the hell is there a love story? what does his crush have to do with anything in the story what so ever, nothing, it advances the plot none, and just acts as a pain extender to lengthen the movie to make it at least worth the film it was projected from. All in all, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this movie, and although I usually enjoy Tom Hanks, WHY WOULD HE DERADE HIMSELF TO THIS FILTH!!!! Probably the best part of the movie is that parts of it were filmed in Mirabel Airport, miles away from doing harm to anyone"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","15","29","26 September 2004"," VN go home (or, welcome back Steven Spielberg)
","Spoilers<br/><br/>The Terminal brings back the good old Spielberg from the ET days. We see again his childlike playfulness  I mean who else can get as much fun out of a surveillance camera? We get a generous dose of the simple warmth of the 'little people' ('not pygmies and dwarfs', as Bob Hope said in the 1971 Academy Award show that he hosted) - I mean it reaffirms to those of us who have this experience that our best friends in life are the other three regular 'hands' at the card table. <br/><br/>Some critics in town are way overboard in denouncing TT as American propaganda. While there are unquestionably Hollywood movies aplenty waving the big-good-Americans-helping-the-rest-of-the-world flag (e.g. Tears of the Sun), one of them TT certainly is NOT. To be aroused in anti-American sentiments just from hearing 'The United States' or 'New York' is getting a bit close to paranoia. What Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) wants is to go to a certain jazz artist, and the fact that this means going into the U.S. and New York City is purely incidental, in the context of things. Replace that with Paris, France, the script works just as well. As a matter of fact, the true events by which the story is inspired did happen in Paris, France.<br/><br/>Rather, TT is about perseverance, survival, friendship and commitment. No preaching by Spielberg, who just let the ideas tickle you gently. The romance is just a little overdone, I agree.<br/><br/>This has become almost too predictable but once again, Tom Hanks is a big reason, if not the biggest reason, for watching a movie. Katherine Zeta-Jones playing Amelia Warren has completely recovered her look, shape, and girlish charm in the Zorro/Entrapment days, and that is another reason. Stanley Tucci keeps reminding me that I'm watching Stanley Tucci and that's a good thing, making the villain Frank Dixon at least a little lovable. Even stereotyping in the hands of a good director becomes a plus, as borne out by the cast of minority roles in this picture.<br/><br/>There's no point getting too serious about TT. For example, challenging that one just can't learn English by putting two travel guides (one in English and one in mother tongue) side by side is just about as meaningful as challenging that 5 cakes and 2 fishes can't possibly feed 5,000 people. What I like, on the other hand, is little things such as Spielberg's self-referencing when Viktor Navorski intimates that he is afraid of sharks. At the end of the day, all I know is I haven't laughed so much and so heartily in a movie for quite a while."

","Viktor Navorski is a citizen of a fictional Eastern European country who is making his way through New York's JFK when news breaks of a coup in his homeland and more importantly for him the cancellation of all of the countries passports. This leaves Victor in a strange limbo; he can't now enter the United States nor can he be sent home as it is too dangerous. He is left to live in the international departure terminal; a situation at frustrates Frank Dixon, the man in charge of the terminal. Frank would prefer it if Victor just left; then he would be somebody else's problem. As time passes Victor doesn't just survive in the terminal; he thrives. He makes friends with some of the workers, learns English and even gets a well-paid construction job after finishing a job that had been left overnight. He also befriends Amelia, a stewardess who passes through the airport every couple of weeks, and the possibility of romance arises.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film that captures what it would be like to arrive in a country only to discover that your homeland was in turmoil and you were now stateless then this really isn't it; that is just an excuse to force our protagonist to live in the airport this is very much a comedy not gritty realism. The comedy is gentle and pretty funny; this is of course helped by Tom Hank's performance as Victor; he does a great job making his situation believable and his character likable rather than irritating. He is ably supported by Stanley Tucci as Dixon and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Amelia; I liked the fact that certain expected clichés in the relationship between her and Victor were avoided. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too. While this isn't one of Hanks' or Spielberg's best known film it is a lot of fun and well worth watching if you are looking for a gentle film with some good laughs and characters you can care about."

","Unlike good friend George Lucas who's spent a grand portion of the last two decades fixated on creating more interpretations for pointless ""Star Wars"" incarnates like if there was no tomorrow, cohort Steven Spielberg has arbitrarily took different avenues in the film industry to exhibit his versatility as a director and in ""The Terminal"" he shows just how dynamic he is as a director and after almost 45 years in the film industry, he still manages to come up with a wide range of topics and enlightens us that there is a world out there besides ""Star Wars"". <br/><br/>Just like his previous outing before ""The Terminal"", ""Catch Me If You Can"", the subject matter has a humble idea brewing along, but the subtlety by Spielberg along with the likable characters make this one like ""Catch Me If You Can"" an enlightening character study that will leave you glued to your seat. ""The Terminal"" could very much be a comeback to Spielberg's early roots when he used to direct more artsy like films, or he may just be doing light, stylish pictures so that he can prepare himself for his next big-budgeted film ""War of the Worlds"". But for what this movie stands out, we'll just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who has been a favorite performer of Spielberg's stars as Eastern European born Viktor Navorski who came from the fictitious country of Krakoshia and arrives at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City. When he arrives in America he receives the news that his country is embarked in a bloody war and is unsafe to return there. With the government there being overthrown, his country is now just as good as being obsolete which makes Navorski's passport next to nothing. In others he can't go home because he has no home left plus he can't enter America because he has to go through a lot of hurdles to get through. In simpler terms this man has no place to call home to. <br/><br/>Viktor's first hurdle he must conflict with is a Homeland Security Officer named Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who tries to simplify things to our uni-lingual immigrant that in our enter the country, he must have tons of paperwork he must undertake and must be completed. <br/><br/>Days have gone by and Krakoshia has not let up and a homeless Viktor has now taken residence at Gate 67, Frank now has dilemma right under his nose. Frank feels the only solution would be is to get himself off the hook and let someone else take the Viktor situation off his hands. He gives Viktor approval to leave the area in praying he'll be incarcerated by the immigration officials. Being raised in Communist born country Viktor is oblivious to the government policies and to just patiently remain at JFK airport. This leads to the expected friction between the uptight Frank and the wedge that Viktor has made himself to be towards Frank. <br/><br/>With Frank determined to make Viktor's stay more laborious than one deserves, Viktor progressively befriends several employees at the airport which includes the introverted food service worker named Enrique (Diego Luna) who'll offer Viktor food if he can get more info on a fellow employee he's secretly smitten with named Dolores (Zoe Saldana). His other friends include a cargo handler named Joe (Chi McBride) and a custodial worker named Gupta (Kumar Pallana). Viktor eventually gets a job and gets romantically linked to a flight attendant named Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The characters depicted here is where the comedy factor is featured and at times it feels at most improvised by the cast which speaks volumes knowing the Spielberg is behind the camera. <br/><br/>Hanks does a wonderful job here and captures a sense of likability like one of his most enduring characters in the 1990's namely Forrest Gump. Zeta-Jones has a very limited role here, but she excels well here as love-confused character in a vulnerable position. Normally I cringe when Stanley Tucci ends up playing hateful characters because of his reputation of overacting them. Sure his villainy here is portrayed clichéd, but here he's playing it more subtle and that's refreshing coming from Tucci. Granted Spielberg can overthrow us with overly done schmaltz, but here the schmaltz was limited here and that makes the film all the more enthralling. The characters are low-key but developed enough to get to know them and his light direction doesn't give us any indication that this movie is directed by a legend in his craft. <br/><br/>The script was done by ""The Truman Show"" writer Andrew Niccol as he succeeds in keeping the script tight with no heavy-handed stuff to catch you off guard while he succeeds in keeping it unconventional. The final scenes feature little surprises that will shock you in some way to the point of refraining from any kind of contrived Hollywood formula. <br/><br/>Overall, ""The Terminal"" succeeds in being more truthful in showing how developed countries like the United States reacts towards foreigners who want to start a life in this country. The film fends itself nice through the characters and the interactions between them. Its a film that charmingly demonstrates paranoia, insecurity, xenophobia that manifests within the diversity of the American people. This movie can show a sweet side to a rather serious subject without feeling cheated."

The main story is of the man (Viktor Navorski) stranded at airport, who wins everybody's hearts. There's a story of an Indian man, who has been long working on airport, since murdering police official in India who thinks of Viktor as an agent. There's a story of a troubled couple, the women from which loves to read, for whom Viktor falls. There's another story of two young person's falling in love and getting married, all with help of Viktor.

Winning hearts of officials, finding way to gain money are others.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Viktor who is there to fulfill his sentiments related to his Father. The movie is what I call lovely. In the end the purpose of Navorski is fulfilled. The best part about the movie I liked was the napoleon story that women conveys to Viktor and drug incident. The only disappointing part in the movie was Viktor not getting to have the women even after showing his exceptional skills, especially in constructing a beautiful architecture.

The entire story takes place in JFK airport (which I understand is actually a set) surrounding Eastern European traveller Viktor Navorski. Just as Viktor arrives in New York his country enters into a civil war and his visa is cancelled leaving him stranded in the airport. With limited English Victor manages to survive what becomes months in the arrivals lounge.

Personally I would have liked a bit more background on his life before JFK but for whatever reason his character is left vague and never fully developed. What really makes this movie though is not so much Hanks or Viktor but all the people he meets and becomes involved with while in the airport.<br/><br/>The secondary characters here are fantastic; Stanley Tucci as the airport boss and bad guy -love to hate him, the baggage handlers (Chi McBride) & (Diego Luna) and (Zoë Saldana) as an immigration official. And wow did I ever fall in love with grumpy, paranoid, wet floor watching, plate spinning janitor Gupta Raja (Kumar Pallana), he stole every scene he was in.<br/><br/>Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the love interest, she's a flight attendant who Narvorski tries to have a thing with but she's all tied up with a married man.

Viktor having no job at T1, having lost his food coupons decides to cut through his problems by not looking at the negative side, but the positive way. He works at the Terminal, eats there and sleeps there. He turns an uninhabited gate to his house. He finds innovative ways to earn – picking up loose trolleys, promoting shopping and carpentry. Finally he wins the hearts of everyone at the terminal and makes his dad's dream come true – stepping into NYC and getting the autograph from Benny Golson.<br/><br/>The film teaches us many things. Love, Friendship, Sacrifice, Patience, Problem Solving and Elasticity – are some of them. Released on June 18th 2004, the film runs for 128 minutes. Editing and Cinematography is crisp – and the art director amazes us with rebuilding a real life set of the Terminal.<br/><br/>Verdict – Make a trip to this 'Terminal'. You'll never regret!"

","Tom Hanks is on his usual affeable form, but Spielberg turns up the schmaltz just a little too much, as is his want. <br/><br/>A glut of contrived side stories adds more fat than the lean frame can handle. Some unconvincing romantic asides just distract from the core of Hanks' resourcefulness, in an odd mirror image of Castaway's self sufficiency theme. At over two hours in length, this sweet and charming tale outstays its welcome. <br/><br/>However the endeavour is saved by an impeccably mannered performance from Stanley Tucci who adds depth and intrigue by way of his confounded terminal manager."

","I simply can not believe that this movie was even made much less that it got such a high rating from the other reviewers on this website.

There is nothing even remotely original about the plot; the characters are not in the least bit sympathetic and just about any one with a bit of movie savvy can tell how this film is going to end. I don't mind silly plots if the movie entertains me but just about everything about this film turned me off.

I never would have guessed with his instincts he would produce such a frustratingly ham-fisted clichéd film. Being beat over the head with the pretext of the film is not my idea of entertainment. The immigration authorities finally figure out after way too long that the gentleman played by Tom Hanks doesn't understand English. Yet they continue to lecture him in English about immigration law. Huh? I don't get it. The film continues along the same vein. There isn't a sole in the airport that can see he needs some help and doesn't speak the language. Not realistic and plain dumb.

"wcavuca","8","13","26","12 September 2004"," May be not the best Spielberg, but indeed a ""must-see"" movie!
","As I realized after reading some comments posted at IMDb, some people, and sadly, mostly the Americans, seem not to catch the subliminal message in this movie. Spielberg, as he tried in ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"", focus the plot on the way Americans deal with aliens, be them extra-terrestrial or humans. In Brazil, in a coincidence, ""The Terminal"" opened on the eve of September 11, in which we all remembered the terrible day for humanity in 2001, which triggered the return to the once well known paranoia with aliens that the Americans used to have (since Pearl Harbor?), what the same Spielberg tried to ""exorcize"" in the mentioned ""E.T."". Such paranoia has been insistently and extensively used by the current U.S. President to enhance American patriotism, at the expenses, in most cases, in similar or different circumstances, of people like the ""Krakhozian"" Viktor Navorski, a reference for all aliens that daily have  for ""business"" or ""pleasure""  to cross the gates of Immigration Offices in American airports. I wished the American ""silent majority"" that seems to support the current U.S. President - in his current efforts for a second term - could watch this movie and try to understand the beautiful humane message that Spielberg, with the support of a fantastic cast (Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci are superb!) tried to transmit to all of us. Anyone who ever crossed - as an alien - the gates of Immigration Offices in the U.S. will catch immediately such message and be tremendously sympathetic to the poor Navorski I wouldn't say that this is the best of Spielberg. But  do doubts!  with such most contemporary message, this is a ""must see"" movie!"

This is a dreadful illusion - Spielberg purporting to speak for an imagined America, as he likes to do, wishing that it has, after all, a heart of gold. Naturally the film flopped around the globe and in the homeland; Hollywood liberal schmaltz at its worst. And such a dreadful visual style: overblown yet superficial at the same time. Thankfully it's already all but forgotten. Give me a slice of real America, please."
"tieman64","Null","7","12","7 October 2007"," Spielberg's spatial experiment, yet another failure
","Having made enough money off his escapist films, Spielberg set out in the early 80s to be thought of as a serious film-maker. One who innovates or invents some new form of narrative progression.<br/><br/>The irony, of course, is that whenever Spielberg sets out to ""seriously"" and self-consciously experiment with cinematic form, he makes total crap, whilst whenever he sets out to make a simple escapist film, he often revolutionises film in some way. (if you consider sustained sadism, CGI and blockbuster mechanics beneficial, let alone truly revolutionary.) <br/><br/>""The Terminal"", despite its simple premise, is a very experimental film. Here Spielberg is playing with the notion of cinematic space. Film as an environment and environment as central character.<br/><br/>All ""serious"" film-makers have at least one purely architectural film. Welles has ""The Trial"", Kubrick has ""The Shining"", Polanski has ""The Tenant"", Lumet has ""12 Angry Men"", Hitchcock has ""Rear Window"", Fincher has ""Panic Room"" (failure), Altman has ""Gosford Park"" (amongst many others), Cameron has ""Titanic"", Scorsese has ""Gangs of New York"", Curtiz has ""Casablanca"", De Palma has ""Snake Eyes"" etc etc.<br/><br/>Now Spielberg and Scorsese have been evolving along the same lines since the 80s, and so when Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" hit the screens, Spielberg thought it high time to make a spatial movie of his own.<br/><br/>But what type of spatial movie? Should he go the Hitchcock route? Should he go the Welles route? Should he go the Altman route? No, he goes the Kubrick route (probably because he's a big fan of ""The Shining"") and decides to invest allegorical meaning into his environmental space. And so instead of ""Hotel as model of America"" (The Shining) we have ""Airport as model of the world"" (The Terminal).<br/><br/>Thus, Spielberg inserts little symbolic episodes, the notion of getting real and false images (photographs, signatures and passports), symbolic quests for love and identity, and tries to weave various fable like strands into the whole thing. But it doesn't work at all because these things are all above Spielberg's head. He has no gift for filming dialogue, let alone complex allegories.<br/><br/>Spielberg is a serious student of cinema and he's aware of these various cinematic notions because he's seen countless masters do them. His problem is that he's trying to repeat past experiments instead of conducting those of his own. <br/><br/>Look, for example, at the difference between ""ET"" and ""Empire of the Sun"". ""ET"" is about an alien separated from his parents and ""Empire"" is about a boy separated from his parents. One is an artistically honest film (despite being about aliens!), the other is a self-conscious and failed attempt at semiotics. ""Empire"" is about an unreliable narrator (Bale) and the merging of false memories and fantasies, ""ET"" is about an artist (Spielberg) putting his true fantasies and feelings on screen. One is Lynch territory, the other Truffaut.<br/><br/>""Honest Spielberg"" has a natural gift for ""ET"", whilst ""serious Spielberg"" has only a basic, distant understanding of ""Empire"". These polarised Spielberg identities are present in ""The Terminal"". On one hand it wants to be a serious allegory, on the other, it's just a cutesy feel-good comedy, a big budget rip off of ""Moscow on the Hudson"", Herzog's ""Stroszek"" and a couple works by Tati.<br/><br/>The main reason for these problems is that Spielberg works too fast. You can't imbue something with meaning and thought if you don't honestly put thought into it. The result will always be lightweight.<br/><br/>But ignoring allegory, ""The Terminal"" fails on a literal level as well. Its comedy is juvenile and at times cringe-worthy, and the romance between Tom Hanks and Zeta Jones is handled ineptly. But again, that's nothing new. Spielberg has always handled sexuality with a very strong sense of awkwardness. For example, the laughable sex scenes in ""Munich"", Matt Damon's ""boob recollection"" at the end of ""Saving Private Ryan"", the lesbians in ""Color Purple"", the romance in ""Always"" or the ""sex scene"" in the aircraft's cockpit in ""1941"". The romantic scenes and ""F-bomb jokes"" in ""Catch Me If You Can"" are likewise particularly awkward.<br/><br/>But most of all, ""The Terminal"" is a giant waste of money. Constructing such a beautiful set and then failing to use it properly is very offensive. But then, has Spielberg ever conveyed a tangible sense of true 3d space? Think of ""AI"" with its obvious sound-stages, or ""Minority Report"", where strong rays of white light are used to block off the sets. Do that film's ""car factory"" and ""jet pack"" action sequences take place in Spielberg's future city or do they feel like self contained sets, with no bridges or linkages between them? Oddly, despite being a master of camera movement, these is never the sense of any spatial world in Spielberg's films. Instead his locations are all cut off, a series of disconnected set pieces rather than tangible environmental spaces. His films rely on the power of the edit, of the cut, to force his imagery.<br/><br/>And yet with ""The Terminal"" Spielberg has a vast set at his disposal and nevertheless fails to charter space with any sense of intelligence. Can you imagine what Altman, De Palma or Welles would do with a set like this?<br/><br/>6/10 - Too long, not funny and lacks allegorical meat. There are a few good jokes at the beginning, all involving Tom Hanks' lack of understanding the English language, but ultimately Spielberg has just infantilized Hanks and treated him as yet another Spielbergian lost boy. Why not just re-watch ""Moscow on the Hudson"", Herzog's ""Stroszek"" or anything by Jacques Tati? Why is Spielberg continually trying to convince us he's the new Capra, the new Tati, when in reality he's more of a gleeful sadist along the lines of Peckinpah?"

"jessejace","7","11","22","24 December 2004"," not what i expected, but then again, what is?
","Spielberg has made so many ""oh my god that was so powerful and believable and IMPORTANT"" movies, that now he can't make a whimsical bit of fluff without people saying, ""Oh my god, that was so unpowerful and inconceivable and TRIVIAL."" This movie feels like Catch Me If You Can, and requires a similar amount of suspension of disbelief in order to be enjoyed. Tom Hanks plays a foreign guy who learns to speak English in record time by reading a travel pamphlet. He falls for Catherine Zeta Jones, who is still beautiful as ever, even when playing a stupid, despicable flight attendant.<br/><br/>But watch out for the ""evil"" airport director! I say airport director, but he should have been referred to throughout the movie as the ""final boss,"" because he seemed more like King Koopa or Sephiroth than a person existing in real life. How do you seriously explain his petty vengeance against Tom Hanks' character? That was the main issue that stuck with me throughout the film. The Evil Airport Director's role as fascist overlord of JFK Airport just didn't jive.<br/><br/>There is also an important plot point near the end that made no sense to me whatsoever. It involves the final trumping of the Evil Overlord via an Indian janitor whose catchphrase, ""DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?"" failed to make the Japanese audience at the theater where I watched Terminal laugh even once. I won't give it away, just watch the movie and then send me an email explaining what the hell happened, because I don't get it.<br/><br/>This is not an important movie. It has no massive revelations or cathartic outpourings of wisdom (although it comes close, in a scene where Evil Final Boss asks Tom Hanks why he wants to enter the US. I half expected Tom to slap himself on the forehead and say, ""You're right! Why indeed!"" and get on a plane to some country where foreigners DON'T get treated like garbage). But I won't rush to condemn Spielberg for taking a lighthearted prance down Fluffy Fluff Lane for the sake of box office numbers. Spielberg is only human, and he needs his five houses and twelve cars, just like the rest of us."

Tom Hanks gives a incredible performance with his European accent, and in general, there are many lovable characters in this movie. The story is well crafted with many humor, and it explores the theme of ""waiting"" really well. The score by John Williams is really heartwarming, and it has all the things that make a movie good.

And I thought on his good movies, ones that made him King: ""Jaws"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Close Encounters"" ""A.I"" and so on. And I've realized how he directs better on atmosphere and terrain, not specifically on characters. How would you explain such a flat, unengaging relationship on screen between Hanks and Zeta Jones, dipped into an absurd, contrived relation? And the fact that we buy those thin characters as profoundly painted or widely written? That there is a suspension of belief on them letting Hanks in the Terminal, on the demeanor on Stanley Tucci's behavior? Im not gonna say it is a nice picture on bureaucracy edges.<br/><br/>Nowadays, the world is filled with forms and papers, with rules and legislations, and making a story like these (besides it is based on facts) is not original but interesting. ""The Terminal"" is an experiment on people that are ""stuck"" in a place, on their limited environment.

","THE TERMINAL (2004) ***1/2 Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride, Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, Kumar Pallana. Hanks delivers another patented wonderful acting turn as Viktor Navorski a foreigner in a unique situation: en route from his (fictitious) homeland Krakozia to New York he is found in a unique situation when his country is suddenly turned upside down in a civil war out break that leaves him stranded at John F. Kennedy International Airport where he cannot go back nor venture further until either the conflict stops or his nation is recognized by the good ol' USA. Stranger in a strange land trappings aside and with a convincing vaguely Slavic cum Greek accent Hanks' affable comic side gets a full work out mixing into social commentary via political underpinnings cum slapstick screwball romantic comedy (Zeta-Jones as a comely stewardess he encounters during his endless stay in limbo) and his arch nemesis in the prickly form of Tucci an airport bureaucrat from hell. Wes Anderson stock character actor Pallana steals the show as a grumpy janitor. The screenplay by Andrew Niccol, Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson has a Sturges like quality with some playful comedy and sentimentality smartly interplayed with the nimble stylings of Hanks as he tries to make do with silent screen homage to the likes of Chaplin and Keaton expertly staged by master filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Kudos to Alex McDowell's production design of building an actual replica of the famous airport as an entity unto itself.

He can't possibly give him the fish it's way too obvious. He gives him the fish. Aaaaargh). Weak story (what's Dixon's beef anyway? What do you know - he's got dirt on all Victor's friends just so he can force him to go home on the next flight). Never Ending (I would rather have been waiting in an airport terminal for 9 months). Gushily sentimental (""So where you wanna go buddy?"", ""I am going home""). Plot 'twists' for their own sake. It's all of these yet somehow as a whole the sum is more lame than all it's parts. I would rather have watched ""the Wilderness Family"". The only saving grace was Kumar Pallana's juggling. Otherwise torturously awful."

","This film does have appeal. I found it to be light-hearted fun along with another Spielberg film that had a similar tone (Catch Me if You Can). Of course, Hanks is masterful, Zeta-Jones is beautiful and Tucci is incredible in his role as a customs agent. I think most viewers will like or liked the cat and mouse banter between Hanks and Tucci's characters. It reminded me a little of how Forrest Gump kept beating the odds stacked against him.<br/><br/>Unfortnately, half way through this film you begin to look at your watch. I kept thinking enough is enough. Please just get to the point. It is far too long for a film of this type and the payoff at the end did not justify the lengthiness of this film. I was hoping for an ending with more substance. It doesn't follow formula when it comes to the quasi-relationship between Zeta-Jones and Hanks which is refreshing, but at the end of the film I felt like saying, ""Okay, what was this whole exercise for?"" I give it a 5 because it lost me halfway through the film."

The only exception is the pretty immigration clerk (someone Saltana), whose pretty brightness shines through Spielberg's attempt to make her a mindless bureaucrat. The Indian janitor is just annoying in his stupid suspiciousness, and his luggage and food handling buddies make Cro-Magnons seem like geniuses.<br/><br/>No, not a single character to like or identify with. Even Hanks, at his skillful best, cannot breath any sympathy into the character of the moronic Navorsky.<br/><br/>Why, when the Feds find Navorsky cannot understand English do they communicate with him exclusively in that language? Why are they trying to starve him into breaking the law? Why was Catherine Zeta-Jones even in the picture? Why is every person walking through the airport so uniformly ignorant? Does Spielberg really think so poorly of his fellow Americans? After the first five minutes, I was looking at my watch and wondering if the movie was ever going to end. I squirmed through the entire first hour and finally said to myself, I don't care about any of these people, and life is too darn short to waste on this piece of garbage!"

With Steven Spielberg directing it and 'big' actors as Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones starring in it, I hadn't expected otherwise, yet I was still very much impressed by the movie. Tom Hanks plays a guy from an East-European, fictional country, who hardly speaks any English. It's unbelievable how convincing and with how much charm he presents the part, which made me instantly love the movie.<br/><br/>The story itself is of course brilliant. It follows a guy who hardly knows the difference between yes and no in English, around JFK airport, because he's stuck there since his country has gone to war and technically no longer exists. Victor Navorski's clumsiness, but irresistible charm and inventive nature, combine both humor and drama into this amazing film. Add Catherine Zeta-Jones as a possible love interest for Victor and the film is complete.<br/><br/>Without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in quite a while, not in the last place because of Tom Hank's brilliant acting. 9/10"

"actionlad","8","6","12","3 January 2005"," A brave movie that ends happily without the Hollywood Ending
","The Terminal is a film that seems to be written for an actor like Hanks. Like the films Castaway and Catch Me If You Can, it's very character-driven. At times, the story loses its direction, but it could be intentional on the part of Spielberg (and the screenwriters), because that's the way the main character (Victor Navorsky) feels.<br/><br/>The film follows Navorsky as he lands at the JFK airport in NYC and eventually learns that he is stuck in the international lounge of the airport due to the dissolution of his homeland and the fact that the US will not immediately recognize the new government. As Navorsky begins to learn of his new predicament and how to cope, he makes mistakes and must use his mind to come up with alternate methods to get food, shelter, money and work. Truly, in many ways, Navorsky's story embodies what the mythological American Dream is all about with him using resourcefulness to show a sort of rugged individualism that causes him to ""pull himself up by his bootstraps."" That is one of the great strengths of the films script. <br/><br/>The other great strength is the much welcomed femininity of Zeta Jones' character about halfway through the film. At some points, the viewer might wonder how this relationship is going to resolve itself before the end of the film with Zeta Jones as the promiscuous flight attendant and Hanks as the wandering, yet trapped foreigner. Well, I'm happy to say, the writers make the brave choice with her character that isn't Hollywood. At the same time, she still seems to redeem herself.<br/><br/>If I had to find a weakness, it would be that antagonist, Stanley Tucci's character (as the airport director) really isn't all that much of an antagonist for most of the film, making the eventual conflicts between his and Hanks' characters seem a bit flat.<br/><br/>Overall a brave film with a lot of great themes."

","This film was a roller coaster ride for me. Initially, I was told be practically everyone this film stunk. One person said it was ""artistic"" (and I now disagree). The film started off slow and tedious, focusing on the main character's language barrier. By halfway, I admit I was in love with this film. I was eager to see what would happen next -- the ways the character gets food and money are very interesting. But the honeymoon was short and by the end, I wished this film a spot in eternal damnation.<br/><br/>The story, if you don't know, is of a man who uses his citizenship in midair because his country plunges into civil war. Not being able to go home, and not able to enter America on a now-bogus passport, he ends up trapped and living in the JFK Airport.<br/><br/>The film stars Tom Hanks (who is given way more credit than he deserves) and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Also, there is an Oompah Loompah that juggles and spins plates. Sadly, this guy is the most interesting character in the film.<br/><br/>My minor beef is the ""product placement"" that runs rampant in this film. Burger King, Borders, and a dozen other stores must have poured millions of dollars into this movie. My major beef is the ""far-fetched"" complaint. At first, it starts out believable. But soon, the airport security chief becomes a monster and a caricature of evil. Hanks builds things -- walls and fountains -- in the airport without security caring, and rips chairs out of the ground. He befriends people and exchanges favors, falls in love with a gorgeous flight attendant (who annoyingly brings up obscure Napoleon facts for no reason at all the wrong times) and in some scenes has what looks like a thousand employees working as his entourage. I don't happen to believe this.<br/><br/>A point for Steven Spielberg. While he usually pumps out mediocre crap, this film is different. It's still mediocre crap. But it's mediocre crap that doesn't rely on aliens, Jews or little boys to sell the story. Thanks Steven, I appreciate the fact Tom Hanks didn't have to fight off aliens in the terminal to save a Jewish boy. (Although in fairness all directors have their themes.) Is this film recommended? Of course not. If you like Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, that's your first mistake. Don't make renting this movie your second mistake."

The writer of this script basically thinks: Oh, he can't speak English, so he must be idiot. Victor Navorski acts like he escaped out of madhouse.<br/><br/>The characters have no personality at all. They are very superficial. The story line says that they are in love, but you can't see it when you look in the characters when they are not around each other.<br/><br/>And the end was terrible too, because no sensible man is willing to wait such a long time for an autograph, which is hard to believe anyway because all the 57 jazz-musicians didn't die in all those years.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."

","Its more nodoze a la Spielberg. What a bad bad bad director. Even though I did not know who directed this until nearly the end and checked the DVD I had checked out from the library. So at least I did not have to ask for my money back. Hanks lets his accent jump around like a ping pong ball, and the only reason I kept watching the thing was to see just how bad it would get. Probably, and this is only probably, Spielberg wanted to go after no calorie Kafka with this, kind of a ho ho combo of The Castle and The Trial thrown in. Though this baby makes Welles Trial a bloody masterpiece, and that movie is plenty bad enough. But I should throw in a proviso here: even Jaws never frightened me. Robert Shaw did a lot more than the shark, he is such a fine actor, so I am still waiting for Spielberg to scrape together ten minutes of continuous celluloid that I can enjoy. For those of you who can, rave on, more power to you. Even Schindler's List struck me as a crafty shuck, carefully avoiding the real horrors of the holocaust, though in all fairness, thus far only Resnais's Night and Fog approached them. Wait. Nearly forgot. There were a few moments in Catch Me If You Can that I thought were well done. Just the sort of territory that might make Spielberg work: the De Caprio character a figure of fantasy taken from the canvas of reality, though greatly hoked up by Spielberg. But at least it was a fairly enjoyable movie. However that's just me. Seem to be the only one around saying that this particular emperor not only has no clothes but big big warts all over him."

","Funnily enough I saw this one on a plane, which is never the best place to see a movie, but I was in an 'airport' frame of mind, so the film managed to strike a chord with me. Flying is the ultimate process in which you spend time where you don't want to be in order to get where you want to be, and the related frame of mind is similarly restless. The focus of this film is on people who are stuck in the midst of this shiftless world, but stuck for differing reasons.<br/><br/>Our main character, Navorski (played by Tom Hanks) has slipped into a 'crack' in the international immigration system, unable to get into the US, and unable to go home. He therefore has to live in the airport, waiting to escape into New York. He meets a variety of people whilst he waits. He befriends a man waiting for an opportunity to talk to a beautiful immigration controller, who in turn is waiting for love. He meets a cleaner waiting for the courage to face justice in India. He meets a beautiful air stewardess who is waiting for a good man. Navorski is waiting to fulfil his father's aim, for which he waited his whole life. His fate is controlled by a man waiting for promotion, and so it goes on.<br/><br/>Navorski is a selfless and good person. He helps others whenever he is able, and the end result is that he is helped to his goal by those who he assisted along the way. Finally, he achieves his goal, completes the father's collection of jazz legends and goes home.<br/><br/>The moral? Good things come to those who wait, I guess. I landed and went home, and I was much happier there."

","When I had heard that a movie was coming out about a immigrant trapped in an airport terminal due to bureaucracy, I was intrigued. My reaction was, ""how could this be made interesting or funny""? An airport is such a sterile environment, what could the writers create over 90 minutes that would be funny? I was right. The movie was a bore. Millions of dollars were spent to recreate a sterile environment.<br/><br/>The writers use the premise that immigration waits, paperwork, and airport security are funny. Let me tell you, my friends it is not funny & you have to wonder that maybe the ""evil"" Federal bureaucracy sweats out every day trying to make sure that threats to society do not make it into the United States of America. This is not comedy material, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Now about the errors. Catherine Zeta-Jones, as the Flight Attendant,love interest is far too glamorous to have to fawn over the Tom Hanks character. In real life, a woman of that physical attractiveness & intelligence could pick & choose who she wanted. She would never be desperate. <br/><br/>How about Tom Hank's accent & how fast he learned English. Was he taking a speed reading/speaking course that not only taught him to speak English but to learn the alphabet specifically since he was used to the Cyrillic alphabet in Eastern Europe. Can you imagine what a laugher this would be to Eastern Europeans? It is a transparent situation. <br/><br/>Finally, you have to wonder why would Spielberg & Hanks lend their names to this movie. Have you have ever bought an appliance, computer, or car that was a brand name but learned that the quality or product had changed. People love Spielberg and Hanks, this is a product that they should not have had a connection to & would have been a movie for TV not on the big screen."

Hanks plays Viktor, coming to America from a fictional Eastern European country and finding himself stranded at the airport.<br/><br/>A revolution erupted in his country and his passport is confiscated. Instead of being deported or arrested and because of the maniacal behavior of the airport security supervisor, Viktor finds himself living in the terminal.<br/><br/>Hanks plays Viktor with a heavy accent and mannerism, but does not manage to make his character sympathetic. An eccentric who does not want to divulge the reason for his journey, Viktor finds support from airport workers and gets mixed in their life. He also manages to carry on a very unlikely love story with beautiful flight attendant Amelia (Zeta-Jones), but the love story feels contrived at best.<br/><br/>My idea of airport terminals is that they are the quintessential passing-through area. My idea of nightmare would be to be stuck in one, so for me it is impossible to understand why Viktor decides to stay rather than taking his chances by getting out. This is linked to the reason of this journey, but it is also very contrived.<br/><br/>Claustrophobic, pointless and annoying, especially when we finally get the revelation of Viktor's purpose in New York – yet another over-sentimental cliché from Spielberg."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","5","1 October 2012"," I finally watch it. Yes, this movie was worth the wait.
","Terminal: dying: affected by a fatal illness or condition that is approaching its final stages. This movie isn't that. The Terminal, to me, was a comical representation, presented with a serious almost adventurousness, of the Airline system. A foreign man play by Tom Hanks to come to America *for reasons known later*, was held up at an airport, as his small almost unknown made up country goes into a revolution which no one will acknowledge the country. This presents a problem for the foreigner. Since now that his country is gone, he can't be taken into America, for some odd paper work reasons forcing him to wait at the airport which really does seem realism at all. It's doesn't in any source. If you understand that silly odd plot line, you will find Tom Hanks's being told by those in charge tell him to wait, expecting him to leave. They want him to leave, where he will be someone else problem likely to pick up as an illegal alien. He doesn't, and proceeds to carry out his life in an airport. At first, he has a hard time surviving in the terminal leading him to risk going outside. The Terminal actually address some language issues between those who work at the airport and those traveling over seas as Viktor has a hard time speaking English. Then he gets an 'Under the Table' job at the terminal, makes some money, and feeds himself and makes the terminal his community. This makes it, a little bit more weird, and he falls in love with a flight attendant play Catherine Zeta Jones who is having an affair with a married man, (a complete DO NOT EVER DO) scenario, and that never works out in the end. I think this is the downside of the plot. The named situation of this is the girl the foreigner meets in the terminal. She is admitting causing an affair with a married man, and doesn't seems to want to stop. This is Hollywood writing all the way, and it very much disturbing. It really doesn't have anything to do with the other plot. On the good side, the Terminal has that rich blend of humor, emotion, and anticipation. The movie isn't much of an action thriller, but it has the attributes of an overall terrific movie. The humor of this movie was superb. A good laugh here and there, and the movie definitely does not overuse humor like a lot of movies do. Emotional twists are another strong point of this movie. Anticipation of the unknown created by these twists will keep you on your toes too. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, (9 to be exact) and Viktor finally gets out of the airport when the revolt is over and the last part of the movie is one of those emotional twist turns. In conclusion, the Terminal is an excellent movie just not as good as the other Spielberg's films."

","It's a shame that Spielberg transformed Mehran Karimi Nasseri's real life nightmare into a sappy love story with a happy ending.<br/><br/>Nasseri was an Iranian who sought political asylum in Britain, but lost his visa while in transit. Britain forced him to return to his previous connection in France, where for eighteen years he attempted to wade through bureaucracy and even a short stint in prison.<br/><br/>Except for a couple of months in jail (it may have been less), he resided at the airport the entire time, ordering the same exact meals from the airport's Burger King each day. He loved economics and became extremely well-versed in it during his stay.<br/><br/>A lawyer at last was able to help Nasseri obtain legal status. Nasseri, who claimed to be the son of a British mother and Persian father, refused to sign a document with Mehran Karimi Nasseri written on it, but insisted it read Sir Alfred Mehran -- his 'true' name. He subsequently returned to the airport.<br/><br/>So the story is really much darker, with a touch of mental illness involved. The fact that this was even allowed to happen, and that a sick man was not tended to for so long is where the real drama lurks. Mehran was eventually sent to a French halfway house after spending almost two decades on the same bench.<br/><br/>Spielberg, felt he had to anglicize Mehran and transform him into essentially Andy Kaufman from Taxi. It became a quirky little film rather than something that could have been more akin to A Beautiful Mind with a touch of bureaucratic torture involved. Maybe someone could have told the story correctly and intelligently, though I doubt they will in fear of copying Spielberg's bastardization of the man's life."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","3","5","20 September 2010"," What a wonderful movie!
","Steven Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" is in my honest opinion, as fine and funny a comedy as any ever made. By adapting a similar approach to a French filmmaker that Spielberg admired and taking a style nostalgic of Frank Capra's best, he created an extraordinary little film that is very humorous and rich with quality and depth. I have continually regarded Steven Spielberg as the finest director working in Hollywood today and one of the all-time masters of his craft. ""The Terminal"" exemplifies his range of talents as he can make harrowing epics like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" thrillers like ""Jaws,"" exercises of awe (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Jurassic Park"") and he know how to make a comedy that can not only generate a few genuine laughs, but make you grin and warm your heart. And that is what he accomplished with ""The Terminal."" Instead of a slapstick would-be laugher with tiresome clichés and aggravating characters, Spielberg reverts back to that wonderful era of sweet, inoffensive gentleness with charming characters and fascinating scenarios. His star is Tom Hanks, playing a man from a fictional Eastern European nation. Hanks arrives at a New York airport terminal on the same day his country is embroiled in a war and as such, officially ceases to exist. Because of this and a complicated reason explained by the immigrations official marvelously played by Stanley Tucci, he cannot leave the terminal and must live there until further notice. Without a country and with few belongings, Hanks's character of Viktor Navorski begins to adapt to life in the terminal, getting to know the employees, and befriending a beautiful but unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones).<br/><br/>This is a wonderful, original premise inspired by a true story. Mr. Spielberg's production designer Alex McDowell constructed a life-sized set of an airport terminal using jet hangars and the detail is absolutely extraordinary. It is nearly a sin that McDowell's name did not appear on the Oscar nominees list the following year. But the real genius in how this set is used goes to Mr. Spielberg. When he started out as a filmmaker, Spielberg was regarded as the expert on lenses and lights. He can do that and direct drama efficiently at the same time. The way he creatively uses lights and camera movement is absolutely fantastic, creating a sense of joy and humor in the physical elements of the picture as well as the story. The floors and ceilings are so wonderfully lit that it makes an airport terminal, usually thought of as being dull and boring, seem like a beautiful paradise.<br/><br/>But Mr. Spielberg's true genius is the way he directs this story and directs his actors. Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Hanks make a more than effective team and wonderfully construct this character, who is not made into an utter bumbler or aggravating, but as a lovable, optimistic man who is making the best out of what he has. His character reminds me of characters played by James Stewart and Joe E. Brown in the good old days. Mr. Hanks does not go around punching people's lights out or running around naked as a lot of comedians these days are reduced into doing. And yet, when using his accent, he never goes over the top. He never strikes a false note. It's one of Hanks's most sweet and pleasant performances since ""Big"" and ""Forrest Gump."" Also enthralling about the story is the way Hanks (and we) delve into life at the terminal. What goes on when one works there. We get to know the people, such as a lovesick employee (Diego Luna), a loyal but unsure security chief (Chi McBride), and a suspicious janitor (Kumar Pallana) with a past.<br/><br/>However, the most enchanting and wonderful scenes, the ones that remind me so much of Frank Capra's classics, are the moments between Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is enchantingly great as the flight attendant he befriends. It is truly fascinating to watch the friendship between these two wonderfully constructed and acted characters develop into something very pure. Zeta-Jones is absolutely wonderful in her role and her character is not a cut-out or two-dimensional. She is not slutty or provocative. She is a three-dimensional human being with an involving story. Just the same as the character played by Hanks. Mr. Spielberg is an artist. The great critic Gene Siskel once said that great directors play their audiences like a piano. In these moments, Mr. Spielberg does better. He plays on our hearts like he would a violin. And he's pulling on the strings to produce something beautiful.<br/><br/>""The Terminal"" is one of the highlights of my recent movie-going experiences. I loved every single bit of it. When I first saw the picture shortly after its released, it absorbed me and drew me in hook, line, and sinker. Now looking on it for a second time, I can only say that I've come to adore it more and that this shall mount up as two viewings multiply. What a wonderful movie!"

","""The Terminal"" is a delightful little comedy from Steven Spielberg's directorial chair. It centers on the plight of Victor Navorski (Hanks), who becomes stranded at the airport when his country erupts into a bloody civil war, where he meets Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones).<br/><br/>I found the movie's plot to be fascinating, full of interesting possibilities. Tom Hanks delivers a top-notch performance, and he really has some fantastic chemistry with Zeta-Jones. But when it comes to Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), I really have to give the writers a hand here. What a temptation there would be to make Dixon a sadist, an unsympathetic caricature of corruption, bent on Hanks' elimination from ""his"" airport. But no. Dixon insists Navorski must break the law. ""I'm not gonna lie"" he says, ""especially to get rid of someone like Viktor Navorski."" He's a man so caught up in bureaucracy, he's become completely indifferent to the immigrant's plight, evidenced when he refuses to let a Russian man take medication home to save his ill father, because the man hasn't got the proper forms. Critics have focused almost exclusively on ""The Terminal""'s romance between Viktor and Amelia, but when examining the movie a little closer, you can see that it is in reality a scathing political commentary by Steven Spielberg in the guise of a light romantic comedy. It critiques how, as a society, we have forgotten about the immigrant's plight in place of stricter, xenophobic security.<br/><br/>Of course, now I'm making it sound as if this film were not funny at all. Au contraire! The situations Viktor gets into at the airport are hilarious, Spielberg's comic relief working overtime. A true Hollywood rarity this is: a comedy with thought behind it. After the dreadful toilet humour ""comedies"" of late (such as the ""American Pie"" or ""Austin Powers"" films), we can take relief in the quirky humour ""The Terminal"" has to offer. I sincerely believe this film has the chance to become a classic."

It feels like a betrayal, in fact. The first hour of this movie or so is very entertaining and, although it trusts way too much on its ability to get natural laughs from the audience (and it reiterates some ""funny"" situations too much), it still manages to create some hilarious moments with a great sense of pacing.<br/><br/>Then it goes horribly downhill. Victor Navorski starts learning English, and we discover that what he has to say is not interesting at all, in facts it reads like a deleted scene of ""Forrest Gump"". A romance with Catherine Zeta-Jones comes out of the blue, and we can foresee the ""romantic comedy"" strategies of delaying the kiss and having a convoluted and pointless discussion before the final reconciliation. So, it doesn't end in a happy hug. But that fact makes this subplot even more pointless.<br/><br/>So, if you ask me, it's a convoluted, poorly written and ill-conceived mess of a movie, with a few occasional comedic achievements."
"Bayhound","Null","3","5","21 June 2004"," Appropriately titled.
","This movies is appropriately titled the terminal, because it is a terminal movie, as in terminally bad, and I mean that as in many ways. But it was decent at some parts, I'll give it that, it was better than some of Steven Spielberg's other movies, but not quite as good as his best movies. It would have been better if he had put more flying in it, which would have been appropriate since it took place in an airport. But by flying, I mean flying like in the movie Hook, not like in Saving Private Ryan, I mean like magical flying, because at least that way something more interesting could have been happening on the screen.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks stars as Viktor Navorski, a Russian man with a bad Russian accent.<br/><br/>He is stuck in the airport, because of some political malfunctioning, but not to worry, because he is stuck in the airport with some interesting people. The supporting cast includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride, and Kumar Pallana all in supporting roles. This was a pretty good role for Tom Hanks, but he definitely shouldn't get any awards for it, because it wasn't his best work, or even as good as his best work. Also, I don't like how Tom Hanks keeps playing older characters, because he did his best work when he played younger people, like in Big, Bosom Buddies, and Burbs. I know your probably saying, but he's getting older, but there's make-up for that, just look at how young Tobey Maguire looks in most of his films.<br/><br/>But the rest of the supporting cast do good jobs too, for the most part at least. I wasn't too fond of Chi McBride, because he always looks the same in every TV show and movie he does, he's always playing a big black man who is in some sort of position. But his name bothers me too, because mostly I think it sounds like a girl's name. McBride for one thing sounds like a girl, cause as we know, only girls can be brides, except for in San Francisco, but he doesn't seem to be that type of bride, if you know what I mean. And then his first name I just can't pronounce. Speaking of last names, why didn't Catherine Zeta-Jones change her last name when she got married. She could've been Catherine Douglas, but then I don't think it's good for people to have last names as first names anyways. But if she really loves her husband and isn't just with him for his money and looks, then maybe she could have at least hyphenated it, like Zeta-Jones-Douglas, but I'm not too fond of hyphenated names in the first place, except for Sarah Michelle-Gellar. But Kumar Pallana was good and funny in the movie too.<br/><br/>Anyway, I won't give away the ending, even though it's not surprising at all, but it's still better than the ending of some of Spielberg's other movies, like Jurassic Park, where the Pterodactyls were flying away in the end. But I did like that flying, too. Maybe this movie would've been better if it had real dinosaurs in it, instead of just Tom Hanks, who is starting to look like one, but only a small one that looks like a human. Maybe then this movie wouldn't have been such terminal garbage."
"D_Burke","10","4","8","26 January 2009"," Excellent, Underrated Film- The ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of the 21st Century
","""The Terminal"" is a movie that opened in theaters in the summer of 2004, quickly disappeared, and has sort of gotten a bad rap ever since. I saw it on DVD in November 2004, shortly before Thanksgiving, and absolutely fell in love with the film. I say it's the ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of the 21st Century because the two films have a lot in common. They were both directed by A-List directors, had an A-List actor as the lead, are feel good films, initially didn't do as well at the box office as they should have, and would not seem out of place when played during the holidays. In at least a decade from now, this film will be considered a modern day classic. Mark my words.<br/><br/>So why was it so great? First and foremost, Tom Hanks played Viktor Navorski so well, and sold every scene he was in. Hanks never played a foreigner before, or at least not one that didn't speak much English. Here, he pulled off something not many other actors could do. Not only did his character not speak very much English, but you could really see in Hanks' eyes the fear, confusion, and oblivion of being stranded in a foreign country with little means, and through no fault of his own. There aren't many other American actors who could do that good a job at acting the role so convincingly.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci was also relatively flawless in his performance as Frank Dixon, director of the Homeland Security branch of the JFK Airport. Tucci has a difficult role here as the straight man, not to mention the occasional bad guy in some situations. However, Tucci never misses a beat, and this role could be regarded as his best so far. Often times, I found myself wondering why Frank Dixon wanted Navorski out of the terminal, then towards the end didn't want him to go to New York. I'm sure there's an explanation somewhere, but this one plot inconsistency didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film at all.<br/><br/>The interactions between Frank Dixon and Viktor Navorski are classic, and often times very funny. Probably the best scene between him and Hanks, besides when they first meet, are when Hanks is brought in to translate for the Russian immigrant with pills for his father. Very few scenes make me laugh and cry at the same time, but that one is one of them. It's just a truly remarkable and poignant scene.<br/><br/>Also noteworthy in scenes with both Tucci and Hanks is Barry Shabaka Henley, who played chief officer Thurman. Henley is one of those character actors whose name isn't known, but you immediately see him and say, ""Yeah, I remember him. He was in 'Collateral', and he was also in 'What's Love Got To Do With It'"". He's a good actor, and really shines in this movie.<br/><br/>Additionally, Catherine Zeta-Jones was pretty good in her role. Her character kind of came and went, but she played well opposite Hanks and there was an interesting love story there until the end. Chi McBride, Diego Luna, and Kumar Pallana also provided some great comic relief, but also scenes of heartbreaking poignancy.<br/><br/>Apart from the acting, the set design was incredible. Research shows that the movie was shot almost entirely on a set, not in the JFK Airport. If I hadn't researched that fact myself, I wouldn't have known. Some may argue that showing the stores such as the Sharper Image, Burger King, and Borders were shameful product placement, but they really added a hugely realistic element to the movie.<br/><br/>For a movie with a moderately big budget ($60 million), it's surprising to me that the DVD release of the film (at least initially) has a nice menu, but no special features whatsoever. There's no ""making of"" documentaries (although one did air on HBO prior to the film's release), no director's or actor's commentary, and no deleted scenes. Regardless, it's a DVD that I make it a point to watch at least once a year, if not twice (and I watch a lot of movies, mind you). It's just that good. Besides the acting and the set design, the movie just tells an excellent story. It has not gotten the credit it deserves yet, but it will soon. It's a superb film, and I highly recommend it. Easily one of the best films of this decade (2000-2009) so far."

There was a plot. Something like this: non English speaking alien befriends one hundred people in airport who become his family, his fiancée, his employer, his chef and even an old Indian becomes, wait for it, his clown!! But hold hard here: we have the Hollywood bad guy in the shape of a customs officer/security police, whatever, who is evil incarnate and makes the guy's life hell on earth. See there's nothing else to do in a busy airport but persecute one man. All day. Every day. <br/><br/>But don't forget the 100 friends and the by now ex-fiancée who bail our little bubble head out. Tom looks exhausted all through it, maybe he realized it could kill his career, hard to tell. Catherine slums around as a flight attendant who only gets home once a month (yeah, right)and reads Napoleon biographies for fun (yeah, right). <br/><br/>We should all get our money back twice for having to sit through this appalling mess. The double indemnity clause. <br/><br/>And BTW when does a country have the same name as its major city?? <br/><br/>And just about every product on the planet was dropped in and promoted in this living hell. <br/><br/>I'll stop now, I need to get a life outside this bilge I've just watched. <br/><br/>3 out of 10, for the set design only.

"noizyme","7","4","8","24 November 2004"," Sweet, tear-jerker that sums up Hanks' performances
","Tom Hanks is known as the character-actor that brings out the kid in us through his performances on screen, and this movie is no exception. Hanks plays a foreign visitor from Krakozhia, which happens to not be recognized by the U.S. government at the time due to war in the country. Because the country is not recognized, he cannot get a visa into the U.S., so Hanks is forced to sleep in the terminal of this New York airport until further information is gathered for him. He meets people who work in the airport and tries to get a job when he finds a girl who steals his heart and leads him on a path of discovery in the American culture of work and friendship.<br/><br/>This is a sweet movie, like most of Hanks', with a lot of endearing moments for his character when you see his willingness to stay and change with his surroundings. I think some people saw this as a political film, largely because of the specific laws involved with releasing foreign visitors to the U.S. soil, and the timing to put this movie out after all of the talk of war, elections, and trusts being juggled around was a bit controversial. I loved the idea of showing how much trust to give this man and allowing him to stay in a terminal instead of locking him up for actions that he never made against anyone.<br/><br/>The movie looses touch with reality (making this a great sob-film by tugging at the IL' heart-strings) when it gets around the end, and all this man wants to do is one simple thing and then wants to leave the city. That didn't really appeal to me. And, as great as Catherine Zeta Jones was in this film, Jones had almost uncanny expressions like those used by Meg Ryan in all of the movies the her and Hanks were known for. That felt a bit eerie, I must say.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave the pretty typical vote of 7/10 (like most are giving it at this time of writing this) for the sweetness, timing, acting, and originality. Definitely rent this now that it is on DVD (although don't expect much from the special features right away...the copy I have doesn't have that many.)"
"bombalurina1","1","5","11","19 January 2007"," Awful
","I was shocked to see how good the ratings for this movie are here on IMDb because this movie, to put it briefly, is CRAP. Tom Hanks does a good job as Viktor Navorski and the plot about a man who is trapped in an airport due to a technicality could be an interesting one. But Steven Spielberg treats his viewers as idiots and tells a story where nothing makes sense, expecting us to feel an emotion simply because the soundtrack is telling us to do so. Why does Frank Dixon hate Navorski so much? Why is the hot stewardess played by Catherine Zeta-Jones enchanted by him? If his friends were going to be fired, why did he go to New York anyway? Couldn't they find an old Indian guy who were a better actor? And if Navorski finally made to New York after all this trouble, couldn't he at least go to the Statue of Liberty or something too? Did he only have time for the jazz show? This movie is an excuse for the advertising of Burger King, Nike and other brands that are shoved down our throats with barely any excuse. Don't waste your time."

The ACLU would've represented Hank's character and he'd been let into America within days.<br/><br/>There's lots of CUTE moments and weird characters, you could see Spielberg trying to flex his Frank Capra fingers, but he doesn't quite get it. Spielberg is still a great visualizer, but he needs to pick better scripts. Also, Catherine Zeta Jones' character is so unbelievable, she's TOO flaky. Stanley Tucci's character is so one dimensional: he's too selfish, too cold, too vengeful.<br/><br/>Maybe Spielberg was trying to create a light fable about waiting in limbo and the great people you meet there.

Compared to 'The Terminal', 'Minority Report' plays like 'The Third Man'. <br/><br/>The movie is naturally technically perfect. Why was it made? I speculate the movie wants to be a very subtle and noble piece of art concocted to denounce the oppression of a pure but honest European guy by the cold and not humane American administration. The end result is so simplistic and exploitative that I found the movie simply insulting and hateful. The only word which comes to my mind is trash. <br/><br/>As for Tom Hanks' acting, which I usually love, well...no comment. A final note: the character of C.

And I happen to be a Kafka fan, so I've read a little bit about unchecked mindless bureaucracies, and when properly portrayed they're as funny as they are scary; The Terminal was neither.<br/><br/>It seemed that the whole airport staff was totally ignorant. Several people kept talking to him in English, even acknowledging that they knew that he couldn't understand what they were saying. They also acknowledged that they needed an interpreter, and even though he was showing them his translation dictionary, and they acknowledged that he had a translation dictionary, no one tried to use it to help the situation.<br/><br/>It might have been used as a joke if somebody had suggested that the Stanley Tucci character was an ignoramus, and had him demoted or if someone had filed a lawsuit, or otherwise pointed out the incompetence.<br/><br/>But alas I couldn't wait that long. I don't know whether I'm proud or embarrassed that I was able to survive watching 30 min of this totally ridiculous / aggravating / silly waste of time of a movie.<br/><br/>I can't believe that Tom Hanks did this movie; I can't believe that it ever got made at all.

","I could say that I am not a fan of comedy nor romance movies and i do not expect much from them. In this case I got much more than expected and I could say that this is the best rom - com I have ever seen. Steven Spielberg once again proved why he is one of a few very best in history of film and with nothing less brilliant Tom Hanks, he made a great tale. With this duo every movie/genre would be nothing but awesome. <br/><br/>Hanks role here is humble, modest, warmhearted, honest Viktor with nowhere to go, being trapped at the JFK Airport, whose country is in war. Character of Viktor is what makes this movie ""Great Emotional Comedy"", personality which could be seen rare nowadays, or could not at all. Personality with heart of a child, positively influencing people around him, personality which we all were once, but we changed with a time and maturity, personality whose honest and warmness should be a role model to all of us, especially to youth.<br/><br/>That is the main reason why I liked and enjoyed watching this movie, Viktor Navorski woke up that child with a big heart in me.

","This movie's opening is quite slow, introducing the environment and the general rules within it. It doesn't wait long and the main character and conflict is introduced very nicely with all the technical jargon in the dialog making it heavy and looking serious. But slowly the story builds on itself well, depending on the elements of Viktor's hardworking nature and lucky encounters. The side conflicts really help the movie builds up until it reaches its finale conflict. The funny little things is what I like from this movie. The comedic moments don't come from any jokes or dialog punch lines commonly found on comedy movies. It's rather made up from all those little things depicted being done by someone with a culture gap and thus also has some degree of culture shock. The acting side is really nice. Tom Hanks can really get into character portraying the man stuck in a hard situation but refusing to break from his nature and code. Stanley Tucci gives the antagonist in his not such hostile role a nice touch, keeping his well known knack for the bad guy roles but still maintaining the approachable presentation. Catherine Zeta Jones also give quite a nice performance in doing the romantic sweetener part."

After that, the film went downhill fast and the jokes became obvious and repetitious. Catherine Zeta-Jones, as a neurotic and self-destructive stewardess, appears several times as the love interest, but instead of appealing to our sympathies, just looked like someone Hanks would be better to stay away from.

"loocirun","4","2","3","25 September 2004"," This is too cheesy to believe it
","I saw this movie and I thought I would have to go and visit the dentist afterwards because of the excessive amount of sweetness on it. It is so sentimental that makes you throw up and you don't believe the story. The photography is well made, except for the scene of the fountain where the lights reflected on it go out of control and not to mention the fake water effect on the walls when the movie make us believe there was no water in the fountain. Except for that, the plot is okay but the way they handle it is too cheesy and they miss the whole point of it. The plot is quite simple: a foreign man has to stay in the terminal because for a moment there is no country for him to return and he has no visa so he has to live in the terminal until his situation is resolved. That's OK; and I know that films are fiction, but since this was based on a true story I don't think that the real man did get that royal treatment. Because, all of us that have gone to any of New York's airports and we are not American citizens, we are not treated with that delicate and kind treatment. As far as I know, no foreign person that has put a step on a NY airport has had any signs of good, even respectful treatment; so I was wondering, why were all the airport staff so nice with him? That is just no real! Anyway, about acting, I don't know about you but Tom Hanks, even if he did a decent job is horrible for comedy movies and not convincing as a Eastern Europe person; not to mention that when he was supposed to speak in the other language you couldn't even hear him, because he couldn't speak it. Then, Diego Luna, over here in Mexico the film company put him in the poster as a big role, when it has a secundary role and of poor quality of acting, considering his other roles. Catherine Zeta-Jones was OK, he didn't have a difficult part to play so she couldn't show her talent to the fullest. Over all, unless you are going with your couple to make out on the films or you are in the excessive cuteness mood, don't watch it!<br/><br/>In my overall opinion 4/10"

"tedg","Null","8","21","22 June 2004"," Stuck in Mellowville
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>If you are an American filmmaker, you live a life registered in American storytelling. And that registration falls into one of two camps, each of which defined their own type of American novel.<br/><br/>One camp was invented by Melville. His notion of the world was rooted in the Bible-as- allegory. He set out to create literature - a uniquely American literature - that had broad, complex sweeps of allegory. It was only incidentally about people and always steeped in some great machine that represented the world. In `Moby-Dick' that world was the world of whaling and whalers.<br/><br/>The tapestry may be complex, but the allegory is clear and distinct. The author takes this allegory very seriously and expects the reader to as well.<br/><br/>The other great stream of America storytelling is from Mark Twain. He tells two stories: the story itself and a story about the story. There are always two narrative levels. This is also uniquely American, especially the nature of humor in the metanarrative. It is immediately based on Austen though the particular notion has roots in Cervantes and Shakespeare. This `twoness' is why Twain chose his name. Twain's aura was of the same colors that would revolutionize the world of introspection with Freud and Darwin.<br/><br/>Why do I mention this? Because nearly all worthwhile films these days are in the `Twain` tradition of storytelling and has been since the `new wave' of the sixties. This `American' notion has spun all sorts of cool varieties, which I am surveying in a book under the rubric of `folding.'<br/><br/>Its just the way it is: to be considered a serious filmmaker, you have to innovate, to invent or twist some way of folding or introspection or reflection. Spielberg is a simple man who makes simple films, films that are to rest of the film world as product wrappers are to art.<br/><br/>Having made enough money, he's been trying to make `important' films so that some day he just might be remembered as someone not unintelligent and unaware of film ideas. He's tried on a few suits, from Kubrick's folding to historical reflections. In each case they seem merely copied and he knows it.<br/><br/>Some years back he tried a real new wave film: `Close Encounters' and even featured Truffaut as the one who `spoke the language.' A couple years ago with Hanks he tried the old folding game of a story about a guy who fabricates stories. Flat. Old shoes.<br/><br/>Here he tries a Melville, a serious, straight ahead allegory. Presumably he thought his audience would be ready for a complex tone poem about what it might mean to be on the threshold of America. The model of the world in this case is the terminal. All sorts of little symbolic episodes are woven in, and one big one: the importance of getting a `real' image, a signature, to go with a false image (a photograph). This is mirrored by his having to get a stamp himself. The very contrast that this blunt agenda of collecting autographs has with the ad hoc nature of the Jazz involved is stark allegory - as stark as the stasis of waiting in a place that everyone else passes through.<br/><br/>Well, as allegory for the masses, it works I suppose. But as film, well it is just another copy.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gets to do Chaplin's Trampwalk.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

The airport terminal surroundings looked terrific, but no way would someone in the pre-security lounge be allowed into the secure baggage handling area, even in 2004.

","The plot of this movie is highly unlikely and incredibly unrealistic. The main characters are also textbook stereotypes with clear black and white good vs evil motivation, as is the supporting cast. The themes are something out of a poorly written children's book. I loved every minute of it. It is not meant to be realistic. It is meant to be a fantasy story with the real world as a backdrop, and it does a terrific job of that. Tom Hanks oozes charisma and after a few minutes you will forget that he is an American. Katherine Zeta Jones is accused of being ""wooden,"" but that is part of her character, and it helps sell her decisions. There is a lot of subtle comedy that works very well, several silly subplots that are very poignant, and the ending is perfect. By all accounts this film should fail on almost every level but it really is a lot of fun, and that's why we watch movies."

Steven Spielberg brings his typical blend of great plot, pacing, characterisation and moments of emotion that will have you cringing in your seat. It's the kind of film that forces you into a good mood and you can't help liking it despite the flaws. The film really displays what a versatile actor Tom hanks really is.

","First of all i would say that is how you make a film without high tech gadgets , Special effects and stunts etc. It is just the beauty of acting and Story line.<br/><br/>If you love acting and story line to make you entertain this is just one of the perfect movies to watch.<br/><br/>I cannot forget the man who brings the extra ordinary masterpiece of acting to this film , MR.Tom Hanks. He is as always the best in the business. He shows to all the new actors who put more faith in stunts and Special Effects that it is not the real case of entertaining people. As an actor it is always ACTING which makes people felt the presence of an actor. <br/><br/>Catherine Zeta Jones also did a wonderful support play to Tom Hanks and should be mentioned with a great respect for her justification to the character as well. <br/><br/>Like every other movie Tom Hanks had touched this film is also not an outcast but again an inspiration to the movie loving fans."

","'SPIELBERG-LITE': (Noun). Intelligence-insulting work produced by a great director choosing to rest on his laurels. See Always (1989), Hook (1991), The Lost World (1997) Minority Report (2002), and now The Terminal.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, reverting to the mush that made him famous, is Viktor Navorski, a New York-bound traveler. Armed only with luggage and a Big Apple tour-guide, he finds himself bereft of a homeland and trapped in JFK airport when war breaks out in Krakozia, the tiny eastern European state from which he hails. Officially, his nation now no longer exists and his passport is 'unacceptable'  he can't set foot on US soil and, until the conflict is ended, can't return home. He is now in the domain of Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci)  the airport's heartless head honcho who, while realizing that Navorski is now obliged to remain in the airport until the Krakozia situation changes, nevertheless embarks on a personal crusade to make life as difficult as possible for his airport's unwanted resident. Ho-hum.<br/><br/>Well-meaning it may be, but that does not excuse what is perhaps the worst Spielberg film, period. Bereft of the enchantment and wonder that make even his most sentimental previous excesses watchable, Terminal labours ponderously towards significance from take-off, without ever getting near its destination.<br/><br/>Hanks, while doing his best in his opening set-pieces to revive the spirit of Chaplin's tramp character, must still take his fair share of the blame  one can only assume that he has, by this stage in his career, an understanding of the difference between scripts that soar, jet-like, or sink like lead balloons, but, judging by the clunking 'romantic' dialogue that he and cabin attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) exchange, one wonders.<br/><br/>And the reasons behind casting the Welsh-whinger will forever remain mysteriousZeta-Jones' personality is well suited to playing hard-nosed bitches á la Intolerable Cruelty and Chicago, but a love-lorn perpetual mistress? Please.<br/><br/>Only Tucci emerges from this mess with any dignity  his character, though merely created to fill the narrative gap where a Spielberg villain would normally reside, is nevertheless witty and nasty enough to provide some much-needed zest. As for the rest, 'directorial artistic decline' doesn't even come close. One can only hope it's not terminal."
"Win14Gipp","7","1","1","23 June 2004"," Check your logic at the gate
","(As always, a warning: Yon be spoilers.) This film is a witty and likable send-up of American life in general and air travel in particular. In fact, it's the best send-up of travel since ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,"" as well as a film Kafka would allow his kids to see.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks seems to do his best work when he plays someone we should like, and he delivers once again as a foreign traveler caught in some bureaucratic cross-fire and forced to spend nine months in a terminal at JFK. (One wonders how different the movie would be if he had landed at a less-cushy airport -- say, Miami.) Most of his scenes are winners, primarily because Hanks also brings the best out of his fellow actors, particularly Stanley Tucci, the airport official who, for reasons that are not entirely clear, decides that letting Hanks enter the U.S. would be a personal defeat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film also has its flaws. First, Spielberg hasn't asked us to suspend this much disbelief since ""A.I."" (It takes less time for Hanks to gain a fluency in English than it does for Tucci to find an interpreter?) Second, even though Hanks and the equally talented Catherine Zeta-Jones sparkle in their scenes together, the resolution of their budding affair leaves you unfulfilled. (Would it kill ya to let someone other than Indiana Jones get the girl for once, Steve?) Third, when you learn the true nature of Hanks' mission, you're left shaking your head. (Trust me on this one.)<br/><br/>But again, Hanks' performance justifies these flaws, even if it doesn't overshadow them. If you can believe that a man can live for weeks at a time on crackers and Whopper Jr.s, go enjoy Hanks and the rest of the cast. Just don't buy the screenplay to read on your next flight."
"synapse3119","Null","1","1","21 June 2004"," Not as disappointing as ""Big Fish"", but still kind of a let-down.
","""The Terminal"" is the second highly anticipated movie this year by a big name director that, halfway through, had me sighing in disappointment.<br/><br/>The first was Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"", a movie so contrived and lifeless it made me wonder what happened to the wonder kind who gave us Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>The Terminal wasn't AS bad, and, in fact, has some really great moments only a director like Spielberg and an actor like Tom Hanks could deliver. There's a sequence in the beginning where Navorski discovers his home country has fallen into warfare and disarray, and desperately, fearfully runs around the Terminal looking for television sets that broadcast some snippet of news he's unable to understand anyway. This is a heartbreaking scene and I noticed I was sobbing only 15 minutes into the movie. This was a glorious setup that had me expecting a truthful, emotional, and brilliant Spielbergian parable on the hardships of immigration and the response they get from the country to strive so hard to come to. Granted, Navorski wasn't an immigrant, he was just a tourist, the obvious story to be told was about East meets West.<br/><br/>Instead, my blood started to chill and my shoulders sagged in my seat as the film fell victim to one cliché, forced Hollywood contrivance after another. Yes, Gupta the Janitor was funny but his dialogue was dismal (do you have an appointment? -not funny. a writers device trying to be ""eccentric"".)<br/><br/>The relationship Navorski develops with the airport workers was comic and touching on some levels (Chi McBride was brilliant as always and it was nice to see Diego Luna in a non sleazy role for once.) But their characters lacked any sense of realism or depth. The romance between Diego and the Customs Official girl could have been really sweet and compelling had the devices used to move it along (like Diego's bribing Navorski and the whole ""he said/she said back and forth) not felt like the screenwriter was borrowing from the stock bin of Hollywood romances. There was no real sense of a crush or distant love from Luna's character and because of that, it lacked truth. And therefore, why should I bother caring? <br/><br/>That's how I felt about a lot of the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was so self centered and despicable in her devotion to a man she KNOWS is going to hurt her that I rolled my eyes every time she came on screen. Yeah, I get it. She reads history books (writer's device) she rambles on about Napleon (writer's device) and she's so hectic and neurotic in her life that she asks strange foreigners she's never met if they'd like to have dinner (writer's device.) I love Catherine Zeta-Jones and I know she's an amazing actress but her character was a complete fabrication from start to finish. The one, ONE touching moment between her and Hanks comes when he explains to her what's in the Planters can and more so why he came to this country. The acting she does without saying any words was the only other moment in this film where I almost cried, and yet it falls short because neither the setup nor the payoff of the relationship between her and Navorski are fulfilling or honest in any way, shape, or form. (Although, to be fair, their ""date"" on the patio with Gupta juggling the hoops was sheer comic brilliance)<br/><br/>The world of Independent Film has changed my view of movies so profoundly that it's hard, really hard, to watch a Hollywood movie now and not find myself giggling or sighing at the abundance of recycled clichés and untruthful characters. I understand that most of these big studio pictures are produced for one reason: to entertain the majority of the populous, most of whom don't see past the stereotypes and are easily amused, and let them leave the theater feeling good about life. And you know what, that's cool. Everyone deserves to have a good time at the movies. But when that ""good time"" is being helmed by one of the best of the best filmmakers the medium has ever seen, as I'll rightfully say Spielberg is, I expect a little, no, a LOT better than what one of your standard second tier Hollywood directors would churn out. Even when Spielberg is falling back on cliché (Jurassic Park, Minority Report, and, to some extent, Saving Private Ryan), he does it so deft fully and well that it becomes original and stands out as a great film. The Terminal was not so lucky.<br/><br/>It has some great comic moments in the tradition of Buster Keaton, and it's worth watching for Hanks' and Tucci's performance as well as Janusz Kaminski's always awe-inspiring cinematography. But, in the end, you might sit there and wish the filmmakers had done better, if only because you know they can."
"Chromium_5","Null","1","1","21 June 2004"," An excellent movie, that gets kind of weird after awhile.
","Some people are complaining that ""The Terminal"" was terrible because it didn't make an ounce of sense. It's true, the whole concept of ""logic"" has been done away with in this movie, but I don't think the basic idea to begin with is crap... the actual story that it's based on is almost more unrealistic than the movie (Marhan Nasseri was given the chance to leave the Charles de Gaulle airport several times, but he didn't want to).<br/><br/>So, it starts out fine... Tom Hanks is a scared tourist lost in a huge airport, and he can't leave. It was fun to watch him learning how to live in the airport on his own, kind of like a modern Robinson Crusoe.<br/><br/>At some point, though, the movie starts going in another direction, with Hanks befriending the staff, and becoming some sort of cult hero in the airport. This is the point when the movie goes completely bonkers, because things happen that have no rational explanation. In fact, the whole reason Hanks came to America to begin with turns out to be a little shaky. The whole last third of the movie was like a dream.<br/><br/>But even with the psychotic storyline, all the actors give great performances, and that is what makes this an excellent movie. It is all about the characters; they hold the movie up from start to finish.<br/><br/>I thought it was very entertaining. 7/10 stars."
"WilliamSG","Null","1","1","20 June 2004"," Started well...but tapered off...
","'The Terminal', the latest Hanks/Spielberg collaboration is an interesting, and strangely original tale of a Russian stuck at a New York airport. Tom Hanks plays the role of said Russian rather well, even down to the way he walks. He doesn't look too Russian, but of course most people know it's Tom Hanks, so perhaps that's a moot point. What starts as an interesting and amusing jaunt dissipates into sentimental mush, for no apparent reason either. From the two airport workers getting married 'within minutes', to the overbearing 'romantic' music that seemed to envelop viewers close to the ending, - it's as if Spielberg didn't know how to complete this one. One may argue 'well how would YOU complete this movie?'. I would simply respond that 'I have no idea. Perhaps this kind of movie shouldn't have been made?'. And maybe that's the problem. There wasn't enough meat here for the movie to be completed in its entirety. The audience I was with laughed fairly continuously throughout the movie up till the last twenty-or-so minutes where it went eerily quiet. It's a real shame there wasn't enough continuity in the story. <br/><br/>(On a side-note, there was a lot of very iffy cinematography in this movie. For some reason, and it appeared intentional, there was a lot (and I mean a lot) of very soft-lighting. Stanley Tucci is literally enveloped in it when he walks into view during one scene in the airport, and the meeting of Hanks and Zeta Jones at the 'fountain'  hurt the eyes. That's just two examples.. Very odd.)<br/><br/>Overall, a relatively enjoyable movie. It's a shame the ending left such a bitter taste in the mouth."

This movie failed to portray clearly, confidently, or with any conviction any of the emotions we wish to experience during a dramatic adventure.   Love, envy, friendship, greed, desire all half baked into a lukewarm, bland, saccharine sweet pie.    <br/><br/>
Also you might want to question the validity of the imdb voting considering 110 people gave this movie a 10  (Highly unlikely) and the next closest category only 29 people gave it a 9.

","This movie is really really weak in terms of its poor story and its childish jokes! When the movie starts there are a few good moments that give you the feeling that it may have a strong story.<br/><br/>In this movie, there is this man who has problem communicating with people in the airport because he does not know the language. Unfortunate for him, he gets into a big trouble since his visa is not valid anymore due to some revolution in his country. Now this is the scene that I liked about the movie. When you go to a foreign country you need people to be friendly and helpful. However, because these problems are usually a part of the daily routine of the people who work at the airport, they do not care about you. And if there is nobody there willing to help you, you will eventually feel like a ghost because people do not see your problem.<br/><br/>The movie had the potential to be a great comedy drama, but it suddenly turned into a Hannah Montana love story! The character of the chief officer in the airport reminds me of the bad guy in the Inspector Gadget cartoon series. His dialogs cannot get any worse. And what was the marriage at the airport? You cannot simply push a wedding into your screenplay just to make a movie happy!<br/><br/>Altogether, if you change the cast of the movie to some teenagers it will be a perfect fit for Disney Channel. If someone enjoys this type of comedy, there is a good chance that he/she enjoys High School musical and Camp Rock as well."

","I decided to give this film a go even though I knew it had under performed at the box office in America and had been labeled a 'flop' by some critics.<br/><br/>I sat to watch it not sure what to expect but I was pretty much totally won over by it which, considering how very anti-mush I am, is actually quite an achievement. The plot is very simple and it relies totally on us feeling a little bit warm and forgiving  a feeling that the film does well to give to us in an opening hour that is relentlessly charming and amusing. Some viewers will be annoyed by a fragmented feel to the story that, at points, seems to lack a drive but it is the sort of thing that just glides forward slickly and, for that reason, Spielberg was probably the best man for the job. His excessive mush comes through in the love at first sight between Torres and Enrique  for most of their thread it is charming and sweet and hopeful. However Spielberg cannot cope with just ending their story with a meeting and hope, no, he has to go from nothing to marriage in the space of a few seconds in an embarrassing 'Star Trek' moment (and guys; women this hot do not spend all their time at Star Trek conventions  sorry).<br/><br/>I found it annoying but luckily this was only one scene but Spielberg also misjudges an entire thread that just doesn't work at all  the romance between Amelia and Viktor. I feared that it would be used as a big happy ending and, I suppose, am glad it wasn't  but then why bother with it in the first place? If it worked well then it would be a good thread around the others but for the most part it doesn't. Sadly, the main reason is fails is Jones herself. She is pretty, but she is also awful here. She has almost no chemistry with Hanks and she cannot do anything with her character  the moment where her boyfriend goes to a barbecue instead of seeing her didn't convince me at all and just looked like someone unconvincingly pretending to be upset. Later, a moment of honesty with Viktor on the balcony is delivered with no heart but a lot of blinking and eyelid fluttering. It is a shame because I liked the way the film didn't cash in for the big happy ending, but it just didn't work and since it was only a small part of the film, it should have been cut out completely.<br/><br/>Despite this, the rest of the cast are really good. Hanks could have just been absurd with his accent but he pulled it off and convinced me enough to do the job in this type of film. He works well in every scene and it is only the scenes with Jones where I got the impression that he was banging his head against a brick wall. He overdoes the 'big huggable bear' routine a bit too much but it fits with the mood of the film, which itself is a big lovable, huggable thing. Tucci is a nice foil for Hanks and their battle of wills is the thread that holds the whole premise together; he is mean without being beyond redemption or overly cruel, pulling it off that we don't hate him, we understand he is holding to the importance of the rules. Support is generally very good even if their characters are really too 'nice' to convince me that they could exist in real life! Luna overdoes the sweet Hispanic role but is still fitting; Saldana is gorgeous as ever and is really nice in a role that only asks her to slowly melt to be sweetly vulnerability! Pallana is really funny and gets the mindset of labourers pretty well; his reward is a key role in an overblown (but moving) moment that was such a good image I'm sure it will stick in my mind for ages.<br/><br/>The film also makes a point in response to security tightening around immigration and airports  it is a gentle point and I would hesitate to even suggest it were strong enough to be called 'criticism'. The message is to try and look at the people coming to America  they are not all terrorists, benefit spongers, criminals and so on; they are people and deserve a compassion that recent events have shown perhaps doesn't exist to the degree that it could. The film doesn't labour this point and I think many people may not even have noticed it. The point is that we can show compassion to people without the world ending, but that we still need controls (note that Viktor does not stay  even if that would have made a 'happier' ending). The character of Viktor also works as a challenge. We start with him as just a foreigner who speaks little English and is a bit clueless but is developed to the point that we accept him as a person and not on our first impressions: a challenge to the unofficial 'profiling' view of current immigration policies, but not so strong as to suggest scrapping what is in place  just humanising it. Finally, the film reminds us that not everybody in the world actually wants to come and live in the US and chase the American Dream; Viktor's final action in the film? To head home.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this film. It is overly sentimental, flawed and relies on you being totally in the mood for it but it easily won me over. Not a film to watch if you are in a very cynical mood about anything but one that is fun, warming and sweet but also has interesting things to say. The US box office may not say it, but this is a great film."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","5","4","9","18 September 2004"," Mild, meaningless film
","Steven Spielberg used to tackle massive movies that were huge blockbusters and instant classics. Think Jaws, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan. Now he's busy with 'who cares?' little movies with little stories and little meaning. Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal are perfect examples of this. What has happened to Spielberg? Why is he wasting time on easily forgotten stuff like this and not concentrating his efforts on something bigger and better. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is great as Victory Navorsky, the traveler from Eastern Europe who is stranded in JFK airport after war breaks out in his country. He is not allowed to leave the terminal so he settles down in an abandoned departure gate and makes a temporary home for himself. In between mild scenes of mild drama some colorful characters pop up for some mild involvement. The least of which is lecherous Catherine Zeta-Jones as Flight Attendant with no clue who ends up being a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>It's not so hard to believe why Dodgeball beat this to the number 1 spot this past summer. Both movies are instantly forgettable but The Terminal doesn't have much of an audience outside of pensioners (I was the only person under 60 when I went to see, in an almost empty cinema).<br/><br/>With Catch Me If You Can, Steven Spielberg certainly proved he can do simple, non-epic movies. But he also proved that 12 years earlier with Always. Did we really need another one? The only thing worthwhile in the Terminal is John Williams' warm musical score. Which is mild rather than magical."

On the second viewing however, what struck me was Navorski's rather anarchic streak in adjusting to the situation. <br/><br/>There is one thing that really puzzles me, though: Where are all the other people who must have been on the same flight from Krakozhia?

Minority Report was by far one of the best films of 2002, and I loved what he did with Kubrick's A.I., despite the cheesy Mission to Mars rip off of the aliens at the end. <br/><br/>But I thought there wasn't much to Catch Me If You Can. It was a fine film, well-made, but just not much too it, anyone could have made it. So I kind of went into The Terminal thinking it was going to be like that. I bought into the previews thinking, hey, this cheesy high-concept could work, if done right-a man without a country discovers America in JFK airport; it will be a satisfying film. And I'll even admit I've been humming 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' for the last couple weeks.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. The Terminal is an absolutely bogus Hollywood feature, aimed at pleasing the mass audience with dumb jokes, with a horrible script.<br/><br/>Even while writing this, I still can't believe Steven Spielberg directed this load of crap; what was he thinking? Is Spielberg turning into Ron Howard (Ransom, How the Grinch Stole Christmas), or even Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away), doing big budget films just to make money?<br/><br/>*****Spoilers From Here on*****<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski who's stuck at JFK airport because there was a coup in his country. In the beginning, he's taken to Frank Dixon's (Stanley Tucci) office and is told he must not step foot outside the airport doors. The problem is, Viktor doesn't speak any English, and they don't speak his language. This is the first part that leads down a long slope of unbelievability. <br/><br/>I just can't believe they wouldn't have an interpreter at JFK airport. They wouldn't just let a man who doesn't speak English walk around the airport if they weren't sure he didn't understand what was going on. And if Spielberg is trying to criticize immigration into this country, he shouldn't be doing it in a comedic way, making a joke at the fact that Viktor doesn't know what is going on.<br/><br/>He tries to get into the bureaucracy of the immigration laws by showing how Dixon wants Viktor to take advantage of a loophole that would allow him to leave the airport, but Dixon's character is played so bogus, that it's just not believable.<br/><br/>And it really makes no sense why Viktor just doesn't leave. Is it because he just wants to follow the rules? Well later we learn he's learning how to break the rules, how to find the loophole, with the 'goat' incident. The 'goat' scene really makes no sense, because Dixon could just check and see if the medicine is for people or for animals. The whole motivation behind the scene is that he didn't want Viktor to show him up. And he just lets Viktor show him up.<br/><br/>Again, this is just poor writing. The writers felt they needed a bad guy in the movie, when they don't, and made Dixon out to be the stereotypical bad guy, instead of making him seem like a real person. No wonder this is so poorly written, because one of the screenwriters, Jeff Nathanson, wrote both Rush Hour 2 and Speed 2.<br/><br/>Dixon's anger at Viktor makes no sense. Dixon suddenly decides, that because he's angry at Viktor, he's now going to try and keep him at the airport forever. It's a stupid Hollywood device, the protagonist must have an antagonist, or you have no movie. No matter now stupid it plays out.<br/><br/>I'd like to invent a new phrase and call this film: White Water Spielberg. The Terminal is a scam, it's bogus, it's whitebread mass audience appeal, with watered down stereotypical clichéd plot and story.<br/><br/>A lot of the jokes are just plain dumb. Like the coins shooting out at him when he returns a bunch of pushcarts. They didn't shoot out before, just cause a bunch come out at a time doesn't mean they would fly out like that. It's this type of little detail that shows how much Spielberg has turned into the typical director hack sell-out. Stanley Kubrick, who Spielberg took over and directed A.I. after Kubrick's death, would never overlook such details.<br/><br/>The audience was eating up the dumb jokes though, so I guess when you want to make a movie that will have mass audience approval, you have to dumb down the script and write down to the audience. This is done all the time, just not in a movie directed by Spielberg, I expect more from him.<br/><br/>More little details ruin this film as well, like Viktor goes to Borders to buy travel guides on New York City to learn English when he has no money for food. Those travel guides, especially in an airport bookstore, are expensive, probably at least $10 a piece. And when they showed he could just barely afford a $0.75 burger at Burger King (which is also a false price by the way), how could he afford to buy the books. And later it's revealed the Head of Homeland Security Department at JFK makes less than $19 an hour. That's just under $40,000. I highly doubt that is possible. <br/><br/>The subplot with Diego Luna, from Y tu mamá también, is too sentimental, and stupid. It's just not believable that there would be a wedding in an airport, give me a break.<br/><br/>Finally the ending is tied up too nicely. Why would Dixon leave the others alone, once he finds everything out about them. Are you telling me the head of homeland security at JFK airport is going to let a known criminal, a criminal who assaulted a police officer, still work there, and not have him immediately arrested? Great, I feel safe traveling now.<br/><br/>The sentimentality over-kill comes in once more when we learn what Viktor has in his peanut can, and why he came to America. We never find out anything else about him, if he has a family back home, what his job is. But his reason for coming to the US is just plain dumb.<br/><br/>I am just dumbfounded that Spielberg made this film. I guess this is his Planet of the Apes, oh wait, no, that's going to be The War of the Worlds."

","Is this movie really made by the same director that gave us Shindler's List, Jaws and Close Encounters?? What happened to you Steve? Catch Me If You Can wasn't all that good, but this is even worse.<br/><br/>The story in a nutshell: A man from a fictitious country lands on JFK airport (presumably with his private jet, since he's the only one coming from this country) but can't enter the USA because his country's government was erased while he was in the air. So all he can do now is wait and hang around the airport.<br/><br/>This could have resulted in an interesting movie but it's totally ruined by a number of things:<br/><br/>-The cliché image of everybody coming from Eastern Europe being dumb and clumsy<br/><br/>-Tom Hanks delivering one the worst fake accents in Hollywood history (do you know the video game ""Red Alert""? Well, worse then that)<br/><br/>-This is Hollywood so it needs a Romance and a Villain, but neither of them works. I mean, would someone looking like Catherine Zeta Jones really fall for a guy who speaks like that dresses like your math teacher? There is absolutely no chemistry between those two. And this guy Dixon, does he have nothing better to do then bully this poor man?<br/><br/>This movie has just too many stereotype characters and movie clichés along with a very VERY unlikely plot which is also full of holes. I just hope that Spielberg regains his old level of movie making again soon."

","The main purpose of the terminal is to make Liberals feel good about loathing the Department of Homeland Security as a symbol of the US government. And so, director Spielberg endeavors to create a twilight-zone like environment where poor Tom Hanks is trapped as a citizen without a country by evil and ambitious Deputy Homeland Security Director Stanley Tucci. The movie can't even stay true to its own premise for 15 minutes. Tom Hanks is introduced to us as a Khrakozian tourist who can't wait to indulge in popular NYC culture, but is so ill prepared he speaks no English at all. Stanley Tucci tells us He can't grant asylum to this man who lost his country mid-flight because Krakozia is too small and unimportant to America, yet CNN is showing footage of the government coup every five minutes, etc., etc. People are nasty to Hanks throughout the movie's first half for no reason at all, and we are treated to many different camera angles focusing on really hopeless expressions on Tom Hanks' face. I could go on, but I've lost interest -- just as I did in this terrible film."
"k-king2","4","4","11","19 December 2004"," Spielberg + Hanks = ??
","Usually it equals a great experience (SPR, Band of Brothers, Catch me if you can). But this is not the case with Terminal. The magic did not happen, instead it was simply one bad cliché after another. Let's also not forget it was one giant commercial for Burger King, Sabarro's, and especially Borders Books. This was tasteless, lifeless, boring drivel. It was way too long. The customs agent/ food worker love story was weak and meaningless, not to mention that about 1/3 of the way into the movie was the focus of the story and then for 45 minutes there is no mention of it whatsoever. Time progression was handled poorly, I think they said he was there 9 months but you would have never been able to guess that from the movie, I would have guessed 3 months tops. He seemingly went from being English illiterate to quite fluent in a manner of days.<br/><br/>I think Hanks did a decent job with his character and the cinematography was good but the movie was just flat. I can only assume it has a ranking of 7 here at IMDb out of respect to Hanks and Spielberg. If it had been a different director and actor I think it would have the 4-5 rating it deserves. I give it a 4."

"filmbuff20","7","2","4","28 April 2009"," Fun, warm and engaging with Spielberg written all over it.
","Inspired in part by a true event, The Terminal tells the story of Viktor Navorksi (Tom Hanks), a native of the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia, who flies to New York to keep a promise to his father. While Viktor's plane is in the air, there is a military coup, rendering his native country unrecognised and rendering Viktor with an invalid passport and no where else to go. In short, he is unacceptable. Unable to leave the JFK transit lounge or to fly home, Viktor settles in the airport and begins to find new ways to make money, amuse himself and make friends while learning English. In the process he meets Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a troubled flight attendant whose relationship with a married man is beginning to take it's toll. She finds solace in Viktor's friendship, and Viktor develops that inevitable crush...<br/><br/>First of all, the obvious. Spielberg had production designer Alex McDowell build an entire terminal from scratch in an unused airplane hangar. The finished product is extremely impressive, even more so if you know that bit of trivia, so it should stand to reason that the star of the movie would be the set. Not so, as Spielberg proved with Jurassic Park, character and performance can work with technical brilliance rather than be outshone. The evidence of this is in Tom Hanks' mesmerising performance. Hanks infuses Victor with the same childlike wonder as that of his characters in Big and Forrest Gump. He loses himself in the role, from the accent right down to the walk and the blank expression, to the point where you can actually forget you're watching Tom Hanks. Although amusing early scenes have Viktor struggling with the language barrier, it's never at his expense. He's portrayed as a character with obstacles to get over and his resourcefulness in getting over them, never as an object of ridicule. In contrast, Catherine Zeta-Jones' character Amelia is not as likable as one would expect from a love interest, possibly because her character was not originally intended that way and during filming the chemistry between the two made it clear that the connection should be somewhat romantic. She isn't unnecessary, but she does give the impression that she is there solely to develop Viktor himself.<br/><br/>However, the other supporting players, Enrique (Diego Luna of Y Tu Mama Tambien), Gupta (Kumar Pallana) and Mulroy (Chi McBride) as airport employees never fall into the trap of 'annoying comedic padding' and are always amiable, funny and touching when they need to be. This motley crew formed a friendship during filming and it radiates off the screen. The role of workaholic immigration officer Frank Dixon is realised wonderfully in the hands of character actor Stanley Tucci. A flawed and complex creation, Dixon serves as the antagonist of the piece, trying desperately to get a promotion while trying to get Viktor out of his terminal so that he can be someone else's problem. Like Hanks' Carl Hanratty of Catch Me If You Can, it's difficult to label Dixon a bad guy. He's just doing his job, heartlessly and efficiently but is visibly conflicted about what he has to do, following the rulebook stubbornly and ruthlessly. The humanity that Tucci brings to the role elevates him beyond the usual moustache twirling villain.<br/><br/>On the directing side, Spielberg fills each of his frames with goodies. He has an entire airport set to play with and he uses every inch of it with a boyish delight. Despite the enormity of the set, it would still have been easy for it to become claustrophobic, but there's always something pretty to gawk at, Spielberg achieving the seemingly impossible task of making you want to live in an airport terminal. Spielberg has deliberately shied away from all out comedies since his flop '1941', but this movie's comedic element shows that he's gotten over that, flitting effortlessly between action blockbusters, sci-fi and serious historical movies. The only drawback is the overt sentimentality that dominates the last third of the movie. Some would say that this movie earns it's right to be sentimental, but it becomes a tad uncomfortable. Spielberg has been unfairly labelled as a sentimental director, due no doubt to films such as ET, Always and AI, but these people fail to realise that most of his films, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Jaws, Duel and Minority Report to name a few are at their core dark and disturbing in places, so Spielberg earns his right to lash on the weepies once in a while.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's lighting and use of colour is always magnificent, but here he fills each shot with wonderfully rich golds and blues and his style, which has always complemented Spielberg's sleight of hand direction, has never been more suited to his director. The main feat achieved here is the use of artificial light doubling as daylight, something which the average film-goer won't notice, but without it, the illusion of the set would have failed.<br/><br/>John Williams' music is from the same ilk as his Catch Me score. Viktor's theme is an eastern European influenced riff in the form of a mischievous clarinet at the forefront which is instantly memorable and is the kind of theme that'll play a loop in your head for hours afterwards. It adds a further lightness to the film which in turn adds considerably to the overall feel good factor of a film already warming the cockles.<br/><br/>THE BOTTOM LINE: Spielberg has created another 'dessert' of a movie, which occasionally gets a little too sweet and sickly for it's own good, but is engaging enough that it always ensures you'll want to come back for that second helping."

","I love this movie. It's about the closest thing I could see as a sequel to ""Forrest Gump"" without actually seeing tom Hanks play Forrest Gump again. He plays Viktor Navorski, a Bulgarian national from a fiction republic who lose his country in the air and cannot return home, but without a new reclassification, he can't enter the United States so he has to live in the world of the airport terminal. This sequence is highlighted by very convincing CNN scenes of his war-torn homeland. He gets by living by his wits and the kindness of other people, encountering and touching on the lives of people passing through, much like Forrest, and they touch his life in return. The mystery of the can he carries around makes for a good and worthy sub-plot. George Takei appears in the movie where one character is a Trekkie. Catherine Zeta Jones has a wonderful role as a potential love interest that surprises by not having her end up with Tom, a cliché ending that otherwise would have been too predictable."

","""The Terminal"" refers to the JFK International Arrivals terminal in NYC. Tom Hanks (Victor Navorski) arrives at the beginning of the film from the fictional east European country of Krakosia. Unfortunately for him, while he was in the air, Krakosia underwent a coup and his passport is no longer valid for entry into the US. He is a ""man without a country.""<br/><br/>Victor speaks little English, and is denied entry into the US. He is told to ""wait"" in the International Arrivals terminal until it can be straightened out. Again, unfortunately for Victor, this will take many months, and he must learn to live in, and survive in, an airport terminal.<br/><br/>Needless to say, all those among us who have suffered through flight delays and cancellations can relate to Victor's problems. At least when I get stuck in an airport, though, I can speak the language. <br/><br/>I could give you a little more plot, but frankly, you already have most of it. You don't need much more information to get the messages here. Those would be:<br/><br/>1. Sometimes you have to wait for what you want. Victor is a very patient guy. Catherine Zeta-Jones (Amelia Warren, perpetually single flight attendant), not so much. He's a better person for his patience. She has waited forever for her married lover, but will never get what she wants. And she is decidedly unsettled and unhappy as a result.<br/><br/>2. Sometimes you have to forget the rules, stop being a bureaucrat, and think about the people and the lives you touch. Victor knows this. And we can learn something from him.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is the new Jimmie Stewart. He is literally ""everyman."" As an actor, he conveys more emotion in a foreign language than most actors with a full vocabulary and a convincing script. Of course, he has done this before. In CastAway he doesn't even speak for most of the film. But he conveys every conceivable emotion, every conceivable thought, all non-verbally. He is one of the most gifted actors you will see. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is not particularly well known for making films like ""The Terminal."" There's no eye popping special effects. There's no ghosts, no sharks, no evil forces. It's basically Tom Hanks and the ""interminal"" waiting we all do. Not typical, but very well done."

"BrianDanaCamp","Null","2","4","13 June 2004"," FORREST GUMP II: A rich man's fantasy
","THE TERMINAL is something of a metaphor for Hollywood and how people in its top ranks view the rest of the world. Everyone fawns on the white movie stars (Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones, in this case) and the terminal's black, Latino and ethnic working people all serve their every need--not for pay, but out of the goodness of their hearts. It's like a Disney movie where all the animals of the forest stop behaving like animals and decide to join together to tend to the needs of Snow White for no other reason except that she's...the star! There's even a scene where all the workers in the terminal run from their work stations to flock around Hanks and shower gifts on him. Sure, Hanks' character distributes a little largesse now and then, in the form of a favor or two to a couple of the workers, but the quid greatly outbalances the quo. Hanks' character even crafts an elaborate work of art in the terminal--without any interference from airport or construction personnel. So Spielberg has transposed his ideal world (being taken care of and made comfortable without having to pay for the privilege; no front office interference in the creation of one's art; ""regular"" people helping him court the girl; no emotional lows--only artificially inflated highs; and everyone loving him) onto a supposedly real world setting.<br/><br/>
As a result, there is not a single believable human being to be found in this blatantly condescending racial fantasy. Which is too bad because there's at least one interesting character in Gupta, the senior citizen from India who mops the terminal floors, played by an engaging actor (Kumar Pallana) whose performance transcends his director's utter lack of interest in the actual behavior, motivations and nuances of real working people. And there's a very clever and inspired plot twist, revealed late in the film, which belonged in a different, better movie.<br/><br/>However, if, on the other hand, you buy into our prevailing celebrity culture and you constantly crave false ""uplift"" in your entertainment, then THE TERMINAL is for you."

","Life is all about waiting<br/><br/>The main theme of The Terminal revolves around the concept that life is full of moments of waiting, and this is illustrated by creating the story at the terminal. The terminal is more than just a location of the story. It serves as the design principle because it symbolizes the waiting phase of our lives before we arrive at a new destination. Therefore, all the characters created in the terminal are also in this waiting phase of their lives. Viktor is waiting for the end of the civil war in his country, while Amelia is waiting for her lover's phone call. Waiting does not discriminate.<br/><br/>Xenophobia in USA<br/><br/>An important sub-theme being illustrated in The Terminal is xenophobia in USA. The purpose of demonstrating this concept is easy to understand because The Terminal is written after the 9/11 terrorist attack, therefore it still reflects the fear that are instilled in many Americans. In an attempt to eliminate xenophobia, The Terminal utilizes both positive and negative examples to demonstrate the importance of love and compassion to foreigners. For instance, a positive example is how Viktor successfully befriends with other Americans despite his identity as a foreigner, eventually helping others, such as playing the matchmaker for Enrique and Dolores. On the other hand, a negative example is how Milodragovich is being mistreated by Dixon upon his arrival at the airport. In fact, it is explicitly stated when Salchak criticizes Dixon for his heartless behavior, ""The people, compassion. That's the foundation of this country."" Together, these examples show the prevalence of xenophobia in USA and the importance of eradicating it to solidify the foundation of any country.<br/><br/>Napoleon & Joséphine at the JFK airport<br/><br/>The love story between Napoleon and Joséphine is used as the backbone to describe the relationship between Viktor and Amelia. Specifically, Viktor sees himself as Napoloen, while Amelia sees herself as Joséphine. Therefore, it is not a coincident that Viktor and Amelia also share similar traits as Napoloen and Joséphine respectively. Similar to Joséphine, Amelia enjoys her engagement in adultery, while Viktor's one-sided devotion to Amelia is comparable to Napoloen's.<br/><br/>Apart from this, the dysfunctional love relationship between Napoloen and Joséphine also foreshadows the doomed ending of Viktor and Amelia's relationship. Near the end of the story, Amelia terminates her relationship with Viktor by making a reference to the gold locket inscribed with the word ""destiny"" that Napoloen gave to Joséphine during their wedding. This can be interpreted based on Heraclitus's quote, ""Character is destiny"", meaning that Amelia still accepts her own character at the end. In other words, she still enjoys in engaging adultery, which defines both her destiny and the impossibility of Viktor's engagement in her personal life. This interpretation is reasonable because we, as audience, know that Amelia is perfectly aware of her own contradiction, which is both her enjoyment and dissatisfaction in engaging adultery. However, she still indulges herself in these affairs for many years. Even when Viktor tells Amelia that she is farsighted, which literally means she is farsighted, but also implies that she is poor at judging the men who are near her, Amelia still deliberately chooses not to correct her vision, as she says, ""I always see men the way I want to see them"". Based on these examples, it can be inferred that Amelia decides to embrace her character, and therefore her own destiny at the end."

","The Terminal is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks as a man trapped in a Terminal. The story is quite unique and Spielberg definitely knows when there's a unique story around and he takes a piece of the action. Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) goes to a terminal to catch a flight to New York, but his country is denied, being told by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) that his country doesn't exist anymore because of the big war going on in their country. Victor doesn't really understand English, but learns it by purchasing and borrowing books from stores, his character is so hilarious and lovable that it makes the film all that much better.<br/><br/>We get introduced to other interesting characters like Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana), Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna) who takes interest in Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana) and Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is interested in Victor Navorski, but has a lover. Victor is stuck in this terminal for a total of nine months, Dixon trying to make him escape just for him to get caught by security guards (Victor doesn't fall or it). Hanks then smartly figures out a way to get quarters to pay for Burger King so he can eat quality food, however Frank ends up making restrictions so only the guards can do it.<br/><br/>Hanks' character ends up getting a painting job and takes Warren on a small date, they both throw their beepers into a nearby lake. After nine months, Victor has been hiding the reason he wants to come to New York, he tells Amelia that his father who passed away, had a wish for his son to get all three (or four) signatures from Sax members and the last one is Benny Golson. The guards end up letting Navorski pass, meaning that he ends up going to get the last signature.<br/><br/>It's a happy movie with a unique task that only Spielberg could master. Grade: A+"

"tonypeacock-1","6","0","0","30 April 2020"," Interesting bit of comedy drama from Spielberg
","Director Steven Spielberg collaborates with actor Tom Hanks in this comedy drama from 2004.<br/><br/>Hanks plays Eastern European Viktor Navorski a resident of the fictional state of Krakhozia. Navorski is refused entry to New York when his homeland undergoes a military coup/war during his flight to the U.S. His passport is therefore not valid and the head of the border police orders him to stay in the International Departure Lounge of the airport!<br/><br/>Armed with broken English, a few food vouchers and a pager in case he is needed by the authorities Navorski makes the lounge his home for months whilst the war is still raging. Along the way we meet a few other characters who regularly work in the terminal.<br/><br/>A side story has Catherine Zeta-Jones appearing as a United Airlines hostess who Viktor develops a relationship with. I found some of these scenes distracted from the main story and were just included in the film to allow the casting of Zeta-Jones.<br/><br/>Hanks is an actor I've never particularly endeared to but he plays Viktor well. I was a bit uncomfortable with the border authorities attitude towards someone with little to no English vocabulary skills! Apparently the story is inspired by the story of an Iranian refugee stuck in Paris Charles De Gaulle for years! I couldn't think of any worse situation. I hate airports at the best of time. They are just shopping malls!<br/><br/>Spielberg is not particularly known for his comedy is he? In this film there are several perhaps inadvertent comedic moments such as Viktor looking into security cameras and pulling faces or staff playing cards for items of lost and found items! The film is pretty unique in my opinion. I've not seen a film like it before or since it's release in 2004. Interesting."

"jaredpahl","9","0","0","10 April 2020"," The Art of Sincerity, Craft, and Optimism. The Terminal is a Delightful Grown-Up Crowdpleaser.
","Around film buff circles, the question of the best filmmakers alive seems to invariably lead to names like Nolan, Scorsese, Fincher. My answer is the same it's been since I was 8 years old. The ""corny"", ""obvious"", ""uncultured"" pick; Steven Spielberg. When I posit Steven Spielberg as the greatest living director, there are plenty of films I could use for example. Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, E.T. But the one film I would choose for my thesis is 2004's The Terminal. Why does Spielberg's frothiest comedy prove him as the greatest filmmaker working? Because it illuminates pure directorial talent. When the subject is as inherently powerful as the horrors of warfare or the tolls of human suffering, you may not notice the quality of movie direction. If you really want to see why Spielberg is uncommonly skilled, you have to strip away the extra storytelling weapons. Take the mundanity of, say, an airport terminal, and watch how he makes it appear so magical, sparkling, and alive.<br/><br/>The Terminal stars Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, a common traveler from the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia, who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. The place happens to be New York's JFK airport. The time? Smack dab in the middle of his country's civil war. Krakozhia is no longer, and little does Navorski know, he's legally trapped in the airport until the war ends. It's hard to describe the elevator pitch for The Terminal. It is based partially on a real life figure, but Spielberg takes the bones of that story to indulge in a Carpra-esque Hollywood entertainer. The Terminal is a lot of things, all of them delightful: a fish-out-of-water comedy, a crowd-pleasing romance, and a tear-jerking character piece. The dramatic pull of the film takes shape, we realize, in the form of Viktor Navorski's mission to get the autograph of a famous New York jazz musician. But that's not exactly what the movie is about.<br/><br/>The story serves as an outlet for a collection of aforementioned fish-out-of-water scenes. Now would be a good time to highlight Hanks, who contributes heartily to the value of these scenes. Considering his talent as a dramatic actor, we tend to forget that he is one of the very best light comedians. Here he gets to go full Hanks ahead on the comedy. With his endearingly dorky Eastern European accent, Hanks delivers a winning one-man-show performance, pitched at just the right angle for the tone Spielberg is working with. Tom Hanks is someone who knows how to play broad without sacrificing sweetness.<br/><br/>But more impressive than Hanks, or any of the other great supporting performances (Catherine Zeta-Jones reminds one of the classy Hollywood starlets of the 40s and 50s, and Stanley Tucci is an endlessly watchable baddie.) is Steven Spielberg's direction. He had an entire airport terminal set built specifically for this movie, and the way he populates, stages, and moves his camera around it, is deceptively virtuosic. Because again, nothing incredibly special happens within the terminal's confines. No more than a series of routines that we see through the puppy dog eyes of Hanks' character. And yet, every moment of The Terminal is invigorating. It's just light entertainment, but the way Spielberg carries us through it visually, it feels life-giving. There are shots here, of tiles on a bathroom wall, of tv monitors, or common bookstore facades that are as exciting as anything in Blade Runner 2049, Interstellar, or any other ""most beautiful movie ever"". There is a sequence where Navorski figures out how to acquire change to buy fast food, and it's electrifying. Others can try, but no one else can make that claim. Steven Spielberg could literally direct Hanks making a sandwich and I would be on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The film is quite long. It would be unforgivably tedious and indulgent had it been directed by anyone else. But the greatest living director deserves to indulge. I could watch The Terminal for days. In all it's cheesy, earnest glory. It's a real delight. An old-fashioned crowd-pleaser that most people are scared to take a swing at in this century. Maybe that's because no one else has the directorial swagger of Steven Spielberg. Stripped of everything except a couple of great movie stars and a professional comedic screenplay, he shows how invaluable his cinematic instincts are. Airport Burger King has never looked so good.<br/><br/>85/100"

"Offworld_Colony","8","0","0","17 February 2020"," When I first watched this film, close to its release, I was swept up in its negative buzz and remember finding the movie cheesy and boring.
","Recently, for whatever reason I read an article about filmmakers' careers post-9/11, in particular, Steven Spielberg's; And while War of the Worlds is him coming to terms with the trauma of the event, The Terminal is his initial response of international love and unity in a time threatening the opposite from all sides. The international supporting cast of colourful characters is neither too generic and plain nor too stereotypical and cliché, they are the sort of flawed weirdos you find in life, and you learn to love them because they don't actually fit inside a box you've built for them out of your initial prejudices.<br/><br/>Tucci is not a moustache-twirling villain, and even when he's lost, literally outside of the airport work environment, his humanity shines through. He's a fascinating relatable sort of figure, his self-interest is frighteningly accurate to those times when you've (had to) value career or workplace rules over the human element, you feel sorry for his inability to relate to Viktor due to his career requirements. And the film ensures it elegantly explains the rules and logic as to why Viktor can't leave and clearly outlines the motivations of Tucci's 'villain' character.<br/><br/>Zeta Jones, initially out of place, actually seems to be channelling the screwball comedy elements of the script. And even though Hanks' performance is close to Eastern-European-Face, it's earnest and layered and it feels nothing like the actor we usually see. He portrays a bumbling charming oaf who is also a skilled creator and a romantic, he has hidden layers and complexities shown to those who have the time, or have the foresight to ask him.<br/><br/>The set and extra work should be applauded for its background realism, it's a real piece of art to make it feel natural. So set in this fake place, The Terminal is a fake story about possibly a fake man, but it's 100% real in its sentiment. Even the fact that it's set in an airport so close to 9/11 screams that Spielberg wants to tell you it's ok to see humanity in these places so soon after. It's a film about prejudice and misunderstanding, about how silly borders and checkpoints and glass doors and forms and rules can be and how much they separate us, it's about how similar we all are in essence, and moreover it's about love. The world needs more of these kind of movies, sadly, now more than ever."

","I can't figure it out. Pretty much, we're just dealing with a man who is literally trapped at an airport terminal. He can't go back, he can't leave, and he can't stay at the terminal, either. What's a man to do? You would think for a 2 hour movie that this would be long and boring, right? It's not! I don't know how, but this movie kept my full attention for some reason. Perhaps it was Tom Hanks mind blowing performance. I don't know, all I know it was unbelievable how good this movie was. It's serious on the surface, but deep inside, this is almost a comical approach in the ""what iffy"" zone. I loved Hanks strange accent, he nailed this role perfectly. And Speilberg? I have to hand it to you, I don't like you, but you know how to direct a movie. The pacing is brilliant, the reactions are realistic, and altogether, I just thought this was a great movie.

"josephrygaard","7","0","0","2 December 2019"," Before Watching: The Terminal (2004)
","""The Terminal"" (2004) is a well-rounded and entertaining movie about getting stranded on an airport (and a few things more). If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>The Terminal is as said above about a man who, thanks to peculiar circumstances, finds himself stuck in the JFK airport. Even though the premise doesn't wear an aura of joy and happiness, this movie still manages to create one, much thanks to Tom Hanks great acting and the ingenuity and character of his role. Some supporting side characters also contribute greatly to this, to in the end produce an original and captivating piece of lighthearted (and sometimes poignant) fun.<br/><br/>The only major flaw that can be perceived lies within the antagonist, the stern and cold-hearted airport supervisor. A lot of decisions taken feels extremely unwarranted, and even though they are to some degree necessary to push the narrative forward, can ultimately feel very uncalled for or scripted. This doesn't detract enormously, but it still something that could be relevant for few. All in all, The Terminal is well-paced, entertaining and most definitely a charmingly watch.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a simply great 7/10.

","On his way to New York City to resolve a personal matter, ""Viktor Navorski"" (Tom Hanks) becomes victimized by a civil war in his home country which leaves him in a curious situation. In essence, since his government no longer exists his passport and visa are no longer valid. That means that he cannot go back and he cannot enter the United States. So with no other options the temporary head of Homeland Security at JFK Airport ""Frank Dixon"" (Stanley Tucci) decides to detain him for the time-being in the international terminal there. Unfortunately, as the civil war drags on with no clear resolution, Viktor is left homeless for weeks on end with only a couple of employees there as friends. Yet despite all of this he remains resolute in his determination to finish what he set out to initially accomplish. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an especially cute and endearing film which captured my attention from start-to-finish. Admittedly, there were a few slow parts here and there but they were definitely made up for by the frequent comedy, romance and drama scenes which flowed all around. On that note, while Tom Hanks was quite impressive, I also liked the performance of Kumar Pallana (as ""Gupta Rajan"") who I thought was absolutely hilarious.

","A wonderful story about a man (Hanks) that is detained at A New York City airport. Due to unique circumstances he is unable to enter the US and or go home. He then spends the better part of a year living in the airport. He learns English, makes friends, finds love, and becomes more than just another face at the airport. A wonderful supporting cast spearheaded by Stanley Tucci, gives this Spielberg movie the depth it needs. Remember to get to the airport early and don't miss this one."

","I love Tom Hanks. I know it's a cliched thing to say, but Tom Hanks is the greatest person who is currently alive. And this film really cemented my love for him. <br/><br/>I honestly think that without Tom Hanks I would have hated this movie. It's a stupid, stupid idea. It makes no sense and is really contrived. BUT (and this is the biggest 'but' of all time) it works because Tom Hanks is so unbelievably charming.<br/><br/>He owns this role, after a while you almost forget that this is Tom Hanks just wandering around an airport for two hours. And it's important to remember that this is just Tom Hanks walking around an airport for two hours, BUT IT WORKS SO WELL.<br/><br/>And because Tom Hanks is so great, you really connect with the other characters and feel the emotional weight of all the scenes. You want these people to achieve their goals, even if they are incredibly stupid.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci serves as a great comedic antagonist. He's the villain you love to hate and he adds so much character to what could have easily been a one-note villain.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for a fun, heartwarming movie, then I couldn't recommend this enough."

","THE TERMINAL is an example of Steven Spielberg at his most average as a filmmaker. This is a massive-budgeted production that features Tom Hanks delivering a typically pitch perfect performance as a likeable immigrant stuck at an airport, of all places, and yet compared to Spielberg's best work this is insignificant and ultimately hollow. There are a lot of light laughs en route to the climax, and some well judged supporting roles, but THE TERMINAL also has some serious flaws. A wooden Catherine Zeta-Jones as the shoehorned-in love interest is one of them, and Stanley Tucci's antagonist couldn't get any more bland if he tried. My advice is to watch this if you're a Hanks fan, but otherwise skip it."

","Directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, ""The Terminal"" is a drama and a romantic-comedy. After reading the summary, you may get the feeling that this is another classic film of these genres, but it is not. There is a perfect balance among the genres of the film, as well as its characters and their feelings. ""The Terminal"" is the story of Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) who is coming to New York to fulfill his father's wish. While he was on the air, his country has fallen in a coup and his passport and visa are not recognized by the American Government. Therefore, he is not permitted to go back to his country or enter in United States. His only place to live is the terminal.<br/><br/>Viktor Navorski evolves into a natural hero during the film. The more you watch him, the more you believe in him because he doesn't pretend to be someone else. He is natural and law-obeying person. He has a strong personality and a character. When he comes to USA he doesn't know any English, and, therefore, he fails to understand why he is not permitted in the country or why he can't go back. He is an ambitious guy who starts learning English day by day. Tom Hanks, as Victor Navorski, doesn't try to speak perfect English as the film progresses. He keeps talking with his accent until the end. This makes us believe in film's naturalness, and this little detail creates perfection for ""The Terminal.""<br/><br/>The collaboration of Hanks and Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" brings experience to ""The Terminal."" You get the feeling that they really understand each other while watching the film. Steven Spielberg wants to introduce Navorski as a natural character, and Tom Hanks is there to do it. Confusion in his eyes and his accent are the key points of Tom Hank's performance as Navorski. ""The Terminal"" is a character based film. Its success and perception are strictly based on the performance of the leading actor. That's why their experience with each other is critical. In many scenes, you understand what is going on just by looking at the face of Victor Navorski. The other characters, even the main officer of the airport Frank Dixson (Stanley Tucci) who wants to get rid of him, is not a bad character. Everyone has some certain respect for each other. The film doesn't try to be funny, it just happens by itself. That's why Terminal is a self-flowing, natural film.<br/><br/>The story is said to be inspired by 18-year stay of Mehran Karimi in Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, but still, ""The Terminal"" is an original story. It doesn't have a plot. It is just telling the story of an unlucky man and his determination. There is a huge difference between the first and the last scenes in the means of character development. He comes to the airport as an unknown stranger and turns out to be a hero with his strong state of mind and for being the middle man in the love story between Enrique (Diego Luna) who is responsible for the delivery of the food, and the visa officer Dolores (Zoe Saldana). He also helps a man who is not allowed to take medicine to his father in Russia. These incidents are there for the picking by Navorski on his way to being a hero.<br/><br/>Its natural flow is the strongest point of the film. You feel like an ordinary passenger in an airport, watching everything with your own eyes. The only difference is the man who is stuck there. It is amazing to see the adaptation of human nature to even the most unrealistic circumstances. Even though it is not critically acclaimed, ""The Terminal"" is still a well-made film that is aware of its place. It takes its time for digesting everything. You feel the easiness of the scenes almost all the time. Even though the story takes place in an airport, it doesn't share its speed or agitation. Once I have stayed for 8 hours in an airport and I know what it means to be stuck in a place which has very limited services.<br/><br/>The cinema is going towards a full digitalization. We get to see a lot of special effects and less talent each year. There is an opposite setup in ""The Terminal."" As I said, it is purely based on characters, also most of the film was shot in a set. That huge airport is a set constructed by Alex McDowell, Production Designer of the film. The camera has liberty of showing whatever it feels like, because everything in the set is part of the film. With a lot of wide angles, it shows the reality of an airport. This is very important for the credibility. Janusz Kaminski creates a real environment with his camera."
"Ron_Solina","7","0","0","28 April 2018"," A very much needed schmaltzy excursion.
","When somebody says they're a visiting tourist upon arrival in an airport, is there ever really need for them to explain their itinerary to a complete stranger?<br/><br/>As long as they don't have any bombs strapped on them or they're not gonna unleash a deadly virus or don't plan to do mass killings, smuggle drugs, commit unspeakable horrors etc. in the destination country, why bother stating their reasons for visiting? Unless they are a market research company trying to survey the traveler, people will gladly accommodate that. There are people who don't want to hold up the queue, and there are some things that cannot be explained in a short paragraph (including my simple APPROVAL for this film), and not to mention the variations in people's communication skills. As long those visitors are willing to return home, it's none of people's biscuits whatever they do there that's conforms to whatever in the tourist destination is acceptable and LEGAL. Or people could just easily lie and say they're going to whatever is that country's equivalent of a Disney World.<br/><br/>Mr. Speilberg and Mr. Hanks in the early-noughties have reached the point in their careers where they have already acquired artistic gravitas. For Mr. Hanks, having escaped being typecast as a actor doing just light and screwball comedic roles, and Mr. Spielberg for breaking away from just being labeled as a giga-blockbuster sell-out film director (not that there is anything wrong with that). Given it is the time in history where the US has just been involved in a full-blown war in the Middle East, not to mention, post-9/11 era, for them to collab in a cutesy but sappy drama/comedy involving a creepy old-ish-man-child-ish (perhaps just naive) having the exuberance of 12-year-old discovering unfamilar things for him for the first time, the audience would still be beholden to their effort, a much-needed optimistic escapist fare. <br/><br/>But as far as Mr. Hanks is concerned, I hope this is the last of such comedic roles for him (Unless he would find it an acting challenge to up the ante in the cringe-inducing comedic schtick department, I would definitely not go check that one if ever that should happen). His take on the bumbling erudite prof wannabe crook in Coen Bros' laugh-out-loud The Ladykillers remake is him having a more matured comedic persona, and the one I kind of enjoy and prefer.<br/><br/>And for Mr. Spielberg, it's obvious that this film could have been passed over to a less-experienced director but chose to do it himself perhaps as contribution to his country during the trying times, a gift to his fans all over the world, a straightforward film with absurdist undertones. Even at the risk of sounding like a suck-up, I'd still say that even though the film is based on the experiences of a real-life character who got paid for the rights to use their story, the decision of opting not to use the guy's real name and chosing instead to use a fictitious version of the person facing the same sticky situation showed remarkable prudence on the part of filmmakers.<br/><br/>The airport set used is in the film is just spectacular. Never been into one (yet), but that film kind of raised the bar to what people's expectations of what an airport should look like, I guess. Other actors involved in the film: Tucci, Zeta-Jones, and others were splendid and enjoyable to watch in quite a decent and wholesome sincere film.<br/><br/>--B-flat--"

My rating 9 is solely based on how Hanks has managed to single-handedly engaged the audience throughout. Some other side characters have put in a commendable performance. There are moments in the movie that makes it a memorable watch. <br/><br/>The romantic element in the movie spoils the fun, for me. Unrealistic ending makes it look like a Bollywood masala movie (which has a lot of emotion without making much (or any) sense).

It portrays a scene from many frequent fliers life where you are delayed for hours and you have nothing to do! In Victor's case, it is not hours but days and maybe even months. So, he figures out the ""little things"" in the airport! He was genuine and honest (except for the ""goat"" part) and funny all throughout.

"davispittman","9","0","0","16 February 2018"," A classic in my book
","The Terminal is a classic film, a very unique one. I say that it is unique because I truly can't think of a another film like it. The plot revolves around Tom Hanks's character, a foreign man traveling from a country that is in ruins and now he cannot go back to his country because it no longer exists, but the airport can't let him go into America either, so he has no choice but to stay in the terminal. Stanley Tucci plays the man working at the airport who is basically in charge. He quickly becomes the antagonist in the film, and he plays that role well, Tucci has flexed his acting muscle in other great movies such as Devil wears prada, Julie and Julia, and more, and this one is no exception. Hanks ofcourse shines in the lead role, as he always does, I remember being amazed at the accent and how great he nails it, I also love how he portrayed Victor, his character. Hanks plays Victor with a lovability that's just undeniable. That lovability is crucial for this character, it must be expressed through him in order for the entire film to work in the way it's supposed to be. Then there's Catherine Zeta Jones. I absolutely love her and her character in this film. She plays a fight attendant that frequently comes to the airport that Victor is at, and he develops feelings for her. They have great chemistry together and I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen when they are together. Theirs isn't a grand epic love story, but it's a very sweet endearing one, and it works perfectly for the movie. The writing really is great and I love it has some comedy and sweet, touching moments. It's very balanced, and it makes for a great film."

I explained to him this is based on a trued story of Merhan Nasseri who lived in Frances main airport for 18 years which in itself is remarkable. I've seen a few negative reviews on this movie and personally I don't see why. <br/><br/>They made the movie their own and in a comedic style and for me they pulled it off, yes of course you have to suspend belief with the likes of Zeta Jones who looks stunning in this falling for Viktor (Hanks) I mean would Zeta Jones fall for a much older guy in real life.....oh wait<br/><br/>Hers is a tragic character and I dare say there is some woman who are like that, keep falling for the wrong guy and keep going back for more.
The other sad character was played by Diego Luna stalking, yes lets be fair stalking Zoe Saldana and getting Viktor to get info from her then eventually presenting her with a ring. She still had no idea who was interested in her c'mon this is really where you have to suspend belief.<br/><br/>Give this movie a go it's up there with ""Catch me if you can"" another Spielberg/Hanks movie as an easy watch that is quite charming and sweeps you up."

"HotToastyRag","7","0","0","28 December 2017"," A few laughs, but not really a feel-good flick
","The preview of The Terminal is a pretty good representation of the film, which isn't always the case with modern trailers. Tom Hanks plays a man from Krakozhia, visiting the United States for the first time. He arrives in New York City, but before he gets through immigration he runs into a pretty major problem. Stanley Tucci, the customs director, informs him that his government is going through a crisis and he isn't allowed to enter the United States. He's also not allowed to be shipped home, so he's stuck in ""the terminal"" until his country stabilizes. He meets a host of airport workers who have a host of quirky traits, and he also becomes attracted to stewardess Catherine Zeta-Jones. And, as you can see from the preview, there are a few laughs, some good acting from an accented and utterly foreign Tom Hanks, some cute scenes, but it won't end up being your favorite movie in the world.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film are the minor characters. Kumar Pallana, a janitor, is extremely irritating. His character is written to have a major attitude problem and to be intentionally mean, for no reason except to exact a frustrated chuckle from the audience. Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana have an awkward romance that isn't the most amusing part of the plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones, while written realistically, isn't a very nice person and reminds audiences of that one person in their circle of friends who makes endless mistakes but is tolerated because of her beauty.<br/><br/>Basically, if you're a Tom Hanks fan, or a Steven Spielberg fan, or a John Williams fan, you'll probably want to see it. But it's not exactly the feel-good movie that you think it will be. There's a big mystery in the plot and once it's revealed, you might feel a bit let down. Having said that, I do own a copy, since there are some cute scenes. My favorite is Tom Hanks's preparation of asking Catherine Zeta-Jones out on a date, or as he says it, to ""eat a bite"". He's a cutie!"

"speedy-droid","8","0","0","24 August 2016"," A Wonderful Character Study
","The Terminal is a wonderful character study, which is something with which Tom Hanks seems to be intrigued... Forrest Gump, Cast Away, The Terminal, Bridge of Spies, etc. He does a very good job with it, for the most part.<br/><br/>First of all... The premise of the film is unlikely. A person in the situation of Hanks' character -- Viktor -- would not be treated/ignored in the manner show in the film, especially post-9/11 (the film was released in 2004). I know -- I work in the travel and transportation industry. However, that is not really relevant to the point(s) that the film appears to be trying to make, so a little suspension of belief in this regard is acceptable.<br/><br/>Just for the Record: In the real world, Viktor would swiftly have been removed from the airport, and probably would have been granted temporary asylum or somehow returned to his home or an intermediary location. At any rate, he wouldn't have been allowed to wander around the airport for weeks or months, when the authorities knew his situation from Day One. In that respect, the film is just a caricature of U.S. bureaucracy. That situation was necessary for the plot, so the filmmakers had to use a little ""artistic license"" to create the situation which they wanted.<br/><br/>So, then we see the Character Study. A foreign national, who doesn't know English, is suddenly trapped in an unusual situation in the USA. He's not an accused criminal, but he's trapped. How would he respond? According to the film, he does so by reverting to his own culture and personal morals. That makes sense. When we feel afraid and isolated, we almost always revert to our basic instincts and base culture. It helps us to feel safe and comfortable.<br/><br/>Viktor does that. He looks for ways to sustain himself, he helps other people as he was (probably) taught to do as a child.<br/><br/>The only real issue that I had with the film was the somewhat manufactured relationship between Viktor and Amelia (Catherine Zeta- Jones). That seemed to be a bit non-sequitur.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film that explores humanity and emotion very well."

","Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a citizen of Krakozhia, an obscure non-existent Eastern European country, who arrives at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in order to visit New York City. Unfortunately his country has experienced a revolution while his plane was in the air and has promptly revoked all travelling licenses. Including Navorki's. So, they cannot allow him to enter United States proper, but neither can they send him back, because technically he hasn't been recognized as a citizen of the new Krakozhia. So he has to stay at the airport, indefinitely.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have always been a fantastic team and this just might be my favourite film from the two of them. Spielberg's flair for entertainment and intrigue is in full blast. The airport is riddled with personalities and as most of the film is spent with Navorski simply wandering around and interacting with them, it makes sense that they should be the focus of the film. Well, they are and they work wonderfully. I especially like Stanley Tucci's Frank Dixon, the head of the airport, who gets far more than he bargained for in Viktor and is slowly driven to the brink of insanity because of this one man. The film might also be Catherine Zeta-Jones's finest work.<br/><br/>But it's Tom Hanks's performance that shines the brightest in this film. Sure his pseudo-Slavic accent is hokey, sure it makes no sense that he doesn't just leave the airport and claim asylum, sure there are a whole bunch of other small things that don't really add up. It's not a very realistic film - though it is inspired by real-life events - but rather a film that pulls you into a story, an experience, an adventure. And in the middle of all that is Hanks, living through it with sad eyes and a solemn face, which every now and then lights up with joy and discovery.<br/><br/>If you like Spielberg or Hanks you're going to like this film. If you like them both, you're going to love it."

"bimmergeek","8","0","0","4 May 2005"," Cast Away Redux
","This is a great story that combines humor, drama and romance in parts that are likely to appeal to women wanting a romantic comedy and enough comedy and drama so that a guy wouldn't be embarrassed seeing it with his wife/girlfriend.<br/><br/>In a sense, however, Tom Hanks is revisiting his role in ""Cast Away"" in this movie. The essential premise is the same: A resourceful man is isolated in a context where he is unable to get help from other people. The man must exploit his environment to rise above his circumstances of isolation.<br/><br/>The Terminal, of course, is not exactly identical to Cast Away because of the presence of people. But I think the essential premise of the movies is the same.<br/><br/>Hanks is superlative as the protagonist, who is immediately likable. His authenticity and ingenuity throughout the movie draws you in to care deeply about his plight. While Americans scream and throw tantrums if they are stuck in a terminal for 4 unplanned hours, Victor is in the terminal for 9 months. I found his perseverance, his patience, his humility, his adaptivity and his utter lack of demandingness to be inspiring. Watching Victor adapt to uncontrollable circumstances and insensitive airport personnel reminded me how good life is here and to be thankful for it.<br/><br/>Catherine Zeta Jones is wonderful eye-candy but plays a character who I felt was inconsistent. She is a woman who can only choose poisonous men but is somehow able to respond to Victor with gentleness, intimacy and affection. Her sudden turn fits the initial premise that she can only handle poisonous men, but doesn't fit the tenderness she shows him earlier. And of course, the number of times they meet accidentally is sheer folly.<br/><br/>The movie is shot with strong color themes. There are numerous times when the sets, lighting and scene color are themed with yellow, blue and green. I noticed a dominant green them while Starbucks was the featured product and I noticed a dominant yellow then when Borders was the featured product. If this is intentional, it is an interesting approach to product placement.<br/><br/>Least important to me is the romantic theme but the women might like it. There are two romantic plot lines, both of which are improbable. Hanks and Zeta-Jones and two minor characters who get married after never having actually met one another. Completely absurd romanticism that bears no connection to reality but I guess it gives the ladies something to keep them emotionally connected to the movie.<br/><br/>(Tangent: Why do so many romance movies depend on the random event that leads to true love? Does this reveal that finding love is nothing but sheer luck and that sustaining it is not a function of relationship but chance? Look at all the romantic comedies that are out there and you will see that the random connection is a dominant theme in them. Very odd.] Overall, I found this movie to be well-acted, the lighting and sets were excellent, the cinematography had great clarity and color and the editing was strong too. It is an engaging movie in spite of its plot line flaws.)"

He is not allowed into the US so he is confined to one terminal. One of things that makes this movie unreal is that Hanks can't speak or read English yet the Airport authorities never get an interpreter and talk to him only in English, which is fine for English speaking audiences and doesn't waste time doing translations in the movie but would never happen in real life. The story revolves around his life in the airport terminal and the suspense is whether or not he will ever get out of the terminal and if so, how.<br/><br/>The subplot is his romance with an airline hostess, Catherine Zeta-Jones. Unfortunately, she adds nothing to the movie. Her acting was par for her which is sub-par and she doesn't really fit. While Zeta-Jones is not beautiful she is too glamorous for today's generally homely hostesses, And for an airport which is usually full of hostesses she is the only one that appears.<br/><br/>But despite its flaws, the movie keeps moving and it is entertaining if one ignores its unrealities. The ending though is weird and not particularly satisfying."

","This was a little gem that snuck right up on me. It sounded like a terrible idea for a storyline and Tom Hanks has been in some bad movies lately even though he's always great in them. However as soon as I started my screening I instantly got sucked in and was eagerly awaiting to see what'd happen next. It was also neat that it was actually loosely based on a person in real life that has lived in an airport in France for a very long time now. I just may have to go visit him someday, well probably not but if I make it too 100 years old it'll be on my to-do list. Then again I doubt he'd still be alive...oh well there goes that plan! Overall it was really an uplifting movie and it had a lot of warm-hearted moments that were perfect for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend! The acting was first rate with only one exception with that being Catherine Zeta-Jones. She sucks! But despite her, everyone else did wonderful and since it had a big cast this more than made up for it. I'm surprised this sunk at the box office, if I knew then what I know now I would've laid off calling it 'a stinker!'. Tom Hanks is absolutely hysterical playing a good-natured foreigner and did a perfect interpretation. I worship this guy as an actor and can't believe how far he has progressed since his early days. Whatever he did, I gotta do!<br/><br/>Final Travel:<br/><br/>Movies: I would've but then again it's one that the big screen wouldn't have heightened the effect of.<br/><br/>DVD Purchase: Multiple viewings would be improbable.<br/><br/>Rental: You'll adore it!!"

Someone pointed out that you can't look away from him, and they're right, the guy just radiates charisma and star power, plus he had the somewhat confused- slightly lost look down perfectly, he's a from a small country, and this is all new to him, of course he's gonna have that ""deer in the headlights"" look at times. His circle of pals are amazing, Chi McBride who NEVER fails to impress is simply brilliant again, and while Diego Luna does nice work, both of them get blasted off the screen by Kumar Pallana in a small, yet scene stealing role. The guy is very funny, yet quite touching. Stanley Tucci plays the jackass by-the-book type, but somehow never generates any sympathy for his character, even though he's caught between a rock and a hard place. The set is amazing, and they captured the whole airport look and feel perfectly. The downs: Who the hell ever told Catherine Zeta Jones she could act? Marrying Micheal Douglas does not mean you should be working. She's sooooo...........shallow, in what could have been a hell of a role for her, Spielberg blew it on putting her in this because she really brings it down whenever she's on screen. Gwynneth Paltrow or Renee Zellweger would have been better, hell, Drew Barrymore could have been more convincing! Bad, talentless actress ruins what could have been a great movie, despite great rest of cast, great director, cinematography, offbeat storyline, had Hanks had someone of skill to work off of, he'd be an Oscar favorite right now, unfortunately, the costar of no discernible skills sinks this one.

","Although I never expect The Terminal, directed by the all-time genius Steven Spielberg, to feature bombastic special effects and create major attraction amongst the audience, this little gem turns out to be surprisingly funny and heart-warming compared to most movies I have seen this year. The plot is slightly more of a parody of Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away: Tom Hanks was once stranded in an unknown island. In The Terminal, he's once again stranded, this time however, in an airport in New York City. <br/><br/>Viktor Navorski (the role that Tom plays) comes to America to accomplish one thing that his father has requested before he died but due to conflicts and government overthrow in Krakozhia, his visa and passport are no longer valid in the US, forcing him to stay put within the terminal. To make matters worse, Navorski's English proves to be a pain in the neck, often causing misinterpretations and confusion. But there lies the brilliance of Tom Hanks: every gesture and expression he made in each scene is naturally flawless and hilarious. As in any Spielberg film, the editing is smooth, the camera angles are creatively used in a rather dynamic way and of course, bits and pieces of clever gags to make sure that the audience don't get bored easily. If some speak of some miscast in this movie, well, that may be half true. Catherine Zeta Jones plays her role nicely, Stanley Tucci fits the role of the 'villain' extremely well and the rest manage to give The Terminal a sense of magic even if it isn't obviously there.<br/><br/>I just only hope if Mr. Spielberg spends more time with the romantic relationship between Tom and Catherine but the rest of the production is plain exceptional. Overall, The Terminal is a perfect choice for lovers out there, including those in the airport."

Well you must also take for granted a few other unlikely things such as that despite the fact that when the main character came into the airport after landing, he practically didn't know a word of English, after a few days he talked passably well and that he managed to change the space of an airport door into a bedroom for him without nobody seeming to notice it for months.

","'Terminal, The' is another encounter between Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. This time, Mr Hanks plays a tourist from western Europe who has to stay inside the airport of New York because his country of origin falls in a cruel Civil War and the government fall under the Revolutionary forces. So, in good International Law Terms, Mr. Viktor Navorski (the parsonage played by Hanks) is a completely 'not wanted' visitor in USA. Many reviews said that this movie is a kind of protest against the American intolerance against other nations of the world after the grievous events of September 11. And that would be the great idea of Spielberg: to make a popular and blockbuster movie that goes against the course of the political moment in USA. Maybe it's true but the force of the message - in this particular case - is not so evident or strong to make 'Terminal, The' a political movie. In fact, the movie resembled sometimes a bit like some Frank Capra classics. A simple-minded story with a simple-minded character involved, against his will, in a difficult and pathetic situation. In this way, Spielberg made a routine movie, with a competent although not brilliant story.<br/><br/>'Terminal, The' has a uneven narrative, with some good moments and some others not so compelling. The support cast gives great moments, especially the old janitor, he too a foreigner who came from India. But the love affair between Vicktor and Amelia, a beautiful steward (played without bright by Zeta-Jones) is far-fetched and just boring. Another problem is the character of Dixon, the Supervisor of the airport, played by Stanley Tucci. Although Tucci is a correct actor, his character is almost unreal in his insensibility and bureaucratic attitudes. 'Terminal, The' in my opinion is far from a masterpiece or even a movie that deserves a special attention. Tom Hanks, maybe the best American actor in activity, made the show like always. Now, he's a castaway imprisoned inside the walls of an international airport. But again he made us fly away with his rare talent."

","The impact of Hanks' brauvura comic performance may be lessened for British viewers by his character's similarities to minor TV star Borat. <br/><br/>That aside, The Terminal is pleasant light entertainment; marred by a disastrous piece of casting in Catherine Zeta-Jones as 'love interest.' Spielberg lights her like a true diva of the screen- her beauty deserves something much more epic than this breezy piece of fluff. Her scenes appear to be taken from a wholly separate project- she is completely out of place in a film otherwise populated almost entirely by quaintly lovable bottom-feeders. The best of these is the irrepresible Gupta.<br/><br/>'Lost In Translation' did dislocation far more believably than this. Spielberg tries to imbue his hero with the innocence and mysticism of Forrest Gump; but is hampered by the confines of the script and location conceit. Unlike Forrest, Victor is not destined to enter the lexicon.<br/><br/>It is a fairy story, which is only tolerable because none of the characters have any resemblance to real people. In this respect it is blissfully escapist. For a film which aims much lower- and achieves infinitely more- I refer again to 'Translation.'"

The director depicts the theme of hell experienced by immigrants searching for the American dream and finding biases, mistrust and arrogance; it does that telling about this man getting by on few words of English (by the way, how could he learn that? It seems strange he can get to order a meal in Mc) and on the sympathy of some strangers who secretly support his struggle against the power. The movie basic idea is innovative and fitting for these times we find ourselves in; nevertheless, the love affair between Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones gets a bit too complicated and the heartbreaking ending too obvious.

","In 'The Terminal' Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), an Eastern European man from the imaginary land of Krakozhia, arrives in New York's JFK International Airport but is not given permission to enter the U.S.<br/><br/>He is informed by the Frank Dixon (Stanly Tucci), the head of the airport, that his country has experienced a coup and that the new government is not recognized by the U.S. so Viktor's visa is no longer valid. Since his visa is invalid Viktor cannot enter the U.S. and because the new government of Krakozhia is not recognized by the U.S., Viktor cannot return to his country. The United States is closed to Viktor so he is only allowed to move about in the airport terminal (hence the title).<br/><br/>Despite having what seems like a boring premise for a movie, the Terminal stays entertaining throughout the film. Viktor is always faced with new problems adjusting to his new life in the airport. For instance, one of the first problems Viktor must overcome is finding food to eat without any American money (his money is worthless now that his country is longer recognized). he comes across a restaurant in the food court where they give away crackers, mustard, and ketchup. Using these materials Viktor creates a sandwich of sandwich compliments to eat. While eating his meager meal, in what seems to be a social commentary on America's wastefulness, Viktor sees people discard half eaten meals, but before he can reach them they are always cleaned up and thrown away by the airport staff as if the airport is meant to starve him.<br/><br/>There are various subplots in this movie that also keep it moving. While it seems almost every character in the movie has some sort of subplot the Viktor becomes involved in, the most notable is a romantic affair between Viktor and a flight stewardess named Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Amelia is a woman who struggles throughout the film with a relationship with an unnamed married man who is having an affair on the side with her. She knows she is being used but accepts it because she has no one else in her life. She meets Viktor while leaving her gate when her heel comes off of her shoe and Viktor innocently helps her retrieve it. They meet various other times in the movie culminating in a date on the roof of the airport, assisted by the airport staff.<br/><br/>This movie also has an antagonist, someone whose sole purpose seems to be to keep Viktor in international limbo. The villain in this film is a man who seems to be the personification of the State Departments bureaucratic red tape, Frank Dixon the aforementioned head of the airport. Frank Dixon is an up and coming State Department employee who has recently landed the job of head of the Airport from his retiring predecessor. At first Frank is intent on getting rid of Viktor, and this leads to some rather humorous moments with camera following Viktor where ever he goes. But after an incident where Viktor lies while translating for a Russian who needs medicine for his father, Frank becomes intent on never letting Viktor into the United States.<br/><br/>Eventually, the revolution in Viktor's country ends and he is allowed to go back to Krakozhia. But Viktor is not going to go back home without doing what he came to New York to do. In this he is assisted by Amelia who is able, through less than respectable ways, to attain a temporary visa into the United States for her friend Viktor. After doing what he came to do Viktor tells the cab driver, who also is an immigrant that he is going home.<br/><br/>This movie is paced very well and is both romantic and funny. There seems to be a repetitive Russian theme to the music. The cinematography cleverly manages to capture the strangeness, and size of an international airport from the eyes of a Krakozhian by spinning the camera around Viktor to show the immensity of the airport terminal. The acting is right on target with both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Hanks totally convincing the audience of their new personas despite having been in so many other well known roles. Overall the movie was excellently directed and I would have expected nothing less from the director that brought us Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, and E.T. the Extra Terrestrial.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie and was never once bored despite what may seem to be a boring premise. This film was excellently directed and well acted. It manages to be romantic and funny while also providing a social commentary on the way America appears to the world.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 stars"

","As crazy as it may sound this really is another movie with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. America's lovebirds come together for this peculiar and amusing, even though a bit light, comedy about a man who's stuck in...you guessed it, the terminal. The premise sounded incredibly good, albeit I forgot to think it all out a bit: how COULD you do this both funny and intelligent? And, furthermore, how did this fit in Spielberg's schedule?<br/><br/>Well, it seems it fit very well. Catherine Zeta, Tom and Steven got around for a few days of filming and put together this nearly satirical comedy. It was just what Spielberg liked: big actors, interesting script and a movie for the whole family. So he lowered his magic wand and made it into another Forrest Gump. The comparison is a bit rough, but you might see a glimpse of Forrest while watching and listening to Viktor Novorski: a naive, a bit clumsy, sincere and good-hearted guy who, due to his lack of certain language skills, leaves the impression of being a bit...behind. Unfortunately his traits fit the profile I was talking about.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes is where I found the best scenes of the film, but do not fear, for scattered throughout the film you shalt find others. Ideologically speaking, I really couldn't add up the parts of this here production: the story of a homeless and unwanted man, the great human spirit within and the less than redeeming love story. It feels strange. The so called love story is the absolute low point: it's distant and shallow, something Mel Brooks might call ""love uninspired"" (talking of which, I ask myself how a guy who could barely speak English, was able to read books about Napoleon which were thousands of pages long). Catherine let me down, because I expected a bit more from her performance, but in the end it's so short that it doesn't even matter. The terrible guy in charge, senor Dixon (Stanley Tucci), is the pain in the buttocks, total opposite of hard working and high spirited Novorski whose sole purpose it is to annoy us.<br/><br/>And what's the basis of the journey, you might ask. It definitely can't be something normal, can it? Well I fear that although it wants to be different, the whole story is short of genuine.<br/><br/>The movie is weak. But! it is fun to watch and relaxing, feel good material. It might be a disappointment coming from Spielberg who, it struck me, gave a strong impression at times that a beam of light can take you from America to Honolulu and back, but it really depends on whether the croissant really does come from Romania or not. I'll have to check this out one happier day. In the meantime, where could one go with the speed of light? 6.5/10"

","Rating: **** (out of *****)<br/><br/>The latest Steven Spielberg film asks the following question: What if you were forced to live in an airport terminal indefinitely, with the eyes of the men in charge, and possibly the rest of the world, upon you?<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a citizen of the fictional country of Krakozhia. Poor Viktor  he only wanted to fly to New York to carry out a brief errand, but all that he has found out is that his country is under siege, leaving him with both a cancelled VISA and the inability to return home. A meeting with JFK Airport chief Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) leads him to realize that he can't enter the United States either, and as a result, he is trapped in the terminal. Living there initially proves a hard slog, especially considering his language difficulties, but in time he finds both friendship and even love from the most unlikely of places.<br/><br/>The Terminal has the inventiveness of Cast Away and the implausibility of Love Actually, with a premise that draws memories of The Truman Show. (Not surprising, really, when you see that The Truman Show's writer, Andrew Niccol, is one of the credited writers.) All these elements, perhaps surprisingly, work in its favour  even though you feel echoes of all the aforementioned films, this film stands on its own to the point where you should enjoy it very much. But you must suspend your disbelief before you enter the cinema. For only on Planet Spielberg do you find airport terminals as attractive and conveniently constructed as this one. Only on Planet Spielberg would you find both a caring and beautiful INS agent (in the form of Zoë Saldana). And only on Planet Spielberg do you see stewardesses who look uncannily like Catherine Zeta Jones.<br/><br/>And then there's the product placement, which is needed to make the setting more realistic (yeah, sure). Sorry Steve, I let you off the hook in Minority Report because at least there you were using the brand names to illustrate invasion of privacy. It doesn't seem like that here. I'm almost certain now that what Minority Report did for the GAP & Lexus, The Terminal will do for Burger King, Starbucks and Hugo Boss.<br/><br/>Spielberg has fallen foul of some critics by casting the all-American everyman, Tom Hanks, as the Russian, sorry, Krakozhian immigrant. But I bought Hanks as Navorski. There's nothing exaggerated or unsubtle about Viktor's mannerisms. No overreacting, no melodrama, just a restrained portrayal (with a plausible accent). The comparisons to Forrest Gump have been floating around, but they shouldn't be  Viktor's innocence comes not from what he is, but the land he is in.<br/><br/>Even though all of the other characters seem like they would only exist in a fantasy (and that is, after all, what The Terminal is) the actors playing them invest them with the right amount of believability. For example, even though Stanley Tucci's character is unfortunately overwritten, Tucci plays him with enough restraint that he is credible. What puzzles me, though, is how Catherine Zeta Jones can remain such a mystery; so irritating off screen, yet rather charming on screen. <br/><br/>The Terminal succeeds better than Love Actually because Spielberg doesn't try too hard to give all the characters equal screen time. This isn't an ensemble piece, and although we see enough of the supporting cast, the focus is always on Viktor Navorski. Yeah, the film is predictable. It's sometimes really corny, and Spielberg, as with his last two films, doesn't really know when to end the film. Yet in general, it leaves you with an unmistakable smile on your face throughout  and really, what more could you ask for?"

Spielberg comes through as director as well. How do you make filming inside an airport terminal interesting? Spielberg manages to do just that. But all of this would not matter if there was no story or characters to base it on. And without providing spoilers, lets just say Tom Hanks once again pulls off a film sustaining role. It helps that he is given a quality script to work with. Add to all of the above an unexpected group of protagonists, and antagonist and a little romance, and what more could one ask for from a night out at the movies. My only qualm is that ""The Terminal"" is over sentimental at times. And of course, it is a drama - no action here. A fine film nevertheless.  8/10"

","I love quirky. I love recklessly absurd. With Hollywood becoming just another megamillion dollar McIndustry that insists on playing things obscenely safe, I am especially happy to see anything new and inventive come out of there. So, it's a bit sad when this one tries and fails to do something rather grandiose and different. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a master director. He may not always be my cup of tea, but he's a pillar and definer of the craft. Whatever other faults might be there, his work will be consistently high-quality - at least, that's what I would have said before this film. Almost all of it is up to his high standard - The cinematography and style of the film, the individual performances, the imagination put into the plot are all wonderful. There are two major flaws, though, that make the whole thing a rather jarring experience.<br/><br/>First, the script is poor. There are holes big enough to taxi a plane through. There are moments where all sense of characterization is put on hold, so that an individual can say something ""witty"", or ""funny"", or soundbite-like for the commercials... if the commercials ever show any of the dialogue. It's much easier to forgive the absurd moments that follow from the absurd premise - where they risk big and it doesn't necessarily pay off big - than it is to forgive the other kind of flaws in the writing: it's just plain mediocre, amongst occasional flashes of above-average. Adorning this script with Janusz Kaminski's photography is like using Michelangelo to illustrate a Chia Pet commercial. ""Subpar"" standing next to ""sublime"" is just sad.<br/><br/>The second flaw is that, while Hanks does a great job and Zeta-Jones does a good one, they appear to be acting in different movies. His is a meaty, moody, compassionate portrait. Hers is a perky, light, appealing one. He's Robert Deniro, she's Doris Day. Instead of melding the two different characters in some fashion, Spielberg seems happy to let them skate by one another, acting in wildly different styles. While I enjoyed both performances (Zeta-Jones making do with the slim pickins her character gets), I couldn't enjoy them together. Stanley Tucci also has a significant role - his character, though, suffers from the writing more than the rest, and he is relegated to what is supposed to be a funny villain, but is instead just a confusing, angry man.<br/><br/>Considering what's out there, this one's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours - especially if your only other option is Garfield.

","*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind Buy <br/><br/>""The Terminal"" is the third collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks. It tells the story of Viktor Navorski, an immigrant from the fictional country of Krakozhia. Upon arriving at JFK airport in New York City he finds himself in a bit of a pickle. Before his plane landed, there was a military coup in his country that resulted in a change of government. This makes his passport void and forces him to wait in the airport until the situation gets sorted out. The premise sounds far fetched and the fact that the idea came from an actual man's experience of having to live in an airport was interesting. <br/><br/>I loved this movie. When the tv spots for the film exclaimed that Tom Hanks' performance was his ""best since Forrest Gump"" it was not lying. Hanks was incredible in his role and easily made us love the character. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Amelia Warren, the flight attendant that Viktor falls in love with. She has trouble with relationships and fails to find the right men; enter Viktor. Stanley Tucci is the antagonist of the film. He is Frank Dixon whose constant attempts to release Viktor to New York City backfire in rather comical fashions. He is a great character and Tucci's performance gives us another reason to root for Viktor. <br/><br/>This would be a five star film in my mind if the ending didn't leave me with the thought of, ""that's it?"" Perhaps I am too brainwashed by Hollywood but this film had a semi-unconventional ending. The ending was not formulaic like many other romantic comedies and still left me satisfied but not to the extent that I thought the film merited. Maybe it is just me but I was just a little disappointed with one minor event in the third act. Overall, close to everything in the film is perfect. I would love to give ""The Terminal"" ***** and I would if it weren't for my initial reaction to the ending. So I feel I have to give this fantastic romantic comedy a ****1/2 rating, and I am not too big a fan of romantic comedies."

","This is loosely based on a real event and it makes for a fascinating story but even though I do recommend this film there are several things that just don't work. Story takes place at the JFK Airport in New York City where Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has his passport taken away after his country Krakozhia is involved in a civil war and the United States fails to recognize it. This means that Viktor is allowed to stay in the terminal until things get better in his country but he is not allowed to set foot outside the terminal doors. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is the new security chief and doesn't know what to do with him and slowly he gets irritated by Viktor's dilemma. Viktor roams the terminal and gets to know everyone that work in all the businesses and meets a stewardess named Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is dating a married man.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Viktor helps a baggage handler romance INS Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) and becomes friendly with the head janitor Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana). He also starts a flirtatious relationship with Amelia until she finds out what his real situation is and she becomes disenchanted by men in general. Frank keeps asking people what is in the peanut can that Viktor carries with him and eventually it is learned that he is trying to get the autograph of jazz artist Benny Golson.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg can be both praised and blamed for this film and it does possess both the best and worst of his talents. The cinematography is by the great Janusz Kaminski who not only supplies the shots of the terminal but makes the audience believe that this is actually someone's home, which it has become. Spielberg had the set of the terminal built on a sound stage by Alex McDowell and it's one of the most impressive things about the film. Hanks while not completely believable does give a good performance and even when he doesn't do much in a scene you can't take your eyes off of him. If that's not star power than I don't know what is! The best thing about this film is watching how Hanks character manages to survive living in a terminal and this part of the story is fascinating to watch. Also, there is a very good performance by Pallana as the janitor who makes the best of a rather small and quiet role. But there are several things that just don't work in this film and one is the so-called romance with Zeta-Jones who in reality would not give Viktor a second look. Also, the romance with the baggage handler and Saldana is completely unbelievable and are we really suppose to buy the fact that a hot chick like Saldana would be a Trekkie? And then they get married in the terminal? The script lays the sentiment on pretty thick as we learn about Viktor's peanut can and that he's in America for his dead father. Tucci's character could have been a much more interesting but the script just wants him to add the adversity for the film. The film ends with no emotional payoff but I still do recommend this effort by one of the great filmmakers in history and starring one our finest actors. It could have been a much more fascinating film but what we do get is more than enough."

","Warning! Spoilers contained within.<br/><br/>This film is a Spielberg entertainment-machine of a movie. It's smart and clever with more product' placements than anything since ""Minority Report"", which ironically warned of the intrusion of advertising in our lives. The Indian actor Kumar Pallana playing the janitor, who once appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"", is the funniest thing in the movie. His juggling tricks during the formal dinner are hilarious.<br/><br/>This film has a weak first half. It is all Tom Hanks with themes similar to his 2000 release ""Castaway"". With this film he is a stranded in an airline terminal instead of an island, bonds with a can of Planters Peanuts instead of a soccer ball, and deliveries an autograph instead of a Fed Ex package. There are several bits in the movie which are way too contrived: the carpentry miracles Hanks performs and the photocopies of his handprints among others. Hanks is good as the foreigner without a country and Spielberg is such an accomplished filmmaker that they come through with another entertaining film. This is not a great film, but it makes for a reasonably enjoyable two hours."
"BradBate","Null","0","0","2 July 2004"," Steven Spielberg channels Frank Capra and Tom Hanks creates another character you will always love.
","I laughed. I cried. I felt my heart ache with pain and jump for joy. And I had a very real sense that in time, this 'serious comedy' from director Steven Spielberg and everyman actor Tom Hanks will be viewed as an American classic. No, it is not seamless. Yes, it is a stretch. Without question it is sweet and charming on a level that will put some people in a diabetic coma. But most folks will find it true and real and utterly wonderful. <br/><br/>Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is common man on a heart-felt personal mission. He has arrived in New York's Kennedy International Airport from his home in Eastern Europe full of purpose and excitement. But his timing couldn't be worse. While he has been in transit, war has broken out in his beloved Krakozhia; rebels have toppled the government. And even though he is thousands of miles away, Viktor is caught in the conflict. His passport is from a government that no longer exists; his visa is invalid; he cannot enter the United States, nor can he return home. Both he and ambitious international terminal security officer Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) are flummoxed by the snarled protocols and labyrinth bureaucracy that they now face, so Viktor takes up residence in the terminal itself while things are being worked out. Days turn into weeks and weeks into months as the good-hearted Krakozhian finds ways to make money, learn English, befriend the JFK staff and fall in love.<br/><br/>I certainly will not be the first or the last critic to call this a Capra-esque fable; it is exactly that, but in the most contemporary and sophisticated of terms. In some ways, the picture almost seems as if it is Spielberg's tribute to the legendary filmmaker. Frank Capra, an Italian immigrant, won three Academy Awards as the director of the American dream. Thematically, his best films demonstrated a basic faith in the essential goodness of the common man. And he told stories where honesty and justice triumphed over selfishness, deceit and institutional lack of caring. His classic films ('It's a Wonderful Life,' 'It Happened One Night,' 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,' 'You Can't Take it With You,' etc.) look dated now, in style and technique. These are different times. We aren't so naïve. We are, in fact, a lot more crass and cynical. But Frank Capra gave depression-era and post-World War II filmgoers a sense of hope and optimism; and he was proud when people could leave one of his films feeling good. <br/><br/>In 'The Terminal,' Steven Spielberg has given us a common man who faces a cross-section of every-day Americans and wins their hearts with a selfless act of diplomacy that disarms even his nemesis, the security chief. If you have some notion that this film is going to be sappy and irrelevant, be aware that there are scenes that crackle with Homeland Security paranoia; with the genuine pain of Flight Attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Zones), seven years into a self-destructive affair with an emotionally abusive married man; with people torn between self-interest and goodness.<br/><br/>This is a mature screenplay with rich, fully developed and utterly believable secondary characters, who, in a lesser work, would be nothing but caricatures. Chi McBride is Joe Mulroy, a baggage handler who runs poker nights where the prizes come from the lost luggage department; Diego Luna is Enrique Cruz, a food-service worker who bribes Viktor with meals to get him to play matchmaker with a beautiful INS agent (Zoë Saldana). And 85-year-old Kumar Pallana is Indian janitor Gupta Rajan, whose tragic past has left him a bitter old man. You care about all of them because they are so realand so funny.<br/><br/>One of the stars of this wonderful film is the three-story airline terminal set that was constructed in a Palmdale, California airplane hanger. Real airport security issues would have made impossible any notion of shooting the film in an actual airport, so the JFK mockup was created with the help of the kind of retailers that occupy every major terminal. No one paid product-placement fees to appear in the film, but instead built fully-functioning stores, including food-court restaurants that actually cranked out meals.<br/><br/>I have made friends with the people of JFK's International Terminal Lounge. I will be going back to visit again. I think there are truths there that I haven't even begun to imagine."

","Can you imagine spending nine months or more stuck in an airport?  I can't stand even walking through them much less living there.  For Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) in The Terminal that is exactly what he has to do - live in an airport.  <br/><br/>Due to some international fiasco between his home country and the United States, he cannot be granted a VISA and allowed into the country.  They cannot return him home either due to a rebellion that is going on. Therefore, he is stuck in the limbo land of a catch 22.<br/><br/>For something so simple as a story about a guy being stuck in an airport, Steven Spielberg delivers quite a great story.  How bad can a guy's luck get when he is forced to bathe in a public restroom?  Or when his bed is made of a bunch of seats?<br/><br/>To make matters worse he falls in love with a flight attendant, Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta Jones) who seems destined to pick the wrong men in her life.  What occurs thereafter is serious of comedic misadventures of a man who tries to occupy himself in an airport as best he can while under the watch of a ruthless airport security overseer (Stanley Tucci).<br/><br/>This movie is an upside-down love story, a tragedy, and above all else a comedy.  Aside from an unexpected ending, it delivers a nicely told tale of a simple man's delayed journey to America."
"tmw4587","Null","0","0","29 June 2004"," A nice fairy tale but too long
","As long as you keep telling yourself this movie is a fairy tale and fight the urge to poke holes in the plot you should be able to enjoy this one. I thought it would have been a better film if it were cut down by at least 15 to 20 minutes however. One plot line which could have been compressed was the romance between Hanks and Zeta-Jones.<br/><br/>The directing was good but not great. Spielberg couldn't seem to decide if this was a drama, comedy, romance or fantasy tale. Certainly real life is a mixture of all, but films that try to blend all those qualities tend to get confused.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Tom Hanks does a very solid job and was as completely believable as the story would allow. He is an amazing performer. Everytime I see him I can't help think of ""Bosom Buddies"" and ""Bachelor Party"" but in just a few minutes he always makes me forget about those roles and he becomes someone else. I predict Stanley Tucci will get nominated for either a Golden Globe or Oscar, maybe both. Not only was his character the best one in this film but his portrayal was excellent. You want to believe he's evil but just when you are convinced he does something which makes you think there's a nice guy hiding in there somewhere.<br/><br/>The one place where I think the writer and director went completely wrong was the beginning where the officers are trying to explain to Victor about his situation. It's obvious he doesn't understand English and yet the scenes where they keep talking to him and asking him questions goes on and on. I wanted to yell at the screen, ""He doesn't understand you, get an interpreter you idiots."" I know it's a fairy tale, but come on, there was NOBODY within 30 minutes of JFK who could speak his language? I found it irritating but at least they moved on and fixed the language problem later by having him self-teach."
"918","8","0","0","28 June 2004"," Spielberg again
","Spielberg Again<br/><br/>Though Spielberg is trying to break free, The Terminal continues the unchanged style he developed decades ago. A biography on Spielberg stressed how he wishes to gain acceptance from the majority through his films. The struggle of being an individual is usually handled by artists by declaring their differences, like Scorsese. This struggle of being different usually leads to personal cinema that reflects the artist, Scorsese's Mean Streets, James Joyce's A Portrait of an Artist, Picasso's many self portraits. THe artist declares how he and he alone sees the world. This is not the case with Spielberg who stresses the opposite. Instead of placing the focus on what's different the emphasis is placed on what is the same.<br/><br/>Even though Hanks portrays an individual from an unfamiliar, unrelatable, unamerican country, he behaves in a fashion that gathers empathy and understanding from an American audience. This sentimentality is not what Spielberg believes but desires. His strength as a filmmaker does not lie in his appeal to the intellect, like Coppola, but to the heart. An appeal to a universal heart by displaying (whether he knows it or not) archetypes that strike an emotional universal cord with his audience. Atonement with the Father, Women as Temptress, Refusal to the call and many others.<br/><br/>Spielberg turns an Indian janitor into a very familiar friend, and Hanks into all of us who have ever felt lost. This struggle for acceptance is not new to Hollywood, Chaplin did it in every movie. Beginning as the wimp who works up the courage to be the hero.<br/><br/>The Terminal falls between Catch Me If You Can's airports and Always' characters and sentimentality. Its a good movie but not a great one.<br/><br/>and though I'd prefer Spielberg to continue in the direction of Empire of the Sun and Schindler's List The Terminal does develop very nicely. The movie is a very interesting look at how an man survives in a new land. I wouldn't say it's allegorical but it does allude to many different ideas.<br/><br/>Spielberg depicts everything from learning the language to building a bed out of chairs. Hanks is stripped of all of Maslow?s Hierarchy of Needs. He is forced to survive much like he did in Cast Away. Without food he begins to work by gathering carts for quarters. These quarters buy him food. This job is closer to slave labor than anything else and is replaced by another willing to do the job for less. By working with his hands he becomes a construction worker and moves up in status. After saving a man's father's life he gathers the support of what could be a rebellion who wave a copy of Hank's hand like a flag. Hank's rebellion allows him to enter America, or the place where his dreams will come true.<br/><br/>What is maybe more interesting his Hank's decision to go back home. He journeys to the land to make his dreams come true and comes back down. But many filmmakers would argue that it's not what you show it's how you show it. Spielberg resorts to his classic ""ongoing lines"" such as ""do you have an appointment"", or ""one girl and two guys is a crowd"". Every Spielberg movie contains a set of ""on going lines"" for each main character and their consistency hints at the fact that it is Spielberg who is adding them not the many different screenwriters.(Jurassic Park- ""we spare no expense"")This is one of the methods Spielberg uses to develop an audiences' familiarity with a character. You feel like you know his characters because he allows you to learn a trait that is repeatedly proven true. And in this method is where Spielberg fails. Even though his style works he is not making any effort to change or invent new ways of communicating these ideas. He is only repeating himself. His cartoon type style doesn't seem to mature along with the heavy allusions and symbolism his mature story provides. It makes it harder to take the film seriously. Oliver Stone's telling of this story could have turned this picture into a possible award winner, while Spielberg who seems to be having too much fun won't earn any recognition at all. Though I don't think awards are in Spielberg's agenda for this movie, I still see his maturity as a problem. He wants to be serious but is afraid of losing his audience. Or maybe he just has too much fun.<br/><br/>Spielberg has made what he had called personal cinema before. Amblin' or any film he made before being put through the TV system relies heavily on adult themes. But when he made Jaws he seemed to start a trend he would never turn back on, and one we would never stop paying him for. A movie like Duel doesn't seem like a Spielberg movie in any recent terms.<br/><br/>The film The Terminal relies heavily on Hanks but for good reason. Spielberg seems to project himself through Hanks very well. Spielberg who is as famous for creating likable characters as he is for creating memorable sequences doesn't develop anything as memorable as Dicaprio teaching his French class but he doesn't miss all together either. Spielberg creates many sequences that seem like Hank's SNL skits. One scene involves Hanks and the airport's Supervisor trying to communicate to each other about his country which has ceased to exist. The skit taps into some of the all to familiar ""who's on first"" Abbot and Costello type miscommunication, all performed very new and fresh. Another involves Hanks making the airport a little more comfy to sleep in, something that could be found in a Keaton or Chaplin movie. And Finally another dinner scene between Jones and Hanks that seems to be Spielberg's take on Wes Anderson's movies as much as 1941 was a Landis film, A.I a Kubric film, and the Police car ride with Hanks telling his knock, knock joke in Catch Me if You Can a Terintino film.<br/><br/>Hank's as well as these many sequences gives the story a Spielbegian heart, not the heart found in Schindler's List or even Catch Me If You Can but a heart all the same. The movie is very likable and any Spielberg/Hanks fan will be pleased. Many scenes made me laugh till I cried.<br/><br/>Spielberg is good at pleasing his audience after... all he once said ""I am the audience."""

For such a great artist, this is a real come down.  It is an even greater come down for the exemplary director, Steven Spielberg who has created a real dud.  The concept is cute, but the film is long and tedious.  The relationship with Catherine Zeta Jones is tenuous to say the least.  It is testing one's imagination to find some sense of possibility in it, and leaves one wondering why it exists at all.  Stanly Tucci plays a humorous airport security chief who bungles it all.

"chrstphrtully","7","0","0","26 June 2004"," Oversentimental and Contrived Film Saved by Marvelous Hanks Performance
","SPOILERS HEREIN!!!<br/><br/>Although Steven Spielberg is rightly considered to be one of the greatest (if not the greatest) filmmaker of the thirty years, his films sometimes have the tendency to overplay their sentimentality and rely excessively upon contrivance to deliver an upbeat story.  The bad news is that ""The Terminal"" is no exception to this tendency.  The good news is that Tom Hanks is the star, and his enormously charming and natural performance makes the film remarkably entertaining.<br/><br/>Victor Navorski (Hanks) is a visitor from a fictional Eastern European country who, upon landing at JFK, learns that the government of his country has been deposed and that his passport and visa are no longer valid. Because of this, he cannot neither return to his home country, nor can he leave the airport.  The martinet-like Homeland Security chief (Stanley Tucci, who does remarkable things with a badly written part) wants Navorski out of his airport, and even at one point attempts to facilitate Victor's escape -- though Victor doesn't quite get the point.  Consequently, Victor effectively lives at the airport, sleeping at one of the gates, and proves surprisingly resourceful at providing for himself by collecting luggage carts (for the quarter deposit) and working as a contractor on the repairs to the terminal.<br/><br/>Although the film contains several scenes that are genuine comic gems, the screenplay (by Sascha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson) unfortunately resorts to largely one-dimensional and two-dimensional characterizations, as well as wild implausibilities (for example, how does Navorski continue working as a contractor in a federal airport AFTER Tucci learns what he's doing?) to sell the story.  Tucci in particular draws a short straw in this respect, given a character who alternates between understanding, blind officiousness, and outright cruelty with little or no motivation.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is no more fortunate in her rather inscrutable role; like Tucci, she gives it the best she has, and comes out somewhat the better for it, if for no other reason than her character is more likeable.  Of the other crucial supporting characters -- a crusty, Indian janitor (Kumar Pallana), a black baggage handler (Chi McBride), Tucci's chief of security (Barry Shabaka Henley), a Hispanic caterer (Diego Luna), and the young customs officer whom the caterer is attracted to (Zoe Saldana) -- only the last two are written as marginally, three-dimensional characters.  Spielberg himself doesn't resist the temptation to take every opportunity to milk the story or its characters for audience approval, making Victor nothing less than a veritable saint. While this may make the audience feel good, it comes fairly close to making the film ring hollow.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Hanks.  Like James Stewart, Hanks has the uncanny ability to infuse any character with a sort of genuineness, and to do this without effort.  This genuineness is what makes us root for Victor throughout, whether he's struggling to make a meal of crackers and condiments, facing off against Tucci or, in one of the film's best scenes, calming a potentially dangerous passenger.  It is a truly wonderful performance, and all the more impressive because the script gives him less than optimal material to work with.<br/><br/>On the whole, a delightful film to watch, with some major script and directing speed bumps along the way.  Thank God Hanks knows how and when to step on the brakes."

","With the simple and genuine attitude of Forrest Gump and the quiet loneliness of Castaway feel when we first meet Victor, one might think this movie to be boring, but instead we find ourselves a pleasant surprise in a story about the one law-abiding and all-around nice guy in a swarm of modern humanity. This movie soon reveals it's secrets as Victor begins to understand this new land he is not allowed to visit, learning English by buying the American version of the same book he has and deciphering the CNN scroll-by. <br/><br/>The sowing of little laughs here and there reveal a whimsical, feel-good movie that we don't often see anymore, with the American public usually going for movies with more CGI/Special Effects or car chases than actual brilliant acting performances. Victor's relationship with the Catherine Zeta-Jones character is more of a part of his experience while in America than a potential lover, and is sweet and not nearly as complicated as some would think (other than Zeta-Jones's off and on again boyfriend which doesn't involve Victor as much). It's truly quite refreshing to see a movie of this type and you really do feel the same victories as Victor does, from the little triumphs of figuring out the carts to seeing the head hauncho having a hissy fit over what he sees on the security monitors.<br/><br/>The friendships Victor has in this film become very real when troubles arise and you really believe that this Victor character is genuine and loyal. I'd highly suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see a relaxing movie after hard day at the office as it will help restore faith in the human nature. It's message is priceless."

","Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci do an excellent job in this ""Cast Away"" sort of movie.  Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski from Krokasia, pronounced Crow-K-Asia, (pardon my misspelling) and in the short time he is in the air from his country, that is supposedly just south of Russia, there is a military coup in which his country's leaders are taken hostage.  When he arrives at JFK he is told that because of the coup he cannot return to his homeland, or leave the Airport until the United States recognizes the coup's take over of his home country. Tucci plays self-serving head of security, Frank Dixon, at JFK.  He constantly tries to trick Navorski into setting foot on U.S. Soil so he can be treated as a threat to national security. Zeta-Jones does not have as big a part in this movie as expected.  She pops up every once and awhile and twists a love story into the plot.  However it is neither her not Tucci who make this movie enjoyable.  Hanks portrayal of innocent Navorski is what makes it a great laugh.

"chris1975","Null","0","0","20 June 2004"," An Enjoyable but Minor Film in the Hanks library
","Ahh another romantic comedy/ordinary guy overcoming extraordinary circumstances with a strong but compassionate determination that we have come to expect from a Tom Hanks movie. I've generally enjoyed Hanks' movies and I can say I liked this one, although not as much as say ""Sleepless In Seattle"" or ""Cast Away"". Very light plot points are mentioned so very low on the spoiler radar.<br/><br/>First off, there are going to people who are not going to enjoy this move. If you are one to go after the logic in the situation presented by ""The Terminal"" you are going to be annoyed. My logical side would often come up with lots of questions about key plot points. For example, my logical side couldn't exactly swallow the fact that in a NY airport they couldn't get a translator for Viktor's character even despite the fact that he had been in the terminal for an extended period of time. There are LOTS of logical inconsistencies like this throughout the movie, so if you are going to look at them, you are just going to p*ss off your fellow moviegoers once you start venting them out loud. Some tighter writing and good edits would have helped a lot on that end.<br/><br/>But if you are willing to leave your sense of real world logic at the door, then you can be drawn in by the emotion and the magic that Speilberg attempts to weave in ""The Terminal"". There are parts of the movie that can tug at your heart or really make you smile and make you go ""Awwwww"". One example is how Hanks face conveys his character just finding out about the turmoil in his home country. The sense of fear, confusion and anguish he expresses cant help but make you feel sorry for the guy who has just realized how royally screwed he is. The fact that he doesn't even speak English at this point in the movie shows how believably easy makes Hanks makes this look.<br/><br/>As much as I can see why the Hollywood buzz is a factor in casting, Katherine Zeta Jones wouldn't be my choice for the love interest stewardess character. Her stage presence doesn't present a quality of a ""hardened yet vulnerable"" woman that the role really needs. I come with a bit of a bias here, having enjoyed a lot of Hanks' previous works, but I really saw Meg Ryan (""Joe Vs. The Volcano"",""Sleepless in Seattle"") or even possibly Robin Wright Penn (Jenny in ""Forrest Gump"") more of a fit. Now that I think of it, Helen Hunt (""As Good as It Gets"") would have been good too.<br/><br/>The best way to look at the movie is the supporting character of Gupta, the Indian janitor. There are times when I found the writing they gave him, including the tagline(""Do you have an appointment?!?"") he spouts throughout the film annoying but his character gets some of the best moments in the movie - the dinner scene got the loudest laughs in the theatre. If you can accept Gupta and not be critical of his film flaws then you can enjoy the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Finally, an aspect of the film that I haven't seen been written about in detail yet is the message behind the movie - the notion of waiting. The entire movie and its characters revolve around it. An airport terminal - essentially a giant waiting room, Viktor is waiting to fulfill a promise, Ameilia the stewardess and Diego Luna's airport driver are waiting on love,and even the antagonist immigration executive Frank Dixon is waiting on his promotion. So the poster tagline ""Life is waiting"" has a sense of a philosophical meaning behind it.<br/><br/>So with summer releases going after more CGI and ""bigger is better"" mentality, its nice to see Hollywood come up with decent character driven films like ""The Terminal"". Its a flawed film but a flawed film that can be enjoyed."

","The names Spielberg and Hanks are nearly synonymous with quality films, and certainly when teamed together (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me if You Can). I was a tad surprised a movie like The Terminal was being released in the summer  when I first saw the trailer about a month ago I assumed it was a fall release  but this film ought to do well no matter what the season.<br/><br/>The set-up is simple: Hanks plays Viktor Navorsky, a simple man from one of the break- away Russian Republics whose country collapses while he's in mid-air. Once he arrives in JFK, they don't know what to do with him; they can't send him back, and they can't let him in. He's a man without a country, and customs boss Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is a die-hard by-the-book kind of guy who is determined not to break any laws in his handling of Navorsky's case. Along the way a stewardess falls into Viktor's life (literally) in the form of the dazzling Catherine-Zeta-Jones.<br/><br/>The premise is somewhat thin, so we must rely primarily on Hanks to carry the picture by himself, which he's already proven he can do (Castaway, et al), and here he does not disappoint. Hanks is charming as Navorsky, who is a simple man caught in a complicated puzzle with no idea how to get himself out. Viktor makes friends with various workers at the terminal, and his interactions with them are amusing; he helps bring one couple together, and he gets to know another fugitive from a foreign land. His semi-relationship with Amelia (Jones) is very well done and thankfully has a few twists in it to make it a little unpredictable.<br/><br/>Spielberg also does a lot with a movie that, let's face it, only has a few different sets, even if one of them is a sprawling mall complex. Unlike Viktor, we never feel confined by the movie, but we begin to see the airport as a self-contained little world, much as Viktor does. He continually turns adversity into opportunity, which helps to explain why being confined does not bother him so much.<br/><br/>But Viktor is a little too good. He's honest, hard-working, helpful, unassuming  he's everything we Americans like to think we are but rarely manage to be in reality. As is usual in a Spielberg film, Viktor's benevolent attitude toward people ends up coming back to him in spades, and he ends up being a sort of unofficial hero of the terminal. But Viktor never breaks down or has a moment of anger (which would be natural in such a case) and his optimism never fades, not even for a second. While it's a nice performance by Hanks, Viktor's just a little too good to be true.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci also does an excellent job, but like many authority figures in Spielberg films, he's a little two-dimensional. He alone grows increasingly personally annoyed with Viktor's successes, one after the other, and he constantly tries to thwart the man. Dixon is the opposite of Viktor, a man unaware that his own negative actions will come back on him; but that rings a little hollow in a situation where Viktor is such the everyman that people can't help but be drawn to him. Only someone inhuman could fail to respond to the perfect Viktor, and Dixon's increasing anger comes off as a bit petulant after a while.<br/><br/>The film is certainly worth going to see; there are some very funny and touching moments in it, and one sub-plot's resolution pleased me greatly toward the end. Hanks gives a winning performance and both Tucci and Jones are able to match him, no easy feat. But the film's a shade too black and white to be an emotional powerhouse; even one scene of Viktor losing his temper, even if he were all alone, would have helped. The Terminal is an enjoyable film, certainly worth going to see, but honestly I expected something a little more complicated and a little less obvious given the magnitude of the talent involved."
"Charles_LePoje","Null","0","0","18 June 2004"," Terminal Loneliness
","With 'The Terminal' Steven Spielberg has created a sweet, light-hearted comedy which is sure to please broad audiences and which will be a sizable financial bonanza for its producers. Spielberg's latest film has no higher ambition than to entertain. Its modest, understated approach serves the film well. The amalgam of the proper handling of the solid comedic material, Spielberg and Hank's superior talents, precise casting, and apt cinematography has concocted a benevolent, likable and appetizing movie experience.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' talent flourishes to full bloom in 'The Terminal'. After an unfortunate acting choices in 'The Ladykillers' and in 'The Road to Perdition', Hanks is back to his prime form! In the film, he stars as Victor Navorski, a Russian-speaking visitor to New York City. Victor is caught in immigration limbo that leaves him stranded in the airport terminal for nine months. The film is a star vehicle and Hanks controls it like a pro. He is crucial for the film's success. The mastery of his performance, the indispensable value he contributes to the success of the project, brings to mind another comedic actor's splendid performance - Hugh Grant's charming rendition of a politically incorrect playboy in the 2002 trendy comedy 'About a Boy'. <br/><br/>'The Terminal' wastes no time in identifying and placing obstacles Victor needs to overcome. Empathy with the hero is thus easily established and we root for Victor right from the start. The film's first half-hour is most satisfying as we witness Victor's ingenuity in adjusting to new, extraordinary circumstances.<br/><br/>Inevitable, Victor meets a romantic interest in Amelia, a flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. The characterization of the airline stewardess is a potent symbol that effectively mirrors Victor's current state - stranded, lonely and disjoined from the rest of the world.  Amelia has lost faith in man, which is easier for a beautiful woman in her profession than in any other. For a brief moment she imagines that Victor could be just the right man for her. It is commendable that the filmmakers have evaded traps in defining their evolving relationship, traps that could have turned the film into a sappy melodrama. Zeta-Jones plays Amelia with gusto and just the right mixture of naiveté and desperation.  <br/><br/>A comedy without a distinguished, pointed plot-line need to draw laughs from creative characterization of its supporting players. Here, Stanley Tucci playing the airport chief security official Frank Dixon and Kumar Pallana ('Royal Tenenbaums') as an airport janitor Gupta Rajan are especially noteworthy. Pallana, in pulling some of the antics obviously inspired by the Windex Dad from 'My Big Greek Wedding' incites more laughter than anyone but Hanks.<br/><br/>One of the missed opportunities to make this a more engaging picture is a failure to deeper explore and exploit Victor's motivation for coming to America. A desire to get a photo signed by an obscure jazz player, a missing link in his father's collection appears to be full of creative potentials and worthy of a substantial subplot.<br/><br/>Endings in Hollywood pictures have often been huge letdowns. Ever so frequently a wrap-up of a story is tailored to conform to latest market research or audience's expectations. It is refreshing that 'The Terminal' ends somewhat unpredictably but more to the story's spirit adding a dose of credibility to its fragile premise.<br/><br/>This fictionally weak, convoluted premise is actually based on a true-life tale of an Iranian refugee who has been living in Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport for 16 years. Life is stranger than fiction and unfortunately not always as humorous. In bizarre turn of events, the true-life tale of the Iranian refugee got a real Hollywood ending - he has received a rumored $250,000 from DreamWorks for the rights to his story."
"seaview1","Null","0","0","17 June 2004"," Switching Gears at the Terminal
","Owing more to the pace and softer shading of Catch Me If You Can than the dark side of Minority Report or Artificial Intelligence, Steven Spielberg switches gears to a simple, humorous tale of love and redemption in The Terminal. Since lightweight Spielberg is better than almost anything out there, this should give perspective to an enchanting tale inspired by a real life incident. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays a foreign visitor on a journey to New York City who gets stopped at JFK Airport when his country ceases to exist amid a revolution. Through a `Catch-22', he is stranded at the airport unable to enter the U.S. and prevented from returning to his country. This limbo lasts more than just a few days and grows into weeks and finally months. <br/><br/>What to do in a strange land unable to understand the language and how to survive? These are some of the interesting questions that are dealt with along the way. We meet a myriad of characters at the airport who befriend Hanks' character including a hysterical turn by Kumar Pallana (A Wes Anderson discovery) as a cantankerous janitor, a glamorous Catherine Zeta-Jones as an air attendant who captures Hanks' interest and ardor, and a wonderful performance by Stanley Tucci as a menacing head of airport security. <br/><br/>The production is first class all the way as one would expect from a Spielberg film. Every actor/actress no matter how small the role is memorable. How unfortunate that the gold standard means almost missing John Williams touching score which melds so seamlessly to the storyline.<br/><br/>
When I said lightweight, this is much more than a one note movie. It starts slowly at a measured pace and builds layers subtly while developing a swell of pathos and storyline. No doubt this will be a hit for the Spielberg/Hanks tandem which is developing into a very dependable source of thoughtful, mass entertainment. In the end, this film is about facing one's purpose and meaning, and experiencing and reveling in life despite any obvious limitations. To those who say this is boring or doesn't measure up to past Spielberg efforts, I say, `lighten up and smell the roses.'"

","""Terminal"" is funny, amusing, and cute. Tom Hanks was superior and authentic - behavior, body mannerisms and voice inflection, down to smallest details (check out the notorious resourcefulness of Eastern-Europeans - making a bed from lounge chairs minus arm rests). I liked how Mr. Sp. touched on family relations, dysfunctional romance, and ethnic idiosyncrasies. I am a huge fan of Mr. Sp.'s towering genius.<br/><br/>BUT... while I laughed a lot while watching ""Terminal,"" I ALSO thought that it was utterly offensive and irresponsible in its treatment of the subject of Eastern Europeans' exodus and immigration. Viktor was a goof and a warm-hearted idiot. He was an inconsistent composite Slavic archetype - spoke at least 5 broken Slavic languages; Krakosia sounds like the Polish town of Krakow; his Fodor books were printed in plain Russian (Polish hate Russians' guts and anything Russian).<br/><br/>What offended me is this: 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and mass immigration of E.Europeans into the US, the first-ever Hollywood film that touches this subject is an irresponsible drivel about a one-day visit to NYC of a misty-eyed, autograph-collecting goof. Sadly, it comes from the director who has a history of making magnificent artistic statements about subjects deserving of such treatments.

"don-lockwood","5","2","5","25 October 2005"," One of the worst endings in film
","I'm sorry to fans of this movie, but I, like many critics, was sorely disappointed with the final product. Given the renowned talents of Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, this should have been a big hit and a smart film. Unfortunately for the audience, it is neither.<br/><br/>The premise is striking, if seemingly implausible: A foreigner who lost his passport literally becomes trapped in an American airport. The set design is fantastic, as each room is instilled with its own unique feel, so that the audience, like Tom Hanks's central character, can begin to identify with the airport as his new (if hopefully temporary) ""home."" In addition, the character development is strong, and Hanks, who has previously proved he can pull off just about anything on screen, is delightfully colorful and out of character. There are a few good supporting turns, and, at worst, the movie always maintains a hint of the discovery potential in the airport, a simultaneously inviting and intimidating barrier to a new world.<br/><br/>However, the film suffers from a plodding pace and a lack of unity that can bring together the several pleasant but meaningless subplots. The script tries not to be cursory in its character development, but its touches are never quite successful in engaging the audience's interest as well as their sympathy. Particularly, Catherine Zeta-Jones is, as always, an energetic star, but here she is relegated to essentially a supporting role and should have entered the storyline sooner and stayed with it longer. Even her general enthusiasm can't make up for the slower scenes, and Zeta-Jones, though on par with an old-school glamor/movie icon in everything that she does, frankly seems a little miscast here as the wronged wife to be pitied. Her chemistry with Hanks isn't strong enough, either.<br/><br/>But the most appalling aspect of this otherwise skillfully made movie was its throwaway finale, perhaps the WORST film ending I have seen (at least since ""The Stepford Wives""). It's not a totally implausible ending, as in that aforementioned movie, but it's just as distasteful and disappointing. Hanks, after being green-lit to finally go home to his war-ridden country, decides to venture out into New York City to get the autograph of his dead father's favorite jazz legend (forgive me, I'm hazy on the details, but it's not like this ploy makes the dramatic tension of the rest of the movie seem worthwhile anyway, nor does it do much for character development). Catherine Zeta-Jones, who, when we last saw her, apparently feigned complacency with her boyfriend so as not to prevent Hanks from flying home as soon as possible, doesn't even return in the final scene! WHAT A COPOUT!!! Give the audience what they want! Granted, a perfect Hollywood ending might've seemed a little too predictable, even for Spielberg, but this film was billed as a light romantic comedy (released in the summer, for Pete's sake!), and it is neither very funny nor ever moving enough to qualify as pure drama. There is nothing worse in a borderline movie than a bad ending that lasts longest in the audience's collective memory. This production is at times enjoyable and never offensive, but its wrap-up is a complete washout that the filmmakers never should have approved."

I kept telling myself, ""Relax, for God's sake. It's a FANTASY and a PARABLE about patience, waiting, and home, and also (again) about America and about one little man's attempt to persevere against the odds in the face of an uncaring bureaucracy.""<br/><br/>I also kept telling myself,""Look, a lot of this movie is just an excuse to play out the half-baked notions any long distance traveler gets...what would it be like to actually stay in a huge place that is intended as nothing more than a waiting zone, that attempts to provide the comforts of home while at the same time being more sterile and impersonal than any home could ever be? How would you cope? How would you pass the time? What minor comforts and pleasures would you manage to finagle from a place of tiles, fast food, newsstands, vending machines, indoor/outdoor carpeting, vinyl seats and indifferent strangers? What would it be like to live like a mouse in the walls here? What hidden sanctuaries and hideyholes would you find as you explored?"" <br/><br/>And I kept reminding myself, ""Look, Tom Hanks is great in this. He's as appealing as usual in an ego-less noble ""Everyman"" role. There's not a false note in his entire performance (although it's an easy role to play.) And Jones is fine, and hits just the right notes. And the supporting character actors are, well, whimsical and charming and wistful etc., just like they always are in a Spielberg fantasy setting. Hell, even Stanley Tucci, who I LOVE as a character actor is great, even if he plays an officious creep.""<br/><br/>Nothing worked. I don't care if its a fantasy - there is NO WAY that even an officious bureaucrat would leave someone to starve (in a very public way) in the middle of a major metropolitan airport. Even if he was the most officious, rigid prick in the Western Hemisphere, one call to the N.Y.Times, the Wall Street Journal, ""60 Minutes"", etc from one of the many ""little people"" that Hanks made friends with would bring such a sh*tstorm of public indignation down on Tucci that his career would be toast in 1 hour. And Tucci would know this. So he could put in 5 minutes of work and solve the problem ""under the table"". One call to the State Department asking to grant him asylum at the Embassy of a neutral nation...one temporary visa to a nearby airport hotel under house arrest,with an Air Marshall to keep an eye on him...one appeal to the Red Cross or the ACLU...ANYONE...could have resolved the problem and kept Hanks' character safe and comfortable (and out of the public eye) until they knew what to do with him. <br/><br/>So the fact that not one of the 'little' folks that supposedly came to know and love Hanks ever made that one phone call to help him...that Tucci, whose very job depended on keeping things clean, safe, and orderly in his airport, couldn't make a judgment call based on decades of experience to assist an obviously harmless and inoffensive man...that kept grinding into my thinking like a stone in my shoe, and kept me from enjoying all the cutesy charming sentimentality that Spielberg was slathering on by the barge-load. <br/><br/>Otherwise, it had some nice moments. I especially liked the dining scene between Hanks and Jones on the balcony pavilion overlooking the concourse. And I appreciated that Zeta-Jones eventually chose to resume her life with her former beau, which rang true to the choice a women in her position would almost certainly make for her own emtional survival. <br/><br/>Otherwise, though...Spielberg,you SUCK."

It seems this person was stuck in the airport in Paris for something like 18 months, before his situation was resolved.

"itamarscomix","4","2","5","24 May 2005"," Another half-baked film from Steven Spielberg
","It's been over a decade since Spielberg had his one-two combo in 1993 with a groundbreaking futuristic action film (Jurassic Park) and a truly beautiful historical drama (Schindler's List) and, unless you count Saving Private Ryan (which, in my opinion, has several ingenious scenes but is too long and has a lot of filler) it's been that long since we've seen a truly memorable offering from the great master of the 70s and 80s. That's not to say that he made a bad film; there's some to be said for Catch Me If You Can, Minority Report, Amistad and, to a certain extent, AI as well; but none of these show any sign of the brilliant and original spark of the genius who created Close Encounters, Jaws, ET, Indiana Jones, The Color Purple, Empire of the Sun, or Duel. On the contrary - Spielberg seems to have created a monster he cannot control, and each film he makes seems, at least a bit, like a cruel parody on him, as he employs every Hollywood cliché that he himself invented all those years ago. <br/><br/>The Terminal is no exception. Spielberg's third collaboration with Tom Hanks - who (apologies to the hordes of Hanks fans out there), be he an astronaut, a boy in an adult body, a detective, a con artist or a refugee from a war-torn country, will always be Tom Hanks - which, like the other two, is based on a true story, is by far the weakest of the bunch. The film starts out with a great and fascinating premise, as a biting satire about the cruelty of capitalist bureaucracy, and as long as that is the subject, it's both funny and touching, as it shows the way the Uncle Sam treads all over the little man. Spielberg, however, doesn't manage to fill more than thirty minutes with that concept, and soon enough we find him swimming towards the safe and known shores of physical humor and romantic comedy. The story about the man forced to live in an airport is of course a terrible stretch, but it gets across and manages to convince; once Catherine Zeta Jones steps in is when the story becomes unbelievable. The film soon turns into a cheesy, unconvincing romance with some really bad dialogue, and loses all its uniqueness and originality. <br/><br/>Obviously, The Terminal has its moments; it's Spielberg, after all, and is entertaining at the very least. I expected more, though. In all likelihood this is Spielberg's worst movie, or at least the worst in some years. This one is good for a video rental, no more."
"Critical Eye UK","3","2","5","7 May 2005"," Mr Deedski Goes To New York
","Mean-spirited indeed(ski) would be he who criticises a movie for its timing. But then again, I am. So here goes: Spielberg did everything and more in Terminal's 2-hour plus running time in 'Amazing Stories', the 80s / 90s feel-good TV shows that managed the same yearnings for innocence and the American Dream -- but in 40 minutes or less.<br/><br/>A lot earlier than that, and almost certainly before the majority of reviewers here were even born, Frank Capra did the same. But with a stronger script. And a better cast. And -- and this is the clincher -- a far greater sense of timing.<br/><br/>For 'Terminal' is at least 60 years too late. The feel-good to which it aspires, the whimsy which it (laudably) seeks to celebrate, has long gone from any scenario involving the uncomprehending stateless trapped in the aspic of a hostile world.<br/><br/>Truth is, it's difficult to think when such a scenario was remotely heart-warming anyway. Unless I missed some great hit-of-the-season show like 'Ellis Island: The Laugh-In'.<br/><br/>With sets, art direction and special effects to emigrate, if not die, for, 'Terminal' certainly has a heightened sense of reality. But other than that, it's stupefyingly empty, a vast and expensive transit lounge of half-formed ideas ground under the footsteps of a script that moves so clinically from A to B that it seems no more than a mechanistic reprise of elementary screen-writing -- you know the primer I mean, where 10 pages in this happens and 20 pages in this happens, and the hook gets baited not a moment later than halfway down page 38. . .<br/><br/>With 'Close Encounters' and 'ET', Spielberg showed true genius as a film maker capable of chronicling humanity's endearing panoply of hopes, dreams, fallibilities and fears.<br/><br/>With 'Terminal', he has Tom Hanks doing a Chaplinesque shuffle.<br/><br/>There's no humanity here. No relevance (as Capra had). And seemingly no understanding of the real obscenity of small lives shattered by big bureaucracies. Everyman does not live in this particular terminal, only a cast of characters unearthed from Capra's back-stock, all of them increasingly over-drawn and thus increasingly over-wrought.<br/><br/>Calling this 'a masterpiece' is like calling a painting-by-numbers canvas a genuine artwork.<br/><br/>Come on, Spielberg. The creative genius you have as one of the finest film-makers of this or any other generation cries out for something far, far better than this. Do us all a favour and find it quickly, before people start to wonder if your talent has left the departure gate once and for all. . ."

All he wants to do is fulfill a nebulous mission, but standing in his way is the airport's expedient head of security (Stanley Tucci), all of which sets up a standard fish-out-of-water story that has its moments but ultimately falls short.<br/><br/>Mildly reminiscent of ""Cast Away"", Hanks occasionally shines as a character out of his element, as his attention to small things and everyman qualities allow the viewer to play along as he scrapes by in an airport. (Besides, who hasn't been stuck in an airport for what seems like forever?) However his selective understanding of English raises eyebrows with its convenience, which is perhaps the overriding problem with ""Terminal"". Similarly, everything is simply too conducive to the direction of the story, without providing a foundation for such progression. Need two people to fall in love? Oh look, they happen to share a quirky passion. Need to jump ahead days or weeks? Thirty seconds of filler should suffice. Plus the partial truths and misunderstandings create the feeling of a teen comedy with a grown-up cast. ultra-realism isn't necessary, but too many decisions and communications (or lack thereof) are simply too implausible to take seriously.<br/><br/>In less capable hands, ""Terminal"" would have been unbearably buttery due to such faults; but the solid lead work of Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, accompanied by good-as-usual supporting actors like Tucci, creates at least marginally interesting characters. Overall though, the characters hit one note and little more. Those notes are usually played well, but soon grow monotonous. Director Steven Spielberg's uncanny, sometimes grating, ability to generate emotional power also contributes to the enjoyability, which doesn't reach full speed until the final act, despite the attempts of John Williams's pleasantly upbeat score to zip the movie forward.<br/><br/>This is because the motivation of Hanks's character is absent for first 90 minutes of the film. The idea is presumably to lure the audience along while wondering why, but the question is staged as a side attraction rather than the main event. Once revealed, that story arc finishes strong, but the film is then so far behind that it can't catch up, like a late but futile kick down the stretch of a track race.<br/><br/>Like its main character who is limited by his surroundings, ""The Terminal"" perseveres with what meager sustenance it has, but in the end not even the prominent talent of the participants can launch the movie past its mediocre story. The script surely looked much better on paper than on screen, and the movie reflects that, promising so much yet delivering so little.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A major disappointment. 5 of 10, and that's generous."
"Angostura","3","2","5","7 March 2005"," An unusual and interesting premise, a cliché-ridden & dull film.
","This film, based loosely on a true story of a man stuck in Charles de Galles airport is a real stinker. The sad part is that it could have been ... should have been good. <br/><br/>It's a fabulously quirky scenario, which could have been built into a Groundhog Day-esque story, if that is the way the writers wanted to go.<br/><br/>Sadly, the writers didn't know *which* way they wanted to go, and must take most of the responsibility.<br/><br/>The plot line fails to work coherently, and is poorly crafted, sometimes veering towards redemption movie, sometimes heading towards slapstick, but never (like the lead character) ever getting to any destination, I like cross-genre surprising films, but this film's only surprise is its lack of surprises . The characters are straight of out central casting. No cliché is left unturned. <br/><br/>A special mention must go to Catherine Zeta-Jones for a performance of mind-numbing shallowness. She's working with a poor script, but... really!<br/><br/>Still, the set design is excellent - so an extra star for that."
"friveraz","4","2","5","9 January 2005"," What a waste
","I was ready for a light, cheesy movie; but The Terminal ended up being a total head-scratcher. How can such a stupid plot be made into a high budget movie? The premise itself is ridiculous, and requires a fourth grader's grasp of international relations to accept. Since when does a coup attempt, or a civil war make a country ""non-existant"".<br/><br/>Hanks as Navorski comes across more as a moron than someone who simply doesn't speak English. The love story between Hanks and Zeta-Jones is saved from being a complete cheese-fest at the end by the half-unexpected ""twist"". The love interest's demise was necessary to bring some semblance of seriousness to the movie after the silly marriage between two secondary characters."
"AvinashPatalay","Null","2","5","6 December 2004"," Not Spielberg's standards...
","I watched the movie for two reasons.... Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Disappointed to say that it does not match Spielberg's standards. Spielberg tries to balance his portfolio by alternating scifi movies and realistic ones. This time I was expecting the likes of Saving Pvt Ryan, Schindlers List but I guess, the the plot itself was mellow so there was nothing much the director could have given value-addition. In one of the interviews Spielberg confessed that once that he had lost his creative ability since he has taken the helm of production affairs. I agree with him. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks tries to live to the skin of Victor Navorski, a citizen of East European country Krakozia which faces internal coup the moment he lands at NYC Airport. Admirably Tom Hanks has delivered a splendid performance to the extent he seems convincing as he tries to learn and speak English. And more so... how he makes the Terminal a home, making friends, finding job and finding love!! As every story needs a fly in the ointment, we have the Airport Manager who plays spoil sport and apparently has no job except to be at the back of our main hero. <br/><br/>A few interesting tracks and episodes in the Terminal about Tom Hanks playing cupid between two airport staff. The Indian Janitor evoked a few laughs. Catherine Zeta Jones was okay.<br/><br/>Ending was not upto the expectations revealing the suspense of can of peanuts. <br/><br/>Its one of those movies you would watch to be updated on the directors filmography and forget about it the moment you walk out of the cinema hall."

Yes, I really only made it 25 minutes into the movie until I practically ran to the DVD player to eject it.<br/><br/>There was not one thing funny or even remotely entertaining within the first 25 minutes. It was so ridiculous to watch supposed airport personnel continue to have lengthy and in depth conversations with someone that doesn't even understand English. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, if you're in the same situation I was, go and rent an oldie but a goody."

","We went to see the film without any preconceptions and frankly, once we accepted the impossibility of this situation, we fell right under its spell. Yes, it's a bit long, yet it kept our attention until the end.<br/><br/>I have no idea who pitched this tale to Mr. Spielberg. Evidently, the story is a far cry from reality to people like Viktor, in the situation he encounters upon arriving in New York. Viktor would have been held by the Immigration authorities, then processed, and sent to a detention center to wait for his appointment to see a judge, who ultimately would have decided his fate. <br/><br/>No one in this situation would have been allowed to stay unguarded in the terminal, as in the case of this stateless man. Then again, we wouldn't have had a film, at all. The screen play twists the facts to adapt the story for a Tom Hanks vehicle.<br/><br/>At the beginning it takes a while to adjust to Tom Hanks supposedly Russian accent. The inner life of the terminal is brought to life by the people that play minor roles in the movie. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg make a great team. The director and its star compliment one another. Mr. Hanks is delightful as this man who, through no fault of his own, is stuck by the red tape encountered at his arrival in this country, at the present time. <br/><br/>Catherine Zeta Jones' flight attendant is a fake. Ms Zeta Jones makes us like her, in spite of knowing she is as deep as a Danielle Steele novel. When this woman selects a Napoleon biography from the book store, many people laughed knowing a flight attendant and Napoleon are the equivalent of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana, add a comic relief to the film.<br/><br/>
The only remaining question is whether all the brands that are prominently displayed in the terminal, (this could have easily been a shopping mall), paid the film makers to have their brands displayed  in the film."

","Anything with Tom Hanks in I generally like, but this was disappointing. <br/><br/>The premise starts off well enough. Viktor Navorski is visiting New York in homage to his late fathers memory, collecting a missing musicians autograph, to complete his fathers collection of autographs. (The description of the film describes him as an 'Eastern Immigrant' for some reason - he was visiting the U.S. not emmigrating to the U.S.) <br/><br/>Due to political upheaval at home, he is made a person of no nationality. <br/><br/>He cannot step outside the airport or he will be arrested but he can stay in the airport. Alright we can swallow this in the name of artistic license.<br/><br/>The nasty airport boss wants him gone, but clever Viktor learns to earn his keep within the airport helped by sympathetic employees. <br/><br/>All along I kept thinking Viktor would turn out to be something great, a nobel prize winning physicist or something. That the nasty airport boss thought he was picking on a 'little guy'. Only to be revealed to be a big man. <br/><br/>But no, he's just a foreign ordinary guy trying to obtain the last autograph missing in fathers jazz musicians autograph collection. Fair enough, if rather boring. <br/><br/>Catherine Zeta Jones wanders in an out of the airport as a slut Stewardess embroiled in an affair with a married man. she becomes friends with Viktor. OK, but again rather boring. <br/><br/>The nasty airport boss keeps trying to 'get' Viktor but with the help of sympathetic airport employees he makes it outside to get his autograph and his countries political upheaval settles down again. <br/><br/>It's not terrible, just boring, certainly disappointing offering from Hanks/Spielberg"

Especially disappointing to me was the second half of the movie when everything started to look more and more implausible and unrealistic. The romantic story just ate away much of the time--it was unrealistic, mawkish even. The end was too sugary.

","Victor Navorksi (played by Tom Hanks), a man from the Eastern European nation of Krakozhia, flies into JFK airport. At Customs he is forbidden entry to the USA - Krakozhia has been taken over in a coup and the US does not currently recognise the new regime, or nation. In addition, the borders of Krakozhia are now closed. This leaves Victor in limbo - he cannot enter the US or go back to Krakozhia. While waiting for the diplomatic situation to sort itself out he is forced to live in the International Transit section of JFK, living off his own resourcefulness. He also makes some new friends along the way.<br/><br/>Painful to watch. The movie had heaps of potential as a wry look at diplomacy and international politics and how it affects everyday people. Instead director Steven Spielberg tries to make this thought-provoking situation into a comedy.<br/><br/>Not that it's funny. Well, maybe if you're 10 years old, it's funny, but if you've got a developed sense of humour or any degree of intelligence, it's not funny at all. 10-year-olds do seem to be the target market as the ""humour"" is corny and involves cultural stereotypes, no-speak-English farce and other cheap shots.<br/><br/>Continuing the made-for-kids theme, the movie quickly regenerates into a poor downtrodden hero vs all-powerful bad guy caper. Pity that the ""bad guy"", the head of security for JFK, is actually trying to help Victor, while doing his job. He gives Victor ample opportunities and avenues to improve his situation but Victor is too stupid to take them. Yet Spielberg makes him the bad guy and Victor the good guy.<br/><br/>There is also a romantic drama element to this. Once again, it's more kids' fantasy than anything approaching reality. The catering guy-customs woman story was very stupid and contrived. The Victor- air hostess story was a bit more realistic, but very trite.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks delivers easily his most irritating performance, laying on the faux Russian accent and no-speak-English shtick so thick that it is impossible to like Victor. <br/><br/>Then we have inconsistencies in character behaviour, sub-plots that go nowhere, random stuff that just happens to sort out a situation, cheesy sentimentality. The only times I liked the movie were when Victor showed some resourcefulness (eg the baggage trolleys/25c).<br/><br/>What a mess."

So then, the boss at the airport decides to let him stay there until further investigation. <br/><br/>The movie is about a man who is really nice to everyone.

","The Terminal is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's not a movie I watch often, but it makes me smile when I see it.<br/><br/>The movie is loosely based on a true story about a Iranian guy who lived in a French airport for 3 years. Basically Tom Hanks plays Viktor, a middle age man who came from a small (and fictional) Eastern European country that falls into a state of civil war. Because of a coup by the military the old government has fallen and the United States refuses to recognize the new government. All this happens while Viktor is on a flight to JFK International Airport in New York City. Because of the situation is visa is no longer recognized as valid and the US is not accepting his passport and because of the war he has no way of going home. Viktor is effectively trapped in the international passenger terminal at JFK.<br/><br/>And this is really the best parts of the movie. Viktor doesn't speak English and doesn't understand what he's being told and there is this great scene while he watches in horror news coverage of the war and not understand a word of it; just that war broke out in his country. Viktor literally makes gate 26 (which is out of service because of construction) his home. I enjoyed the movie the most watching him figuring things out like how to get money to eat, how he makes friends with the airport employees, or how he learns English. He's such an earnest and clever man that you can't help like him and that's what makes this movie work.<br/><br/>The cons of this movie is the romantic subplot that is deeply unsatisfying and while does at least have some impact on the plot, leaves me thinking this didn't need to be here. The other thing is the movie is a shameless whore. It's almost funny how much product placement there is. Boss, Discovery Store, Starbucks, Borders, Burger King, etc. are visible at nearly every shot.<br/><br/>Also the antagonist of this movie doesn't make sense. Basically it's this Homeland Security guy who just doesn't like Viktor. I think this might be some commentary on our system, but his superiors tell him he could learn a thing or two from Viktor and it just seems that problem is just with this one guy. He seems to make it personal. They don't take it to over-the-top levels.<br/><br/>Still, Tom Hanks is really good and it holds up for me. If it comes up for rental or on TV it's not a bad sit."

","Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from Krakozhia arrives in JFK. He speaks limited English and has limited understanding. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) tells him that his country has just had a coup and the US has revoked his visa. Viktor is a stateless man with no status. Dixon can't allow him to enter the country but he can't detain him either. Dixon allows him to move freely in the international transit lounge. However the temporary situation turns into a long running saga. Dixon is getting promoted. He tries to get Viktor to leave on his own. Viktor befriends various people. He meets flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and pretends to be a frequent traveler. <br/><br/>This is an uncomfortable mix of serious and light-hearted. The whole thing just strikes me as being fake. It starts with the fake country. Then there is Tom Hanks faking an accent. His English is conveniently bad when the movie needs it to be but good enough whenever the movie wants. Also there is the fake setup. There may be a heart-warming funny indie film here somewhere but it needs an unknown to play this role. The story has some serious stuff but the light comedy really whitewashes it. Director Steven Spielberg is probably not the right guy for this film and Hanks is too recognizable. I don't want to be a Scrooge and hate on this light comedy. Most of it doesn't work for me. Spielberg is such a master filmmaker that he squeezes some heart-wrenching moments as well as some light comedy out of it."
"g-bodyl","9","1","2","11 May 2014"," Brings Me A Good Feeling!
","The Terminal is one of the better feel-good movies I have seen in recent years. After watching it, I just felt so good about life because of this movie. This is why I can admit that Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors. He doesn't always make Oscar-friendly movies, which is good because he can make great films that are made to entertain, not win accolades. This film is very charming, has several funny moments even if didn't try to have them, has fantastic acting, and it basically answers the question of what living in an airport would be like.<br/><br/>Spielberg directs a film about a guy named Viktor Navorski who is traveling to New York, but is denied entry to America. He is not allowed to return home as well because his country is at war. So, that means he is forced to stay at JFK. While there, he learns English, makes some friends, has encounters with a by-the-book Director of Customs, and even finds love.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. In recent years, we haven't much called Tom Hanks funny. But he returns to his comedic roots as Viktor and shows he can be funny without trying. He has such an impeccable taste when it comes to his timing. Catherine Zeta-Jones is solid as the flight attendant Viktor falls for. In every movie Stanley Tucci has been in, he manages to steal his scenes. That means he is excellent in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, The Terminal is one of Spielberg's awesome feel-good movies. This movie is not meant to win awards, but it has an objective to please the audience and give them quality entertainment. This film can be schmaltzy at times, but in a very good way. The screenplay is very well-written and is often heart-touching. John Williams contributes another great score, though a little low-key. Another fine directorial effort by Spielberg. I rate this film 9/10."
"tomgillespie2002","4","1","2","8 May 2013"," Manipulative attempt to re-create the magic of Capra
","Film-makers frequently find themselves going back to basics or back to their roots in order to find inspiration, rather than seeking innovation. Two of Hollywood's arguably most powerful men - Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks - did precisely this back in 2004 with the release of The Terminal, apparently based on the 18-year stay at Charles de Gaulle airport experienced by Iranian refugee Mehran Karimi Nasseri (although the film-makers and producers have failed to acknowledge it). Spielberg had been striving for bid-budget, CGI-laden blockbusters such as A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Minority Report (2002), and historical epics like Amistad (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998), before he made The Terminal. Although those films were generally good to very good, Spielberg returned to something more simple and heartfelt; something in the vein of Frank Capra or Billy Wilder, who combined sentiment and romanticism to such a glorious effect. Well, to be frank, he shouldn't have bothered.<br/><br/>Victor Navorski (Hanks) arrives at JFK International Airport from his (fictional) home country of Krakozhia, with the intention of getting the autograph of a famous jazz musician who was loved by his late father in New York. Though what he doesn't know is that Krakozhia's government has been overthrown, leading do a devastating civil war. This puts Head of CPB Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) in a difficult situation, as America no longer recognises Krakozhia as a country, voiding Victor's passport and cancelling his right to leave the airport doors. So Victor sets up home in the terminal, making money by returning baggage carts back to their holders for 25 cents a cart, and befriending the various oddballs and desperado's in the airport. He also meets flight attendant Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an emotionally unstable woman who is in a relationship with a married man. Despite Dixon's frequent attempts to thwart Victor's activities, Victor becomes extremely popular with the airport's inhabitants by performing various good deeds.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that Spielberg's movies are frequently lambasted for, it is for their cloying sentimentality. Even his darkest output, such as Minority Report and Munich (2005) had their moments of emotional embraces to the sound of a string score that felt shoe-horned in. With The Terminal, Spielberg has gone all-out with the rom-com aesthetic. The result is a manipulating and almost fraudulent throw-back to the great Cary Grant films of the 1930's, capturing none of the magic of Spielberg's idols. Hanks is good value as always, but the character of Victor is almost offensive in it's stereotyping of the simple, almost idiotic foreigner.<br/><br/>The collection of supporting characters don't fair much better either, with Dixon's Hitler-esque CPB man raising questions as to the reasons behind his hatred for Victor. Everyone else seems to like him, even his own men, so is he doing it for career progression? His own soon-to-be- retiring boss informs him that empathy and humanity are key to the job, and if Dixon needs to be told this, then how has he gotten as far as he has up to now? Zeta-Jones's Andrea at least puts a different spin on the familiar rom-com heroine, with her erratic behaviour and questionable decision-making at least adding a bit of dimension. The most impressive aspect of the film is actually the set, built from scratch after no airport agreed to allow Spielberg to film for such an extended amount of time, and this, if anything, adds a flow to the way the film is captured. But when the set is the best thing about a film, you know you're in trouble, and this is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's worst efforts.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","During a stop over at JFK Airport, Viktor Navorski finds that his homeland of Krakozhia has erupted into chaos and a military coup has taken place. This puts him bureaucratic purgatory because his passport is no longer valid, meaning he can't get home until Krakozhia's new government is officially ratified. Forced to spend his immediate future solely in the confines of the airport, Viktor shows tremendous spirit to survive in his totally alien surroundings.<br/><br/>The Terminal is loosely based on the case of an Iranian gentleman who was trapped in a French airport for almost ten years. Given the complete Hollywood treatment, The Terminal just manages to keep on the good side of good by fusing its fabled heart with a triumph of the will story line. Viktor {Tom Hanks perfectly cast} must use all his wits just to survive in this unique situation, be it a resourceful way of getting cash, a stoic drive to learn the English language from a simple travel guide, or making friends with an oddball assortment of airport personal, Viktor engages us as he goes about his merry way. The scenarios that are thrown up of course make for many a laugh, more so given that the said airport personal, played by Barry Shabaka Henley, Kumar Pallana and Diego Luna, are proper residents of America, but are actually equally as alien to the folk on the street as Viktor is!<br/><br/>In amongst the frivolity {which is great and very rewarding}, there's a question of how people treat people who are not English speaking? Perhaps director Stephen Spielberg wanted to make a point here about folk presuming that those alien to the language one speaks are cretins? Annoyances getting in the way of normality? Maybe, perhaps. It's certainly the impression I got from watching it on my latest revisit. Sadly the fun and serious angle is let down by the good old romantic strand that is wedged into a film that didn't need it. For sure Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful, but her character is weak and adds nothing to the film's basic structure. In fact it feels out of place, in the wrong airport perhaps? On the major plus side we have a wonderful performance from Stanley Tucci as airport commandant Frank Dixon, Dixon is a complete jobs worth, a stickler for the rules and views Navorski as a threat to the smooth running of his airport. If we discount the pitch perfect show from Hanks? Then Tucci most definitely takes the acting honours on show.<br/><br/>It's a very enjoyable film that has a couple of underlying veins of seriousness, it's just a shame about the tagged on romance forcing it out into pointless treacle territory. 7/10"

","The Greeks believed that, in order to become emotionally involved in a dramatisation that was clearly not reality, you had to 'suspend your disbelief'. Well, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed 'The Terminal', but I'm a romantic. If you're not, you're going to need a pretty thick rope to suspend your disbelief for this one. Eastern European Viktor Lavorski (Hanks) finds himself stateless and without citizenship when a military coup erupts in his country, during his flight to New York. As such, he is not admitted to the US, and must camp out in JFK. For months - during which time he gradually befriends most of the employees, and becomes a familiar figure shuffling around the terminal. At night, he teaches himself English by comparing the Russian and English versions of the same tourism guide, by the light of a miner's helmet which he wears to help him read. Always dapper and impeccably dressed - as we would be, if we were living rough in an airport - he soon catches the eye of air hostess Catherine Zeta-Jones, who asks him out. (I have spent many long hours in airports over the years, and never even SAW Catherine Z-J, never mind get asked out by her. Or, for that matter, by ANY air hostess. Which, incidentally, is their loss.) Anyway, in between his courtship by the alluring Miss Jones, he lays out a well-appointed apartment with bed and stereo in a corner of the building, builds a massive mosaic fountain within the terminal rest room, and wins the affections of practically all the staff in the eateries around the terminal floor. Not bad for an illegal alien with no English. See what I mean about suspending your disbelief? But hey, it's Hollywood. You can hang your disbelief on one of those big white letters up on that hillside. Once you do that - it's a fun movie."

After all, Viktor Navorsky's held our rooting interest through the entire film. Why shouldn't he (and we) get what we want? <br/><br/>And talk about supporting players...Stanley Tucci's Dixon is a wonderful airport administrator I loved to hate, and several of the day-workers, even some of the cops, who become his friends, make this a funny and sentimental fairy tale worthy of Spielberg's talents. The only downside is Catherine Zeta-Jones' character. As a romantic interest, she is so dysfunctional a person that I could not root for their romance to succeed. She is poison to Viktor, but he doesn't discover this until the end.<br/><br/>Still, this is a great film of discovery. Viktor discovers America from inside an airport terminal, we get a glimpse of a great character as he learns to understand our culture and communicate his needs.

","For a long time I avoided this film, quite irrationally reacting against the early hype in the way we all do sometimes. Then one day I saw it on cable when there was nothing else to watch, so I gave it a go. There is a pleasant joy about being proved wrong about a film, about the wry realisation that you have been stupid enough to delay enjoying a really interesting motion picture experience.<br/><br/>What happens is that Hanks and Spielberg do what they have done countless times before - individually and collaboratively - and draw you in. All they need is the ability to create believable characters in an interesting real-life situation and a setting we all recognise. Sounds simple. It's not. But this film plays like a masterclass in how to do it.<br/><br/>There is a lightness of touch about the film, exemplified by the incidental music and by Hanks' winning charm as the lead character who stays relentlessly positive in the face of the kind of un-feeling bureaucratic intransigence that is designed to wear people like him down. Despite all the odds, he never doubts that he is going to get into New York City, and so neither do we. And that spirit of belief that benign destiny will prevail slowly infects not only the rest of the airport, but the audience as well. To that extent, it's a 'feel good' movie.<br/><br/>There are some lovely individual touches too (watch out for when Viktor gets X-rayed - and then photo-copied!), and Stanley Tucci's turn as the uptight, officious airport security manager becomes a wonderful comic creation, without ever losing authenticity. But there are serious themes here too, and they are not smothered in saccharine - except perhaps in the last 20 minutes (when let's face it, it's acceptable). Spielberg's class allows the film to effortlessly dip between the tragi-serious, the laughably mundane, and OK the downright silly at times, without ever losing its pace or the logic of its simple plot.<br/><br/>There's not much more to say about this film without spoiling it. You don't need a deep understanding of international politics to understand it, just an interest in human beings and how they behave in reaction to the situations and people around them.<br/><br/>Watch it. You'll like it. And you'll never look at an airport terminal in quite the same way again."

","A fair number of reviewers in this forum have trashed this movie, including one who insists that its high score must be the result of blatant vote-loading.

If you didn't like the movie, it's fine to say so, but it isn't nice to disrespect people who did.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie; even where the plot doesn't hang together well, Hanks makes it work. He is utterly believable as an eastern European immigrant, and never steps out of character. Catherine Zeta-Jones' character isn't terribly bright, but she is quite believable. Stanley Tucci plays the pseudo-villain with deadpan panache. I've known all these people, and I recognize them here.<br/><br/>I don't expect films to make perfect sense, not to depict reality in every sense; I can stay home and experience reality.

"Okonh0wp","8","1","2","23 October 2005"," One of Spielberg's more lightweight projects, stays in place with style
","Spielberg can make a great story out of anything with his packages of sounds, sights, and story lines that elevate his work above that of mortal filmmakers. That being said, it's interesting to see him working his magic here on a story so devoid of movement. By that, I mean that compared to Jaws, Raiders, of the Ark or Schindler's List or even a more lightweight contraption like Catch Me if you Can, this isn't a movie where a lot of things happen. This is a slower paced movie that's really about the characters and the nuance of the arena and what more fascinating arena is there than an airport? On that level, the movie is meticulously crafted and sells the setting. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictitious country who through a bureaucratic glitch is trapped in John F. Kennedy Airport. It's based on a real-life story about an Iranian man who flew to Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport as the Iranian revolution occurred and found that the country listed on his passport was no longer in existence when he landed, and interestingly enough the man is still there. Historical accuracy is not this film's priority and for that matter, neither is any kind of realistic portrayal about the way an airport is run. The film is, more than anything, an abstraction: it treats the airport as not just the place we've all been through, an intermediary point on a longer journey; but as a state of mind as well. Because of that, unanswered questions about why Navorski's friends don't ever seemingly go home at the end of the day or how flight attendant Emilia Warren (Zeta-Jones) can have so much free time for a full-fledged romance on her layovers don't really need answers. <br/><br/>The movie surrounds its protagonist with a traditional nemesis in Stanley Tucci as by-the-book airport official Frank Dixon, a love interest (Zeta-Jones), and Chi McBride, Diego Luna and Kumar Pallana as various airport employees who serve as his entrouage. In some cases, particularly with Tucci's character whose actions are seemingly guided for no other reason other than to be the opposite of those of the protagonist, the film seems to be trying too hard to fit square pegs into round holes. In the end, however, the story ties together leaving you with a warm feeling that in this case is well-earned."

He shows off his huge talent playing the main role, a character that's in every single frame of ""The Terminal"". HE IS THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>So, what we got here is a perfect made movie where everything it's been so well cared (we're talking about a Spielberg production).

"TheNorthernMonkee","7","1","2","13 July 2005"," entertaining enough film with positive message
","SPOILERS Most people in Western civilisation have spent at least part of their life waiting at airports. Weather dependent, socially dependent and reliant of countless other variables, air transport is one long story of delays and cancellations. Based upon the story of a man living at Charles De Gaulle airport in France, 2004's ""The Terminal"" takes great pleasure in trapping a foreign accent voiced Tom Hanks in JFK Airport for a long period of time. Often entertaining and constantly reminding us of how life can be, this film is a pleasant experience with a positive view of life throughout.<br/><br/>Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is visiting New York for the first time. We say he is visiting, however after his home country is engulfed in civil war, his passport and right of entry is withdrawn. Now, fallen through a loophole, Navorski finds himself living in the International Lounge at JFK Airport, a citizen of nowhere.<br/><br/>Right from the start, ""The Terminal"" gets into the point at hand and introduces us to Navorski. Well played by Hanks, Navorski is a kind hearted foreigner with a mission to achieve. Unfortunately though, he is stuck in the airport, mainly due to the magnificently malevolent Frank Dixon (played with ease by Stanley Tucci). As Navorski settles into his new home, we are gradually introduced to a number of individual characters who are easy to watch and who grow on us as the film continues. Characters like Diego Luna's Enrique Cruz or Kumar Pallana's Gupta Rajan. All well acted and delivered, these characters are superbly written for the screen and thoroughly enjoyable tow watch.<br/><br/>There's little wrong with ""The Terminal"" actually. Decently acted, written, superbly directed, and with a good soundtrack, it fills all the necessary criteria to be a great film. Unfortunately though, it just never really makes it into the memorable films category. Perhaps the one main reason for this is that it's just too 'nice'. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's incredibly positive about everything it does, but it never feels gritty and never feels like it has much depth. It's an incredibly superficial film which will make the audience smile, but which will never really challenge us. If this is what the audience is in the mood for, then the film is worth watching, but if you want anything even slightly deep, then your better off elsewhere.<br/><br/>Together for the third time (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Catch Me If You Can""), director Steven Spielberg and star Tom Hanks are in part responsible for an entertaining film with a good heart. Often entertaining and well acted, ""The Terminal"" is a sweet little affair which will make you smile. Unfortunately for those wanting substance though, it is an incredibly superficial and shallow film. Never really showing depth or any sort of grit, it is a timely reminder of how films can be good in a mundane sort of way. Worth watching if you fancy being cheered up, but not the sharpest film around."
"vteditor","9","1","2","4 July 2005"," A different Spielberg Masterpiece
","From the moment you see the first couple of shots of the terminal that was built for this film, the way the lighting is so natural for an everyday place some of us would visit (if we are lucky enough) once a year, from the costumes on the actors and the hundreds of extras to the performance of the talented Tom Hanks.... you are drawn into a new Steven Spielberg. Not a futuristic haven for Action and Sci-fi junkies or a prehistoric nightmare of animatronics but something new that this viewer was not expecting. Spielberg's talent has taken a new path in creating a mock real world that at no point did i think was unreal. The pin point perfect Cinematography as well as the always superb editing by Michael Kahn (Must be attached to Spielberg's hip at this stage with the amount of films they have worked on) topped off this movie for me and gave me an evenings entertainment as well as a fresh respect for the 'berg'ster. If you haven't seen this movie I recommend a night in either with your significant other or even on your own and watch Tom Hanks introduce you to a waiting Victor."
"mOVIemAN56","7","1","2","1 July 2005"," I didn't really buy the romance but was truly fascinated by the rest of it
","The Terminal is another co-operation work between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is an Eastern European just arriving in New York. Just as he gets off his plane he learns that his country has broke out into civil war.<br/><br/>Viktor attempts to leave JFK Airport but is not permitted to go into the city or to get onto a flight home. Viktor must now wait patiently for the war to end so he may enter the city. Viktor takes up residence in an unfinished terminal while the newly appointed director of the airport Frank Dixon becomes ever frustrated by Viktor. <br/><br/>Viktor is able to find ways to get money and uses his skills to earn a job actually building the airport. As Viktor slowly begins to adapt to the store he befriends and interesting group of guys. One he helps to get a date with a security guard, another he plays poker with, and the third believes the man to be a CIA agent. Viktor begins to enjoy life in the airport but never forgets the promise he made to his father.<br/><br/>As Viktor lives and works there he becomes attracted to the flight attendant Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The film is truly a tale of how waiting patiently eventually pays off. Even though the film is highly intelligent and flows very well the romance I thought was not needed. I saw no connection between Viktor and Amelia.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks however brought the movie out of the dust. His acting job is fantastic and the heavy accent makes him sound completely different. Hanks does give one of his best performances of his career. The film is highly emotional at some scenes including the first day Viktor is stranded in the airport and the scene where he translates for the desperate immigrant with the drugs.<br/><br/>I thought the film is a bit updated version on Hanks earlier successful film Cast Away (2000) and is almost as good. I thought it was good. The end scene does get a little corny and the romance scenes aren't to strong but well thought out. The film has a good story, a good cast, and a strong message which made it very good.<br/><br/>The Terminal. Starring: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stabley Tucci, Chi McBride, and Diego Luna.<br/><br/>3 1/2 out of 5 Stars."
"mhajs","9","1","2","27 June 2005"," A masterpiece work of creativity.
","**** out of **** <br/><br/>While this may not be Steven Spielberg's best film, it's sure to be one of the best. Not only him, but Tom Hanks as usual are both magnificent. This movie is the true work of creativity, making it unique and so different from other theatrical releases. I enjoyed a lot watching this movie, and even my father who doesn't have habits at all to watch movies, had a seat and watched this to the very end.<br/><br/>The Terminal is the story about Victor Navorski, a traveler from a foreign country who needs to get a plane to New York. I won't spoil what he wants to do there, this is something which is only explained at the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. But something goes wrong and because of that, Navorski unfortunately can't leave the airport and enter the big city. Neither can him get a plane back to his country. He manages to live in the airport by doing many things which, of course, are very creative and fun to watch. But the only problem is that they're unreal.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie (which has been the only thing which made me not rate this movie with a 10 stars rating) is that at most times, it's very unreal. These are things you surely would put at the bottom of the list of things that are very likely to happen in real life. Sure this is a movie, a story, but sometimes it's almost so unreal, it almost makes us feel we're watching some sort of a fantasy in the present time.<br/><br/>Well, there's not much to say about this movie, without spoiling some stuff, so I'll quit it here. All I have to say is that this is a great movie, with great performances (specially Tom Hanks'), a great direction and great scenarios. Catherine Zeta-Jones is also as great in this movie as she's beautiful. You won't regret watching this movie. Just don't expect to see situations of everyday's life."
"flingebunt","5","1","2","9 June 2005"," Your terminated sucker.....it would have been better in French.
","Based on a true, and still continuing story of of Merhan Nasseri, and Iranian refugee living in an airport in France, this movie moves the location to New York.<br/><br/>Which is a pity, because because there story is too French to be true about America, especially in the current climate.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays another Forrest Gump type character. Victor is an innocent abroad, trapped in the International Waiting Lounge of New York airport because his country is having a civil war and his passport and visa are no longer valid (This is rather unlikely and the real story involves lost documents).<br/><br/>So there is the first mistake, we can't put ourselves in Victor shoes, so we can't share his fear and frustration. Can you imagine traveling in another country and losing your documents (I heard of someone being stuck in Russia for 3 months after losing all his money and passport).<br/><br/>Then the script is rather dull. There is a lot of potential, but why does airport security want to victimize him like that. France is a bureaucracy but America isn't. France will ignore someone, but America in the current climate is more likely to lock him up than let him roam around freely (law or now law, his is not a US citizen, rights don't really apply).<br/><br/>There could be a great battle of wits, a great love story a exploration of the farce of International law....instead it tries has none of these things and has very little.<br/><br/>It doesn't even make much of an effort to deal with the issues in America (Interestingly all the security people are either white or black with American accents, representing the false face of America, while the little people of the airport are all races and colours, all accents and represent the real America).<br/><br/>Not a bad film, but could be much more. I think the real problem is that Spielberg, with his minimal approach to story telling, fails to direct comedy well.<br/><br/>My final comment is that I was a stateless person for the first 10 years of my life. A movie like this should make everyone feel scared by letting them understand what this actually means. But in this it fails, so ultimately the movie is just 128 Minutes of very light entertainment."

","This movie is an absolutely excellent one. Why ? Because it reflects life and its difficulties with amazing psychology. I was moved by this story because I think that only if you ever were in a ""state of need"" you would resort to all the inner resources that make you a creative person. And so is the character of the movie. Viktor has everything against him : indifference, above all. Yet, his faith, his optimism, his commitment to a promise he had made, will surface the best of his qualities and make him a winner. His greatest victory is against indifference. His unwillingness to judge others is a sign of great maturity and spiritual depth. Viktor can be any of us, in a given difficult context. How would we react ? Screaming against injustice; taking out a gun and shooting; or accepting what we cannot change and actively trying an honest way out ? Spielberg and Hanks say the latter is the solution. This is what makes The terminal a great movie. One of the best of the year."

I suggest watching it twice, as I caught way more the next day (yea, 3-day rentals!).<br/><br/>While expecting just a quirky, sit-com-like film focused on the circumstances that might keep someone in an airport, there was way more going on. It has some great messages of self reliance and an incredible mirror showing the best and worst of human intention. There's enough humor and plot to keep this entertaining while a brilliant film sneaks past the viewer.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film I find myself quoting and using as a frequent reference.

","I don't ask for much in a movie. All I want is to care about the characters and what happens to them. That's all. Not every movie can do that, no matter how hard it tries. People wept while watching ""Big Fish""; I thought, ""If I were stuck next to Albert Finney's character on a train, I'd weep, too."" That is to say, I didn't care. Maybe I'm a hardcase, or maybe not; I wept at the end of ""Edward Scissorhands."" Go figure.<br/><br/>Now here is ""The Terminal"" with Tom Hanks in his most likable role, in my opinion, since Forrest Gump. Some have said he's TOO likable. ""The movie is too formulaic."" ""Too silly."" ""Sappy."" ""Too sweet."" ""Not up to Spielberg's best."" You know what? Not all of Spielberg's movies can be ""Schindler's List."" Or ""E.T."" What you have here is a movie that made me remember what it was like to have a good time at the movies and leave feeling good about the world in general. This movie was literally a breath of fresh air amid the noxious fumes of hate and war and fear that pervade our society nowadays. Too silly? What's wrong with a silly movie every now and then, AS LONG IT MAKES YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS? I don't mean ""Scooby-Doo"" silly; I'm talking ""Say Anything..."" silly.<br/><br/>I found myself caught up in Viktor's world and the friends he made in the terminal. I was moved when he explained to Amelia why he carries that damn peanut can around. I was moved again when Gupta selflessly provides a (possible) way for Viktor to leave the terminal. I found myself physically rooting for Viktor when he arranges a private dinner date for Amelia on the ""terrace."" What else can you wish for in a film? I have but one complaint. As moved as I was by his romance with Amelia, I didn't think it was absolutely necessary. The story was involving enough without throwing a love story into the mix. But Spielberg makes it work well enough that I didn't care too much.<br/><br/>All of this is to say: Do yourself a favor and rent ""The Terminal."" Unless you're an incurable humbug who thinks Spielberg should stick to war movies and nothing else, in which case this movie will do nothing for you. For everyone else, check it out. Come on. It'll be fun. Remember fun?"

","I couldn't understand how a plot about a guy stuck in an airport terminal could be good. I had the same feeling about ""Cast Away"" and it turned out to be a good movie. The question was, ""Can Tom Hanks pull it off again?"". The answer is a resounding YES! It works because the characters are so compelling and the stories are so interesting. The plot has plenty of levity, too. It makes a nuanced statement about the absurdity of bureaucracy without going over the top. Mostly, though, it is about the adaptability and resilience of some people.<br/><br/>I thought the writing and direction were exceptional. Cinematography was good as well, even though nearly all of the movie was shot indoors. I have one minor complaint. The antagonist in the movie started with some depth and progressed toward more of a two dimensional archetype. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, though and wasn't to the degree that is could have been.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie with exceptional work by the supporting cast. I highly recommend this movie."
"WalterFrith","Null","1","2","26 February 2005"," Magical intimacy
","Tom Hanks masters a European accent in this gem of a film that brings people together from different cultures who have one thing in common...preserving their humanity. Hanks plays the citizen of a country flattened in a brief war and he is now man without a country, a displaced person and is not allowed to leave customs at JFK airport and must stay in the terminal while bureaucracy plays itself out supervised by a self serving government official with political aspirations (Stanley Tucci). Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the apple of Hanks' eye as a flight attendant and Steven Spielberg's ability to keep himself grounded as a film maker with all of the success he's had over the last 30 years proves that he is not just a legendary film maker, but a regular guy as well."
"grahamsj3","8","1","2","21 February 2005"," A bit underrated
","Tom Hanks sure has a knack for picking the right scripts. Or perhaps Hanks makes the film. I'm not sure, but this is another Hanks success. This is the story of a foreigner who, while in mid-flight to the US, becomes a man without a country when his country falls in a revolution. He therefore does not now have a valid visa to enter the US, nor can he go home since he never actually entered the US. He is forced to live in the airport terminal. The film really doesn't give the viewer a sense of how long he's been there until, at one point, someone mentions 9 months! Hanks is befriended by nearly all of the airport workers and manages to survive very nicely through ingenuity after an awkward start. He falls in love with a flight attendant, the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones. Look for very good acting from the entire cast and a well-written story and screenplay. The only weakness I saw in the film was that his character, who arrives speaking very little English, seems to learn it fairly quickly. Then we find out how long he's been there, so it's not that hard to believe after all. All in all, an enjoyable film and well worth a watch."

In the Spielberg movie the ""stranded"" isn't an Iranian, but an east European citizen, who's country was the subject for a coop while Hank's character was in the air.<br/><br/>It might be provoking in it self that Spielberg & co. has taken what one might call LOADS of artistically freedom in this movie, and for me it is slightly provoking. This could have been a movie about a real person, a real suffering person that, even if the true Nasseri, has been given access to France currently, still lives at the airport, and his life are not a comedy, as Spielberg portrays.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Spielberg delivers a movie with the room for some softness and some laughs.

I thought the second half of the film suffered a little from becoming a bit over emotional, the love story seemed out of sorts and the way the entire airport staff seemed to know every thing about everyone else was a bit far fetched, I worked in an airport for many years and knew virtually no-one from outside the people I worked with on a daily basis, but maybe that's just me!

"rbverhoef","8","1","2","10 February 2005"," Delightful Spielberg comedy
","If there is one director who can lift simple entertainment up to a level most directors only dream of it is Steven Spielberg. The best examples are probably 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' and 'Minority Report', working with genres like horror, adventure and science-fiction that show events normally not seen in normal life. 'Catch Me If You Can' is a perfect example of a film about human lives that could go wrong in many places with a lesser director, but never does. 'The Terminal' has the same quality. Both films are based on true but unbelievable stories. A lot of films based on true stories go terribly wrong anyway, not with Spielberg.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, one of those actors with also the ability to make things better than they normally are, plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictional country arriving on JFK Airport. While he was in the air a coup was committed in his country and therefore the new government is not recognized and accepted by the US, therefore Viktor's country basically does not exist. That brings a little problem, his passport is not valid so he can not enter the US. Of course going back to a country that does not exist is quite impossible as well. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the customs official, tells him to stay in the International Arrivals Lounge until he is beeped and told what to do. Dixon is hoping he will leave and try to enter the US anyway so it is no longer his problem, but good guy Viktor obeys.<br/><br/>A solution to this problem is not easily found, apparently, so Viktor lives in the Lounge for a long time. In this time he befriends people, even starts loving a flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The Dixon character becomes the villain, sort of, although Spielberg makes him a real character with real grounds on which his actions are based on. Tucci finds the perfect note for this characters. There are some subplots, mainly to support Viktor's story, but they are handled with care. One of them in particular has to do with the guy who arranges the food for the planes, Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna). He loves the girl who rejects Viktor's request for entering the US every single day (played by Zoë Saldana) and makes a deal with Viktor. He gives Viktor food, Viktor contacts the girl and learns things about her. Of course these scenes are probably there to provide funny moments for Hanks, who plays his Viktor close to perfect, but the scenes never feel like that. They just play like they belong in this story and they happen to be funny.<br/><br/>All the little stories are played the way they should. Even the Zeta-Jones plot, one that seems obvious in what direction it will go, is handled in such a perfect way you keep wondering what will happen. That Spielberg is a good director and Hanks a good actor is a given. Here they prove it once again in a delightful comedy that plays, another impressive fact, on a very large set that looks perfectly like an airport. Yes, really delightful with a lovable leading character and a lot of lovable supporting characters in a feel-good story for everyone to enjoy, which is occasionally very funny as well."
"JimD73","7","1","2","4 February 2005"," The Terminal Takes Flight Due To A Spot-On Tom Hanks
","Plot: 1.5/2.5: Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is a citizen of Krakozhia, a country near Russia, who is travelling to New York. While he is in the air, his country is thrown into a coup, and is no longer recognized as a nation, for the time being. This creates problems for Navorski. He lands and the airport finds his passport is invalid. Airport bureaucrat Frank Dixon (Tucci) informs him that, because he is no longer a citizen of any nation, he cannot enter the United States of America. Also, he cannot go back to Krakozhia. He has fallen into a crack in the system. The only place he can go is the terminal in the JFK airport. This is the story of how he waited for his country to get out of hard times so he can finally step outside. Of course, it isn't just Navorski hanging around. He meets stewardess Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones), and they find, despite obvious differences, they are quite alike. He has numerous run-ins with Indian janitor Gupta (Pallana), who thinks Navorski is a spy. He also tries to get information for Enrique Cruz (Luna), who supplies Navorski with food in exchange for information on immigration officer Torres (Saldana), whom he is smitten with. He also has a need for money to pay for food, and needs something to do to pass the time.<br/><br/>The premise itself is interesting. Being stranded at an airport terminal uncertain of whether or not you'll ever go home, with Dixon being a great add-in. It could have made for great stuff, but unfortunately, it manages to screw itself over. The sideplots, for the most part, are utterly stupid. While I liked the bit about how he got a job and everything, the side plot about Cruz and Torres ends up exactly as we were hoping it wouldn't. I could hear a little 'LAME' echoing around in my skull. The sideplot involving Warren seems to be just a diversion to make the movie take up a full two hours, and Navorski's reason for going to New York is really half-assed. That being said, this does have a lot of heart to it. Navorski is an incredibly sympathetic character and Dixon is an incredibly unsympathetic character. If this movie had been 1 ½ hours instead, the plot would have been great. As it stands, it tries to do too much and branches way too far off course.<br/><br/>Comedy: 2.4/2.5: The Terminal is a very funny movie. It's not like it cracks jokes or anything, so it's not as gut-busting as, say, Meet the Fockers. It does have a sweet, pitiful humour to it, thanks mainly to some great set-ups and an out-of-the-park performance by Hanks. It does slow down at the end, but still holds up enough to make it very enjoyable, whether Navorski is getting hit by quarters or walking around in a bathrobe.<br/><br/>Acting: 2.5/2.5: Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) is absolutely incredible as Navorski. The accent is spot on, the mannerisms are spot on. Even the progression as he learns English is noticeable. This is the second time this year he's done a completely different voice (the first being The Ladykillers), and he once again nails it. Tucci (Big Trouble) is hilarious and great as the airport bureaucrat from hell. Zeta-Jones (Ocean's 12) gets a nothing character, but that's the scripts fault mainly. A special mention is in order for Kumar Pallana, who is hilarious as the obsessive janitor.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 2.3/2.5: This is the type of movie just about everyone can enjoy. Teenagers may say they thought it was too 'sweet', but in reality, they loved it. I can see people poking holes like it was Swiss cheese, but I doubt anyone will really see this movie and not leave with a positive feeling toward it.<br/><br/>Total: 87%: The Terminal is one of the best movies of it's type ever made. It's the type of sweet and kind movie that everyone pretends to be sick of but really likes a lot. Hanks deserves a lot of credit, as the weight of this movie falls almost entirely on his back, with only Tucci taking any other credit. I really can't see anyone having an overall negative view of this, so I recommend the Terminal to the world far and wide."
"Dolphinjoy248","7","1","2","6 February 2005"," Hanks runs the show in an enjoyable film
","The Terminal may possibly be one of Tom Hanks' best performances. True, it doesn't have nearly as much depth as the brilliant Philadelphia or the wonderfully moving The Green Mile. The Terminal is a simple film, based on true events. It doesn't sound like the most interesting film in the world; ""man gets stuck in airport"" doesn't sound very appealing, and basically that is the whole story, with a bit of romance thrown in for fun. But with names like Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks attached to it, The Terminal was always going to be a winner. Hanks plays Viktor Navorksi, who arrives in New York but then finds he isn't able to leave the confines of the JFK airport. There is a very moving scene when Navorski watches what is happening in his country on the airport monitors and is clearly very distressed. It's not all doom and gloom though, there are some great comedy moments, with Hanks delivering perfect comic timing, particularly in the scenes where the airport officials are explaining their rules and regulations. These are the best scenes in the film. I was in awe of how impressive Hanks was as Naborksi. Not for one minute do you not believe he is a pure bred Iranian, it is simply fantastic, with the accent spot on. Although the problem with Hanks being so good showed what a mistake it was casting Catheine Zeta-Jones opposite him. It is fair to say that Tom Hanks totally acted Zeta-Jones off the screen-and then some. That's not to say she is a bad actress(her Oscar for Chicago proves this). But when put alongside a pro like Tom Hanks, her inability and inexperience as an actress really shows. The chemistry between them is almost non-existent. There are a few tender moments as you watch an affection develop between them, but this is totally Hanks' movie and he carries it off superbly. It is mostly shot in JFK airport but is a lot more interesting than you might think, showing you just how much work goes into running it. The ending is very touching but you might switch it off having wanted a bit more. It won't go down in history as one of Spielberg's greatest efforts, but all the same it is a very enjoyable couple of hours."

","Good movie and good directing. Everything happens in an airport but you don't feel the disturbing closed, crowded, annoying side of it (Unless Spielberg wants you to). Tom Hanks looks like he doesn't act. He is like a guy from Krakozhia. The movie doesn't use the cheap way by making fun about the different culture (Like a lot of movies these days use the ignorance with a cheap fashion of fun making). Every movie has to have a bit of love in it so because of that they added the Zeta Jones's character which meant nothing because the character was not portrayed deep enough. Severe criticism goes to the immigration system. It is understandable. On one side you see an honest guy waiting on the other side you see the terrorists walking.... Fun to watch with the family."

"kennycbjr","7","1","2","13 January 2005"," The main problem with the movie
","Here is the main problem with ""The Terminal"": It doesn't know what genre to be. ""The Terminal"" could have been a funny human comedy, and at times it works well on that level. However, there are times -- because of the absolute absurdity and unbelievability of much of the plot -- the movie sneaks into allegory and symbolism. And that would be fine. At other times, the movie becomes a harsh, realistic satire on immigration and human nature. And again, it could have been a romantic comedy. Had Spielberg picked a genre and stayed, any of those could have worked, but as a hodgepodge of genres, it is strangely unsatisfying.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem is the amazing let down with the jar of peanuts. I was very interested to see what was in it, couldn't wait. ""What does Spielberg have in store for me?"" I kept thinking. Well, if you have seen the movie, you know how little drama or ethos was in the unveiling.<br/><br/>Great acting, great set (unbelievable, actually), interesting story, badly put together.<br/><br/>A low 7 out of 10, or high 6."

While she plays a character that is important to the plot, we don't see a lot of her and in the end the viewer is asking questions about her character.<br/><br/>All in all it's not a bad little movie. No heavy thinking required, it moves along well, and it has a happy ending, although not the ending I was expecting."

","I was very surprised of so many negative comments about the film. You can't expect everything to be true. Sometimes you just need to accept the story and go with it. The film is about Viktor Navorski (wonderfully played by Tom Hanks) who unexpectedly became stranded at JFK airport because the government of his country (made up country in Europe) was overthrown. Since the country no longer exists his visa to enter US got cancelled and all the flights back home were suspended as well. Not knowing what to do with him the head of airport security Dixon (played by Stanley Tucci) lets him stay in the airport until the situation is resolved. Viktor has very little English at first and does not grasp the situation. He has a goal to go to New York City to fulfill a promise to his father. As he settles in Gate 67 (which hasn't opened yet), he begins to learn how to survive. In the meantime, he befriends airport workers and even airport security. Being stranded in the airport myself, I can sympathize with Viktor. Even though the story is stretched a bit - living in an airport for more than 9 months is obviously impossible - it is still a very warm and at times funny story. Forget all negative comments and rent this film, you won't be disappointed. 10/10"

","Enjoy this combination of Castaway and Catch Me If You Can. It's a nice story, and sometimes we go to movies to escape reality, right?. If you're looking for reality, don't expect it here. Of course, no man is going to live in an airport terminal for months, nor will one take it upon himself to renovate a public facility on his own. Who cares? The portrayal of the head TSA bureaucrat was worth the price of admission. Who hasn't met a paper pusher who thinks he owns the world? I loved it right up to the ending. That was a bit of a letdown. Anyone who accuses the plot of being predictable is wrong. No one could have predicted what was in the peanut can, and what he was in the USA to do. I could have used a little more subtance there.

"howard.schumann","9","1","2","7 December 2004"," A playful, warm-hearted film
","In Steven Spielberg's The Terminal, Tom Hanks is Victor Navorski, a citizen of the fictional republic of Krakozhia who has come to New York on a personal mission only to learn that his country is in the middle of a revolution and that America is ""closed"" to him. Based on the story of an Iranian who remained at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris for twelve years, The Terminal is not a complex and demanding film, nor does it contain hard-edged social commentary but it has humanity, humor, and a great performance by Tom Hanks. He is ""everyman"", the little guy contending against the dehumanizing institutions of our modern world and Hanks' great screen presence makes him someone we can believe in and root for.<br/><br/>Viktor is a man without a country and must remain in the international transit lounge until things are resolved in Krakozhia and his nationality and visa status can be sorted out by rule-bound Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), JFK's Security Chief. While at the airport, he surrounds himself with an extended family of airport employees who, while wary at first, become eager to help. These include Gupta (Kumar Pallana), an Indian janitor who is paranoid about being deported, Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), a food coordinator who is in love with agent Torres (Zoe Saldana), a burly baggage worker (Chi Mcbride), and a flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whom he falls in love with. It is to her alone that he reveals the mystery behind the strange can of Planters Peanuts he carries around with him. At first unable to cope with the language and his confusing surroundings, Viktor gradually gets things under control. <br/><br/>He creates a private bedroom in an unused part of the building that is under construction and earns money by collecting quarters from luggage rack. After taking it upon himself to plaster and paint a wall, he is hired by a construction crew to work at the airport earning $19 per hour, a sum which keeps him well supplied with Burger-King Whoppers. Navorski, destined to remain at the airport for an extended period of time, learns to slow down, develop patience, and become aware of what is happening around him. Yes, The Terminal has flaws. It is too long, too neatly packaged, and, given the state of homeland security paranoia, its credibility is stretched pretty far. Yet at the end I felt better about the world than I have for quite a while. Consider me a sentimentalist but The Terminal is the kind of playful warm-hearted film that I can enjoy over and over again without feeling guilty about its lack of significance."
"ksk15","9","1","2","30 November 2004"," Pretend Flight Delays
","Terminal was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Although someone may not live in a not-in-use terminal, it shows what can happen in life. Viktor got smarter, and sadly, other people didn't like that. That is another thing-differences between me, you, and everybody. My favorite theme was probably how he lost everything, including his father, flew to NY, to finish what his father hadn't/ Love. That is another plot line. Also, how the flight attendent was included in the movie helped make is humouros, along with the serious points. And to be correct, I noticed that Viktor always never looked down in the move. For a newcomer, he wasn't scared of anything. To tell you the truth, this movie was really touching to everybody. Even if you don't believe in living in Terminals, it can happen, it really can."

Based on the true story of Iranian refugee Marhan Nasseri who lives at Charles de Gaulle Airport, this story is painfully rehashed for the American palate with a broken thermostat: ""If it worked for Castaway, it will work again."" Tom Hanks is stranded again this time in the world of bad cinema and becomes a ""crack"" in the system: he can neither go back to his Balkan home of ""crack""ozhia or enter American soil (except for moonlight dinners by the landing strip of course).<br/><br/>Our hero becomes messenger for an employee who ends up marrying a customs agent who has never met him but will marry him for the ring (airport women are that shallow) and proceeds to make a fountain for his love interest from airport urinals. The painful moment came when Zeta Jones asks Viktor ""you're living at gate 67, I just wanna know why?"" you can almost see her read her cue cards. Ouch. Hank's physical performance is Gumpian and his Krackozhian accent gets a bit tedious but he is a remarkable physical actor. Stanley Tucci is perfect as the Airport field commissioner but cannot stop Zeta-Jones from pairing up with older men. For Hanks fans. 2/10."

The former stars in this movie and the fact that he has played such iconic roles as Forrest Gump completely left my mind when I saw him in this role. Hanks put in a very convincing performance. He captured the humanity of his character and sold us on the idea that he is Viktor Navorski. It is a shame this movie did not do better business. Perhaps it should have been released this time of year. All the supporting cast is wonderful. There is foundation to the characters and characters are used to drive the story.

","Hello,<br/><br/>I am a Bulgarian-English interpreter from Massachusetts and it is not every day I hear Bulgarian in a movie (or on the street, unless I am in Sofia)! My husband and I got a real kick out of Hanks speaking Bulgarian - it would have been a little better if they had had him hailing from the actual country rather than a fictitious one. (Although a drawback to that might have been confusion over the war - most Americans are not familiar with current events in the Balkans and might think that, God forbid, Bulgaria was at war.) Although his accent was not perfect (for example, he routinely put the emphasis on the wrong syllable), that is really splitting hairs...how many actors would reember that mustard is ""gorchitza"" in Bulgarian?! Compared to other, fake sounding Hollywood Eastern-European accents, (the Russians in Rambo III; anything Dracula,) Mr. Hanks did an incredible job with a difficult language. Fun film overall.

","When renting the Terminal I was expecting a comedy, which it is not. It is a heartwarming comedic drama. First off Hanks has to be one of the most versatile actors in the business right now, he pulled off the role of Viktor perfectly. He brings such warmth to the character, he really makes him seem so real and lovable. The supporting cast deserves credit as well, all of these characters are so real and lovable. The humor is more subtle and will not entertain the younger crowd. But this is a film to watch with your family, its such a moving piece and very enjoyable. But what hurts the movie is that in some parts it slows down and chugs a bit, but you can forget about that. The other thing I loved about this was the writing, one of the better scripts that a movie had this year. The only people I see hating this movie are the cynics, and who really cares about them anyway?<br/><br/>For once I have a movie I can recommend to everyone, you will not be disappointed in this.

"Victor Field","7","1","2","25 November 2004"," I don't know when I'll be back again...
","Steven Spielberg has never made a bad movie (and yes, that does include ""1941""), but he has produced one or two - ""Joe Versus The Volcano,"" which was one of the first times he and Tom Hanks appeared on the same credit roll. ""The Terminal,"" along with being a change of pace from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" proves that they've come a long way from that leaden comedy and ""The Money Pit"" - but it's not a highpoint for either.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this is a loser; admittedly this movie does suffer from an inability to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama - the scenes of Tom Hanks' Krakhosian traveler viewing civil unrest in his country on the airport's TV screens sit uneasily with his gathering luggage carts for cashback, for a start. Plus the situation he's in is treated quite seriously, notably with the official who's the closest ""The Terminal"" has to an actual villain - played by Stanley Tucci, in the movie's best performance as an official who's a nice guy one moment and determined to get Hanks out of the airport at whatever cost the next.<br/><br/>This inability to find a proper tone is partly Spielberg's fault - he seems afraid of being accused of being too sentimental this time around, although if ever a storyline could have done with more emotional pull (not so much in the relationship between Hanks and flight attendant Catherine Zeta Jones* as with the reason why he's in America in the first place) this is it - but screenwriters Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson deserve more of the blame, especially the latter (whose questionable storytelling abilities also hobbled ""Speed 2: Cruise Control,"" ""Rush Hour 2"" and to an admittedly lesser extent ""Catch Me If You Can""). A distressing amount of subplots never seem to have a proper buildup or payoff (like the catering guy in love with Zoe Saldana), and a lot of it is too fragmented to have an impact; the climax and finale just don't have the effect they should.<br/><br/>The shame of it is that this movie is often perfectly watchable - finely acted, amusing and touching, and well shot and scored by Janusz Kaminski and John Williams respectively (not to give anything away, but music plays a key role in the movie). DreamWorks built an entire airport lounge for the movie (most of which was shot in Montreal rather than New York), but the good news about ""The Terminal"" is that it's not the sort of movie where you leave whistling the scenery. The bad news about it, though, is that you don't leave with much about it on your mind - worth seeing, but nothing about it lingers the way, say, Jennifer Garner playing Go Fish with Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Catch Me If You Can"" does. <br/><br/>This would make a great inflight movie.<br/><br/>*And the end credits finally prove that there IS no hyphen in her name."
"mcook128","8","1","2","11 November 2004"," Another Classic Hanks Performance
","Tom Hanks has a knack. Somehow he can take the most inane sounding plots and make them work. In Forest Gump, he made the story of a slow, idiot savante memorable. In Castaway, he spent an hour and a half on a desert island with nothing but a volleyball, and yet we sat through it. Now, he takes a story which takes place entirely within JFK Airport and makes it very enjoyable and entertaining.<br/><br/>This movie is not perfect, mind you. As much as I appreciated it, about 3/4 of the way through I definitely noticed that the movie had slowed. Not unpleasantly so, but noticeably.<br/><br/>Also, as much as this movie was billed as a Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones movie, it really wasn't. Tom Hanks was amazing, and while he was certainly enamored of her, there wasn't much screen time or much screen chemistry between them. Instead of sitting there wishing they could finally be together, you may find yourself wondering why he's even bothering. Yes, she's certainly beautiful, but what else is there?<br/><br/>All in all though, I really enjoyed the movie. All the actors turned in solid performances, and it was well scripted. Stanley Tucci and Hanks worked well off of each other and the supporting characters kept the movie flowing. The movie teaches you to have a little optimism in life, and make the most of a situation. Navorski gets a quarter for every luggage cart he returns and manages to have his own private feast from his rewards. <br/><br/>One final <glowing> remark for Hanks. Nobody else could have played that role. Any other actor would have either lost our attention from the beginning, or overacted it like a high school Shakespeare production. Kudos to Tom."

","The Terminal is the latest movie from Steven Spielberg and stars Ton Hanks, Catherine Zeta Jones and Stanley Tucci. In this movie, which is based on a true story, a man (Hanks) is forced to live in an airport he has just arrived in when political turmoil engulfs his country and his visa is revoked. What happens next is a funny mix of events as he tries to cope with his new home and the people around it. Along the way he encounters the cruel airport manager (Tucci) and a beautiful stewardess (Jones).<br/><br/>Well I think the highlight of the movie is definitely the performance of Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorsky. His great Eastern European accent really made him more believable plus of course his usually solid acting. I believe he really carried the whole movie. Stanley Tucci is felt also had a good performance. There is just something about this actor which makes him fit bad guy roles to a T. <br/><br/>What I found not very good about the film was the basic screenplay of the movie. Yes it was funny but not much in terms of substance. I also felt they could have shown more of the interaction between Viktor & Amelia. C'mon 20-25 minutes is definitely not enough. The sub-plots were OK but again perhaps less of that could have been included."

I usually find something wrong with any movie: point out plot faults, notice discrepancies etc. And I'm not saying that this movie was flawless. What I'm saying, is that this was the only movie that I have watched in a long while that I thought was, plainly put, 'amazing.' I don't really go to the movies, preferring to watch everything when it comes out on VHS or DVD. And when I do go, I only go once. This was the only movie ever that I went to see twice. It might be nothing to some people but to me it says a lot.<br/><br/>I think everyone should see it because I believe that it will become a classic as years go by. Inside this simple, seemingly predictable movie, is an inspirational and thought-provoking situation. We experience both joy and sorrow, unexplained fear and childish delight, as we follow Tom Hanks through his stay at the terminal. This movie speaks out to its viewers in a way that can not be described, just felt. I cried when I saw the movie - which says a lot as well.<br/><br/>I understand that people are entitled to their own ideas - that's the principle that I live by. But to name this movie as the worst, the baddest and the most plain is to do it greatest injustice. This movie has many lessons in it: one of them to never give up and, to quote Shakespeare, ""to thy own self be true.""<br/><br/>So, to finish this, I urge everyone to see this movie (and for those who didn't like it the first time - to see it again ;-)) and judge it not for its 'stupid' jokes and plain scenes, but for its deeper meaning."

It is becoming increasingly clearer that Tom Hanks is ascending to the ranks of our foremost actors today.

This is a perfect film for a date night. It has something for both the men and women. The comedy and lifestyle of Victor keeps the men there (not to mention Catherine Zeta-Jones) and the ""love"" story and plot keeps the women there. This was vaguely based off a true story about a guy in France I believe that did something similar. It's impressive to see the different ways Victor earns money and simply lives in the airport. I definitely would recommend this movie. Hopefully this will at least get Hanks nominated for an Oscar (even though I think he deserves to win)."

","I usually avoid seeing films while traveling, despite flying quite often over the Ocean. Cinema experience does not fit well for me with the poor sound, very small screens, and airplanes food. I could not resist however seeing 'The Terminal' both because the movie was presented by the airline before the DVD is out, and also because this is definitely The Movie to see in-flight. It's about airports after all, and I am spending nowadays part of my life on airports!<br/><br/>Well, I am not sorry at all. This is a typical Spielberg film, and with the exception of 'Schindler's List' here we have a film maker who cannot care less about credibility. His film making is about emotions, relationships, fears and monsters, and we have all of these in the film. The story is of an East European tourist, who finds himself stuck in the no land zone of a New York airport after his passport is being made valid by a military coup in his country. He is not allowed to enter the US, he cannot return home, or fly some other place. He became a non person in international law terms.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was for me the culture clash between the main character and the bureaucratic machine he needs to face. The message is that there is more humanity in his naive, East-European approach to life then in the government clerks supposed to represent the 'Western civilization'. America is an immigrant society, and this film tries to remind this basic fact. This is not supposed to be realistic life description, but more a symbolic confrontation, somehow similar to a Chaplin character facing the Big Machine. <br/><br/>There is no other word to describe Tom Hanks performance but perfect. A good supporting cast provides the comic counterpoint. There is not too much to say about Catherine Zeta-Jones. She is beautiful, and this is all what the role required. <br/><br/>This may not be one of Spielberg's best films, but even when he does an average film Spielberg succeeds to make it interesting, and in this case funny. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale."
"johnnyboyz","7","1","2","30 September 2004"," A good film overall but still rather weak in a few places.
","The Terminal is a good film that is funny, entertaining and deals with some good ol' fashioned drama situations. It felt very much like a documentary at times, maybe due to the fact it's based on a true story from the 1980's, but that didn't retract from the enjoyment factor. To say it's a story all about the trials and tribulations of just one man is perhaps a little too shallower way to sum it up but at certain times, you do wonder if the film's going anywhere. Such it is that the film DOES contain a few laughable moments adding to its comedy tag.<br/><br/>These come at certain intervals and everything in-between is just 'filla'. So there are some good, comic moments but in my opinion, there aren't as many 'funny' parts to make you laugh all the way through. The film deals with 'slapstick' humour in parts such as slipping over a wet floor or walking into a window. It's those sort of moments that do sort of distract from the film slightly.<br/><br/>Some of the stories within the film also feel generally annoying in the sense of the point of them being there. The film was supposed to be about one man (Hanks) I thought, NOT solely about anyone else and so I was rather surprised to see the little story about the food/cafeteria delivery worker attempting to get one of the other airport workers to fall in love with him. Things like that were flawed and distracted from the actual film. As I said before, that particular story line acted as a 'filla'; a way of upping the film length and it was disappointing.<br/><br/>Hanks' acting is good and although his accent was terribly annoying early on, I managed to adjust accordingly and with stand it all the way through. The character 'Gupta' is also rather amusing; using the simple concept of forcing people to slip up on his own polished floor merely for his amusement was rather odd- odd but funny none-the-less. Zeta-Jones' character and performance was also 'tolerable'. She wasn't in the film much I didn't notice but it's a good feeling when you realize Hanks has someone to really relate to as you stat to feel as if your feeling sorry for Hanks if you get into it too much and the acting from Zeta- Jones is some relief at least.<br/><br/>All in all I think you'll enjoy 'The Terminal' if you're the patient type. It's got a bit of humour, a bit of tragedy, a hint of romance and some moments where you'll really feel good for the characters as they finally get what they want after the last half an hour or so was probably built up to 'will it/they or won't it/they' not to mention the film itself on Hanks' struggle with staying in the airport."
"CurtMan@LVCM.com","9","1","2","22 September 2004"," Delightful, Heartwarming Entertainment
","""The Terminal"" is one of those films that anyone could enjoy: it has lovable characters, funny, cordial dialogue, and exuberant music, and it is a wonderful piece of entertainment for what it's worth. Tom Hanks is once again outstanding, boasting an accent so convincing that you literally forget it is Tom Hanks! His character, an immigrant from Kreckozia (or whatever it's called)is about as whimsical and delightful as characters come: he is simple (not too abstract), credible (in his dealing with the predicament he finds himself in), and laudible (his emotions are real, his happiness is real, everything he does is completely genuine). This is such a fascinating, if lamentable story: a man becomes stranded in an airport due to the termination of his home country which nullifies his legal residence anywhere, who ventures throughout the terminal trying to lead a normal, busy existence, while making friends and occupying himself. And what an execution! This is funny, genial, and amusing entertainment, featuring practically every element to contrive a delightful, hearty story. My only major complaint is the romance between Hanks and Zeta-Jones, which becomes overwrought as well as redundant towards the end. Overall, an interesting, delightful, and heartwarming film that reminds us that the greatest of things can be discovered in the most unlikeliest of places: in this case, a wonderful film, set inside an airport! ***1/2 out of ****"

","I think about 75% of everyone has missed the movies greatness. I know that starts off with a rather strong point but I find it very hard to believe why so many of you think that this movie is, and i quote ""lesser efforts..."". OH NO WHAT WILL WE DO THERE ARE NO SPACESHIPS, NO CG EFFECTS, NO PEOPLE RUNNING Across WATER AND KICKING PEOPLE IN THE AIR WHILE THE CAMERA PANS AROUND THEM. This movie is definitely one of the best movies out this year. What the movie industry is missing now-a-days are good stories with good acting minus everything else. You don't need to be the next matrix to be a good movie (ps those SUCK). Now i had this talk with people and they say, well lord of the rings had good cg along with story and acting - and well, yeah it does - however if you could have found 60,000 odd orcs looking for stand in roles for a movie, then the cg element would be totally dismissed would it not.<br/><br/>Stop being a stupid 14 year old whos movie sense is about as high ranking as a pineapple.

","I'm surprised to see this film scoring higher votes from a U.S. audience than an non-US audience, because parts of Viktor's experience are uncomfortably familiar to anyone who's ever been through U.S. immigration.  The unfriendly interrogation followed by an unsmiling ""Welcome to the United States"", the determination of U.S. officialdom to stick to the letter of the law, the need to answer leading questions in a certain way (""Have you ever been a Nazi? Are you a drug dealer?"" Yes, these questions are on the infamous light green form), and even the difficulty of figuring out how the public telephones work, all reminded me of my own experiences - and I speak the same language! (well, mostly :-)). So those people who criticised Spielberg for ""not knowing where the film is going"" are missing the point -- the true theme of this film, to me, is how outsiders see America, through the microcosm that is an airport terminal.<br/><br/>As for those people who criticised parts of the plot as being beyond belief, I have to agree -- I can't believe so many people slipped over on a wet stone floor in New York and didn't try to sue the airport (half :-))<br/><br/>[End spoilers]"
"silverkeys29","Null","1","2","12 September 2004"," The Terminal-- Fabulous!
","*This review contains no specific spoilers or citations from the movie itself, but does deal directly with the plot.*<br/><br/>The Terminal is a fantastic movie. However, it may not be the movie for everyone. It is more a ""film"" than a ""movie,"" as a movie is recognized now.<br/><br/>A movie usually has an identifiable (and frequently, a ""canned"") plot, wherein characters' behavior is dictated by the plot. For example, in a romance movie, the plot dictates that the characters WILL love each other by the end of the movie, no matter what monumental disagreements, tragic difficulties, or fundamental incompatibilities they must overcome in order to do so.<br/><br/>The Terminal, on the other hand, does not necessarily have a true plot. Oh, if you ask an unenlightened viewer what the plot of the whole movie is, you might be told, ""Viktor was stuck in a terminal. He wanted to go home."" But that's really NOT the point of the movie. The Terminal comes from a completely different genre of film-- one in which the point is not to present a complicated plot to entertain the short-attention-span audience, but to tell a story. In this case, it tells the stories not only of Viktor but also of the people he meets and interacts with in the terminal.<br/><br/>Without writing a whole paper on the movie-- which I could do very easily-- I will instead just point out again that this isn't necessarily the movie for everyone. On the one hand, I did find it very entertaining, and humor abounds. But if you're expecting a flashy, intricate plot, you probably won't appreciate it for the gem it really is.<br/><br/>I now randomly insert a general rule of thumb for judging movie taste: If you hate reading *literature* (note the difference between a shallow standard-issue novel and actual meaningful literature), then you're a MOVIE person. If you've ever read a ""real"" book, and understood it or appreciated its purpose, then you might enjoy in-depth FILMS.<br/><br/>For those who appreciate works of art, for those of you who fit into the second category listed above, read on.<br/><br/>Now, back to The Terminal to conclude: the actors, especially Tom Hanks' performance, are brilliant. The writing is beautiful and is very satisfying in that things do not always happen as you might expect. John Williams has done his usual superlative job of creating the perfect mood with his music. All in all, this is, as I have said, a true gem. I will be buying the DVD the instant it comes out, and it will hold a place of esteem on my own personal Top Ten.<br/><br/>IT IS INCREDIBLE!!!"

It simply touched my heart in such a way ..and like Spielberg himself said..He wanted to make a movie that would make people feel good about themselves,in these times of horror and dispair that are devastating our world. Nominated for an Oscar or not, this movie certainly deserves a chance, and whoever sees it, will not regret it! I personally love airports..Love to travel..And love New York!

","The terminal is a successfully funny and entertaining film. After reading a negative review on it, I was not expecting much from it. The plot has already been described, so I will refrain on it's elaboration. As far as the story goes, it is exaggerated, and in my eyes, a bit unrealistic, but boy did I laugh. Tom Hanks plays this eastern European so effectively, that I really started feeling sorry for him! On the contrary to other remarks, I feel the Indian fellow added immensely to the film's humor; I guess you have to have lived in New York to understand the behavior of a lot of the ""ethnic"" characters portrayed in this film. If you are someone that does not analyze a film to death, then please go see this movie. If you want to see a film that is uncomplicated and entertaining, please go see this movie.

It reminded me of those old frank capra movies, low key comedy, character based (cartoonish in parts!), but never really threatening. I wonder if anyone other than Spielberg and Hanks could make so much of the material. I won't see it again until the DVD release but I shall look forward to it just the same. . . . . ."
"iammatty","10","1","2","11 September 2004"," This film is beautiful...
","This film is a work of art, from beginning to end I loved the way Victor Neborski lived in the terminal... Even though I do not really like films based on true events that get the facts wrong, this one was great because not many people know that this is a true story. But when it really happened the man lived in the Terminal for 15 years. I loved everything about this film, especially the part at the end, it really makes you think that Victor has to go back without getting the autograph for his deceased father... But when he left the terminal to get the Jazz-mans autograph, Spielberg does a great job of doing exactly what the audience DOESN'T expect. Me, and my fellow viewers thought that the Jazz-man had died, or that when he told Victor to hold on for a minute, something would happen that would prevent him from getting the autograph... Great! 10/10"
"brownsea","10","1","2","7 September 2004"," The terminal is a must see movie
","Tom Hanks stars as Victor Navorski who has just arrived in New York city from eastern europe, whilst in the air the government of his home country has perished in the wake of a rebelion. Victor's passport is now invalid leaving him unable to return home or enter America. Leaving him with no choice but to live in the airport's terminal unable to speak any English.<br/><br/>The terminal from the start has a lot to live up to, being directed by the god like figure in the movies, Steven Spielberg, who over the past three decades has given us films such as Jaws, ET, Schindlers List, Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan. It also stars Tom Hanks, who in my opinion is one of the greatest actors of our time. Forest Gump, Cast Away, Saving Private Ryan and the Green Mile are films that really standout in my mind. With this mixture of talent you would be expecting something special and that is exactly what the terminal is, something special.<br/><br/> From start to finish in the terminal you can not help but to be drawn to the character of Victor. Tom Hanks gives a standout performance that will touch the hearts of all viewers as he brings the character of Victor to life. Hanks is able to evoke so much humour and emotion from this character that it really makes the terminal a must see.<br/><br/>It would be wrong to say that Hanks is solely responsible for making this film what it is. The support cast of Stanley Tucci's Immigration and security chief who can't do enough to try and get rid of victor, is excellent as always, in a role he seems to relish. also at hand are, Catherine Zeta-Jones, a stewardess who passes through the airport frequently, whilst passing through she meets Victor and then some what frequent encounters between the two begin to happen, gives an enjoyable performance. Kumar Pallana gives a very funny performance of a floor cleaner who loves to see unsuspecting travelers fall flat on their faces as the result of slippery floors.<br/><br/>The terminal is a touching and very funny story that will keep you gripped on watching victor adjust and deal with his surroundings and his interaction with people that he meets. Victor manages to touch the lives of so many that he meets in the terminal that it keeps the story rolling along at a nice pace and at just over 2 hours doesn't make it seem too long. The set itself, Spielberg had a complete terminal built from scratch, is fantastic and makes you feel as though you are caught up there with the characters.<br/><br/>This is a film that I feel is a MUST SEE, even if it is not the sort of film you'd go for."

So what if the authorities would have arrested Viktor and put him in jail at the outset? So what if this is the most unbelievable story ever? Movies are SUPPOSED to take us away from REALITY and to take us to a fantasy world where we can forget our troubles for just a couple of hours.<br/><br/>IT'S A MOVIE!!! for God's sake.<br/><br/>I personally was transported to another place. I was transfixed by Viktor's plight. I was on the edge of my seat when he might have got the girl and I almost cried when he didn't. I was horrified at the lengths that the airport official would go to in order to stop Viktor from entering New York!<br/><br/>The sets where good, the acting was good, the comedy was good, the story was good and overall the movie was GOOD!<br/><br/>If you are thinking of seeing this movie then DO NOT analyze it, DO NOT take everything that is said in this thread to heart and DO NOT believe the sad people who prefer reality to fantasy."

The Terminal is a place that becomes more of a home and a place to work for Viktor Navorski (Hanks). He gets stuck because of the war and in this terminal he finds love and he discover things among people he did not believe. Coming from an eastern-Europe country to USA he also fulfil his father's last wish. The Terminal is a delight in many ways, a must see, definitely!"

","My wife and I feel that this is a marvelous film with the potential to become a classic. Tom Hanks is, as always, superb with an outstanding supporting cast. He is certainly the premier cinema actor of these times. The script portrayed every type of character that we could possibly encounter in any situation dealing with bureaucracy. Besides the person Hanks played there are all of the prototypes which we seem to envision in our daily lives. My favorite was the chief of US Immigration at JFK. We have all encountered someone like him more than once. It a great story which was beautifully filmed, wonderfully produced and overall a winner. I would recommend 'The Terminal' to anyone.

When you find the reason why he always carry the peanut cann and why he keeps staying at the airport, you absolutely cannot help encouraging Viktor!<br/><br/>The acting was great and makes you laugh, smile, or weep throughout this movie. Especially the misunderstanding parts (Viktor is Krakozian and is not able to speak English.) is very funny: not only the way he talks but also how the other people try to have him understand his situation.<br/><br/>The camera work is pretty good. It is very natural and makes you feel that you are a part of that movie sometimes - but it always show how each character in the movie feel. For example, the camera focuses on Viktor at a loss and move backward to show the whole people in the airport. This can make you sense how he felt segregated and helpless, even though there were so many people around him."

","I have to admit this story drew me in.  There is a lot about the movie that made me go, ""Wait a minute..."" but all in all, it was a good story and I was able to overlook many of the sillier events.  Tom Hanks is so good that I kept forgetting that he's not really an Eastern European.  I had read that his accent left something to be desired...I don't agree.  I do that that Catherine Zeta-Jones had a distracting accent, however. Sometimes she sounded like she had a slight southern twang and other times that was absent. This was a largely character driven story, and I thought that all of the actors did a great job.  I cared about the airport employees--and Stanley Tucci had us laughing so hard at what a jerk he had to be.  I didn't find it slow at all...maybe just a bit more quiet.  It's not slapstick, although there's quite a bit of slipping and falling on a wet floor, if that's what makes you laugh (I have to admit I did laugh at the people falling down...).  Not the best movie I've ever seen, but not horrible as many reviews have complained.  I recommend this one to those who enjoy a good story."
"fred_doeslaugh","Null","1","2","14 July 2004"," I don't walk out of movies...this was an exception.
","OK, when you first hear about the concept of this film, you might think that it's an ideal notion about the still on-going bureaucracy in America and you're right, it IS a novel concept. However, right off the bat I wasn't totally buying it. In the beginning the Stanley Tucci set-up of the plot just seemed a little too forced. I felt like after he explained to Hank's character WHY he had to stay in the airport due to his falling into a ""customs limbo"", Tucci could very well have just turned to the audience and remarked, ""and that's the premise, folks....see?!?!"" And that's another thing....does it take so very long to get an interpreter for this poor guy, i mean it IS an international airport is it not? And in this post 9/11 world of tight airport security, why does he get to roam freely around the complex and set up ""camp"" without Federal Marshals even batting an eye? Tucci IS a homeland security official, right? (or at least that's what the sign says on his office). Not only does he allow this but his officers stand around watching him on monitors while possibly Richard Reid types could be pushing around a shopping cart of dozens of explosive Payless shoes....not to say that Payless is responsible for shoe bombing, it's just that that company is one of a myriad of product mentionings or placements, ranging from Burger King to Borders to whatever. Of course it's an airport, a convenient setting for rampant product placement anyway. But seeing that I have to now watch a slew of commercials before the previews and it costs me 9 bucks for the privilege, enough is enough. <br/><br/>OK, back to the film itself: Catherine Zeta Jones was out of place at best. The 30-second crying jag wasn't totally believable. You find yourself watching Hanks being resourceful and adorable until you can't stand it anymore. Hank's airport limbo seems to rely for the most part on the unrealistic ability of Tucci's character to be so faithful to the rules in some areas and disregarding in others. <br/><br/>Of course, I can't really go on about the plot, seeing that i did indeed walk out of this film, something that i never do, dear readers. Maybe everything WAS tied up nicely in the end and my heartstrings could have been tugged so much that I would need surgery and that Forest, Capt John Miller and Andrew Beckett would kneel in homage to this new character, but i doubt it. Wait for it on HBO."

Or you try to explain yourself the best you can and it does not work.<br/><br/>Most people think that immigration is easy. Not it is not. I am a resident now but before I had to ask for a visa. I went to the embassy every time and when you come in to the United States you better state your purpose in USA because it can give you problems if you for any reason you get engaged in illegal conduct or business.<br/><br/>When you come in and talk to the officer is really hard sometimes. Because you don't want to sound stupid or say the wrong thing. You think you don't know where are you going. You are going to see mickey mouse in Orlando. You got your plane ticket which usually they ask. They want to see that you are going back to your home.<br/><br/>Have you ever stuck in a country where you have no money and have no debit credit card. This is an new concept. where you can use your debit visa card. Before you would be stuck and maybe the airlines would help you get back home.<br/><br/>Anyways, I enjoyed it very much. All characters were believable. But remember, this is a movie, certain elements are needed for entertainment purposes. This movie has Spielberg written all over it. Camera movements. Camera position with various characters. Certain jokes. Check when people are running back and forth on the background. This is the mind of Spielberg.<br/><br/>By the way, this is based on a real character. According to the interview with Hanks. The real Victor decided to go back and live inside the terminal again. He did not get used to the outside. This is not a spoiler.<br/><br/>This is a film that takes a look at real airport life in a funny way. Usually we don't see these people.

His papers are no longer any good, so he can't go to New York and he can't go home.<br/><br/>The story is about all the lives he touches during his time in the terminal- from a flight attendant with a skewed view on relationships (Catherine Zeta Jones)to a man wanted for assaulting a police officer in India (Kumar Pallana, who, by the way stole the show for me!!)to the Homeland Security Chief (Stanley Tucci) who he teaches that people mean more than rules and regulations.  He even acts as cupid to a wayward couple (Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana).  <br/><br/>I think it was Walt Disney who coined the term ""Plausible Implausabilities"". Basically what it means is taking something you patently know can't happen and make it believable.  It's been used in cartoons for decades.<br/><br/>Speilberg perfect for live action here.  If you look too long at the plotline, you will see that it just couldn't really happen, and yet...<br/><br/>There are plenty of feel good moments, some really tense moments, and a wonderful ending.<br/><br/>Four stars out of four!"

It's not Viktor's fault -- there's been a coup in his country -- it's just a bizarre bureaucratic nightmare and he's stuck at JFK -- for months. <br/><br/>Stanley Tucci plays the mean-spirited arrogant US Customs Official who's more interested in his own promotion than in showing a measure of kindness and compassion to Viktor.<br/><br/>Viktor meets a guy who works for a catering service, and he's willing to give Viktor some food, but only if Viktor gets info on a cute girl the catering guy is in love with. The fact that Viktor has no money to buy food and has been treated appallingly by the US Customs Dept isn't reason enough for the catering guy to help. No, he'll only help if there's something in it for him.

This movie is touching and funny in all the right places. It is a tribute to the craftsmanship involved in making this movie that Catherine Zeta-Jones has to take backseat, but her acting was delicately understated. <br/><br/>There is no question that Tom Hanks is a fine actor, but he creates this character in such a believable way that the audience easily forgets that he is Tom Hanks, a face we all can recognize, and begins to see him as a foreign man. He gives us an intelligent and compassionate character that we can immediately sympathize with.<br/><br/>In such a character-driven movie, the protagonist is almost as important as the antagonist, and Stanley Tucci in the role of Frank Dixon hardly slouches there. Though his motivation is clear from the beginning and he never strays from a normal human character, I found myself whispering curses at the screen whenever he showed up to make Victor's (Tom Hanks) life just a little more difficult. <br/><br/>There are sweet moments, such as when the hard-nosed INS officer and the man who runs the food truck use Victor as a go-between in a blind love affair. There are heart-wrenching moments, like the very beginning when Victor sees news coverage all in English that tells of the war in his country and struggles to understand. All in all, a movie I would recommend to almost anyone able to see it."

","The new Tom Hanks-Steven Spielberg collaboration ""The Terminal"" is everything that you'd expect from these two. A straightforward plot, a clear cut hero's, villains, and conflicts, an an ending that doesn't fall into cliché, but isn't enough to run to the cinema for. What saves the film from mediocrity, though, is another virtuoso performance by Hanks and good supporting turns by Zeta-Jones and Tucci.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, The Terminal is the story of Viktor Navorski. A man who, after his fictitious country is overthrown in a military coup, is forced to live in an airport terminal by the methodically by-the-book Frank Dixon (Tucci). As Navorski tries to escape from the terminal, he makes friends both of those inside the terminal and of those passing through (Zeta-Jones), all the while proving to everyone around him that compassion is reason enough to travel around the world.<br/><br/>Hanks has been a mixed bag with his accents, but his Eastern European as done by Navorski will certainly garner him another Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Spielberg doesn't do anything spectacular here, but he manages to give the terminal a life of itself. From the running shops to the pictures of Viktor's hand prints after a touching scene, Spielberg once again immerses the viewer in a world that makes them wantto pay attention. His standard work, but his standard would be the best of other's careers.<br/><br/>All in all, The Terminal is a nice break from summer explos-athons, but it's nothing to write home about- 6/10<br/><br/>Line of the Film- ""He really loves that goat.""-Navorski<br/><br/>Look of the Film- Navorski as he closes the Planters can at the end of the film."

","I had my doubts when I went to see this movie. Come on I thought, how exciting could a flick that has the title ""The Terminal"" be? What could possibly happen inside that terminal in the space of two hours to pry the story from the hands of inescapable mediocrity.<br/><br/>Well, I must admit I was wrong. Granted the premise of the plot is somewhat weak -- Viktor Novorski (Tom Hanks) ends up being stuck at an airport terminal for a few months while civil war rages in his native Krakozia (Bulgaria). That little detail aside, everything from the powerful story line, to the spectacular acting by the entire cast without the help of fancy special effects or eye-catching scenery, works together to create a monumental movie. <br/><br/>There were so many powerful themes intertwined throughout the story. One of them is that any human being, no matter how normal, when put into a strange environment, would seem weird and out of their element.<br/><br/>The other, is pretty groundbreaking -- that always following the rules is not necessarily the same as doing the right thing, or doing good.<br/><br/>The strength and uniqueness of the movie comes from the fact that somehow Spielberg and Hanks manage to convey these powerful ideas [and many others] through the eyes of Viktor Novorski -- a man who barely speaks English.<br/><br/>I rate the storyline a ""B+"", and award an ""A+"" to Acting, Direction and Visuals (there was no need to use special effects to make up for a weak story or acting). Overall, even though Ngorski didn't bag the babe, I still give the movie an ""A+"". The last time I saw anything in the same league was ""Good Will Hunting""."

I sat down to really enjoy this movie and found myself increasingly frustrated throughout the film. This movie doesn't attempt to be fiction which is the source of my issues. It attempts to show us an extremely unlikely (yet possible) situation where a man is stuck between two countries at an airport terminal, but where it fails miserably is in the handling of the situation. I grew increasingly frustrated by the ways in which this ridiculous situation were played out. I never could suspend my disbelief of how ridiculous the whole scenario was and throughout the film I could not enjoy the laughs that came. I found myself mumbling out of frustration and heard many others in the theatre speaking out loud at their own disbelief of how the movie played out.

","I walked into The Terminal expecting a light comedy with a romantic twist. While being all that, it turned out to be a intricate, deep movie about human nature. While people try to come into the US to make their lives better, by any way possible, Tom Hanks plays a character who follows the rules. Stuck in the JFK terminal due to the fact that his own country ceased to exist while he was in air. The movie is strong due to the realistic performances by everyone involved in the process. It was funny at times, but mostly it just presented the innocent characters on a platter. There were some scenes when people around me couldn't stop laughing, while I was touched. It is an awesome movie with great performances. Tom Hanks has another Oscar coming his way!<br/><br/>10/10"

It's one of those movies that you know is going to improve every time you see it.<br/><br/>I think what makes this work so well is the depth of every character in it. They're all three-dimensional. Even the antagonist, the security manager, comes off as a real person with real and valid motivations.<br/><br/>Hanks gives a spectacular performance in what has to be an extraordinarily difficult role. Stanley Tucci as the security manager was also brilliant, worth of Best Supporting Actor. <br/><br/>A note on the rating. The MPAA has declared themselves to be totally useless with this rating. PG-13? Are they nuts? I'm a pretty stuffy moralist, and this movie should be rated ""G"", suitable for general audiences. No violence. No profanity. (You think there is, but it's just your dirty mind.) No T or A. (Though does CZ-J really need to take her clothes off?) It's no racier than ""Casablanca"".

","POTENTIAL SPOILERS<br/><br/>Hi. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot, but I felt that some of the story's loose ends could have been tied (that fountain that Hanks built had to explode when they were kissing!) and some parts of the ending either improved (why exactly did Tucci have tons of pills in his desk or not get fired earlier for his treatment of Hanks by the copy machine) or clarified. Below is my suggested alternative. I'd love to know what you think---scottfeinberg@hotmail.com.<br/><br/>Alternative Ending for The Terminal (2004):<br/><br/>Tom Hanks leaves the airport, as he does in the film, with the help of the black customs agent who defies his superior, Stanley Tucci. He gets to the Ramada Inn where he is seeking the signature from the last person remaining from his father's old band. He gets there, only to be informed that the man has just left for a flight to tour in Europe. So Hanks, exasperatedly, must turn around and head back to the airport and certain deportation, in the hope of catching the band member before he is caught himself. As he re-enters the airport and tries to evade detection, he rushes around and searches, albeit unsuccessfully. He hops onto an elevator, and as it reaches the second floor and the door opens, he is greeted by Tucci and a sea of security who grab him, telling him sternly, `Mr. Navorsky, we're gonna need you to come with us.' He seems dejected as Tucci walks him through the airport, escorted against the traffic of travelers who have been cleared and are leaving the airport. Tucci then tells Hanks, `Victor, someone's been waiting to see you,' and he points out Zeta-Jones holding a sign with the limo drivers that says, `Victor' and then she shuffles to a second sign and says, `I'm sorry,' and then heads to a third sign that says, `Forgive me,' and then a fourth sign that has an arrow pointing to the right. A man steps out of the crowd, looks at Navorsky for a second, then smiles slightly and says, `Mr. Navorsky, my name is [band member]. Nice to meet you.' Roll credits."

","I have never been much of a Spielberg fan.  His most popular and his most acclaimed films did not do much for me but his last 3 films, including The Terminal, has changed my mind.  <br/><br/>The Terminal might be Spielberg's most human film to date.  I thought it was very funny and the characters did not rely on cliches.  The style of this film harks back to the days when you could not always count on a Hollywood ending.  I think that is why so many people were disappointed.  If the film ended the way of most Hollywood films, then people would be complaining about how predictable it was.  <br/><br/>Also, many critics are complaining about excessive product placement.  The movie takes place in an airlines terminal.  The people who are doing the complaining are not giving suggestions on how not to have name brand products in this type of setting.  It would seem to be unavoidable.<br/><br/>This film is funny and sentimental. So far, this is my favorite movie of the Summer!  9/10"
"gregsrants","8","1","2","20 June 2004"," Endearing. Spielberg scores again!
","`Welcome to America, almost' <br/><br/>That is the line uttered by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) to the recently arrived Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) in Steve Speilberg's new film The Terminal.  <br/><br/>The film, set almost entirely in a New York airport, tells the story of Victor's attempts to gain entry to America after his European nation goes to war while in transit leaving him without a recognized country or visa required to enter Stateside.  Standing in his way is the incredibly self-serving Frank Dixon who wants nothing more than for Victor to leave the airport, thus leaving him in the hands of federal officials.  But as days pass without Victor taking various bait as laid by the airport brass, Frank's nemesis becomes his crusade and to the bitter end he is determined not to let Victor get the better of the unfriendly rules and regulations he strictly enforces. <br/><br/>As days turn into weeks, Victor befriends various workers within the terminal including an Indian man who enjoys over-waxing floors to watch travelers slip to his amusement and a young airport employee that trades Victor food for information on a young INS agent he has intentions of asking out.  Victor soon uses these friendships to his advantage after meeting a beautiful flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is self-admittedly bad with men and looks to use Victor as a stop over conversation aide to hide her grief in her own decision making abilities. <br/><br/>
Under the watchful eyes of the airport cameras, Frank watches some of these events unfold including Victor's luck at getting a contract job with an airport renovating crew.  Not knowing how to rid himself of Victor's reluctance to leave, Frank does everything from threaten those that are closest to Victor to overtly lying to Victor giving him a false impression that no persecution will occur if he leaves the airport at a certain time of day.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg based on a screenplay written by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), The Terminal is one of those wonderful films that requires you to suspend belief in a situation too unbelievable to be true, but too magical to be ignored.  Tom Hanks is particularly believable as he puts on his Meryl Streep hat and nails an accent that if not handled properly could have been if not embarrassing, definitely distracting.  By mixing his new linguistic talent with stereotypical European hand gestures, Hanks is endearing and completely engrossed in the role of a foreigner that goes through an incredible transformation including using his time in the airport to learn how to read, speak and understand the English language.  <br/><br/>But as a perfect compliment to Hanks tenderness and naivety is the evil Tucci who in terms of Spielberg films, outdoes even Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List and Danny Glover in The Color Purple as the most cruel and ruthless villain that he has ever tried to put on screen.  Tucci as Frank never waivers from his intentions and his tunnel vision geared towards what he hopes to be an inevitable and well-deserved promotion.  It has been a long time since I have watched a film and actually hated a character for their actions towards an innocent bystander, but Tucci delivers a knockout punch that should be reviewed again when nominations for little gold statues come out later this year.<br/><br/>I did make a mistake before seeing The Terminal in that I read other reviews before actually previewing the movie myself.  Although most reviews have been more than favorable, local papers designated the story as unbelievable' and therefore underwritten'.  Huh?  A movie brought to you by the same director who has endeared us with dinosaurs and aliens has made a story that is insupposable?  The notion of a man living inside a terminal for months is possible and then should be based in a more realistic situation?  Pleee-eazze!  What is more believable than a man looks to fulfill a journey as set out by his father (I have to leave this one in an enigma to hide what is really a touching reveal and ending to the film)? <br/><br/>
The Terminal is another notch for the belt that is Speilberg's legacy. Sure, the brilliant films of Schindler's List, Jaws and Saving Private Ryan are arguably better, but if Stevie decides he wants to spend the rest of his life making 4 to 4 ½ star movies then the movie going public should continue to bow in thanks for all his contributions.  <br/><br/>A strong recommendation is therefore granted and a longing for Spielberg's next attempt at celluloid.  For any director than can keep us in a movie theatre for two hours making us yearn to stay in an airport terminal longer is a craftsman of remarkable talent.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

I'd never think about referring to airport doors as an entrance to a city--as opposed to being, well, just an exit of an airport--or find a better justification for why foreigners or new immigrants in ""the promised land"" (welcome or not) could still be so attached to their home countries...even if (or maybe especially if) the latter is teeming with political and economic problems.<br/><br/>And, of course, slipping on wet floors is always funny.<br/><br/>Yeah, it IS highly unbelievable that a person could get stuck in an airport terminal for months, but I think that the feeling of being stuck in a certain time or place where Starbucks coffee and saltine crackers become a sort of staple food (figuratively, of course) is strangely familiar to most people. :)<br/><br/>I've been trying to compare this movie to others I've seen, but it just won't work.

","Steven Spielberg says he wants to lay off the heavy stuff for a while and do some comedies.  ""The Terminal"" is a terrific step in that direction with stars Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci turning in outstanding performances in a story that easily might have fallen semi-flat. (It's actually a drama/comedy by the way.)<br/><br/>Hanks is Viktor Navaski who arrives at JFK (not really-it's a great mock-up) from his native Krakozhia only to find that his entry is barred because revolution has toppled the government, the U.S. has not recognized the new regime and the second-in-command of security for the international building, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) won't let him leave the place. Dixon has a potted view of immigration law on his side.  The virtually non-English-speaking Navaski needs to get to Manhattan for a reason only disclosed near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>What follows is a wildly impossible tale of a guy who spends about nine months in the terminal, making friends, learning English, getting a paid-under-the-table construction job and enjoying a troublesome dalliance with Amelia, a beautiful but definitely mixed up flight attendant.  That's Catherine Zeta-Jones, radiant and captivating as ever.<br/><br/>Navaski becomes friends, in a mutually dependent way, with an assortment of airport employees, each a lovable stereotype.  His relationship with Dixon becomes increasingly adversarial.  Dixon starts off as a typical bureaucrat whose underwear is two sizes too small but as time passes and he seeks promotion to top honcho, Navaski being viewed as a possible impediment to his advancement, a streak of pure meanness emerges. And Tucci is great as a truly little man in a job much too big for him.<br/><br/>Much but, happily, not all of the plot is predictable.  There are a lot of good lines. And a couple of surprises at the end.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Terminal"" work?  Very fine acting by the three main characters is one reason and the supporting cast is good too.  Hanks is amusing but also believable as a guy unfortuitously in the wrong place at the wrong time - at first.  The hint of a flowering relationship between Navaski and Amelia is, unusually for a story like this, quite adult.<br/><br/>Special kudos go to Hanks's dialog coach.  The star's Krakozhian accent is flawless.<br/><br/>John Williams won't garner an Oscar for this score but it's a nice one.<br/><br/>This film approaches the Holy Grail for product display and screen marketing.  The terminal has all the shops one would find at a real aerodrome and no opportunity is wasted.  Every major chain - books, food, electronics, clothing, you name it - seems to be represented as is United Airlines (since there's no humor about crashes or hijackings they felt safe, I guess, having their logo everywhere including on flying machines).<br/><br/>I thought before seeing ""The Terminal"" that it wind up being a ""6"" or possibly even a ""7"" but in fact it's a <br/><br/>9/10.  Thanks Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Hanks, Mr. Tucci and Ms. Zeta-Jones for making two hours in a movie theater on a hot, humid day speed by rewardingly.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the special features on the DVD release."

","Review of THE TERMINAL<br/><br/>by STEVEN BAILEY<br/><br/>If Charlie Chaplin was still alive and creating, it's easy to imagine<br/><br/>him making a light comedy as richly satisfying as ""The Terminal.""<br/><br/>Just as Chaplin used to take a prop and wring every possible gag<br/><br/>out of it, Steven Spielberg's prop is a New York airport terminal<br/><br/>from which he extracts every story possibility. And Spielberg's<br/><br/>Chaplin is Tom Hanks, who takes a potentially show-offy, Meryl<br/><br/>Streep-type role and turns it into a movie character for the ages.= Hanks' role is Viktor Navorski, a European immigrant who<br/><br/>becomes a modern-day ""man without a country"" when his native<br/><br/>land gets embroiled in a revolution. Viktor can't return home<br/><br/>because his country is under siege, and he can't legally enter New<br/><br/>York until his country's new leadership is recognized by the U.S.<br/><br/>So Viktor has no choice but to live in the terminal--much to the<br/><br/>consternation of Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), whose chances of<br/><br/>becoming the terminal's top dog are jeopardized by Viktor's<br/><br/>constantly being under foot.= The movie's premise is laid out pretty flatly in the first ten minutes,<br/><br/>which begins to sink one's hopes. But it's as though Spielberg<br/><br/>wants to get the mandatory stuff out of the way quickly so he can<br/><br/>explore all of the possibilities in his huge playtoy. And he spins<br/><br/>Viktor through every facet of the terminal like a colorful top,<br/><br/>involving the terminal's quirky workers in his meager existence.= In that sense, ""The Terminal"" is a lot like ""Being There"" (1979),<br/><br/>where Peter Sellers played an illiterate simpleton on whom<br/><br/>politicians projected their needs and desires. But Hanks is far<br/><br/>from a blank slate. His body language, physical comedy, and<br/><br/>deceptively simple dialogue speak volumes. Chaplin regretted<br/><br/>having to give up silent movies because he felt that his ""Little<br/><br/>Tramp"" could not express himself uniquely with sound. I think<br/><br/>something like ""The Terminal"" would have been an effective<br/><br/>solution.= That's not to belittle Hanks' winning co-stars, especially Catherine<br/><br/>Zeta-Jones as Viktor's potential love interest and Chi McBride as<br/><br/>one of Viktor's many supporters. They all give Spielberg's work the<br/><br/>sheen of a big, beautiful dream.="
"Brogan","10","1","2","12 June 2004"," Another enjoyable film from Mr. Spielberg! (Possible Spoilers)
","There is something that I was educated about Steven Spielberg 13 years ago right before HOOK was released. Not every Spielberg film is going to be a classic. When there is a new and upcoming Spielberg film, audiences are anticipating for it to be another classic, like JAWS, RAIDERS, E.T., etc. I, at least learned that not every Spielberg film is going to be a classic. The film however, is at least going to be good. That way my expectations are not raised that high. And when a movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST, or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN come along, I will be pleasantly surprised, and wind up loving the film.<br/><br/>The past ten years, Spielberg's films range from the classic (SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, AMISTAD, & MINORITY REPORT); underrated and deserves at least two viewings (A.I. & LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK); and highly entertaining (JURASSIC PARK, and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN). Spielberg isn't trying to make every movie a classic, he's trying to at least be entertaining. With that said, Spielberg's latest film, THE TERMINAL, falls under the highly entertaining category.<br/><br/>TERMINAL tells the story of Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), a immigrant from a fictional Eastern European country who is visiting America for the first time. When Viktor arrives at the immigration office at the New York City airport, he is informed to report to the office of one of the Homeland Security chiefs, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci). Dixon informs Viktor that his home country's government is under attacked, Viktor's visa into the U.S. isn't accepted, while Viktor can not return to his native land. Dixon's solution is to have Viktor wait at the airport, possibly illegally sneak out of the airport onto American soil, and have immigration officers worry about Viktor's fate.<br/><br/>Viktor, however decides to at least apply for a travel visa, with the immigration office, getting rejected at every visit. Viktor knows that he can't return home and doesn't want to break any laws, decides to wait for a legal approval to enter into the U.S. <br/><br/>While waiting, Viktor meets and befriends some of the airport terminal employees. There a shy food server (Diego Luna) who's secretly in love with one of the INS officers (Zoe Saldana) . Gupta Rajan, the rude janitor (played by Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana) who thinks that Viktor is possibly a intelligence officer, while he takes pleasure watching the dashing passengers ignore the ""wet floor"" signs as they slip on the wet floor. A baggage handler (Chi McBride) who sees Viktor as being harmless. And Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an airline stewardess who has dated several men (including married men), yet finds normal attraction in Viktor.<br/><br/>From taking my Spielberg/Lucas class a few years ago, analyzing the themes and subtext messages in Spielberg's films, TERMINAL is more or less a film about a man moving into a new neighborhood. Similar to previous films done about a new figure moving into town and changing the lives of everybody (CHOCOLATE & THE MAJESTIC as recent examples). TERMINAL does follow that familiar plot element. Except, this time the hero doesn't move into a town, but an airport terminal instead.<br/><br/>Yet, like a town there is a assortment of personalities: the timid and shy young man who loves the girl who is so caught up in her career; the humorous and cool older man; the grumpy and misunderstood elderly gentleman; the antagonist who sees the hero as a threat; and the very beautiful woman that the hero falls in love with. If it sounds like a Frank Capra film, then no surprise it is. However, remember that Spielberg was highly influenced by Capra-Corn.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the performances in TERMINAL, with Hanks proving again that he is one of the greatest actors working in cinema. The first 30 minutes of the film, Hanks does a fantastic job playing Viktor as a man who doesn't understand or speak much English. One scene that stands out with Hanks' performance is when Viktor finds out for the first time about a military coup going on in his homeland from the cable news reports. Hanks gives a marvelous performance with his character showing pain, anxiety, fear, confusion, and sadness all at the same time. I mean, darn it, that scene had me in tears when I was watching it, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy.<br/><br/>The supporting performance in TERMINAL are also quite good. Stanley Tucci gives another good role playing the man who insists that he is doing the right thing, despite being the only person who thinks that. Diego Luna, Chi McBride, Kumar Pallana, and Barry Shabaka Henley do all give superb performances. I did feel that Catherine Zeta-Jones also gave a good job, yet I personally would have like to have seen more of her character.<br/><br/>The amazing thing with TERMINAL is the set design, reconstructing the airport terminal. Since Spielberg couldn't shoot at a real airport, he constructed a fictional terminal from a airplane hanger. And looking at the terminal, you would think it was real. I knew before hand that the terminal was only a set. Yet, I did enjoy overhearing other audience members whispering to each other ""is that LAX? Kennedy? or Logan Airport?"" Set designer Anne Kuljian and Production Designer Alex McDowell did a fantastic job creating a realistic airport terminal. With the arrival/departure reader board with the flapping letters & numbers; to the massive amount of stores and restaurants. The terminal features Borders Books, Burger King, Sbarro Pizza, Nathan's Hot Dogs, Discovery Channel Store, Hugo's, and even a Verizon Wireless Phone store (it's only fitting since the Verizon spokesperson is the co-star of the film. On a side note: it would have been funny to see Zeta-Jones' character leave the Verizon store shaking her phone and complaining that particular store's cellular phones do not work. <br/><br/>But since this summer has been filled with massive special effects extravaganzas, it is nice to see a film again that focuses on characters and not visuals. So far, I would say that THE TERMINAL is the most enjoyable film this summer (along with HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN). Like the past summer's from the previous years, it is fun to see big lavish movies like SPIDER-MAN, PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN, MINORITY REPORT, and X-2. But then it's very comforting that plot/character driven films like ROAD TO PERDITION and SEABISCUIT are also released. And that is exactly what TERMINAL is, a highly entertaining plot/character driven film. It is not a Spielberg classic, but it is very enjoyable and entertaining. And that's good enough for me! ***** (out of five)"

This did end up being one of the stories within the movie but didn't take at all away from the other stories, his struggle for survival in the airport and his interactions with the airport's employees. In the end it had all the pieces to become a classic. A funny script that shows the goodness in people is propelled but great acting and amazing directing. If you were ever a fan of Tom Hanks, you WILL love this movie."

","The movie seemed to have an interesting premise, and for the first half hour, I was intrigued. Then, the plot began to fall apart. I didn't understand why airport security was hellbent on keeping him in the airport and not helping him obtain the correct papers. Also, what was with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character? There seemed to be a budding romance, that abruptly ended. The movie was mediocre at best. Even my grandmother was left asking what was going on. Throughout the entire movie I was poked and asked, ""What's going on?"". This was a thin attempt for Spielburg and Hanks to obtain their lost glory. This is no ""Saving Private Ryan."" Watch that instead, it's less painful."

","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Stupid story lines and dialogue and acting so cringe-worthy that I had to fast-forward a lot of the film. What a shame as it's a interesting idea but handled really badly. I look forward to the Hanks and Spielberg combination normally as at least you know you'll be entertained. But not this time. And Catherine Zeta-Jones...possibly the least sympathetic role she's ever played. I'm not sure that was all down to the character as well. The one highlight of this film and unfortunately he is not in every seen is the runaway Indian man who works in the terminal as a cleaner. I don't know who the actor was but his part in this saved me form ejecting the video altogether."

","The premise sounded pretty bad, so I thought there must be something redeeming in this film to have attracted the likes of Spielberg, Hanks, Zeta-Jones, and Saldana... but apparently not.<br/><br/>The movie is utterly uninteresting and poorly written. The situations are so contrived that it's nearly impossible to buy into any of the attempts to convey deeper meaning. It leaves plot threads dangling all over the place and the underlying messages are confused at best. And it's not funny at all.<br/><br/>For a character-based film, it's shocking that none of the characters undergo any character evolution -- in the end everything is exactly the same as it was in the beginning, except that Hanks accomplishes his original goal. Whoop-ti-do. Under the tagline ""life is waiting"" you would expect more to come from the events within -- unexpected life changing events or deeply inspiring meaning. But you'd be wrong. There's none of that. If you try to get any deeper meaning out it, you've got to make it up yourself.<br/><br/>I think the most annoying thing is that it COULD have been done properly without changing much. The actors were solid, and there was enough plot to work with. But instead they botched it at every redeemable chance. All in all, it is just pointless to watch.<br/><br/>Signed, A Disappointed Film-Buff"

","This film just screamed ""Oscar! PLEASE, I WANT AN Oscar!"" for Tom Hanks. It's films like this that make me think he's giving Robin Williams a run for his money as the highest priced whore in Hollywood, with Nicole Kidman and Jude Law running a close third and fourth, respectively. Meaning, each of them seem to be in any film. Good, bad, or indifferent, each of them is turning into the cinema's version of the Bible in American hotels...they're in every drawer.<br/><br/>Give him an accent and a few closeups with teary eyes and swelling violins and we're supposed to be moved. Oh, I was moved, all right. Boredom has the tendency to make one fidgity.<br/><br/>This film moves slower than the Macy's checkout line at Christmas. It only took about five minutes to realize this was an award vehicle for Hanks, and what seemed like six hours to endure it. Think Robin Williams' turn in ""Jakob the Liar."" Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a forgettable and insignificant supporting role as the ditzy Napolean loving flight attendant that we are supposed to believe would be happy with a Sbarro's pizza rather than a candlelit dinner. Stanley Tucci plays the ""mean old airport man"" with one loud note throughout. Of course, the rest of the cast represents airport staff that we are also supposed to believe care enough to a) notice Hanks's character and b) become endeared towards him--to the point that his actual ""departure"" from the airport would shut down operations to go see it. Anyone who's ever had a long lay over at JFK knows what a laughable premise this is.<br/><br/>A huge disappointment to Spielberg fans. Hopefully, he's gotten these mushy feel good flicks out of his system."

","The Terminal starts out with a shaky premise and proceeds to get shakier and shakier as it goes on (and on and on).  It seemed to me like Spielberg was counting on Tom Hanks to be so engrossing that nobody would notice how stupid the movie is.  The good news: Hanks is great, completely at one with his character and thoroughly believable throughout.<br/><br/>The bad news: The film really begins to go seriously downhill when -=- SPOILER ALERT -=- Stanley Tucci's character is outsmarted by Hanks (there's medicine and a non-existent goat involved) and from here, the film starts turning into a third-rate rehash of the superb movie The Shawshank Redemption, with Tucci's character becoming increasingly angered by Hanks, to the point of trying to sabotage him at every turn (just like the sadistic warden did to Tim Robbins in Shawshank).  But there's no redemption here, just an unbelievably contrived sequence where Tucci orders his security people to stop Hanks from leaving the terminal, but of course the head guy sides with Hanks and lets him depart, in the corniest possible way, while Tucci semi-foams at the mouth (he's not really THAT perturbed, you see; the script tries to play it both ways, telegraphing to anyone in the audience with half a brain that this is a pathetic ploy to drag the film out longer by creating a completely unnecessary conflict).  -=- END OF SPOILER<br/><br/>There's a ton of other stupid stuff going on as well; I can site a couple but not all (it would make this review much too long) - one of the guys on the food staff employs Hanks (who is making MORE MONEY than Tucci by mid-film, doing 'under-the-table' construction work, totally inconceivable at an airport) to help him woo the woman who constantly stamps Hanks' form ""REJECTED""; that's ok, that's cool and charming, but it's thoroughly implausible that she -=- SPOILER ALERT =-= winds up MARRYING this guy, without seemingly getting to know him whatsoever. And Hanks himself begins a relationship with a flight attendant (played by Zeta-Jones); she's yer basic hopelessly-devoted-to-a-married-man sadsack, written as a total cliche, as all the characters wind up being.  -=- END OF SPOILER  <br/><br/>I want to point out that I came into this movie totally open-minded; I generally like Spielberg as a director and I think Hanks is brilliant, and I'm also a huge fan of the Tuccinator (as I affectionate call him).  I was willing to suspend disbelief for the basic shaky plot because I thought the film would at least proceed with some sort of intelligence once the premise was set up.  But it's like Spielberg didn't really know what the heck kind of film he was making -- it doesn't really work as a fantasy because there are too many elements of attempted realness involved, it doesn't actually play as a metaphor because Hanks actually has an agenda (involving his father), and it certainly doesn't work as a drama, what with the half-heartedness of the characters' convictions (Tucci's character in particular).  It's not a comedy either because nothing really funny happens. It's a mess, really, and by the time the unbelievably unsatisfying ending comes around, my feelings had shifted, as you can see from what I've written here.  <br/><br/>My suggestion to Spielberg:  Step back, Stevo, step back very far and get a grip.  Some clarity of vision is necessary if you're to maintain your godlike-director status for much longer (at least on THIS planet anyway)."

","Long ago, when Steven Spielberg was in his prime, he would lay down corny music to an already cheesy plot and the crowds loved it.  That was in the 1980s.  20 years later, no one wants to see Tom Hanks lump around in an abandoned airport like a confused dope while more of the same stupid background music plays.  <br/><br/>If this movie would have been released in the 80s, I'm sure it would have been a hit.  It's got all the elements - a totally implausible plot, characters that no one cares about, that message about working class people of all different cultures banding together as one, that horrific music, and an unconvincing attempt at achieving some degree of reality. <br/><br/>
Spielberg needs to face facts - he has lost his mind.  He has lost any inkling of what real life is.  He is forever stuck in the 80s.  He needs to continue making sequels to Gremlins and Batteries Not Included.<br/><br/>I will never see another Spielberg movie again and neither should you."

Most of Tom Hanks accent here would be out of place comming out of the mouth of a horse, but only barely. Because Tom is a good actorer, maybe even as good as that horse in that other classy film, the great Spielberg made later on.<br/><br/>''As of July 2017, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have collaborated for 5 films. The Terminal is the only film in their collaboration which hadn't been nominated for Academy awards.''
This could be one of many reasons why that is:
''In the scene where Viktor and other people sing the Krakozhian national anthem, they sing the anthem of Albania in ""gibberish"" words.
Although Viktor comes from the fictional country of Krakozhia, the language he speaks in the movie is Bulgarian. The written material shown (the Fodor's guide and the magazine page with the jazz greats) is in bad Russian.''

","As a film, The Terminal is a beauty to watch and to look at. Yes, I believe the two are different. At least in this sense. Just because you're watching a film doesn't mean you like looking at it. You're sort of just watching what is happening. Who knows if you actually like what you're seeing? It's like if you're seeing Saw. Yes, you're watching it, but do you like to look deeply into the eyes of victims who have been gutted and left for dead? The Terminal is a lot brighter and more vivid than most dramas I have seen, and it's a beautiful film all around. It's food for your eyes and your thoughts.<br/><br/>I'm not sure another actor could've played the character of Viktor Navorski better. Tom Hanks has been working in film for about thirty years now, and has ejected his charisma into almost every character he has played. As an actor, Hanks is fantastic. As a character actor, Hanks is excellent.<br/><br/>In The Terminal, he is Viktor Navorski, who travels from the fictional country of Krakozhia to the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Navorski's native country is in ruins with a recent revolution taking place, and all planes in and out of the country have just been halted. His passport and credit cards are no longer valid either, meaning he can't enter the United States. He has slipped through a rare, unexpected crack that basically states he can't go forward or backwards. He has can't pass ""Go"" or collect $200.<br/><br/>His home base is the airport, a large and, literally, foreign world to Viktor, who can't speak English fluently. He spends most of his time desperately seeking money by returning luggage carts for a quarter a piece so he can have his next meal, eating saltine crackers and ketchup, and sleeping restlessly on rows of chairs. I'd like to call The Terminal a comedy, but the film is so sad in some parts it earns the title of ""a drama."" CBP Head Frank Dixon (Tucci) questions Navorski's strange behavior and his unhinged abiding of the rules. He doesn't resist, yell, scream, or get flustered. He just abides. Dixon wants Navorski out of his care, and tries to force him out the doors of the airport. Much to his dismay, Navorski chooses to follow the rules and stay put until the light is green. There is something so very admirable about a character who can cope peacefully in a cryptic and stressful situation.<br/><br/>It is much to my surprise that the entire airport is a man-made set in a hangar in Palmdale. It looks marvelous. According to director Steven Spielberg, everything functions as it would in real life, with real food and drinks in the designated outlets, real working stoves in the food court, bathrooms, escalators, etc.<br/><br/>I love films set in a public area, which would explain my fondness for films like Career Opportunities, Clerks, and Mallrats. Why I'm so astonished at The Terminal's location is that the film doesn't feel low or shy on material where it has to resort to pictorial aspects as a means of humor and substance. Scenes from a Mall, a Woody Allen movie, was about a married couple working out their marital differences, in public, while walking around a mall. There were so many unnecessary elements like a cloyingly unfunny mime wandering around with them and the fact that Allen's character had to lug around a huge yellow surfboard for the majority of the film. Those elements felt like gratuitous and impetuous distractions. Not to mention, the film didn't need to be set in a mall area. This was a film about a couple working out their differences; why did they have to do it in public? The Terminal avoids redundancy by including various characters, and dodges caricatures and dramatic dead-ends by providing development and substance to each one it introduces. When we go to an airport, we don't care about the janitor, the security guards, the people in there, or the people flying the plane; we care about getting from there to our desired destination, on time, and in one piece. Spielberg has created a wonderful, whimsical, optimistic, yet sometimes poignant story focusing on a man's unfortunate experience in purgatory without turning it into a ridiculous epiphany or a laugh riot.<br/><br/>Starring: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Barry Shabaka Henley, Kumar Pallana.

","Shot almost entirely on a two-and-a-half-story recreation of a full-size operating airport terminal, this romantic comedy entitled,The Terminal from director Steven Spielberg revolves around Viktor Navorski.<br/><br/>The Terminal is a comedy-drama film that stars Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones together with Stanley Tucci,Barry Shabaka Henley,Kumar Pallana and Diego Luna. It is about a man trapped in a terminal at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport when he is denied entry into the United States and at the same time cannot return to his native country, the fictitious Krakozhia, due to a revolution. It is partially inspired by the 18-year-stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in the Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Terminal I, Paris, France from 1988 to 2006.<br/><br/>An Eastern European man by the name of Viktor Navorski,whose plans of immigrating to New York were hastened by a violent coup in his home country. Unfortunately, Viktor finds himself on the wrong end of a nasty technicality while en route to America: His passport was issued from a country, which, during its upheaval, ceased to exist in an official capacity. Unauthorized to leave Kennedy Airport upon his arrival and unable to return home, Viktor finds himself exiled inside the terminal's international transit lounge. Though airport official Frank Dixon views Viktor as an annoying bureaucratic glitch, other airport employees -- including a beautiful flight attendant by the name of Amelia -- come to see him as a welcome, if unofficial, addition to their numbers. As the days stretch on into months, the terminal transforms from an intimidating atmosphere of forced assimilation into a country within itself, complete with culture, ambition, status, complex diversity, and the need for love.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film for the story threads that play out enjoyably, and other threads end up going nowhere as it was played completely in one location: the airport terminal. Enjoy the film from scene to scene, since there are definite pleasures along the way. I commend Hanks for his brilliant portrayal of Victor Navorski for he was excellent in keeping the viewers interest and sympathy towards him from the beginning to the end of the film.Also,I applaud Spielberg for delving into some new territory that was never explored in other films in the past. Although some may not be satisfied with Spielberg's direction,I still find this movie truly entertaining and mesmerizing."

","A charming throwback to the Frank Capra era of filmmaking. Tom Hanks plays an eastern European come to visit New York only to find himself detained at the airport's international terminal as his country's government is toppled by civil war and he has lost his citizenship. He lives in the terminal, and finds various ways to feed himself. He speaks some English and eventually learns more by studying magazines and watching television. He also makes friends with various airport characters, including a janitor and a stewardess. The plot is based on a true incident that I suspect was much less charming and endearing in real life. The script is pure, delicious fantasy. Hanks is brilliant and thoroughly believable as the baffled but resourceful immigrant while Stanley Tucci as the airport's security chief does wonders with what could easily have been a one-dimensional role. Director Spielberg no doubt played a role in keeping everything on track. Highly recommended, especially to those who loved the not-dissimilar ""Moscow on the Hudson"" with Robin Williams. By the way, the sets are absolutely amazing. I assumed the movie was filmed in a real airport terminal until I read here that the whole thing was shot on sets built in an old hangar."

In ""The Terminal"" as he assumes the role of a tourist from the fictional East-European nation of Krakozhia with effortless mastery, down to the accent and mannerisms.

","I know that it's a blatantly-absurd contradiction, but I've always regarded Steven Spielberg, despite his incredible critical and commercial success, as a monumentally underestimated director. Many critics tend to regard him as something of a lesser filmmaker, adequate for immaterial mass entertainment, but relatively useless for anything that comes even close to approaching true art. As you no doubt have guessed, I take the completely opposite viewpoint, regarding him as one of the finest directors that Hollywood has to offer; one who, despite his occasional preference towards sentimentality, knows precisely what he wants in a movie, and constructs it in a way that is both technically admirable and unashamedly entertaining. 'The Terminal (2004),' likewise, is one of the Spielberg's most under-appreciated outings, an intensely-enjoyable, and occasionally whimsical, lighthearted comedy that is nonetheless able to pack an emotional punch when required. Filled with a likable cast of characters, and an atypical romantic hero in Tom Hanks' Krakozhian traveller, this is the sort of film that you can simply sit to watch and allow your daily problems to dissipate into the open air.<br/><br/>If you were to choose any A-list Hollywood actor to portray a Russian tourist with little command in English, then I predict that Tom Hanks, despite his talent and multiple Oscars, would appear near the bottom of your list of potential candidates. However, not only does the character of Viktor Navorski work, but his personality is so intensely likable that he's one of Hanks' most entertaining creations. Hopelessly lost in an immense airport lounge, with no idea why he's even being detained there, Viktor wanders aimlessly throughout the hustle-and-bustle of the arriving and departing passengers, necessarily developing a haphazard, ad hoc existence for himself, making both friends and enemies along the way. Though Viktor's poor knowledge of English paints the deceptive impression of a dim mind, as his linguistic skills slowly develop, a vibrant personality begins to shine through his initially comical exterior, and a man of admirable humility and sincerity reveals himself. Catherine Zeta-Jones lights up the screen as Amelia Warren, a beautiful flight attendant who falls for Viktor, despite her obsessive compulsion towards wealthy married men who hold no future for her.<br/><br/>The opening act of 'The Terminal' does an impressive job of accentuating the difficulties that arise when a foreign traveller becomes ""lost in translation."" Viktor's initial meeting with airport manager Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is a hopelessly impossible conversation in which no meaningful understanding is reached by either party. When Viktor finally realises that a revolution has unfolded in his home country, his anguish at not being able to understand the full details is tragic and heartbreaking, especially when his cries for assistance fall on deaf ears. An incredible backwards crane shot, zooming out from Viktor's frantic form to reveal the vast expanse of JFK airport, is perhaps a visual reference to a similar shot in Fred Zinneman's 'High Noon (1952).' Whereas the latter demonstrates the haunting solidarity of Gary Cooper's character, Spielberg's shot shows Viktor equally alone and abandoned, surrounded by crowds of self-interested travellers who might as well be non-existent. Though Spielberg occasionally veers towards sentimentality, 'The Terminal' is an entertaining and thoughtful comedy/drama; sometimes the simple stories are the ones we find most refreshing."

"psu_guy521","9","1","3","1 July 2007"," Like It's Main Character, This Movie Is Stuck In Limbo
","Behind the production were the names of director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks. The story was rather simple, a foreign man traveling to New York City for an unknown reason becomes stuck inside the international terminal at New York's JFK airport, and he begins to develop a relationship with the people around him as he waits to be able to leave. With such men behind the film and such a simple story, the expectations were different for all sorts of people. Film critics expected a Oscar worthy drama with some sophisticated comedy with realism in the development of its characters and plot. The average popcorn flick audience was expecting more of an entertaining slap stick humor movie. However, this is where the film succeeds and the people unwilling to compromise miss out. Steven Spielberg has created a light, heartfelt comedy that blends the perfect mix of slap stick and sophisticated comedy, with a plot that develops characters, yet takes twists and turns that, although sometimes over-the-top, keep the audience entertained and a movie with such a simple plot and setting interesting. The acting from Hanks is again noteworthy as well as the other members of a very well formed cast, and the moments the film has to offer can bring tears of joy and tones of laughter. The most impressive part of the film is the set, an entire airport terminal designed so realistically, that not one person viewing the film should be able to tell it is a set. This movie is an achievement for Spielberg and for cinema. Like its main character, the film is stuck in limbo, neither a comedy full of unintelligible humor, or a film striving to impress the Acadamy. It is a film that will entertain viewers who don't have expectations. You will never have more fun in a terminal."

","Though the story is utterly unbelievable, the execution is sublime. Hanks portrays Viktor Navorsky as a kind, honorable & gentle soul, who is both adaptive & inventive - it's wonderful to watch the creative solutions he comes to to counted the obstacles places before him. Stanley Tucci plays a complete b@st@rd so beautifully, the film would have been a failure without him. The love story was the weakest part of the script, unfortunately Catherine-Zeta Jones' love interest character didn't sparkle as some of the other characters did, indeed it was the only weak link in this story, but it's important to state that it was weak only in contrast to the other characters. Kumar Pallana and Diego Luna's supporting roles were played to perfection, Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci & Chi McBride were all wonderful. And there is NO objectionable subject matter or language, making this a must-see movie, for all ages."
"matlefebvre20","7","1","3","28 December 2006"," A story of sealed items
","Comedy has never been Steven Spielberg's specialty. ""1941"" was the only serious comedy made by Spielberg and it became one of his biggest failures. Other than that, Spielberg infused his other movies with subtle touches of humor, but it was essentially a small tool that helped to keep contact with the viewer.<br/><br/>""The Terminal"" is by far the greatest straight-forward comedy ever directed by Steven Spielberg. The genius of this movie is that it turns a very serious and worrying situation into an avalanche of errors and funny situations, just like Kubrick turned nuclear holocaust into a big farce in ""Dr. Strangelove"".<br/><br/>The always excellent Tom Hanks stars as Viktor Navorski, a man from Krakozhia who wants to get an autograph from famous saxophonist Benny Golson for his deceased father who was an avid jazz fan.<br/><br/>However, the situation becomes more complicated upon his arrival at JFK airport. Viktor learns that a coup occurred in his country and his passport is not valid anymore. Thereby, he cannot penetrate in America and he cannot return in his country neither. The only solution is that he must live in the international transit lounge until another solution becomes possible.<br/><br/>Viktor speaks very little English and he doesn't completely understand his situation. Anyway, he settles himself into the airport (Gate 67, to be more specific) and a new life begins for him.<br/><br/>Sometimes, we believe that an actor gets a couple of big roles and then, he only becomes a name. Tom Hanks is not that kind of actor. He won Oscars for ""Philadelphia"" and ""Forrest Gump"" and he got notable roles in ""Apollo 13"" and ""Cast Away"", but his role in ""The Terminal"" is one of his greatest.<br/><br/>In a sense, Viktor Navorski looks like Forrest Gump to me. His language is not clear (for different reasons) and his situation makes the other 'normal' people looking the same way.<br/><br/>An airport is a very ordinary place. Ordinary and almost dull, especially for regular travelers. But Spielberg transforms this boring place into a fantastic environment, almost like a country inside a country. We discover the type of people working there, what is hidden behind every door and the very characteristics of the building.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the airport becomes a destination itself.<br/><br/>""The Terminal"" is a story of sealed items. Of course, there's the airport which is Viktor's prison for a long time. But there's also that special peanut can, which is the fuel of Viktor's travel. This blue box intrigues not only the characters, but ourselves as well. And when we learn what it contains, it becomes the most heart-warming moment of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Also heart-warming are the scenes when Viktor is about to leave the terminal at the end of the movie. We see the bunch of friends met by Viktor and they follow him like fans who follow a rock star.<br/><br/>This is the kind of story that we all love. A man wants to get a very little thing and he gets it, but he also gets much much more that he wanted to get. And this element is well-highlighted by Spielberg and the tens of characters.<br/><br/>So, ""The Terminal"" is a very comical movie, but it is also serious and it's a perfect display of what is good in ourselves.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie to grab, before it flies away."
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","1","3","20 December 2006"," This is a metaphor of security obsession
","Steven Spielberg brings together a civil war in some Slavic country, a tourist from this country coming to John Fitzgerald Kennedy Airport on a private visit to New York City, a brand new security boss and an international diplomatic imbroglio that can last centuries if it is not taken care of by history. When a lawful government in a foreign country is ousted by an unlawful revolution and replaced by a fully illegal government that the US does not recognize, all flights from and to this foreign countries are banned in the US, and all citizens from this country have non-valid passports. If this happens to take place when one of these citizens is in the terminal of the airport before going through customs he can never get an entry-visa and is trapped in the airport for a long time. Imagine this situation and imagine the passenger is an enterprising but law abiding man and you can imagine too how he is going to find a place in the terminal, in the hearts of all the regular workers in that terminal including security officers, and even in some transient personnel like stewardesses or who knows what and whom. There we find out that this silly situation can become pathetic and even full of empathy and sympathy, even some compassion. One could live for a long long time in a terminal. But everything has to come to an end one day and it is even more difficult to bring the absurd situation to an end than to avoid it or solve it. At times it is funny. At times it is a deep satire of American security obsession. At times it is symbolical and metaphorical. But it is always extremely human and even humane. Even in such an artificial surrounding things can remain heartfelt and throbbingly moving.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

","I really had a hard time trying to figure out whether a movie set entirely in an airport terminal could really be worth the hype? But when I finally got around to seeing this movie, I was pretty impressed. Spielberg had pulled it off again. I have problems with the fictional country they invented just for this movie. Perhaps they should have just utilized some existing political situation. In cases, some actors clearly over acted and while that ""medicine"" scene was well written, the ending of it was not quite satisfying. A lot of other stuff will also not make much sense.

And the fact that he does not get Zeta-Jones in the end makes it even more beautiful.The movie starts with Hank's character coming to America and discovering at the airport that his country is no longer recognized by the US ,which makes him a man without a country.He can neither get out nor in to the US and has to stay in the airport till the problems in his country are sorted out.And there is this really interesting character played by Tucci who lives by the law and does everything in his power to force Hanks out .

","Won't bore you with the details to the film because you can get them from the 478 other reviews. <br/><br/>Some fun concepts to play with though while watching the movie, which I highly recommend: <br/><br/>Delay - Viktor is""delayed"" at the international terminal in New York, by Frank Dixon, who is in charge of guarding security for the US Immigration department. Who is really delayed? Dixon, representing the US? He follows fear based laws and meanness/revenge rather than simple heart based human kindness and common sense. Viktor behaves as a well adjusted adult making the best of whatever situation he finds himself in. Dixon wants to ""control"" everything as a frightened child would. His development is delayed/ arrested. <br/><br/>Another undercurrent is love/acceptance vs. fear and control: Dixon must control; must have the spy cameras; he needs his army of docile ""bull-dogs"" Viktor ""creates"" an army of loving friends/family just by being a kind soul willing to sacrifice himself for the good of another. <br/><br/>Playing fair/honest/real vs. playing dirty and corrupt: Viktor was genuine and even offered kindness to Dixon. Frightened little boy Dixon did so many underhanded and dirty things just because he felt threatened. Fortunately it all backfired on him.<br/><br/>Terrific and very subtle movie on so many levels. Great life commentary."

","Maybe it's the nature of the films he selects. In any case, Tom Hanks is in virtually every scene in this movie, and in many of them he is alone. This was also true of Cast Away. In both movies Hanks strives to overcome a series of problems, some realistic, some contrived. A modern day rework of Charlie Chaplin's ""little tramp"" style of story telling. The movie is not bad, but when the story becomes subordinate to the movie star, it becomes a distraction and the whole production suffers. This movie is another valentine that Tom Hanks has sent to himself. If you go to movies to see the stars rather than the stories, then this may be for you."

"patrick_dunne","8","1","3","13 November 2005"," Spielburg can still make good movies; The Terminal one is sweet, innocent and humane.
","What can I say? This was a wonderful movie. It's full of simplicity, sweetness and humanity.<br/><br/>After Spielberg made us jump at Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park, and after he made us afraid to go into the water with Jaws, and after he made us cry with E.T. and Schindler's List, the famous director decides to settle down. It wasn't a bad choice.<br/><br/>The Terminal is something you can just sit back, watch and enjoy. You don't have to rack your brain for answers to the twists. You won't have to cover your eyes and the gore, or worry about crying in front of your friends. All you have to do is watch.<br/><br/>The Terminal is a simple movie, but in a good way. It doesn't use CGI and action scenes to cover up its simplicity, like some other movies. It knows that it is simple, and easy to understand, so it's easier to watch.<br/><br/>The Terminal doesn't overdo anything at all! The jokes keep humane and sweet, without profanity, sexual references, stupidity or unnecessary buildup. It doesn't try to be the best film you've ever seen, but the result may be something close. It's creative. The storyline is new (while not exactly perfect) and the characters are fun. Tom Hanks uses his acting skills and creativity to play Viktor Navorski, who uses his creativity to survive in the airport. He meets people and he helps them with their lives, and eventually changes the airport a bit.<br/><br/>The film is funny, but also romantic. Viktor falls in love with a struggling woman named Amelia. You have no choice but to smile at the sweetness.<br/><br/>But, that's not all. The Terminal is touching, and you will feel passion and warmth in your heart when you watch. It may be a bit melancholy at first, when Viktor arrives at the airport, and is scared, but later becomes romantic. The ending is touching too. The happy ending will make you smile.<br/><br/>I know I am mostly copying Roger Ebert, so I'll add in something original.<br/><br/>The Terminal is also about how the man changes the airport. After the line ""You can learn something from him"" (Of course, it's talking about Viktor.) the film shows the impact of one man in one place. His sense of justice and good-heartedness changes the airport in a small way. <br/><br/>Tom Hank's performance is Oscar-worthy. There haven't been many feel-good films since his famous ""Forrest Gump."" I don't really know how to describe the beauty of the film. It's just good. See it. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","All of the ingredients in this one (Spielberg, Hanks, Zeta-Jones and a strong supporting cast) are a recipe for success. And the film delivers. Though many people feel that Spielberg and Hanks' heyday have been over for years, this film proves that they have still got it. I think the most impressive thing about it is that you lose sight of the fact that Hanks (cast totally against type as an Eastern European would-be immigrant) is playing the main character. He does such a good job of immersing himself into Viktor Navorsky that the actor is incidental to the character. Major props to Hanks for the performance, with a near-perfect accent and mannerism.

This movie shows you loving each other doesn't need any Language. You just need to show your feeling, the others will understand that.

His arrival brought vigor to the building. But the customs officer did not like him and tried everything to get rid of him. Due to his honesty, kindness and optimism, he won the game. After Viktor helped a man who carried the medicine that was for his sick father, he became a hero. His action won everyone's heart except the cold-blood officer.<br/><br/>Life just likes a trip. You will meet different people in the journey. Viktor was unlucky, but he was lucky at the same time. He had a short love story with a beautiful stewardess. His friendship with other three men was impressive. What the old man did for Victor was really amazing. In the end the black guard took off his jacket and put it on Viktor, everyone was on Viktor's side (of cause except one guy), that pushed the film into the climax.<br/><br/>No doubt Tom Hanks proved his value with convincing performance. I think even the fussy critic can not say anything wrong on him. Although he won the academy award (the best actor) for Forrest Gump(a wonderful comedian, Tom was great in it), I would rather vote for this role. From the role, I can learn much.<br/><br/>One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10"

For this reason, he has to stay at the airport, as he cannot get into the country. A great variety of situations happen to him while he lives in the airport: from really hilarious to really sad situations.<br/><br/>The movie is great, not only for the plot but for the acting.

","I watched this film for the second time last night, as I recently saw Spielberg's latest, War of the Worlds, and was in a Spielberg mood! What I like about the Terminal is that it, for me, has a lot of similarities to the old Billy Wilder films such as The Apartment and Irma La Douce, in that love/romance springs up in the most unlikely of places or situations. It is great to see modern filmmakers returning to the roots of film-making in this way! There are plenty of humorous elements in this, and the characters are interesting and the storytelling rich. Tom Hanks plays Viktors character very convincingly, and the three friends he meets in the terminal are convincingly portrayed. Nice one!"

","I was looking forward to watching this movie, but I somehow found it to be a bit flat and boring. I thought Tom Hanks did a great job, as he always does, but I wasn't impressed with anyone else. The romance between Viktor and Amelia was not very well done, and I wish it had been worked into the storyline a bit better. The basic premise did have some merit, but after about the first half hour or so, it got a bit old and there was little added to the storyline to help move it along. If you're looking for a good romantic comedy, my advice is for you to look elsewhere - I can think of a good dozen or so that are better than this turned out to be. On the other hand, this isn't the worst movie of all time, either. I guess I just wasn't all that impressed with The Terminal."
"The_Void","7","1","3","5 July 2005"," Not bad, but not Spielberg at his best either
","There's no doubting that Spielberg knows the workings of cinema well enough to ensure that his movies are always entertaining, but sometimes he doesn't choose his projects all that wisely. The man is at his best when he's got a huge budget and a long list of stunts to play with; and he showed this with his Indiana Jones trilogy and Jurassic Park films. When Spielberg attempts drama, the results are often mixed. Schindler's List stunk of a blockbuster director trying to win an Oscar, and while it doesn't look like Spielberg was going for gold with this picture; the movie doesn't quite bode right, and much of the drama seems forced or overly sentimental. This makes the film hard to take seriously at times, especially since many of the events in the film are completely detached from reality. The extremely swift wedding ceremony sticks out the most. The plot, based on a true story, follows Viktor Navorski; an Eastern European man who finds himself stranded in a New York airport when his country goes to war and isn't letting anyone in or out. He then, through lack of other options, decides to take up residency in the airport itself.<br/><br/>In 2004, Tom Hanks delivered an outstandingly over the top performance in the Coen's remake of the Ealing classic, The Ladykillers. The Terminal sees Hanks delivering another over the top performance, but it's not half as good this time. Hanks' put on European accent isn't bad, but it quickly becomes annoying. His dumb antics are another thing that becomes annoying all too quickly, and after about an hour; the premise begins to show signs of becoming tired. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Hanks' massively underdeveloped love interest. It is this aspect that is the film's main downfall. The romance between these two is hardly explored and it happens all too quickly. It therefore feels like an afterthought in an underdeveloped movie. It isn't all woe for this film, however, as the movie does have it's good points. Spielberg does a surprisingly good job of setting up his protagonist's plight and the way that we are constantly reminded of the predicament that the immigrant is in, is good. On the whole, this is worth watching; but Spielberg has been better, and far more entertaining, than this on many occasions."
"lavatch","Null","1","3","20 June 2005"," Is Hollywood Running Out of Ideas for Good Films?????
","In one of the few memorable lines of dialogue from ""The Terminal,"" the character played by Catherine Zeta-Jones asks Tom Hanks's character Victor, ""Just tell me the truth. Did you escape from an institution?"" The same question might be posed to the screenwriters, director, and producers of the lackluster film ""The Terminal.""<br/><br/>First, we have the setting of the film, an airline terminal that is closer to a shopping mall than an airport. Then, we have an airport security crew that is no more competent than the hotel casino staff of ""Ocean's Eleven."" Then, we have a gestapo-like security administrator (played by Stanley Tucci) who detains a decent man at the airport and forces him to live for months in the airline terminal. Viktor then proceeds to ""move into"" the terminal, tearing apart the permanent seating; turning off the electricity; and reconstructing whole sections of the airport with his skills as a builder and contractor.<br/><br/>Was this story supposed to be funny? Was this film intended as one of Steven Spielberg's parables and ""feel good"" films? The premise was not funny, and the response elicited was not heart-warming. The one potential breath of fresh air in the film was the character of the flight attendant, as played by Zeta-Jones. But even her character was not likable. After befriending Viktor, she then apparently opts for an adulterous affair with a silver-haired pilot, whose face we never see.<br/><br/>In sum, the main idea for this film was preposterous, and the film was not very well executed. It was not a realistic portrayal of the JFK airport, including the personnel, the travelers, and the security team. The plot lacked realism, humor, and depth of characterization. Based upon this film experience, I would conjecture that Hollywood is struggling to come up with vibrant ideas for films. In the past year, I have seen better films that were made for cable with much smaller budgets and much more artistry than the shallow film experience of ""The Terminal."""
"March15","6","1","3","22 April 2005"," it'a all about waiting
","Politics first: Viktor Navorski is man who gets stuck on JFK Airport because his homeland Krakochia is on the verge of revolution that has been spreading during his flight to US. Krakochia cannot be identified as a country and therefore Navorski does not have a permission to walk on US soil or fly back home. Hours of waiting turn to days,days turn to months and before he even notices Viktor has a life in the Airport.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg continues his collaboration with Tom Hanks (previous was Catch me if you can) in a film that is not Spielberg on his finest and even not Spielberg-Hanks team on its finest but still manages to proof that Hanks was originally a comedian. Spielberg's old school humour relies on the odd circumstances of life in a busy international terminal and very much on physical comedy in which both it rather well succeeds. <br/><br/>The weakest link propably is the ""romantic"" storyline that keeps going in circles and does feel a bit glued on although being quite realistic thinking of two strangers meeting in such circumstances. Catherine Zeta-Jones feels quite out of the place here and the chemistry between Hanks and her does not utterly convince. Stanley Tucci's terminal manager is overworked and kept me thinking how this kind of movie does not need such ""baddie"" at all."
"nefedor","10","1","3","18 April 2005"," Clearly the best movie I saw in 2004.

The people, who came to see ""something funny"" or some cool but brainless action with fighting, races, shootings, killings etc found ""The Terminal"" boring. No surprise here: this move isn't for pop-culture audience, it's for people who can think and feel all hidden but beautiful turns of a movie. But there are many people who just stacked in facts they think don't make sense and blame the move to contain mistakes. That's learning English in couple weeks, made-up Victor's country and language, etc. These folks somehow thinks that the story of an airport adventure must be absolutely real, contain only true and recognizable facts and better be a documentary. They just don't see that unimportant things, who are just setting the stage, could easily be made in fairytale-like style and the movie like Terminal will only gain from it, not concentrating on ""how exactly that happened"". And finally, the most misunderstood point of the movie is the final of the Victor's love story as well as the box with signatures. That's because many observers have got emotional reflection but couldn't clarify the main idea of the movie, which this comment is actually about. This movie isn't about love or devotion, but about the conflict between the human personality and the system. It's the unique character of Victor which makes him deal with absolutely every situation he gets in in the airport and to become a winner, having love from everybody around him. He changes barking ""Next!"" officer Torres to a happy wife of his friend Enrike, who, once, even talks to him in his native language, forgetting the language difference. And that's why Amelia, who is definitely a part of her own system, a circle she couldn't get out, can't go along with him. And one of the most touching moments of the picture: small Indian man Gupta with a mop runs towards a huge monstrous plane (representing The System) which must crash him, but miracle happens: the moment he touches the plane wheels be his mop, the plane stops; the human is stronger and victorious over the System. That episode is so strong, I would compare it with ""Love is beautiful"", where the boy is standing in the middle of deserted concentration camp, and suddenly from behind the corner comes the real tank, promised him by his father, who is already dead... And being very familiar with US immigration system as well as arriving at JFK, I can say that the topic and the spirit of the movie is just right: I'm proud to live in country, who can recognize it's own weaknesses and make such a wonderful movie about it like Spielberg did. I rank this movie with maximum score."

","With Steven Spielberg it's 80 percent that the movie works pretty well, why? Because Spielberg simply has reached a point in his career and has a ability to make without back thoughts, good movies, he simply knows the recipe. Starring Tom Hanks as a Russian this movie kicks off smoothly offering what the movie has to offer; charming and well acted conversations and a airport set scene.<br/><br/>THE TERMINAL isn't the ordinary Spielberg movie in many ways, and if you don't have the guts to see Hanks making up his accent, this is a very straight forward tail about a guy who's stuck in nowhere land. Though it's a original idea, there's not really much original ideas inside it or magnificent things happening here - but still; Spielberg and company keeps it a very charming and entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a Russian who's stuck on the international terminal; without possibilities to go back to his country in war or to New York City laying just outside the airport walls. So he has to live there until he gets clearance to enter NY or back to where he came from. But off course; this bad English speaking guy do get into different kind of situations that makes the airport security pretty fed up but in the same time, fascinated by the guy.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks acts well, very well actually. He is so relaxed and amusing that it all works so much more well than I had expected, brilliant photography and fine music as always in Spielberg films, this movie has very much working before it really has started just because of it being a Spielbergian motion picture, though it's very far from his best movies. Zeta-Jonesa may not be doing her best performance either, but hey! This is charm and choosy."

","There are too many faults to list here that would help justify my belief that this film is simply terrible, but if you're interested, just check out the various message boards which list them. Be careful, it's a big list.<br/><br/>The implausible plot turns in this movie would be expected if they were made by rank amateurs, but the writers/director/producers/stars of this film are simply too good for this. Spielberg directed this film? I find it hard to believe. I'm thinking it must be another person with the same name who conned the studio into letting him direct Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The high rating on IMDb is no doubt due to two facts: 1) Any film with Hanks/Spielberg, regardless of the movie itself, will start at a 6 out of 10 and work it's way up from there. I personally admire both of these men and part of me feels the same way, but I couldn't step over the countless holes in this movie.<br/><br/>2) People who love this film are so desperate for an escape from their otherwise dreary lives that they will buy into every irrational plot development that unfolds. Hottie flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Douglas) falling for a bumbling immigrant? Sure...it's so romantic! What a waste of time....<br/><br/>ebhp"

","The terminal sounded like a dead end film to me. It was the trailer that first put me off the film. However, I did promise myself that I would watch the film when it came on DVD because of hanks and Spielberg's contribution. I loved the ""Terminal""; in fact it's probably the only film I've watched twice in the same evening. Based on the true story of the Iranian transient in 1988 ""who's still there and was offered 1/4 million dollars by Spielberg- at Charles DE Gaulle airport"" this film is set at JFK. What I like about the film was that it revolved around relationships with people working at airport rather than lots of small solo stories or stories with other transients like that in ""Castaway"". Hanks needs others to find that sweet innocence inside him that makes people love him although not necessarily want to make love too him.""will explain later"" Much of the narrative and directing is excellent / masterful but in places it borders on the ridiculous. It's as if two directors were making the same film. Egg the slapstick scene of hanks trying to sleep on the chairs did not work for me. Perhaps the most intriguing element was the casting of Catherine Zeta Jones. At first I thought that their was no sexual chemistry between the two but then I realised that she had been cast for that precise reason. The two connect on a spiritual level but not on a sexual level. And this is key to the ending of the film. So it was not hanks but CZJ grey haired lover who you envied.IE the man who gives her ""great sex"" and then leaves her. I feel it is the ending that spooled the film for me. I would have like to have seen some twist regardless of how unrealistic that would make the two transcend the spiritual relationship.""the clinch and night they spend together doesn't count"" An alternative ending could have been that Victor becomes a celebrity for staying at the airport has TV companies endorsements and is offered a vast amount of money from a movie company to make his biopic. I do want my happy endings when i pay to see mainstream - and love to watch my art /gangster films over the weekend when i expect death loneliness and espresso.Give me chips with my burgers and french beans with my salmon steak."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","24 February 2005"," A master class in 'product placement', also has a rather nice movie embedded.
","Up front I want to state that I really like ""The Terminal"". Tom Hanks is very good as the Eastern European temporarily without a country, forced by 'the rules' to live for some time in the NY airport terminal while things got sorted out. Reminiscent of another movie where he played a stranded man, ""Cast Away."" But foremost, it became obvious that this was a Spielberg 'master class' in product placement.<br/><br/>I will not further the cause by mentioning any of the products and merchants featured, but it is clear from the framing of shots, the props within scenes not contributing to the story, and the camera trailing the character to linger on a business name or logo that ""product placement"" was a main consideration by Spielberg in making the movie. Film students would do well to study ""The Terminal"" from this point of view to see what can be done.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. While he was flying to NY, Viktor's (Tom Hanks) country became involved in a civil war which lasted over a year. Since this invalidated his passport, and he could not go home, the International Lounge was the only place he could go, he figured for one or two days at the most. When you piece together all the dates, it eventually becomes over a year, September 2003 to December 2004.<br/><br/>His nemesis was the security head Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who at first tried to encourage Viktor to escape the terminal so that he could call the NY police, effectively giving the problem to someone else. When wily Viktor figured this out (security cameras tracking him) he decided he would just wait. He learned that he could make money for food by returning rented carts for the 25 cents 'reward', until mean Frank put a stop to that. However as luck would often favor Viktor, a food worker Enrique enlisted his help to woo a pretty young officer, and in return Viktor got all the airline food he wanted. Viktor also turned out to be an excellent craftsman and was hired for $19 an hour, cash under the table, helping to complete terminal remodeling.<br/><br/>Viktor falls in love with pretty flight attendant Amelia (Cathy Z-Jones), she likes him, thinks he is just a frequent traveler too, but in the end she is attracted to the wrong kind of guy. We find out near the end that Viktor's whole reason for going to NY was to get the autograph of one last Jazz musician, who played in the music lounge of a certain hotel. When his friend Gupta, the janitor, delays the flight back home using his mop, Viktor has just enough time to get the autograph, hear one song live, and return home with his peanut can now filled with autographs from all of his deceased dad's favorite Jazz musicians. Why did he do it? ""Because I believe he would have done it for me."" <br/><br/>I don't know if it was sloppy filming, or a fluke of final editing, but the dates on the immigration stamps did not always make sense in the time line. And, at one point when Viktor had been there for 13 months, Amelia mentions ""you didn't tell me you have been here for 9 months."" Surprising for a Spielberg film, still a very good story and a very enjoyable movie. I saw it twice on successive days."
"segacs","4","1","3","21 February 2005"," Fanciful and disappointing
","Steven Spielberg had a mega-hit with E.T. in the early 80s... and, with few exceptions (e.g. Schindler's List) he's been remaking the same movie ever since. It seems with The Terminal that he's proved himself incapable of making much else.<br/><br/>This time, Tom Hanks plays a man from a remote Slavic country who is trapped in a New York airport terminal when a revolution in his country invalidates his passport. A wholly unrealistic premise, except it's based on a true story. The problem is, instead of using the true story as a real basis for an important film, Spielberg instead tries to turn a serious plight into a fanciful fairy tale.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who is an eminently capable actor, gets very little chance on screen to develop his character into a true human being, distraught and frightened as anyone would be under these circumstances. He never seems frustrated or fed up with the bureaucratic red tape that is essentially holding him hostage. He is unbelievably patient, choosing to adopt a happy-go-lucky existence paying for food with quarters from the cart return machines, making friends with airport employees, and chasing romance with a flighty stewardess played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. You never really understand Hanks's character's motives or inner thoughts. He's just this inexplicably resourceful, patient, plucky man who arouses some curiosity among the people around him.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci, also normally a capable actor, plays the bad-guy immigration supervisor who has made it his personal crusade to keep Tom Hanks from setting foot on American soil. This lends an air of incredulity to the whole thing, because you get the sense that Hanks is not being kept prisoner due to a bureaucratic mix-up, but due to a small, petty man who would never have so much power in reality. Language barrier or not, it is completely unrealistic to think that anyone would simply sit in an airport for months without trying to contact diplomatic channels, other immigration offices, or even his family or friends back home.<br/><br/>The acting is appalling, unfortunately, considering the talent lined up in the movie. There are some fun peripheral characters, but they just adopt the stereotypes of amusing foreigners without ever seeming real. Catherine Zeta-Jones is ridiculous as Hanks's love interest, playing a character that anyone in their right mind would run away from in a heartbeat. The romance between the two is phony and contrived.<br/><br/>Most importantly, this movie had a chance to really say something - about immigration laws, about red tape, about institutionalization... about pretty much anything. Unfortunately, it chose to turn itself into a piece of fluff. And uninspired fluff at that.<br/><br/>Highly disappointing. 4/10."

It will not win any big awards and it's not a real must see but it is a very excellent and entertaining movie to watch.<br/><br/>I think that it are only two things that make this movie work; Tom Hank's acting and Steven Spielberg's directing. Hanks returns to his roots, that of a comedy actor. He shows that he still is a very talented and great character comedy actor. Spielberg's directing makes this movie a light one to watch. It is filled with some typical and good as ever trademark Spielberg kind of humor and some realistic and yet enjoyable characters. Stanley Tucci really plays excellent in this movie!<br/><br/>Main problem with ""The Terminal"" is the story. It is filled with some rather big plot holes and in a way most of it is predictable and clichÃ©. It's like they said; 'Hey we've got Spielberg directing and Hanks starring in the main role, who needs a waterproof story!?'. In a way it doesn't really matter, it doesn't make the movie less enjoyable to watch but it just prevents it from being a perfect and a must see movie.<br/><br/>All in all a very enjoyable movie with some good comical moments and characters but not one of the must sees of 2004.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","(Warning - This review contains some spoilers) How refreshing. A new Hollywood film that doesn't seem like a new Hollywood film. The only connection here is that it's a product of modern cinema, but it has absolutely nothing in common with other new releases.<br/><br/>A lot of modern films have a certain '2-dimensional' quality to them. They appear flat and weak, with the cinematography appearing uninspired, rather, just a way to see the action.<br/><br/>'The Terminal' on the other hand is a wonderful addition to the times. The story is vibrant and heart-wrenching. There are touches of strong humor, sadness, realism, individualism, and friendship, along with many other themes. The acting is top class throughout, with special credit going, of course, to Tom Hanks. This film is just more proof that he is one of the greatest actors of modern times. There is a real vulnerability to Viktor Navorski, and yet, a certain strength as well. The acting is superb. We empathize with the character. He can project such humor, and also such intense sadness and isolation. Wonderful.<br/><br/>Catherine Zeta-Jones is also fantastic here. Her character takes the film away from standard film conventions, and introduces something new. She fits perfectly into the role of Amelia Warren, and acts as a wonderful contrast to Hanks. The two are strong when with each other, and equally strong without.<br/><br/>The friendship that forms between Navorski and the other workers adds a wonderful element to the film. These scenes provide some of the most heart-wrenching moments that we see. I have my own little soft spot for Gupta Rajan (played by Kumar Pallana), and the way the character is portrayed. Very well done. (Also, a mention for Frank Dixon, played by Stanley Tucci - wonderful).<br/><br/>The cinematography is soft and subtle, unlike a lot of modern cinema, which provides a welcome change in pace.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is without a doubt, the best film of the year that I have seen so far. Everything from visual to sound to subtleties - everything is put together incredibly well. We are left with a truly amazing, inspiring, little film."

","The Terminal has 90 minutes of good film in it. Each and every scene is beautifully directed by Spielberg, the camera direction is pretty impressive!! The storyline is also good.. as are a lot of the scenes. However, as much as The Terminal has good things about it.. there are also bad things..<br/><br/>Spielberg should have got a decent producer, like Michael C. Gross to slap him or hit him in the face with an iron wrench for every minute that he goes over 90. Basically this movie contains a lot of un-necessary scenes, which draws it out far too much. I got extremely restless after an hour and a half and just when I thought the movie was about to end, it carried again and again. Maybe this is a Spielberg flaw.. the fact that he feels every character that Hanks meets should have his/her own storyline. Nobody cares about them!! And what was with Catherine Zeta Jones.. nobody could possibly believe in a romance between her and Hanks.. thats just bad casting. Now, MAYBE if it was an actress who nobody knows about who isn't that great looking, that would be a lot more viable. And a lot cheaper to pay too!<br/><br/>And what was with a female custom officer marrying a food trucker who she never even met before!! That was so ridiculous and un-necessary to the narrative of the movie. If The Terminal cut out all of these stupid scenes it would be a pleasurable 90 minutes which would please everyone.. So Mr Spielberg please bear that in mind for your next movie!<br/><br/>Conclusively.. The Terminal is good.. but so long that the quality of this movie is diluted severely. 6/10"

Mr. Speilberg (Steve you're one of the best directors out there, but romantic comedies just aren't your forte) couldn't even save this stinker!

"clydestuff","7","1","3","26 July 2004"," Entertaining throughout, but doesn't add up to much
","Having been around a few airport terminals in my time, I can safely say that it's a place that I only visit out of necessity, and sure is hell would never think of living in one.  I've been lucky enough not to have been stuck interminably in between flights or delayed more than a few hours, and will be eternally grateful to the powers that be for that.  I can't imagine having to spend a whole day in an airport, and the thought of having to take up residence in one for several days is almost as abhorrent to me as the thought of having to clean out a construction site porta-pot. <br/><br/>
In The Terminal, our mythical hero Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from the mythical land of Krakozia lands in the not so mythical J.F.K. airport. While Viktor was in the air, getting from there to here, Krakozia undergoes a coup.  Because of this, Viktor technically has no country to return to, and since the U.S. doesn't recognize the new mythical regime, his passport and visa are no longer valid and are confiscated by mythical security chief Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who then tells Viktor he can't leave the airport and enter New York City and must not leave the International Arrivals Lounge.  Of course Frank expects Viktor to do what just about anyone else would and leave anyway, but Viktor does as he is told and stays at the airport, and stays and stays and stays and stays and stays etc.  It doesn't help matters that Viktor doesn't understand but a few words of English, that his money is no longer any good, and that it takes him about five minutes to lose all of his food vouchers.  I think it's called having your back up against the wall.<br/><br/>Viktor finally makes a few friends at the airport including a janitor, a food service worker, an INS agent who stamps his permission to leave with a big red declined every day, and develops a crush on the beautiful Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an airline hostess having an affair with a married guy (Michael Nouri).  How Viktor copes and learns to live is kind of sweet, often funny, and sometimes sad.  The fact that we buy any of this at all can be laid squarely on the shoulders of Tom Hanks who gives a remarkable performance as Viktor.  Not only does his accent stay consisted, his broken English never falters one bit as he learns phrases by comparing his Krakozia tour book to the exact same one written in English.  He keeps Viktor consistent throughout, a simple man whose one desire is to be able to enter New York to fulfill a promise kept in a peanut can he carries from place to place.  Viktor is the kind of person Frank Dixon doesn't understand, can't understand, and yet in some small way perhaps envies him because he is able to relate to people in ways that Frank will never be able to.<br/><br/>Of course much of what happens in The Terminal is far-fetched (although supposedly loosely based on a true story) but since this is fairy-tale land I guess it's supposed to be.  Viktor acts as a go between in helping develop a relationship between the INS agent Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) and the food service worker Enrique (Diego Luna), both of whom end up being devout trekkies.  Relationships have been built on less though as witnessed by Amelia who has been hanging out with the married guy for several years waiting for him to leave his wife.  As Viktor develops his own relationship with her, it is both touching and sweet, and we root for them.  Viktor eventually does find a job at the airport in a sequence that seems written more out of convenience for the plot than any other reason.<br/><br/>Credit also has to be given to the writers and Spielberg for being able to pace a two hour film that takes place in an airport terminal in just the right way so that it is interesting and seldom bogs down.  I never felt like it was two hours which is saying quite a bit when you think of what two hours at the airport really feels like. <br/><br/>There are some truly warm and fuzzy moments in The Terminal, some pretty good laughs, a few good enough if not spectacular performances by the cast (other than Hanks who is excellent), and several entertaining characters. Yet when it is over, you'll still leave the theater asking, `So what?'  A lot of the reason for this is that we get an ending you'll find only partially satisfying.  Some may quibble that if Spielberg had given us everything we wanted, than it wouldn't have been true to the story or the characters.  In answer to that I can only say hey, if you're going to give us two hours of what is basically a modern day fairy tale, you can at least give your audience what you know they want to see.  If a totally satisfying ending is good enough for Mother Goose, it should be fine for Spielberg's fairy tale as well.  I still may have left saying, `So what?' but I would have felt better about asking the question.  All in all, it's an entertaining enough way to spend two hours, but it's just one of those films that in the end isn't memorable enough to make it worth a trip to a theater, yet is good enough that you would probably want to watch it on DVD in the comfort of your living room at some point in time.   And if the only thing I can recommend is that people see your film on DVD, I have no choice but to give you my grade and for The Terminal that's a B-."

Yeah, yeah, it's supposed to be a ""modern day fairy tale""... well, even fairy tales need to have people in them... and not these fake representations of humanity.  It's like that stupid boy with the fishing pole in that annoying Dreamworks logo... it's a fake, idealized image of some kind of movieland childhood that never did exist in the real world.  I think this movie would have been a lot better if it wasn't being so ""cute"" all the time.  The best scene is one where the head of airport security (Stanley Tucci) has to come to Tom Hanks' ""man without a country"" to help him translate for a crazed, knife-wielding foreigner.  I think the relationship between Hanks and Tucci needed to be a lot more adversarial to make the movie work.  Mostly, it's on the level of Hogan against Col. Klink in the old ""Hogan's Heroes"" shows.  Tucci's character is merely dislikable when he should be despised.  And Catherine Zeta-Jones?  What kind of fake, ludicrous, nonsensical hook-up is this?  What could anyone possibly see in this neurotic adulteress?   And why, oh why, do all Spielberg's latest movies have to keep going on and on after the perfect fade-out moment?

Tom hanks portrayal of Viktor Navorski is great and very believable. These characters kept the movie interesting.<br/><br/>The subplot between Enrique, Office terres(Zoe Saldana) and Tom hanks was the best of the movie. I throughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The dinner scene between Tom hanks and Catherine zeta Jones has everything you ask for in a movie. Gupta was really funny and stole the show in lot of scenes.<br/><br/>Things I don't like(WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!!)<br/><br/>It was hard to believe that Frank Dixon, head one of the busiest airport had nothing but follow Viktor around and meddle with him. More over, if he wants to know what is in the Peanut box that Viktor is carrying, all Frank has to do was- ASK!!! yes, we all know airport authority can strip you naked. All frank has to do is ask Viktor-- OPEN THAT DAMN PEANUT BOX.<br/><br/>Viktor navorski character although very good and acted well is a simple plain look from American point of view. We were never taken into his world. He just moves around and does things to amuse us. No real sense of insight into a man who is stuck(delayed forever!) in airport. Although he comes a stubborn character, it was hard to believe that he was just contend to live there and not try more to get out.<br/><br/>As the movie progressed, it became stale, predictable and boring. If all Viktor wanted was a signature from a Jazz legend. Viktor could have asked some of his admirers in the airport to get the signature for him since he knows where the jazz legend plays. It's hard to believe that it did not occur to intelligent Viktor. Sentimentality at its height. So the climax and ending was kind-off lame.<br/><br/>OK. I know this is a very ""small"" Hollywood type movie but it could've been more plausible and entertaining. Very nice story but not executed well.<br/><br/>If you don't worry about logic, plausibility etc...you might be able to sit through this movie once."

His good naturedness led me to believe it was benign and not a security threat. Unfortunately there was no way to guess what that purpose was before he told Amelia toward the end.<br/><br/>Frank Dixon was unscrupulous yet likable enough to get ahead career-wise. He was concerned about Viktor's can but to make himself look good was willing to let him go and take a chance that other authorities would arrest him.  Little wonder why we have security problems.

Unfortunately attention was diverted from most impressive one when Amelia got up and left the table.  The tricks reminded me of something from the early days of television. <br/><br/>Hanks' dialect and accent were terrific, reminiscent of Sid Caesar. <br/><br/>
The romance by proxy between Enrique and Officer Torres was not believable under any circumstances, and I was scratching my head wondering if the makers of the movie intended for Torres to be Hispanic or African-American.<br/><br/>The character of Amelia was all too believable, and her slipping back into her old ways after being touched so deeply by Viktor caused me to side with those who considered this movie a disappointment.  <br/><br/>5 out of 10."

","When a project involves such giants as Spielberg and Hanks one would expect the best caliber from these two capable artists. What they've created instead is very average in many respects. The plot is forced and clumsy and the story doesn't wrap up in a satisfying way. This could have been a typical ""comedy of errors"" formula or a volley of wit vs. wit between Hanks' character and Stanley Tucci's. But there's only a hint of these traits. There's nothing inventive about the production, storytelling, or directing. Spielberg throws in the towel on this one. I don't believe Hanks as a doe-eyed lovable non-English-speaking punching bag who knows only enough English to be slightly funny. He's more creepy then lovable. There's nothing convincing in any of the relationships neither between Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones nor any secondary characters. The movie is more frustrating then anything. I don't believe that any normal human being caught in those situations would remain so meek for so long. And if anyone does then they deserve what they get. For me one of the biggest disappointment in this movie is John William's contribution. His decision to go small scale was good, but the music he wrote for this has no personality. If the creative team here were any other people I'd give this a 6 out of 10. But considering the quality of creators I give this a 4 out of 10."
"Zoopansick","3","1","3","27 June 2004"," The epitome of a fake Hollywood movie
","If you ever want to see an example of what modern independent film makers point to when they talk about superficial and false Hollywood movies see The Terminal. The Terminal is a highly implausible and manufactured story of this guy stuck in a New York Air Port for God only knows how long. This movie presents the audience with a series of unreal characters and situations and tries to pass it off as drama or romance. Consider the character that Stanley Tucci plays; why does he hate Victor Navorski so much? Is he really jeopardizing his chance to move up in the ranks? Is he even that annoying? It's really none of those reasons, the only reason he hates him is because the movie requires a villain. Just like the movie requires a stupid romance based on chance meetings. The Catherine Zeta Jones character is really pathetic too. She complains about being forced to wait for this guy for 7 years and being a stewardess for 20 years. Well it's her own fault. She choose to have an adulteress affair with a married man, and chose to keep waiting on him (here's a tip girls, if you have been going out with a married guy for more then 5 years and he hasn't left his wife yet, he isn't going to and you are getting played). I guess I can forgive her being a stupid character, because guess what that's not even the dumbest romance in the movie. That dubious honor goes to the one because the cute girl at the passport approval desk and the Hispanic guy who drives the food cart. In this whirlwind romance the guy wants to ask her out but is afraid to (ok nothing too out of the ordinary yet)...so he asks this guy from eastern Europe who has been stuck in the airport (and who he hardly knows) to find stuff out about her so that they can fall in love. The girl apparently just as stupid gives Tom Hanks all sorts of information and then without ever meeting the guy agrees to marry him after Tom Hanks gives her a ring. I don't know about you all but if I was working a desk job somewhere and some guy from Eastern Europe (or from anywhere really) starts asking me questions about myself and then one day gives me a ring and asks me to marry this other guy who I have never seen before in my life, I would have to respectfully decline. Along with this romance the movie has other stupid characters including this old Indian janitor (and just between you and me I wanted to see him get deported, and if Spielberg had any balls left show the 7-7 prison cell that old fart would be living in for the remainder of his days). The reason Tom Hanks came to America is a mystery (and I won't spoil it for you) but it's really stupid and definitely a movie contrivance. There are far more ridiculously implausible scenes in the movie, and none of which are very funny or heart warming. The Terminal is a movie with a ridiculous plot that could be found in a movie from the 20s or 30s without the charm. It's hard to believe that the guy who brought us such films as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and Schindler's List is reduced to this."

","Tom Hanks, not the problem. The supporting cast, not the problem. I hated the ending, our Hero deserved better. And our Lady in distress, I never thought for a minute she would leave her lover for our Hero. That is where this movie messed up the ending.  It was like watching fireworks shoot into the sky with no bursts of brilliant color. Very disappointing. Director Steven Spielberg is far too interested in walking the line between cute and believable. Victor is basically a human E.T., and we're supposed to laugh as he seems all too happy to be stuck in the airport doing funny stuff, like make cracker sandwiches with ketchup and mustard and make small talk with an INS agent so that he can pass on information to her love-smitten would-be suitor Enrique in exchange for dinner. In other words: ""Do tricks for food."" I didn't think Spielberg could sink this low."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","3","24 June 2004"," America is closed.
","When I first saw the theatrical trailer for The Terminal recently, I was initially worried about the fact that Tom Hanks takes on such a heavy accent, since his character is from Krakozia (sp?) and speaks only a few words of English. This is not, in my opinion, necessarily one of the hardest things for an actor to accomplish (because I think a lot of the road to success is paved by the audience's ability to believe an actor with a new accent), but rather one of the hardest things for an audience to accept. A well known actor taking on a different accent or, in this case, a completely different nationality and language, tends to call attention to the man or woman on screen talking so differently from how we are used to hearing them. Tom Hanks, nevertheless, pulls it off flawlessly, once again demonstrating the sheer vastness of his screen presence and acting skill.<br/><br/>
Spielberg once again delivers an immensely moving story about a man trying to get home, a theme that he clearly loves, since just about every movie he's ever made boils down to that theme. The reverberations and reflections of the things that are going on in the world today are impossible to miss, which is why it shocked me to read one reviewer on the IMDb refer to The Terminal as a light-hearted romp. Yes, it's a lot of fun, it's amusing, endearing and charming, but it's also extremely powerful in a very serious way. It features the second most direct and blatant impersonation of government officials working in America today, second only to the replica of Dick Cheney in The Day After Tomorrow. Stanley Tucci plays the part of an customs and immigration official, whose charge to look after national security matters at a major airport disquietingly echoes much of what is going on in America today. The little American flag that he always wears on his lapel is far too similar, in size, shape, and location, to the one that George W. Bush always wears to possibly be a coincidence.<br/><br/>The story is remarkably simple. Tom Hanks plays the part of Viktor Navorski, a man who has traveled to New York for reasons that are revealed near the end of the movie, and while he is on the plane to New York, his country falls into a military coup and basically ceases to exist, leaving Viktor without a country and without a valid passport, and thus nowhere to go but the terminal. He can't set foot in America and he can't go back to his country until it establishes a government recognized by America. He is a perfectly innocent illegal alien who has fallen through a loophole in what is meant to be the most sophisticated national security system in the world. And since I live here, I like to think that it really is.<br/><br/>The movie walks a very fine line between sadness and comedy, since Viktor's hardships tug the heartstrings so much but the movie itself is so funny, and these two emotions are woven together to create an unusually strong bond with the character who, like Chuck Noland in Cast Away, is basically stuck on a deserted island and left to his own resources to survive. Chuck Noland had to literally live off the land for years, Viktor Navorski now has to survive in an isolated location, surrounded by capitalism, indifferent Americans in a hurry to catch their flight or get home, and a bureaucracy that increasingly wishes he would just disappear. <br/><br/>As Viktor proves to be capable of following the rules that were laid out for him (and in a language that he could hardly understand), Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) grows increasingly impatient, which leads to the most biting criticism that the movie makes of the way the American government handles the maintenance of national security at our airports and, presumably, beyond. Viktor is stuck in a terrible situation, and Dixon does little to make it easy on him. He explains to him that he can't leave the airport until further notice, and then forgets about him until it turns out that he is doing exactly what he is told. Here you have a national security officer who is faced with a timid and exceedingly polite foreigner who he can't allow to step onto American soil, and because he is obeying all the rules set out for him, Dixon doesn't have a clue in the moon what to do.<br/><br/>From this point on, Dixon does everything from explaining to Viktor that for a specific five minutes, a specific door into America will be left completely unguarded and available for easy escape to planning to basically pass him on someone else. Release him, but just enough so that someone else will catch him and then he'll be someone else's problem. Dixon can't arrest him unless he breaks some law, and Viktor is apparently entirely unwilling to break any law, even to pass into America unlawfully when the man in charge of the airport's security has instructed him to do so.<br/><br/>While living in the terminal, Viktor sets up his own little living space in an area of the airport that is under construction, and he gradually becomes known throughout the airport. There is a particular scene involving a Russian man who needs to take medicine to his dying father, but Dixon insists that the prescription drugs must remain in America until the proper red tape can be processed, and Viktor diffuses the situation in a tense scene which makes him a hero throughout the entire airport. How everyone heard about it I'm not entirely sure.<br/><br/>There are also numerous smaller stories that take place as a result of Viktor being stuck in the airport. Catherine Zeta-Jones passes through the movie on a wispy strand of a plot involving a flight attendant who is having an emotionally destructive relationship with a married man, and as she and Viktor grow closer and closer together, although not quite close enough for a whole date, she goes back to the married man that has been causing her all kinds of pain, disappearing into his arms and out of the movie. There is a charming Indian janitor named Gupta, who is unable to go back to his country for reasons that are slightly hinted at by the extent of the pleasure he gets from seeing people take nasty spills from walking across his wet floors. Then there is a food services employee who befriends Viktor in hopes that he can help him to win the heart of one of the women working at the immigration office, which seems to be the story put in to balance out the ones involving Catherine Zeta-Jones and Gupta, who suffers a rather unfortunate fate that is never shown.<br/><br/>The Terminal is a simple story that moves along quickly and efficiently because the script and Hanks' acting make us care so much about the character of Viktor Navorski that we really want to see how his story pans out, we really want everything to work out for him, even if some laws have to be broken along the way. Spielberg has been accused of being sappy many times, and if he is guilty of it in this movie, it is because of things like the portion of the movie that explains why Navorski was in America in the first place, but only because something that moving is not necessary in order for the audience to care enough about Viktor for the movie to be effective. <br/><br/>Viktor had us at `Krakozia!'"

","As the end credits rolled I wondered how much of Andrew Niccol's original idea remained in the final cut. I maybe wrong, but something tells me Niccol's vision might have been sharper, edgier. Because ""The Terminal"" comes off as just too fluffy for something he'd devise.<br/><br/>Although the film's inspired by the true story of an Iranian immigrant who's lived at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport since 1988, Steven Spielberg's made a slight comedy that doesn't contain an ounce of reality. It's occasionally amusing, if 25 minutes too long.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' Viktor is a lovable lug. He waddles through the international terminal at JFK Airport and ingratiates himself with the people. Hanks fits the role well - then again, he could play these earnest guys in his sleep. It's nothing we haven't seen from him before.<br/><br/>Catherine Zeta-Jones does capably as Amelia Warren, a flight attendant who keeps bumping into Viktor. The problem with Zeta-Jones is that whatever role she plays, be it a cat burglar or a musically inclined jailed murderess, the audience is always aware that it's the Zeta-Jones on the screen. She never wholly envelops a role.<br/><br/>Throughout ""The Terminal"" I kept wondering what another actress, one with more dramatic depth, say, Michelle Pfeiffer or Uma Thurman, might have done with Amelia, how much more resonant and engaging the Viktor-Amelia relationship might have been.<br/><br/>There's some fine supporting work from Kumar Pallana as Gupta, the Indian janitor, and Barry Shabaka Henley, as an airport security officer.<br/><br/>Despite some giant plot holes, the film works when it occasionally delves into the other world that exists within the airport - this subterranean netherworld of baggage handlers, construction workers, food service people, janitors, customs officials and late-night poker games.<br/><br/>But there aren't any moments in this film that feel real. This is all fantasy - from improbable romances to lapses in logic to the ""Oh well, aw shucks"" denouement. (By the way, this film has too many endings.)<br/><br/>This JFK airport doesn't seem as frenetic a place as it should be; the only bit of anguish is early in the film when Viktor rushes from one TV screen to another looking at war footage from his homeland and being unable to find out what's happening.<br/><br/>Spielberg gives the film such an airy feel that he misses golden opportunities to comment about how airports have essentially turned into malls where planes fly out and land, as well our treatment of immigrants these days, especially if they're Arab. There's absolutely no sense of a post-9/11 America in this airport. One line of dialogue briefly hints about the issue: Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the acting chief of airport security, says, ""They've detained so many people there's no room anywhere"" when he fails to get Viktor sent to a federal detention center.<br/><br/>""Compassion is the foundation of this country,"" a character tells Dixon. We know that's not always the case post-9/11. But this film is so enraptured by its manufactured whimsy that it doesn't care to probe the issue any deeper, even in the background.<br/><br/>One thing you will notice: how prominently Burger King, Borders and United Airlines feature throughout the massive set that was built. Ya gotta love product placement. (Maybe it will help United crawl out of bankruptcy.)<br/><br/>This comedy doesn't pack huge laughs. Instead, it opts for occasionally amusing vignettes that might make you smile. It's not a terrible way to spend time (""Connie and Carla"" anyone?), but it could have been much more rewarding and less disappointing, considering the tremendous talent involved in front of and behind the camera. A bit more reality and a little less fable would have worked wonders without losing any of the story's magic."

","I can not ignore major, obvious holes in a movie's plot, especially when they effect the rest of the movie. These two questions will summarize my complaint: 1.) Why why were the I.C.E. agents talking to Navorsky when they knew he could not understand English? and most importantly, 2.) How did he know to stay in the airport terminal when he could not understand English?<br/><br/>The director (Spielberg) did not care enough about The Terminal to patch these holes. I think it's ridiculous to waste movie-goers' time. Besides this major complaint, I also found Hank's character dull and un-compelling. I am not knowledgeable in affairs of immigration and customs, but I find it difficult to believe that I.C.E would create such an uncontrolled situation by releasing this man into the terminal without employing an interpreter to inform him of his situation. It's too bad, because with an intelligent script re-write, we could have had something special."

Oh no, you haven't bombed it yet). This license is in Belarus language and the owner of this licence is a women whose name Gulina is translated as Navorski. A good sense of humor. Here in Belarus we enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, I did not wait much from Spielberg's film. Spielberg is a sort of the king about whom a child would cry ""The King Is Naked!"" So I was not disappointed too much. What I can say...it's just a funny feel-good comedy. Nothing more. It did not flipped my world over (like ""Forrest Gump"" did).

","Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorski, a man without a country who lives in ""The Terminal,"" a 2004 film directed by Steven Spielberg. While Viktor is en route to the U.S. to fulfill a wish of his late father's, there is a coup in the Eastern European country he calls home. When he lands at JFK airport, he finds he cannot enter the U.S. because his country is no longer recognized by the U.S., and all flights home have been canceled. While waiting in this limbo, Viktor takes up residence in the Terminal, to the chagrin of one of the administrators (Stanley Tucci) for whom Viktor is becoming somewhat of an embarrassment.<br/><br/>This is a delightful film, if a bit too long, about the true meaning of home, about resourcefulness, and how a dream can propel a person to keep going no matter the odds. There are some funny scenes such as one of the custodial people, Gupta, watching people slide across his wet floors, Viktor taking apart seats at Gate 67 to make a bed, walking across the terminal in his bathrobe, and gathering luggage wagons so he can turn them in for quarters (he lost the food vouchers he was given). A brilliant contractor in his own country, Viktor even finds work in the terminal when his talent is recognized by the boss of one of the crews doing repairs on the building.<br/><br/>Viktor makes many friends at the Terminal and even falls in love with a flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is attached to a married man and can't seem to break it off. That and the peanut can that Viktor carries around with him make up the poignant parts of the story.<br/><br/>The performances are wonderful. Hanks is a true Everyman as Viktor and really gives one the feel for what it's like to be alone in a strange place and not know much of the language. In one sad moment, he watches the TV monitors and cries as he realizes his country is in trouble. Viktor is a smart man as well as being a grounded and basic one. As with all his other roles, Hanks sails through the part, making it look both believable and easy. Zeta-Jones is a stunning and vivacious Amelia who sees Viktor's true worth even as she is pulled in another direction by a dead end relationship. Stanley Tucci, an airport administrator to whom Viktor has become an embarrassment, does an excellent job portraying a rules-only mindset and the disconnect between his job and the people he's supposed to serve. In one of the most powerful scenes, he refuses to let a man into the country with medicine for his dying father because the correct forms weren't filled out in the man's country of origin. All of the supporting characters who learn the meaning of true friendship from Viktor - Cruz, Gupta, et al. are fantastic.<br/><br/>""The Terminal"" is a real feel-good movie, beautifully directed and acted, touching and engrossing. Highly recommended for the smile it will leave on your face."

","Viktor Navorski is a man without a country - literally. On the very day his plane touches down at JFK, Viktor learns that a coup has occurred back in his fictional home country of Krakozha. Among other inconveniences, this international crisis renders his passport invalid until the United States government agrees to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the destabilized country's new leadership. Until then, Viktor remains a virtual prisoner in the terminal, unable to leave the premises and forced to live under the watchful eye of airport security. There's a certain irony in the fact that Viktor, who was presumably raised in a draconian communist country, becomes the ultimate victim of a de-humanized bureaucracy and a mountain of red tape the minute he sets foot on American soil. From that moment on, he has to find a way to survive in this strange new environment, but eventually he learns to make the airport his home, winning friends and wooing a love interest (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) into the bargain.<br/><br/>Certainly, there are those who will find this fable about a simple man, trapped somewhere between the worlds of Capra and Kafka, heartwarming and charming. All I can say is that I found it, for the most part, aggravatingly contrived and cutesy, too infatuated with its own premise to develop a sustainable storyline. The problem begins with Tom Hanks who has milked the Average Joe/ Mr. Nice Guy shtick so much throughout his long career that it has long since lost any impact it once might have had. Adding a cutesy Eastern European accent to the brew just makes the performance all that more insufferable. In essence, Victor is reduced to little more than a ""man/child,"" hardly a character worth developing a full length, tour de force feature film around.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, who normally can do no wrong as a director, for some reason is unable to make an effective go of things here. Could it be because Spielberg handles sentiment well when he's working in a generally unsentimental genre like science fiction where he has some built-in tension to work off of, but that when he's dabbling in a highly sentimental genre like romantic comedy, he runs out of energy and vision? He's done a terrific job recreating an entire functioning airport terminal on a soundstage, but none of that really matters very much when we begin feeling as trapped inside the setting as Viktor himself does. Throughout the whole movie, I just kept wishing Viktor would bust his way through the terminal doors and find his way into a more interesting story. Almost all the secondary characters are shallow, stereotypical and uninteresting, while Stanley Tucci's nasty little airport manager is not only annoying and repulsive but completely incomprehensible from a psychological point of view.<br/><br/>""The Terminal"" is one of those movies that is so impressed with its own sweetness and goodness that it winds up patronizing all the ""little people"" it thinks it's celebrating. This is a film strictly for those who actually enjoy being stuck at the airport."

","Director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) because of his long success with film-making has permission to direct pretty much anything he wants, and this film certainly proves that. Basically Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks, in his third Spielberg film) from Krakozhia wants to go to New York, but a war in his country means it is unrecognised by the U.S., and with no correct identification, he cannot legally enter the United States, or go home, until the war is over. For now, Viktor must live in the JFK airport terminal and not leave the building, so he adapts and sets up residence in the airport, and this is making the man who put him there, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) very unhappy, and Navorski in the airport could complicate his chances of a promotion. He tries a few ways to get Viktor to leave, but he remains where he is surviving on left over food, until of course he gets help from new friends in the airport staff, Joe Mulroy (Chi McBride), Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna) and Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana), who help him to survive. Over the time he is in the airport, who also once in a while bumps into flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta- Jones), who is hopelessly waiting for her boyfriend to come back to her, so they are both ultimately waiting for something, and even though they get close, they cannot be together. Eventually, the war does end in Viktor's home country, but Frank refuses to let him go to New York and fulfil his promise to his father, he also threatens to fire all his friends because of their disrespect to rules and regulations, but thankfully Gupta delays the plane and Viktor finally heads for the doors to America, and even Frank's right hand Ray Thurman (Patch Adams' Barry 'Shabaka' Henley) lets him go. A happy ending when he finally gets the signature of the final member of a classic jazz group. Also starring Zoe Saldana as Dolores Torres. Hanks is superb with accent and emotions of all situations put in front of him, Zeta-Jones has her moments, Tucci is a great power-hungry villain-type, and there are some gags and dramatic moments to be had. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, Catherine Zeta-Jones was number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 39 on The 100 Worst Britons.

"Luluhalabaloo","5","1","5","21 May 2005"," Simple children's fable uselessly made into PG-13
","This movie is exactly what I expected. A foreign traveler is forced to stay in the airport while his passport/visa is sorted out. I heard of the story a long time ago and found it interesting even then. But, I suspect that the real story is stranger than fiction as usual, and finally am disappointed with the film for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is good in this film. He looks the part: a simple, fretful, not particularly stunning individual who cannot speak the language. But I wonder if there wasn't a bit of stereotyping that is somewhat passé here, which become tiresome rather quickly. In fact, all the characters seem to have been a product of generic outlining, without nuance or distinctly humanistic individualism.<br/><br/>For example, Amelia the Stewardess fit into most of our collective impressions of what a stewardess is all about. As in Catch me if you Can, the Stewardess is a pretty, young, somewhat vapid but adventuresome girl who is not a mother, a daughter or a wife. I wonder if Mr. Spielberg has something about stewardesses! But to be serious, Amelia was a not a disappointment as she acted the stewardess stereotype. And her final act had nothing to do with ""sacrificing herself"" for Viktor, but rather as an apology for hurting Viktor by returning to her married lover. And that's all, folks.<br/><br/>I loved the Indian Janitor. He was funny. One wonders how many times people throw up in the middle of floors judging by the number of ""wet floor"" signs appear in obscure, right-in-the-way places. From now on, I will look for the janitor watching! But some questions: so why did he walk out to get caught? He didn't know that security knew what he was all about  which brings me to a second question: why hadn't they deported him till now? The Indian came to America to escape what he had to face back home. It was cowardly, and he knew it, but lived with it and became wary and unfulfilled. Viktor retained his dignity and honesty but not admitting he feared his homeland in order to get out of the terminal, and this was inspiring to the Janitor, and he decided to do the right thing and head home. I don't believe he ""sacrificed"" himself in order to keep Viktor from being deported. And that says more about Viktor's character, and the janitor's for that matter, than the ""sacrifice"" idea.<br/><br/>The romance between the customs agent Torres and Luna is funny  first, her name  Torres, from Star Trek Voyager - and she is a ""trekkie"", as is he. So now we know that they are riding on a different cloud than us, and that ""trekkie"" thing is apparently pretty darn important. So love at first ring shouldn't be so strange  it's just that she doesn't ""look"" like a typical ""trekkie"" convention goer, I guess, and usually girls that stunning don't go for immigrant food handlers...but maybe that's just observation and experience talking. It certainly was optimistic! Viktor's ode to Amelia of the fountain was just plain weird. Why didn't it work? Because it represented how the relationship would never work, I suppose, or foreshadowed how he would never be able to make the relationship work, but it seemed like a big waste of film time  I didn't get much out of it, and frankly, it looked ugly.<br/><br/>And then, finally, Viktor's reason for coming to America  to get a signature for his dad. A lot of money for a poor country guy to fly to America for one hour or so to get a signature and fly home. Now that is the most unrealistic thing I have ever heard. If you are going to work all your life (which judging by Viktor's clothes and demeanor, it looks like he wasn't wealthy) for a ticket to America and then stay for an hour, that was just plain unbelievable. Perhaps it was supposed to smack of the chicness of Catch Me if You Can, but it failed and wasn't a surprise ending.<br/><br/>This wasn't a film that really caught the real story behind the strangeness of a scenario where a man is caught between countries. It didn't catch it and exploit the ludicrousness of the situation, or the comical take on it either. The film seemed to straddle between children's fable and simplistic entertainment. From the simple no-goodness of the security chief to the simple sweetness of the big security guy, this was not a film that would tickle anyone's intellectual funny bone, and frankly, I don't think it was intended as such. If the few swear/sexual words uttered by the inglorious Amelia and the drug smuggling scene were cut out, this could have been a good teaching movie for kids."

","This movie was just awful. The plot to the movie seems interesting at first glance, but it's obvious that the writers had trouble when it came to making the movie into anything good beyond that. Tom Hanks is traveling to NY from his Eastern European homeland when a revolution breaks out and his country is no longer recognized by the U.S. He is therefore stuck in the airport, not allowed to enter the New York, and not allowed to fly out since they are forced to confiscate his passport.<br/><br/>The movie then fills up the next 2+ hours with ridiculous characters and the antagonist is painted to be unnecessarily evil while hanks is continuously painted as a saint. Then a number of other characters are introduced just to fill up the time. If you think too hard about anything that goes on, this movie is just ridiculous: marriage proposals by people that have never met, Hanks is hated and dogged by the 'bad guy' for absolutely no reason, Zeta-Jones asks Hanks out on a date 30 seconds after breaking up with her 'affair' of 7 years, the food supplier seems to work 24 hours a day and is able to leave just about anytime he wants to talk to Hanks, an Indian janitor runs out to a plane to stop it with a mop because Hanks is such a savior,nobody can seem to understand that Hanks can't speak English and instead of getting a translator they just continue to waste their time talking to him... it goes on and on. This movie just wouldn't end and the loosely glued together coincidences just get worse and worse.<br/><br/>This really has to be one of the worst disappointments I have ever seen. The ending just dragged, the relationship between Hanks and Zeta-Jones is completely vacuous and in the end just seems to act as another tool to show how saintly Hanks' character is. I hate movies that create unrealistic protagonists and antagonists, and this is one of those movies.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is just a mess! What a waste of time."

The character is stranded for an entirely different reason in an entirely different airport with an entirely different ending.  It's offensive in that it uses the 'story' to denigrate American authority, showing it to be inhuman and unfeeling.

","Tom Hanks dons a thick sorta-Russian accent on his way to a life of legal limbo, operating in perpetuity from his suitcase in an airport terminal. It's got the seed of an interesting story, and no shortage of talent to see it through, but fails to click in even the most remote sense. It's baffling to me that it's Spielberg in the director's chair here, because The Terminal is so bland, run-of-the-mill and pandering that it feels like the work of a tentative first-timer who's terrified to let the material breathe. The entire cast is painted with the broadest of strokes, from Hanks's childish, confused stranger in a strange land to Stanley Tucci's ridiculously scheming US Customs official, and I quickly grew tired of their telegraphed games. Weak and pointless, with a needlessly stretched runtime, it's dull, flaky space filler at best."

The start is nice enough with Viktor being trapped at the airport and trying to figure out what to do. But then a whole lot of Hollywood clichés come rolling in and even the good performances by many of the actors didn't quite save the movie from little mental groans in my head. It felt a bit as if the script writers and other movie makers had tried to recreate a feel-good movie from more innocent times. It surely worked for many people but did not quite work for me. Individual scenes made me laugh at loud, some others made me just wince slightly as another layer of sugary-sweet feel-good dressing was added to a formula recipe."

","'The Terminal' by Steven Spielberg is a rather cheap family movie with a dubious message. A man is caught in the midst of a changing political situation in his own country while arriving at JFK New York Airport and being left with no valid visa to enter the USA. For some strange reason he is shown the door to enter the International Lounge but not American soil. He is told to wait there and is willing to comply however long it may take. As you can expect passengers and crew come and go while the man with no country and almost no English accommodate himself to stay at the airport to the annoyance and amusement of the staff. He gets acquainted with some characters all quite out of ordinary. As the story unfolds, we learn that this unlucky delayed passenger has now lived at the airport for nine months and able to make a living there. We are also told that his only reason to come to New York is to get a signature from a jazz saxophonist to complete his father's treasured collection of such 57 autographs from other famous jazz musicians.<br/><br/>And here's the message for you: if you are a man of principles, you will do this to honour a pledge to your late father then immediately return to your own country without causing too much trouble to the immigration authorities. At the time of too many suspicious immigrants and travellers this should be seen as a most welcome outcome. The other benefit is for Tom Hanks' fans only. He is quite outstanding in his part but stands really alone in terms of quality. The director sadly serves too many contradictory purposes and achieves nothing but a family movie easy to forget."

","The terminal starts out very funny, however it starts getting very gay after the first 15 minutes when Tom Hanks enters the Egyptian restaurant in the airport. First of all, the menu items he suggests to the non-English-speaking waiter are not Egyptian, but more African. The decor in the restaurant is also more reminiscent of American-Indian, not Egyptian. I did laugh at the funny loss of translation between them, but for another 20 minutes the progression of the film seemed lackluster. 45 minutes through, however, there is a very funny bit when Hanks decides to start a bat-releasing business inside the terminal and offers free packages of sardines to every customer who wants a bat released. The whole cinema was in hysterics. All in all, aside from those hilarious sections, The Terminal was quite boring. The amount of gruesome violence, gore, and decapitating of passengers did not help to excite things whatsoever, and seemed totally unnecessary... I give this black comedy 4/10."
"itchyshoes77","5","1","6","14 August 2005"," Why Tom Hanks?
","This was an entertaining movie, but it would have been much nicer to see it directed by someone else, and played by an ACTUAL foreign actor. Much as Tom Hanks does an admirable job, it just irritates me to see Americans put on a generic ""foreign"" accent and walk funny, act funny, and just generally play an irritating twit and think that's what it means to be 'foreign'. It might go down well with the troops in Alabama, but in the rest of the world it's just offensive and to me it goes to the root of why America has a serious image problem in the world today. <br/><br/>Where is it written that if you are from ""Krakosia"" that you immediately take on some kind of a strange, ""old man"" gait like Hanks does in the film. Does he have hemorrhoids? Is he knocked-kneed? <br/><br/>And whether it's Spielberg or the writers who are responsible, the 'Commissioner' in this film is like a cartoon character. How or why could he possibly HATE Viktor so much? Not to mention all the secondary characters are like characters from Children's movies. There were moments (such as when Gupta, the Indian Janitor is telling Viktor's heroic tale) when I felt like I was watching the Goonies or ET again. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this film, but I probably will go check out the French version now, just because it is -irritating- when big American studios cast big American actors to play a very small, foreign character. For a foreigner, in this film Hanks' character has a remarkably American sense of humor. <br/><br/>Once again Spielberg falls just short of biting satire and descends into sentimental tripe."
"Ronin47","4","1","7","4 July 2004"," Spielberg and Hanks or no, this movie stinks (**)
","Whenever I'm watching a movie like ""The Terminal"", and all I can do is shake my head and roll my eyes while most of the audience laughs and claps, I always wonder if I'm just being a grump. Then I remember that, no, I don't consider myself a cynic, so it's something wrong with the movie. And boy, is there a lot wrong with this movie. <br/><br/>The first 30-40 minutes are actually quite good. Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, an immigrant from a fictional Eastern European country named Krakohzia who finds himself with an invalid passport upon his arrival in New York, and since he cannot set foot on America soil without a working passport, he is confined to the airport for an indeterminate time period. Hanks is, of course, great, and the swooping camerawork that follows him through the gigantic terminal with all the flashing lights, fast food and souvenir stores is excellent. We can feel Viktor's confusion and helplessness, and the hints he picks up about how to make life in an airport more tolerable are amusing. <br/><br/>Then the movie begins to wander, aimlessly. Lame subplots are brought in to pass the time, like Viktor playing matchmaker for a friendly airport employee (Diego Luna) and a predictably tough-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside INS agent (Zoe Saldana). This subplot is weak to begin with, then is dropped entirely for nearly an hour before wrapping up in a nauseatingly cutesy way. <br/><br/>That's the other major problem: the sappiness. Spielberg's always been eager to lay on the sappiness in many of his films, and it really kills ""The Terminal"". A very good and intelligent film could have been made with this story and cast (which also includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride and Kumar Pallana), but after the promising beginning it heads right into sappy, cliched, unrealistic nonsense. <br/><br/>Interestingly, it's loosely based on the true story of Iranian refugee Merhan Nasseri's experiences at France's Charles De Gaulle airport. I'm guessing that's VERY loosely. That is, unless Nasseri became a working class hero for the staff, had fun foiling the fussy jerk in head of security (Tucci) and had a starry-eyed romance with a flaky stewardess (Zeta-Jones) complete with cornball speeches in front of a gleaming, hand-made water fountain. <br/><br/>Yeah yeah, I know it's supposed to be whimsical. I still say there's a big difference between whimsy (which requires intelligence and a light touch) and a movie like ""The Terminal"" which irritatingly condescends to the audience by turning what could have been a fascinating film into a pandering, phony, mush-fest. <br/><br/>Hanks and Zeta-Jones are both quite good, but the movie itself is a huge waste of time. After the overrated ""Catch Me If You Can"" and this mess, maybe Spielberg should stay away from comedy."

I myself hated Forrest Gump, but this one comes close to being that bad. I harbor some doubts, in fact, as to the genuine directorship of this bottom-feeder production. Spielberg´s name is on so many projects, it could be that an assistant director did the heavy lifting here. An assistant director of substantially lower intelligence than Spielberg himself, who has churned out genuine masterpieces such as Schindler´s List, Munich, and Minority Report. The Terminal is not even in the same league as any of those works and is indeed so bad as to be embarrassing. Even if the plot and the characters and the clichés and stereotypes were not already bad enough, the musical score was pure torture to suffer through.

They just about get away with this absurd premise helped by supporting characters such as Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana and Zoe Saldana (playing a Star Trek fan before she ended up with a major role in the Star Trek films.)<br/><br/>If this had happened in real life, Vicktor would had been sent an immigration lawyer and an interpreter and would had got temporary admission to the United States.<br/><br/>However Spielberg does lapse into schmaltz frequently in this film and Dixon is a weak token villain of the piece."

","Anyone who has traveled by plane usually hates wait long at customs or passenger control, and can lose his composure with delays or baggage losses. In this case, the unfortunate passenger played by Tom Hanks will go through a bit of all that for having lost his own nationality, ending retained ""ad aeternum"" in New York airport terminal. Assuming that this film is a comedy with some romance, the idea is good, even if it seems little logic. Despite this promising start, the script ends up lost in trivialities and huge plot holes. One of the most egregious is the fact that Viktor, Tom Hanks' character, who hardly spoke a word of English, having learned so quickly the language. His story with Amelia (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) also does not fit in the rest of the film, so that is quickly cut with a simple and abrupt ending.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks deserves, however, congratulations. He was again perfectly up to his work. His character could be just a caricature of any citizen of the former USSR countries, but he managed to give it a very kind and patient soul, who easily conquers the public. Zeta- Jones had less luck with her character, poorly planned and poorly embedded in the plot but, nevertheless, made a decent and satisfying work. Stanley Tucci makes a good villain in the person of airport immigration director, Frank Dixon.<br/><br/>This film is pure entertainment, and it works very well in this light.

","First off, I want to mention I love airports & airplanes! They're my favorite means of traveling. <br/><br/>When I first saw this, I was 12 years old. I remember begging my Dad to watch the Incredibles again (even though it was gonna be in Japanese) but he insisted otherwise. So I went a long with it, seeing as how my Dad is a big Tom Hanks fan, just as I have become. ;) We watched this flick as a family and a whole bunch of friends - I remember it like it was yesterday. <br/><br/>Boy, did everything work together & right in this flick. It had everything it needed to be a good film! <br/><br/>First off, Tom Hank's foreign accent was very convincing - after all, he is a great actor! Stanley Tucci is great at playing the smart-alack-y & unlikable airport bully - liked him in ""Beethoven"" too. Catherine Zeta-Jones is excellent, as always, as the love interest; though actually I think she's prettier in the ""Zorro"" films.<br/><br/>A lot of the supporting characters are quite colorful & memorable too. Need I mention the beautiful Zoe Saldana? When I was sitting there in the theater, I was just captivated by how pretty she looked; and 10 years hasn't changed that at all. ;)<br/><br/>I enjoy the product placement as well; store after store. lol. John Williams' score is really memorable, beautiful, and uplifting too - I often listen to the main theme of the movie.<br/><br/>I also give credit to this movie for introducing me to Benny Golson.<br/><br/>So many scenes & lines in this movie still make me feel a range of emotions to this day.<br/><br/>Some of the memorable lines include: ""Bite to eat."" ""I hate the Tuesday!"" ""Do you have an appointment?"" ""He chit."" ""So we 'Cher' the panties?"" ""I wait!"" ""You touch it again, I kill you."" ""Goat."" ""I am delayed... long time."" ""Get lost."" ""What time? Dinner time.""<br/><br/>Amazingly, the entire ""terminal"" set was built inside of an old aircraft hanger! Kudos to Steven Spielberg for always proving to be amazing & creative.<br/><br/>I think my favorite scenes in this film are when Viktor finds out about the Quarters, when Viktor starts ordering from Burger King, when Gupta tells his story about India, the end credits with all the autographs of the people who made the movie (that was very unique), and when Gupta manages to stop the airplane with his mop! (Seriously, the music in that scene was really gripping my heart - I thought Gupta was gonna get killed by the plane.)<br/><br/>The only downside I've got with this film is the language - often times language takes me out of a film (whether it is 4-letter words or blasphemy). Plus, Tom Hanks' past is a little depressing, regarding how he wrote a beautiful letter at 16 years-old of how much he loved the Lord, and wanted to serve Him with his life; then he went off to college, studied false philosophy (i.e. Darwinian evolution) & likely destroyed his faith; as of now, he stars in movies with little or no morals. I'm just saying I feel sorry for him in that area.<br/><br/>But overall, people can enjoy this film! Great time, no alcohol required, and worth buying on Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>8/10"

This is my favorite Spielberg movie besides saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. The Terminal was a genius piece of work that had me laughing the whole time and crying at the end. I am a man, and I am telling you, get yourself checked if you didn't enjoy this because people, only Hanks can take something as annoying as living in an airport and make it look awesome. The Terminal is one of those classic that for me, will always be incredible."

","Laugh riot is one term i call this movie to be, but wait its not useless sit-com without a story. It has got one of the weird stories of all times and yet it has been characterized in an all too wonderful manner. The story was inspired by a real-life incident; however the script was modified so as to not match the actual incident itself, which is why i found this movie very very entertaining<br/><br/>Having said that, i would not call this a movie without life, this movie has lot of heart in it and in fact many times you would really feel moved by the innocence and ignorance displayed by the character. My family was in tears in many occasions and I wouldn't blame them for that. The end was really heart-warming finale however such episode of a stranded passenger without his fault in an airport is a situation that can only mean disaster and here despite being hero of the movie Tom Hanks is not spared.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a picture of JFK in its busy hours (which is always) and then an arrest just to show the audience the airport commanding officer is sharp, all set for the hero's arrival which based on his purpose of his visit should have been a cake walk but not so. From thereon the ordeal begins, first for the airport officials to make Mr. Victor understand what kind of deep crap he is in and then his flexible adaptability to counter attack the situation takes over. He turns every stone to make sure he survives as long as it takes and complete his mission<br/><br/>I have watched this movie at least 5 times and still there are a few scenes I could watch again and again. Those are the moments the director proves his brilliance and Tom Hanks his ace performance; and trust me there are so many. With every such short burst Tom Hanks starts creeping into your brain and when you think everything is resolved you would expect a standard trip with Kumbaya, but not to be. The director keeps you engaged until the last minute and even though his mission to visit America was very simple, yet noble the characters that are put in place in utilizing the hero with his best abilities (innocence). Of course the hero benefits from every possible source and wins our hearts with it.<br/><br/>Surely you cannot ask from the director or lead actor from more, this has got all the right ingredients of a well-accomplished movie. Catherina Zeta Jones, though has a very minuscule screen space, has justified her role and delivers a knock-out punch. The characters have been very well used by the director and almost every one of them has been given a closure, which completes the movie."
"alystacat","8","0","1","24 January 2014"," Amazing faceted film with a lot of flaws
","I love this film. There's a lot of flaws with it of course. i love Tom Hanks in this but I think they miscast. I think it would've been a lot better if it was an actual person of Eastern European descent. The subplots can be sappy. But the overall writing is amazing. There is a beautifully wrought sense of comradery and overwhelming odds. To me, I felt the airport was an metaphor for America itself. The security a metaphor for the government. Movies don't often choke me up but this one does, every time. In a way this movie was it's own version of Purgatory. I'm sure for some of the people watching it it seems as thus. But the underlying themes cannot be mistaken. Nonviolent peaceful resistance, making the best out of the most messed up situation you could possibly be in, and realizing all the people trapped with you have their own problems that need solved as well. A lot of people will say Schindler's List is Spielburg's best work, and I do agree for the most part. But if I had to choose between these two movies on a regular Saturday night? I'd pick the Terminal any day. And the Terminal really is as painful for me to watch as Schindler's List. The overall theme of dragging people down with rules, laws, and heartbreak over the name of some stupid security? It's just the fight against Nazism and totalitarianism in a different context. Ever notice how it feels that if Victor leaves the airport, he will end up in a concentration camp? I feel this way about the first half of the movie and by the second half I feel that the Terminal itself has become a concentration camp. The themes are easy to miss when shed in the light of a pretty flawed romanticomedy. Of course I read too much into it, as I always do. But yah, 2 thumbs up and a huge amount of respect for showing that the nice guy doesn't always finish last, that peaceful nonviolent resistance can really work, the woman you love isn't always going to be available and the answers to almost all your problems are in the local bookstore. Even if that bookstore is a sold out disgrace in a busy airport terminal. Adversity is something we all must face, all the time,especially in airports. Lovely film."

","I really didn't expect to enjoy this film. I let it pass me by without a second thought. Then it appeared on TV one boring afternoon and I watched it purely because there was nothing else on. <br/><br/>I mean - how good can a film about a guy in an airport terminal be?<br/><br/>Very, very good indeed. I really wanted a cup of tea during the movie and got as far as the end of the sofa a couple of times but there just wasn't a time when I wasn't keen to see what each scene revealed. <br/><br/>No spoilers here - you have to watch this film. It suits all ages and backgrounds, has few if any slow moments and perhaps the worst feature is Catherine Zeta-Jones (who is arguably the most beautiful woman in the world) so even that has it's compensation. If I'm honest it's not even her fault - she just has such competition in the film regarding acting and character. <br/><br/>I was blown away all over again by Tom Hanks, whom I would love to hate but just cannot in all honesty fault for many of his performances (from ""Big"" to ""Castaway"") but in particular this one. <br/><br/>I'm not an overly emotional man but this film put a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye whilst at the same time weaving moments of true laugh-out-loud comedy into the mix. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie, I wanted to watch it again.

","Marking the third collaboration between Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks after Saving Private Ryan & Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal is an intimately crafted, light-hearted, feel-good romantic comedy that benefits from Spielberg's assured direction & Hanks' heartwarming performance to make a smooth take off, stable flight & safe landing over the course of its runtime.<br/><br/>Inspired from a real-life event, The Terminal tells the story of Viktor Navorski who arrives at JFK airport from a politically unstable country only to find himself trapped at the terminal for his passport is no longer valid & he can't be deported back because of the outbreak of war in his homeland. Stuck at airport for an unspecified time, he ends up making this new place his temporary home.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, The Terminal is a surprisingly low-key film from the director who's second to none when it comes to blockbuster filmmaking. Yet what makes this story such a heartfelt fun ride is the amount of charm, affection & love it radiates in every frame. Spielberg's direction is very relaxed, the writing is sensible & the whole production is quite sound on technical level.<br/><br/>Production Design team does a spectacular job in replicating the entire airport for its set, Cinematography makes fab use of camera to pull the viewers in, Editing finely paces the whole narrative, John Williams' score is incredibly touching at times, Tom Hanks delivers a performance that's fascinating, funny & delicately balanced and frankly, this film could've done without any love story angle.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Terminal is a sweet, gentle & genuinely affecting tale of American dream, innocence, compassion & love that's enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying in more ways than one. Sure it isn't without its shortcomings & the second half fails to do justice to the film's first hour, the magic spell cast by Spielberg & Hanks together ultimately manages to brush away most complaints. Delightfully recommended."

","In The Terminal, Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) arrives at JFK International Airport only to find out that during the flight from his homeland, a coup over threw the current government spinning the country of Krakhosia into an indefinite war. Upon landing in the Big Apple, the limited English speaking Navorski is shuffled through the intimidating customs network only to be denied entry to the United States; which does not recognize Krakhosian passports in lieu of the political upheaval taking place. Unable to enter America and unable to go back home, Tom Hanks portrays a man stuck in the airport with no country to wait for something to happen in The Terminal. Considering the tight constraints on setting, director Steven Spielberg holds onlookers in their seats waiting for the next laugh in a comedy which at times has an unclear direction on where the plot is going.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks pulls off a convincing accent while playing the innocent immigrant who only has one purpose of being in America which has to do with the peanut can he carries with him. This purpose is discovered by a love interest and flight attendant, Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who otherwise plays a seemingly unnecessary role which ends without closure. Other supporting roles include a group of airport employees, whom one of them finds enjoyment at watching travelers fall on the newly washed concourse floor. Tom Hanks is without a doubt the spearhead of the movie as he pulls off yet another great act while the less familiar supporting actors contribute to the overall success of the film.<br/><br/>The actors were well directed in the roles which they were portraying. Spielberg does a great job of molding what would seem to be a limited script into a movie worth seeing. Who would have thought that a movie taking place solely within an airport could have been as creatively made? However, it cannot be ignored that at times there seemed to be some jumps made throughout the plot.<br/><br/>The majority of the plot consists of the comical interactions of Navorski and the airport employees. At first the employees are skeptical of Navorski however they come to build a strong relationship with the man who lives at Gate 67 after he helps save a fellow immigrant from the grasps of the head of airport security. In addition, there appears to be another storyline between Navorski and Warren which makes it unclear as to which storyline is most important and how they fit together. These dueling story lines at times leaves the viewer confused as to the significance of what just played out in front of them.<br/><br/>Despite the awkward cohesion of story lines, Spielberg saves the at times seemingly terminal film through his direction. The Terminal manages to bring the audience into the concourses of JFK International Airport and provide them with good humor and a heartfelt story through the comical acting of a great cast."

","The Terminal is an endearing romantic comedy with a slavic foreigner, played by Tom Hanks, trapped in an international airport due to an uprising in his fictive home country. That is an unorthodox setup. Add to that an uptight by-the-book security officer unhappy with those complications, and a beautiful female flight attendant, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, trapped in her role of mistress, and you get an idea of what's going to happen.<br/><br/>It's an improbable, but possible, situation that gives rise to a number of comical scenes, very well played by Hanks. He's very believable in his role, showing a lot of work. Nice camera shot, transitions, soundtrack, and editing. Steven Spielberg knows his work. Zeta-Jones is perfect for her role, and is simply beautiful.<br/><br/>The end had a few change in direction, which was appreciable, and even if it got a bit rosy, it was still pretty solid.<br/><br/>On a side note, I thought I recognize our Montreal Mirabel airport, and after checking it out, it turned out to be so.<br/><br/>Good entertainment, see it."

","This was another great movie by 2 of Hollywood's best. Spielberg directing and Tom Hanks acting. Rather then trying to make a ground breaking movie with all the effects and editing he decides to do a simple movie that focuses on storytelling. It is nice to watch a movie where we see a movie that is about the moments between characters and the emotions that are shown and felt. A great piece of film that is able to be funny and entertaining enough to keep you interested. Tom Hanks plays a foreign traveler who becomes stranded in JFK after the country he is from breaks out in civil war and ceases to be a country. Since all this has happened Viktor played my Tom is not allowed to leave the airport. During his predicament he winds up making friends, a love interest and a rival. When he has his new adventure he ends up changing the lives of all those around him. This movies does a great job of being simple without really contributing much instead it becomes about just about the interactions of the different characters. It was interesting how he was able to make some kind of home for himself while he waits his fate. What made this even more incredible was that the airport was built from scratch since for security reasons were not allowed to film in a actual airport. This was a very charming film that leaves a lot for reflection. The looks were very beautiful and elegant it should be a must see for a film-goer."

","Now I actually didn't expect too much from this movie, I basically just got it because I am trying to catch up on my Spielberg movies. I was just hoping for a fun little movie that I could maybe get some good laughs at, but it would be much more than that. That's kind of what happened with Catch Me if You Can, another Spielberg movie starring Tom Hanks. For most of the movie it was pretty much what I expected, but in the last half-hour, it began to exceed my expectations.<br/><br/>What didn't I like? Well basically there isn't much bad in the film, there is just very little that's great. Although I think the film's biggest flaw is the main character, Viktor did get extremely annoying at times. It was frustrating trying to get him to communicate while he was learning English. No offense to foreigners here, but this went beyond a language barrier, this was borderline Mental Retardation. It was almost as if Hanks was playing Forrest Gump again.<br/><br/>As for the things I liked. Well of course the direction is great, as well as the acting. I officially believe that Tom Hanks is the most likable actor ever. The dumbest thing a movie could do is get him to play the villain, because it wouldn't work. ***Warning, the rest of the paragraph contains spoilers.*** But what I loved was when it seemed they were going to go for that Rom-Com third act misunderstanding. Where the woman gets mad at Viktor for not telling him he lived in a Terminal, and it seemed like she was going to leave, and they would spend the rest of the movie moping. But they didn't. After 30 seconds of anger, they talk and she forgives him. That was brilliant! Also the villain really became a complete a**hole in the end before redeeming himself. By the end I had a smile on my face.<br/><br/>The Termianal may not be the best from Spielberg, or Hanks, or even from the two of them together (Saving Private Ryan). But it actually exceeded my expectations, enough to where I would give it a 7.5/10."

How others and Victor played off each other was enjoyable to watch. However, the role played by Catherine Zeta Jones was not exceptional. For her to be in love with a married man when she can easily meet many others during her travels doesn't make sense. If the writers put more thought into her role, she would have had a great character to contrast Victors. As for Tom, some would argue that his Victor shows too much ingenuity while coping with being stuck in the airport terminal, but ask yourself, he somehow manages to go NYC from his Eastern European country and he is a skilled carpenter. I would say he didn't play Victor... he was Victor."

","What an incredibly bad movie. This could be Tom Hanks' worst movie. Everything aspect about the story was contrived. Tom Hanks' performance was contrived.

Literary license can stretch just so far and in this movie it went way beyond what the rubber band can bear. Every character in this movie was uninteresting, most uninteresting being the drub played by Tom Hanks. His character has to be one of the dumbest Hollywood contrivances in cinematic history. The character is part stupid, part clueless, part hapless and completely unlikable. This movie should have been over the moment his application for a visa was denied. That itself would have been a red flag for airport personnel. That Tom Hanks' gives a sloppy performance can be forgiven. After all, he was working with substandard material. But that a production company actually felt this was a movie worth making is sad. People get stuck at airports all the time; it's one of the drawbacks of traveling. Planes are late, delays occur, bad weather, unanticipated events, but NO ONE ever actually lives in an airport, no matter how egregious the situation, except a man named Victor in a movie called The Terminal."

","The back story - if you like - of ""The Terminal"" is rather less celebrated than the ""Man without a country"" type plot that has been well - covered by writers on this site. Back in 1958,""Esquire"" magazine commissioned Art Kane to take photographs for a special Jazz edition.It was his idea to get together all the top jazz musicians who were in New York on the actual day of the photograph and picture them outside a Harlem Brownstone. The resultant portrait became one of the most iconic of all jazz photos and was the subject - 30 years later - of a TV programme known as ""A Great Day in Harlem"". Victor Navorski (Mr T.Hanks) had flown to New York To complete his late father's collection of autographs from all the musicians shown in Kane's photograph.That collection was in the tin of peanuts he guarded so fiercely. Saxophonist/composer/educator Mr Benny Golson was leading a quartet at a New York hotel.His was the last signature Victor needed. JFK's crystal - like appearance resembles Superman's Fortress of Solitude as our hero refines his game plan,righting wrongs,uniting star - crossed lovers and jumping over tall buildings in his spare time. Despite the worst efforts of the Lex Luthor - like Mr S.Tucci,Victor is able to escape from his glass prison and meet Mr Golson. He then returns to Krypton where no doubt everyone is as compassionate,honest,multi - talented,decent and forgiving as he. Mr Hanks is really very good in this movie.Not,as some have suggested,patronising or even racist.

The terminal is a microcosm of life, the routine and the monotonous part of it that we can't seem to escape from. Hanks accomplishes the feat and goes beyond, playing the English challenged Victor Naborsky as he arrives in New York in order to keep a promise he made to his dying father. He is not bitter.

"EqbalAnwari","8","0","1","29 July 2010"," The Terminal is more than just a joyfully juvenile comedy romance
","It starts at JFK International Airport where upon his arrival, Viktor Novorski (Tom Hanks) learns that a coup has taken place in his home country Krakozhia (a fictional state name believed to be located in the Eastern Europe.) Viktor has very limited knowledge of the English language. He is barely able to answer airport's officials' repetitively bureaucratic questions.<br/><br/>After he is stranded in the lounge, he struggles hard for his right to enter the US. But no body (airport staff/passengers) not only help him understand the news translation on TV, but also DO NOT facilitate the immigration process with his paper work.<br/><br/>Amelia (Katherine Zeta Jones) plays her part as a flight hostess brilliantly. In parts you think she's made for the profession. Viktor and Amelia have a unique chemistry in this movie. The dialogue throughout the movie is very soothing no matter it's among Gupta and his co-workers accusing Viktor for being a spy or between Viktor and Enrique who wishes to win the heart of officer Dolores with the help of no other one but Viktor and or leading casts' history chat- specifically on Napoleon Bonaparte's genius and gallantry.<br/><br/>The story is so well written. Viktor's adventure is to fulfill a promise and soon it turns into a survival story. In a scene, he goes from one store to another to make a living (three times meal.) At one shop, he's asked for contact details that much to everyone's surprise, he gives the nearby public telephone number and waits there for a phone call all day long and when finally the phone rings ""what are you going to do now?"" asks the owner of the shop rejecting him. ""I'm go to the bathroom"" Viktor replies.<br/><br/>Clearly, this project is inferior to Spielberg's previous works such as Schindler List or Saving Private Ryan but needless to say, once again, he's paying attention to our deepest emotions as well. Imagine when it's peace again in Viktor's country, how hard he fights to fulfill his father's wish and then return to his home. It unfolds the curtains in front of the viewers' eyes and helps them to vividly see the twenty first century bureaucracy most governments adhere- the borderline mankind draws on their respective territories. It shows - the more - than - necessary formality of governments' departments which reminds us of Leo Tolstoy quote ""Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us."" It's about how Viktor copes with the unsettling conditions created by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who is the head of the airport and monitors the monitor room occasionally. Frank gradually becomes jealous or better said worried of Viktor because his inner self sees Viktor's popularity and patience larger than it actually is. It's as if he fosters a depravity inside himself the kind that John Claggart did in Herman Melville's famous novel Billy Budd. Claggart too was jealous of Billy's youth, strength and natural charisma. <br/><br/>In concluding this commentary, the terminal is simple in the meantime a serious comedy that goes beyond the boundaries of the locations it's been filmed and repeats to thousands (well, HUNDREDS if thousands sound exaggeration) Viktors daily, weekly and monthly Viktors who are living in the third world countries and are being officially invited to wedding parties in countries rather their own- to a Western Country. Viktors who wish to fly to fulfill promises. Viktors who dream to embark on spiritual journeys, to make pilgrimage to the tombs of all those autonomous spirits- those literati and illuminati since middle ages instead faces severe tortures of bureaucracy since aviation facility or visa endorsement.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to those with mildly humanitarian sensibility"

","It is particularly interesting to see how Hanks can make a nice movie out of nothing. The concept of someone arriving to New York and having to stay at the airport, is not likely to produce any funny situations, but surprisingly in this movie it does. I can't figure out if it is because of the amazing qualities of Hanks, or the creation of sufficiently interesting encounters. In the end, I think, there are just a few actors and actresses out there who can be placed in any situation, setting or plot and succeed in making a great movie out of it. Hanks definitely is one of those. The role played by Zeta-Jones on the other hand doesn't remains pretty empty and little appealing. She doesn't succeed in adequately supporting Hank's part. After all a nice and entertaining movie, but not worth an Oscar either."

","Like in all the other films he's in, Tom Hanks puts a lot of effort into his character. Once again, he proves to be one of Hollywood's most talented actors. I will admit though that his Russian accent was a little ridiculous. The supporting cast also adds diligence to their characters. I feel though that the other great talent came from Stanley Tucci (the potato chip scene he delivers is so darn hilarious) as the security manager. My only complaint though is that the movie seemed to drag a lot, but it did keep my interest. The atmosphere in the movie also is rather syrupy and silly, I mean, the idea of keeping a foreigner stuck in an airport over an incident in his country? Sounds a little far-fetched to me.

","Tom Hanks shines in this heartwarming, eye-opening film about the man who has fallen into the only crack in the U.S. customs department. Unable to return to a war-stricken Krakozhia and unable to enter the U.S. he is stuck in a never-ending no-man's land; a place where he doesn't feel welcome, doesn't feel wanted, and does not belong. A place he calls home, but we call the Terminal. This 2004 film, directed by Stephen Spielberg, stars Tom Hanks in the lead role as a Krakozhian immigrant grounded to the JFK airport, who has to learn to adapt to American culture without stepping foot on its soil. Tom Hanks accurately portrays a non-American traveler, and successfully places himself in the shoes of a lost immigrant. His lovable persona and barely understandable accent captivates the audience and has them willing to follow him to Krakozhia and back by the end of the film. His character befriends a motley crew of janitorial workers, and even catches the eye of a flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Together with his newfound friends, he discovers what it truly means to be an American and realizes that the home he had been searching for was just through the doors of gate 67. Viktor Navorski, played by Tom Hanks, isn't your average traveler. He can't speak, can't read, and can hardly navigate his way around a crowded airport food court. He shaves in the restrooms, parades around in a bathrobe, and feasts on saltine crackers doused in condiments. He is alone in a foreign country, hated by authority, and not trusted by the staff. The majority is indifferent towards him, ignoring his cries of anguish over confusion from the news, and not stopping to help him use the phone despite his pleas. He is unwanted, unwelcome, and unacceptable, but he is also ambitious. And through that ambition he finds friendship, happiness, and a little love on the side. Expert film critics Ryan ""the Rain Maker"" Rodela, and Justin ""Horse-whispering"" Holland each gave the movie two thumbs up along with a 4.5 star rating out of a possible 5. So whether you're waiting for a flight, or just sitting at home with nothing to do, the Terminal promises to take off, entertain, and land you with the perfect family film."
"mr_popcorn","8","0","1","26 August 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""The Terminal""
","While Viktor Navorski is en route to the U.S. to fulfill a wish of his late father's, there is a coup in the Eastern European country in which he lives. When he lands at JFK, he learns that his country is no longer recognized by the U.S. so he cannot enter - and he can't go home either, because all planes to his country are canceled. While waiting in this limbo, Viktor takes up residence in JFK Terminal and learns another definition of home.<br/><br/>Okay first off, this is not Spielberg's worst film ever as some people might tell you. I think ""War of the Worlds"" is his worst or even the newly-released ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". Admittedly it is not his best film ever. 'The Terminal' is a film in-between if we're talking about Steven Spielberg's film slate. The dialogue and the script wasn't that bad and I wouldn't consider Tom Hanks' accent as rubbish. The story will hook you from the minute it starts up until the end. Spielberg and crew has managed to balance a fine line between the dramatic parts and the comedic timing without one overlapping the other. Tom Hanks' portrayal as the man from the fictional country Krakozhia was effective in my opinion. His likability as an actor was effortlessly transitioned in his Navorski character.<br/><br/>'The Terminal' is an 8."

Viktor cannot go back to Krakozhia but also he cannot enter America. He forces to stay this airport until the war calms down. He starts to stay all day (including night) in the airport which is very close to America, but very remote place at the same time. <br/><br/>Few months later, the news inform that the war of Krakozhia is over. He expects to enter America, but he is not allowed. He can go back to his homeland, but he is not intend to do. He is saying ""I have a promise why I am staying here."" <br/><br/>What is the promise?

"amateur100","Null","0","1","28 May 2008"," A film that doesn't ask for praise.
","It seems that many of the films I've seen in my lifetime beg to be thought of as a ""great film."" They want the Oscars, so they go controversial, take radical cinematography approaches (which end up giving headaches and confusion), and have other overly-bold characteristics that take away from the true purpose of a dramatic film- to send a message that moves the audience. Maybe that message may be disturbing (like in ""Requium for a Dream"") or maybe it's insightful (""Into the Wild""), but it must have something that will stick with the movie- watcher for days, and have them question ideals, conformities, or whatever it may be.<br/><br/>That being said, The Terminal is one of the best dramatic films I have ever seen. Not because of Tom Hanks' incredible performance, and not because of the lighting or the shooting sequences. The reason why I loved this film so much was because of its many messages, a major one being that one can still have age-old integrity and honesty in a world where it may serve you better in the short-term to make an invirtuous decision.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' character, Viktor Navorski, is an intercepted voyager from the fictitious country Crocasia that is intercepted at an American airport's terminal because of his country's civil war, which forces the American government to label him as having no current citizenship. Throughout his long stay in the terminal, during which he fashions meals out of free snacks, learns the English language (okay, a little far-fetched, but it had to be done), and makes numerous friends simply on the basis of his honesty and trustworthiness. I'm not going to go too much into the plot, but I can say that it is NOT a Romance. Some descriptions of the film may give that suggestion, but the plot centers around friendship, not relationship.<br/><br/>Viktor's constant acts of kindness to those who don't plan to give him anything in return (for instance when he hilariously offers a gigantic fake fish to the airport manager that is keeping him locked in the terminal), and his simplicity in morals personally moved me to a point of realization. We all know what the right and wrong things to do are. Even if we may habitually do the wrong things, we do know they are pervasive. Steven Spielberg shows in this film that living a good life does not take the genius of a philosopher or the experience of a priest, but merely making every decision the way we know is the right way. This film doesn't ask to be held up for acclaim; it just asks to be watched and learned from."

"WonKaiKo","7","0","1","27 April 2008"," An enjoyable film but a lost opportunity.
","The one thing that struck me as truly bizarre about this entire film was the fact that DreamWorks never actually used the original story details that they (reportedly) shelled out around $250,000 for. As the old adage goes, ""true life is stranger than fiction"", and in the case of Mr. Merhan Karimi Nasseri, the (former) Iranian citizen who is the unsung hero of the real-life story which inspired this work, that is absolutely the case. The most important part of any film is establishing credibility in the opening segment but the reworking of real-life events that the scriptwriters gave to this film was just not credible. This is a great, great pity as it is a truly remarkable sounding story about immigration bureaucracy and mistakes, stolen credentials, a human-rights court struggle, and a 16-year confinement to the international transit lounge of Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport.<br/><br/>It's every film maker's prerogative to instil whatever political or emotional overtones that they see fit into their work. And Spielberg definitely left his overtones all over this film, from the grossly overdone syrupy schmaltz in some areas to the ""politically correct"" and fantasy-style portrayal of immigration at United States airports regarding detainees. I myself have been harassed, strip-searched, and the contents of my baggage overturned by United States immigration on numerous occasions just due to the colour of my skin and the fact my name looks ""indian"". So the portrayal that US immigration finally has ""compassion for the human plight"" was nigh-on insulting in the light of my own experiences.<br/><br/>However, contrary to other reviews posted, I still believe that Spielberg spent a great deal of effort on the visual and audio realism that is the reason for his well-earned reputation. I also believe he had to make some very serious judgements about how to interpret events in a real-life story and about whether those events should even be portrayed in the film in the first place. The facts show that Mr. Nasseri indulged in political activity against his own country within the confines of the United Kingdom, and that the British Government later (unrelatedly) denied his application for citizenship based on his claims of British ancestry. So, given the potentially hazardous material there was to work with, I think Spielberg did a good job in finding the likable aspects of a character that could have easily been unfavourably viewed by audiences. He also did a very reasonable job in emphasising the fact that life has a little humour even in the darkest of situations, and it is this for me that made the film quite enjoyable overall. As for the actors, Tom Hanks's attention to detail in language and character was excellent (care of a Bulgarian dialect coach), though a little cheesy in places. And the other performances, particularly Stanley Tucci and Barry Shabaka Henley, were good given the script they had to work with.<br/><br/>Of course, the one problem you have with dramatising any truly bizarre real-life story is that you have to bring it within the credible reaches of your target audience if they are to make the leap of faith on their part to connect with it. This is Spielberg's forte and in this film he created a work that was enjoyable and believable for cosy, suburban households without the entire concept being lost on them. However, having purchased the rights to a story about a living person, you have to wonder what drives a director to literally ignore real-life facts in favour of an almost completely unbelievable plot rewrite. In doing so, he squandered an opportunity to make a legendary film while, at the same time, trivialising the events that mentally all-but destroyed a man confined to a terminal building due to an unfortunate incident at a railway station followed by 16 years of bureaucratic red tape.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this film as enjoyable viewing? Yes. Then I would recommend going to a news website and actually reading the real story. At the time of writing, The Guardian newspaper (UK) article ""The man who lost his past"" has a one year feature documentary about Mr. Nasseri. I guarantee you'll find the real-life version a lot more fascinating."

It's loosely based on a true story, but the plot seems especially implausible in this day and age. You can tell it's going to take a mountain of sentimental handholding to overcome this bureaucratic mess.<br/><br/>Every movie is allowed to exploit a few moments of disbelief or coincidence, but the Terminal features an endless chain of unlikely occurrences.

Mostly you'll question the irrational behavior of the characters.

Amelia several times mentions how bizarre she is behaving whenever she spontaneously asks Viktor out for lunch having just met him. But merely acknowledging a plot hole does not patch the hole, and the movie plods on inexplicably.<br/><br/>*Spoilers ahead* I had to step away from the television for about 15 minutes. As I was leaving, Victor had conversed with Amelia two or three times, and he was helping an airport food worker and an immigration officer become acquainted by relaying messages back and forth though the two hadn't actually met. When I got back, Victor and Amelia were apparently dating in his airport apartment, and the two airport workers were getting engaged (and then married 20 seconds later). That was some 15 minutes!<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci's character is reduced to a sputtering megalomaniac of Disney super-villain proportions, evilly obsessed with the destruction of Victor. I could almost see him shaking his fist whiling cursing those meddling kids.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie pretends to offer a profound statement about persistence, friendship, loyalty and humanity.

","Viktor Navorski is a traveller from the obscure country of Krakozhia who arrives at JFK airport just as his homeland suffers a military coup and the US cuts all ties. Under law his passport is confiscated and he must stay in the airport building or risk arrest as an illegal immigrant. Viktor decides he will obey the rules and remain inside the terminal, but is determined to make the most of his enforced prisoner status.<br/><br/>This is a typically brilliant, good-natured, engrossing character study by Spielberg, in his most playful Capra-esquire mood. Like Empire Of The Sun or Always, it takes a man in an extreme oddball situation who takes it on the chin and uses his resourcefulness, humour and compassion to help himself and others. Hanks is wonderful as Navorski, starting off as a bewildered schmoe who doesn't understand any English, panics at the news footage of his country's predicament, starts to adapt to his situation and make friends with some of the more lowly airport staff, and ultimately becomes a sort of minor rebel hero. He is well matched by Tucci as Dixon, the stickler-for-the-rules security manager who simply wants Navorksi to go away and be someone else's problem but won't consider lifting a finger to help him, and the supporting cast are a great collection of oddballs, particularly McBride, Pallana and Saldana. As ever, Spielberg's style is both delightful and effortless, aided by his regular cameraman Janusz Kaminski's dynamic, flowing photography, which glides round the airport's hectic daytime scenes and is quietly intense as Navorski spends his evenings sleeping in an unfinished corridor. The movie's big theme is that everyone is waiting for something - the only difference with Viktor is that it's more obvious, and the comparisons with Dixon are subtle and charming. There were some things I didn't like - the Zeta-Jones character is a bit boring and goes nowhere, the product placement is off-putting and the McGuffin with Navorski's tin of beans is perhaps a bit too typically sweet Spielberg fluff. These moments hardly matter though in such a fine character piece, with some terrific performances and an inspiring timeless direction. Extremely well written by Sacha Gervasi (The Big Tease), Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can) and Andrew Niccol (Gattaca), with an incredibly impressive main set by Alex McDowell built in an aircraft hanger in a small regional airport in California. This is a feelgood movie for sure, but an extremely well made one by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time."

"asenkron","7","0","1","24 September 2007"," The Terminal gives us important lessons about loyalty to a promise.
","The Terminal's theme is an extraordinary wherever you look at it. The JFK airport does landlordness to a unusual visitor who run after a special target. According to the story, an Asian man who is Viktor Navorski, wants to realize a promise that he gave to the father. The promise which Navorski works to realize is a deficient sign that wasn't only written a Jazz Legend Benny Golson who shares the same photo with Navorski's father like other Jazz masters. Upon his father will, Navorski must complete all the signs of people who take part in a special photo. Only Golson must be completed by him, but Golson lives in USA and Navorski goes a long trip. As a coquetry of faith, while he passes JFK's border, the government in his country is removed by rebellious people and his country is removed also from the list that USA accepts. In this condition Navorski happens stateless and JFK foreigners department seize the Navorski's position. Navorski starts to live in JFK as forming a living area with the hope of USA's accepting his country as a country. He waits for a long time and acquires good relationships with airport staff. Then the time turns and he reaches his purpose.<br/><br/>I think there is a light similarity between Castaway and this film by the direction of survival effort.<br/><br/>This amazing story got me amazed. Almost the whole story take place in an airport. Hanks' innocent behaviours fit in with his role like ""I am an Englishman in New York"". I didn't find so effective the performance of director. The time of it is too long as two hours.<br/><br/>In spite of some long and boring scenes, The Terminal is worthy to watch. Because Viktor Navorski doesn't terminate his hopes about his target."

","Viktor Navorski is on his way into New York City when he is told that his country has been annexed from the inside- It no longer technically exists. It seems that this has placed him in a ""crack"" in the system- There is nothing that Head of Airport Security Frank Dixon can do but let him live in the airport terminal- So that is what Viktor Navorski does: He lives.<br/><br/>The story here is truly the star of the show. Through his foreign eyes Viktor allows us to see the irony of our rushed and ridiculous American lives. He also changes the lives of just about everyone he meets. As Viktor himself discovers, everyone is waiting for something; everyone has something they're yearning for in their life. Yet it is those of us who stop waiting and just soar who truly are happy.<br/><br/>And much thanks for that has to be given to the amazingly talented cast. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Viktor; You know it's a great performance when you completely forget about the actor and just see the character. Catherine Zeta-Jones is spot-on as a truly selfish and love-desperate woman who has realized what love really is for the first time. Stanley Tucci is excellent once again. However, it is Kumar Pallana as the janitor who reluctantly befriends Viktor who stole the show for me. Really, there's not a bad performance in the film.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's legendary directing is superb, and we feel like we truly know the character's and have lived this amazing story right alongside them. The cinematography is lovely and cleverly sets up the humor of the scenes.<br/><br/>The Terminal is definitely one of the best movie's of it's year. The humor is fun throughout, the performances are all wonderful, and the story and message are unforgettable. So, what are you waiting for? Stop waiting and soar. Truly a wonderful film! 7/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"
"karthik-globalsoul","7","0","1","26 July 2007"," THE TERMINAL  received message, loud and clear!
","(Karthik Narayan) The word ""Terminal"" means a couple of things - terminal meaning an airport terminus or a station, and also meaning communication system  And all are powerfully and intellectually captured in this movie; A rather intriguing, pressing film about a guy who gets into nowhere, a position that he didn't get into, but owing to circumstances beyond his control, has to live in an airport terminal for God-knows-for-how-long! Based on a real life story, the movie shows how language can become a barrier and also how it can be overcome once you have the right attitude. Survival instincts of a man trapped in no-man's land are so sharply showcased in this motion picture.<br/><br/>A beautiful picture painted of the adage  where there is a will, there is a way out, and there certainly was a ""way out"" for our hero Victor (talk about the perfect name for your hero- victor indeed)! The movie keeps you guessing; the elements of suspense, thrilling moments that one would associate with Steven Spielberg (the director) are there.<br/><br/>The fictional country of Krakozhia is well represented by Tom Hanks and he delivers the Bulgarian language smoothly; not that most of us know Bulgarian, but it is hard for an English speaker to pretend he doesn't understand English  so in that context its great acting.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks looks young and handsome, and interestingly even though this movie came in 2004, he looks younger than in 2002 (""Catch me if you can""). And after Castaway, most of his movies seem to portray him getting into all sorts of problems and his coming out of them.<br/><br/>Catherine Zeta Jones is a confused American woman who can't choose for herself. She and Hanks has something going, or so it seems, but we gather that in the end, she can't make up her mind at all. Now, I am not for male chauvinism, but her role had major flaws in it. However, she does excite us all with her appearances now and then.<br/><br/>The end was rather surprising  shocking may be the right word, with all the interest and chemistry generated by the lead woman (Catherine Zeta Jones), as Shakespeare would have aptly named it, much ado about nothing. Or a blown experiment, even. But that's the story, to like it or not like it  that's left to you.<br/><br/>Rating  7.5/10 (for its suspense mainly)."
"Ryu_Darkwood","6","0","2","28 June 2007"," Silly movie, despite its good intentions
","Despite that this movie has a heartwarming undertone, my cynical side just can't cope with this ultra-sweet film that tries to deliver a true message on a wrong way.<br/><br/>The protagonist, a refugee being stuck on an airport due to inhumane bureaucracy, is a totally clichéd version of a real immigrant. He doesn't have anything in common with anyone really wanting to build up a life in the United States. And that's my biggest problem with this movie, the total lack of any realism in the main character played by Tom Hanks. At the end we see his true reason to go to the U.S.A. and believe me if I say that it's an anti-climax of epic proportions to see the silly reason of why this guy has to endure all this pain to set foot on American soil. Add up the completely senseless love-story around Catharina Zeta-Jones, as always being too artificial with her stunning beauty but failure to act natural, and you get a very silly movie.<br/><br/>But like I said in my introduction, it has an important message to give to its audience. I also believe that immigrants build up America, and the rest of the western world for that matter, and that they should be cherished for their efforts instead of despised as happens too often. In Holland we recently had a political wave that tried to tune down Immigracy. It created a lot of sad stories of people that build up a living in our country but had to leave due to inhumane bureaucrats. This being said, I must add that positive stories about immigrants are important to tell. Spielberg had a good point by making this movie, but he should have made it more conform the truth..."

","Tom Hanks seems to be good at the ""stuck"" role. First he was stuck on an island in ""Castaway"", now he is stuck in an airport in ""The Terminal"". He plays Viktor Navorski and he is in America from his Eastern European home, but since there is turmoil in his land, he can't get permission to step foot onto American soil.<br/><br/>In a movie such as this one, you are greatly relying on the actor to carry it. This is a movie with no action, no real romance, no special effects, and no scene changes. Tom Hanks does an excellent job as the broken English speaking European. There are a few engaging incidents throughout the movie while the main story prods along: that being Viktor trying to get permission to walk outside the airport. There are a few other interesting characters, and there is even a bit of anticipation as you hold on to find out exactly why Viktor is in America. I liked the movie. I thought Tom was wonderful and I thought the character combination was choice."

","""The Terminal"" is the kind of film a director can make only when he owns the studio. A small-scale single-person story about waiting in an airport featuring big stars on a giant set, it is neither the best nor worst film Steven Spielberg ever made, but interesting despite its flaws.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a citizen of the fictional central European republic of Krakhosia who finds himself stuck at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City when a civil war breaks out back home, effectively stranding him at the airport itself. There he makes do as best he can.<br/><br/>""You have no legal right to enter the United States, and I have no legal right to detain you,"" explains the head of JFK's security force (Stanley Tucci). ""It seems you have fallen through a small crack in the system.""<br/><br/>Tucci plays the film's heavy, one of several key elements of the film that doesn't really work. Yet this is not a bad Spielberg film like ""1941"" or ""The Lost World."" ""The Terminal"" at its best showcases Hanks' engagingly odd Latka-esquire character and Spielberg's bold attempt at melding French New Wave to Bill Forsyth at his early-80s whimsical peak. Even when the film veers into a logic-defying romance subplot between Hanks and an adulterous flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, it never entirely loses you, and there are nice moments throughout that show why, even when operating at less than full steam, Spielberg is the greatest filmmaker of his kind since Frank Capra. He excels at pushing buttons his audience doesn't even know are there.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie in a theater with a woman from Russia, who found the film much funnier than I did. An immigrant herself, I think she responded to Navorski as a doughty representative of the immigrant spirit of American culture though no immigrant himself (he plans to return to Krakhosia eventually.) As Navorski sets to work carving a life in the airport terminal, he wins support from a veritable melting pot of ethnic and racial types who find common cause in his welfare.<br/><br/>There are some virtuoso moments from Spielberg, like a long crane shot that pulls to reveal Navorski as the small cog he is at JFK, but for the most part he keeps things simple. The script overplays its hand throughout, however. Navorski isn't just well-regarded by the airport workers; they stick photocopies of his handprint at their work stations and follow him like the Pied Piper as he walks to the front gate. Tucci's Frank Dixon comes unglued as he is lectured by a superior about learning from Navorski. The romance with the flight attendant drowns under a sea of artificial dialogue.<br/><br/>The ending is rather weak, too. Though it references a cool bit of real cultural history, discovering the reason behind Navorski's visit doesn't really pay off for the story.<br/><br/>Yet I'm a sucker for any film set in New York that references Tony Randall, Yeoman Rand, and ""Strangers In The Night,"" and finds the value and comedy of life even when stuck in an airport. ""The Terminal"" doesn't hold your attention like classic Spielberg, but it does reward it now and then."

It becomes illegal for him to either enter our country or return to his own.

I don't think the film did a good enough job of suspending my disbelief because it took forever for me to get into the film and I wasn't trying to resist. A lot of story lines weren't very well kept together and most of the characters were a little hard to believe. So the writing wasn't very strong. On the other hand, the direction and the acting by Hanks was pretty strong (Hanks gets better the more he gets to speak English). I think it kept the film from becoming a waste of time.

","Thanks for coach Phil Jackson to recommend this enlightening book from mr Pirsig ""Zen & the art of motorcycle maintenance"", whom ideas are brilliantly illustrated in that movie.<br/><br/>First, it's about being stuck in life due to own value rigidity: Victor Navorsky can be seen in this way. As long as he wishes to enter America as an acceptable traveller, showing honesty to administration & compassion for his fellows, he is stuck in the airport terminal. The word ""terminal"" as ""end of everything"" is funny in that interpretation.<br/><br/>It is also interesting that the character played by Tucci is also very rigid, and his fundamental keys are clearly explained: his passion is ""rules"" and Navorsky would be ""stuck"" in the terminal as long as he. <br/><br/>The escape from this stuckness can be more flexibility, in fact doing ""what is good"". As Victor recognizes that the ultimate goal of his trip is the memory of his father, then his value evolves, and he can be free from his stuckness: He goes to New-York by breaking the law & leaving his friends in difficult situations.<br/><br/>Second, Zen is an instant-to-instant practice: the scope is what you see in each moment & you have to deal with that to be happy. In this attitude, Victor excels: he uses every bit, every space of the terminal, and by doing this, he gains a lot of friends. <br/><br/>In the opposite, pain is only the experience of not letting go what is lost. His last gaze to Amelia is a perfect reaction: he knows the relationship is sadly dead & accepts it: He gave to Amelia all his best but that wasn't enough for her. He understands that it is useless to add anything else, so he just stares at her.<br/><br/>For all those reasons, movies are very helpful to offer advices, wisdom & reflexion to people who must face difficulties but without any family or friends presence. And Spielberg is one of the best filmmaker: his camera is alive (like the spy one at the terminal.. bzzz.. bzzzz) and he always assemble a great team: Tom Hanks (great in dubbing eastern accent & being open-minded), great theme from John Williams, all the world-wide casting & and extraordinary ordinary set of an airport terminal.<br/><br/>A movie similar in spirit to ""Groundhog Day"" and as enjoyable A recommendation."

","If anyone still doubted Tom Hanks talent, ""The Terminal"" came to prove Hanks is one of the best actors ever! After masterpieces like ""Apollo 13"", ""Philadelphia"", ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast Away"" he comes up with another excellent performance. This time he is great as a man whose a fictitious country is in a kind of war (or something like it) which keeps him from coming back home and stepping out of JFK airport. Once he doesn't speak English he cannot communicate with others, and his creativity is the only instrument he has to make people understand him. With very good facial expressions and body language, Hanks makes Navorsky, his character, get our full time attention. If the film is centralized in Hanks, I tell you: this is fair!"

First off, why would Amelia (Zeta-Jones) convince Frank (Tucci) that despite the fact that she can get any man to fall in love with her, she would pick a practically illiterate man, Viktor (Hanks) to be with, only to leave him for another guy? Secondly, how could the scriptwriters not have Viktor and Amelia end up together?! The whole story seemed to build up to their becoming a couple, only to leave you with a broken-hearted Viktor, and a seemingly happy Amelia (Although, I think she'd rather be with Viktor than her married boyfriend)as the parting. <br/><br/>It was a great movie up until the last few minutes.

","I've never really given much thought to what goes on at an airport, beyond the fact that you just wait until your flight arrives and then get the hell out of there. But The Terminal, directed by Steven Spielberg, paints an interesting picture, and crafts a compelling story out of the exploits of one immigrant who finds that an airport has become his home away from home.<br/><br/>Apparently based on a true story, The Terminal reunites Spielberg with Tom Hanks for the third time. Hanks plays foreigner Viktor Navorski, who has come to New York's JFK airport from the fictional country Krakosia. But while in transit, Viktor finds himself the victim of a bizarre twist of bureaucratic fate.<br/><br/>War has broken out in Krakosia, and Viktor's VISA has just expired. That means he can't go home, and since Krakosia is a country not recognised by the USA, Viktor cannot leave the airport. Now trapped between two worlds, Viktor begins the slow process of turning JFK airport into his home.<br/><br/>There is something inherently fascinating to this film, which is what drew me to it. Is it possible to make a life for yourself within the confines of an airport terminal? Tom Hanks explored this territory before in Cast Away, where he had to make a life for himself on a desert island. Hanks admirably rises to the challenge here with relish, where JFK has become his own personal stomping grounds.<br/><br/>The Terminal is quite logical in the way it explores Viktor's predicament. He speaks hardly any English, and manages to pick it up gradually from the televisions and travelogue books from the airport's various shops.<br/><br/>He pays for food from finding loose change in pay phones and trolley carts, and eventually gets work on a construction crew. Viktor slowly becomes almost like a permanent addition to the staff, and an expected sight. He starts to make friends with the personnel at the airport, who become almost like an extended family to Viktor.<br/><br/>He plays matchmaker between a janitor and a clerk, diffuses a potentially dangerous situation with a confused foreigner, and ultimately, falls in love himself. Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an air hostess who comes and goes through the airport from time to time. Although she is unaware of Viktor's unique situation, they strike up an unlikely romance.<br/><br/>The Terminal is at it's most effective during the first half of the film, as Viktor gets to know his new home. And I love the little details. Co-written by Andrew Niccols of The Truman Show, there are times where it has some of that film's brilliance. There are some fantastic subtle gags such as the cameras watching Viktor, and looking the other way when he gets suspicious. The eyes of the airport are on him always, trying to frustrate his every move, and like Truman, it is always gratifying watching Viktor come out on top.<br/><br/>Hanks brings some of the innocent charm that made Big so entertaining to this role, and it's always interesting to watch him strike up friendships with airline personnel. I suppose because it's difficult to imagine them as people with lives, rather than just faceless drones behind a counter.<br/><br/>One thing that makes The Terminal worth the price of admission is the sheer amount of time and effort that has gone into recreating an actual airport terminal. It was converted from a disused hangar, and includes over 2000 extras. It is so huge and multilayered that it's a marvel to behold. The sheer amount of shops and restaurants could be interpreted as product placement, but I suppose that's unavoidable, and as I said, the film makes the attempt to flesh out the people who work in those places.<br/><br/>Inevitably for a Spielberg film, things eventually come to an uplifting ending in the vein of Frank Capra. But by that time, Hanks has won us over with his bumbling goofiness that we can't help rooting for him. Also Stanley Tucci makes an impression as the head of operations, who is always trying to find ways to get Viktor out of his airport. It's a good role because he treads a fine line between a complete villain, and a hassled bureaucrat who is in much of a bind as poor Viktor.<br/><br/>If the ending has a fault, it's Viktor's motivations for coming to America in the first place. The payoff is a little unsatisfying, and his romance with Amelia just peters out without even an explanation. But despite these minor flaws, there is still much to savour here. Although not a perfect film, there are times where it manages to create feelings of dislocation, pleasantly reminiscent of Lost in Translation.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic performance (as well as accent) from Hanks, some fine ensemble playing, and one of the most truly extraordinary set-pieces in recent memory make The Terminal an amiable and sweet tale of a man without a country."
"airscrew","10","0","1","19 February 2006"," The Terminal
","First, I want to apologize for my bad English. So don't criticize me or disturb yourself by my English. I thank you very much. The reason that I write this comment, although my English isn't perfect, is the fact that ""The Terminal"" is really one of the best movies that there is.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the Terminal, when Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) got picked up by the security. The reason is the fact that his country, Krakozhia, is in the progress of a revolution. This makes the passport of Viktor invalid. Not knowing what is happening, he says many times ""I go New York"". With some funny scenes he gets to know what is happening. After this there comes a long time of living in the airport.<br/><br/>The director of the airport wants that he'll get out of this airport, but he can't do this without that Viktor makes a foul. Viktor does a lot of things in the airport, and makes himself home. After some times he makes friends, the progress in making these friend were always funny, but also dramatic, as one of the audience I felt very combined to him. He gets to know a woman, Amelia Jane Warren (Catherina Zeta-Jones) They become friends and maybe even.. With Amelia in the story, the story gets the factor love. Combined with the funny and dramatic part, it makes the story almost perfect. I must praise the scriptwriter; it really is a piece of masterwork.<br/><br/>The actors, with Tom Hanks, Catherina Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci played really good in the movie. There wasn't any kind of hesitation or sign of unreality. I must praise even more about the actor skills of Tom Hanks, although he knows the English language better than me, he was able to make me believe that my skills in English were far more better than his. This is really astonishing.<br/><br/>The music in the story also was very good and fitted very best in the movie. I can't have complaints about that.<br/><br/>The ending of the story is..how should I say it..""perfect with some hesitations"". The first thing with the ending is that you'll see what kind of genius the scriptwriter is. It has a lot of symbolic thing, what makes watching the movie twice very attractive. The second thing is a personal thing..you'll collide it.<br/><br/>In the end I want to tell you something about the making of the scenes, the audience will get the feeling that he is right now in the screen, in the airport. This is a really good achievement, for the director, Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>With the really perfect script (if there was an even stronger praise word I would use that) very skill full actors and good scenes. I give this movie a nine. I must warn you that, if you don't like comedy, love and drama, you must not watch this movie. But if you like one of these factors, I recommend you this movie. If you like two of these factors you must see it! And if you like all three of them..you'll have the time of your live, on my word.<br/><br/>Cario Dally"

","Very neat pseudo tear jerker playing on all the moving human emotion yet not losing the essential light magic touch of comedy.<br/><br/>The movie was well put together, at least from my perspective, and is a clear indication of what a great Mr Spielberg can do when directing humans and not machines(War of the Worlds).<br/><br/>Furthermore, it just goes to show class will always win through, no sex, no violence, no swearing, and no eardrum shattering horrible music that ruins so many films these days.<br/><br/>In many ways reminiscent of the classic lightweights of the 1940s. I liked it and would recommend it as good family viewing.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is always a winner for me and he really settle into this part admirably, his accent, which is a difficult one to imitate was brilliant and Catherine Zeta Jones is just so darned beautiful!

"Quinoa1984","7","0","2","14 January 2006"," a good piece of humanist comedy, nothing more, nothing less
","The Terminal is sort of like a a Frank Capra tale spun into 21st century America, with it a sort of divide between the naive innocence of ordinary men, and the cynicism of the outside world. It also is akin to E.T. as being about an outsider who comes into a strange situation, gets befriended, but in reality is really all on his own on his quest. There is a sweetness to the film that works well, even when all plausibility at times goes right out the window in return to try and make shamelessly entertaining product. Steven Spielberg here has a film that is meant, in a way, as THE film for airline movies, as it can be geared for kids and adults, though like airplanes its not always the best experience.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is genuine for a lot of the performance, and at least a little fascinating, as Viktor Navorski, a refugee from a country made up for the sake of the film (though, apparently, his accent is for real). He's stuck in the airport, not able to leave into New York City or back to war-torn home. So, he sticks around, he meets the janitor, he runs into a emotionally weary flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones, not the best she's done but cute enough), and gets to become familiar company around the huge terminal. It's a huge place, with adversiting that almost makes it like a insular Times Square. During this Viktor goes from befriending the workers, to befriending the attendant, which leads to some romantic interest- or maybe not. Who knows with Viktor's true intentions to stick around for his chance to get into New York City. The reason he ends up telling is, actually, one of the most touching moments in the film, maybe even in the better of Spielberg films.<br/><br/>This isn't, however, overall anything great in the filmmaker's cannon. Maybe not a 'minor' work, but it's often with too much whimsey. Or maybe not; it is a film that is meant as a crowd-pleaser, or a heartwarmer, but at times isn't too sure how to balance between some of the believability the script needs at times (i.e. why is the focus sometimes squarely on Navorski, when its a security station meant to focus on everyone at the airport). The visual styling is impressive, with some cool camera sweeps and tracks in the immense set. But it doesn't add up to anything that marks it as a great film. It also doesn't hold up as well as Spielberg's other films on repeat viewings; on a first go-around it is sheerly entertainment, but once seen again certain scenes bring out some groans. It might be even more enlightening or fun for kids, as it is on that sort of E.T. level. And Hanks' performance, which only shows some dimension towards the last twenty minutes, is good enough, though could've been more.<br/><br/>I guess in short I'm saying that the Terminal is reccomendable, especially as a 'date' movie of sorts, though I wouldn't say to start off with it as the first Spielberg ever. That being said, Kumar Palau (the janitor character, also a Wes Anderson regular), is the best thing about the movie."
"jsong13","8","0","1","12 January 2006"," heart touching on immigrants' point of view
","This is a very nice piece of work by Steven Spielberg. I thought of this movie as being based on a true story of a man trapped at an airport for 2 years as i was watching the film. As an once non-English speaking immigrant who stepped into the foreign airport myself, I found the story very compelling and touching. Tom Hank's actions were terrific, although if there were some drawbacks it was hard to figure out a relative time frame, when and how long things have been happening for in the film.<br/><br/>I actually found the catch phrase ""Do you have an appointment"" quite funny, it would've been strange for non-English speaking non-migrants as the whole movie may not make sense. But everyones been to airports, and facing language barrier is one of the biggest discomforts. Waiting at a airport even for an hour or two seems terrible, but if that goes on for months even years what would it be like? The movie has answered that, as well as giving me an insight into Mr Navoski's airport life very well. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor."
"jtindahouse","8","0","1","12 January 2006"," Really good feel-good film!!!
","Tom Hanks truly is a genius when it comes to acting. This movie just once again proving to us he really can manage anything. The movie itself is pretty decent but let's itself down with a pathetic marriage midway through which just gives the impression they're trying a little too hard to make it a feel-good. The issue of misunderstanding of language can be really funny and I would expect to see it used more after the success of this film.<br/><br/>If you're into feel-goods but you're a little bit old for the Home Alone type then this is probably just the one for you. If you're not big on the whole humor thing and you'd rather see Bruce Willis blowing baddies to bits then I'd take a punt that this movie isn't for you."
"Pookyiscute","10","0","1","7 January 2006"," One of the best films of the year
","It may not have done well at the box office, but this light romantic comedy, is more than that. In fact, I don't even think you could really call it a romantic comedy. It's more a drama about real life, and as far-fetched as it may seem as a realistic story, it could happen, and is cleverly told as a tale.<br/><br/>Arriving at JFK one sunny afternoon, Viktor Navorski (Hanks), goes to the customs booth to get his passport stamped, so that he can enter the land of the free, and the home of the brave. Coming from a country which has been made up for the film, but is similar to an eastern Europe-Russian-Ukranian sort of a country, he does not speak more than a few words in English that he has written down to help him around town. He goes to the head of the airport's office, to speak to them, or more accurately to have them speak to him, and they tell him that because there is a war going on with his country, he does not ""exist"". Until the war in his country is resolved, they cannot allow him to enter the country, but they also cannot allow him to travel back to his homeland, either. He is a resident of the terminal, now. He is given food vouchers, but they can only last so long, and only has the luggage he's been carrying around and the clothes on his back.<br/><br/>The story-line as I said, may sound unreasonably unrealistic, and it may even sound boring, but it is anything but. It is a beautiful piece of work. It will make you laugh, cry and touch your soul at certain parts. It is a human drama, that is not to be taken lightly. It is one of the best films I've ever had the privilege of seeing, and I don't think I could ever get tired of watching it.<br/><br/>Cathrine Zeta-Jones co-leads with Tom Hanks, and plays the beautiful stewardess that he has fallen in love with. <br/><br/>This is again, a romance, drama, comedy and human story. It should be given applauds for the imagination and cleverness that it carries, and everyone involved in the film, whether it be the cast, crew, director, writer or cinematographer, should be complimented on their work.<br/><br/>I recommend to everyone. No one specifically, but everyone. It is an excellent movie, and can be seen with as much of the family as wanted. It's a beautiful movie, and will remain one of my favorites for a long time to come."

"Nozze-Musica","Null","0","1","28 December 2005"," A Cauldron of Advertisement.
","Steven Spielberg invented in film advertisement, and to this day he integrates it so effortlessly into his films, as he did in Minority Report, in an even more blatant manner than here. Every time the Tom Hanks character walks there is some gargantuan advertisement for a Fortune 500 Company. And to me this does conflict with the kind of movie this is supposed to be.<br/><br/>The Tom Hanks character helps a foreigner get medicine to his sick father, convincing customs that the medicine is for his dog, and in the background, shop at Target! The two seem at conflict. A commercial, and a piece of entertainment are two separate things, not one in the same the way Spielberg has made them. So the movie really gets under my skin in that sense. but other than that this is an interesting but not great little movie, far below what Hanks should be doing, and well, considering some of Spielberg's latest work, pretty typical of Spielberg.<br/><br/>This is a solid little movie consisting of a number of familiar faces in nice character roles filling out the staff at the airport where the Tom Hanks character is forced to live, because of a problem with his home country while he is overseas. The situations are humorous and in typical Spielberg fashion over the top, but still manages to be a little more than marginally entertaining. The way that Tom Hanks' life intertwines with those around him is very entertaining and fun to watch. A love story with Catherine Zeta-Jones is interesting, but doesn't add or take away anything from the movie, except discussing her relationship with a man who really doesn't like her but she can't get away from him, at least that's the way I interpreted her relationship.<br/><br/>I think the bottom line with this movie is it tried to capture the Spielberg magic of Indiana Jones or another of his legendary movies but it's set in an airport terminal, not exactly much magical about that. And the bottom line is all of these corporate logos really doesn't create magic, but it does create magic in the form of money for the movie, which I guess is a form of magic to some anyway."

","Well, it doesn't happen often but it was bound to happen again - a so-so Spielberg film. The Terminal seems to be Steven Spielberg on auto-pilot, with an inexcusable amount of product placement which would make any movie-goer want to leave in the middle of the film (an example of this occurs when Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones are in a 2-shot talking to each other, with a Starbucks RIGHT in the middle of the shot - of course, you would realize that a Starbucks in right there). Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones also give so-so performances, as if they realize the script is just an average one. Oh well. The only real plus I can think of is the superb score by John Williams - he for sure wasn't on auto-pilot! An okay 6 out of 10."
"dunmore_ego","4","0","5","11 September 2005"," In-Terminal-ble
","Cast Away meets Perestroika in ""The Terminal"", a movie which cannot decide whether it wants to be a drama, a romantic comedy, or just a silly waste of time. <br/><br/>Unspooling like a film student's exercise in padding, one has to beat oneself about the head to comprehend how the world's arguably greatest director and the world's arguably greatest actor ever acceded to participating in this mundane project. <br/><br/>Forget plot. Forget realistic human behavior. Forget empathy with the characters. But for a few moments which sparkle with the genius of the mega-powers involved (such as the scene where the camera drives home the hero's alienation by panning away from him, showing us his insignificance amidst the madding crowd; also, the ""promise"" fulfilled is a moving affair), the movie is a herky-jerky mish-mash of pish-posh. <br/><br/>Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks, sporting a darn good ""Russian"" inflection) alights at JFK Airport just as his (fictional) country of Krakozhia slides into a military coup. As a result, all Krakozhian passports are suspended and ""unrecognized"" by the U.S. Government; in effect, Navorski cannot go home, nor can he enter the United States - hence, Homeland Security Officer Dixon (the marvelous, multi-faceted Stanley Tucci) relegates Navorski to the confines of JFK Terminal, hoping that he will exit ""illegally"" and become S.E.P. (Somebody Else's Problem). Innocent Viktor, though, chooses not to exit, thereby remaining Dixon's responsibility and causing him insufferable agita. While squatting in the Terminal, Viktor's adventures make us realize just how much more enjoyable it would be to watch paint dry.<br/><br/>I, like many others on this planet, have seen every one of Spielberg's movies (except ""Always""  n.b. chick-flick!) and I think it's safe to say that not even in the irritating ""Lost World: Jurassic Park 2"" are there so many instances where we, the audience, ""fall out"" of the movie so painfully. <br/><br/>The ""falling out"" starts with Dixon's first meeting with Navorski. One wonders how Dixon squishing a bag of potato chips over Navorski's jacket will allow Navorski to allegorically comprehend that his country is in political transience. This scene's deeper message is that government officers like Dixon are so wrapped in their jobs that even a language barrier cannot curb their adherence to verbal protocol. Rest assured, I get it. But inserting that juvenile chip-squishing act removed me from the movie  it was gratuitously Three Stooges and all I could think of were the oil stains that Navorski's jacket would forever be residued with. <br/><br/>Other sequences also offer deeper messages overlaid with trite screen writing, such as the ""medicine-for-goat"" sequence (which almost succeeds  until Dixon recites a statute word-for-word for the viewer's benefit), or the ""juggling waiter"" scene (performed by a character who has just been trying to boost Viktor's chances with his date - now jeopardizing them with his intrusion). How could the great Spielberg allow so many of these jarring sophomoric idiocies into this movie?<br/><br/>Filmed on a gargantuan movie set which could have stamped out Liberia's deficit, stranded Viktor realizes he needs to find: a) food, b) shelter, c) something named Wilson to talk to. The movie's numerous, obtuse sub-plots provide all three. <br/><br/>In one exceptionally inane sub-plot, Viktor intercedes between a shy baggage-handler and the INS officer he worships from afar. Whimsical teens clasp their breasts and sigh deeply  but how many stalking baggage-hounds have those whimsical teens dated recently? That Cyrano de Bergerac vamp only goes so far before you have to reveal the Dork Death you really are That romance led to a contrived marriage, whereupon I ""fell out"" yet again. <br/><br/>Most prominent of the sub-plots is Viktor's romance with stewardess Amelia (a pore-less Catherine Zeta-Jones), who carries so much obvious emotional baggage, she should have 'Samsonite' tattooed on her forehead. Incessantly nattering about Napoleon, incorrectly deemed ""far-sighted"" by the desirous Viktor, the fact that he meets this neurotic slattern whilst she is arguing with her adulterous lover about leaving his wife should have raised red flags immediately. (Guess Tom Leykis isn't broadcast in Krakozhia) Subsequently, after all the energy Viktor expends on this ""romance"" - including building Amelia a fountain! - it amounted to a waste of time (when she declines his love for her married adulterer's) and a wrongful investment of the audience's emotions. The film lost our Trust. <br/><br/>Viktor and Amelia's parting scene is also the worst ""falling out"" example: in a pub, patrons clamor around Viktor, talking to him directly, He ignores them, while Amelia backs away from him. In the real world, if a stranger abjectly pays you no mind, your first instinct is to find others to direct your attention to  but these extras continue blathering at Viktor, the ""rhubarb audio"" progressively getting quieter as the poignancy between Viktor and Amelia grows more intense, thereby dumping us headlong into the Real World, where ""extras"" blather in movies simply to create atmosphere.<br/><br/>In assimilating his English from travelogues, television commercials and baggage-handlers, Viktor becomes far too cognizant of English vernacular; of words and concepts which one could never glean from those lowbrow sources. Thus, communication becomes ""easy"", and the sinister atmosphere pervading Viktor's alienation is diluted. Can we expect anything more from Spielberg these days? After ""Jaws"", he has only colored *within* the PC lines; the world is good and kind and rewarding - Oops, I've fallen again. <br/><br/>Dixon's boss commits a grand ""fallout"" offense when he advises Dixon, ""Compassion  that's the foundation of this country."" I believe he was referring to the pilgrims compassionately liberating the land from the Native Americans. Or was he speaking of the land-owners who compassionately bull-whipped their African slaves? Maybe he meant the Union and Confederacy compassionately disemboweling one another during the American Civil War?<br/><br/>Mr. Spielberg: I've fallen  and I can't get up.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

","The day I saw this Film, I had already seen Collateral. There could not be a greater contrast between two films, and I could especially appreciate that contrast, since I had only 30 minutes between the two shows. Both Films are enjoyable, for different reasons. Collateral is a masterpiece in Film-making, something akin to modern Film-Noir. It is a thrill-a-minute film, with hope suspended for its duration and fear always present. The Terminal is a film which while duly showcasing various fears about Security and Terrorism, seems to swell with Hope from the word go; Hope that the Human race may one day understand that kindness and understanding can overcome anything.<br/><br/>The Film deals with Victor Navorksi (beautifully played by Tom Hanks), a traveller from a (fictional) country called Krakozhia. As he arrives in New York, a civil war erupts in Krakozhia, which creates a diplomatic problem, since the American Government doesn't recognise the sovereignty of Krakozhia anymore. Navorski's passport is no longer valid and all of a sudden he is stuck between two worlds, Krakozhia and America, unable to step into either. Instead, the diplomatic impasse means that he is forced to spend his time in the Airport until his case can be sorted out. In some strange extended transit stay, Navorski literally becomes a a part of the fabric of the International Terminal, much to the anger of Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the guy in charge of the Airport's security. Try as he might, Dixon cant find a way to get Navorski to leave his Terminal. Meanwhile, Victor adapts to his new life and begins to 'live' in the Terminal. He meets new people, like the Airport staff, all of whom try and help him and he eventually falls for Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an air-hostess, who's in a relationship with a married Pilot and who ends up forming a special bond with Victor. We get the feeling they're soul mates - She talks, he's a patient listener. It seems like a match made in heaven. It only adds to Victor's experiences inside the Airport where he gets to see American life in a confined space, thus enjoying America while still not technically in America. <br/><br/>The film gives us an insight into the way Airports function in America today. There is the hovering presence of the Department of Homeland Security, the heightened post 9/11 fears about Air Travel and a slightly generalised attitude towards naive foreigners entering the USA. Navorski's story is shown compassionately and with a great deal of understanding, as are the little side stories about the Spanish Truck driver who's in love with the Immigration Officer or the Indian Janitor, who has a bit of a dark past. But the beauty is that these side stories never deflect from the main storyline, which meanders along at a slightly sedate pace, as Victor juggles his life at the Airport with his feelings for Amelia and his desire to help his new-found friends.<br/><br/>This film was really the perfect antidote to Collateral, which, like I said is another form of film perfection, but also a film which leaves you cold and worried about the fact that Human beings could kill so easily. Here too, humans are shown to be uncaring and cold-hearted, but there is also hope and that is what drives this film - the hope that we may all understand each other one day."

I don't know when they will ever do a movie about the events of 9/11 but I can assure you by watching movies like this and Strip Search with Glenn Close...hmmmm I just know a movie about 9/11 is coming but my thought is why? Why not make the film here in a couple of years and get it out of directors minds. I figured they have more stories out there now that as Hollywood stands right now in sequelpalooza as some people are saying. Why remake and not create originality when there is a lot left. Why isn't Spike Lee doing more movies that reflect and mean something(which I do have to say 25th Hour was pure Lee genius). Why is Oliver Stone doing crappy movies like Alexander when he can be doing Stone movies like JFK and Platoon....I would personally love to see Stone do a movie about Marilyn Monroe's death or O.J. Simpson..you know Stone breaks down walls or is it just the fact like right now in the case of Spielberg that our directors that have been entertaining us for years is just simply getting old and expired? Clint Eastwood is still rocking it and he has a movie right now in pre-production that I'm dying to see so I'm just discombobulated and I will be til' I start seeing movies get on the right track!"

When you get to the foreign country, they won't let you in without a valid passport, which you can't get without a country. So they tell you that you can't leave the airport terminal.

Outstanding performance from Catherine Zeta Jones as believable flight bimbo waiting for Mr. Right and her life to come in for a landing. Some silly scenes exist but the message rings of hope as this man makes his way back from nowhere to achieve his dead Fathers wish. Heartwarming and funny, this movie is well worth your dime."

","but even Tom Hanks can't make a film great if the story isn't there. Hanks plays, Victor, an eastern Europeaner who has come to America only to find out his country doesn't exist politically any more. So, he can't get a visa and is stuck in the airport. The top airport security guy thinks it will just be a few days to straighten it out, but Victor ends up staying months. Along the way he meets a nice flight attendent, played by CZJ, but she really isn't given much to do. Plus, she's not that likable since she's having an affair with a married man. He also befriends other employees of the airport. He helps them, and they give him food and help set up dates with CZJ. The head guy sets up schemes to get Victor to leave the airport, but he won't. He can't even get Victor to admit he's fearful-one of the funny scenes. He even gets a job and makes a shrine to CZJ. It ends with him finally getting to do what he came to New York to do. His reason makes you think the money spent on air fare could have been better used since he only planned to stay a day any way. There's also a corny wedding between two airport employees Victor helps set up.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Slow going, not much action. Another disappointment from Spielberg. I don't recommend it unless you have to see everything Hanks is in."

","As a movie about waiting, perseverance, hope (bringing a question from Enrique to Torres everyday) and friendship it is great , but the romantic angle is misleading and disappointing. I loved the three friends and how they bond. But why bring Catherine Zeta-Jones into the picture? A romance is developed and then it goes nowhere, just like the past relationships of her character. What did she do for him? Get him the one day emergency visa? And was it worth it? Because Dixon denies it to him by blackmailing him with his friendship to the people who helped him. It's his friends who turn it around for him (Gupta delaying the plane), and Dixon's own staff (which he turned against himself by being such a legalist) -- his top guy gives him his coat to go out in the snow. Who were the marketing gurus that let this ending happen? What audiences want is the ""happily ever after"" scenario -- don't mess with the formula if you're in the romantic genre; otherwise, leave romance out of it."

","There were several reasons about why this movie was awesome. First of all, I get really tired of seeing redundant movies. I want to see a movie every once in awhile with substance like this film had. I have an older daughter, 12, who watched it with me. I didn't have to explain too much to her. She understood how clever Victor (Hank character) had become, once he was approached by the acting Airport Commissioner, and how he was even more empowered when he began to grasp the Englsih language. Another reason it was great is that we got to see the commitment Victor had to his dead father. How many of us wouldn't have bolted for the door. I also appreciated how Mr. Spielberg showed that many times, the ""man"" is always trying to get us down, and that many times, we can ""stick it to him"" with intelligence."

","This is one of those Spielberg films that are terrific but are not treated as so. Tom Hanks stars again in another Spielberg film. Once again Hanks gives an excellent performance. Pointing the finger at airlines, government, American is a post 991 world and humanity, The Terminal is too excellent to be treated as so. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci also give great performances. Tucci showcases a true evil that can be seen in today's society. Although he is not the ""bad"" guy like most monsters in horror movies, Tucci is the force that keeps the hero from winning the day. Zeta-Jones does a great job reminding the audience that she is beautiful. Still, she adds to the story and helps bring out the best in Tom Hanks. It was interesting that in many ways, Tom Hanks plays Viktor like Charlie Chaplin. In many scenes, we see the Tramp in his walk. The people around him treat him as the wandering Tramp that by the end of the movie makes his mark on us all."

","The Terminal is a fun movie, but has no real plot and lacks direction. The lack of a plot that makes any sense (it sort of has one, but a really dumb one) drags the movie out for longer than necessary. It has some very funny scenes, but just as many that really don't make any sense. Hanks puts on an unrealistic but funny character, including accent. I really hate it, though, when a movie is unrealistic. At least there should be a plausible idea behind what the characters do. Places and accents should be realistic. Don't make stuff up. Plus, does every movie have to have a love story? It's as if they have to throw one in there for good measure. This movie has more than one. And one ends up in a marriage after the first date. That's ridiculous. There's also a bad guy thrown in there for good measure.<br/><br/>I've come to expect this kind of movie from Hollywood. Entertaining, but disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun movie. Just don't watch it expecting a movie that makes any sense."

","I had heard mixed things before watching this movie, and I was fully prepared to hate it despite my loyalty to Tom Hanks. I was thoroughly surprised, not just because of my low expectations, but because it's a rare thing to see a movie this tenderly crafted as well as acted.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' brilliance goes without saying. He obviously has mastered his character and it shines through every scene. An excellent counterpart to him is the devious Stanley Tucci who provides a surprisingly small amount of antagonism. Much of the film's conflict comes from other sources, such as the employees at the airport, Hanks' relationship with the stewardess (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), or Hanks' simple techniques for surviving within the terminal.<br/><br/>While it would have been very easy for the writers/filmmaker to become trite and boring, the film is masterfully shot and every scene feels important. Not only are the scenes visually beautiful, but there is an emotional resonance contained within them as well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there were a lot of different clichéd paths this film could have taken which easily could have ruined it. It didn't play up the touchy-feely aspects, it didn't overly pursue the love interest or make it become unrealistically pertanent towards the end, and it concluded the film with quiet satisfaction. Unfortunately, movie-goers are programmed to expect something big at the end of a film, and when something quiet and human concludes a film, it is looked at as boring and anti-climactic. This is anything but the case.<br/><br/>Definitely worth renting and watching, at least once. If for nothing else than the expert cinematography and Hanks' performance."

","Tom Hanks is both funny and touching in this 2004 release. The terminal is about a man from the fictional country of Karkozia that is taken over by revolutionaries. Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is stuck in JFK airport because his his home country no longer is recognized by the U.S. so his passport and visa are no good. He can't return home because of the revolution and can't enter the U.S. because of the visa situation. What is created is a sometimes hilarious, sometimes thought provoking film that I was surprised that I enjoyed so much. Many reviewers compared Tom Hank performance to that of Forrest Gump and I have to agree. He can take an out of the ordinary character and make him into someone we laugh WITH and not AT as so many people tend to do with those that are different.

","This is a movie that worth watchin' from the beginning till end. Tom Hanks act is just great. <br/><br/>One could say that Steven Spielberg is a historian, documenting human emotion on film for the past 20 years. With each new film, Spielberg addresses a different issue but never fails to incorporate the basic emotions that pulse through everyone's body. <br/><br/>His movies are remarkably touching, realistic and passionate about human nature. In this film, The Terminal, Spielberg reveals a little bit of his own mind as he introduces the audience to Viktor Navorski.<br/><br/>Hanks is brilliant as the Russian immigrant, bringing both subtlety and vigor to the character with his dead-on accent and genuine attention to Navorski's quiet lifestyle. Jones and Tucci add a desirable flavor of personality to the cast, but it's Hanks and his team of airport misfits (Chi McBride, Diego Luna and Kumar Pallana) who control the story's momentum. One of Spielberg's finest films to date and a definite Oscar contender, ""The Terminal"" is the perfect picnic away from a summer of big explosions and gaudy sequels."

","As stated in my title, I generally find Tom Hanks/ Spielberg movies to be totally monotonic and untextured, but I was entirely and delightfully surprised by this movie.<br/><br/>First of all (and I can't believe I'm saying this!) Hanks was absolutely fantastic in this movie--you forget who he is within a minute, and enjoy his utterly perfect depiction (including amazing accent!) of a stranded, bumbling-but-perceptive, idealistic-but-realistic, Eastern European man at the airport (indeed, it's a sign of a truly great performance when you focus on the character and NOT the marketed actor).<br/><br/>The supporting cast--especially the actor who plays Gupta, the elderly Indian janitor--are also fantastic, and help create an incredibly rich palette of character types that help make this movie so delightful.<br/><br/>And as cliché as the metaphor may seem, the themes of the airport ""Terminal""--of people always coming and going but never taking the time to wait in between; or of people who spend their whole lives waiting but never go anywhere--are well-portrayed and very moving, without disturbing the comedic tempo of the movie (I swear I felt so moved, but laughed aloud multiple times). There are also some underlying themes about the ""-cracies"": democracy, bureaucracy, hypocrisy, etc.<br/><br/>Only annoying thing about the movie was the excessive number of product placements (Sbarro, Planters, Burger King, and so on)--though actually even this was kinda turned into a funny thing in a Truman-Show kind of way.<br/><br/>-->BTW, this movie definitely had some The Truman Show overtones to it, with the possibly kind-hearted but impossibly pedantic little bureaucratic man playing god from ""above"" (parallels between Tucci's and Harris' characters). Other Truman Show themes included freedom within constrained parameters, paradox of innocent idealism combined with realistic survival (Hanks and Carrey's roles), and of society micro-cosmically represented in an isolated community (airport, TV set).<--<br/><br/>Anyway, I highly recommend this movie!!! ~sone"

","This is terribly unlike Spielberg. The script holds so tightly to the theme that it forces itself into unrealistic scenarios and situations. While the whold idea may be fresh and ""plausible"", in today's terror security environment, it is obviously a force fit. This looks badly like a script from pre-911 that did a poor job of updating which happens often in this business. In some stages it resembled commercial television which is not a compliment. This transparency comes through and the audience that spends the price to be entertained today, unless under the age of 13, sees through this so easily, it is not even an entertaining ""feel good"" or ""date"" flick. Too much dependence on big names to carry this to help cover the investment. Thank God I waited to rent the DVD rather than go to the theater. This is a perfect example of bad market studies, reliance on DVD sales to bail a mediocre script, and embarrassing to the team that attempted to make this feasible so to entertain. The cast did not match the audience that this would entertain. This film hurts the credibility of all involved and feel bad for them if they continue to be ""forced"" into this quality of production.

"Xploitedyouth","Null","0","1","25 November 2004"," The bestworst goodbad movie of 2004
","Steven Spielberg's THE TERMINAL is a sweet, annoying, well-performed, over-long, heartwarming, schmaltzy, charming, sugary, cute mess. As you can probably tell, I'm pretty torn about what to think of it. While most of my adjectives about sound like contradictions, anyone who's seen the film will know that they're all pretty accurate. And it's not like it's alternating, like it's sweet, then annoying. No, it's all these things at the same time.<br/><br/>The film is about Victor Navorsky (Tom Hanks), an immigrant from the fictional nation of Krakhozia. During his flight to America, his country went to war, and a military coup left the nation unrecognized by the United States. So, as the smug customs agent who greets Navorsky (Stanley Tucci) explains, Victor is without a country. So, technically, they can't issue him a Visa, so he can't go into New York. They also can't deport him. So, Victor is stuck in the terminal indefinitely. He fashions a bed out of two rows of those nasty padded airport chairs, makes money for food by returning luggage carts for quarters, and learns to speak English through magazines. In the meantime, he makes friends with some of the janitorial staff, including Joe (Chi McBride), Enrique (Diego Luna), and Gupta (Kumar Pallana), and falls in love with the stewardess Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Victor eventually lands a contracting job at the airport, where he makes $19 and hour, under the table. Tucci, meanwhile, tries to encourage Victor to leave the airport, so that he's America's problem, and not his. For unknown reasons, Victor stays behind. For nine months.<br/><br/>I don't find the premise entirely unbelievable. This is actually based on a true story, and the real guy allegedly lived in the airport for 17 years. That's not the problem I have. The problem comes with well, everything else and nothing else. <br/><br/>Let's start with the performances, particularly Hanks. At first, hearing him speak broken English or some ridiculous made-up language that sounds like drunken mumbling is annoying. Eventually, we get used to it and can appreciate the subtleties of his performance. We get to like Victor, but from there, more problems arise. Why doesn't he just leave the terminal? He's given every opportunity, told that he will not be penalized for leaving, and yet he stays behind. Why? It's never explained. Next, Tucci's bureaucratic villain. Again, the performance is competent, but we don't really know what motivates him. Why would he want to expedite someone from the airport so badly, when he's not causing a problem? For example, when he learns that Victor is returning carts for quarters, he hires somebody to put the carts away instead. So now, Victor is still stuck in the airport, but he can't eat. What purpose does this serve? On to Catherine Zeta-Jones, who, again, gives a good performance, but her character is obnoxious. She's whiny, she's needy, she's clearly using Victor, but for what, we don't know. Companionship? A shoulder to cry on? When the romance between them doesn't pan out, we don't really care, because we like Victor, not Amelia, and we're sure he can do better.<br/><br/>There are problems with tone, as well. The whole ordeal is very muted, until the last third of the movie, where Victor becomes a sort of airport folk hero and all the food court employees rally to his aid. I liked it better early on, when we're left to just observe Victor. Hanks proved in CAST AWAY that he can carry a film on his own, without any subplots or arbitrary supporting characters. This one throws too much at us. The subplot about Enrique and a beautiful customs agent (Zoe Saldana) falls completely flat on it's face. Are we really supposed to believe that a woman could fall in love with someone she's never met, all because some cryptic messages are delivered to her in fragmented English by a middle-aged man who lives at the airport? I suppose the message is about love at first site, but love at first, 'What you do, in free time?' I highly doubt it. Then there's Gupta, who seems to be the comic relief but isn't funny. <br/><br/>There were several moments that made me smile. I liked Victor's explanation for being in New York, and I liked the scene where Hanks translated for a desperate immigrant trying to get medicine back to his dying father. But the whole thing is so sloppy thrown together, so manipulative and inconsistent, that I can't help but bunch it with 1941 and THE LOST WORLD as one of Spielberg's costly misses."

Not only was I amazed by the brilliant plot, but I was hugely impressed with the cinematography, although it did chop and change from location to location within the airport with no real smooth transition between them, it was still quite spectacular. I have heard a lot of people call this 'A mediocre movie' with was 'Nothing Amazing'. With these people I would beg to differ. Spielberg has managed to direct this compelling drama and gel it perfectly with a love story. I have to say I was a little more than impressed by this movie.

","The Terminal is an unlikely story of a traveler who is stranded in New York's JFK airport because his country's (a fictitious Eastern European nation) government has just been overthrown, and the immigration officials refuse to admit or deport him. He is stuck in the transit lounge, and must survive as best he can.<br/><br/>The story has a familiar ring to it: the protagonist is stranded by unfortunate circumstances, but by his ingenuity, he survives and even prospers in the face of opposition. What's new is the setting - how Spielberg turns the modern international transit lounge (a comfortable place nowadays - shops, restaurants, amenities) into a cold forbidding place populated with strangers.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays the role of a foreign visitor who has to rely on his wits at first, but in the end he prospers because his honest nature has won the trust and friendship of the airport workers. He even catches the eye of an air stewardess (Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is simply luminous!) while struggling with the bureaucrats running the airport who conspire to deny him his chance to get out.<br/><br/>The film does require that the viewer suspends his sense of reality for a while - in one scene, Hank's character gets a job as a building worker in the airport after a painting a wall in a single night with such skill that he impresses the foreman. And he learns a new language by comparing the foreign language version of Fodor's travel guide to the English version.<br/><br/>Happily, I must say that these imperfections do not detract from the spirit of the movie, and can heartily commend it to those who are looking for a well-scripted story with an excellent cast.

","The Terminal 8/10<br/><br/>This is a movie you'll love or errr . . . feel left a bit cold by - so maybe a few notes to help you decide which . . . ?<br/><br/>The story is of a man stranded at an airport, his papers invalid for entry or exit, and ending up living there for a while (all this is based on a true story). The difficulty is getting a handle on it. Is it serious drama? Light romantic comedy? Deliberate slapstick? Is it meant to be realistic or not? If these questions are likely to plague you and make you unable to settle and enjoy The Terminal, it's maybe not the movie for you. On the other hand, imagine it was a musical - you'd have all these elements and no-one would really care. Perhaps the film would have been more successful as a musical even - as audiences we have a happy acceptance that includes a very wide suspension of disbelief when the people we are watching suddenly feel the need to break into song and dance - we are there to be entertained after all; and if you avoid pigeon-holing the film you might find it a very enjoyable experience indeed.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is superbly cast in the lead role. His home country (somewhere in Eastern Europe probably) has undergone a coup whilst he has been in flight. Consequently all documentation (visas, passports) from the country have been suspended - his papers are not valid for entry to the USA and neither can he be forcibly sent home. The puzzlement and isolation of a man who speaks little or no English and has no idea what is happening to him is poignantly portrayed. But rather than lead us into consideration of serious issues that might be raised, director Steven Spielberg drops to a minor key to develop a romantic comedy between Hanks and air-hostess Catherine Zeta-Jones. As an audience we have to let go of the desire to see it as a serious drama and just have fun, though with serious issues in the background. Spielberg, not my favourite director, almost redeems himself from his habitually apologetic political correctness over an incident involving a Russian (Where Hanks is brought in as a translator) who is trying to bring medicines in for his dying parent without proper paperwork. Realising that no paperwork is needed if the medicines are needed for veterinary purposes, Hanks feigns a mistranslation to get the Russian to say they are for his goat. In the face the heartless chief of security, it looks like a swipe at bureaucracy, suggesting the system cares more about goats than people - but this is quickly dispelled when another staff person says that America is after all, built on compassion.<br/><br/>The original story is much closer to home - an Iranian refugee, Merhan Nasseri, landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport France in 1988 after being denied entry into the UK because his passport and United Nations refugee card had been stolen. He was not allowed into France and he did not want to return to Iran (his home country) - he was fleeing as a political refugee. He ended up living in Terminal One of the airport for more than 16 years. (He's now been granted permission to either enter France or return to his own country but he instead chooses to carry on living in the terminal. <br/><br/>The film is professionally made, deftly crafting schmaltz with top acting, and a theme that, if not original, at least hasn't been done to death. It's unusualness is probably its biggest downfall - it wants to be mainstream but doesn't conveniently fit into a category. It also goes on for rather a long time - at over two hours there creeps in a feeling that you've been stranded watching his (however interesting) plight long enough and it's about time he got the girl and went out to celebrate. Personally I didn't get bored - only a little sad - not just from the soppy tear-jerker aspects - but from the feeling that more people should enjoy this movie than probably will let themselves."

","A light presentation of one-man struggle with bureaucracy and prejudice against foreigners. Sadly, Viktor Navorski, a man, who planned only a short term visit in New York city, is stuck at the airport, because of unfortunate events in his country and the American officials' inability to deal with this unexpected situation. The story shows how one man, against all odds, manages to provide for himself and his needs using only his own wits. Although not popular with the officials, he's friendly character earns him friends among other ordinary people. Although set in the US this drama could have take place anywhere in the world, where foreigners (especially eastern-Europeans) are still considered second-class citizens."

","The Terminal ***1/2 (out of four). <br/><br/>I saw this film because i didn't found something more attractive at the theater's box office. I had seen the trailer before, and wasn't really much taken to see the film. But how big was my surprise! I definitively loved the movie! its really entertaining, it's been a while since I didn't had this much fun at the movies!!! <br/><br/>Every thing starts when Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) a citizen from an eastern European country, arrives to the New York City Terminal and finds out that it has erupted a civil war in his homeland while he was in the air traveling to America, situation that left him off limits of the USA and not able to go back to his country, so this is how he becomes resident of the NYC Terminal. And although he doesn't speak a bit of English, he manages to keep it together and decides to wait for his permission to enter the States, and wait.... and wait! During this long wait of him, he meets the flight assistant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta Jones) and quite interesting people from the airport staff which includes airport official Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), Joey Mulroy (Chi McBride), Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), Officer Ray Thurman (Barry Shabaka H.), Janitor Gupta (Kumar Pallana) and Officer Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana). Every scene of the film we get to see great challenge situations for the pure hearted Viktor along with the rest of the characters (which felt that fitted perfectly in the story) and we really get to live that along with them.<br/><br/>This warm and entertaining film's highly recommended and enjoyable for everyone. It may have some weak parts, but the whole final result will delight you! If you haven't seen it, this is your option at the multiplex in your next visit!!!"

","I loved this movie sooo much when we went to see it in the theaters! Most of the movies out were funny, but full of bad words and crude humor. Now I just love ""gross movies"" (think Austin Powers) but The Terminal was a very refreshing change. Tom Hanks always seems to pick the best roles and he makes every movie such a pleasure to watch, but this character was probably the most lovable of them all. The humor is innocent and simple, but it made the whole crowd laugh uncontrollably throughout the whole movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn't make as many appearances as we would have liked but in the small parts that she has, she manages to completely nail her character. I think that the chemistry that all the characters have together, added to the general concept of this movie, makes it so enjoyable to watch and gives it a great message. It's a movie that you can go to just to relax in and enjoy yourself, and is a movie that no one should go without seeing again and again."

","This is Spielberg when he is good, which kicks the ass of most people working in Hollywood today at their best. Just like the saying that even bad Hitchcock is better than most other's best. I am amazed how people just can't relax and enjoy a decent film these days, judging by the reviews here. There is nothing in this film that is less than good. The acting is excellent and Spielberg's direction is effortless and undistracting. Except for a few over the top transitions and cuts the flow and blocking of scenes is the very definition of understated excellence. Can't anyone appreciate this anymore because it is in fact quite rare. Very few Directors have this much assurance in technique and it should be savored. Instead of going out of his way to show us how visually good he is, he can just relax and let his talent shine without making a big deal out of it. It's a pleasure to watch just for that alone."

","Steven Spielberg tells the tale of an Eastern European man who gets stuck at JFK due to a series of unfortunate circumstances. The premise of the film is a good one, the injection of 'comedy' into the proceedings, however, isn't. Not much in the way of laughs here unfortunately, I only recall ""we don't play for money, we play for unclaimed items from the lost and found"" making any sort of impression on me - oh, and not forgetting the discovery of why flight attendants are always smiling.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is the man with the unenviable task of pulling off a Krakozian accent  and in the end seemingly turns to Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat for help, ""As we say in Kazhakstan...""  but his isolated character does bring back good memories of his 'Castaway' turn.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>A few interesting points to notice: how Victor arrives in the US with only ""Yes"" and ""No"" to his English vocabulary, yet only days later is near fluent after purchasing a handbook from an airport shop and watching a news report. Plus, it was too long  the subplot with the Indian man is unnecessary and him stepping in front of a Boeing at the end is ridiculous in the extreme. Also, Catherine Zeta-Jones is totally wasted  either that, or the romance was just thrown in as a Spielberg 'crowd pleaser' and then abandoned mid-point because of the complete lack of credibility.<br/><br/>And the token sappy Spielberg ending doesn't disappoint either. Apart from the Indian on the runway, we also get half of the airport following Hanks down an escalator (why? - not everybody in the airport is gonna know, or care, about the guy), and then to top it off we get a member of airport security going against orders and actually giving Hanks his jacket. Then we get snow. Terrible ending."
"bopdog","6","0","2","6 September 2004"," Textured and deep, life-like and worthy, but not a ""funny"" comedy as it had been advertised to be
","""The Terminal"" was advertised as a comedy, but it wasn't at all funny--- It had texture, however,and some depth, and addressed some issues of human life that may be important. It is a worthy artistic piece, so overall it was a good movie nonetheless.<br/><br/>One of the movie's qualities--- and both a strength and a weakness--- was the evident lack of single purpose, or, perhaps, obvious point. That is, it was unclear what the movie was actually about, and it was equally unclear what the movie was trying to say. Was it saying governments are mean? Borders are bad? Individual humans are mere victims at the whim of political and social powers? I sure couldn't tell what the movie folks thought about the issue, and that was a bit ""deflating"" as far as my emotional involvement went. That might also explain why some readers here, for example, criticize the movie for being over-long and/or boring.<br/><br/>On the other hand, raising such issues, especially in today's security conscious borders, is important. And raising the issues and providing clear and strong answers would have been a disservice to the audience. Leaving the questions unanswered, and simply percolating along, and the audience free to make up their own minds--- or at least give the matter some serious thought--- was a rarity in movies today, and a welcome bit of respect for us from Steven Spielberg as the director.<br/><br/>An example of the disjointed vibe some folks have mentioned--- What was Catherine Zeta Jones' character doing in this movie? What was her character's purpose, and place in the scheme of things? Dunno... and that was a bit disconcerting. On the other hand, isn't life frequently like that? Don't we often encounter diverse and dis-connected phenomena, and attach what purpose to those things as suits our own little world at any given time? I think so--- The other characters were equally non-seqeutious--- but also equally plausible in the world of the central character, played by Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Overall, then, I liked this movie well enough, even with a touch of disappointment after finding that it was wasn't, as it had been advertised, a funny comedy."

","What would happen to you if you knew that your country no longer exists? Or put it in another way, while your country cease to exist, you are actually flying thousands of meters above sea level to another country, what will you do? Tom Hanks, in this Steven Spielberg production, was one of the unlucky person whom was denied access to the United States of America, and had to stay in the airport. During his stay, he got his way through by his usual acts of living skills. He got his way around, knowing people, getting away most of the time from problems, only to find himself landing into another problem. His acting skills definitely put laughs in the cinema as we watched him acting out so naturally as what a foreigner would do if they would visit another different country. Catherine Zeta-Jones is stunning and beautiful, and the part of the movie where it had romance, began from there. The story, even though predictable, it amplified the nature of a foreigner and gives a wonderful laugh throughout the whole movie. Spectacular performance, and wonderful directing. I would rate it a 8.5/10. Worthwhile watching!"
"Nonretard","Null","0","1","2 August 2004"," Anyone see it?
","Spoiler Sure did. Tom Hanks is probably, toe for toe, the greatest actor that ever lived. If I was a gal, I'd probably sleep with him. Though, sleeping probably wouldn't be a key factor. <br/><br/>As for the film and the character Hanks plays, it's got a sappy structure with out-of-this-world rare necessities. Case in point: A pretty hawt Flight Attendant. However, potential case inside the point: I've never flown United Airlines. I guess there's an exclusive mystique to it, then. <br/><br/>Hank's character, Victor, is written well; though there are a few contradictions served up only to produce several retarded gags. He's not a fish outta water entirely, but a fish in an entirely new tank. When first faced with the changes of his environment and confines of his new prison (because his homeland in Eastern Europe is under hostile takeover); he scatters up the escalator. No, not the escalator with people coming DOWN; the escalator for going up. Just because he hasn't grasped a strong enough hold around the English language doesn't mean he can't tell the difference being going up and going down. He doesn't fall for tricks that involve leaving the airport. When some schmuck in Airport Security tries to not make Victor HIS problem and insists on Victor to leave the airport to be mugged, taken advantage of, or arrested; Victor pretty much is left staring at the exit doors until he's reached the decision that it's not safe to leave. Is that smell does not mistake me: I'd say that this is kind of an achievement in film making, if you ask me. Well, almost.<br/><br/>The character, however, is manipulated thanks to a few contradictions. Realizing that he must seduce his love-interest of a flight attendant, Amelia (Catherine Zeta Jones), Victor looks for a job in the airport. With many shops located throughout the International Lounge Terminal in JFK Airport, Victor chooses one store... then another, then another, then another. It's not the contradiction that Victor is now DUMB enough to tell the truth to store managers about where he lives (""..Did you say 'GATE 67'?""), or the fact he's actually reluctant about getting a job. Maybe it's his over-jovial actions. When the manager of a store asks for his phone number, he immediately has the idea of using the number of a pay phone RIGHT outside the store. Not before turning around and running right smack into the store's display window (BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR. HA. HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN OPENING), Victor actually waits around all day and night at the payphone to receive the verdict on whether or not he's hired. The call comes, with the store manager standing right in front of the same window Victor came lips to lips with, holding the phone. Victor proceeds to pick up the ringing receiver on the pay phone, and proceeds to hold a conversation. Yet, he remains unaware that the pay phone is right in front of the store, and yeah: the manager knows he's full of it. When told someone has already been hired for the job, Victor is just tired and ready to hit the hay. All the stores are being closed at this time, and before Victor returns to Gate 67; he runs to the nearest bathroom in dying need to take a leak.<br/><br/>And yes, he accidentally runs into the Women's Room. <br/><br/>And yes, a woman is heard screaming.<br/><br/>Ah well.<br/><br/>A pretty decent supporting cast with Kumar Pallana as Gupta help mold the character that is Victor into a rare oddity that is never seen in films, these days. He's not an idiot, despite Spielberg's attempt to lay bear traps for him to clumsily trip over. It doesn't hurt the character, however, that he's still looked at like an ordinary man with goals, dreams, and promises to keep. He's an oddity to the audience (running into windows, into the Women's bathroom), until the end of the film. He's not here to WOW the city of New York, or to fall in love. Hence, the ending (which is great) isn't him marrying the flight attendant or him reaching the top floor of the Empire State Building. It's him fulfilling a promise he made to himself, and returning home.<br/><br/>3 OJ Mugshots out of four."

","As one other writer has phrased it,""What a shame"". Apparently Spielberg has been on one of his outer space locales for too long. How could he be so out of touch with the modern world that he could place an individual in a world without computers? Maybe this story is based on an incident that happened fifty years ago or something. <br/><br/>I was so disappointed. The story has such an interesting premise. I thought this film was going to tell about how amazing it is at an modern airport. To tell about all the resources that are available to anyone visiting an airport. I thought that the character was going to make use of the resources at hand and advance himself somehow. Like a modern Robinson Crusoe. <br/><br/>My objection to the film and the reason that I feel it is out of touch is that the main character only relies on news from television to tell him that his country is temporarily out of order. In this story the computer doesn't seem to have been invented yet. <br/><br/>The character has access to all of the knowledge at a Border's bookstore and manages to teach himself English; still he doesn't discover the address of any helpful individual. (I mean, in any movie about Martians the first thing they say is, ""Take me to your leader."" Spielberg should be familiar with that phrase and yet our hero never tries to contact anyone.) And the character never uses the English language to say ""Get me to a computer"". With all the information at a Border's bookstore a person would find out eventually that there is this invention called a computer and with it one is in touch with the entire world. One could contact a local news agency to tell them about one's plight or one could contact local officials or Federal officials. One would learn that these are the ways that one gets action in America. With enough time one might learn about what laws could benefit one instead of just being at the mercy of the local airport dictator. Or as I said, just saying in English that one needs to get to a computer would supply you with all you needed to know in Russian. If one didn't know how to use a computer one could find a book at Border's about the how to use the computer. ---I mean this man was supposed to be smart enough to teach himself English and he had nine months to figure out what to do. <br/><br/>There are so many stories about individuals in situations where they have nothing and yet they ingeniously manage to manipulate their environments and to survive, to prosper; still this individual with virtually the entire world at his disposal via the written word at a bookstore and the invention of the internet in the modern world only manages to figure out how to earn enough money to purchase a brand name hamburger and a brand name suit. ---Oh I get it.

","It is great to be company with two other perceptive viewers of movies, roshnir and i-love- tom-hanks. I also agree that there is a political statement being made about the red tape in the U.S. and Homeland paranoia. One can see with the scene where a fellow Eastern European was caught bringing in prescriptions to the U.S. for his father. He was bringing it from Canada and the scene is about the exorbitant and ridiculous cost of prescription meds, here in the U.S. and the satire of the pharmaceutical companies and the role of the government and restrictions imposed upon the consumer in dire need of the meds. Here, he is let go if it is for his goat, then it is admissible. All these rules and regulations which dictates the U.S. law and government comes into play. Furthermore, in the beginning of the movie, Commissioner Dixon tries to figure out all these regulations and codes to bypass his problem and to get Viktor (Tom Hanks) out of his hair, bald though he is, not to criticize Tucci. <br/><br/>Another tidbit is in the very beginning of the movie. It is ironic that the we are asked by passing through security we are always asked, ""Are you here for business or pleasure."" There are a couple of shots showing this ridiculous question. We are like in a processing line, like robots giving our standard cookie cutter response from a cookie cutter question. I always think about the California cheese TV commercial. The security person asks us, ""What is your reason for visiting California?"" Everyone is different but they all say ""the cheese."" When this unfortunate fellow says something else rather than cheese, he is whisked away. Funny but that says something about our government. To get to the point, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. And come on, do we always have to have the cookie cutter ending where the guy always gets the gal. What made Casablanca great? As roshnir says:""subtlety"" of this movie is very skillfully done and I'm glad Spielberg took on this film and know why. <br/><br/>It is not a stretch for the imagination, such contrivances are based on a true incident Gazzo2! For the story to be believable, it would take 9 months to birth the relationships that Viktor (Tom Hanks) has with all the employees at JFK. And the little Indian guys does stop an airplane not just spinning plates. Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) falls for Viktor on meeting him in happenstance initially and other occasions that builds up to their relationship which does take TIME. It is conceivable that a country would take months to get its affairs in order. If you look a little deeper you would be engaging your mind rather than going on autopilot. The tagline is: ""Life is waiting."" If you took the time to look between the lines, you probably would have got a better perspective of the movie. The cuteness of the Tom Hanks is played to a tee and he fit this role perfectly. This is not meant to be an action packed movie. Maybe that is why the zzzzzzz's. Look for a pleasant surprise about life and its twists and turns. Take the TIME to see this movie."

","The general plot is outlined in another comment so we can forgo that here. Let's just say that it is not Tom Hank's best effort but that is probably not his fault.<br/><br/>The premise stretches the limits of credulity. While this is not uncommon in this genre, I found myself unable to ""suspend disbelief"" for more than 4 or 5 minutes in a stretch. Hank's character teaches himself English from a book shoplifted from Borders (in a single evening, it would appear). The Homeland Security supervisor is unable to interest any agency in holding him and apparently his own department has no such facilities either. The airport in which Hanks finds himself stranded is JFK but all the people are surprisingly friendly, cordial, and respectful of others (remember the taxicab dispatcher in Sleepless in Seattle? ""Why don't you get a little farther from the curb, mack?"". Now that's New York). And so on.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint, though, is the length. With a running time of over two hours, it became tedious. The director could have made it both better and shorter by eliminating the pointless romance that went nowhere and benefited neither party."
"diabloguy24","6","0","1","23 July 2004"," Tacky
","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>Okay I had to write an essay on this film and here it is:<br/><br/>The Terminal: a film with a compelling title, a compelling story, and a compelling cast. In my preview journal, I have set high anticipations for the film and my movie-going experience. But is the movie truly worth the hype? The Terminal, although a decent feel-good comedy/drama, suffers because of script and acting errors, coupled with a loss of focus and a ludicrous finish. <br/><br/>The Terminal is a recent comedy/drama directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Amelia.<br/><br/>To abridge the plot, Viktor Navorski arrives in New York from the fictitious republic of Krakozhia, only to be detained from entering the States because of a political coup inside of his country. Navorski cannot enter New York, and neither can he go back. He is forced to stay at the airport's international terminal. During his 9-month stay at the terminal, Viktor learns English,makes friends, falls in love, and makes trouble for Frank Dixon, the airport' s evil security and immigration officer (played by Stanley Lucci). The film is 2:09 in duration, has many sub-plots and frequently goes off on a tangent. In basis, the movie attempts to convey a foreigner's unfamiliarity and him accustoming with a new life.<br/><br/>The Terminal in spirit is a heart-warming feel-good drama. Despite frequent clichés and tacky romance, the film establishes this spirit for three fourths of its duration. However, the plot suffers from many obvious holes and mistakes. At the time Viktor Navorski arrives at the airport (which is a vast multi-million dollar set erected exclusively for this cinema) and is denied clearance, he is allowed to reside within the terminal complex. As message boards point out, by law he would have to be detained in a prison (which would not make for a very good story).<br/><br/>The movie theatre itself and my fellow viewers were a practical microcosm to help me build my opinions of The Terminal. The audience seemed to notice when something in the film was in disarray, and laughed at the humorous moments. Indeed, many parts in this film were comical, helping to provide a light aura to the plot. The acting of this picture is decent, though Hanks plays much too enthusiastically. He obtains the role of an Eastern European man and twists him into a juvenile buffoon. Hanks' voicing in particularly outlandish: he tries for a thick, Slavic accent, but ends up speaking in Bulgarian for the entirety of the film. One side-plot is particularly comical: a Russian traveler purchases medicine in America in order to cure his father back home, then is asked to withhold these medicines. The Russian threatens to commit suicide, and Navorski is brought in as a translator. The evil terminal czar Frank announces that '[The Russian] lives across from Krakozhia's border, and may converse in a different dialect.' As anticipated, the Russian man and Viktor comprehend each other beautifully. After an explanation that these pills are for a goat, the Russian man is set free to take a plane back home. As a show of Hollywood ignorance and simplicity, this could be deemed the worst episode in the film, and one may suppose it could have been a lot more elementary for Hanks to speak in Russian. If The Terminal tells an intriguing story leading up the climax, then the story's conclusion spells death for a potentially high-quality production. Many plot-loops are amiss in the film's conclusion. Viktor's love interest Amelia Warren regresses yet again to her boyfriend, murdering half the plot and tarnishing a happy ending. The Indian airport janitor Gupta (played by Kumar Pallana) makes an unexplained sacrifice for Navorski. Gupta delays Navorski's plane back to Krakozhia by running out onto the tarmac and stopping the arriving airplane with his mop. Gupta is then held at gunpoint by a SWAT team, and taken back to India, where he will wither away in jail for seven years, as a result of attacking a policeman years ago. The story, naturally, does not make any note of this. All too late in the movie, the audience learns Viktor's absurd motive for coming to America in the first place: to receive a signature from a jazz player (who has evidently played at the same hotel in New York for 9 months). The conclusion of The Terminal breaks apart desperately. <br/><br/>Overall, I had much higher standards and expectations about this movie, due to its cast and the director's reputation. I am not necessarily in favor of films that portray reality unerringly, however the plot holes were both significant and palpable in The Terminal. Meanwhile I enjoyed the film, better execution and a more realistic script would have cured the movie of its blemishes."

Take pilots/flight attendants, TSA workers, other professionals - I know many who live out of, exactly that, gates under construction, behind stairwells and in nooks and a little hideouts... little, shanties, villages.

Or baggage claim, down the main escalator, there is a coffee shop , behind there is a big TSA village... and around that escalator complex under there, you will see almost a wall put up, with lockers and what have you there. Down below the main doors, another popular place. Closed old United gates, even better. The arch over the people mover hole in the A/B, in there. Its all over. You would be surprised, at the number of pilots/flight attendants, who, have no real home - who shower at the YMCA and share a ""hot swap car"" from the lot. They live at malls too during the day, sleep there at night. Ask any pilot who has walked into the crew room at 4/5AM and flipped on the light. Its homeless city. People sleeping under newspapers.<br/><br/>This stuff happens at airports, everyday... but like all the comments say, you rush in, rush out, everyone is doing their own thing, no one pays attention, no one cares, they just want to get where they are going. Get bored... sometime on a delay, walk around... and look for these things. You'll see em. ¬"

","The Terminal was an enjoyable film. It made me laugh and cry. It is not always necessary to ""reach to the core of humanity"" for a film to be enjoyable. Sometimes ""a cigar is just a cigar"". Sometimes a film is meant to entertain, and if we can find deeper meaning attached,so much the better.<br/><br/>Do you suppose it was as simple as watching a polite man caught in an uncomfortable situation and seeing how he dealt with it? Manners are underused in this world. It was a touching film, and I and my spouse both enjoyed it. The actors did as they should do, they transformed themselves into the characters they portrayed. After a few minutes, it wasn't Hanks but Viktor that I was traveling with through his trials. And do you know, through it all, Viktor displayed the finest qualities of man....gentleness, manners, concern for others. Bravo, the film was lovely."

","I had seen a segment on a well known and respected news show about a man who had been trapped in an airport terminal in Europe for more than a year. Consequently, I went to the movie, Terminal, to see how Spielberg would deal with this kind of topic.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised. Tom Hanks' performance was believable. The supporting cast was strong. I laughed out loud in the theater several times even though I don't do that. I was intrigued with how a foreigner who spoke little English dealt with his circumstances. The virtues of honesty, kindness, loyalty, and patience were embedded throughout the story. I was amazed and amused by the creativeness and inventiveness of Tom and the other characters. I left the theater with a strong sense of hope. It reaffirmed my belief that following the rules, helping others, and having goals, no matter how small or personal, are possible in the most difficult situations. Never give up. People can control how they react to overwhelming difficulties and succeed. I really enjoyed the movie."

","Most unexpected..<br/><br/>First of all I have to confess that I am deeply in love with most of Mr. Spielberg's movies and therefore I was expecting something really special from this movie, plus with Tom Hanks in the main role. But unfortunately it turned out a complete disappointment!! The whole story is so not real, artificial The Hank's character is a 100% nice person with no bad sides, kinda 'angel'. As for the woman character, performed by Zeta-Jones, this character is absolutely predictable and the movie wouldn't lose anything without her! She's only appears so the movie is longer and even more typical, predictable, sticky, sweet, serial Hollywood-made movie, the one that never lasts, nobody is gonna watch it even in 10 years!! Nobody will remember it. It so happens that lately, the movies that are made by great directors, with great actors turn out to be 'much ado about nothing'!!! And those movies, that nobody expects to be good  are really nice and you wish to watch it over and over again!"

","Ok, let's get right down to it. There is a lot wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>1.The concept is absurd.<br/><br/>2.Getting Tom Hanks to do Eastern European was dodgy (He only just has enough skill to allow you to suspend disbelief, ONLY JUST!)<br/><br/>3.Tom Hanks' motive for flying to New York was poor. You THINK you know what is in the peanut can, if it had been what you EXPECT it to be it would have made more sense, but when you find out what it ACTUALLY is you just think, ""That's stupid!""<br/><br/>4. It's too long. Airports are boring places that you want to get out of, (onto your flight) as quickly as possible. At 2hrs 5mins running time, you MIGHT just want to get out of ""The Terminal"".<br/><br/>But, what's RIGHT about the movie?<br/><br/>1. Catherine Zeta Jones is unusually likeable. It is refreshing to see her in ""vulnerable"" mode. I, for one, have had enough of the ""Ice Queen/Bitch"" roles she keeps playing. She's so much more endearing when she is looking beautiful, (as she does in this) AS WELL as playing a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>
2. The comedy elements (whether they are contrived or not) DO WORK! This film does make you laugh!<br/><br/>3. It's heart is in the right place. It may fall a long way short of being an ""It's a wonderful life"", but it IS a film with a heart.(And more sugary-sweet sentiment than a Disney cartoon, blearrgh!) If I had seen this movie in the countdown to Christmas I think I would have ignored all it's flaws and Implausibility and just taken it for what it is... ...Just a simple, silly, story. With a big heart. Family Fodder."

","THE TERMINAL is slick and fast.  It is a picture full of camera moves I could barely comprehend yet I knew were right.  Spielberg and Hanks deliver a delicious blend of comedy and drama, which, at times, is a bit preachy, but easy to forgive.  Set mostly in the same location, the master filmmaker keeps the energy at eleven.  Even when he's delving into his cheese vat, I enjoy watching what this man has to offer.  As a result, I recommend THE TERMINAL highly.  It is the work of a director at the top of his game. Unlike A.I. or HOOK, Spielberg stays away from the mundane glow of carnival lights and provides us with content.  Keep going, wild one, your work is gold!"

","I admit I saw this film with prejudice. <br/><br/>I'm an enthusiastic fan of Spielberg, who I think has taken a bad rap from Hollywood snobbery, and Hanks, who I guess everyone loves. But this movie was quite bad in spite of the talent and my expectations could not overcome that.<br/><br/>The plot became totally predictable. Not remotely believable and at the same time not quite fairy tale enough for me to put that aside. Not quite a comedy not quite a drama. I did laugh out loud several times but in the end it was just so contrived and precious I could not enjoy it.  <br/><br/>
The writing was especially terrible. The interaction didn't work in too many places, and the chemistry between actors was missing. <br/><br/>The antagonist role was also just too stereotypically bad. Tucci is another favorite of mine, and while he played it as well as anyone could, it was just the same old thing in terms of mean bad guy. <br/><br/>The main love story came close, and then got lost in poor dialogue and bad character development choices. Be a comedy or be a drama. The tragic relationship problems of Zeta-Jones reminded me of a sitcom that decides to air ""a very special episode."" Also, I feel she was miscast here, someone older or just ""cute"" as opposed to stunning gorgeous would have worked better. <br/><br/>But most importantly--I was bored. Watching Hanks with no spoken dialogue for minutes on end in Castaway was more interesting than watching his character bumble through his lines in this. Love you Steven but comedy is tough; please don't give up!"
"stodmyk","5","0","4","10 July 2004"," ... I felt like I'd been in the THEATRE for nine months
","Widely publicized and reviewed, it hardly seems necessary to recount the premise for this one. For tradition's sake, here goes: The Terminal is about Viktor Navorsky, a man forced by bureaucracy to live in an airport terminal for months -- his country, the fictional Krakozhia, has been the victim of a bloody coup during his flight, leaving him with no homeland and no international recognition. He begins with no English whatsoever, and finishes with a high-paying job, friends, romance and an impressive command of the English language.<br/><br/>Parts of this film work, and work well. Tom Hanks is one of the most likable guys in Hollywood, both on- and off-screen. Spielberg, no matter how much you lament his success, is a proven storyteller. He pushes buttons like no other filmmaker on the planet. Whether you appreciate her acting chops or not, Catherine Zeta-Jones has a kind of on-screen shine like few of her peers. And the talented Stanley Tucci, at times, is able to inject some feeling into the one-dimensional bureaucrat responsible for Navorski's stay in travel limbo. <br/><br/>All of those things help to make bits of The Terminal palatable -- unfortunately, Spielberg neglected to use the editing parts of his skills with this picture. All the scenes that don't quite work, the ones that usually end up in the 'deleted scenes' portion of the DVD, that drag the story or give unnecessary distraction for a bit of character development... They're all here in the theatrical release which clocks in at a way-too-long 128 minutes.<br/><br/>The screenplay uses every hackneyed script tool that focus groups approve of: snippets of dialogue, charming at first, repeated at key points in the movie to be pithy, insightful or condescending; unlikely combinations of ethnic characters in supporting roles; the unwavering, nasty antagonist who wavers in the end; the heartfelt quest eventually fulfilled; and the gorgeous love interest where real life would serve up, if any, a wholly average human specimen. <br/><br/>These elements are introduced in such a formulaic fashion that not a one surprises. Each step of the way is overly choreographed, and unfortunately, well-telegraphed. If I could see the future like this at the casino, I'd be a rich man.<br/><br/>Only in the United States could someone become trapped by regulations for such a long time without someone saying, ""wait a minute -- the rules weren't meant to do THIS."" (The fact that many people believe this movie is based on a true story is testament to the sometimes amazing incredulousness of US Customs & Immigration.)<br/><br/>Only in the United States could so many powerful, talented people get together and make this much of a bore out of this much potential."

","Loosely based on a true story of a Middle Easterner stranded in Paris, THE TERMINAL is Steven Spielberg's latest film, and he manages to pull off something of a miracle--a series of comical moments integrating themselves into a good story.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who was superb in previous Spielberg films SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is once again sterling in his role of Victor Navorski, a native of the fictional East European country of Krakozhia who finds himself totally stranded at New York's JFK Airport when his country falls victim to a political coup.  The airport's homeland security chief (Stanley Tucci) can't get him on a flight back; and because the U.S. government doesn't recognize Krakozhia's current (if temporary) regime, Tucci can't even allow Hanks to take one step out of the airport's International Arrivals Terminal.  Thus, Hanks sets up ""home"" at Gate 67 and subsequently makes life for Tucci and his security guards a living, comical hell, with his constant misunderstandings of American culture and political protocol, making friends with some of the airport's behind-the-scenes people, and attracting the eye of a romantically confused flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones).<br/><br/>Spielberg's ability to get laughs from this film's situation far exceeds the below-average attempt he made twenty-five years ago with ""1941.""  Yes, there are some slapstick moments, but they are better integrated into the story and are not the ENTIRE story, as they had been in ""1941.""  Hanks and Spielberg, who have become our era's equivalent of James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock, are of course matchless, and Zeta-Jones isn't too bad herself. Tucci makes for a very solid kind of heavy, and THE TERMINAL also pokes political holes at what constitutes ""Homeland Security"" in the post-9/11 world we find ourselves living in now.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for its quirky style, THE TERMINAL is yet another reason to treasure Spielberg as a cinematic American treasure."

This is a movie that one can easily pick apart for any number of reasons, all argued persuasively on this site...everything from the annoying product placements or integrations, hokey story lines, underdeveloped characters, changes in tone and character motivations ...Looking back on the movie, it is far from perfect, and yet....<br/><br/>As I watched it, The Terminal earned a certain good will, and I did willfully suspend my disbelief for it.  I give Tom Hanks much of the credit for this  (Who else could've pulled this off?  Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, I don't know) because if you don't like his character and if you can't see the movie through his eyes, this movie will go nowhere (no pun intended on his Victor's plight).  The other acting was fine: I happen to think CZ-Jones is very talented and not only beautiful, and she did fine with what she had to work with.  The almost romance btwn her and Hanks is just okay.  The support from Tucci and the rest is on the whole. very strong.<br/><br/>A couple more observations:  To me, the comedy worked so much better in this movie than the gravity.  I thought that the scene where Victor is called in to calm down a passenger is heavy-handed, the 'quickie-marriage was a bad end to a decent story line, and Gupta's surrender was also too shrill a moment<br/><br/>But having said all that, if I rated it element by element, it may get a 6/10 at best ...but as I watched it, it was an ""8"", for Hanks, for his support and for a few great laughs!

","Definitely one of Spielberg's lesser efforts, one that might play at the 2 AM slot on TCM when he dies. One wonders why he took this project; it seems more like something Robert Zemeckis might knock off. There are a couple of moments of such amazingly poor writing that you wonder if Spielberg, or even Tom Hanks, even read that page of the script. However, most of the film is a decent human comedy. A man from a made-up Eastern European country lands at JFK airport and finds out that his government has been overthrown. His passport and visa are unacceptable, and no one knows what to do with him. The head of the airport (Stanley Tucci) orders him to wait in the airport while they figure something out, only they never do. Hanks becomes a permanent resident there, becomes friends with most of the little people who work in the airport, and even courts a pretty flight attendant whom he runs into now and then (Catherine Zeta-Jones). It's all pretty fun, and even at times quite romantic (there's also a subplot where Hanks helps a young food delivery man win the heart of a woman on the airport security staff that is kind of sweet). I also like the way the film celebrates the melting pot that makes up America. It's a nice picture in a time of ever-rising insularity. Yet there are so many bits holding the film back. The screenplay really needed some editing. Hanks carries around a peanut jar through the whole movie. We are told fairly early that it does not contain peanuts, and so the audience knows that a big surprise is coming. When we actually find out, it's quite lame, and, metaphorically, this part of the film just doesn't work. And, strangely, there's this one character who works a lot towards bringing the movie down a peg or two. The character of Gupta seems to ruin the movie. His backstory is melodramatic and not fit for this story, he's a paranoid, sadistic jerk (he is the janitor, and he washes the floors just so people will slip on them), and he provides the movie with the silliest deus ex machina imaginable. That's not to mention the actor, Kumar Pallana, is a horrible actor. This film is actually inspired by the true story of an Iranian man who became stranded at a Parisian airport after his briefcase, which contained his passport and everything he owned, was stolen. The original story is much more interesting than The Terminal. A movie has already been made in France about it, but it hasn't been seen much outside of that country. I think the real story would make a great film. 7/10."

On his way to the US, a war breaks out in his homeland. The US custom department would not allow him to enter American soil. He is forced to stay in the JFK's international transit lounge till the war comes to an end. He finds a job. He makes new friends. Plays as matchmaker. Helps a Stranger.

","I'm a Steven Spielberg fan. His movies always have some sort of annoying staple to them: they almost all involve annoying precocious kids, they all have a happy ending, and they all go on for too long. But I respect him, and I think he's a very talented director. And now it seems like this guy can do no wrong. He's in the works for Indiana Jones 4 and Jurassic Park IV, and he came off of the hugely entertaining Catch Me If You Can to go onto The Terminal, a light, enjoyable, and surprisingly funny movie that is Tom Hanks' best role since Forrest Gump or before. Add Kumar Pallana (Pagoda from The Royal Tenenbaums) and Catherine Zeta-Jones in an underdeveloped role, and you've got all of the makings for a good movie.<br/><br/>Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is an immigrant from the fictional country of Krakozhia whose country, once he lands at JFK, erupts in a civil war and a military coup. His passport is now invalid and he's not allowed to leave the airport without it. Therefore, he has to live at the airport until he can leave. Barely speaking a word of English, Viktor slowly becomes adapted to living at Gate 67 and meeting many of the people who work there, including flight attendant Amelia (Zeta-Jones). Meanwhile, airport bureaucrat Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) does everything he can to make Viktor someone else's problem.<br/><br/>The airport that was created for this film is, I believe, the largest working set ever created for a movie. And I tell ya, I would love to be stuck in an airport like that. With product placement everywhere and a flight departure/arrival board that seems about 40 years too old, it does seem great. Seriously, though, making a set like that and making it all work is amazing. Making use of it to its fullest potential is even more amazing. It seems like The Terminal has everything-a great set, cinematography, acting, script, directing. I've already talked about the set. Let me go into the others.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski is really great. Almost all of the shots are done indoors (on the aforementioned set), and many of the shots are sweeping ones done inside. Everything's so precise and very beautiful to look at. Hanks, as an Easter European immigrant, does an amazing job. He actually does seem to be this person, and convinced me. His mannerisms, language, and accent are all perfect. It's either his best work or second to Forrest Gump. The script by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson is great, also. It's very funny, much funnier than I expected. Zeta-Jones' character doesn't have much to do, but her mediocre work is balanced with Hanks' amazing work. The script has the right amount of pathos and comedy, a coherent, flowing sense to it, and, well, is just overall great. And lastly, Spielberg's direction. He seems to show some restraint here, and doesn't go for his usuals I mentioned earlier as much. There's no children, but there's a happy ending and a bit could have been taken out. The ending was just kind of there. Nothing that exciting. But The Terminal is a surprising movie-one that almost needs to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for brief language and drug references."

","Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have a good track record when they team up. Not that each does not have a good record of his own, but putting the two talents together has, twice in the past resulted in success. Their latest effort, The Terminal, although a strong production, lacks something the other two possessed. It is reminiscing of Catch Me If You Can. Both feature a main character that plays the mouse just a little smarter than the cat. In Catch Me If You Can, the cat and mouse comparison is more obvious whereas in The Terminal, the cat in not trying to catch the mouse, he's trying to get rid of him. <br/><br/>This time around Hanks is playing the mouse instead of the cat. He's a man who has become a citizen of no country during his time in the air and therefore, is forced to wait out his homeland's problems in JFK airport. Although the movie is based on true story, Spielberg and his crew have decided to leave all actual details out of their telling. The country Hanks' character, Victor Navorski, was from is fictional and whereas the man the story is based on resided in the airport for 15 years, we don't know whether or not Hanks waits out the problems for weeks, months or years.<br/><br/>
Still, the story is not dependant on small details as is more a study of the survival of a man in a most unnatural habitat, waiting to go home. How long can you live on saltines and condiments (aka free food)? Where do you sleep? What do you do all day in an airport? The screenplay takes liberties in addressing these questions (there just happens to be a whole gate under construction for the entire duration of his stay), and if the screenplay had fallen into wrong hands, The Terminal would have been terminated. There are still moments when the film skids along the lines of disaster but usually the colorful cast brings it back to safe ground. <br/><br/>Actually, the characters are the most believable aspect of the film. Most likely it's because they are all well acted. Hanks plays the entirety of his character arc seamlessly combining elements of the lost boy form Big, the father from Sleepless in Seattle and the resourcefulness of Forrest in Forrest Gump. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the brunet version of a blond, but it's not her fault. The male screenwriters cast her as the damsel who's in distress about life. The cast is completed by Stanley Tucci, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana and Zoe Salana, each taking on a unique part that round out the character study of that makes up Victor's friends.<br/><br/>
The movie is neither a drama nor a comedy. It effectively mixes the two and creates a touching, unique film about what we do for love. ***/*****"

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film about friendships, relationships, and everything in between.  Tom Hanks plays (rather convincingly) Viktor Naborski, a man from a made-up country who comes to the United States for a special reason. While flying to New York, a coup was launched in his country and now he's stuck in the international terminal in the J.F.K airport with no country and no way out until the problems in his country clear up. <br/><br/>
He eventually meets some friends along the way, including a security agent, a janitor, a couple of INS officers, and a gofer in love with one of his fellow employees.  <br/><br/>The film is 85% squeaky clean and good fun.  I was so disappointed at one of the sub-plots at the end of the film (the relationship between Ameila and Viktor).  I walked out of the film with a smile on my face and it was the first time in a month that a movie has provoked me to do so. <br/><br/>

","The Magic of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks comes to life in ""The Terminal"" a seamlessly filmed story of Viktor Navorski, a man with ""no country, and No real identity (or so it seems)"". The story unfolds in a very lifelike replica of JFK or any one of today's airports across the country. Victor finds himself stranded in The Terminal after his country's government has been taken over by a violent coup. <br/><br/>As time evolves, and Victor is not allowed to leave the terminal, he finds his way thru the day to day life of living in an airport terminal , and trying to make ends meet. He has no money, no way to contact anybody from his home country (try using a 10.00 prepaid phone card to call Krakozhia!)... Soon, to the chagrin of the security department at the airport, Victor is working, living and interacting with the the people who earn their living on the day today workings of the Terminal. This all sounds very commonplace as I describe this, but what is truly amazing is the story that is told just beneath the surface of this wonderful movie. <br/><br/>This is partly a story of loyalty. Loyalty to good things, and to bad things, and what the consequences of them are. In the end, what is good, and true will come through no matter what the obstacles are. Truth prevails, patience wins, and a dream has a birth place...In, The Terminal.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie full of laughter, humor, humility and some unabashedly shameful moments as we see people, mostly Americans at their best and worst. There are moments of tears, joy, and laughter. My husband and I saw this together, and the men of the audience truly enjoyed the movie as my husband did. This isn't just a ""chick flick"" it's a movie for anyone who has ever had a dream, or made a promise and vowed to see that thru no matter what. <br/><br/>Enjoy Tom Hanks in another heart warming performance that will have you completely believing that Victor Navorski truly exists! Tom never lets us down! Saying that, I believe that Catherine-Zeta Jones was wasted in this movie..her role seemed superficial at best, and misplaced and out of sync with the entire pace of the movie at worst. She just doesn't seem to fit. I felt her performance lacked emotional impact in many ways..she just didn't seem to portray the character of someone struggling with the inner demons that are supposedly waging war within her heart and mind. I just didn't buy it....It could have been the writing for her script..something was just off with her character and performance. Fortunately, Tom Hanks can hold any scene and better yet, will anchor any scene all on his own, and will save the day as always, and in that fact, the impact of her performance doesn't cause as much of a problem as it would have if Tom had not been Viktor Navorski. <br/><br/>Well, enough has been said, and I will leave you by saying that this movie is definitely worth the money that you spend to see it, and will be a great addition to your DVD collection when it comes out!! Enjoy the movie, and enjoy Tom and Steve on one of their lighter projects!!<br/><br/>PJ Clearwater FL"

","SPOILER***********SPOILER**************SPOILER<br/><br/>Terminal is the story of a son's pledge to his father. Victor Navorski [Tom Hanks] deplanes at Kennedy Airport from his Eastern European home of Krakozia with a suitcase and a Planters Peanut can. He finds that---while in transit---his government has been overthrown and his passport is invalid.<br/><br/>Officer Frank Dixon [Stanley Tucci] explains to Victor that he's only temporarily trapped in US Immigration hell. Frank gives Victor a fist full of food vouchers, a pager so he can be reached, and turns him loose in the airport 'transit lounge', a giant shopping center with a food court. A man without a country, Victor speaks no English, has no money or friends, and doesn't understand the 'system'; but he's far from stupid. Hours pass into days and weeks, and Victor sets up housekeeping at Gate 67, an unused part of the terminal under renovation. He sets about learning English, gets a job and creates a support group---always keeping an eye on the Planters Peanut can. Victor befriends an emotionally vulnerable stewardess [Catherine Zeta-Jones] and an airport romance blooms. Can Victor outlast the system, see the Big Apple and make his Dad's dream come true?<br/><br/>Terminal is innovative, engaging, entertaining and has a highly unlikely storyline for a mass marketed film. This movie---playing to large audiences---is a joy to watch and exhibits the heart and spirit of a smart independent film dressed in Hollywood clothing. I say this even after being put on notice by a friend regarding minor technical inconsistencies. These can be overlooked if you're willing to believe an immigrant can live in Kennedy Airport. Two features make this movie sparkle and a joy to watch. First is Victor Navorski, a guy you've just got to love, who exhibits the immigrant motivation, ingenuity and desire that make our country great. Second is the supporting cast. Immigration Officer Dixon [Tucci] is a work-a-day guy just trying to stay out of trouble long enough to inherit his boss' job; he sees Victor as a threat. Zeta-Jones [as Amelia] constrains her star power and instead creates a superb cameo role as a stewardess with a cover girl persona and shattered romantic relationships; Victor is a soft shoulder. Kumar Pallanatucci [Gupta the lounge janitor] is a paranoid immigrant who sees CIA agents in the shadows and only talks to strangers after they make an appointment. Chi McBride [from TV's Boston Public] is a baggage handler who knows how to enjoy his work. <br/><br/>Terminal is another Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg collaboration and looks to be as good as their earlier efforts; remember Catch Me If You Can [2002] and Saving Private Ryan [1998]. The story is cleverly cast as a comedy, not as a tragedy; and, the supporting characters are incredibly real and enduring. The film runs just a little over two hours, more than enough time for the plot to evolve."
"suzicue","Null","0","1","23 June 2004"," A Classic!
","Tom Hanks once again proves why he is a major player in the industry. His acting talent shines through dialogue that is sometimes non-existent due to a language barrier between Navorski and the Americans. Some of the best scenes are of Navorski dealing with his circumstances with no dialogue at all. The scene with the video surveillance camera tracking Navorski's every move by the exit doors to America was perfect. When we finally see what Navorski was creating with the tile, it is amazing. I could see this film again and again, picking up nuances with every showing. Spielberg is a master director and the Hanks/Spielberg combo is a must-see. Catherine Zeta-Jones is wonderfully understated. <br/><br/>That the majority of the movie takes place in an airport terminal is such a ploy, it could have backfired, but Spielberg and Hanks pulled it off. The supporting cast and mini-stories were solid performances; each cast member provided a backdrop for the gradual opening up of Navorski's story. How he interacts with each of them and their own problems gives an insight to how even the smallest person can change our lives. This is a great film!"
"tipplerunkus","10","0","1","23 June 2004"," Spielberg's comic masterpiece.
","Steven Spielberg has proven himself to be equally adept at at number of different genres, but comedy has been the one genre wherein success eluded him - ""1941"", his one flat-out comedy, was also his one complete artistic failure. ""Hook"" was a largely comic fantasy, but was neither entirely a comedy nor entirely successful (though it is a better film than some of it's most vocal detractors have implied). ""Catch Me If You Can"" was, before now, the closest Steven had come to comic success - but that excellent film is really as much drama as comedy.<br/><br/>While ""The Terminal"" has been marketed as a comedy-drama, this really is a true comedy, with some dramatic elements. Unfortunately, our society has been dumbed down to the point where people think comedy means ""Austin Powers"". Here, Spielberg had succeeded completely at creating another classic, and Tom Hanks creates the most endearing character he has played since ""Forrest Gump"". ""The Terminal"" is hilarious, touching, fast-moving and entertaining, and the biggest stretch Spielberg has faced since ""Schindler's List"". It is one of his most character driven works to date.<br/><br/>Sadly, we have reached an appalling mentality among many filmgoers, especially those who congregate on the internet, wherin any upbeat movie that makes you feel good is trashed, regardless of quality. Anyone of even moderate intelligence realizes that there is room for many types films, and a truly well-made ""feel good"" movie which is not shamelessly manipulative or contrived can be a great thing, which is exactly what ""The Terminal"" is, along with being the best film of the summer."

","This movie was a little sappy at times but nevertheless thoroughly enjoyable. Tom Hanks once again carried the movie on his broad shoulders. Catherine Zeta-Jones was as beautiful as ever although her role felt a bit unnecessary in the end. The rest of the cast provided some good moments. And it was just another day at the (box-)office for Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>One thing that I appreciate about this movie is that although it is classified as a comedy, it tries to be more than that. The seamlessness with which the humor and drama interplay throughout the film is what makes it somewhat unique. <br/><br/>4 out of 5."
"hillbroschemical","9","0","1","22 June 2004"," Creatively done movie, with humor and a touch of humanity
","'The Terminal' is a creative movie, providing the viewer with laughter, hope and a sense of humanity that is in all of us. With all the harsh, crass and fatalistic movies coming out of Hollywood these days this movie was light, uplifting and really funny. While it was not truly idealistic, it was based on true events that happened to someone at another time, in another country and in another airport. But really, unless movies are based on true human events or history, many of our movies are quite fictitious and leave a lot to be desired with regard to the story's plot and objective. In fact, Hollywood has been definitely gravitating towards the mighty, powerful special effects story lines and has loss the touch of human individuality the how people can reach out and connect with one another. A movie does not need to be totally realistic in order to convey this and 'The Terminal' does an excellent job of uplifting the heart and giving us pause to laugh and have hope.<br/><br/>As usual Tom Hanks does an outstanding job, taking on a role that is challenging and then mastering it. Some reviews have considered the movie without any redemptive qualities and not worth watching. Unfortunately, this is totally wrong and I trust that movie goers will see this is a film well worth watching."

","This movie is trying to go in so many directions and fails to go well in any. They honestly can't find a translator for Tom Hanks in NYC, but when they need him to translate for someone else it's going to take that translator an hour to get there. Too bad he learned to speak English for a travel guide in the time since he landed in the airport, and this other translator apparently moved to New York. Stanley Tucci probably played his part a lot nicer than the writer intended. He seems pretty likable, then he's randomly a big jerk. I did like how the Cathrine Zeta-Jones bit plays out. All of the side characters are alright, but some how the movie manages to focus on the too much, yet too little for what happens with them. A great performance by Tom Hanks. Maybe he'll get another Oscar nom. Yeah, I know this review is a little all over the place, but so is the movie it's review, so I think it's fitting."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Not sure if this is a comedy, drama or offbeat romance.  It is some parts all of the above and other parts of not much.  $pielberg takes a great story and provides us his usual glimpses of film brilliance surrounded in his always present feel-good fluff.  Hanks' character is fascinating - funny, brilliant, observant and caring.  The subject terminal could have provided so much more insight into human interaction, but instead relies on too common stereotypes.  I loved the story line of Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana, but it gets ruined by a ridiculous plot twist from an episode of ""Fantasy Island"".  Zeta-Jones' story is so pathetic, I was cringing with the dialogue almost from the first moment. How many times can she say ""stay away from me""?  It seemed limitless.  OK, enough with the wet floor jokes.  How about some more of the scenes with Hanks and Tucci - that was the meat of the story if one were to ignore the terminal possibilities.  As usual an OK film by Spielberg leaves us feeling a little empty and cheated."
"MovieBuff4245","Null","0","1","20 June 2004"," I am unacceptable
","The Terminal marks the 3rd time Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have worked together and I think this is their best effort. Basically Hanks plays an immigrant named Victor, who is on his way to New York when he is told at JFK Airport that he cannot leave the premises because his country is in a war. Victor stays in the airport and is under constant supervision by the head of security(played well by Stanley Tucci). While there, he begins living in Gate 67 and starts to speak the English language. After a while, Victor meets a flight attendant named Amelia(played well by Catherine-Zeta Jones),and they bump into each other every time she returns from a flight. As their friendship develops, they talk about Napoleon and history books that are metaphors for their own lives. Amelia reveals that she is cursed in relationships and doesn't want to hurt Victor. Victor also gets a job at the airport and befriends all the employees who were suspicious of him. Victor has a big reason for wanting to go to New York and it really is a nice one. Spielberg allows Hanks' character to develop with each and every passing minute of the film and Hanks nails it with another dynamic performance. Tucci is tailor-made for his role and Zeta-Jones does the best she can with her limited screen time. At 128 minutes, the movie tends to wear down a little and could have had 20 minutes shaved off, but the film does well regardless. The Terminal is a nice find in the summer season and is a fresh change from all the mindless,loud,popcorn flicks. 8 out of 10."

I liked this movie because not only was it hilarious, but it had it's small dose of romance and a little drama/sadness in a way, like I thought it was sad because he didn't know much English and no one would help him! But in the end, pretty much everyone ends up happily ever after, that is except the janitor dude with the mop.

The accent was cheesy at best and the script was unimaginative and predictable. Navorski was obviously supposed to come off as this lovable foreigner, but I thought Tom's performance was a bit too goofy and lacking in substance, which I never thought I'd hear myself say in relation to him. Was equally unimpressed with supporting cast. I think perhaps an unknown actor with a more convincing dialect would have been a much better fit for this particular character. Just goes to show that even the best can't come through EVERY time."

In ""The Terminal"" you expect things to make sense. You shouldn't be saying ""no way, that wouldn't happen"" to many of the details and fabric that build the background.<br/><br/>For those of you that saw the movie, where was the whole fountain thing going?<br/><br/>Catherine did what she was paid to do.

A good joke was tainted by overuse. Oh, and maybe a third --- I could see how flight attendants might be offended by some pretty strong stereotypes and over generalizations.

","I have read reviews of this movie hearing it was shallow. To me Tom Hanks and Spielberg cannot make a shallow movie! Maybe if you look at just the plot and not really watch the movie, but it can get very deep. This is about an immigrant who is stuck in a terminal and must make due with his resources. He doesn't complain about his situation but figures out ways in which to live. When he made his bed out of chairs, got money, had food, and used the shops for personal needs. It's like a Zen Master, be in the present moment and you will have everything you need when you need it. If Viktor would have complained about his position those 9 months would have been a horrible experience and he wouldn't have been able to do the things he did. <br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen the movie, go see and watch it in that sense, if you have, go and see it again and watch it from that perspective.

"JAKastner","6","0","1","19 June 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of The Terminal
","Remember a time when back in the mid-1970s when Steven Spielberg was a young inexperienced director out in the middle of the ocean with a broken down mechanical shark shooting a movie many had predicted wouldn't make a dime at the box office? Thirty years later Spielberg is laughing all the way to the bank while all his naysayers and critics grumble away in disgust and dismay. In that nearly three decade career as a director, producer and studio owner, Steven Spielberg has laid claim to some of the most celebrated feature films of all time including Close Encounter of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones series, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, and Saving Private Ryan. And if box office numbers have any say in anything it's that Spielberg hasn't slowed down just yet as both Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can, both of which were made within the same year, grossed a combined $300 million domestically. With no signs of slowing down any time soon, Spielberg is sticking less with features that once made the most business sense and more with projects that peck his interest the most, this time around with the concept of airplanes in The Terminal.<br/><br/>The story for The Terminal is actually based on the true story of Merhan Karimi Nasseri who was banished from his home country of Iran in 1977 and traveled from one European city to the next seeking refugee status only to lose his briefcase in France forcing him to remain trapped in Charles de Gaulle airport where he remains there to this day. Upon arriving one morning into JFK International Airport in New York City, Viktor Navorski discovers that his homeland of Kakosia in Eastern European has become embroiled in a military coup led by rebel forces. Since the country of Kakosia no longer exists and a military embattlement has engulfed his homeland, Viktor is refused access to the United States since the government no longer recognizes his Kakosia passport or anything related to that country and will refuse to do anything with him until the war in his country is over. Until that time, Viktor Navorski can not pass the front doors onto American soil and must live within the terminal both day and night waiting for the war to end. In the meantime, Viktor befriends numerous airport personnel who request service from him to perform separate tasks in exchange for food, money, supplies, and anything else he might want while he waits for the doors to America to open. Within a nine month timespan, Viktor Navorski discovers friendship, romance, and the true realization of the American Dream without having to leave the confinement of the airport terminal building. The story for The Terminal plays much like another Tom Hanks film, Cast Away, only this time there's a lot more dialogue  too bad there isn't much substance behind those cleverly divulged words. Unfortunately the film suffers from its own unbelievable story line in that many of the scenarios that occur within the course of its two hour time length are so over the top that it is hard to take anything from them seriously. And despite having a relatively happy ending, most of the subplots that occur within the feature wrap up too neatly which, once again, derives a bit from the film's sense of believability and realism.<br/><br/>As was said earlier, The Terminal plays like Cast Away in that Tom Hanks is the main focus of the film and that is all that truly matters when it comes to the bare bones approach for movie-goers but if you rely on more supplemental supporting characters to add to the entertainment value, you aren't going to find that here. Tom Hanks never fails to do wonders with the material that is given to him, even the rather bland and weak components presented with the character of Viktor Navorski. There are moments where you are suppose to feel sorry for this man but unfortunately he is played out so much like a running joke at times that it is hard to keep a straight face in some of the film's more serious moments. And what's worse is that that running joke becomes less humorous and more annoying as the feature goes on thus eliminating potential connection one might have with the character and the actions that occur with him on screen. One character that does not seem to work well at all is Amelia, played by Catherine-Zeta Jones, the female flight attendant Viktor falls in love with. There is a point within the film where the audience is meant to feel sorry for the character after she admits she is tired of waiting for the right man to come along in her life  then we remember she knowingly had a sexual relationship with a married man. How do you feel sorry for a person who blatantly trots around the world having promiscuous relationships openly with married men and cares only of herself and no one else? And her relationship with Viktor Navorski, in the end, becomes pointless as just when she seems 'destined' to be with him, she ends up going back to 'dating' the married man she had earlier in the film. That combined with the lost connection the audience has with the character of Viktor Navorski results in an ample void in the film's emotionally driven message.<br/><br/>Overall, the arrival of The Terminal signals not a new surge in the creativity of director Steven Spielberg but rather it announces blatantly that the world famous director may have finally been brought back down to the level of mediocre filmmakers after spending so much time at the top. The film suffers severely from a rather predictable and emotionally confused script that wraps up nearly all its loose ends but leaves its audience scratching their heads wondering how the conclusion they received came about. The hard part is deciding what The Terminal actually is, a comedy or drama  there is enough evidence to support either side, and that is its problem. It's great that Spielberg introduces some well induced humor into the rather lifeless storyline but sadly he bunches too many gags into one time period leaving the audience confused when the direction of the film takes on a more serious tone. This is not to say that jokes that used in the film don't work well, they do, it's just that there are too many of them that they end up outbalancing the film's dramatic moments thus resulting in an uneven presentation. With both Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal coming off as less then impressive, especially compared to the superb work he's most known for, this should be a wake up call to the director to get his head out of the clouds (namely off the concept of airplanes) and back to the sci-fi and fantasy genres he works best with.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)"

His character wasn't exactly my favorite, but he played the part well. You might expect the movie to be boring because it takes place in one setting, but it is the exact opposite.

The evil character in the movie is very detestable, which makes everything work. Spielberg has come up with another great movie. There were numerous laugh-out-loud moments where the entire audience was cheering, and you are left genuinely rooting for Hanks' character. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a fun two hours of entertainment."
"kismit","6","0","1","19 June 2004"," Pretty average stuff for Hanks and Spielberg
","I was having doubts about whether this film was must see in the theatre or if it could wait for the rental. I assumed incorrectly that it would be more than a smarmy romance comedy because of Spielberg's involvement. You could have plugged Billy Crystal into the Tom Hanks role and not missed a beat. Lightweight stuff. I emjoyed it a little more the Lady Killers but but I wish I had waited for the video. Just a paycheck for Hanks."
"gracie28","5","0","1","19 June 2004"," one of Hanks' more mediocre movies
","Really a small movie that must have cost a bundle to make with all the sets and people and hauling equipment around to airports.  But overall The Terminal is lacking.  It is barely better than a made for tv movie only because of the presence of Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones.  Some of the supporting actors do a good job, but overall the plot is predictible, trite and one feels the taste of saccharine creeping up about half way into the show. Spielberg wasted his time on this one.  Not highly recommended. If you thought Sleepless in Seattle was charming and stimulating, you will find The Terminal to be a weak sort of maudlin example of the genre.  There is one twist toward the end that makes the movie worthwhile, but overall the film is a major under achievement."
"spin180live","Null","0","1","17 June 2004"," Stranded again!
","Tom Hanks once again finds himself stranded in a place where survival will take ingenuity and patience. He is completely out of his element and will have to take advantage of every resource at his disposal if he is to ever see home again. Yet this time it is not an unsettled island with a mute companion, but JFK and a bevy of airport helpfuls. Due to a political uprising in his homeland, Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a man without a country, a passport and any grasp of the English language. Yet through time and determination he discerns enough to begin a life within New York's International lounge where he must stay by law. As believable and interesting as the concept alone is, the movie has to add a bad guy and a beautiful love interest to make it, well, a movie. Enter Frank (Stanley Tucci) and Amelia (Catherine Zeta Jones) (Amelia being the love interest by the way). The remaining 2 plus hours of this film has us rooting for Viktor and booing Frank. There are quite a few lol moments to keep you entertained and Tom carries the weight of this Spielburger on his dexterous shoulders quite well. So well that you can forgive the ""never could happen moments"" and the trip down cheesy lane that almost hijacks a very touching ending. Mr. Hanks has the amazing ability to take a so-so movie and give us a character that we love and want to see succeed. He truly brings substance to each role and breathes much needed spirit into this film. Which without him could have given a whole new meaning to the title, The Terminal. This romp is Rated PG-13 for brief language. But is other wise quite harmless. So go see it, you could do a lot worse. With a spin on The Terminal, I'm Matt Mungle"
"artzau","8","0","1","18 June 2004"," Funny and punny
","Spielberg and Hanks.  Toss in Tucci and the lovely Welsh lass, Zita Jones and you're on your way.  There's lots of little bits of funny business and lots of puns, both oral and visual.  The story is amusing as Tucci plays the compleat bureaucrat whose stick-to-the-book attitude holds Hanks prisoner for month after month.  The entire movie takes place in a terminal and goes from there. This movie touches on a favorite Spielberg theme, i.e., lack of communication.  Hank's Divorsky teaches himself English during the enforced tenure and everyone comes to appreciate the simple honesty of this simple man. Check it out.  We liked it."
"unbend_5440","7","0","1","18 June 2004"," Loved the airport survival stuff, but....
","The Terminal is, at the same time, one of my favourite movies that I've seen this year, and a partial disappointment. It just further proves that there has yet to be a single movie released this year without considerable flaws. I don't want this to come across like a negative review because I really did enjoy The Terminal a lot.<br/><br/>This is obviously a great premise. The movie jumps right into things with Victor being detained, Victor having communication problems as they try to inform him that he has no country, and of course, as you already know if you've seen the trailer or any TV spots, Victor is forced to stay in the airport. The scenes that played the best, the moments that I felt were the best of the movie, all happen in the first hour. All the scenes of Victor adjusting to life in the airport was enough for me. The segment with him returning the carts for quarters was the point when the movie seriously took off. All the way through his quest to find a job, the movie really had me won over. Those airport survival scenes were more than enough to hold together this movie. I wonder why The Terminal needed to introduce a love story (if you can call it that) and formulaic elements near the end. It's the introduction of these things that lost me. This was an interesting and moderately original entry in Speilberg's career before he decided that it needed a formulaic story. Stanley Tucci's character that's constantly out to get Victor, that was just typical and lame. And call me crazy, but I think this movie could have done without the love story. Very out of place, not to mention the fact that this ""love story"" never goes anywhere. There's a very unfulfilling end to it. I also don't see the point of the twist where Victor gets the temporary Visa. That idea was dropped from the movie and never used. It was a waste of time that overly-complicated things. I wasn't too crazy about the final showdown as Victor tries to leave the airport. It would've been corny even in a Frank Capra movie. That's the major problem here. Spielberg started it out as a movie based in reality, and half way through he turned it into an almost fairy tale Capra movie.<br/><br/>But, minus these complaints, like I said at the start, this was one of my favourite movies of 2004. It also enforced my belief that 2004 is a year when everything will disappoint, even on a small scale. Tom Hanks puts on a great show. He always does. Some of the supporting cast is good, but the characters are poorly handled. I liked the very last scene of the movie. I loved Janusz Kaminski's Cinematography. He's one of the only DP's that's daring enough to blind the audience with light. I really loved John Williams score, as always. The biggest praise I will give is for the scene where Victor translates for the crazy Russian. Every contribution to the execution of that scene was perfect. That was a memorable cinematic moment. I wish the last 30 minutes had that kind of delivery. I do believe that Spielberg is one of the most consistent Directors working today, and he does direct The Terminal well, however I can't help but fantasize about what this movie would have been like had Andrew Niccol handled it, like he was originally supposed to. I have a feeling Andrew Niccol would have brought a lot more originality and focus overall."
"tccandler","Null","0","1","18 June 2004"," Starts off great... ends up languishing near mediocrity.
","Steven Spielberg's 'The Terminal' begins with a nifty premise, rife with possibilities, but he allows it to drift away into the schmaltzy realm of feel-good comedy and cheesy romance. The first half of the film is often intriguing and consistently amusing in its originality. Based loosely on the true story of a man who was forced to live at the Charles de Gaulle International airport in Paris, this film works best when it focuses on the specific details of Victor Navorsky's (Hanks) day-to-day life surviving in the airport lounge. It is a fascinating predicament to have someone caught in limbo, not allowed to enter the United States and unable to return to his home country (the fictional Krakozhia) which doesn't exist anymore. But the film falls apart after it has exhausted the original premise and delves into romantic and comedic subplots which fail on virtually every level.<br/><br/>The film manages to remain barely recommendable because of a laudable performance turned in by Tom Hanks. He is fantastic as Victor Navorsky, the everyman who barely understands the language and will do anything to abide by the rules laid out by the head of airport security, Frank Dixon (Tucci). Victor is a good man who carries around a secretive can of peanuts whose contents remain a mystery for the bulk of the film. He doesn't have any money but he manages to cope by using some very ingenious methods. It is fun watching him navigate the airport, making his life as comfortable as can be given the circumstances.<br/><br/>The surrounding characters, however, are the downfall of the movie. Tucci is asked to play Dixon as a one dimensional caricature, solely obsessed with making Victor's life a living hell. There is no nuance or humanity in the role and it feels like a bad-guy character from a Jean Claude Van Damme action movie.<br/><br/>Catherine Zeta Jones plays a highly unlikable love interest for Victor. She is a flight attendant and the other woman in a love triangle with a married man. She can't seem to break away from the destructive situation. At no point did I ever really buy into Victor's emotional attraction to her. Perhaps his interest is based solely on sexual attraction, which would be understandable given Zeta Jones' legendary beauty. But if that is all there is, it is hardly worthy material for a movie romance.<br/><br/>There are other minor subplots involving some of the airport employees, including a grossly unrealistic and thinly explored romance between an INS agent and a food services driver. You won't believe a moment of that cheesy tale. There are also a number of appearances made by an Indian janitor that are meant for comic relief. The first time you see him is mildly amusing. The second time induces a minor chuckle. The 37th time you see him will make you want to stand up and throw your popcorn at the screen. Spielberg overuses this mediocre character gag beyond belief.<br/><br/>Like I said, the only time this film is successful is when Hanks dominates the action. He lifts this film from cheesy schmaltz to passable entertainment with a pleasant message. And, amazingly, he manages to do this despite the efforts of Spielberg whose typically recognizable directorial signature is completely missing from this film.<br/><br/>Spielberg goes for cutesy all too often in this movie. It is enough to make an experienced filmgoer roll his eyes and cringe. Usually, Spielberg manages to be one of the stars of his own films. 'The Terminal' feels like it could have been directed by Gary Marshall or Nora Ephron. I half expected a Meg Ryan or Kate Hudson type to come along and fall in love with Victor at the end.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad film, but it is disappointing considering the vast talent involved. Half of the film is meritorious of a B+... the other half deserves a D+. Hence, I give it my most average grade of C+ as it teeters between interesting character study and cornball romantic comedy. 'The Terminal' is best suited for television viewing rather than costly trip to the theatre. And that is something I did not ever expect to say about a Steven Spielberg film.<br/><br/>Critical Mass Movies - www.tccandler.com"
"Hmshollyt","8","0","1","16 June 2004"," Highly entertaining and very funny.
","I very much enjoyed this Capraesque film. Tom Hanks was his usual charming self, Stanley Tucci was perfect as the evil head of the airport. Catherine Zeta Jones was believable in her role as the ill-used (by her married boyfriend) airline flight attendant. She wore minimal makeup, a plain hairstyle, and boring uniform which helped. This is a very endearing, uplifting story of everyday people who happen to work at the airport. The supporting actors were all great and so were the background actors. Spielberg's use of the camera while the large cast quickly wandered through the airport created a wonderful feeling of movement. I was a little let down by the ending, but I won't give it away."

","I went to see this movie with an open mind and all I can say is that I enjoyed it very much.  Tom Hanks is excellent in his part and does a great job with the accent. Stanley Tucci gave another great performance with another different role. Although Tom and Stanley are outstanding in their roles, it is the supporting cast that really steal the picture.  Steven Spielberg did a fine job of directing, and the over two hours really flew by.  My recommendation is go see this movie if you want a few hours of entertainment with no real message"

","being that the most recent tom hanks films have not sparked my interest as much, i was delighted to hear he would be starring in this film because the story was not so ""tom hanks"". ladykillers i stayed away from, for two reasons: one, it looked dumb, and two, i have little cash to be splurging on dumb films. but this time i thought that tom hanks had gone back to his cast away days to ensure a good film that gets you thinking, and that's what it did. most people would produce a film to put hugh grant in so that it will be a romantic comedy or helen hunt to get the guys interested, but they finally learned that good ACTING gets the story right, not just the ideal body image and personality. i sat in the back of this advanced screening, laughing louder than everyone in the whole theater, and that wasn't because it wasn't funny, it's because you can hear my laughter through a hurricane. if you miss this film, you'll be missing out on a laugh that you probably haven't had for a while. viktor navorsky (tom hanks) makes you see the other side of visa's and passports as he adapts to the rather cold airport, and wins the hearts of everyone as his journey to new york is put on hold and he makes the best of this new environment. i would see it again in a heartbeat. viktor made me fall in love all over again with tom hanks, so i say thank you to him."
"rdwill657","8","0","1","14 June 2004"," Another Great Tom Hanks Job
","I was amazed at how well Tom Hanks maintained an Eastern European persona throughout the movie. How others and Victor played off each other was enjoyable to watch. However, the role played by Catherine Zeta Jones was not exceptional. For her to be in love with a married man when she can easily meet many others during her travels doesn't make sense. If the writers put more thought into her role, she would have had a great character to contrast Victors. As for Tom, some would argue that his Victor shows too much ingenuity while coping with being stuck in the airport terminal, but ask yourself, he somehow manages to go NYC from his Eastern European country and he is a skilled carpenter. I would say he didn't play Victor... he was Victor."
"JaneSchmo","7","0","1","11 June 2004"," short but accurate review of ""The Terminal""
","I saw this movie yesterday for free so I'm not complaining but yes it IS a sappy love story between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Hanks.And an unbearably whimsical,unplausible and contrived dramedy that really tested my patience.<br/><br/>What is it with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg in recent years?It seems as if they are taking a vacation from doing their usual serious and worthwhile films and turning to lightweight mainstream commercial projects.I mean,first year's ""Catch Me If You Can"" of two years ago and now this.<br/><br/>Apparently,there really was and still is a man stuck in Charles de Gaulle airport.Read the article written last year in the NY Times if you want to find out about it because this is the sentimentalized,bare bones of the original story,love interest thrown in Hollywood version.<br/><br/>Victor Navorski is a tourist from Krakozhia coming to NYC for a reason not revealed until the end.(Throwback to the time films,especially the Marx brothers ones used to invent countries so not to offend anyone)The government in his country is overthrown while he is inflight and as the U.S doesn't recognize the new one,he has a passport from nowhere and can neither step on American soil or go back(is this possible?)He is ordered to stay inside the JFK terminal and one of the frustrating things about this movie is that he could actually leave anytime he wanted to.I mean,even the obligatory bureaucrat running security for the airport(Stanley Tucci)just wants Victor to run away,solving everyone's problem.<br/><br/>In short,the premise doesn't hold water.And yes,he meets a beautiful but troubled flight attendant.And yes,the airport staff is assembled of colorful ethnic funny characters(paranoid Indian janitor,love-struck Mexican,black family ma,tough young black female security officer,sympathetic cops,etc.)And yes,the mean man ruining everyone's fun is ultimately defied and left screeching at the cameras as Victor marches out,followed by a cheering crowd.<br/><br/>There is one good reason to see this movie,though,and one reason why I'm ultimately giving it a thumbs up:Tom Hanks.I'm a giant fan,always have been and this is one of his best performances.Some people may complain that he is once again playing his usual Everyman character or question the authenticity of his portrayal. As a person with Slavic immigrant parents,I can attest that there are men exactly like this in the world.Hanks hits all the right notes as an alien in a strange country who doesn't know English and has to communicate with body language.He captures all the mannerisms and quirks of a Victor Navorski.What a great actor."

","I saw a sneak preview of The Terminal and I was surprisingly shocked on how well it was done.<br/><br/>NO SPOILERS<br/><br/>From the get go, the movie shines in everyway possible. Right off the bat we get into Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) character. The way the movie progresses is unbelievably perfect. **The Terminal** gives offers fun and comedy for the whole family to enjoy.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of Finding Nemo. The way out there is a world underneath the ocean matches the way there is a world in this airport. Viktor Navorski goes through a lot of phases and emotions throughout the movie which makes this film stand out. Tom Hanks portrays Viktor Navorski in a brilliant manner. The emotions he shows from start to end makes you feel good and bad. Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) played a good role, although I didn't know what to think of her at times. She was a mystery character throughout the movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) played a great villain/enemy type character. I loved how he did everything in his power to prevent Viktor Navorski from leaving the terminal.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies written. What the characters go through, discovers, finds, shows, loves, and does are mixed into one great film. Steven Spielberg did an outstanding job on directing what could be one of the best films of the year, if not, thee best. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's this original and unique. You can go into detail Viktor Navorski learns the US ways, and he quickly adapts to its system.<br/><br/>The Terminal is a movie that'll shock you. It turned out to be a great film. From the acting to the story, this film has it all. See this fun flick with anyone and they will enjoy it. The Terminal offers great laughs, a great story, and an overall great experience.<br/><br/>Story: A+<br/><br/>Acting: A+<br/><br/>Visuals: N/A<br/><br/>Cinematography: A<br/><br/>Overall: A"
"sjmcollins-1","Null","0","1","6 July 2004"," Way too cutesy
","(Some spoilers) I can't remember the last time I rolled my eyes more watching a movie than I did watching The Terminal, basically a 21st century remake of the 1981 Gary Coleman masterpiece, On The Right Track.  We are to believe that not speaking English gives Victor Navorski a childlike innocence/perfection that surpasses all other fish-out-of-water characters, save the incomparable E.T.  Hanks leads a nauseatingly saccharine group, that includes, most offensively, Catherine Zeta-Jones as slutty flight attendant Amelia Warren, and Kumar Pallana as Gupta Rajan, the Indian janitor with the endless one-liners.  Gupta's idea of fun is to wet the floor then sit two feet away and laugh loudly as people slide and break bones.  His character is boorish and stupid almost to the point of offensiveness.  Zeta-Jones does nothing for the good name of flight attendants world-wide, as she alternates between sleeping with married men and trying to pick up Victor every time she comes in contact with him.  Her character is really left out in the lurch as the movie ends, as she seems to be in the same rut as when we first met her.  Hanks' character, of course, goes from total outcast to having every last man, woman, and teenager working at the airport gazing upon him with complete rapture.  There are numerous silly subplots, including a completely unbelieveable Star Trek type romance, and we are led to believe that no one working at the airport has any friends, family, life, etc. outside of the walls.  They're basically in Victor's shoes as well.  Sounds unbelieveable?  Spielberg didn't think so."
"Road Dog","Null","0","1","3 June 2004"," Bring the family to this light-hearted romp *Spoilers*
","***Hanks, Patric, Troyer sparkle in light-hearted romp***<br/><br/>The terminal is a racially diverse, musically charged, accessible comedy, one the whole family can enjoy!<br/><br/>I found that the multi ethnic ensemble cast provided the most rewarding moments in this film. While Hanks is always capable, the many cameos (Ming-na, Ice T, Vern Troyer) added an extra level of flavor. While I would have expected more action from a film ghostwritten by John Mctiernan, I was nonetheless pleased. One question: were the iguana and the elephant really necessary to magnify the film's comedic climax? I think Hanks' sword fight/virtuoso ballad sung from the terminal's Starbucks could have worked without the inclusion of diverse wildlife. But I'm not one to question the writing of the man who gave us Die Hard and Predator (albeit from the director's chair). <br/><br/>Aside from the many musical interludes, my favorite thing about the film was Jason Patric as Hanks' comic foil. I had never seen Patric attempt anything close to this, nor was I aware he was even in the film(esp. since he isn't listed high up in the film credits) but his many comedy drenched scenes (particularly the one involving the rodeo poster and the soapy sponge) had me rolling the aisles. I'm sure I won't be alone in wishing Patric a long and successful crossover comedic career a.l.a. Leslie Nielsen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is film all audiences will enjoy. I certainly did!"
