","Having watched the film (more than once)i must say that i think that the person who wrote the comment ""A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie"" is being silghtly childish. You cannot watch a film like Van Helsing with out taking it with a pinch of salt - it is a movie with vampires, werewolves and the frankenstine monster in at all at once for goodness sake. So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn't matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit ""off"" in places. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to any one who likes action/fantasy films and is up for a bit of fun!"
"Axel-9","7","173","239","21 November 2004"," Silly, lacking in plot, but good fun
","It's big, it's dumb, it's cheesy as hell, but I found it to be enormous fun. This was made to be a roller-coaster ride and by that token it should be judged.<br/><br/>Actually after the opening pastiche of the Boris Karloff Frankenstein movie, I thought this had the potential to be a 5 star movie. It was very atmospheric and had me hooked. However the film never really captures any sense of magic from there onwards.<br/><br/>The main body of the movie does go on a bit, and it could have done with some attempt to create engaging characters. Plot and story are not always necessary for fun movies, but you do need characters with a level of interest to capture the mind, otherwise you tend to find yourself not giving a s**t. I felt Van Helsing did verge into this territory, but for the most part it's so fast paced this doesn't matter so much. The points where it does try to introduce plot are the moments where it really does fail. In fact there is too much going on that is never really explained, and I think it would've been better not to have bothered at all, than use the nonsense Sommers resorts too. For example the attempts at backstory to Van Helsing. Better to have one of those interlude chatty scenes you have in the Indy films, where it establishes he's a dude, rather than the poor attempts at angst and pathos. Really bad was the moment he gets upset over Frankie's Monster. What the hell was that all about?<br/><br/>Hmm maybe I took that a bit seriously, but the movie knows what it is, why try be something else. I also thought that that masked ball sequence was a natural conclusion, the eventual finale at the castle felt like an add on, which lacked any real punch.<br/><br/>Far better was Van's introduction to Transylvania, with the benefit of some neat angles and panning shots, the crossbow battle with the brides was cool. The coach chase was exciting without being exhilarating, but kept the flow going, so it's a shame some more bad plot gets thrown in, especially when it was involving the underwritten Velkan. That's the film's main problem - overkill of characters, with little space given to any of them to evolve.<br/><br/>Finally a word on the CGI. I thought it was very good, especially the morphs that were used. The very first moment Drac starts to turn made me jump a touch, and when the vampires turns into their fanged, contorted state it looked pretty scary to me. The wolfman transformation, with the ripping flesh looked genuinely painful. At this point I was thinking the CGI was genuinely stunning. I'd have preferred the finale if it had just been Van vs Drac though, having CGI characters fight felt uninvolving, and Drac in snarly state was far better than the beast he turns into.<br/><br/>This is a movie to genuinely switch of the brain and enjoy. At times there's too much going on and perhaps a bit too much swinging about for my liking, but it's an adrenaline filled ride. I'd probably give it 7 out of 10."
"Bastard Out of Carolina","6","243","345","11 January 2005"," It's Just Camp
","I'm really baffled at the hateful negative response to this film. No it's not Oscar material, it's just good campy fun. If you're a fan of old monster movies, James Bond and Indiana Jones flicks, and over-the-top humor in an action/horror movie, then you get it. I guess if you're looking for a summer action flick that takes itself too seriously, then you're out of luck with this one.<br/><br/>I admit that the film runs a little to long, the chemistry between Beckinsale and Jackman leaves something to be desired, and the Frankenstein ""monster"" (though well-intentioned to give a nod to ""Young Frankenstein"") is really annoying. But the entertainment spawning from the hokey fun that ""Van Helsing"" is all about, makes these flaws so forgivable.<br/><br/>For me, I'll take the over-acting screaming Brides of Dracula, the silly homages to dozens of classic action and horror movies, the cheesy one-liners, and the not-so-convincing special effects. Isn't that what monster movies are all about?"
"BrandtSponseller","10","315","453","11 March 2005"," Double-O Van Helsing, Superhero
","First a word of warning. There are a number of people who would be best advised to avoid Van Helsing. If you dislike cgi, if you're a purist, if you're looking for something ""realistic"", or if you're looking for a slower-moving, understated film that's a deep character study, you'll more than likely hate this film.<br/><br/>Set around the turn of the 20th Century, Van Helsing features the titular hero (Hugh Jackman) taking a break from his usual ""monster slayer"" activities, which are commissioned by the Catholic Church, to pursue a grand plot initiated by Dracula (Richard Roxburg) involving the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley), the Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and the two last surviving members of a Transylvanian family that has long been battling the vampire.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is a fast-paced, computer graphics-laden horror/adventure/fantasy film wherein Universal re-imagines its core stable of classic horror characters. I actually like cgi, I'm not a purist, I love the genres--I'm not looking for realism, and I love fast-paced action-oriented thrill rides as much if not more than I love character studies.<br/><br/>As for the character remakes, Van Helsing becomes a slick retro-Matrix-styled macho action hero, part James Bond/007, part Indiana Jones, part Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a secret Catholic Church order filling in for the Watcher's Council and the Bond ""Q Branch"" combined. Dracula becomes a suave, scheming, mad scientist who looks like a romance novel hero. Frankenstein's Monster becomes much closer to Mary Shelley's depiction of an intelligent, loquacious, tormented, slapdash victim of a misguided doctor. And the Wolf Man, when wolf, becomes a cgi generated over-sized, super-agile, hyperactive beast. That should already turn off all of the purists.<br/><br/>The look of the film is lush, with lots of unusual point of view shots, exotic locations and computer-generated environments. CGI is used extensively for the human characters in the film as well as the monsters--it's frequently employed to enable physics defying stunts and amazing, far-ranging ""computer camera"" transitions. Van Helsing provides a good argument for such extensive digital assistance, as many of the visuals would be simply impossible to achieve through any other means and substituting some of the creatures with mechanicals, animatronics, special effects makeup and the like would have caused the film to go far over its already outrageous estimated budget of 160 million.<br/><br/>The plot, while not deep on characterization, couldn't be more full of events and action. Combined with the extravagant visuals and quickly changing, sprawling locations, the result is epic in scope. Director/writer Stephen Sommers, who was also responsible for remaking the image of another classic Universal character in The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001) (probably the reason the Mummy is not present in here), begins Van Helsing in a black and white scene that wonderfully recreates the feel of the James Whale-lensed Frankenstein films, including referencing a number of shots, scenes and characters from those classics.<br/><br/>After the titles, we move into a color-filled world ala The Wizard of Oz while we're treated to a brief character-establishing scene of Van Helsing battling Mr. Hyde in the bell tower of Notre Dame. Sommers then quickly whisks us away to the Vatican, where Van Helsing receives his orders.<br/><br/>This whirlwind beginning can be almost overwhelming--it certainly is visually--and it takes a moment to get up to speed and catch our breath, but once we settle into the town square of Transylvania, we're enraptured by the story and the pacing reaches a more sustainable level. Although fantastical at heart, the performances from the principle cast members help anchor the film in ""reality"". Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Roxburgh, Henley and David Wenham all turn in nuanced performances that imply the depth of character that the film does not have the time to fully explore.<br/><br/>The intense action throughout the film combined with the cgi and spectacular sweeping camera moves often gives Van Helsing a feel somewhere between a comic book film and a video game. That fact might turn some viewers off, but as innovative, suspenseful, exciting filmic art, this is years ahead of most other recent releases. In fact, the sophisticated technological wizardry and entrancing epic storytelling is somewhat reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings films, which makes me wonder just what other viewers see in those to enable them to consistently sit high on the IMDb Top 250 list while Van Helsing struggles to attain a slightly above average rating. Perhaps Van Helsing deserves a more tempered first or second viewing from those who have summarily dismissed it due to unjustified expectations/preconceptions. This really is an outstanding film that at least deserves to be appreciated on a technical level, and should be easy enough to enjoy for its action-oriented storytelling prowess as well."

","Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Were it not for these two gifted performers, this movie would be beyond silly. As it is, the plot is almost pretextual for the special effects.<br/><br/>The Eye Candy factor is high, though. Hugh Jackman as the tortured hero, filmed in the dark all of the time, makes us weak in the knees. Kate Beckinsale does magnificent physical feats while squeezed into a corset.<br/><br/>The story: Van Helsing (Jackman) is essentially a bounty hunter of supernatural monsters, a job he took on at the request of the church as apparent penitence for sins he cannot even remember. As a reward for his centuries of service, he hopes to make his way to Heaven instead of Hell.<br/><br/>Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is the last survivor of a family of Transylvanian vampire hunters. Her brother has become a werewolf and she is conflicted about whether he should live or die.<br/><br/>Naturally Anna and Van Helsing team up to rid Transylvania of the evil vampire overlord. Van Helsing has a tool kit Batman would envy, and Anna maintains an arsenal of monster-killing weapons that would make a survivalist proud. Between the two of them, the monsters don't stand a chance.<br/><br/>Put your mind on hold, suspend disbelief and intolerance for the occasional leap of reason, enjoy a slightly randy friar (Van Helsing's sidekick), and go along for the ride. Van Helsing is a great Sunday afternoon video."
"MaximumMadness","10","153","222","26 June 2005"," Silly, Fun Adventure
","Many, many people have seen ""Van Helsing"" and said it is trash, a waste of time, etc, etc. But what they don't understand is that sometimes, with so much happening in the world, people need to let it all go so they can get some thrills from movies.<br/><br/>The plot of Van Helsing is somewhere between simple and complex. The back story is that Count Dracula and his three brides have given birth to countless offspring throughout the hundreds of years they've been living as vampires. They themselves were created from the living, but their children were not. They were born of the undead, and have never had the chance to come to life... or the afterlife vampires live. They simply are dead.<br/><br/>Then, Dracula comes upon a mad scientist named Dr. Frankenstein, whom wants to discover the secret of creating life. He helps the doctor in his sort-of admirable task of creating life, hoping to use his creation to bring life to his children. But it is not to be. As the film opens, Dr. Frankenstein is killed by Dracula, who no longer needs him, and his monster, whom Dracula needs to give the essence of life to his children, appears to perish in a fire.<br/><br/>A year later, Gabriel Van Helsing, a tortured man without a past is sent to Transylvania by the ""Holy Order""... An organization of all of the religions of the world. With the assistance of a trusty sidekick, the still living monster of Frankenstein and a beautiful young woman, he must hunt down and destroy Dracula before he can give life to his thousands of children.<br/><br/>The reason I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 is that is never seems to get the recognition it deserves. It has great action, great actors, and a great story. (At least for a summer film) It's not the type of movie to be taken seriously, it's the type to sit down with some friends, have some popcorn, and get ready for a silly, scary, fun ride. I love it!. 9/10"
"rdatsun","8","126","182","5 January 2005"," It may have been corny, it may have have overused its CGI. But, hell, I loved it anyway!
","Yeah, I know this isn't a masterpiece of cinema and I can already tell half this nation's populace hates it despite a good run at the box office last summer. But still I went into this movie just looking for a good time (that and am a huge fan of old school monster films) and thats what I got. For the uptight and so called expert critics, let me spell it out for you: ITS A POPCORN MOVIE! OF COURSE EVERYTHING GOING TO BLOWN UP TO THE MAX AND GO OVER THE TOP! IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS, THEN DON'T CLAIM YOU DO AND BASH A FILM BECAUSE OF IT! *Ahem* alright on to my review.<br/><br/>Plot: Helsing and his assistant, a frair named Carl, are sent to Translvaynia to protect the last of a gypsy family from being stuck in purgatory due to a curse Dracula put on them. In the process however Helsing must also stop Drac's plan of engulfing the world in darkness all the while battling his minions. Throw in a plot device involving Frankenstein's monster and you have a pretty cool adventure brewing.<br/><br/>I'll admit for a movie that suppose to be about Helsing. They kinda dropped the ball on the story. There's way too much emphasis on the gypsy girl rather him and they don't flesh out his back story about his lost memory and his supposed history with Dracula. Also the movie has a few nonsense parts (the talk with the creepy undertaker) which kinda slows down the film a bit. But still the movie stays on a linear path and the set-ups up to confrontations are well done. Not to mention the confrontation themselves even if some are a little silly (ballroom scene (though a good homage to the Fearless Vampire Killers), the fight with the last bride, Igor and Dracula himself). Yes their CGI laden but I don't care, its a supernatural movie after all. So what better way to do them.<br/><br/>The actors seem very comfortable with their roles and looks to be having a great time. Extra props go out to the dude who played Frankenstien's monster, I was really feeling for him. Easily one of the best characters in the movie.<br/><br/>Add to that some excellent backdrops and clothes to which the film really draws you into its 19th century world. Yes the movie is full of flaws but it only for fun and only wants to entertain to which it success in spades. If you don't like it, well fine. But for all who love a good popcorn flick or a fan of old school monsters, you can look no further. Van Helsing is just the ticket for a simple good time."
"PeachRT","10","169","259","9 December 2005"," People sometimes miss the point
","I personally love this kind of tongue-in-cheek, change of the usual film. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was that, as was Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. If people looked at them more as just visually entertaining with a bunch of sharp one-liners, and tried to stop making them the next big action movie, or trying to read a life change message somewhere in there, they'd have more fun! I loved the real mix of actors appearing in this movie - I was straight to IMDb after watching it to see if I was right or wrong about who played who. I especially liked the straight-in beginning - no credit break to kill the run of the film. The black-and-white beginning, going to colour soon after, was not new, but echoed nicely with the old Hollywood movies that the start was echoing. Altogether, a great fun watch. But that's just me!"
"James-280","8","159","253","7 May 2004"," Rip roaring homage to classics
","This is a very ""Stephen Sommers"" film, were you not to know it is the same director as the Mummy you would guess it within 20 minutes. However it should be pointed out that this is not a bad thing at all. The movie is a rip roaring adventure with some wonderful camp humour and great special effects. The plot consists of Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) being part of a special order of the Vatican to kill all unhuman / evil creatures, so amazingly he is sent of to Transylvania where he is to kill Dracula, the sub plot being that Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) is the last in the line of a family who's mission for centuries has been to kill Dracula themselves. If Anna dies before Dracula, being the last in the line will condemn the whole family to eternal damnation.<br/><br/>While the plot isn't the strongest in the world, it actually doesn't make any difference as the special effects and incredible pace of the film doesn't really give you much chance to contemplate any deeper meanings or plotlines.<br/><br/>The poster campaign has featured heavily on this film containing Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's monster, though there are other wonderful classic characters which make the film an even bigger joy to watch for example Igor and Dr Jekyll with the former character becoming a wonderful stereotype of the hunchbacked laboratory assistant.<br/><br/>Strangely, the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale doesn't have the same spark or passion as Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in the Mummy saga, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the two characters are not the typical leading man and lady who will obviously fall in love, which again gives this film quite a refreshing edge.<br/><br/>David Wenham as Carl, a friar sent to look after Van Helsing gives the comedy edge with wonderful one liners and a constant cheeky glint in his eye.<br/><br/>The monsters themselves are a perfect homage to Hammer Horror / Boris Karloff films although I personally found Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) a little bit too camp and less evil although his character was certainly a more evil Dracula than has been seen recently. His 3 brides are possible the surprise highlight of the film turning from beautiful women to gargoyle-like creatures in a split second are a joy to watch in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>The wolfman metamorphosis is (as has been reported) an incredible piece of special effects, with the victim tearing off his skin to reveal fur and vice versa throughout the change. But the important thing here is the word victim! Stephen Sommers has kept very close to the original stories portraying the wolfman as a helpless victim ""it's not his fault, he can't help it"" and this is no truer than in the excellent portrayal of Frankensteins Monster (Shuler Hensley) who as written by Mary Shelley is not an evil creature out for destruction, but more a lost soul out simply to be able to exist.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be that some of the CGI effects take over. While Sommers has obviously learnt from the travesty that was the CGI Scorpion King, there are times when characters are swinging from walls and ropes that you feel you are watching an animation rather than a live film. However, because these effects are also extremely well done, it is more of a criticism on the viewer who has obviously been spoilt with such effects recently.<br/><br/>The pastiges of this film are truly a joy, with references to James Bond (in a highly enjoyable scene about selecting weapons), X-men, Matrix, Aliens, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Rocky Horror and countless other more obvious Horror classics.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (finally deserving his first lead role) is incredible and this role shows what a fantastic (and without doubt one of Hollywoods hunkiest) actors he is. This is truly his film and deservedly so, not that he ever wasn't in my eyes, but this film has now made him one of the industries hottest property!<br/><br/>This is an adventure of a film which all ages will enjoy and I highly recommend it, there isn't time to find fault as the pace will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."
"Leofwine_draca","4","5","5","26 November 2016"," Less a tribute to Universal horror, more a mindless CGI mess
","Stephen Sommers goes for broke with this big-budget monster mash, filmed in exactly the same vein as his MUMMY remake and just as disappointing. Things begin quite promisingly with a homage to the Universal classics of the 1930s but rapidly descend into inanity, as one hurried action sequence follows another with no logic, reason or plot to be seen at any point. The film is noisy, special effect-filled and totally lacking in characterisation or story, as superhero Van Helsing (renamed Gabriel – did they not have the rights to the character or something?) battles not only Dracula but werewolves and Frankenstein's Monster too (incorrectly called Frankenstein in one scene).<br/><br/>The movie lasts for an astonishing two hours without offering anything new at all – you really will have seen everything that's on offer here. There are blatant rip-offs throughout and a lack of common sense on the part of the director that is really annoying – you can just picture him saying ""let's have that woman fall off the roof and jump down a tree! cool!"" Hugh Jackman is pretty wooden as the hero, but who can blame him given the material, whilst Kate Beckinsale does ridiculous rather well. Richard Roxburgh, an actor who I really liked in MOULIN ROUGE, is similarly awful as camp goth-vamp Dracula, whilst David Wenham, gives the best performance as the comic relief. The special effects are wicked, as you would expect given the budget – those werewolf transformations are particularly good – although the flying female vampires look a little too CGI for my liking. Sadly, the said effects don't save what is essentially a dog of a film."
"DannyJane","Null","134","223","9 May 2004"," Van Helsing - Homages R Us
","If you're a purist-any kind of purist-stay away from Van Helsing. But if you love the Universal horror films of the 30's and 40's or the Hammer films of the 50's and 60's and don't mind re-imagining them, then go. Check your brain at the door, buy a large popcorn and a soda and sit back for a fun ride.<br/><br/>The film is a complete reworking of everything you think you know about all the big guys. Present for your enjoyment are Dracula, the Wolf man, Frankenstein's monster and a guest appearance by Mr. Hyde. And of course, tying the whole thing together is our hero, Van Helsing (yummily played by Hugh Jackman). Named Abraham in Stoker's book but called Gabriel in the film, VH doesn't appear in any book other than Dracula, but in the more than a century since his `birth' we've become accustomed to his presence as the elder statesman of monster killers.<br/><br/>Completely re-imagined in this new production, VH is now young, handsome, and virile and apparently as immortal and indestructible as the creatures he chases. Don't expect great resolutions or deep explanations here, there are none. Don't expect Academy Award level acting, some of the actors apparently phoned in their performances while others decided to take up the slack. The resultant scenery chewing is uneven, but never boring. The dialogue, not to put too fine a point on it, is absurd and sometimes unintentionally, howlingly funny.<br/><br/>The makers of this film are clearly fans of the genre. The subject matter is treated with a loving sledgehammer. As the film progressed my companion and I made a game of naming all the classics represented. In addition to those you might expect, we were able to recognize allusions to `Young Frankenstein,' `Star Wars,' `Aliens,' `Raiders of the Lost Ark,' `Gremlins,' `Romancing the Stone,' `Lord of the Rings,' `Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' `Twister,' ""Wild, Wild West"" and any James Bond film you care to name among others. If you go, try it yourself.<br/><br/>If the producers were intending to frighten us, they failed dismally; but if they only intended to entertain us they succeeded, if not brilliantly, at least admirably. I'm uncertain if they intended quite so much humor, but both my companion and I laughed out loud most of the way through.<br/><br/>In addition to inside jokes, the film is filled with extraordinary visual images. From the opening encounter between VH and a startlingly oversized and athletic Edward Hyde, physicality is the order of the day. Everyone, including Van Helsing's friar sidekick is a magnificent specimen. Even Frankenstein's monster (who I nicknamed `Sparky' for the electrical discharges from his partially exposed brain) is hideously beautiful. Also, the cinematography is breathtaking. Both real scenery and CGI imagined are dazzling. I especially loved the castles Dracula and Frankenstein. Both edifices were Mad Ludwig's Neuschwanstein Castle as imagined by Tim Burton. I'd almost say that if the film had no other virtues at all, it would still be worth the price of admission for the incredible beauty of its backgrounds. However, the real star of the film is the (you guessed it) special effects.<br/><br/>Transformation scenes abound. At any point in the film you are only moments from watching someone turn into something. And what wonderful things they are. Vampires don't become simple bats, but snake-jawed, full size harpies. The Wolf man sprouts saber tooth fangs as he rips the human skin from his body. Frankenstein's monster's flesh partially peels from his skull and is smoothly pushed back into place and Mr. Hyde morphs from grinning giant menace to pitiful human corpse.<br/><br/>Not to put too fine a point on it, everyone-vampires, villagers, heroes, even horses and cattle go airborne sometime during the film. Dracula's three brides take the prize for most hang time. These ladies would be a wonderful asset to the Transylvanian Air Force with their dizzying dives, spins and barrel rolls. The camera gives us a bat's eye view of their deadly aerobatic ballet. When not in full flight Dracula and his wives walk up walls, across ceilings and carry on family quarrels while hanging from the rafters by their toes. Those characters that do not fly on their own power are lifted aloft and usually dropped soon after. The rest are climbers, scrambling up and down castle architecture like houseflies on speed. Interestingly, no one is ever seriously hurt or even has a hairstyle mussed.<br/><br/>The scenes shift so rapidly that it becomes difficult at times to follow the story. Fortunately, the gossamer plot is as deep as a kiddie's backyard swimming pool, so it isn't too much of a problem. Only the barest bones are needed to carry us from one action sequence to the next. Although there is no nudity and not a cussword is uttered, the film is violent. Well, of course it's violent--and about as traumatic as a Road Runner cartoon. Still, it earns its PG-13 rating. Leave the little 'uns home. The throbbing, pounding soundtrack keeps the attention even when not very much is happening.<br/><br/>Is Van Helsing a great film? No. Absolutely not. Is it a good film? No, not really. Is it entertaining? Yes. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough."
"AlsExGal","3","22","31","25 May 2019"," One of the worst movies made by a major Hollywood studio I have ever seen...
","... and I qualify that because of course there are worse films out there, but they were often made by poverty row studios with no budget. Universal Studios is not poverty row.<br/><br/>Why did I give it three stars? Because effects and cinematography have to count for something, and that this film has in spades. But in the plot and direction departments, this thing is one ugly mess. Van Helsing is the legendary vampire hunter, often ably played by Peter Cushing over at Hammer studios back in the 50s and 60s. Here you have another fine actor, underrated Hugh Jackman, playing Van Helsing, but you'd never get that by what goes on here.<br/><br/>So Universal drags out every legendary horror character in their catalog - not just Dracula, who actually IS a vampire. They manage to incorporate the Frankenstein monster and The Werewolf too. Bring in the mummy, the invisible man, and the creature from the black lagoon and the gang would all be here. There really is no plot to speak of, just lots of flying female vamps so you can get some gratuitous nudity in, and then there is a plot line installed to lampoon Jackman's role as Wolverine over at Marvel.<br/><br/>The bottom line - there must be something better you can do with your time. If not, then you need either a hobby or a job."

Luckily for Mr. Jackman that he has the XMen franchise to live off of and lucky for Kate Beckinsale that she is a hottie because neither of these two have offered much of anything else in any of their other movies and offer even less in this one(what is up with that accent Kate?). Van Helsing makes quick work of getting its characters into situations where they look cool and say cool things. Unfortunately they end up not looking so cool and saying things that are irritating. Its as if the characters know they are in a movie and know that they can't be stopped because the script says so!<br/><br/>I'll finish off with this last thing. I subject myself to all kinds of movies. I enjoy great, timeless dramas as much as do dumb summer fair so its not as if i'm a pretentious film student who can't turn off the brain and enjoy some eye candy. There is room for all kinds of films in my mind and neither is more or less important. Anywho, I DO NOT walk out of a movie for any reason, not even to pee. I'm there, i'm giving two hours of my time for the movie. This is my philosophy and for 20 plus years of movie watching i've NEVER once walked out. For Van Helsing i not only took a trip to the bathroom but i went for a cigarette too! I could care less about what was happening which is a sign that not one character was interesting. Not one character seemed genuine nor interesting. So welcome in the summer crop of Hollywood crap with open arms and blank stares, its going to be one long summer movie season!"
"isabelle1955","Null","33","61","1 December 2005"," Not camp enough unfortunately
","I've seen some comments on this film suggesting that it has been misunderstood because, really, it's just a camp, cult film. The problem I have with it, is that if that was the intention, it fails because it's just not camp enough, and if that wasn't the intention, it fails because it's dire. Camp dire is fine. Just plain dire isn't. If I was Bram Stoker, I'd be suing from beyond the grave.<br/><br/>Now I loved director Stephen Sommers ""Mummy"" movies, especially the first one, which was lots of fun, I really like fine actors Hugh Jackman, Richard Roxburgh (wonderfully camp in Moulin Rouge) and David Wenham and I was fairly open minded about Kate Beckinsale as I'd hardly seen her in anything before, so I sat down to watch this movie (on pay per view at home) perfectly willing to be entertained. I rarely watch a movie about which I can find nothing good to say, but this was one of those rarities. From the incoherent script, to the confused plot, to the ear splitting sound track, to the overuse and abuse of CGI, to the tacky Brides of Frankenstein (or whatever those girlies were supposed to be. When it comes to scantily clad women, erotic is good, tacky isn't), to Kate Beckinsale's silly costume, to the revolting peasants, the entire thing was such a mess. I think it just proves again that the quality of a movie bears little relation to how much money you throw at it, and that there is really no substitute for a decent script.<br/><br/>I'm not averse to special effects movies. Try and imagine films like, say, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, or Star Trek: First Contact or last year's War of the Worlds, without special effects. Doesn't really work, does it? And those are all movies I loved, because the effects are used to enhance the story, to tell it better. But what you have at the core of those films, is a good exciting story, well written, and with characters you care about.<br/><br/>Who cares about any of these guys? Van Helsing fails mostly because it substitutes special effects for character and story, and then tries to take itself seriously. It's quite a cynical film, hoping to find an audience dumb enough to lap it up.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to imagine what good actors like Jackman and Wenham were doing in this? Maybe it was one of those movies that's much more fun to make than to watch, I'm sure they had a blast in Prague, or where ever it was, and earned enough to pay the mortgage for a few months. I'm also well aware that as a middle aged woman I'm probably not the target audience for Van Helsing. So it really only remains to say that I sat down to watch it with my two teenage kids, one of each sex. They hated it too, and gave up watching long before I did. When a movie is so bad that my teenage son would rather do his homework than watch - that's bad!"
"WriterDave","2","41","78","22 October 2005"," Jane Austen's ""Destroy All Monsters!""
","This film is a brilliant and psychologically complex treatise on Victorian era social mores as seen through the eyes of Van Helsing, a rapscallion character who overcomes his impoverished beginnings to climb the social ladder and eventually reach the pinnacle of high society. It's his cockeyed optimism that allows him to go from rags to riches with an almost Dickensian charm, but in classic irony normally suited for Shakespearan tragedy it is also that very trait the leads him on a path to danger and horror. There's also brilliant social satire as seen through the colorful characters from Transylvania, who bring both shock and scathing black humor in their representation of the nomadic, exotic outsiders than so many proper Victorians feared would infiltrate and poison their gilded society.<br/><br/>Just kidding, of course. ""Van Helsing"" is wall to wall special effects and hammy acting dancing across poorly lit set designs. Classic movie buffs are turned off in the first few minutes with the over-the-top alleged ""homage"" to the black and white Universal horror flicks. The plot is arbitrary and pointless, though with so much going on and Kate Beckinsale in tight corsets, I suppose this does have some entertainment value for ten year-old boys. I watched this one rainy Saturday afternoon and left twice to clean my bathroom and mop my kitchen floor, and I didn't miss a thing."
"FilmOtaku","1","26","47","10 May 2004"," Unbelievably awful
","-Spoilers-<br/><br/>Where do I begin?  Besides currently entertaining a class-action suit to sue for my time back, I'm compelled to paraphrase Homer Simpson and just write `Screw Sommers' for the next twelve lines, but I suppose I need to try to put into words why I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire LIFE.  <br/><br/>It wasn't the fact that the CGI (with some slight exceptions of the work on Dr. Jekyll  but only slight and fleeting) was terrible.  It wasn't the fact that there was a plethora of plot holes and loose ends (even allowing for a franchise).  Nor could it simply be explained by the fact that the story progressed as quickly as your average daytime soap opera.  (You mean that they are STILL at the same party and I missed six months of the show?)  This movie was horrible because it tried to be something it just absolutely couldn't  a coherent, action-oriented popcorn flick.  I was aghast within the first three or four minutes, and quickly felt like Malcolm McDowell in `A Clockwork Orange' being forced to watch horrible imagery on the screen. I tried my damndest, but I couldn't even take the opportunity for a two hour nap because this film was like a bad accident  you want to look away, every fiber of your being is telling you to look away, but you just can't because you are so astonished at how horrible the display before you is.  I can't remember exactly when, because I think my body went into shock halfway through as a defense mechanism, but I was so appalled by the corniness and sheer awfulness of a particular scene, that I actually turned to a complete stranger next to me who was alone and completely slouched down with a look on his face like he had not only just run over his dog, but was forced to do it again, and said, `Okay, seriously?!' and garnered a sympathetic eye roll in return.  <br/><br/>-Definite Spoilers Ahead-<br/><br/>I'm not even going to comment on the acting because there WAS no acting, except that Kate Beckinsale had an accent which ranged from Count Chocula to something completely indistinguishable, and made for some pretty hilarious viewing. Oh wait, I wasn't supposed to laugh at that  I was supposed to laugh at Igor walking around muttering under his breath how it's always, `Do THIS Igor, do THAT Igor.'  I also don't think I was supposed to be laughing when Beckinsale was telling people to run inside to protect themselves from Dracula's brides, yet she and everyone else ran circles around the town square for about five minutes  I was supposed to find the fact that the Friar, when asked by a townsperson what she could do to make up for him saving her life, ends up calling in his favor by sleeping with her.  (Not after reminding us for the 100th time that he's not yet a monk he's a FRIAR.)  And I certainly don't think I was supposed to laugh at the Frankenstein Popsicle (why the hell was Frankenstein in the film in the first place, and secondly, why was he frozen in a block of ice?!)  I was supposed to be worried that these jokers were going to get out of Dracula's Castle alive.  Unfortunately the only thing I was worried about was whether or not I could control myself long enough to sit through this piece of garbage without trying to sabotage the film and end the misery.  The fate of Kate Beckinsale was promising for about a tenth of a second, until Sommers apparently not only decided to attempt to channel the 30's monster films, but The Lion King as well.  The touching and tender moment which was probably supposed to illicit emotion definitely created a reaction in me  something akin to a stomach flu or acid reflux.  <br/><br/>I've never seen `The Mummy' or `The Mummy Returns', so I can't compare it to his other work, but Van Helsing makes Stephen Sommers look worse than an amateur  he comes across as an amateur who thinks he knows what he's doing. In reality, what he's doing is ruining the promising career of good actors, Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxborough.  Rich.Hugh, seriously  leave this potential franchise and run towards the light.  Based on the ridiculous presentation of this film, the next one will have Van Helsing getting stuck in a cage match between the Easter Bunny and Snoopy  and we'll be encouraged to find it awe-inspiring because it will be from `The Director of The Mummy!' I can see the trailer now:  `Odie.  Peppermint Patty.  The Wicked Witch of the West.  All fear one man.' And hopefully we won't then be seeing Hugh Jackman look up from under his hat this time, but Corey Feldman.  <br/><br/>This `film' will do nothing but waste your time.  If there was a grade lower than a `1' on the IMDB voting list, I would classify it as that instead of reluctantly giving it a positive number.  I wouldn't wish this thing on my worst enemy  I can't muster up enough hate to inflict this tripe. It wasn't long before I was jealous of the vampires' victims, because I wanted to be put out of my misery as easily. Van Helsing is nothing but a huge disappointment, and will only drain any strength of will or intelligence from you.  When the film ended, I was left completely defeated and struck dumb.  Drop the popcorn and slowly step away from the movie.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

I won't even get started on the incredible amount of errors in this movie. The writer/director might have well smack the viewer across the face with some of the mistakes they let slide. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed in this movie after looking forward to seeing it for some time. I can only hope that we will not see a sequal to this mistake. Or at least get a new writer and director who can actually do this good idea justice."
"Li-1","Null","38","73","10 May 2004"," There's some fun to be had, but most of it's buried in this mess.
","* 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes of Van Helsing are promising: a black-and-white prologue depicting mad scientist Frankenstein and his monstrous creation is a nice little homage to the Universal Pictures of past times. It's nicely juxtaposed with the movie's opening action sequence, an exhilarating battle between the titular Van Helsing and the evil Mr. Hyde (a silly special effect, but used well in this opening scene), with plenty of over-the-top stunts that are thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>But most of the rest of the film is a complete and utter mess, so much that I wouldn't be surprised if the movie saw an afterlife as a cult classic of sorts. Truth be told, I sort of admire the movie's outrageousness and I honestly can't bring myself to totally hate it, but I sure as hell can't say I liked it, either.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman stars as Van Helsing, the Vatican Church's assassin of evil creatures. A clumsy monologue between Van Helsing and one of the priests serves as exposition, though you would think this conversation is one they would have had a long time ago (yeah, I understand it's to bring the audience up to speed but there are less idiotic ways of doing it). We're also introduced to a secret hideout under the Church with an arsenal of weaponry and inventions.<br/><br/>Van Helsing's latest assignment is to head to Transylvania and help the remaining Valerious family (pretty much just Kate Beckinsale) kill the vampire Dracula, who if not vanquished, will somehow prevent the Valerious clan from entering Heaven. Van Helsing's also got another incentive for going: there's an insignia on a paper from Transylvania that looks a lot like the symbol on his ring. You see, he has no memory of his past, except lots of nightmares involving ancient wars he couldn't possibly have been part of (this, too, is clumsily introduced and is something that one would think he would have mentioned long ago). For this mission, Van Helsing brings along friar Carl (David Wenham), a milquetoast inventor but nonetheless faithful companion. Along with Anna (Beckinsale), they set out to end Dracula's reign of terror before he can finish with a plan that could bring to life thousands of his offspring.<br/><br/>Beckinsale's introductory scene is also pretty cool (and also very silly), with lots of slow-mo, as she helps her brother fight off a Dracula-controlled werewolf. It's also a decent action sequence in its own right. Soon afterward, Van Helsing's arrival leads to yet another battle scene, this time between the Anna's townspeople and Dracula's sexy brides. This, too, is another passably enjoyable sequence, if also a little overdrawn.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, most of the action scenes in this movie are passably competent, but not much more. I did like the coach chase, and I enjoyed almost every scene involving flying vampires (so long as they're not of the baby bat variety). But after a while, it's just overkill, particularly the insane climax, where we actually witness Frankenstein swinging around on rope and accidentally knocking over not one but two villains who are about to kill our heroes on two separate occasions. The baby vampires are also ridiculously lame, and a possibly exciting action sequence set inside an elaborate masquerade conveniently ends very quickly with the use of a ""grenade"" (think Blade II).<br/><br/>The performances are about what I expected, overdone but fitting. Matter of fact, despite some initially annoying turns catching me off-guard (David Wenham's Carl, for instance), most of the leads actually kind of grew on me after a while. That said, Jackman is a tad bland, surprising when you consider what a charismatic actor he normally is. The gorgeous Beckinsale is fine in her role, even if her cringe-inducing accent isn't. Wenham scores some laughs as Carl, none more effective than a scene where after he's saved a hot chick who asks how she can repay him, he answers with a ""naughty"" request. Richard Roxburgh is quite amusing as Dracula, hamming it up in every possible moment and proving quite enjoyable to watch. Kevin J. O'Connor also delivers a few good laughs as Igor, I especially loved his response to why he keeps torturing the werewolf.<br/><br/>But there's only so much fun performances can do to keep such a poorly crafted and written film afloat. Lots of questions go unanswered; why would Frankenstein the monster show any feelings for his master when you consider the fact he never even speaks to him (the movie opens with the scientist proclaiming ""it's alive!"", then is killed by Drac less than five minutes later, hardly enough time for Frank and the monster to bond)? Why has the Vatican waited so long to send Van Helsing to kill Dracula when considering he's presumably had many assignments beforehand? Why does Van Helsing bring along Carl for this mission? Why does that creepy, white-haired Transylvanian guy stay out in the middle of night when there are vampires and werewolves lurking about? How exactly does Dracula maintain control over his werewolves and why exactly does he even need them? Why is the werewolf antidote confined in such an elaborate manner when it proves to be something Dracula would hypothetically need to take hold of in quick fashion?<br/><br/>A few of these questions might actually have been answered but with all the indecipherable accents and loud score and soundtrack, I couldn't tell you. The foley guys must have had a field day cranking up every sound threefold, and Alan Silvestri's overwrought score has this distracting tex-mex style twang in the background. The story, in general, is convoluted, but put together with so little coherency that every time an action sequence pops up, its random appearance is more disjointed than thrilling.<br/><br/>The CGI is extremely overwhelming, but instead of creating a visually atmospheric and engulfing environment, it's a goofy example of extreme overload. F/X shots are inserted with little care to their effectiveness, and the film is packed with obvious and annoying CGI stunts. It's actually almost as bad as LXG in this regard, but is at least not nearly as bloated (from a running time POV) and visually plain as Pirates of the Caribbean (which gave us little more than underused CGI skeletons and a lot of plain-looking islands and warships).<br/><br/>The movie's super-cheesy final scenes lead me to wonder if Sommers was on crack when he included those last few f/x shots. I hate to say it, but he's now almost on the same level of George Lucas when it comes to pasting together plot, action, and special effects. Hard to believe this is the same guy who gave us the terrifically entertaining The Mummy, but with every successive film, he's actually going further and further away from what made his first blockbuster such a joy"

","If you're a fan of Gothic stories, this movie is just what the doctor ordered. Nearly every conceivable horror creature created for the silver screen is resurrected for this masterpiece. Mary Shelley's Frankenstine born in 1818, Bram Stoker's Dracula penned in 1897, the fable Lycanthrope, Wolfman and even Robert Louis Stevenson's duel identities of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are part of this magnificent and horrifying menagerie. The story also includes Dracula's Black Transylvanian castle, the pathetic hunchback assistant Igor and an army of throat-ripping, flying children of the night. But just to round-out the story the famed vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing takes center stage to this nightmarish saga. The film is called "" Van Helsing "" and is a living tribute to all the horror stories of the 1930's 40 and 50's. What this movie offers is a collection of those dark tales and nightmares we thought we'd forgotten in our youth. Not so, with the incredible special effects this film uses, those black dreams return and are more terrifying than ever. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, with Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula. Kevin J. O'Connor is Igor and surprisingly Alun Armstrong plays Cardinal Jinette. Samuel West is Dr. Victor Frankenstein with Robbie Coltrane and Stephen Fisher both playing Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. For those seeking eye candy there is Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran as Marishka. From start to finish, there is so much action, drama and savage physical confrontation it's nearly impossible to turn away. What puzzles me is the main characters' constantly fall from dizzying heights to crash against everything from thick wooden beams to concrete and stone barriers of all kinds and yet few bones are ever broken. Still, the excitement and enjoyment from this movie are incredible, so much so, it's no wonder it immediately became a Classic. Superb! ****"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","8","12","6 May 2004"," The name's Helsing, Van Helsing
","Spoilers <br/><br/>After the black-and-white prologue (which is quite well done), the movie follows the usual 007 formula: the hero is introduced through an irrelevant opening adventure, goes back to headquarters to get instructions for the next project and collects state-of-the-art hardware from `M'. The difference is that this  `M' is a young man who doubles up as the hero's sidekick.<br/><br/>I do not think that a flick of this genre needs a high-quality plot. Such a coherent, integrated plot as seen in Underworld is a rare exception. While Van Helsing's script is not exactly Oscar caliber, it serves its purpose, particularly when it has to string together vampire, werewolf, Frankenstein's monster and other such niceties. <br/><br/>The four principals in this movie all have their attractions. Through X-men, Hugh Jackman has established himself firmly as directors' top pick for this genre, and plays here a strikingly similar role, someone with a lost memory and a tendency to turn wolfish. Similarly Kate Beckinsale, whose transformation from the bewitchingly charming Sara Thomas in Serendipity to the beautiful but deadly vampire Selene in Underworld came as a mild shock, seems to have found a home in this genre. Here, while still aristocratic as in Underworld, Beckinsale does not shun from the earthly elements, getting thrown about and battered in action scenes every five minutes, and uttering quips like `I'll clip off something' when suggested by Van Helsing to clip off one of evil servant Igor's fingers. None of the dainty, gentle charm in Serendipity. But still ravishingly beautiful.<br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh nothing short of being perfect for the role of Count Dracula. He looks a little like the inimitable Peter Cushing who, however, was the vampire-killer rather than a vampire in the best version of Dracula (1958). Both actors however make an admirable Sherlock Holmes. Only through browsing the IMDB message boards did I come to realize that David Wenham (Faramir in Return of the King) is so popular (and deservedly so). Here, he plays Carl, Van Helsing's sidekick, a semi-comical role absolutely different from Faramir, giving us an opportunity to see the talent of this actor.<br/><br/>Cast aside, it all boils down to special effects and action. One comment gives a lengthy list of all the movies Van Helsing reminds the audience of. The only thought I would add is that the army of flying monsters (`children' of the Count), in addition to looking uncannily like the Gremlins, also reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West' army of flying monkeys.<br/><br/>Many people do not like the ending. I think it is a commercial decision, to strategically place the movie in the best position for a sequel."

","Hugh Jackman trades his razor sharp claws for razor sharp blades to play the monster-hunter, Gabriel Van Helsing, hired by the church to go to Transylvania to take on Count Dracula {Richard Roxburgh}, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster.<br/><br/>The premise sounds very interesting and this film had potential to be a good summer blockbuster. Unfortunately, the film is very uneven. The CGI is great and the movie gets an ""A"" on that part but the rest of the film was handled very poorly. Apparently, Stephen Sommers took some lessons from George Lucas and decided to fill his movie with just CGI. This isn't a bad thing since it is a summer movie. However, the film becomes very dull and the story is kind of weak. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept but the execution just wasn't very good. Sure, the monsters looked great but I was expecting a little more than that.<br/><br/>The acting was okay, nothing special. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing well and he does make for a good hero. Kate Beckinsale was weak and very cheesy as Anna. I know the movie is supposed to be cheesy but she was a little too much. Her chemistry with Jackman was also non existent and this hurt the film. Richard Roxburgh gives the best performance out of everyone. He plays Dracula and he is very effective as the villain.<br/><br/>A big problem with Van Helsing is the length of the movie. 132 minutes is just too long and it made the film very dull to sit through. The film was also too cheesy for me. Some of it was just so stupid and the story grew more and more ridiculous as the film continued. The first hour is actually pretty good and entertaining. The second hour is dull and not as creative as the first part. The ending was alright, nothing really special. Honestly, the main reason to watch this film is because of the combination of Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein in one movie. The story is weak, the acting is nothing special and the direction is poor. The film is very stylish though so the 160 million went to good use. Besides for these flaws, Van Helsing was still a decent summer blockbuster with some fun moments. In the end, now that it's out on video, Van Helsing is worth a look just don't expect too much from it. Rating 6/10"

Everything ties together nicely. The technology in the movie was tastefully used. There was a lot of action, and the story never slows down. It's very upbeat. When it's not thrilling, it's hilarious. This movie was amazing. It is worth seeing again and again."

","Most movies are made for people to let their imagination roam free, this is one of the movie where you can enjoy watching by doing just that ! I think the action is great and the special effects top notch, who cares if there are loop holes in the story or its not realistic , after all its not a drama or a true to life story. Van Helsing have all the action, adventure, horror, comedy and fun you can ask for in a movie. Hugh and Kate did a great job of bringing the story to life. So my advise to all is go see this movie , sit back and relax and let your imagination roam free for the 2 hours ! I would rate this movie 8.5 out of 10."

Why would I? It is sold as a Vampire Horror flick. It wasn't called Carry On Van Helsing was it? <br/><br/>So what do we get? A totally unscary Vampire movie that looks like it had piles of money thrown at it when what it needed was sense and a decent script. Richard Roxburgh's ""pantomime"" Dracula is dreadful. The CGI stuff is totally unconvincing. ""Mr Hyde"", for example, changes in size in relation to Van Helsing every time they share a shot. In fact the whole movie is like a badly drawn cartoon."

","Criminally underrated movie. Sure, the acting is cheesy and gives Hugh Jackman Another vehicle to chew out his hammy lines, but that fits nicely into this package of cgi and fast paced story telling. The plot is simple....stop Dracula from creating an army of undead using a mixture of old school characters mixed with more modern team approach. Obstacles along the way include a myriad of universal monster tropes. Beyond that I recommend viewing as i wont spoil the fun! The cgi may be over used to some but it is high quality and creates some truly amazing set pieces and monster transformations. Costumes are rich and quite frankly I'm surprised this hasn't garnered viewing parties a la harry potter or the Rocky Horror picture show. This movie truly feels like an adventure with fleshed out backstories before the main theme ensues. A perfect one and done!"

","With the possible exception of the current occupant of the White House, few things have provoked more sharply divided opinions than this movie. People either slobber over it or throw up on it. The first time I ever tried to watch it (on some cable network or other) I turned it off in the middle of the big scene where the female vampires attack, stoutly averring that there was no way to get drunk enough to watch the rest of it without slipping into a coma. Since then, I have come round to the opinion that this movie really does sort of grow on you. (Yes, I know, so do skin tags, warts and carbuncles.) That's why I'm actually giving it five out of ten stars. Yes, that's right, I said five out of ten. Consider: <br/><br/>1. Who would have believed that Universal's long-delayed sequel to ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" could have made the original film look like a polished work of art by comparison? <br/><br/>2. What other movie can you think of, in which the Frankenstein monster is actually the most sensitive, intelligent character? <br/><br/>3. Where else can you hear so many different people all trying to imitate Bela Lugosi, without any of them even coming close? <br/><br/>4. What other movie had its script written by 50 monkeys who were really trying to reproduce the complete text of Hamlet by accident? <br/><br/>5. Where else can you see a heroine get so relentlessly bashed, smashed and slammed around, walking away from all of it with no more ill effects than Wile E. Coyote, only to be killed in the end by a relatively minor collision with a CG werewolf? (Presumably all those massive internal injuries finally caught up with her.) <br/><br/>6. Well, most people don't like physics anyway, do they? <br/><br/>I could go on endlessly with such niggling observations, but the point is, let's give Stephen Sommers credit where credit is due. He had a much bigger budget than Ed Wood could have ever dreamt of, and yet he still managed to make an even more ridiculous movie than ""Plan 9."" You can't learn that in a physics class. Even more importantly, maybe someday there might be a next generation of MST3K. Can you imagine what a good time they could have with this one?

All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in ""dark-o-vision""...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here.

","Hugh Jackman could have spared himself the trouble of trying to act among an otherwise cardboard cast and settings that fit the special effects - it all looks as tasteless as is barely acceptable in something like a Hulk-sequel. The script is mainly an inconsistent sequence of clichés from various, unrelated and hardly compatible horror traditions, turning the eponymous vampire-killer into a universal monster-slayer trained by a secret Catholic order as an orphan, with some other implausible twists. The genre normally requires accepting a few unrealistic premises, but here there is almost nothing beyond that to make it worthwhile. The result is rather infantile, hardly good enough even to be mentioned in the history of Dracula-movies."

","Within 5 minutes of the opening, I knew I'd made a mistake by entering the theatre. After 20 minutes, I began to think that the box office should issue cyanide capsules along with your ticket to this show. It's not much of a horror show, but it is a nightmare ordeal to experience.<br/><br/>There isn't much of a story or character development. There's barely an effort to create any sense of time and place. The dialogue and action is laughably insipid. There is never any sense of peril or suspense, because almost everything is obviously pasted together on a Mac. (NOTE TO DIRECTORS: If I can see that the hero is fighting a CGI monster on top of a CGI Notre Dame, rather than a monster with some physical presence on a set that resembles a real cathedral, what's so thrilling about that? Where is the sense of real danger? If I see a runaway stagecoach driving down a CGI path heading for a CGI canyon, what's supposed to make me care?) Even the costumes are out of place: Jackman is dressed like the mysterious, brooding hero of a postmodern Western, and Beckinsale in her bodice and lycra pants appears to have been pulled from a Meat Loaf video.<br/><br/>All that's here is Wolverine from the X-Men fighting some CGI versions of famous monsters, presented with a relentless assault of loud noise (in Surround Sound!), going through the paces of various ridiculous and implausible scenarios. I had to sit through it until the end because I was with a group, but I actually slipped out for 5 minutes in the middle just so I could get a break. Towards the end, I started to feel like I wanted to cry. Seriously. Like another reviewer said, I felt like Alex in A Clockwork Orange being forced to watch such horrible images until I broke. As I walked out after the show, I wanted to ask the concessions people if they could sell me back the last two hours of my life.<br/><br/>It was one of the worst movie-going experiences of my entire life.

","In 1887, Van Helsing is in Paris chasing Mr. Hyde. After eliminating him, Van Helsing goes to Rome, where he receives a new assignment from the Vatican: to help Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp), the last members of a catholic family, to fight against Dracula. With the company of the monk Carl (David Wenham), they go to Transilvania, where they fight, together with Anna and Frankenstein, against Dracula, his three brides and a werewolf. This movie is a spectacular adventure. I participated of a promotion in a Brazilian cable television (Telecine) and I won the tickets for the `avant-premiere' of this film on 05 May 2004, in one of the last movie theaters in Rio de Janeiro not located in malls, but on the street (Cine Palácio). With a huge screen, excellent sound system and high headroom, these factors highlighted the wonderful gothic photography of this film, which in some parts recalls the German expressionism. The beginning of the story in black and white is very impressive, and I dare to say that it is a great homage to the monsters of Universal studio. The state-of-art special effects are amazing. I have not recognized Kate Beckinsale in her role of Anna: she is strong, wearing curled long hair and believe me, more beautiful than usual. The story is funny, full of action, therefore it is a must-see film.  When I watch, for example, an Ingmar Bergman's movie or an art film, I expect a message of life, something to think about. When I see movies like `Pirates of the Caribbean', `Kill Bill', `Indiana Jones', `The Mummy', `The Lord of the Ring', `Harry Potter', `Spider Man' etc., I expect a great adventure. And what is Van Helsing's proposal? A breathless action movie, having lots of humor (the gay style of Dracula, most of the scenes with Carl, the English accent of Dracula and his three brides, Mr. Hyde looking like Hulk etc.), a romance between Van Helsing and Anna, special effects where sometimes we are not able to identify what is real or not, a great homage to famous monsters, therefore, it is excellent for its proposal of entertainment. I still bet that it will be included in the IMDB Top 250 list pretty soon. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `Van Helsing, O Caçador de Monstros' (`Van Helsing, The Hunter of Monsters')"

",". . . I just came back from the theater and have to say I really really enjoyed watching this film. How I judge whether or not a film is suitable to my taste is generally speaking, limited to subject matter and how I feel during the actual act of watching it. Obviously I am into monster stories/fantasies, so the reason I love it is because it moved me inside. The graphics were incredibly realistic, the scenery and characters (WOMEN) beautiful and horrible (the good kind) all at once, and the plot reasonably complex such that I was immersed into the whole world. My heart was racing.<br/><br/>I honestly feel that this is a movie made by a man who is so passionate not only about movies, but beauty and horror. He was inspired by his father as a child to love the whole monster genre, but in the process to cultivate himself in the art of imagination. . . (he dedicated the movie to his father)<br/><br/>I feel Roger Ebert describes the movie well when he refers to Van Helsing as having ""a world that is violent and hectic, bizarre and entertaining, and sometimes very beautiful."" <br/><br/>I definitely want to hear Stephen Sommers explain why and how he created this world.

"MartinHafer","2","15","29","5 June 2008"," The BEST example of what is wrong with many Hollywood pictures today.
","This is probably the very best example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. When people around the world complain that Hollywood is churning out over-budgeted, special effects-laden films with brainless plots, this is the first film that comes to mind. It was as if the studio execs knowingly produced a bad film because they simply knew that marketing and stupid effects would draw the undiscerning teens like flies to a corpse. And, I hate to admit it, but if the bottom line is money, then this film was a success. The fact that it made millions is depressing and further supports the notion that crap sells and quality is irrelevant in a bottom-line world. I found it so offensively dumb that I wanted my money back after seeing it--and it was in a dollar theater!! My teenage daughter felt equally appalled and said ""that's an hour and a half of my life down the drain!"". I am so proud of my girl!<br/><br/>So let's talk about why I totally hated this film. Despite tons of money being spent on sets and all, it sounded like the dialog was written by a middle schooler. The worst example was the wretched and cliché-ridden scene where Van Helsing first meets his lady love. He walks into town as countless flying vampire maidens are soaring about--destroying the town and attacking the clichéd ""tough as nails"" heroine. Now, at this point, the annoying heroine is getting the crap knocked out of her by these vampires and Van Helsing literally saves her from certain death. So what does she do in the world of dumb dialog--she snaps out that she is doing just fine and she doesn't want his help! This is taking the spunky and petulant babe role to such a stupid extreme that I literally groaned out loud in the theater. And, did I mention is this 100% anachronistic film that Van Helsing helps her with the aid of a machine gun that shoots wooden stakes! Heck, such a gun would be next to impossible to make NOW--let alone back in the 19th century!!! The dialog and action is pretty consistent with this scene throughout the film--one petulant scene after another and one great special effects scene after another. While I appreciate the beauty of the special effects, without a plot and dialog, they are pretty much worthless.<br/><br/>Since seeing this wretched film, I have talked to dozens of my high school students and adults about this. With only a few exceptions, the kids liked it with such comments like ""I loved the action"" and ""the flying vampire babes were cool""--and no mention of the story or characters. Those who hated it (mostly, but not exclusively adults) described it as ""brainless"" or ""just plain dumb"". Just because impressionable kids LIKE this sort of tripe, should we, as responsible parents, let them feed on a constant diet of this brain-rot?! God help us, as these kids are our future!"

","Leave it to Stephen Sommers do outdo himself in the schlocky film-making department (see my MUMMY II review). I've never seen a movie exuberantly & giddy in its awfulness. This film is so moronic, on so many levels that it creates an all new style of cinema, a style that will never catch on (hopefully...) if one looks at the disappointing box office. The ""filmmaker"" doesn't care for anything but big noisy moments where everyone is screaming, or falling off of this wall or that cliff, all done in a extreme schlocky manner, including an orgy of terrible CGI, bad makeup, stupid characters and a plethora of incongruous elements so disparate that the end product looks like it was truly dreamed up by a 5 year old boy suffering from extreme ADD.<br/><br/>Sommers actually tried to make Van Helsing into a medieval James Bond, with the villain, being a campy Dracula (and his three hysterical bimbos) trying to destroy the world with their GREMLIN-like offsprings by having them energized by the ""lifeforce"" from Frankenstein's Monster. If that made any sense to you, you need to see a shrink!<br/><br/>The film is filled with soooooooooooooo many mistakes and goofs that it defies total logic, even for a film that belongs in the horror/fantasy genre. If werewolves only change in moonlight, how come Anna's brother was a werewolf during the daytime? Helsing recklessly firing his automatic crossbow in that village, even if there are people all around...I'm surprised no one was accidentally killed. Why did the lightnings strike the centuries-old stone overpass when the goofy Friar tried to cross it? And what happens to Anna at the climax. Moments like these basically show how Sommers was just winging it (and then some...) and had no idea what to do with Universal's classic monsters. The scene when Frankenstein's Monster swings across the overpass, only to crash through a window and tackles the female vampire, accidentally saving Anna, is by far the DUMBEST scene ever conceived in the history of cinema. That scene is filled with so many mistakes (why doesn't Anna just leave the room?) that Ed Wood would have been jealous of Sommers for creating something that actually eclipses everything the legendary bad filmmaker ever tried to make.<br/><br/>VAN HELSING is definitely one of the worst films ever made!"

"Elswet","9","12","23","9 January 2005"," VanHelsing; a Universal pleaser
","VanHelsing is a lovely, dark, atmospheric, action-packed, well written, brilliantly conceived, effects-tacular homage to Universal's classic Monsters of the 30's and the 40's.<br/><br/>Now, this was definitely NOT high art, that's for sure. And it strayed from what I had expected, considering it was Universal. You would expect the characters to be based on the older Universal monsters; or at least...I did. <br/><br/>The one thing which made me like this work so much was the treatment of the vampyres in flight. That was magnificent. I was so excited to see that on the big screen ... and I liked the treatment of Frankenstein's monster. He was much more like Shelly wrote him than Universal's first reincarnation of him. He was insightful, intelligent, and quoting Paradise Lost. He was brilliantly done. <br/><br/>Popcorn flicks are seriously underrated, though. I love the big effects and the big, epic feeling of those blockbuster-y KABOOM pics. I'm an Eye Candy whore, yes, but that's not all I look for. I thought there WAS a nice story here. It was really rather sweet. Dracula wanted his children to live. Okay, yes, he also wanted to use them to dominate the world and destroy (or enslave) mankind, but other than that, it was quite sentimental. <br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed, however, that we were not given the Gabriel/Abraham back-story. That is aggravating. Gabriel is called the ""right hand of God"" in the movie. Does that mean that Gabriel VanHelsing is somehow the archangel Gabriel? I dunno. It left a lot of questions for me. <br/><br/>The homagic sequences at the beginning, those filmed in an almost film noir style in the opening, did let me know right there at the door of this thing, that Sommers had tampered with the Universal formula. But even with the changes to the feel and the base story lines, I found this endeavor highly enjoyable. <br/><br/>They cannot explain it away by saying that THIS Frankenstein's monster was another one, and not the first, because they have Frankenstein there, screaming, ""It's alive!"" and not something else like, ""It's alive, again!"" or ""GO ME!"" Dracula clearly was not there in the original Universal installments to which this was supposed to be a continuation. <br/><br/>However, as was pointed out by My mate, Dracula could have been there in the originals, but ""dimly present,"" or downright invisible. He IS a master Vampyre, after all. But in this version, he was neither dim, invisible, nor absent. So...that leads us back to the beginning. Sommers tampered with the formula very deeply; I feel that's why this work struck such an errant note with most viewers. It just didn't feel quite right to the purists. <br/><br/>But for me, Van Helsing was a very different experience from that.<br/><br/>From time to time, there comes along a cinematic work which fills you with a sense of wonder and awe. For me, Van Helsing was the first one since the LotR trilogy to touch that place in my mind's eye. For open-minded fans of the old Universal classics, the use of black and white at the beginning gave a feeling of connection with the movie from the onset. Familiar characters, familiar settings, familiar stories; all with a fresh, new spin while maintaining the old familiarities. <br/><br/>The audience is treated to the best eye candy while making the attempt to maintain the integrity of the classics. You get to see vampyres in flight, the caring (and loving) conceptual makeup of Frankenstein's Monster, and a delightfully fresh treatment of VanHelsing combined with stellar performances, painstaking direction, and brilliant post-production work make this one of my new absolute favorites. The werewolves were quite good. <br/><br/>Of course, this work was also a Universal production, so they were able to use the Wolf Man words, ""Even a man who is good at heart and says his prayers by night..."" We were in the theater and my love said to me (quietly of course), ""They can't use that!"" ""Ah, but they can,"" I answered. ""This is Universal, too."" ""No wonder it's so good,"" was my love's only response.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the dialog. It was cleverly witty and delightfully fresh. As was the take on the whole enterprise. It was beautiful and dark, yet full of hope. I thoroughly enjoyed this attempt and hope they are amply successful with this work to warrant a sequel.<br/><br/>On a final note: while I thoroughly enjoyed the theatrical DVD release (""making of"" featurette, director's commentary and tons of extras for a theatrical version), I strongly suggest you get the Ultimate Edition available at amazon.com.<br/><br/>It rates just beneath Underworld at a 9.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

Understand that you can't go into a movie featuring Frankenstein's Monster and expect Shakespeare. The plot is admittedly thin, and the Universal Monsters have been around for so long that they've become somewhat unimpressive, but the director has done a very good job of minimizing these factors to create a visually and emotionally appealing film. The sets and characters are beautifully designed; there are no real instances of bad acting; the action is fast-paced and not too predictable; and the whole thing combines to create one really great adventure film, if you only give it a chance.

Wooden acting, VERY BAD VISUALS EFFECTS and boring like hell.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention this.Kate Beckinsale is the worst actress ever.<br/><br/>The movie plays like one long preview for a video game.  The film's CGI sets are as handsome as you'd find produced by the finest game machines.<br/><br/>Many, many times dialogue is idiotic: It has about as much life as a drained corpse. ""You can't kill me,"" Dracula actually says. ""I'm already dead!"" You're telling me.<br/><br/>
I went into Van Helsing expecting a cheesy B-movie.  Unfortunately, what I got was a very bad cheesy B-movie.  I give it a Z."

","I can't understand why people ostracize a movie negatively before it actually premieres? I watched ""Van Helsing"" 7 years ago and I was completely awestruck by it. The trailer previews doesn't even come close to the actual movie itself as it only shows the small tidbits of what you'll expect to see. The upper echelons at Universal Studios claimed the by the time trailer came into commission, the special effects was not fully completed. I had my doubts at first about seeing it, but in the end, and when the credits were rolling, I had to give a stand up applause. It was that phenomenal.<br/><br/>Sure the naysayers will easily be judgmental as Van Helsing will utilize his impressive arsenal of weapons as he embarks on an eclectic journey against the top villains that once graced the silver screen back in the 1930's and 1940's. From the Wolfman to Frankenstein, to Dracula the battles were extremely engaging and it was fun to see the dynamic monsters try to challenge this clever monster-slaying warrior. Granted, this movie will never win any Oscars, in fact the script is cheesier than a lasagne in an Italian restaurant. But if you like watching the biggest, the baddest, the most macabre bunch of monsters to ever hit the screen in one movie, well look no further.<br/><br/>The film is just fun to watch. The setting were sublime, the monsters were very graphical and effective. Sure it looks at times like a Simon Belmont video-game in terms of atmosphere, with Helsing defeating these evil beings. The weapons Van Helsing uses is cool enough to make even James bond green with envy. His fight with the Count was very exciting it will keep you glued to your seat as the action and scenery is what makes this movie special. <br/><br/>For those who yearn on artsy movies or like to dissect every anachronism that's featured well, it's never too late to turn away from it. Don't spoil it for others just because you're judgemental. But if you're passive about cheesy scripts, but scintillating entertainment, you don't want to miss ""Van Helsing"". Just sit back and let your mind relax."

","Being a fan of the classic Universal horror pictures, I was both dreading and looking forward to, this movie.  I walked out after one hour.  Loud, no sense of direction, dark, horrible CGI and terrible acting.  Particularly on the part of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula.  The ""brides"" were laughable.  The Wolfman was a total waste.  Another example of too much CGI, not enough real makeup.  I'd rather watch The Howling.  Most of the CGI scenes were dark scenes, especially the Wolfman scenes....always a sign of trouble.<br/><br/>
I recommend avoiding this film and sticking with the classics.  Go get the Monster Collection DVD and see the difference between great cinema (The Bride Of Frankenstein) and this wretched waste of time (Van Helsing)."

","I really like this film. It features non-stop eye candy, a likable hero, spooky settings, and tons of monsters, what's not to like?<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers is a director who basically goes all out and likes to pack on action sequence after action sequence.

One of his absolute best.<br/><br/>There are action films and then there are action films that literally don't let you catch your breath. This is one of the later.<br/><br/>There are a couple of small cheesy scenes and lines of dialog, but I believe they can be easily dismissed as the script really isn't bad at all. In fact there are some pretty good memorable lines here and there.<br/><br/>What can I say? I enjoyed it unlike a lot of reviewers here... but then again, I think a lot of people really enjoyed it.

","This movie really belongs in a special category: the worst 250 movies with a real budget.

The only audience that could be captured here would be 6 year old, but then again, it's too bloody for them to watch.<br/><br/>My advice is to stay away from this as far as possible."
"teemonster","10","7","12","8 May 2004"," Lighten up, kick back, and enjoy yourself!
","Something I seriously dig about Stephen Sommers: He's honest as a director and a writer.  In THE MUMMY RETURNS, Sommers dressed Brendan Fraiser in a leather jacket and Fedora as a response to critics of THE MUMMY that said Fraiser and Sommers were trying to be Indiana Jones. When he made THE SCORPION KING with WWF sensation, The Rock, over half the film included brawling or one-on-one fighting of some kind.  So with VAN HELSING, Sommers opens the film with an angry mob wielding pitchforks and torches. The first spoken dialogue: ""It's alive! ALIVE!""  And finally, it's shot in black and white.<br/><br/>Come on, folks, if you don't know EXACTLY what kind of movie you are about to get, then you are expecting way too much from VAN HELSING.<br/><br/>This movie does not disappoint. It delivers exactly what it promises: a monster mash! Dracula.  The Wolfman.  Frankenstein.  Igor. This is a ""Who's Who"" of movie monsters, and while a story featuring so many Hollywood heavy-hitters could come across being contrived, Sommers cleverly works it all out in a tight little story.  Unlike HELLBOY which had so many plot holes (provided you could figure out where they were going with it) you could drive a battering ram through them, VAN HELSING unfolds the plot layer by layer and then takes you on a massive roller coaster ride with everyone hanging on for dear life. This movie will make you jump, it will make you laugh, and if you're not careful, it might put a lump in your throat.<br/><br/>But Sommers, while doing all this, is being VERY HONEST as he does all this. Much in the same way PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN did not think itself anything other than a pirate movie based on a them park ride, VAN HELSING does not try to be anything else other than what it is at its core: a salute to monster movies. And not the over-the-top-gorefests like David Cronenberg's THE FLY, John Carpenter's THE THING, or any NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET offering...Sommer's salute are to the classics from Karloff, Chaney (Lon, not Dick), and Legosi.  There are also some nostalgic salutes to the classic Hammer House Films that featured Price, Lee (Christopher, not Bruce), and Cushing.  There is even a little nod to James Bond.  And while all this is going on, Sommers adds in dialog at the beginning of the film that clues you in...<br/><br/>Igor (to Dr. Frankenstein): Master...you have been so very good to me, you have been so very kind...(points to Dracula) but HE pays me.<br/><br/>This is your clue that this movie should not be taken seriously.<br/><br/>VAN HELSING is coming under a lot of fire from both critics, moviegoers, IMDB users all screaming ""it lacks originality"" or ""it's a mindless mess of special effects.""  These are people who are approaching this film as you would approach Kenneth Branagh's FRANKENSTEIN or Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA .  Approach VAN HELSING like that, and yes, you'll be sorely disappointed.  Approach VAN HELSING as you would ARMY OF DARKNESS or BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, and you'll have a ball.  Let MATRIX:RELOADED/REVOLUTIONS and HULK try to be important, poignant, and meaningful...VAN HELSING is a monster movie... ...and it's having a great time being one!"

","I will say that I am impressed with this movie, since it was on such a low budget! It is not the greatest film in the World, but it is exciting and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Somethings in this movie are a little over the top and at times a little corny, but that is what makes it so good. Hugh Jackman is the one I was most impressed with. He made Van Helsing very handsome and fun to watch. I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale, but this was not one of her best films, she did a good job though! The other actors did a very good job as well, but again Hugh Jackman really stoled the movie and was the best out of all! Van Helsing is at times funny, exciting, and keeps you on the edge of your seat at times. It is not as bad as some people make it out to be. This is a good movie to watch on a rain day, a boring Sunday afternoon or on Halloween.<br/><br/>Check out Van Helsing if you love a lot of action!"

","one of the best films i've seen in years. I took my mum to see it in may for her birthday and she loved it. The effects were amazing and jackmans portrayal of Van Helsing was brilliant. The man is a natural. Some of his fight scenes reminded me of him as wolverine in x-men. The atmosphere in the cinema was amazing. Van Helsing has such a dry sense of humour. When Helsing turned into the werewolf then back again all the women in the cinema had to catch their breath as it's not every day you see jackman in shammy leather. Jackman even did the voice over the animated film. I hope there will be a sequel to this as i will be first in line to see it."

","A lot of people have criticised this film for being too cheesy and not loyal to the original characters, but I think it is one of the best films so far this year. I'm a big fan of classic monster movies, and director Steven Sommers has taken the best of the big bads and modernised them to make a great kick-ass actioner. The costumes are great (a certain Miss Beckinsale looked fabulous in those boots and corset), the sets were breathtaking (I won't spoil anything but those of you who have yet to see it, keep an eye out for Dracula's Masked Ball!) and the movie even succeeds in making the audience jump out of their seats several times. Well, it worked on me anyway!<br/><br/>I only have one quibble and that is about the dialogue. Some of the lines are a little cringeworthy when heard, but there is always some great action sequence just round the corner to distract you. And though the characters don't exactly stay true to their legendary status (Sommers bent a few rules here and there) the movie still works well, and to be honest, I don't really care if it's not like the previous monster movies, and I'm sure many others won't either. Change is good, after all!<br/><br/>In short, this is a great action adventure film that's fun and fast-paced, with added eye candy for both guys and girls! So damn the critics, go see Van Helsing, you'll love it! It's just pure entertainment!"

","Van Helsing is one of those films which most people will either really enjoy, or really enjoy ripping to shreds. If you are a person who sees films as something to be taken seriously, then stay away. If however you go to the cinema or rent a DVD simply for entertainment, then this is ideal.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Sommers, with the Mummy films already under his belt, has produced a ridiculous but fun homage to early Universal classic horror films Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman. Calling it tongue-in-cheek would be a dramatic under-statement. The story is rather convoluted, but then it would take something original to fit all three of those Hollywood horror icons effectively into one story. But by never taking itself too seriously it largely side-steps any serious criticism of its' plot.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman revels in the Indiana Jones-esquire title role, which is a far cry from the Abraham Van Helsing of Bram Stoker's book (for one thing, he's a lot younger now with a different name!) and something else which is bound to infuriate the killjoys. Oops, sorry, I of course meant purists. Kate Beckinsale vamps it up again (almost literally) effectively reworking her role from Underworld, but her passion for the role seems to become lost under her heavy-handed Romanian accent. David Wenham though is a revelation in the role of Karl, Van Helsing's assistant, showing an impeccable sense of comic timing. Admittedly the lines are frequently horrendously corny, but that is part of the fun. Robbie Coltrane also has an excellent cameo as Mr Hyde early in the film. The only real criticism that can be levelled at the casting is Richard Roxborough's mis-casting as Dracula - the menace simply is not there, and he is more camp than count. Sesame Street's Dracula had more menace!<br/><br/>But with excellent special effects (too often going unappreciated in this modern technological age) and a simple but fun story, this film is a perfect popcorn movie for a Saturday night. Just remember not to think too much!"

","This is definitely one of the best movies of 2004. After being disappointed with the likes of 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'I, Robot' this was definitely a highlight of 2004.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman did a great interpretation of Van Helsing and so did Kate Beckinsale as Anna. A great entertaining movie with lots of special and visual effects, combined with a great story. This movie is far better than any of 'Lord of the Rings' movies - 'Van Helsing' shows us a real adventure and it's not boring for even one second, while we get tired and (or) fall asleep while watching 'Lord of the Rings'.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic movie and it definitely deserved all those millions it earned around the globe.<br/><br/>A masterpiece of 2004. The year 2004 was probably the worst year in movies, but this film definitely showed that there are still great films out there. Big congratulations to director Stephen Sommers for such a brilliant film.<br/><br/>The only other film that can manage to conquer 'Van Helsing' as 2004s best picture is definitely 'Spider-Man 2' but even that movie gets kinda boring in some parts and it's a little too long, while 'Van Helsing' lasts pretty long as well, but it's not boring for even one second.<br/><br/>The special and visual effects were amazing during the whole movie, and i just adore movies that are so entertaining and full of action, and has a great story and great actors on the other side.

"doombot3","9","9","17","20 May 2004"," this is not an adventure, it's a ride !!
","A rollercoaster of a movie, yes the CGI played to much of the movie but it works. Mr.Hyde puts the Mr.Hyde from the League of extraordinarily gentlemen to shame, the Wolfman looks stunning, Dracula and his brides... less so in they're a-sexual flying forms,Frankenstein's monster.. looks like a monster. I would have prefered Dracula to be more elegant, Sir Cristopher Lee was available and seeing as he wouldn't have to do any action (that was ALL CGI) It would have been a perfect fit. I enjoyed the movie it was full of action and had a story that I could suspend disbelief for, seeing as everybody already knows whom the Wolfman,Dracula,Fankenstein,Van Helsing are there was no need to tell their stories again so we could get right into the action.<br/><br/>It was a good thing the Vatican send Van Helsing to Transylvania, because Kate alone wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes with those monsters. you would have thought fighting your WHOLE life against Dracula and his minions would give you some insight (daylight raid ?!), she could have been a strong woman character but wasn't. Dracula was nice in a campy sort of way though not really scary in any form. Van Helsing was good and looked great in the hat and played his role though it wasn't much different from Wolverine... Igor was good, come with Dracula because you're my Goon now. Frankenstein's monster was good and brought meaning to: never judge a book by it's collar. the Brides looked and acted great and where the real menace instead of Dracula IMHO. CGI yes it can work marvelous, great scenery,monsters only the story and acting make a movie what it is and Van Helsing had enough story to make it work the acting could have been better at parts. Music was great !!!!<br/><br/>9 out of 10 for a not to serious though great movie."

","Partly because I'd heard in so many reviews that this movie was awful, and party just because it was one of the biggest flops of the year, I didn't have very high expectations of this one. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so damn much.<br/><br/>This movie follows the story of Doctor Gabriel Van Helsing, who we all know from Bram Stoker's Dracula as an ageing professor who takes on the evil count. Here, however, he is a young and handsome demon hunter / acrobatics expert with an array of cool weapons. In the opening scene of the movie we see Doctor Frankenstein, under the supervision of Dracula, bringing his monster to life while the torch-wielding peasants are already storming his castle. Meanwhile, Van Helsing takes on Mr Hyde in the Notre Dame Cathedral. These scenes pretty much set the tone of the whole thing. The plot has absolutely no internal consistency, but when the film looks this good, how much does it really matter? ... yes, it's stupid, but if you can get in the right frame of mind it can also be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The acting unfortunately isn't that great ... Hugh Jackman isn't really given a whole lot to work with as far as his Van Helsing character is concerned, and for the most part he simply gives his 'Wolverine' performance all over again, especially towards the end. Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress and has the perfect face for Gothic horror, as best shown in Underworld, but here with her silly Transylvanian accent and looking like Catherine Zeta Jones, it just doesn't work. Probably the most memorable performance comes from David 'Faramir' Wenham, who provides most of the comic relief as Van Helsing's bible-bashing sidekick.<br/><br/>In terms of special effects it's pretty amazing -- this movie did, after all, have a ludicrous amount of money thrown at it ($160 million), but perhaps relying so heavily on CGI was a mistake. Many directors have said that if an effect can be achieved physically, often that's the best route to take. And here, the computer-generated stuff is at times very distracting as rather than being involved in the plot you're sitting there thinking, ""Oo, doesn't that creature look good?"" The soundtrack is also very cool (even the bits stolen from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"").<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that this wasn't the box-office hit it was clearly intended to be, but if you're in the mood for a big, stupid, fun action movie that makes no sense and has absolutely no point to it, this one is as good as any."

","I thought this movie was excellent. It had everything...Action, horror, drama, romance, suspense, and comedy. I loved the changes it made from the normal way we view the classics. Such as the change of the werewolf. Ripping the skin off is quite different from just sprouting hair. Dracula and his brides were great, too. The change from human to demon--the way they feed. I would not want to be bit be them.  I did think that Igor was scarier than the Frankenstein monster and I had hoped that they would have found a way to save Anna instead of killing her. I hope that in the sequel they explain more of who Van Helsing really is as well. The character of Carl was an enjoyable one. His added humor was a welcome touch. Overall I loved it and would recommend it to anyone."
"dave-800","8","8","15","12 June 2005"," Good entertainment
","Although the script writer has taken unlimited liberties with the plots of both classic novels Dracula and Frankenstein, you cannot deny the blatant entertainment offered by this movie. The plot still works and the portrayal of the monsters and vampires, most notably Dracula's brides, is made superbly. Kate Beckinsale is very attractive as Anna Valerious and is the star of the show. Unfortunately, this is not matched by Hugh Jackman's performance as Van Helsing, but this does little to reduce the entertainment. Van Helsing has been unfairly over-criticised, but it never pretends to be anything other than a fun action/adventure movie."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>This is the best summer action film I think I have ever seen. There is a primary reason and several secondary ones.<br/><br/>The primary attraction is that these things are literally thrill rides. And in film today, the thrills come from how the camera moves, period. The state of the art in this regard has matured even in the last year as they've worked out how to sync virtual and real items with camera paths that are physically impossible.<br/><br/>Unlike the disastrous `Spiderman,' this camera dances with extreme energy. Notice how those camera paths are registered. We see the motions in the flight paths of the vampires: smooth swoop, hold, swoop in a slightly different direction as if they have discovered something, then end with a radical curve and redirection.<br/><br/>Then we experience that same flight pattern ourselves, subliminally making us the vampires. The by now close relationship between Sommers and his chief editor allow this to push, push, push energy, the energy of observation.<br/><br/>But that's not all I like. While the eye is in motion, the characters are in motion as well in the ordinary sense. But all the main characters are morphing, a different kind of motion. And as the movie progresses, we are taken through different films, yet another kind of motion of sight: Indiana Jones, Nosferatu, Gremlins 2, Star Wars, James Bond, Stagecoach, Alien, Eyes Wide Shut (in Budapest!) even esoterica like Spacehunter and Hudson Hawk. And of course in very literal ways, the Universal classics.<br/><br/>Every character transmutes except Kate, who is more of a tattoo here than a character. Her leather corset produces a waist not quite as small as Nichole Kidman's in Portrait of a Lady, but remarkable in any case.<br/><br/>I keep a database of films that employ absinthe. This one revolves around absinthe: the monster's heart and blood is absinthe and the whole tale can be cast as an absinthe vision (as was Moulin Rouge). Kate and Huge drink absinthe found in the windmill (as also in Moulin) and the story turns.<br/><br/>And another database on uses of the Alice in Wonderland metaphor, and another on architectural fireworks, and yet another on vision in redheads, all of which are in the fashion now. All appear here in strength.<br/><br/>It is a tradition that the strongest vampire wife of the three is the redhead and that she subliminally controls the entire scenario through sex. Stoker implied as much at the beginning and it is that redhead wife who captures and dooms Van Helsing in the book.   This redhead is the hidden centerpiece of the film as well as its vision. It features the amazing Elena Anaya who was the hidden motivator in the very best folded Alice story: Sex and Lucia, and also in Talk to Her which was similarly folded and depended on her motivation (as Eve in that case).<br/><br/>My only criticism of this is that the winged versions were Republicanized, sexless. A little Jess Franco-like Spanish sexual honesty would have gone a long way here.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Anyway, after seeing the movie I found my fears unwarranted - despite the plot less action, all the CGI, awful cooler-than-thou nods to James Bond (movies I hate) and Kate Beckinsale's strrrong woman I found this Universal homage surprisingly enjoyable. The fairy-tale version of ""late 19th century Tränsylveinia"", a place of the aristocratically evil vampires, sinister castles, moonlit forests, the werewolves and Frankenstein's monster, won me over.

Adding insult to injury the dialogs are ridiculous, and the story even worse, I felt like watching the League of extraordinary gentlemen all over again. Also the actors in the movie were drastically wasted behind a mist of CGI and a lot of scenery. It got to the point where it seemed like a badly knit bunch of scenes where Van Helsing was tried to be made into a sort of 007 from the past even recreating the laboratory where all his gadgets are made and just took Q for a ride including him in the mission. It seemed like a bad stew of stories from past authors with a new and bad twist mixed with CGI. Just plain bad. Although Kate Beckinsdale looked beautiful but we can always get a magazine for that."

","I'll admit I'm not usually one for scary movies, and I'll also admit that the only reason I really went to see Van Helsing was for the eye-candy. However, I was pleasantly surprised; Van Helsing turned out to be a good mixture of special effects, romance, suspense, etc.<br/><br/>I lost count of how many times I jumped out of my seat when Count Dracula appeared out of nowhere, but other than that, Richard Roxburgh made a good Count, as Hugh Jackman plays a very good Van Helsing. Even with his faults (and he had a few), I found myself liking his character. David Wenham provided comic relief and more than once me and my best friend were in violent fits of giggles from some of his lines (we're only fourteen ... you do that at our age).<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing, my favourite being the werewolf transformation. It was a bit gruesome, but very well-done a even lifelike I thought.<br/><br/>In conclusion: for anyone into this genre, Van Helsing is defintitely a must-see!!"

","Van Helsing was not quite as i expected, but then neither was Kate Beckinsale's last monster-duelling exploits in the wasted opportunity that was 'Underworld'. Van Helsing fares much better, largely due to the charisma of Hugh Jackman (X-Men's 'Wolverine' as if you didn't know). The CGI is indeed fantastic, with seamless transitions from man to beast and back again, but what i wasn't expecting was the fact that the writer seems to be working from a checklist of cliches, and not just horror/sc-fi ones. Everything is thrown into the mix here, cheesy lines galore (which Jackman gives a certain tongue in cheek style to, i must admit), and enough movie homages - obvious and obscure - to keep many film fans glued for a second viewing. <br/><br/>Overall, slightly scary, slightly camp, slightly ridiculous, but definitely a good night's entertainment. 7/10."

","I didn't expect Van Helsing to be Citizen Kane. I didn't WANT it to be Citizen Kane. Popcorn movies have a dignity and a reason to exist, and there is place for a cheesy werewolf/vampire feature in cinema.<br/><br/>Sadly, Van Helsing is a bloated mess. It bombards the audience with a moronic plot full of arbitrary rules, stupid McGuffins and absurd twists. A convoluted story should not be confused with texture or genuine complexity; for these movies, simplicity is a virtue. Instead we get a lot of mumbo- jumbo about the relationship between werewolves and Dracula, an antidote, Frankenstein being necessary to reanimate the count's spawn, and other preposterous rules.<br/><br/>However, what drives a stake through Van Helsing (har har) is the mediocrity of action scenes. With an overuse of awful CGI and a cartoonish ""everything can happen!"" attitude, they are pointless and incompetent. See the vampire attack, with Beckinsale's Anna bumping everywhere like a ping-pong ball in a tornado, without any consequence or sense of danger. And that silly werewolf kept springing out of nowhere like a furry Jack in the Box puppet. <br/><br/>One is tempted to say Van Helsing resembles a video game, but the truth is no major modern video game is so badly plotted and devoid of atmosphere. It's more like one of those platform games from the middle Nineties, with lots of jumps and lots of swinging on vines.<br/><br/>Jackman as the titular monster-slayer comes across as sedate and moribund. Beckinsale provides the eye-candy, so the camera can PG-13 leer at her tight trousers and cleavage, admittedly quite a sight. Roxbourgh has an original take on Dracula: he portrays the legendary monster as a campy, effete clown. Wenham as the Q-like comic sidekick/inventor is the only mildly likable character in this whole disaster.<br/><br/>4/10"

It's the old, if 10 killings were successful before in a film, lets try 100! <br/><br/>This is movie almost literally non-stop action for just over two hours. Oddly enough I liked this movie the first time I saw it. Maybe that was so because my expectations were very low. All I had read what criticism of this film, so I expected an awful film. About a year later, on my second look, now with raised expectations, I found it so ludicrous I canned it halfway through and this time agreed with the critics.<br/><br/>After one hour of the movie, your senses have been so bombarded with action that you are almost numb. The longest lull in the movie was probably two minutes. It's ridiculous. Plus, the dialog is incredibly stupid.<br/><br/>I wish Kate Bekinsale would can these tough-girl roles. They don't suit her. The only good character in the movie was Dracula, played by Richard Roxburgh and the best special-effects monster was the Wolf Man. Otherwise, this is two hours of the same people going after the same monsters with so much action that it actually gets boring."

In this movie he had better lines than anybody else, he even talked better, and those accents !! God where did they come up with those. The Mr Hyde looked like the very same Mr Hyde from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, at any rate very little difference. And the ending......arghhhhh it was awful.  This movie had the same crappy CGI that HULK had.

He really has that charm over women that Dracula was reputed to have and he looked great. Although Hugh Jackman did have some cool little scenes, they all look pretty rubbish next to Draculas...Definitely a must see for all Roxburgh fans.<br/><br/>Either way, it's still an entertaining film and if you're not expecting too much script and story wise, you'll have a blast watching it!<br/><br/>Can't wait for the DVD!"

Add to that the fact that Stephen Sommers is not a very good director and an even worse writer and what you have is a story that would struggle to make it as a comic book much less as a feature-length movie.<br/><br/>All throughout this misadventure into stupidity, Sommers tries to imbue his characters with personality and the story with some meaning. He fails on both counts. He wants to entertain us (I'm assuming) but instead winds up wasting about two hours of our time.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman does his best, but every line he is given is such a clunker that no matter how much you want to like him or his character, you just can't. Kate Beckinsale once again proves why she should never be allowed in front of a camera - every time she lays that horrible accent on us, you just want Dracula to rip her throat open so we can be done with her.<br/><br/>Except that if he did, she'd turn into one of those hideous CGI critters that someone, somewhere mistakenly thought would be a good idea.<br/><br/>This movie is a convoluted, idiotic mess designed to sell toys and rip our movie-going dollars from our pockets.

","I went to see Van Helsing thinking I would at least be partially entertained. I was wrong. I was bored out of my everlovin skull. The acting was abominable, and it was probably the best thing about the movie. I have rarely been exposed to such a toxically bad script. The ""monsters"" looked like something from the movie Shrek, and I'm not exaggerating. As a matter of fact I think Mr. Hyde was played by Shrek if I'm not mistaken. The outfits worn by the Van Helsing character and the unbelievable heroine were so ridiculous that I had to consciously force myself not to roll my eyes. And the Werewolf... Lord! How do I describe the failure of the Werewolf? Computer generated monsters are NOT scary, they are fantastical. A Werewolf is a fictional extension of a psychopath. Since, In reality, people are the most frightening thing on Earth, psychopathic killers are the most frightening people. A Werewolf is basically a hyper-psychotic, bent on killing and mutilation. It is therefore essential that for a Werewolf to be frightening, or for just about any humanlike monster to be frightening, the monster must be played by an actual human. that is another reason why the monsters in this film are such a disgrace to all the classic monsters of the past. This movie leaves out the human element; an element that must be present for any movie to succeed on ANY level or genre. By the way... since when does a guy turning into a werewolf have the ability to crawl backwards up a wall like Spiderman?"

","For more than a decade I have been reading the professional critics assessment of movies, and, compared those views to those of movie goers and my own. My conclusion, there is no rhyme nor reason to the critics reviews. Take a look at the aggregated critical assessment for this movie on RT.<br/><br/>'A hollow creature feature that suffers from CGI overload'. Only 23% of the critics liked the movie and gave is an unenthusiastic rating of 4.2'<br/><br/>Yet Pacific Rim, which is more overloaded with CGI and all the 'ills' of Van Helsing, gets this report:<br/><br/>'It may sport more style than substance, but Pacific Rim is a solid modern creature feature bolstered by fantastical imagery and an irresistible sense of fun'. 72% liked the movie blessed it with with a rating of 6.7'<br/><br/>What a load of rubbish. Moreover, this farce repeats endlessly throughout reviews by critics.<br/><br/>This incomprehensible inconsistency has lead me to one definitive conclusion. The critics have nothing of value to contribute to my assessment of a movie.<br/><br/>Instead, I use the comments (aggregated) by movie goers (found here on IMDb) and box office sales to provide a preliminary evaluation of a movie. This method is not always accurate, but, it is pretty good running a 75% - 85% success ratio.<br/><br/>Now for Van Helsing. A previous reviewer tagged his comment with 'Big Dumb Fun'. In my opinion, that is a perfect three word summary. The director assembled a talented cast, wove together several story lines from the horror movies of the 1930's, added a dash of James Bond gadgetry, enriched it with some good CGI, and, with the skill of a practised storyteller, created a high enjoyable experience for you and me.<br/><br/>It does depart from the same-old, same-old versions of the story told so many times before. If you want a movie that hews closer to the originals of the 30's, take a look at the excellent 'Bram Stocker's Dracula' (1992). However, if you are in the mood for a fun, big tub of popcorn version, this is the one for you.<br/><br/>My only regret is that the producer decided not to follow up with a sequel. If he had, I would have been first in line at the theater."

","From the moment the movie started i knew it was soon to be my favourite. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, the action never stops. From fighting a cross between the hunchback of notre-dame in Paris, to fighting count Dracula in his castle. I was astounded by how well the opening scene was choreographed with state of the art, special affects from the word go. there is never a glum moment, whether its Anna Valerious (KATE BECKINSALE) sprinting through the woods trying to escape from a CGI werewolf of its Van Helsing (HUGH JACKMAN) trying to shoot down three of Dracula's hideous air-born vampire wives with his mechanical bow and arrow in Transylvania. There are also many other astounding action scenes including, Anna's (Kate Beckinsale)brother turned into a werewolf after getting bitten by another while trying to save Anna, Count Dracula (RICHARD ROXBURGH, excellent acting) or the one, the only, Frankinstein's monster! You may be thinking its going to be trashy (stupid action constantly with no story) but you would be wrong. Van Helsing is sent to Transelvania to end the curse of the Valerious family by killing Dracula. Overall, Stephen Sommers (THE MUMMY, THE MUMMY RETURNS) has exceeded even his two previous blockbuster titles. I give Van Helsing a rating of 10. I have also received information that there will soon be a Van Helsing 2. (CAN'T WAIT!)"
"cherold","7","6","11","16 April 2005"," equal parts exciting and absurd
","I love director Stephen Sommers because of his apparent love for 40s B-movie thrillers, and perhaps that's why other people don't like him. It seems that a bad action movie with a modern sensibility like Spider-Man is always better received than a fun, distinctly old-fashioned picture like The Mummy. I don't know what to make of it.<br/><br/>Like The Mummy, Van Helsing got more bad reviews than it deserved, although admittedly it does have problems. The movie is best at the very beginning in a black and white sequence evoking the old Frankenstein/Dracula movies of the 40s while tossing in 21st century special effects. This is classic Sommers. It then changes to color, for no discernible reason except you can't make a whole movie in black and white in 2004.<br/><br/>Action scenes are incredibly exciting. The movie is big and fast and monster transformations happen with a tremendous speed that makes them at times startling. Hugh Jackman is great and Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous.<br/><br/>But while Van Helsing is exciting, it fails miserably at being scary. This is the movie's weak point. The vampire's hover between scary and camp, not quite landing at either point. So what should be eerie or terrifying just comes across as silly. It feels as though Sommers realized he couldn't get scary and so played some scenes for laughs, but he couldn't give up the idea of making things scary so he kept trying, basically fighting against himself.<br/><br/>One also has pretty much no feeling for the characters. This is perhaps the main difference between Van Helsing and those old horror movies, which mixed a sense of tragedy and loss into the thrills. But for all its flaws, the movie has that roller-coaster thrill ride sensibility that keeps a smile on your face."

","The fearless vampire killer (Hugh Jackman) is sent to Transylvania to seek out Anna (Kate Beckinsale) and aid her in her quest to rid the countryside of Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). Once there, he encounters the evil Count's diabolical plot tohave children! <br/><br/>Yes, the movie is as goofy as it sounds. Director Stephen Sommers has entirely done away with any attempts to scare the audience and made an action fantasy out of the classic horror characters. The movie opens rather poorly, with Van Helsing tracking Mr. Hyde into Notre Dame and subsequently killing him. The action is sluggish, the one-liners are lame and the computer effects are lame. After the action moves to Transylvania, the movie picks up speed in a campy fashion and quickly becomes a guilty pleasure. Beckinsale, as the last in a family cursed by Dracula, is wonderful; complete with skin-tight wardrobe and overdone accent she matches Jackman's one-liners with perfect ease. Roxburgh, as Dracula, is about the only truly good performer on hand. His version of the vampire would be menacing in a movie that was not going for camp. But, if this movie had been serious it would be the complete failure many consider it to be. I don't know whether the laughs were intentional, but without them this movie would be a bomb. The three brides of Dracula are the most hilarious of all the characters, spouting lines as though they were recently kicked off a soap opera. The movie would have benefited from scaling back on the computer effects. There are so many and none are very convincing. The worst being the Mr. Hyde character, but he is not present after the first 10 minutes. The werewolf is not too good either; it is an obvious, unconvincing effect that should have been thought out more carefully before transferring it to the screen. The idea of having the skin of the human ripped off to reveal the monster underneath is very flawed; how many layers does he/it have? As with most pre-programmed summer blockbusters, check your brain at the door and you will have a good time."

","Van Helsing is basically the story of a monster hunter who lives in the world of Gothic 19th century creatures. The movie is not so much horror but steam-punk science fiction. He works for a worldwide peacekeeping service that employs anyone from Islamic to Buddhist and is surprisingly enough based in the Vatican. Van Helsing looks an awful lot like the WWE wrestler the Undertaker.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is called to Transylvania to kill Dracula. Even though its cold, dark, and a few people every month die as sacrifices to the vampires there are still quite a few people living there. And even though the town is in Europe people still use feet and inches. There he finds Anna who looks like a 16th century pirate in fancy clothes while everyone else wears rags. Anna's family has basically fought against Dracula for centuries and no one can kill him, now she is the only one left and Van Helsing has to save her.<br/><br/>The computer graphics and special effects are very good and the story is decent. All the monsters are nicely animated except for Frankenstein's creature who looks very fake in the costume. The movie looks very corny from the beginning with items like automatic crossbows and self spinning throwing stars. Its basically batman set 100 years before and with a lady buccaneer.

","VAN HELSING is Stephen Sommers' latest tribute to the horror-action classics of the early age of film. His last two attempts, THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS were resounding successes, each with a talented, dynamic cast, rip-roaring action scenes, giddy humour and innovative special effects. But the quality that these two films possessed that resulted in their popularity was the fact that they did not take themselves too seriously. The entire atmosphere was one of light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek satire; every scene had a funny line, every character had their moments. The entire plot and backstory were a load of garbage, but Sommers made no attempt to defend this- rather, he exploited it, concocting each film as a skilful mix of horror, action and comedy.<br/><br/>VAN HELSING keeps the unconvincing horror and the schlocky action, but dispenses with the comedy, meaning that the film is presented in a mood of self-mocking severity, which is inadvisable given its B-grade content. I won't insult your intelligence by going through the insipid storyline. Let it suffice to say that Gabriel Van Helsing is an enigmatic nineteenth-century monster hunter working for the special operations branch of the Catholic Church (!!). In his travels, he does battle against an agglomeration of monsters from the horror films of the early twentieth century, such as Frankenstein's Monster (Shuler Hensley), Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane), the Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and, of course, the notorious Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), deformed by the stupid plot as a shallow, James-Bond-style ""criminal mastermind"".<br/><br/>He is joined on his quest by the luscious Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), who has little to do other than look good, given her brainless dialogue, and her battles against Dracula's harem, which are little more than softcore lesbian catfights. Probably the biggest wet blanket in the cast is the uncharacteristically wooden Hugh Jackman in the lead role, whose woeful acting is an exemplar of the film's new, shamefully schlocky mood.<br/><br/>The ""horror"" in the film consists entirely of gaudy computer-generated effects, all of which are about as frightening as Barney the Dinosaur in a clown mask. The ""action"" consists of Jackman and Beckinsale shooting up computer-generated monsters with implausibly anachronistic weapons, supplied by Carl (David Wenham), the Catholic Church's chief armourer (!!!).<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that I had to dwell on the film's flaws for much of this review, because there are a few merits. Even if it's not scary, it still looks awesome, particularly the Balkan wilderness vistas, which rival those in the Lord of the Rings. The music is masterfully composed and very atmospheric. The art direction, while, again, failing to frighten, is still skilful and beautiful to look at. Unlike the rest of the cast, David Wenham shines, possibly the only one not to take his role too seriously, a sole vestige of Stephen Sommers' better days in THE MUMMY.<br/><br/>It looks great, it sounds good - 2/3 ain't bad. But if it's chills and thrills - or even plot and acting - that you want, you're looking in the wrong place. 6/10, purely for presentation. This film has no substance."

Still, for a mainstream film-goer like myself, I found enjoyment and relaxation in a well-paced adventure. <br/><br/>A thoughtful screenplay keeps the action coming, while there's many an exciting aerial shot. Sumptuous costumes, props and locations complete a satisfying visual experience. Although CGI runs riot in this movie, at some points it works rather well. Dracula's flying brides, for example, look stunning, at least when airborne.<br/><br/>The script, such that it is, veers between cheesy one liners and brisk conversation. Dialogue is mostly confined to moving action forward, so has a ""comic book"" feel. Inventive plot points get overshadowed due to this approach.<br/><br/>Beckinsale and O' Connor (who played a similar entertaining villain in the Mummy films) do their best to entertain, while David Wenham and Shuler Hensley are pitch perfect and well-cast.

","Yikes! What a bombastic, over-the-top, third rate CGI fantasy ride. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what Jackman and Beckinsale thought they signed up for, but when they sat back and watched the film, after all the ""special defects"" were worked in during post-production, I'm sure they whimpered and felt as cheated as future audiences did. <br/><br/>Besides a ho-hum storyline, the tale was plagued by clichés (including a cookie cutter sidekick that was intelligent, yet meek as well as goofy), and extraordinarily weak matte paintings and CGI. Heck, some of the CGI almost mirrored the claymation of old in its unrealistic stiffness.<br/><br/>Most scenes, however, were drawn out to the point where they lost any hold on the viewer. Even worse, many of the human characters, no matter how much pain and suffering they endured at the hands of vampires, werewolves and such, brushed themselves off with barely a scratch and moved on. Please. <br/><br/>Weak, trite, boring and not worth watching except for maybe a laugh."
"ChavRose06","10","5","9","10 October 2004"," Mr Sommers! What were you thinking??
","First of all I heard so much praise for this particular action flick. Director Stephen Sommers did so well with ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", but somehow lost his way when it came to ""Van Helsing"". What was wrong with it? Besides almost shattering Hugh Jackman's acting career and adding to the humiliation of Kate Beckinsale's acting career? Nothing really. However, lots of really good special effects, a drool-worthy cast and a poorly developed script, don't sell at the box office, that is where films like ""Troy"" are catergorised.<br/><br/>The cast was well hand picked, Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, he is a man of many talents but I wasn't entirely sure if he made a good decision signing on for this picture, Kate Beckinsale is beautiful as Anna, but I'll admit that her Romanian accent in the film was almost laughable if you know what I mean. Richard Roxburgh as the one and only Count Dracula, excellent pick and I'll agree most of the girls in the cinema went home smiling after they heard his sexy Romanian accent, David Wenham as Carl, he made the audience laugh out loud and in every good action picture you need a comic relief and Wenham made us laugh. So the cast was delicious. But that didn't seem to work for the viewing public.<br/><br/>I'll be honest with you I only watched it because of Hugh Jackman. I think most female viewers watched it because of Jackman and the male viewers watched it because of Kate Beckinsale.<br/><br/>It also flopped because of the overload of special effects, as a digital animation student we need to earn a living so you can't blame us there. However action packed special effects movies don't sell well, that is where ""Chronicles of Riddick"" went down hill.<br/><br/>Now the script is where the biggest blunder is. I shall quote from the film: ""...Because the only thing that can kill him is a werewolf..."". Okay anyone who has an extensive knowledge of vampires should correct them if they are wrong. Where were the writers who wrote the scripts for 'The Mummy' and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" I ask you? The answer is unknown. <br/><br/>I recently bought the Van Helsing DVD and was taken in with all the special features, since I have studied film and animation I am all for 'Behind The Scenes' and I developed empathy for the cast and crew, as a director you never believe that your film is going to crash and burn. Also it is good that you have a good time making the film and judging by what I watched on the featurettes, they seemed happy.<br/><br/>Mr Sommers, don't take it personally, just learn from your mistakes and if you're going to make a sequel to Van Helsing, please try harder!<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention."

","The one line summary basically sums up my feelings about this film.  I went into Van Helsing hoping that it would be a great way to start off the long awaited summer movie season.  Instead, I got the ultimate peice of S*** that is not worth viewing even once. (I snuck out and went to see some of Kill Bill at one point.)<br/><br/>One way to describe Van Helsing is that it is lke a Johnny Depp movie, the only reason you might want to see it is because of Depp's prescence. In this case, that honor goes to leading man Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman.  he does a pretty good job playing the average demon hunter.  Other than that, well, the film is basically an accident waiting to happen.<br/><br/>Terrible acting and sub-par effects don't come close to the amount of familiar scenery and concepts that I have seen in other films.  If you've seen Blade, Blade II, Mortal Kombat 2 and The Lord of the Rings 3, you've seen alot of Van Helsing before.<br/><br/>In short, this flick should be shipped directly to video & DVD and used for target practice.  Definantly one of the worst movies ever made.<br/><br/>P.S. Richard Roxburgh needs some help with his Transylvanian accent."

","This is the first time I have ever been tempted to walk out of a movie within the first five minutes, but since I paid 11 bucks for it, I figured I would stick it out. Hugh Jackman was miscast, and Kate Beckinsale looked great but her accent was horrible. Richard Roxburgh (as Count Dracula) was actually pretty good. He was the only one who really looked like he was having fun as he chewed the scenery. Unfortunately, he was the only one who took this route for his performance. The comedy was stale, the action was cookie-cutter, and the plot was uninteresting. I felt like this movie didn't know what it wanted to be. I think it could have been a pretty decent, campy, fun film, but instead, it just takes itself way too seriously and ends up scoring extremely high on the unintentional comedy scale as a result."

","Oh Hollywood these days! They seem to be too scared from original themes so they just repack, remix and recycle old ideas, spoiling everything in the mix. They took several classic monsters this time, took some good looking but totally off actors (they just don't fit into horror movie), randomly mixed ideas from about 20 books and 20 movies to totally inappropriate places and used about 1.004.245 computers to render very bizarre looking castles composed from bits of real places and lots and lots of monsters. The monsters do look cheesy (they seem like demos for old Radeon graphics cards), but there are hundreds of them so it looks COOL. There is no reasonable plot, just non stop action which looks COOL. The action scenes are mostly rendered so they can create COOL shots, camera circles around the action like fly on LSD which is probably COOL too. Everyone knows the story is unimportant, its only function is to bring us to another COOL action scene. Lots of Eastern Europe mythological beings are wasted - the Eastern horror stories are slow, dark and very bloody. There is no blood (to get good ratings, probably) so the whole movie looks like insane battle of little plastic soldiers - Cobra 11 style. Well if you want to enjoy this mess designed for 10 years old boys with attention deficit syndrome you shall probably take a lot of beer with it.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Once upon a time Hollywood developed a love for the monster. With people like Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, the monster movie thrived. Eventually however, this trend grew tiresome and lost it's appeal. In recent years the monsters have returned in their original book based forms. Branagth's ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" and Oldman's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" were brilliant films because they introduced people to the true original stories. It was never going to be long though before Karloff's style of monster movie would return, and thus with this in mind, we are presented with ""Van Helsing"".<br/><br/>Gabriel Van Helsing, played by Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman, is one of the Church's greatest monster hunters. Sent by the Church on countless missions to stop the world's evil, Van Helsing is an intelligent fighter with a stupid hat. In his latest case, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to stop the evil Count Dracula. In his adventures Van Helsing encounters vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster and the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale (albeit with an awful new accent).<br/><br/>First things first, I don't understand why people hate this movie. I remember going to see ""The League Of [not so] extraordinary Gentlemen"" last year and detesting it. Whilst that movie possessed an awful script and a dire cast (Connery in particular drove me to tears with a hideous performance), in ""Van Helsing"" I found myself really enjoying it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'll admit from the start that an element of this movie is incredibly tacky. Ultimately though, I think it thrives past that. I went to see this movie with a fair bit of pessimism I'll confess. Whilst I do love what Hollywood did with the original monster movies, I'm a stickler for the originals and tend to dislike the idea of stories being rewritten. With this in mind I'd gone to see this with an element of caution. Paranoid of how they would portray Dracula and the Monster, I stepped in slowly expecting the worst. The thing is though that it's hard to hate this. Whilst I did feel that they ruined the Igor character, Sommers (director & writer) versions of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster felt fresh and intriguing. I sat, I watched, I enjoyed. Enough said really.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I'd recommend most people go to see this movie. I'll admit that it's not for everyone. A friend of mine tends to only watch movies which are character driven and with a lot of drama (top films are ""American Beauty"" and ""The Green Mile""), and so to him I'd probably suggest he avoid this. To anyone who just feels the need to sit and relax at nighttime though, this movie has to be an option. Jackman is ok in this role, although I do wish there had been an alternative to completely rewriting the Van Helsing character from the mad old professor to the super hero, Beckinsale is good too, even with the awful accent. The monsters as well, Roxburgh as the camp Count makes for entertaining viewing, Hensley as Frankenstein's creation reminds me of Marvin the Paranoid Robot from ""Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy"" in the way that he seems to moan so much, and the CGI Wolfman impresses too.<br/><br/>In the end, it's difficult to condemn this movie (even though others have managed so successfully). I'll confess it is at times ridiculously camp, and at times it can make you groan in it's predictability and tacky nature, but it never feels like it is taking itself seriously. This movie's occasional tributes to other movies, it's throw away lines, it's disregard for Hollywood taboos, it just smacks of fun. Which is exactly what it is. If people want to moan about this movie, that's their choice, for me though, it's perfect mind numbing material."
"mitesh-sahu","8","5","10","29 December 2013"," Fantastic - Nothing but Fantastic!!!
","As I have mentioned, this movie is nothing but FANTASTIC... I have read both Mary Shelly's Frankestien and Bram Stoker's Dracula but this is beyond both. In the true sense of Novels, I have loved it. It sums up the futuristic and medieval novels to an extent that it becomes a story of its own. <br/><br/>Whilst, I would not want any human being on this earth to miss this movie still for the sake of it, I will write a review. It contains and mixes Sci-fi, spiritual and gorish elements that make it ordinary but still it draws inspiration from all of these.<br/><br/>The story is simple, Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman) has to stop Dracula and he does not know how. He gets a warrant from Rome and executes it with the help of his companion Carl(David Wenham). Stephen Sommers is a director of too much grit in movie making. He has chosen to give Mummy's incredible power and believes that just like God evil has its own will to move forward. This movie does the same. Challenge the Almighty and fail. The ultimate fight of Good vs Evil. Where good wins because the will and not the weakness of the evil. A fight to death that makes Dracula believe that he has finally found his match. The portrayals of the character of Dracula, Van Helsing(different first name) has been epic. The visuals according to me whether CGI or just plain movie making have been good. Maybe due to my Indian heritage I felt the movie was less time consuming still I feel it was perfect. While Kate Beckinsale, Josie Maran and the other two ladies make the men go mad Hugh and Richard Roxburgh make the women crazy with their intelligent & beautiful acting. It is a perfect movie to be seen during a holiday. Alan Silvestri makes it good with the background score and the people acting in it bring it to life. A story weaved with logic, reason and fantasy. <br/><br/>A perfect blockbuster with good cast and music. Watch it for a good re- imagination of the books that this movie relates to. 8 stars of 10. Would love another Van Helsing movie with a bit more.<br/><br/>A late review but fans' of Dracula, Frankestien and Hugh would love it. Still wonder why Hugh chooses movies that makes sure that the woman his character loves won't be with him . May be he loves his wife too much.<br/><br/>Watch it as a couple of classic stories with a modern twist."

","Let's face it... here on IMDb people only enter reviews for films they truly love or truly hate. I can't see many people logging in to write a review of a film they found mildly entertaining. Well there may be some but they probably should get out a bit more.<br/><br/>In the case of Van Helsing I think I can honestly say that it's the film I love to hate. I feel it's so bad that it belongs up there with Batman & Robin as a possible contender for the worst film of all time.<br/><br/>Where to begin....<br/><br/>Almost the entire failure of this mess can be attributed to Stephen Sommer the director. When he directed the Mummy he was relatively unknown so the studio kept him on a tight leash and as a result we got a well balanced kind of Indianna Jones film with horror homages. It worked well and I thought it lots of fun.<br/><br/>Then I saw what Stephen was capable of when you take the leash off in The Mummy Returns. Dear god what a mess. Plot goes out the window, tonnes of cheap, lazy and pointless CGI comes in and characterisation is completely ignored. Sommer had become the king of CGI for the sake of it...<br/><br/>The film begins in black and white as an obvious homage to the classic horror films of Dracula and Frankenstein but it quickly becomes apparent that the huge CGI budget won't be used to any decent effect when you realise that the only alteration to the actual picture is that the colour has been removed. No CGI is used to give the black and white section a grainy or authentic look. You could get the same effect just turning down the colour on your TV.<br/><br/>Then we meet Dracula. He's awful. A caricature of the classic horror villain rather than an actual depiction. There's no threat to him, at all. He looks like he's just turned up at your parents Halloween party in a slightly expensive outfit.<br/><br/>Van Helsing himself is just Hugh Jackman playing Hugh Jackman in a Van Helsing costume.<br/><br/>David Whenham's sidekick is rather embarrassing to watch as the Aussie actor does his best to take on a comic English accent and has a go at slapstick (which he fails at miserably by the way).<br/><br/>Kate Beckensale is always easy on the eyes but aside from being a woman with a need for vengeance there's very little for her to do.<br/><br/>After a slightly odd battle between our hero's and a bunch of flying chicks in the local village things descend into the incomprehensible.<br/><br/>The story jerks along between one CGI set piece and the next and takes so many ridiculous turns that you give up trying to follow it after a while. Instead you sit back and let the CGI awfulness wash over you until you decide to turn it off.<br/><br/>The problem is that because no time is spent on any of the characters or the story, you just don't give a toss about what's happening on screen no matter how mind-boggling a stunt the CGI is trying its best to suggest.<br/><br/>Bottom line this film should have been a wonderful homage to the age of the classic horror movie. Each character, good and bad, should have been lovingly represented with the care and attention they deserved.<br/><br/>Instead each character is shoehorned in as an excuse to show more badly rendered CGI.<br/><br/>There's no love here, at all. It's just vacuous action with no point to it other than to make you say ""wow look at all that CGI"".<br/><br/>If you're the sort of person who complains about a film because there's too much talking in it then this may be for you.<br/><br/>The rest of us need to be aware that drivel like this actually exists and needs to be avoided at all costs."

","I don't think this movie was underrated or under-appreciated in any way...In fact, I think that this movie deserves way more criticism and more bad reviews. Personally, I don't think that were anything remotely funny or interesting about this movie: It is true that the plot seem like something borrowed from a cheap, ""B"" movie, but, unlike those cheap flicks, ""Van Helsing"" feels terribly forced, dull, and, the worst of it is that is incredibly boring.<br/><br/>Yes, it is boring. The plot is filled with all the elements from summer blockbusters and also it is so incredibly over the top that somebody could expect this to be entertaining, at least. Sadly, instead of that, ""Van Helsing"" feels just idiotic and endless, with unfunny jokes, unmotivated action scenes, a plot that goes nowhere, flat characters that are very hard to relate. Honestly, I don't what Stephen Sommers was trying to do with this movie: If this was supposed to be an homage to all the classic monster histories, it just fails, mostly because of the immense amount of ""liberties"" that he took about the whole mythology that exists around all the characters that appear in this movie. Most of those change seem gratuitous, or just made in order to make everything ""cooler"" for the modern audience. (I think that could be done without reaching this level of ridiculousness, that put this on the same level of other cinematic disasters, such as ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" from Stephen Norrington, or ""The Brothers Grimm"" from Terry Gilliam) Avoid it.<br/><br/>I think that ""Van Helsing"" was the first vampire movie to be this bad. Then, ""Twilight"" appeared, but that's another story."

","Although writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's ""The Mummy,"" he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel ""The Mummy Returns,"" a prime example of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and ""exciting"" things going on, but somehow is strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's ""Van Helsing,"" although not as bad.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) in Transylvania to fight Dracula, his three lovely but vicious brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, vampire babies, etc.<br/><br/>It won't take long for the viewer to perceive that ""Van Helsing"" shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a partial parody/homage of the classic Universal monster movies and part serious, just barely. Imagine ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) with the over-the-top thrills of Indiana Jones and the flair of classic monster parodies like ""The Vampire Happening"" (1971) or ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) and you'd have a good approximation.<br/><br/>The film looks good, but there's too much CGI and some of the monsters look really cartoony, like Mr. Hyde and the werewolves. Others look quite good, like the flying vampire brides and Frankenstein's monster. As was the case with ""The Mummy Returns"" the film is strangely tedious despite all the manic happenings. Thankfully, there are worthy hints of depth, e.g. the Frankenstein monster and Anna. I wish there was more.<br/><br/>Speaking of Anna, Kate Beckinsale is definitely one of the highlights here as she looks stunning throughout in an amazing form-fitting costume and thigh-high boots seemingly appropriate for the late 1800s (speaking as someone who's not even a Beckinsale fan). Josie Maran and Elena Anaya are also striking as two of Dracula's wives, Marishka and Aleera. Needless to say, excellent job on the female front. On the other side of the spectrum, Jackman is a great, masculine leading man, perfect for the role. Richard Roxburgh (Dracula), David Wenham (Carl), Kevin J. O'Connor (Igor) and Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein's monster) are all entertaining or effective.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, though, ""Van Helsing"" barely rises above the limitations of what it is: a big, dumb modern blockbuster with all its over-the-top trappings. Considering the $160 million thrown into it, it shoulda/coulda been better. The story needed time to breathe and less constant mania. The movie's also over-long at 2 hours and 11 minutes. Still, it's better than ""The Mummy Returns"" and there's enough here to make it worthwhile, if you're in the mood for this type of fare.<br/><br/>THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Czech Republic, Rome and Paris with studio work done in Southern Cal and Orlando, Florida.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-/C+"

","Hum. I don't know what exactly I think of this film. I have two opposing opinions, exactly, but they coexist well enough for me to give Van Helsing five out of ten. So here's my split- personality opinion: The Pros: Well, number one is Hugh Jackman. He's very into the character--you can tell he believes in it, and that makes Van Helsing believable, even if he seems a little out-of-period. Whatever. I don't care. Also number one for ... aesthetic reasons. In addition, the actual ""monsters"" are very close to their originals. Finally! A Dracula who has all the seductive power of Bram Stoker's original; a Monster who converses intelligently (instead of pained Irnghs) and seems very soulful-also close to Mary Shelley's original. Hyde, well, whatever. I didn't like the book anyway. The Cons: Believability for the HUMANS. I stress humans. Supernatural monsters can do whatever they want, because they don't adhere to our rules. So if Frankenstein's monster wants to wrestle a flying bat-bride of Drakula, fine by me. But, please. Anna falls down, hits every branch in a huge tree, lands on her back, and isn't hurt? Must be the corset and those dominatrix boots ... Actually, I realize most of the problems in this film stem from Anna. If she weren't there, and they swapped her with her brother ... that would have been much better. Also: the ending. Lord. Can you think of anything sappier than dead people's faces floating around in the sky, smiling down on Van Helsing??? I think this is what they should have done: Obviously, the Creature has the ability to give life. Moved by his experience with these people who see beyond his inherent ugliness, he decides to submit to the pain one more time to give life to the one who died. This would thus cut the horrid sun-smiling scene. Urgh. But of course, that's my opinion--and I'm not paid millions of dollars to write and direct movies. But whatever."

"mentalcritic","1","4","8","10 October 2004"," A disturbingly bad idea...
","The idea for a sequel to the woefully miscast 1990s production of Dracula had been floating around for some years when the decision was made to make Van Helsing younger and turn him into a mercenary. Anyone who is aware of how religious fanaticism and science were virtually at war in the nineteenth century can see how inane this idea is. Hollywood makes its Christian ownership all the more obvious, however, by failing to recognise this basic fact.<br/><br/>That aside, the story started out well, with a raid upon the Frankenstein manor culminating with Dracula and the monster taking off to parts unknown. The problem is, once the titular hero is introduced, it is all downhill. The most profound example of the film's lack of respect for the audience's intelligence lies in the scene when Van Helsing meets Whatshername. As the harpies come out of the woodwork to assault the town, Van Helsing sets about taking them down with an automatic crossbow. So far, so good, but the way in which Van Helsing fires, one would be hard pressed to credit him with being able to hit the sidewalk using a can of paint. Naturally, no villagers are killed by friendly fire despite the fact that hundreds of crossbow bolts are fired in every direction.<br/><br/>It gets worse from there. Much, much worse. One of my favourite scenes is the vampire egg-hatching sequence. Seriously, our heroes just wander through this area with no regard for what might happen if they are discovered. The usage the villains get is incredibly uneven, too. The Frankenstein monster is little more than a plot device, and the Werewolf is only there to facilitate how Dracula is brought down. Making this all about Dracula might have worked if Dracula had not been so incredibly non-charismatic.<br/><br/>After Underworld, Kate Beckinsale needed to appear in something decent fast before she killed her career. Van Helsing is therefore the definition of a bad career move. If Beckinsale is capable of defining her characters through anything other than costume changes, she'd best prove it in her next appearance. Van Helsing sure hasn't done David Wenham any favours, either. The goofy sidekick routine is now so old and tired that he starts being annoying as soon as his character is introduced, and never really stops.<br/><br/>I won't get into the use of special effects here, as while they were quite obviously the focus of the film, they aren't the real problem. Nor is the acting as such, although obviously it didn't work against the limitations of the material. The problem here is that the story was given about as much thought as a pop song, if that. Even after watching the film for a second or third time, one is hard pressed to remember the precise details of the story. The words ""tacked on"" can be used a lot to describe some plot elements, with the final fight between Van Helsing's group and Dracula being convoluted beyond belief. It's almost like time slows down during this part of the film.<br/><br/>I gave Van Helsing a one out of ten. After such fun pieces as The Mummy, one would have expected something better out of Stephen Sommers. With this film, he gets dangerously close to the status of one-trick pony. It defies belief that Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are not rising to meet production budgets when they are spending said budgets on dreck like this."

","I was in total shock at what i had just witnessed when the film was over. It was a mess. The action was directed awfully and the story was told very poorly. The pacing of the film seems to try to intentionally swallow up the boring story that sets at the base of the film. Hugh Jackman (which i don't like that much anyway) is dreadful as van helsing. They've turned him into neo from the matrix. I mean 21st century weaponry in the 19th century, come on! Kate Beckinsale who was great in ""Underworld"" (even though that wasn't the best movie) was very stale in this role. She almost seems to be auditioning for the part of frankenstein in the film.The ultimate poor excuse for a performance in this film belongs to Richard Roxonbourgh who plays count Dracula. He plays Dracula with a coe sense of fun, but it's not fun. In fact it's the fartherest thing from fun. He parades around with no emotional control and delivers his ""Wonderful"" dialogue. He changes shapes and acts a little too femine at times as well. Enough said about the acting either that or my head will implode. Well at least the special effects were great, right? NNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEE!<br/><br/>God these effects were freaking terrible. Why cgi everything? Why not go back to the great films of the 30's and 40's. Like ""Frankenstein vs The Wolf Man"", that was a classic piece of storytelling and the acting and special effects are great. Well oh well Hollywood has managed to squander another great idea."

","Kicking off the summer movie season with a bang, Van Helsing is a wonderful reminder to why one should just go in to cinematic hibernation from May until September. The story makes no sense what so ever, the mythologies of all three monsters are horribly distorted, and Kate Beckinsale is 2 for 2 when it comes to Vampire/Werewolf movies that suck. I would have had a better rime if I had paid $6.00 to watch a middle finger on the screen for two hours. Either that or have Lon Cheney come back to life and kick me in the balls."
"jonann2","1","6","14","9 May 2004"," This film is horrible!!!
","I didn't want to see Van Helsing in the first place, but my friends talked me into it.  I was not disappointed because I went into the film with low expectations.  My expectations proved valid.  What the makers of this film have done to the character of Van Helsing is a disgrace.  In the original Dracula novel, Professor Van Helsing is the scientist and scholar who uses his wisdom and knowledge to defeat the evil of Dracula.  Its sort of a metaphor of science's victory over superstition.<br/><br/>The makers of the Van Helsing films have taken this character and turned him into a long haired, pretty boy vampire hunter more akin to Buffy the Vampire Slayer than the character for which he is named.  Doing this to Van Helsing would be like taking Sherlock Holmes and turning him into a Rambo like character that blasts Professor Moriarty with machine guns.  I am sick of modern movie makers taking gothic horror stories, situations, and characters, and turning them into amped-up action films.  Now, the one exception would be the Mummy, because they did do a good update to that character, a big improvement over the old bandage swathed skulking villain of yesteryear.<br/><br/>That being said, they could have made an acceptable action based film of this sort, with the Van Helsing character.  You make Van Helsing true to what his character should be (the old, wise scientist), and team him up with a young Hugh Jackman character that is a vampire hunter.  Brains and brawn brought together to defeat the monsters.  But what they did with this film is absolutely disgraceful.<br/><br/>The only good thing that has come out of Van Helsing's release is that Universal has re-released many of the classic horror films from the 30's and 40's to DVD as a marketing tool.  I will buy the old films on DVD.  When Van Helsing comes out on DVD, it will not be on my shopping list."

And so the nightmare began... First off, the script and acting are both terrible. This comes as no surprise, and I expected nothing more. Second-- the special effects were pathetic! I could create better CGI on my home computer! It was so poorly rendered I found it difficult to believe this was a professional production! (Except for some of the Mr. Hyde scene). So, I have to pin my hopes on some good action and directing. Well,  I got neither. There are basically 2 action sequences repeated over and over and over, with I believe 2 pieces of music repeated over and over and over... My god it was so boring! My wife actually had to wake me up saying ""Oh no-- you can't make me suffer through this by myself"" ""But it was you're idea hon-- you're the big Hugh Jackman fan"" I wish I had walked out.

How about the acting which could not have been worse had it been performed by sock puppets. The ""actor"" who played Dracula was less frightening than the Count on Sesame Street. Hugh Jackman simply looks like he lost a bet to appear in the film...and the eye candy vampire brides have all the talent of the cast of any Girls Gone Wild DVD you can find.

"alexgoldfinch","1","5","11","24 November 2004"," A lot of money and a big hat
","This is simply the worst film I have ever seen. It is mind-rotting muck of the highest category, and is written and directed by a man who should at all costs be prevented from churning out any more of this dumb garbage (see also THE MUMMY, and that other polyp on the backside of film-making: THE MUMMY RETURNS).<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is a fine actor and given the right script and character he can be extremely watchable, ditto Kate Beckinsale, but both are wasted here, being given cruelly awful dialogue, and characters with all the depth and interest of an episode of SCOOBY DOO. <br/><br/>Speaking of which I've read lots of reviews on-line by enthusiastic(presumably) 13 year olds who say how great the CGI effects in this film are. Cobblers. It just looks like a lot of money has been spent on creating a lot of very cartoon-like images designed to give the viewer sensory overload and prevent him/her from actually THINKING. Naturally this has much in common with video arcade games, and so those with a mental age of 12 or below are more likely to be impressed.<br/><br/>The biggest offence that this film caused me is the fact that writer/director Stephen Sommers claimed to have been ""inspired"" by the classic Universal horror movies of the 1930's and '40's. Aaaaarrrghhh! This film has NOTHING but the names of the characters in common with masterpieces like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, WEREWOLF OF London etc. These films had atmosphere, great performances, characterization, a sense for romanticism and for the eeriness of the supernatural...all qualities that this excrescence of a film cries out to be blessed with. VAN HELSING has errr...a lot of money thrown at it and Hugh Jackman in a big hat.<br/><br/>I cannot tell you how much I hated the performances - the guy who played Dracula was about as effective a replacement for Bela Lugosi as a pencil would have been. But worse...so much worse was the bloke who played the comic sidekick monk. His barely-disguised irritating Australasian accent didn't help matters, but he just came across as an unfunny moron one just ached to see impaled on one of those silly crossbow bolts that Jackman was firing hither and yon. What did they teach him at drama school?<br/><br/>My abiding memory of watching this putrid rubbish,(and indeed the only happy one of the entire film-going experience)was the roar of laughter in the cinema when Kate Beckinsale's ludicrously accented gypsy got killed and Van Helsing in werewolf form let out an absurd howl of grief. It reminded me of Oscar Wilde's comment on the death of Little Nell in THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP - to paraphrase: it is impossible not to be overcome with mirth.<br/><br/>Terrible, just terrible."
"KryptoniteCornCob","1","5","11","19 November 2004"," Like 'Nighmare Creatures', only crappy. - SPOILERS
","The advertising/marketing of this movie is what eventually reeled me in to finally rent this movie on DVD. The movie looked like it would be slick enough, and have some cool monster action, reminding me a lot of the video game 'Nightmare Creatures'. The difference is is that Nightmare creatures is good. But anyway, wow, after seeing this movie, i see that Hollywood never ceases to keep getting cheesier and cheesier. They have reached a new low in all areas, especially in the form of writing horrible scripts, and the (horrible) use of CGI. I simply cannot put into words how atrocious the cgi in this movie is. <br/><br/>It is so bad that it ruined the entire movie for me. One of the most laughable effects would have to be Frankenstein's monsters' brain, which glows like one of those static balls you can buy in almost any store (the kind you can put your finger on and the static follows it). I can't believe they used CGI for that, i could've bought a static ball, stuffed it into the back of a prosthetic head and achieved a better result. All of the cgi is just horrible, all of the monsters were laughable except for Frankenstein's monster, he was overall kinda cool because he was not CGI and his acting was decent. I hate CGI, but not for what it is, but how Hollywood uses it. They simply do not know what they are doing. The creatures in this movie would have benefited greatly from being physically built. There is never a 'scary' or tense moment in this because of the Scooby Doo movie CGI looking creatures. The flying creatures might as well have been tossing Scooby snacks to the villagers below them. I've seen plenty of bad movies, but this one is bad all around. Bad acting (mostly), HORRIBLE special effects, crappy script, and the movie is way too long for what it is. It tries it's best to be 'epic', but fails miserably. <br/><br/>I have nothing against long movies, as long as they are actually good. This one would have been better off shorter. Fortunately, i wasn't unlucky enough to have seen this in the theater. However a friend of mine has and now i too feel his pain. I'm tired of having my intelligence insulted by going to the theater and always seeing garbage movies. I hear people comment about movies such as this as being 'fun' movies and not to expect much. Well, i am the consumer and i sure as Helsing should be getting more for my money than this crap. And the reason Hollywood keeps churning out this crap is because millions of people keep allowing it by giving them money.<br/><br/>If people would boycott theaters for awhile, Hollywood would try harder. I wanted to like Van Helsing, but, i simply really cannot. I'm kinda depressed now after seeing this heap. But i should've known better, in the days of almost always crappy CGI, and Hollywood being so unoriginal that they actually have to remake movies. In closing, Van Helsing is one of the worst movies i have seen in a while, and it's right up there with Wendigo and House of the dead. <br/><br/>So, unless you enjoy video game(borderline cartoon) graphics as the main attraction in movies, glowing static ball monster of frankenstein brains, stay away from this. If you want some cool monster hunting action, play Nightmare Creatures instead. Hollywood, you need to at least try to polish your turds a little more..because the corn is still showing. I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this 'movie'. My vote: 1 out of 10."

","As a fan of 1) good horror films, 2) Bram Stoker's novel, 3) Murnau, Browning, and Terence Fisher's 'Dracula' takes, 4) Peter Cushing; and having detested Stephen Sommers' 'Mummy' films, and having read all the reviews, I was not exactly in a great hurry to see this film. But I was willing put my purist's taste in the closet, along with my critical faculties, all my higher brain functions in fact, and just take this as zippy moving wallpaper, and finally renting it on the cheap on DVD, I found that even my spectacularly low expectations were not only stooped to but surpassed by this woefully empty exercise in CGI doodling off. The 3-page script I would reckon to have been packed together by a bunch of excitable pre-teens riffing on their favorite Horror and Adventure flicks, but I suspect such kids would have provided more solid characterization and plotting than this thing provides. Firstly Mr Sommers et al toss out everything that was interesting and meaningful about the Van Helsing character and the Dracula legend and fill in the gaps with a lot of agony aunt superhero stuff and a few good ideas (the secret Vatican anti-monster force, the warrior Gypsy clan) that are of no interest whatsoever to them, as they are only interested in layering on effects and stunts, the cumulative effect of which is incredibly boring. Making the heroes nearly as indestructible as the villains - as in the bit where Kate Beckinsale falls about four stories down through a tree's branches and lands with nary a scratch - really helps to make you care and believe in them. <br/><br/>As with many modern movies, it is magnificently shot and dazzlingly designed, but provides no sensual pleasure whatsoever in its technical wizardry. Hugh Jackman does the intense superhero bit surprisingly well and all he requires is a script with lines of dialogue that make sense. Richard Roxburgh I wish would stop playing villains, for here as in 'Moulin Rouge' he goes right off the deep end with a stupidly campy performance. Beckinsale lacks steel, humor, and anything resembling sex appeal; I've followed her career since 'Cold Comfort Farm' and she gets duller by the passing year. David Wenham, the most talented of the three Aussies wasting themselves here, manages to make a couple of lines work with a good comic act. Compare this film to the genius of Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' (from which it steals a steroid-pumped version of the coach chase) which combined old and modern movie tropes so cleverly. At the point when I checked how much of it I had sat through - 81 minutes - and realized it still had something like 40-50 minutes to go, it was high time for the eject button. Abominable."

Dracula's performance borders on parody in the earlier parts of the film, and new characters and plot twists are introduced without any sort of rhyme or reason - see if you can catch such oddities as vampires in the daytime or at least one character who keeps falling into the same cliffside river. As if that weren't enough, the whole thing goes on for over two hours; by the time the final scene rolled around which goes for the sentimental ending, the audience was chuckling.<br/><br/>In short: worse than The Punisher."

","Judging this movie for what it is, a fantasy film, it delivers well with reasonable acting (Kate Beckinsale's accent is even credible), good effects and a story-line writhes around enough to remain sufficiently unpredictable and suspenseful. With its veritable monster-mash of Dracula, his heinous brides, Dwerger minions and deranged servant Igor, as well as Frankenstein's monster and werewolves, all boxes are ticked and the character variety helps the plot from running dry at any point.

","Hugh Jackman in Wolverine-esque mode pre X-Men. He's the vampire slayer Van Helsing transformed, in lurid modern day comic book style, into a superhero, and by the end of the movie he has become a werewolf to boot!
He warms up by fighting a very Shrek-like ""Mr Hyde"" voiced by Robbie Coltrane, who doesn't have to fake a Scottish accent, before moving on to encounter Dracula, Igor, Frankenstein, a Werewolf and Dracula's three Brides.
Leave any treasured memories of the traditional stories you may have at the door, as they have been cannibalised and rearranged almost beyond recognition.
I find this movie very attractive visually, I think the set design, effects and action sequences were very well conceived and executed. The basic story structure is sound enough for me, and all the actors to a fine job.
However they just try to cram in too much action, which comes at the expense of any meaningful character development, and much of the dialogue is disappointing.

It may not be an Oscar contender but it did its job as a popcorn film that could entertain those who don't want to think hard. It's also good for those of you who didn't care for the Mummy due to the casting of Brendan Fraser as the main character. Even though I did enjoy Van Helsing, I hoped that there'd be a better plot.

","Van Helsing (2004) is fun and pretty well made in different aspects. It has good acting throughout by all the actors, especially by Beckinsale and Jackman. Kate Beckinsale really is a great choice for the role she fulfills, she has the correct physical look/appearance, and she fits in all the other ways as well, good cast call. Hugh Jackman is obviously playing the main character here, Van helsing. Hugh also gives a fine performance, and he also physically fits the role, he's very stoic at times but then heartfelt at times when he needs to be, and he's strong/muscular, which of course is necessary with all the action scenes and maneuvers he must perform. Speaking of action scenes, the special effects and the actual fighting in this movie is all very well done, and I don't mean to say that it's the best thing in any action movie you'll see, but it suffices. I also really like the way they did Dracula's wives, seductive and menacing at the same time, which of course is the way Dracula's wives are supposed to be. I thought the plot was entertaining and I thought it was executed well. So all in all Van Helsing receives a seven out of 10 as far as quality goes."

"jon2005","5","2","3","22 May 2006"," Van Helsing
","With The Mummy (1999), Stephen Sommers showed us that he could make a film that had character, plenty of CGI, and was just plain fun. The sequel was not so good  less plot, worse CGI, and not so much fun. So a step down, then. The pitch for Van Helsing must have seemed brilliant to studio bosses: take the three biggest horror characters of the 1800's (namely Dracula, the Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's Monster) and shove them together with a hero who, whilst originally was just a mild-mannered doctor, is now a kick-ass monster hunter. What could possibly go wrong? <br/><br/>I'll tell you. The problem is that Van Helsing seems like a continuation of the Mummy series just with a different story: virtually no character, massive amounts of (not that great) CGI, and little fun. It's yet another step down for the director who, although has proved he's up for plenty of action, cannot put any life into it. Hugh Jackman appears to be the perfect lead for the role of Gabriel Van Helsing, but he never gets the chance to give depth to his character  as soon as he kills one set of baddies, he's off to kill some more. He can handle the action well (but we already knew this from the X-Men films), and could probably handle any real drama that should have been inserted into the film, but the director just doesn't seem to want us to know anything about any of the characters, he just wants to see them fight, which is not enough. I couldn't help but think that if things had been taken a little slower, the film could have been made that much more interesting  less would have been more in this case. It's as if Sommers is afraid to take a breath lest the audience realise how hollow the film really is.<br/><br/>The film was also pitched as a horror/action film, and yet there is not one moment that provides a genuine chill or cheap scare, although it is very dark (it's mostly set at night  I didn't mean atmospherically!) Admittedly some of the action scenes and sets are convincing, and the film does have good production values, but once again it seems the budget has gone towards all the CGI, and not on the script or story. With each film, Sommers seems to include more and more monsters, as if he is trying to outdo his last film in terms of effects. This is a prime example of the ""quality not quantity"" adage, as the more CGI there is, the less real it looks. The action scenes quickly become repetitive and although start off original and good, end up being a bit of a bore. And really, how many times to we have to see the lead characters swing on a rope in front of a castle? It's just not necessary.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a real shame that the film turned out this way. It really needed to be either a slower horror film, or an action film which did not feel the need to rush through at such a pace that the audience are afraid to blink lest they miss something. Stephen Sommers must learn how to do character first, action second, if he's going to keep a fan base going; relying on visual effects alone just isn't enough for us anymore.<br/><br/>Rated: 5/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

I have to say up front I'm not a particular fan of the horror film genre and Hugh was my only reason to watch this. Having said that, I think this movie didn't know whether to be funny or serious so it didn't make it as either. It probably would have worked better had it been camped up a lot more.<br/><br/>The movie looks gorgeous and it certainly had some interesting things in it, but I was bored by it.

For, as wonderful as I liked the acting, the humor (even a hint of a wolverine joke here and there) I felt the action was too ""busy"".  I'm not saying I don't like action, but it felt like there was just too much at once, so instead of concentrating and getting pumped up by the action, I tended to blank out a little from it.<br/><br/>Personally, if it was up to me, there'd have been a little less action, and a little more about Van Helsing's past.<br/><br/>There was however one part of the movie I felt was useless.

I did not mind some of this film, and some of the story, but this movie gets dorkey like Harry Ptter, The Matrix, and Lord of the Rings.  I like the pace of this film, very fast like the Dawn of the Dead remake. When I compare Van Helsing to the Dawn remake the story becomes fantasy/dork and lose a bit of the grit or realism that scares me from the Dawn of the Dead or Chainsaw remake.  This is a good rental, but a little too over explained story line. Should of keep one guessing, and a little more nastier, instead of shocking.

Happily the film picks up as soon as the opening sequence is finished.<br/><br/>On the whole I really enjoyed this film. It looks amazing and the action is plentiful. This film is FUN!!

"matties25","8","2","3","6 May 2004"," Special FX
","A fantastic film, see the special effects and drool, and the imagination and scope of the designers on this film. I enjoyed the film throughout, not sure what age rating it will receive as there are some scenes that are rather scary and I am a 25 year old bloke!<br/><br/>Could have done without the James Bond style refs at the start of the film, and maybe its a tad too long, but the humour in the film balances out the scary parts of the flick. Put it this way it is a far superior film than the League of Gentlemen which is in the same genre, Coltrane's Mr Hyde is excellent compared to LoG! Jackman & Beckinsale are fine in this but don't expect any oscar nominations for either. The support Friar chap is funny, and helps tone down Van Helsings macho bravado.<br/><br/>All in all its not going to move arthouse film lovers in the same way that it will move popcorn movie fans. You get exactly what you expect from the posters, big special fx amazing scenery and location work, a visual feast that takes the vampire hunter film genre up a big notch or three. Look forward to the TV spin off, hope its as good as the film was."

","When the credits rolled on this one, I nearly couldn't contain myself. This is a fabulous film with fantastic special effects, good acting, a strong story, and a first rate soundtrack!  Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Gabriel Van Helsing is fantastic, as is Roxburgh's part as Count Dracula.  Van Helsing's search to find Dracula and complete his mission is not only bold daring, but full of great creature moments and awesome action.  David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) does a great job as the comic relief Friar who aids Van Helsing and Anna in their fight against Dracula and the other creatures they face. The only thing that I didn't care for was the fact that Frankenstein's monster seemed too human, and able to carry on conversations.  He actually seemed to care.  But that wasn't such a big deal.  I found the film completely entertaining and loads of fun!"
"Dragonkind","8","2","3","4 May 2004"," Either too much romance for a horror/action movie, or too much horror for a romantic film.
","Van Helsing is a great movie for horror/action buffs.  The special effects are top notch, and the storyline is easy to become immersed in.  Will Kemp's acting seemed over-dramatic in some scenes, but his role was integral to the plot.  Richard Roxburgh does a great job in his role as Dracula, making the Count an easy character to hate.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale shine in their roles.  However, the gratuitous romance scenes seemed out of place. The cast of characters (monsters) are well though out, and mesh with the story well.  Some comedy is thrown in, but not too much - just enough to get a chuckle every so often. The end leaves something to be desired in my opinion, but this is definitely a movie worth watching!"

The music by Alan Silvestri is superb. The effects are amazing. Van Helsing is meant to be pure entertainment. And on those terms it is great.

There are elements of an Indiana Jones battles Dracula vibe, but not plotwise.  There weren't many slow parts as the action seemed to role right along with the story without seeming forced.

","The film suffers mostly from not knowing what it is - starting with a cold open that is like a lost scene from Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein,"" to something out of a comic book, and finally settling on a weird action comedy vibe where only one person is in on the joke; Van Helsing is absolute mess. Beckinsale and Jackman try their best in roles they had to take before they had the power to choose better ones, and at least David Wenham seems to have fun with his role. It does have some camp value, but that's it.
Still, some scenes with the Count and Igor seem to be crying out for musical numbers. If someone were to remake 'Van Helsing' as an r-rated musical comedy - they'd have a hit on their hands. ""I'm So Hollow"" seems like it was made for song."

"Cineanalyst","7","1","1","10 July 2018"," Dracula Meets the Wolverine
","Despite being thinly scripted in parts, overly plotted in others, and CGI bloated, ""Van Helsing"" might be the best monster-rally movie since the original Universal series, from its initial crossover feature, ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1943), to its turn into self-parody beginning with ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948)--although my favorite may be Columbia's ""The Return of the Vampire (1943), which, akin to ""Van Helsing,"" is a Dracula Meets Wolf Man monster rally in all but name. Albeit, being the best monster-rally fare since the 1940s or so, which has included the kiddie ""The Monster Squad"" (1987), the prior-year's summer blockbuster, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003), and a host of B-to-Z-grade pictures, is not a high bar to surpass. In retrospect, ""Van Helsing"" also plays a bit like a warm up to Universal's subsequent attempts to launch a new Dark Universe, that being ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) and ""The Mummy"" (2017), except that the warm up is actually better than the latter results.<br/><br/>À la ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" Dracula has an evil plan for Frankenstein's monster, but, once again, werewolves (and, it could be argued, some other dimwits) are trying to thwart him. In an homage to the classic Universal horror films, the opening sequence of ""Van Helsing"" is in black and white and rehashes Dr. Frankenstein's creation of the monster, complete with a pitchfork mob chasing them to a fiery climax in a windmill. For a while, ""Van Helsing"" seems rather haphazard in its touching upon other classic monsters, including scenes of Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde (who is more like a mix of The Hunchback of Notre Dame--literally that's his location--and, as in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" a weak version of Marvel's the Hulk rather than the character from Stevenson's novella), of some werewolf hunters and of a small village being terrorized by vampires. There's also some stuff with Igor, a gravedigger, vampire brides and baby vampire bats. Probably the biggest problem with the movie is that it spends time with too much clutter while not delving too deep into the characters and storylines that really count.<br/><br/>Van Helsing merely retains the name of Stoker's character. Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing is no Dutch doctor, but rather an 1880s James Bond type working for Vatican as a hitman of monsters. The friar Carl stands in for the ""Q"" character from the Bond films, as he shows Van Helsing the latest in fictional-Victorian-era weapons technology. Strangely, Carl is also more like Stoker's Van Helsing than the actual character by that name in this movie, as he's the one with all of the answers and knowledge related to vampire hunting. Jackman's Van Helsing, on the other hand, at first, wonders why he can't just shoot the Count with his guns. Like Jackman's Wolverine from the X-Men movie series, his Van Helsing is a semi-immortal with memory loss who recklessly rushes into a fight, relies upon the intelligence of others, whether it be a Carl or Charles Xavier, struggles with the risks between heroism and evil capable from his rage-infused superpowers and with the tragic possibilities of his romantic relationship with a female sidekick, whether it be Anna Valerious or Jean Grey.<br/><br/>As for this movie's Dracula, I'm fairly satisfied with it. I've been watching a bunch of Dracula-related films since reading the novel, and I'm tired of all of the weak or otherwise lovesick bastardizations of Stoker's titular villain. Stoker's Dracula was pure evil. In the 1931 Universal version, Bela Lugosi added camp to the role. At least, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula evokes some of Stoker and Lugosi's traditions, and he's an especially strong vampire. Whereas Van Helsing is a rehash of Wolverine, I can see a bit of the absurdity of Roxburgh's Duke from ""Moulin Rouge!""--which along with the absinthe in the windmill and the visual excess, ""Moulin Rouge!"" seems to have especially influenced this movie. Mixed with the goofiness throughout from director Stephen Sommers, who had already done likewise in rebooting ""The Mummy"" series, this one can be fun. The Frankenstein monster, on the other hand, was somewhat of a sympathetic character even in Shelley's book, but he's overly such here. No explanation is given for his eloquent speech, either; even the classic Universal movies, for as much as they departed from the source material, addressed his acquisition of language.<br/><br/>The visual effects are well integrated with the the framing and its movement--what is traditionally done with the camera, but which is increasingly being done by computers. Only a few years later than ""Van Helsing,"" five movies that relied heavily upon computers for their imagery, ""camera"" movement and lighting were seemingly-oxymoronically awarded Oscars for Best Cinematography: ""Avatar"" (2009), ""Inception"" (2010), ""Hugo"" (2011), ""Life of Pi"" (2012) and ""Gravity"" (2013). ""Van Helsing"" is part of a prior generation of combining live action and CGI and camera and digital photography, but at least the ""camera"" moves some, including following Dracula as he walks up walls (much more casually than the wall crawler of Stoker, by the way) or keeping abreast of the vampires flying in their humanoid-bat forms. Such a sense of the role of the camera in the mix of live action and CGI was lacking from the prior year's monster rally, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" so ""Van Helsing"" was certainly an improvement upon that, delivering an action movie that's actually visually enthralling.<br/><br/>(Mirror Note: Dracula displays his and other vampires' lack of reflections to Anna as he dances with her before a mirror in a vampire ball sequence that somewhat recalls a similar scene in Roman Polanski's ""Dance of the Vampires,"" a.k.a. ""The Fearless Vampire Hunters"" (1967). A mirror is also used in another scene as a gateway.)"
"samzzz-69448","4","1","1","22 August 2017"," What a waste of potential
","In light of Universal's lukewarm attempt at kicking start their planned Dark Universe earlier this summer with the underwhelming The Mummy reboot, I was suddenly reminded of Van Helsing, the supposed big budget summer season starter of 2004 for which the studio must have carried similar hopes, but ended up way short.<br/><br/>With the Mummy reboot, one could lay blame chiefly on the chaotic script which was beyond salvageable, not to mention Mr. Cruise himself allegedly spent months in the editing room after principal shooting. Cruise also brought his long time collaborator, Mission:Impossible writer/director Christopher McQuarrie to help with the script during development. Yet with a script like that, there was not much veteran playwright but first time blockbuster director Kurtzmann could do. With Van Helsing, it becomes harder to throw blames around.<br/><br/>Do you blame the incoherent and totally predictable mess of a plot to the badly written script? I suppose you could. Do you blame the million or so clichés and bad dialogue on the script, too? I suppose you could. Do you blame the absolutely horrible, laughably bad fake Eastern European accents uttered by Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxborough (just about the least menacing or scary villain they could have come up with), and David Wenham (whose sidekick character is the antithesis of funny) and over the top dramatic acting on the director? Again, I suppose you could. Since the film is written and directed by the same person, riding on the success of the two Mummy films, I guess that means you can just blame him then?<br/><br/>Yes and no. Universal's decision to put so many of their classic monsters into one popcorn summer movie with no clue whether it is supposed to be a horror, or fun action-adventure so it ended up being neither is also part of the problem, and a major part at that. The idea of making several solo origin movies first, and if these were successful, then make an ensemble tentpole obviously wasn't so hot back in 2004. Would the film have done differently if it were to come out 10 years later, under a director director? I doubt that too, seeing how The Mummy 3, The Wolfman, Dracula Untold and finally Tom Cruise's The Mummy turned out. It's totally understandable for Universal to be obsessed with their classic horror monster IPs, in the same way WB never seem to be able to let go of the classic folk legend IPs such as Pan/Jack the Giant Slayer/King Arthor that have caused them mostly flops. I'm sorry to say this, but Universal genuinely seem clueless at developing their horror monster IPs, ever since The Mummy returns 16 years ago.<br/><br/>Credit where it's due, the production value is excellent, which is to be expected given the large budget spent on making this film. The big CGI hallway sequences is no faker than The Matrix Revolution in late 2003, the female vampires are a bit awkward through my polished 2017 glasses, but other than that, the technical department have done their jobs superbly. There really isn't much that haven't been said about why the film's bad, on the other hand. The 'horror' aspect consist of only jump scares and very little else, and even Jackman's title character, the only one in the story not terribly underwritten, seems to lack in any kind of flavor so even Dr. Van Helsing becomes a bland and generic hero, one without an origin sub-plot or even a character arc. Where is the crisis for him, what is at stake here on the most personal level? The end of the world if Dracula is not stopped? I'm sorry but that's not good enough. Even the romance subplot feels forced.<br/><br/>(Not to mention this film started Jackman's unfortunate ""holding my dead love interest in my arms while howling and sobbing in great pain, and doing all this topless"" roles which was repeated 2 years later in X Men: The Last Stand.)<br/><br/>Ironically, Alan Silvestri's soundtrack proved to have enjoyed a far better shelf life than the film itself. Song's from the score was used all over TV, includin multiple times during the peak years of the world's most popular car show, Top Gear. Hearing the Van Helsing soundtrack while watching super cars race through southern Europe is pretty funny.<br/><br/>I agree with the 5-7 star reviews saying Van Helsing is great, mindless silly fun, I do. When the title Universal logo turns black and white and morphs into a burning torch, I was epically excited in my seat, expecting a truly scary film with a grander story than the Mummy films. Needless to say, I was immensely disappointed. I don't give out 8-10 scores easily, and 5-7 is my usual mark for a passable product, hence the score of 4 here, indicating disappointment."

This is one of those films, mixing Dracula to Frankenstein's monster. Even Dr. Jekyll (and his alter-ego, Mr. Hyde) enters the movie! This is not new, has been done in other films and works well when it's done carefully, but definitely wasn't the case here. The script is confusing and makes an attempt to transform Van Helsing, originally a Dutch professor with taste for the occult, in a kind of good supernatural entity destined to hunt down and kill evil monsters. Sorry, but the way this character ended up being ""deconstructed"" was wrong. The director/writer could have made other more interesting options like keeping Van Helsing more faithful to Stoker's novel and try to frame him in a story in the current time, perhaps. The truth is that this film is a clear script error, resulting of flying imagination of its director/screenwriter.<br/><br/>The actors were good in their roles, without surprises or special highlights, except perhaps Shuler Hensley, who played a character far from the usual monster, in constant psychological conflict because of his horrid appearance and inner humanity and goodness. The accent of some characters wasn't well done and if the idea was to make them closer to the Romanian universe (when is usually located Dracula's Castle), it failed and became them more humorous than they can be at certain supposedly dramatic moments. The setting, costumes, makeup and sound, visual and special effects are too imaginative, like coming out of a Marvell comic or a graphic novel. The soundtrack, despite the good performance, also didn't stand out particularly.<br/><br/>This film is well seeing and entertaining, but doesn't bring big surprises or positively impresses the audience.

","Van Helsing (2004): Dir: Stephen Sommers / Cast: Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh, Kevin J.

Van Helsing is seen as a murderer because he hunts vampires, werewolves, Mr. Hyde, Barney, etc. He is joined by a woman whose brother was bitten by a werewolf. Director Stephen Sommers previously brought us The Mummy so handling action and big overwhelming special effects are to his advantage. Screenplays are not his strong point as The Mummy proves as does this film. Hugh Jackman plays Helsing as a reminder of his Wolverine role. He is given the background but not the followup and rapidly descends into action and combat scenes. The same thing with Kate Beckinsale who basically replays her Underworld role. Again, the background is there but the familiarity decreases chances of the role being unique. Only Richard Roxburgh as Dracula is remotely interesting along with Kevin J. O'Connor as the loyal Igor. Samuel West plays Dr. Victor Frankenstein who is only featured briefly. Only hard core comic book fans will truly appreciate this combination of monsters with special effects that pay off better than anything else in the film.

"vip_ebriega","5","1","1","12 September 2009"," VAN HELSING: Monsters, action, horrible script.
","My Take: A dumb, but visually-stunning adventure with some neat action and some truly terrible dialog. <br/><br/>If there's a weakness I have, it's how I keep changing my opinion on the movies I watch. I saw VAN HELSING back then, sort of liked it then forgot much about it. Since I have a vague memory of VAN HELSING since then, I just dismissed it as the CGI effects-laden mess that everyone else called. But upon seeing it again a few weeks ago, it fared much better than I expected. If I wrote about VAN HELSING back then, I would have given it the 3 stars I'm giving it now; It's enjoyable and occasionally exciting, but still pretty silly and quite forgettable.<br/><br/>I didn't really grow up with the old Universal monster movies (these movie are even older than my parents are!), but their impact is undeniable. Whether or not you have seen all of those original B&W classics, you are maybe living under a rock or something if you don't even know who Dracula is. These guys are the big leagues! Our generation is grown up on movie serial killers and soulless slashers who have none of these immortals' depth or class; You can actually find something to identify with in these monsters. And here they are, all together in one movie, like a greatest hits collection strewn together like a Frankenstein's Monster. VAN HELSING's great B&W opening alone is a great homage to the classic monster movies and probably the best moment in the entire film.<br/><br/>The rest is pretty much standard action-with-CGI fare. Van Helsing, an intelligent old hero in the old Dracula classics, is turned into a comic-book action hero here (played by Hugh Jackman) complete with gadgets, a comic-relief sidekick, a secret organization he works for (a secret Vatican organization with more James Bond 007 references you will ever need in a movie) and the girl. But regardless of his presence, Jackman could have done so much more to the role. The movie was pure intentional camp to be sure, the least Jackman should have done is to add more humor and edge to the character. Worse still is Kate Beckinsale (a fine actress, need I mention) who plays vampire hunter Anna Valerious. She shares very little chemistry with Jackman's Gabriel Van Helsing, while an adventure movie of this kind could have done so much more. Then there's the CGI, superior and all, is just a bit too overcrowded at times. Did the movie really need a CGI Dr Jekyll/Mr. Hyde? And don't get me started on Dracula's screeching overbearing wives who turn into flying bat-like creatures (which makes me wonder if the real actresses who played them weren't CGI characters themselves!).<br/><br/>Director Stephen Sommers of THE MUMMY pictures could have made another purely enjoyable blockbuster, but this flawed, silly yet marginally entertaining one lacks the charm of his previous works. One thing I do remember enjoying in VAN HELSING is the action, and they're still pretty gripping this time around. Sometimes though, I wish that Sommers realize that CGI without a lot of fun in them are just lifeless. And that script, bleh! <br/><br/>Rating: **1/2 out of 5."
"I_Love_Spielberg","8","1","1","23 June 2009"," A very underrated Stephen Sommers film
","""Van Helsing"" is about the famous vampire hunter in his earlier years. During this time, he is working for the Vatican, and he doesn't have any memories about his past life. His next mission, in this film, is to travel to Transylvania to kill the infamous vampire Dracula in order to prevent the Valerious family, who have been trying to vanquish Dracula for years, from slipping into purgatory. While in Transylvania, he also faces some other classic movie monsters: Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man. <br/><br/>I have to say, I liked it back when I first saw it in 2004, and I still like it to this day. It's a fun movie to watch, like the ""Mummy"" movies. Hugh Jackman is really good as Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale is good as Anna Valerious. But the person who steals the movie is Richard Roxburgh, who plays Dracula. He really gives an interesting edge to Dracula. He not only makes him romantic, but he also makes him like Dracula is in the Bram Stoker novel...in that his goal is to make more vampires. <br/><br/>Now, bear in mind, there are some things in this movie that could have been done better, such as the Van Helsing character himself. Sommers doesn't fully explain how Van Helsing forgets and remembers certain things from his past life. Also, you don't really care for the Van Helsing-Anna relationship that is in the movie. It's sort of one of those things that are like, ""You know...you two don't make a very good couple, so don't even try."" Other than that, it's still a good movie."
"TheLittleSongbird","4","1","1","23 June 2009"," Nice images, but the film on the whole is entirely uninvolving.
","Van Helsing does have some excellent sets and costumes, giving a dark macabre feel and some dark cinematography that was quite possibly the best thing of the film. I also liked the haunting music, and was on the whole impressed with Hugh Jackman in the title role, very brooding at times. Richard Roxburgh, despite some very cheesy material was good as the count.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these were the only redeeming qualities, to a film that is overall disappointingly uninvolving. What I mean by that, is that there isn't much of a story, which was too many times clumsy and unfocused. The dialogue was eye-rollingly cheesy, I think the count's lines were the worst. I wish I could give some examples, but I can't remember any of the dialogue. The performances were okay, Hugh Jackman certainly acquits himself well, and perhaps the only actor to rise above the challenge. However, Kate Beckinsale seemed to do nothing but act pretty, therefore a rather uninvolving character, and consequently there was little chemistry between her and Jackman.<br/><br/>Overall, some good moments save a rather bland and uninvolving film, that also suffers from being overlong, that could have been much more with some better dialogue and a better story. 4/10 for trying.

But I can watch it any time and still be entirely pleased by the time the amazingly spiffy credits roll around. You don't go to see a movie like this with the same standards in mind as going to see 'The Shawshank Redemption' or 'The Godfather', and nor should you judge and review it as such. I went into theatre with a taste for popcorn, iced tea, and campy thrills and got everything I wanted.<br/><br/>One thing that got my attention was that it's clearly designed to be a throwback to the equally campy old B-horror movies of the 30s-50s, a genre I love. This is best showcased in the black and white prologue. And let's face it, those films aren't revered for their realism. <br/><br/>The action was unlikely, to say the least, and to say the most, awesome! The dialogue was cheesy, but funny and enjoyable, and occasionally quite witty. The plot was suitably far- fetched. Overall the effects were breathtaking - seems to me that if someone hates a film they will automatically trash on the effects regardless of their quality. And the casting, regardless of what you thought of the performances, was next to perfect.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see something that's going to make you think, ponder the human condition, take a reflective walk round the block, this film isn't for you. But if you want to curl up on the couch with your girlfriend and just watch a fun movie together, I'd wholeheartedly recommend Van Helsing!<br/><br/>My humble opinion is yours for the taking."

","This movie clearly follows the cliché of the league of extraordinary gentlemen, with monsters standing in for heroes: the initial scene is no other than a mr. Hyde chase. However, I suppose the main goal of this movie is to pay a close homage to Universal 1930s horrors...many scenes, motifs and settings are literally copied and it's IMPOSSIBLE to appreciate the movie without having first watched EVERY classic universal horror movie. Without the proper frame of reference, it all becomes a garbled hodgepodge that only borrows the worst from the league of extraordinary gentlemen; for example the topic of a ""cure for the werewolf"" has to be understood in the light cast from numerous old horrors. Van Helsing appears as the wrestler UNDERTAKER (check beard, hat, dress ) in his WWF 1980s version. There are elements coming from too many movies to list: Ring of the Nibelungs is one, James Bond (the underground experimental lab). Well, this is a visually stunning SFX extravaganza, not a theater play, so it has to be taken for what is worth: I for one like the 'victorian sci-fi' angle... Acting: there is not much to say, but I found actors did a fine job for this kind of movie. Ah, check the princess doing acrobatic moves on stiletto heels!"

He's aided by the Vatican and its secret stash of monks, who do nothing else than make weapons for killing the forces of dark. Van Helsing is assigned to go after Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and a young monk Carl (David Wenham) is ordered to go with him as a tech support. In Transylvania he gets help from Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), of whom family the Dracula has wowed to kill off, and surprisingly enough the creature (Shuler Hensley) that Frankenstein made.<br/><br/>This all leads to sights and action that makes no sense in any level with the exception of entertainment value. And that really is how the film should be seen: nonsensical piece of pulp entertainment. If you start to expect some real values form it, like sense or plot or good dialog, you are certainly watching a wrong film. But it you don't mind a highly illogical film, that causes you to chuckle for its own silliness, well, you just might enjoy this ride.<br/><br/>This film, I thought, did far better in its genre than some other films, like Sky Captain.

Thats for the Castlevania players, in which both of them, frank and wolf, make apparitions in various parts of the game. By the way, I was waiting for a mention about the Helsing-Belmont's clan relation, too. The most of the people that watched the movie with me didn't know about the long story between this two characters. And maybe thats why I fall in love with the big fight. I was waiting a lot of talking between them, and cross traps, and holly water spurts, like the Bram Stocker version (that is a great movie, too), but I had a truly good outcome, instead. Its a shame that the makers couldn't get more funds for best special effects, best costumes, best weapons and all that stuff. A project like that, must be very well done.

","When you want to make one more film on Dracula who counts several hundred films already, both as assets and as drawbacks, you have to be original. No problem ! Let's patchwork together dozens of allusions to other films and create the first ever vampiristic salad. So Dr Frankenstein and his creature will be there. The use of the lightning to get electricity like in Back to the Future 1. The use of strange weapons halfway between Back to the Future 3 and The Lord of the Rings. The costume, dress, apparel of Van Helsing looks like Clint Eastwood's in a spaghetti western, and at times like the main hero's in the Matrix trilogy. The cows in the village are similar to those in Salem's Lot 2. Even the dance scene with the vampire reflected in a half empty mirror is borrowed from Dance of the Vampires. I would need a volume to quote them all. So what's left after all that composing of tidbits? A superhero Van Helsing who kills Dracula's three fiancées, the thousands of baby vampires that look like upside down Aliens in their suspended pods, and Dracula himself. And all that on the order from the Vatican, the Pope and the good old godly Catholic church. That's a counter-allusion to the Da Vinci Code. The film then is more dictated in its plot by the brand new topnotch state of the art digitalized image processing of the modern world than the reverse. So the plot is a vast ballet between mountains and from abysses to cosmic skies. It is thus an amusing entertainment as shallow as the Thames River twenty kilometers before its spring.

"johnnyboyz","5","1","1","30 September 2007"," Universal Horror for Dummies.
","It would seem that when Kate Beckinsale is taking time out from fighting vampires and werewolves in an Underworld film, she's...........fighting vampires and werewolves in a Van Helsing film. In fact, that pretty much sums up not only four years of Kate's career but also the film of Van Helsing as a whole  a film that makes numerous mistakes yet makes up for it in the form of feel good, guilty action; a film that is loud and brave yet is incidental and one tracked. Director Stephen Sommers successfully re-invented another Karloff classic in 1999 by name of The Mummy; this was followed by a fun but not as good sequel called The Mummy Returns and then by a real piece of entertainment/trash called The Scorpion King. Right at the very beginning though, Sommers himself played a directorial version of Dr. Frankenstein and meshed together two 1970s action films called Alien and The Poseidon Adventure to create Deep Rising  another one of his failures. This final example is rather relevant to Van Helsing since it's a re-invention of Universal's classical era monsters.<br/><br/>A lot of the content in Van Helsing just feels copied, either from an older horror film or something else. The opening scene is rather insulting to the 1930s Frankenstein films, the scene in which Van Helsing (Jackman) is introduced to the gadgets and his overall mission is reminiscent of a James Bond 'Q' and 'M' scene and the whole film in general just feels like a cross between 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'Shrek'. I feel sorry for the people who hadn't seen any Universal horror films before they saw this. I really enjoyed Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein from the 1930s  even Branagh's 1994 version was outgoing and experimental (although it just 'felt' poorly made in the end) but Van Helsing as a film is just a dumbed down version of a would be franchise waiting to be re-injected at a time of big budget, CGI fun-fests. Yes, I 'got' the references to previous films: when The Monster states 'Friend!' and when the 'It's Alive' quote is muttered at the very beginning but the film is so dumbed down, we need to be 'reminded' that Vampires don't like sunlight; that Werewolves need to be killed with silver bullets and that the full moon transforms them  no doubt newcomers to these villains will be in awe: ""Wow! That's a really cool  they thought of everything."" True, only these are 70 year old concepts you're gushing at.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from within in the form of blatant mistakes and a poorly structured narrative. First, the character of The Monster is more reminiscent to that of an opera singer given the way he is almost singing his lines like a tenor rather than mumbling through the film in true 'body parts made form dead men and the mind of a murderer' fashion. Also, during one scene Anna (Beckinsale) jumps off a walkway onto a rope above a boiling pot of chemicals when two enemies are coming for her: why the hell does she do this? The two foot soldiers are small and beatable yet she does the tricky thing and jumps onto a rope. She ends up defeating them on the rope anyway but it seemed a pointless excuse for an action scene of some sort. Secondly; after a carriage chase through the woods at night, the very next scene is daylight as one character consoles another on the ground yet the flying woman/vampire bat is exposed to it on the cliff-edge. The fact the film switches from night to day so quickly AND has the vampire in the daylight is laughable. Again, a poor excuse for an action scene of some sort and the scene where the sidekick solves everything towards the end in about a minute was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is really just a film for the people who missed the first Universal horror franchise and if they do decide to track down the 1930s and beyond films then they'll probably be disappointed with them which in a way is sad and unfortunate. The effects are good and the fight scenes entertaining in a way but it's nothing more than a Deep Rising of Universal Horror."

Like Underworld, it deals with vampires, werewolves, and monster hunters with hi-tech weapons, and like Underworld, it generally cares more about those things than plot or characterization. However, while I was able to enjoy the first Underworld as a stylish comic book good time, Van Helsing gets so lost in a storm of wall-to-wall action and cartoonish CGI that it's usually more disorienting and confusing than thrilling or exciting, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever.

"Ithorianjedimaster2","4","1","1","24 May 2007"," Stephen Summers' career is still rolling in werewolf poop.
","When the first trailer of ""Van Helsing"" was released, a lot of people got excited. Seeing Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman on the big screen once again as well as Hugh Jackman playing the fabled monster hunter Van Helsing, it looked as if the movie would have launched Stephen Summers' career. Well. . . maybe not so much.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" was another tribute to the classic monster movie and though it did very well in theaters and DVD, it still wasn't the best movie out there. ""The Mummy Returns"" received less praise than its predeccor, and finally, ""The Scorpion King"" was just a shot-in-the-dirt, an odd prequel that only confused viewers, instead of giving them an insight on the past of the villain from ""The Mummy Returns"". Finally, it boils down to ""Van Helsing"", a tribute to three of horror's greatest creatures.<br/><br/>Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is in a predicament. All of Europe wants him dead, thinking he's a murderer. That's due to when all the monsters he kills turn back to their human forms and leaves him 'red-handed' in the point-of-views of the authorities. Well, after a job involving the capture of Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing comes back empty-handed, having killed Mr. Hyde (even though he changed back to Jekyll at the last minute and made Van Helsing's reputation as a murderer stronger), and within minutes, he is shoved into another mission to Transylvania to aid in the destruction of the notorious Count Dracula, who has been terrorizing the people there for centuries and Van Helsing must help Princess Ana in the hunt for Dracula, but it won't be easy. Dracula is on the search for Frankenstein's Monster, having killed the doctor (a mistake he regrets). After the monster disappeared, he and his 3 brides, along with Igor (who betrayed Dr. Frankenstein), are searching from the monster's whereabouts. Dracula also has a leash on the Wolf Man, which he uses to try and kill Princess Ana.<br/><br/>It's an interesting concept. All the monsters mix into the story well, as do Van Helsing who is practically in his environment. Yet the story lacks character development, and most of the little character development goes towards Van Helsing and his forgotten past (even though he never finds out about his past and the ending just leaves you hanging). Princess Ana is basically the female love interest for Van Helsing and she doesn't do that much fighting, despite her attempts to. Carl (David Wenham) is the comic relief, using the ""Actually, I'm not a monk. I'm a friar"" excuse to get away with swearing and to get a girl into bed. Princess Ana and Carl, along with the other characters in the movie, save Van Helsing, are all suffering from little development, so you don't become connected to the characters and the movie becomes . . . just a movie, not the action-packed careers-improving film that Stephen Summers hoped for.<br/><br/>In terms of music and CGI, fantastic. The technology in ""Van Helsing"" however is kind of out-of-date. It's the 1800s and Van Helsing is sporting an automatic crossbow that shoots metal bolts, as well as two hand-held buzz saws that also seem a little out-of-place in the world ""Van Helsing"" takes place in. There are also times where things are just awkward, such as when Van Helsing is protecting Ana from the three brides of Dracula, he can't seem to hit them with his crossbow on ""automatic"", but he hits his target when he switches to ""single fire"" and he seems to do it with relative ease. Then, there is the matter of the werewolf transformation to and from a human form. The Wolf Man literally rips off his own skin, exposing the alter ego underneath, but in a showdown against werewolf Van Helsing and Dracula, Van Helsing doesn't go through his phase one time and instead, just makes a quick transformation that is a bit out of the concept.<br/><br/>The acting is well done, but it is clear that Kate Beckinsale is struggling to get her career back on the right foot. After ""Pearl Harbor"", she went into whatever movies looked like they would please the audience, therefore get big bucks in the process. That hasn't been doing so well. She either starred in pure flobs, ""Underworld"" and ""Underworld: Evolution"", or movies that just didn't make it to the top 5 in Box Office, ""Click"" and ""Vacancy"". Her role in this movie stands out because she is the only actress that looks as though she isn't fully into character and is just going by whatever script in going through her head. She also has the fakest crying I have ever seen. Plus, Kate just can't seem to have her expression change much, a problem faced in the two ""Underworld"" movies, and even when a werewolf is stalking her, she acts calm and emotionless, because everyone knows there is nothing frightening about being hunted by a 7-foot-tall Wolf Man. Hugh Jackman, as well as the other actors and actresses, are all perfect in their roles, even though those roles still fall a bit short in spots.<br/><br/>""Van Helsing"" was tailed by ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", then ""Hellboy"" and after the downpour of other box office movies that came after it, it was quickly left in the dirt and just couldn't seem to get Stephen Summers' career out of the werewolf poop. Try again, Stephen."

","Steven Sommers apparently wasn't satisfied with jump crapping on The Mummy. Now, he takes some more of the most beloved suspense tales and turns them into a cheap, comic book like movie. None of them are given any kind of adequate screen time or development, they are simply there for name value. What ensues is one of the more ridiculous summer movies in recent memory, like Hudson Hawk, except not funny. There are even some painful James Bond references, such as a monk who gives Van Helsing state of the art weapons.

Were he only as succeessful in ""Van Helsing"" as he was in ""The Mummy"", and heck, even the mediocre ""Mummy Returns"".<br/><br/>What's not working in Van Helsing? Well, first the titular character has no descernable connection to Abraham Van Helsing, one of Dracula's primary foes in the Bram Stoker novel. I'm convinced Hugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine, but the same cannot be said about Van Helsing - both heroes don't know their past, but with Van Helsing, no one really seems to care.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale is a tremendously beautiful and gifted actress. Unfortunately, she's saddled with a thick Translyvanian accent that would give Bela Lugosi a run for his money. About midway through the film, Beckinsale seems so frustrated with the consistency of the accent, she seems to just drop it - which is a considerable mercy.<br/><br/>The same can be said of the film's werewolf - it begins life an fearsome and furry CGI creation, but by the end, the producers don't seem to be trying, and the werewolf, much like the movie, seems to be in full video game mode. By now, the werewolf has lost most of its physical weight and all of its bite.<br/><br/>Roxbough's Dracula and his brides seem to be bi-polar. Apparently realized he's no Gary Oldman, Roxbough compensates by freaking out a lot. He's not really that scary.<br/><br/>Igor looks like Gary Busey. He's really that scary.<br/><br/>So what is working in this film? David Wenham's Carl, Van Helsing's aid. And that's really the only reason this film got a high a rating as it did."

I know, the plot is somehow dedicated for a younger audience but still uses elements from Horror movies from the 50's or 60's.

","Either the original script for this film was awful, or the writing was mangled while in production or during the editing process, but in any case the final affect is the same: The story arch and dialogue is the equivalent to what a fifteen year old might come up with for a Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Don't get me wrong; I was fifteen, once, and still play D&D, but I expect a little more from movies. If a film doesn't provide a plot more complex than the flight of an arrow, or dialogue more realistic than a video game (except in the case of ExistenZ), it's most likely going to be a disappointment in my book (unless it matches the sheer primordial success of The Matrix). The plot is an interesting one, but it's criminal to have packed such a fine collection of classic monsters into a single plot that has been so hamfistedly presented.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is beautiful to look at. The art direction and effects are fantastic, and made me believe that this gothic fantasy land could actually have existed at one time. It gives the movie a style and beauty all its own, and if this were an arthouse film, that would be enough. However, there is supposed to be a story, here, and the telling of a story needs more than just a cool plot, and a nice looking presentation.

","Well, it was yet another Sunday afternoon and I had just watched the Breakfast Club, so I was in the mood for the movies and some good acting. Thus I decided to try out the new Hugh Jackman-movie, Van Helsing. Good. I hadn't much expectation anyway, believing that it would be yet another nicely done action film similar to the Mummy. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. I don't know when it hit me (probably when the heroine in the high heels opened her mouth to speak in that weird, completely unnecessary accent), but suddenly I knew that this would be a film focusing on the impact of the special effects rather than the plot outline. I wasn't exactly expecting Shakespeare, anyway, but there were some things that made an ""old"" movie buff like me cringe: -There were hints at some deeper involvement between Dracula and Van Helsing, as well as his role in the ancient history of Transylvania , but somehow, all was badly explained. -There is no way one can understand why Van Helsing was, like, 400 years old, being human. He was human, wasn't he? -If the people in Transylvania were speaking their own language, why did they bother putting on that preposterous accent anyway?<br/><br/>-Why didn't Van Helsing have that accent(from what I know, he was German anyway), if he lived there 400 years ago? What did he do in the meantime? How did Anna know about him? Was she speaking English? -Did anyone else notice how often the heroine was hurled against rocks, spun around, beaten up and God knows what else without breaking so much as a fingernail? And in the end, Van Helsing throws her on the couch and she just dies out of no apparent reason. It struck me funny and I wonder who thought of that lame ending for her after she'd proved to be unbreakable.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the main character curiously reminded me of X-Men's Wolverine: his charming, innate grumpiness, his quest for recovering his memories, yadda-yadda-yadda. I can't imagine I was the only one who noticed that. All in all, Van Helsing is a movie packed (over packed) with action, wonderful special effects (which are becoming tiresome, to say the least), a hilarious, sneering villain and a great sidekick... but absolutely no story. It is cliché after cliché and appallingly shallow. Nice for a Sunday afternoon, but I wouldn't watch it again... ever."

But, creatures like Frankenstein's monster and werewolves have no purpose in a story about Van Helsing, a VAMPIRE hunter. And the usage of Dracula is overrated.

There's far too much rope-swinging, but the vampire creatures are pretty cool and the werewolves are pretty cool, if unnecessary to the movie. The acting is bland, and the script is pretty laughable.

Even if I were a kid.<br/><br/>In my mind the themes I found interesting had to do with evil forces within beauty, revealed in very frightening and sometimes uncontrollable ways. Some characters show a bit of the conflict within - vampiress controlling a cat-like nature to pounce, with jaws distorting to an elongated state. (This chilling effect reinforces how cats really are more frightening at closer inspection of their long fangs!) Also, the werewolf was not able to contain his animalistic changing nature - even among friends! Frankinstein's monster also touched on the polar opposite - the hideous creature is beautiful inside. Although done before, those timeless ideas offered the best scenes of the movie, frightening and sad. I thought that the credits at the end were creative and artistic.<br/><br/>The worst parts include clothing for Van which seemed like it was taken from the Indiana Jones set (as well as the character), a gadget prop scene ala James Bond ""What can this do, Q.?"", and for Anna that typical vampire-fu, back-flipping Buffy the Slayer action!<br/><br/>I would have liked it more if the movie had battled in the mind, not so much visually, and left the viewers figuring out how things connected for themselves.

","While I can't say I'd nominate the leads in this film for Academy awards in their previous roles, (XMen & Underworld) I did enjoy those films. Ditto both Mummy films, which I thought were carried more by the cast's charisma than the FX or the less than stellar writing. So I was optimistic about this film.<br/><br/>I hate it when I'm disappointed. This film has very few redeeming qualities. I had thought that the second Mummy film had pushed the cartoonish action limit about as far as it could go. Wrong, it can go farther, but it shouldn't have.<br/><br/>This film would have been much BETTER if they had spent $50M less on FX and $100K more on a single talented writer. And the same amount on nearly any other director.<br/><br/>This completely cliché', wholly unoriginal and derivative weird mishmash of steam punk, vampire, werewolf, James Bond and superhero film is ... a mishmash. It has all the appeal of a cold plate of goulash combined with cabbage and ice cream, all topped with mustard.<br/><br/>So, given its name, I think one can best sum up this film by saying, it sucked!"

","Van Helsing is all smoke and mirrors.  It uses tremendous amounts of ""shock & awe"" to hide the fact that it doesn't have a compelling story or interesting characters.  The whole experience was similar to watching someone play a video game for roughly 2 hours.  I also felt that this particular movie was suffering from an identity crisis: it could never decide what kind of movie it wanted to be.  Is it a comedy?  Is it horror? Is it drama?  It was, quite simply, trying to do too much with too little story to back it up.<br/><br/>This movie was _almost_ bad enough to make it into a good movie (e.g. Troll II, Deathstalker III, etc), but, unfortunately, it also failed in that regard.<br/><br/>* spoiler *<br/><br/>What's the deal with Anna's (Beckinsale) family appearing in the clouds at the end of the movie?

Then, when Anna and her family appeared in the clouds at the end of the picture, people laughed so hard, you could hardly hear the end of the movie. This movie was that cheesy. It was sad, as my husband and I were both so excited to see this movie. It was the first date movie we've seen in months. Very sad. I would not waste my time on this movie again. <br/><br/>We won't be buying this movie, we won't see any sequels, and we wish we'd chosen to find where Hellboy was playing so we could have at least seen something that was ranked as good. We'd give this movie a 3 out of 10. Even the CGI was so fake, and so contrived, it just didn't bring the movie up in our esteem at all. And we love Hugh Jackman and just purchased Kate Beckingsale/Wiseman's movie ""Underworld"" and love her in that. <br/><br/>We'll see future Underworlds, and will probably even buy Hellboy sight unseen, but will never see this franchise again.

","I went in search of a good movie and came away with something a good deal less. Be assured, the sequel will not show up as every famed monster that Hollywood has ever exploited is already dead by the end of this one. It boasts a cast of fine actors but Stephen Sommers seems to overlook the fact that special effects must support and add to a good story, otherwise it's a video game. In The Mummy the ineptitude of most of the main characters along with a tongue in cheek script carried the day. Here Gabe Van Helsing is a serious man in search of serious things and vampires appear out of the woodwork at the throw of a switch. It's as if they were hired out at great cost and had to be used to justify the great expense. In the end we grow weary of the scrapes that our hero and heroine get in and out of. The only thing to offset the gung ho heroes is the comic touch of David Wenham ( formerly seen as Faramir) as an inept sidekick. It could all have been so much better."

If you were to ask me, I would say that the peak in<br/><br/>photorealistic CGI was probably back in the mid-90's because the<br/><br/>FX were only used where they had to be.

","This movie was so hyped up and the trailers was pretty good so i looked forward to a really cool movie with action, great effects and cool one liners from Hugh Jackman. Well there was action, and the effects was pretty cool but that was about that. The story itself is kind off weird and poorly done and the dialog couldn't carry the mail. I had to high expectations for this movie and that is what ruined it for me. I like Hugh Jackman and his role as Wolverine in the X-men movies is the only reason to watch them in my opinion. The worst scene in the movie is when Anne is hanging in the rope and has just received the antidote from Carl. I mean, look at the expression on her face... It is either hilarious or just stupid. I rate this movie 5/10"

","If you see the trailer, you see the whole idea of the movie. That may sound bad, but can be a good thing if you are into cartoony specialFX-ladden, none-to-serious action movies like Batman, LXG, The Mummy Returns or even the James Bond Franchise. Don't see this film for the plot, which is mediocre at best, just enough to carry the arrangement of specialFX. See it as a fun cartoon, only done with real-life actors instead (at least some, as at least 50% of the cast actually are CGI). One serious warning though: The film tries very hard to be cool, but often overdoes its own themes. Some scenes are just pure ridiculous and seem to be straight out of a spoof like Scary Movie, but generally the film is as much fun as a themepark ride capitalising on proven, non to surprising but well done shock and awe FX (I especially think that the Werewolfs were done very well, far better than in the horrendeous ""Underworld""). On a special note, I have to say I liked the hints to H.Jackman's Wolverine Character in his Werewolf scenes (the claws, the bad temper...)

I don't know what some folks were expecting with this film, but I was only looking to be entertained, and entertained I certainly was.  This is escapist stuff not an art house movie.  Sure some of the dialogue could be better and a bit more could be done on character development.  The CGI could also have been improved, Mr Hyde anyone? But overall its fabulous fun. The action is pretty much non-stop and the film is visually stunning for the most part. Okay so there's no deep meaningful plot. So what? Can anyone tell me what the great plot was in ""Lost in Translation""?  I still enjoyed that film too, but it never got slaughtered like Van Helsing. If you're looking for some arty movie with depth and substance, save your money.

"rbsjrx","8","1","1","7 May 2004"," Not bad, despite what's being said
","The early reviews for this are all over the map, with lots of pans. I frankly don't get it. Let's face it, folks, the progenitors of this film were B movies long before they became ""classics"" of the horror genre. As such, they endured decades of critical scorn before being appreciated. Will this achieve the same fate? Probably not, but it's not the turkey everyone is saying!<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I'm a boomer. I grew up with high-concept silly movies and learned how to adopt a mindset to appreciate them. Shoot, I was even able to find fun with ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (LXG) which was, by any measure, a much worse movie than this.<br/><br/>The tactic here is relentless action which sweeps you along without giving you too much time to think of what's illogical (other than the mere existence of vampires, werewolves, et al). Is some of the action silly? Sure. But is it entertaining? It can be if you let it. Aside from the obvious derivations, there are, as others have noted, quotes and homages from a variety of other films. Those are fun. There is comic relief, mostly from David Wenham but also from Hugh Jackman himself. Is the heroine totally implausible? Duh, of course! But that's part of her job. Classic horror films have two types of women - crones and bimbos. Since there's no one comparable to Maria Ouspenskaya these days, we have to just settle for the babe.<br/><br/>I rated this 8 out of 10. It's good mindless entertainment that pays due respect to its origins. Where it falls down is both at the very beginning and near the end. In the beginning, there's a sequence with Van Helsing and Mr Hyde/Dr. Jekyll where Mr. Hyde is every bit as overdone as in LXG. At the end, the temptation once again becomes too great and the climactic battle is between CGI creatures. Well done, but a bit disappointing. The very end of the movie is its Achilles heel - it's a real downer and probably hurts the word of mouth for the show.<br/><br/>Should you see it? If you liked ""The Mummy"", you may well like this. Just don't be too swayed by the critics. Many of them were wrong about the original Universal horror films, as they have been later over other FX-laden films. Especially if you're of boomer age like me, you may find yourself having a pretty good time with it."

","Going into this movie, i was extremely excited at the fact there were 3 fantastic and very talented australian actors in it. Being Australian myself i felt a sense of pride to see the movie due to an Australian having top billing in a hollywood blockbuster. And i must say if it wasn't for them i would not have made the effort. i saw the movie last night and was extremely disappointed with what i saw, visually it was a stunning movie, the cgi they used looked very good, but that all fell down at the fact that there was no story! if there was, i'm still trying to find it.<br/><br/>The movie had a lot of monsters and characters with out really introducing them properly, and the audience was left wondering why they were in fact there. im still not sure what kate was doing there! i really didn't think that she fit in with the rest of the cast, also was she meant to have some sort of ""super power"" as she is the very slim figure of a women who gets the absolute s*** kicked out of her in some scenes and then she would jump up and run off with hardly a scratch???<br/><br/>The three aussie boys, Hugh, David and Richard did very well and brought to life their characters even though they were written so badly. David as Carl was great, although if the character had of been written better there could have  been endless possibilities with what he could have done with it. For me Hugh Jackman was a stand out, this man is charming, he can act plus he can sing and dance like peter allen, all in all he is perfect! and the scene where he rips is shirt off, is a must see for any female!<br/><br/>so overall i think this movie will go well in australia due to the casting, but i know that i would not have gone to see it if they weren't in it. 8/10 because of hugh, david and richard but take them out and it is about 5/10!"

"zorn24601","8","1","1","8 May 2004"," A treat for fans of the classic monsters...
","As a fan of the classic monsters from the old Universal Studios films, I was probably bound to enjoy this film no matter how bad it turned out. If you're a fan of the old films...Lugosi's 'Dracula', Karloff's 'Frankenstein', and Chaney Jr.'s 'The Wolf Man', and all the myriad sequels...you're apt to like this film, and see its flaws as forgivable. After all, the old films, particularly the ones from the 1940's, were far from perfect.<br/><br/>And there are flaws. The plot is overwrought, the acting by many of the supporting roles is at times wooden, the Wolf Man (I refer to Velkan; there's more than one werewolf in this film) doesn't have enough screen time, and some of the fight scenes (especially near the end) go on way too long. And the second scene of the film (with Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde) is completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>However, when this film is on, it's on in style. The opening scene is hard to top; the creation of the Monster, Dracula trying to take control of the Monster, an angry mob chasing the Monster to an old windmill, and the pathos of the Monster as the windmill burns, all in black and white as a beautiful tribute to the classic films. The portrayals of Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster would have made Lugosi and Karloff happy; their signature characters are handled as though they were directing Roxburgh and Hensley themselves.<br/><br/>If you aren't a fan of the old classic monster movies, you probably won't be too impressed with 'Van Helsing'. However, as long as you go understanding that this is a popcorn film, a movie to enjoy with your higher brain taking a snooze, you'll like it. It's just as much fun as Sommers' Mummy films.<br/><br/>
And if you are a fan of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr., this film is an absolute blast. Do not miss it.<br/><br/>8/10 stars if you like popcorn films, probably 5/10 otherwise."
"UMWolvie2442","Null","1","1","7 May 2004"," HUGE Disappointment - WAY over the top & VERY Dumb
","This movie was EXACTLY like watching a two-hour video game.  How old was the person that wrote this script?  I know you don't go to this type of film looking for a deep plot or even a believable story but you at least expect coherent entertainment. From the opening fight scene with Mr. Hyde through the end of the film, there wasn't one single moment when you bought in to the CGI chaos that was depicted on the screen.  When severely underdeveloped characters are flying around and defying every law of physics, you're never allowed to get involved in the movie on any level other then the `cool cartoon' level (and quite frankly very few of the jerky CGI cartoon creature scenes were that cool).  I could literally list the WAY over the top, unbelievable cartoon moments but that would fill up an entire page. The sad part is that most of the CGI monsters looked really fake. From Hyde to the baby vampires to the vampire women, they all looked extremely cheesy. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are exceptional actors but were so stranded by this script and by the stunts that it almost hurt to watch them floundering on screen from one fake backdrop to another.  The hambone that played Dracula threw so much over the top cheese at EVERY single line he delivered that my arteries hardened just watching him.  To call this film a disappointment would be an understatement.  I was greatly looking forward to it because of the concept, the cast and the obviously huge budget.  It's such a shame that they threw this much talent and this much money behind a script written by someone's pre-teen child.  I guess I should be asking myself why would I expect anything remotely intelligent from a movie that was directed by the director of The Mummy & Mummy Returns?  I'd say next time I'll know better but there won't be a next time for me sitting through any more of this guy's movies."

","It's not a great movie, its not Citizen Kane, yet Van Helsing is very much more watchable than Citizen Kane, no offense intended to Orson Welles. Its a ridiculous movie, as much homage as it's camp, but all the time action scenes dominate- Van Helsing is like a James Bond movie where he fights MGM classic monsters. It relies too heavily on CGI although in comparison to any of the Transformer movies, Van Helsing shows restraint. It's a stupid movie, cartoonish in both character development and plot, but as a whole miraculously works. The secret to what makes Van Helsing so watchable- the movie is of no significant moral or social value. I pray they make a sequel, Van Helsing 2 Dracula's Revenge!"

","Wow, what can I say? Let's start with for me a 6 is a very mediocre rating. <br/><br/>It has a great look and it was a great idea and that is where great and this film part company.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is fine as the title character as is most of the cast the notable exception being Richard Roxburgh as Dracula who brings back memories (okay nightmares) of Jeremy Irons in Dungeons and Dragons. He takes overact in places to an extreme level and never strikes you as anything other than a caricature. <br/><br/>The effects are over done and in some cases really really bad. Apparently, nobody associated with this picture has any idea of the capabilities or limits of the human body. People are thrown through walls, bounce off trees, and undergo huge falls all seemingly with little or no ill effects. I have no problem suspending disbelief to an extent, but man you can only disobey the laws of physics so many times without me losing interest.<br/><br/>The story carries itself for awhile, but falls apart about half way through and the movie ends up being a series special effects. <br/><br/>The abilities of the vampires seems to vary from moving at nearly the speed of thought to merely near human speed when it comes time to kill them. The Frankenstein monster has a great look, there is also a neat take on Mr. Hyde, the werewolves are fine (over done transformation scenes), and the vampires look cool (expectations being Dracula's fine battle visage and the unhinging 'Predator' jaws when they go to feed at times).<br/><br/>I wasn't much of a fan of the ending either.<br/><br/>My recommendation if you are a fan of the genre rent it for a $1.00 otherwise pass. It certainly is not the quality and doesn't have any of the mass appeal of ""The Mummy"" or ""The Mummy Returns""."
"bob the moo","Null","4","9","27 March 2005"," A noisy effects show lacking tension, excitement or even fun; but then I guess some sections of the audience love that sort of thing
","Under the direction of the church, famed monster hunter Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to protect the remaining Valerious family and assist in their battle against the forces of evil in the country. Once there he discovers that only one member of the family remains alive; luckily for Helsing though it is the gorgeous Anna, who fights monsters with a sexy sneer and a pair of rather tight trousers. Never having fought a vampire before, Helsing soon finds himself fighting the original Dracula, who has a sinister plan involving the use of a werewolves and the late Dr Frankenstein's research into tissue reanimation to achieve his aim  but can he be stopped before it is too late? About six months or more before this film came out in the UK, film magazines were salivating over the cool posters featuring Jackman posing in a long coat against a Gothic, shadowy background; as usual hyping an unseen product. However immune I would like to think I am to hype I was quite taken in by it and starting to look forward to the film but, approaching release and having seen clips from it, I decided it wasn't something I would bother with and decided to put it off until I could get it in my own house without any effort. So it was that a cold evening after a tiring day at work saw me settling down to veg out in front of this film, assuming that it would give my brain no problem at all. I was right in this regard but I had really hoped that the film would not be the noisy effects show without atmosphere or tension that so many critics had claimed but sadly I found out that they were right. The story is less a narrative and more just a collection of set pieces and I never really got into the story and the attempts at subplots (such as Helsings past) just came over as filler rather than stuff I cared about.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said that this is clearly a Steven Sommers and that that is no bad thing and, although I agree with the former, he is wrong about the latter because this is at best, an average thing thanks to Sommers. I guess if The Mummy and its sequel are your idea of wonderful films then this will probably do you but for me the action (and story) was just messy and lacking anything of interest or any style that was imaginative; the rule of thumb seems to be when you have a quiet minute in the film then just make some more stuff fall down/go on fire/explode etc. This approach robs the film of atmosphere, genuine tension and genuine excitement at almost every turns. The occasional jump due to things moving suddenly are lazy and easy and don't make up for a real good product with depth. As a cinema fan I did think it was a nice idea to pay homage to the Universal monsters but this was not the way to do it as not of them are really done justice. As with many Sommers summer blockbusters, the effects are always good but never seen to fit in with the real action, by which I mean they always look like, well, effects  again taking away from the excitement of the film because I can get into it when it seems so very artificial. Delivering a good atmosphere would have helped but Sommers is rather one-note and he cannot do this at all.<br/><br/>The cast swagger around the best they can, striking poses and jumping around the best they can without really having depth or character to work with. They seem to have been left to work it out for themselves and, as with much of the ""real"" stuff in the film, they don't convincingly fit in with the effects. Neither do they convince on the action front, but that is less their fault than the fault of the action that requires them to be thrown around like rag dolls with no consequences. Jackman is a good leading man but he cannot do it without help and here he has no script, director or anything to help him  he is cool and has presence but that is all. Beckinsale has a nice body  and by noticing that I am only doing what the film wanted me to do with her performance, use it as teenage boy fodder; she has no character and I saw close-ups of her bum in tight trousers more often than I saw anything approaching a performance. Wenham provides by-the-numbers comic relief but Roxburgh's Dracula is poor even if his ""brides"" are good looking. Of the monsters the only one to make an impression was Frankenstein's monster, who was interesting and not just the roaring effect that the others were.<br/><br/>Overall this is noisy, has lots of rather soulless special effects, an uninteresting plot and characters, attractive women and quipping heroes; for many this is all they seem to demand during summer months to pass as entertainment but I couldn't help feel that, amongst all the noise and sweeping sets that someone had forgotten to produce the fun and excitement to go along with it."
"Ronin47","1","4","9","8 June 2004"," Worse than I imagined (1/2*)
","""Van Helsing"" could very well be the funniest movie of 2004. The only problem is that the parts that are SUPPOSED to be funny aren't funny at all, and all the parts that AREN'T supposed to be funny are hysterical. This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays the famous titular character (who I don't believe was ever envisioned as a swarthy superhero, but oh well), who is sort of like the James Bond of whatever century this is set in (I didn't care enough to notice). He has gadgets, works for the Catholic church, and goes around killing monsters. <br/><br/>While the original character of Van Helsing was only after Dracula, this Van Helsing also fights Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, and in the first horribly bad scene in the movie, Mr. Hyde (who is shown here as a sort of ultra fake-looking giant pudgy caveman). <br/><br/>There are simply too many idiotic parts in this movie that I couldn't possibly recite them all. There's Kate Beckinsale's ludicrous ""gypsy"" accent (""Ze Frankenstein monsta!""), Richard Roxburgh (who was great in ""Moulin Rouge"") playing one of the worst Draculas in movie history, the terrible ""brides of Dracula"" (one of them taunts Van Helsing with the devastating grade school put-down ""Too bad. So sad!""), the dopey comic relief, the complete over-use of (badly done) CGI... I could go on and on. And I haven't even mentioned Jackman bounding around in a loincloth, or the ""funny sidekick"" played by David Wenham who I was dearly hoping would get killed.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there are some pretty nice sights here and there, of mountains and castles and such. All completely fake of course.<br/><br/>Some movies can be dumb in a smart way (like the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies), or at least dumb in an entertaining way. ""Van Helsing"", though it certainly has enough unintentional laugh-out-loud moments to make it slightly bearable, is so dumb and so long (almost 2 1/2 hours!) that it ends up draining the energy from you instead of giving you a surreal good time, like the best ""bad"" movies can do. <br/><br/>Combining all the classic monsters into one film is a nice idea, but it was already done in 1987, in ""The Monster Squad"", one of my favorite horror movies as a kid. That movie was much scarier than this piece of crap, and was INTENTIONALLY funny. So rent that instead."
"merindo105","1","4","9","14 May 2004"," Mmm, I didn't like it *Spoiler alert*
","I apologize for all typos in advance! Again, this review contains many spoilers, so please don't read if you don't want to know. And, I really didn't like the movie, so there are a few (many) things in here which could be considered as mean. So, again, don't read if you cannot handle emotional criticism. The movie really frustrated me.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour, take the money you save for the ticket and treat your friends to dinner. Seriously, that was a bad movie. Period! Maybe I should stop here, mhhh, no!<br/><br/>If it was meant as a bow to all the classic movies, they failed. A bow honors and maybe nodds with a twinge of irony but it does not try to copy. That is really the thing, they tried too hard to make it exactly like the classics but seemed to be very undecided if it should be parody or a serious remake. They took all the classic elements, threw them into a blender, fed the mix to a worm plagued dog and made the shit that came out into Van Helsing. (*that would be the mean part on my side)<br/><br/>E.G. Dracula's brides were neither sexy nor overacting in a way that would count as a parody, they looked like the director dragged some gogo girls out of a cheap table dance bar and told them - be sexy, scary and uh, dunno, whiney?? And they did, except they tried to be that all the time and at once. The scene where V.H. gets his weapons is not even James Bond, its a Triple X copy except that it lacked the self-irony of the last mentioned. (and I grant XXX here more than it deserves, in my eyes)<br/><br/>Here is my next question: was there a script?? If yes, please, Sommers, do the world a favor and transfer to stock exchange or tax attorney. I'm just trying to help. A plot somehow shined threw about one and a half hour into the picture but dissolved circa thirty seconds later. And the fact that I can't even remember what the plot thingy was, stands as a comment on its own. It seemed to me they cut together scenes from the classics without really thinking that it might puzzle or in my case bore the audience to death to see somebody or something falling from impossible height into a broad stream which happened about every fifth scene, they gave wolfie hell that way, but Igor got his share in the end. Now that I think about it, the movie would be perfect for a drinking game: take two drafts everytime somebody or something falls from a great height, take three if it falls into water. You would be dead drunk after an hour.<br/><br/>Speaking of plot, Dracula's castle. The only entrance was in the gipsy's house and except for D. and his brides the rest were unable to fly. I wonder how they got the equipment to the place without looking a little suspicious. I see the track of little helpers trampling through the house: ""Hello"", ""Hello"", ""Sorry about your carpet"", ""Hello"". And you know what, if they had made it like this, I would have considered it funny, but they didn't. There were so many holes in the story, it makes a mash shirt look warm and cozy.<br/><br/>
Dialogue *sort of: ""Thank you"" says Kate Beckinsale's character, with way too much make-up marring her otherwise pretty face, and the monster goes ""AWWWWWW"" with a look on its mask, that may have meant ""Aw, nice"" but somehow felt like ""Aw, kick in the nuts"". Which leads to the absence of, well, acting really. The actors either were to busy wondering ""How the f*** did I end up in this crappy s***"" or looked like ""Have to fire my agent"", I got this notion everytime Mr. Jackman's character fired his gun. And wasn't that character build up nicely or what: The Arcangel Gabriel lost his memory of who he is and turns into V.H., monster killer for all religions in the world and turns wolfman, kills his arc-nemesis and his lover *tackle - oh my, she  is dead awhooooooo - I laughed so hard* and than lights up a funreal fire, like a beacon in the night. And than came the clouds.. and I fell off my seat positively hysteric by then.<br/><br/>I seriously hope the pay checks were obscenely high otherwise - go kill yourself or buy a shirt which says: ""I was in Van Helsing and can still get a job in the industry...You want to touch me? I'm a miracle.""<br/><br/>
Granted, you don't go and see a picture like that for fine acting or the plot. The Special effects were in fact nice,.. except it was too much. Why did they even waste money on actors at all? And sorry, but if there are actors I expect at least some sort of acting and some sort of plot - both were hard to find in V.H.<br/><br/>Not even David Wenham who was the only one who really tried and did good, could turn this movie around into a passable parody. I'm sorry for all lovers of the classics and I'm certainly sorry for the fine actors who were wasted in this crap. And I'm really sorry because I was forced to waste more than two hours of my life which I will never get back."

","I've got a soft spot for Stephen Sommer's Van Helsing. Yeah its basically a theme park ride put on film, and Hugh Jackman is about as appropriate and qualified for the role as a stick, but there's something shamelessly fun about the way it sheepishly tosses just about every golden age monster movie character it can think of into the mix, resulting in quite the chaotic two hours of CGI, perplexing plotting and trannsylvanian accents worthy of Count Chocula. It's so ambitious it even throws in an extended Alien reference near the end, and one has to admire that. Jackman plays a youthful, athletic version of the crusty old vampire hunter, introduced to us in a London opener in which he's pursuing a rambunctious Dr. Jekyll/M. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane). Soon he's whisked off to darkest eastern Europe with his monk sidekick """" (David Wenham is a hoot) to investigate vamps, werewolves, monsters and all kinds of ooey gooey stuff. There he meets Anna (Kate Beckinsale), the shapely leader of a clan of monster hunters, whose brother is the leader of a pack of werewolves causing trouble in the area. This all leads to eventual confrontations with Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) and Dracula himself played with hammy rock star glory by Richard Roxburgh. It's all topsy turvy stuff and Director Sommers clearly struggles with making it a cohesive result, but where he falters he makes up for it by making it knowingly schlocky fun with just enough camp to elicit a twinge of nostalgia for the monster flicks of yore."

This movie has everything a good fantasy adventure needs: exciting action scenes, amazingly lovable franchise-worthy characters, amazing soundtrack, great costumes, great humor, a cool story and an AMAZING ending. Sure it has some flaws, but they are minor. If this movie was grittier and held on more tightly to the many moral and philosophical themes it touches upon for just a moment, it would have been the greatest monster hunter movie ever made. But even as it is, it is still one of the greatest. I am a lifelong fan of fantasy and have probably seen every movie in the genre and i can say that, in a sea of films that try to cash in on established characters by trying to do needless and terrible''reboots'', or films that are all but mediocre, this movie shines true as an example of how fantasy adventure films should be made. It will forever be one of those films that should have had many sequels."

The film sure went far into putting in great detail. To the actors, creatures, and the story line, Van Helsing was planned to be a great fantasy movie. This movie is highly recommended to people who love fantasy, action/ horror movies. The shots also add to the greatness of the movie.

I can't get started on examples because there really aren't words to explain how ridiculous the action is and this review would get bigger than it deserves to be.

","I think this movie was quite miserable because:<br/><br/>The story was lame, predictable and sometime really melodramatic. The actor choice for Dracula was bad, Dracula can't look or behave that way. And the big problem I have about this movie that it completely ridicules mythology: I know a lot about mythology and old horror classics and I would study it if it was possible and I can say that this movie had a lot of mistakes. Like that you need silver against Vampires -> no you need wood, silver is against werewolves and Vampires can't transform into harpies or walk on walls or make children, this is just ridiculous to me... and that were just 3 examples out of maaaany... <br/><br/>Also what I didn't like was the huge number of special effects... there weren't so much scenes without them ... and these effect weren't done really well ... not for a 2004 movie.<br/><br/>The tension was almost on the same level for the whole movie.. low<br/><br/>and also Bram Stoker's idea of the character van Helsing gets completely ridiculed because in the original he was just an old Doctor who found out what Count Dracula was and how to kill him..... And now people will think of van Helsing as some kind of comic-style Vampire Hunter... <br/><br/>What was good: Hugh Jackman, though for the first minutes I couldn't stop laughing over his hair....

"moonmonday","2","3","6","4 July 2009"," Elements of Good, Execution Completely Lacking
","I am probably different from many in that my first exposure to Van Helsing was in the animation The London Assignment. It was a steal, so I picked it up and gave it a watch, with low expectations. But I found myself interested, so I thought I would finally watch the film that spawned the animated prequel.<br/><br/>It is rather astonishing to me, actually, how a 30-minute tie-in prequel could be so many leagues superior to its big-budget Hollywood source material, especially when there is so much rich material to draw from. Then again, that may have been the chiefest problem: whereas The London Assignment focused solely on a single adversary, the film tries to incorporate so many things and so many moments of homage that it never finds a focus.<br/><br/>The first and most inexcusable aspect is that none of the protagonists are even remotely sympathetic or enjoyable, and no real effort is made to convince the viewer that their plight is good, just, or correct. When the inevitable betrayal comes later, it is not unexpected, but it also fails to carry any emotional weight whatsoever. There is really no effort put into a setup or premise, which makes the film's narrative extremely weak. If the viewers don't care anything about the supposed heroes, why should they care if they fall into danger? The mindset of 'monsters are evil and should be destroyed' was weak in the 50s, that golden age of monsters and aliens in film, and it certainly has not weathered the half-century after. Just as Van Helsing and his crew are not sufficiently heroic or sympathetic, Dracula and his are not sufficiently villainous or unsympathetic. If anything, because of the willful ignorance and hatefulness of the villagers, the Frankenstein Monster makes a compelling argument against the supposed 'heroes'...which is another moment where the film falls flat when it is supposed to have a more emotional impact.<br/><br/>When the heroes meet with hardship, why should we care? They have already caused great torment and sadness for the supposed villains, and for no legitimate or justified reason. It also rather presumptuously sets forth that this bizarre melange of beliefs promoted by the 'holy knights' in the Vatican are entirely true and right, which is a bit much to take for granted, especially with a diverse audience.<br/><br/>Honestly, few of the performances are bad in this film. This is a fantastic cast, and Hugh Jackman does the best with his very weakly-written role. It doesn't hurt that he's particularly nice to look at, but good looks and acting talent cannot help a disastrously poor script and questionable direction; it has been mentioned before, and accurately, that Van Helsing is essentially a series of action sequences barely strung together by the faintest hints of plot.<br/><br/>The characters should have been more defined, and then we might have a reason to care about them, or at least to be concerned if one will survive the current encounter. With a running time of over two hours total, many superfluous and needless scenes could have been eschewed in favor of some modicum of character development. That this is the same man responsible for the generally enjoyable Mummy revival series is shocking to me, since those films were such a considerable step up from Van Helsing.<br/><br/>CG special effects were also, as elsewhere noted, grossly abused in this. While they were quite good, they were overused and made the whole affair look too dependent upon the effects, rather than the proceedings being augmented by them. Any longtime horror aficionado will tell you, it isn't the effects, it's the atmosphere. And even though Van Helsing was not really a horror film -- more an action movie with Gothic horror elements -- it lacked on so many counts, ambiance included.<br/><br/>Essentially it was as if someone had thrown a bunch of well-known features of well-known horror or supernatural figures and roughly blended them to create a film. The plot only moved by grace of the script, not through logical progression or narrative development, and it constantly contradicted itself. The characters were bland at best, despicable at worse...and those were the heroes. The villains at least had centuries of literary heritage behind them. But the heroes were unsympathetic automatons, spewing rhetoric that was clear the actors did not share in conviction. Still, the antagonists were not nearly convincing enough in their opposition and managed to make little impression themselves.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a work of wasted potential. Too many irons in the fire made this a chaotic mess that rarely made any sense and never managed to be as compelling as it should have been. How is it possible that a 30-minute animated video tie-in got it right, but the 2-hour-plus Hollywood blockbuster fumbled it so badly? If you really want to give this concept a try, watch The London Assignment and give this a skip. It's just not worth losing two hours of your life that you will never get back. There are so many more deserving films out there."

","Gabriel VanHelsing (an immortal, younger, less educated Abraham VanHelsing) and Kate Beckinsale must fight vampires, werewolves, Mr. Hyde, and some weird little creatures that are like Jawas with gas masks... can Hugh Jackman still kick butt when he's not Wolverine? I liked this film, but hate myself for liking it. The plot was cheesy, the CGI was overwhelmingly bad, the characters all exhibited some sort of infinite gymnastic skill and luck on landing (apparently they always roll a 20 on their balance checks) and the target audience was clearly rather young. Especially because of the CGI, this was a film I should have hated. My friend Jason says he read a review that claimed Troma could make a better film... and it was probably true.<br/><br/>What I liked was the fact it was so over-the-top. Once or twice and I would have been ""yeah right"" but doing things to the extreme fifty times made it one of those ""so bad it's good"" films for me. Also, I think this is by far Kate Beckinsale's most alluring role. (I think she plays a similar character in ""Underworld"", which I haven't seen, and I imagine that's comparable.) The use of the Frankenstein story was well done. The Dracula story I think was more of a stretch, and why VanHelsing had to be completely re-written from the Stoker version I don't know and don't support. So many aspects of this film reminded me of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" with the combination of old characters and the futuristic weaponry. But, I think this film might have sucked less. Maybe.<br/><br/>Would I watch it again? It's possible, if only to get a better second opinion now that I know what's to be expected. But it frankly was not a good film, and there's no way to convince me that it was. We have received much better from Hugh Jackman... let's do hi ma favor and pretend this one never happened."

","watching this flic I hardly ever found myself on the edge of my seat; it's never really funny or suspenseful or shocking or whatever. films of this kind simply steal from other movies and try to enhance the experience by giving ""more of the same"" plus pumping up the volume. Here you've got the Frankenstein monster, Dracula, and Mr. Hyde teaming up in a story that makes no sense at all. You wonder what this actually is all about. If you want to see a good horror spoof go way back to Roman Polansky's _The Fearless Vampire Killers_ - now taking the enormous production value that went into this movie it is really a shame how little comes back to the audience. But this movie has no point. It's loud, it's always in motion but it never gets off the ground."

","Oh dear, Stephen Sommers. Having hit the big time with action adventure ""The Mummy"", Mr Sommers is a living example of the law of diminishing returns. ""The Mummy Returns"" is a distinctly so-so sequel and ""Van Helsing"" barely scrapes over the low standard set by Sommers' wet 1998 disaster movie, ""Deep Rising"".<br/><br/>So what's so bad about ""Van Helsing""? After all, Sommers managed to plunder the movie legend of ""The Mummy"" pretty successfully, so he knows how to breathe new life into a stale old genre. He's a pretty good screenplay writer and a good director, and the production design of ""Van Helsing"" screams ""Quality"".<br/><br/>Well, er, that may be part of the problem. It looks like a big chunk of the budget went on props, sets and locations, judging by the lack of big name stars in the cast list. Hugh Jackman does well as the eponymous hero but he doesn't get much support from the rest of the cast. Poor old Richard Roxburgh tries so hard to be Dracula but is too subtle to be noticed in anything but the fight scenes. Samuel West is cruelly wasted in the far-too-brief role of Victor Frankenstein. David Wenham twinkles occasionally as Van Helsing's friar sidekick but his mannered performance is drowned out by the movie's excesses. Kate Beckinsale proves that she can act pretty well, but is sidelined by her character's improbable costume and ludicrous stunts. Much like Rachel Weisz in ""The Mummy Returns"" and Carrie Ann Moss in ""The Matrix"", Beckinsale's role in ""Van Helsing"" is merely Eye Candy with Weapons and Martial Arts Moves.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale's costume demands a special mention. Somewhere between Trinity and Mad Max, she is trussed up in buckled thigh boots and bodice for the whole picture. Despite looking like she's ready for a night at the Torture Garden, she manages to run, jump, leap, fall and fight like a commando. This demands a suspension of disbelief akin to bungee jumping without a bungee.<br/><br/>Yup, that's the main problem with this movie. It demands too much from the viewer. The plot is something to do with Dracula using werewolves and evil German dwarfs as henchmen in a plot to use Frankenstein's re-animation process to bring a vampiric horde to life. Having despatched Mr Hyde in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to help Anna Valerious, a gypsy princess whose family have been battling Dracula for 400 years. Got all that? There's more besides. The plot is thrown at you by the bucket-load, then you're swept into another action set-piece before you get a chance to work out what the hell is going on. <br/><br/>The action sequences start off as adequate but quickly plunge into the realms of disbelief. It's almost as if you can see the CGI budget ebbing and flowing during the course of the picture. Mr Hyde is pretty well rendered, but the flying vampire brides look patently fake. The demonic vampire offspring get too much screen time and their interaction with the human cast members harks back to the Time Before Harryhausen. The coach-and-six jumping over the ravine looks OK but the idea of a horse-drawn vehicle leaping 50-odd feet is preposterous. <br/><br/>Mr Sommers needs to take a step back from this movie and work out where it all went wrong. Even more so than with ""The Mummy Returns"", he over-reached himself in terms of plot and special effects and allowed his cast to be swamped in the resulting deluge. As he's due to have a stab at re-inventing ""Flash Gordon"" in the near future, I hope that he gets his ""The Mummy"" mojo back sooner rather than later."
"mattbaxter72","3","3","6","24 December 2006"," Everything that's wrong with Hollywood
","Yes, I know that's the kind of comment usually reserved for polo-necked film students when they're discussing anything that doesn't have subtitles. But I don't even own a polo-neck, and I think I can prove my point, that Van Helsing represents the reason that a lot of people don't bother with big-budget Hollywood movies any more. So, in no particular order:<br/><br/>1. No plot. Now come on, writers are cheap, at least in Hollywood terms - even the legendary Joe Esterhasz only got about five million per movie back in the day. So couldn't someone have told Stephen Sommers that it was time to lay down the pen and let someone else write this? That way, we might have got a plot that made the slightest bit of sense. And don't tell me that doesn't matter - that might be true if your name is Monty Python, but this is trying to be a fairly serious movie, and half the time even God couldn't work out what was going on.<br/><br/>2. Characters. Movies work better with characters that we care about, rather than boring, one-dimensional tortured heroes/heroines, cutesy sidekicks and cardboard villains. I've seen all these characters before, and I didn't care about them the last time, either.<br/><br/>3. Dialogue. In seventy years, we've gone from 'Creatures of the night - what sweet music they make' to 'We are both part of the same great game, Gabriel! But we need not find ourselves on opposing sides of the board.' And that line was ripped off from The Man With The Golden Gun anyway, which brings me to....<br/><br/>4. Recycling. For paper cups it's good, for movies less so. The movie starts with Frankenstein's monster, which is about right, since this whole film is about seven other films stitched together. There are bits of Bond movies, bits of vampire movies, bits of everything you've ever seen, just about. Original ideas? Nah, sorry, we're out of those. Have some leftovers from old Hammer Horror movies instead. Defenders of this movie will likely claim that this is Stephen Sommers paying a homage to movies of the past. It isn't. It's him grabbing great big handfuls of past movies and stuffing them into this unholy mish-mash.<br/><br/>5. Pointless CGI. Lots and lots and lots of CGI. And then some more. Even in scenes that don't need it at all - for example, Mr Hyde didn't need to be a ropey-looking CGI giant, he could have been just Robbie Coltrane, only made a bit larger. You know, like the Harry Potter movies did it. Instead we had one of the most unconvincing fight scenes ever. CGI only works if it's used in the service of a good story, or if it's genuinely jaw-dropping stuff. Neither is the case here, and that's true of way too many recent movies.<br/><br/>6. Cracked actors. Good lord, but there are some bad actors around these days. The two leads here are as good as they can be with this kind of material, but the support are often dire. Special mention goes to David Wenham, as the cute joke character who made me want to kill him after about seven seconds, and particularly Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. You have to see Roxburgh's performance to believe it. There simply aren't words in the English language to describe how shatteringly bad it is.<br/><br/>7. All action. You are allowed to have scenes between action sequences to do stuff like characterisation, scene-setting, that sort of thing. Van Helsing just goes from one action sequence to the next, with maybe a few minutes of Basil Exposition-like waffle in between, and then.... hey, werewolves! I'm sure 12 year old boys everywhere loved this movie, and since Hollywood seems to believe that everyone in the world is a twelve-year-old boy, they'll keep making crap like this. You could have had ten Brokeback Mountains for the price of one Van Helsing, but as long as people keep coming to junk like this, Hollywood will keep making it. In the end, the market works, and audiences get the movies they deserve. Unfortunately."

","I must admit, I wanted to like this film. I like Hugh Jackman, but Kate Beckinsale is absolutely wooden in this. The CGI made it more like a comic book than it probably needed to look. This film suffers primarily from its inability to decide whether or not it is self-aware (like the Mummy and the Phantom) with making jokes and asides, or with being dramatic (as in Coppola's version of Dracula). This Dracula seems too campy and not quite sinister. Switching back and forth was a huge mistake.<br/><br/>The second problem with this movie is that too much is borrowed or sampled from other movies; too much Bond, too much imaging from the aforementioned Dracula. The high tech weaponry looks cool the first time out, but gets old quick. Much of the existing scenery is overblown as well, castles all out of whack with symetrical design and utility. They would have been better off sticking to formulaic horror movie. Someone call me when Anthony Hopkins plays van Helsing."

And hate it I did, but it's gone beyond just mere distaste. I've carried the seed of loathing for it in my heart, and that seed has borne a bitter fruit. No longer can I burden myself under the diseased weight of Van Helsing, I must vent my bile and share.<br/><br/>Mercifully, parts of it have faded, or failed to encode themselves in the first place upon my memory. I have no recollection of a soundtrack for example, which doesn't say much for it. I think I'll attack things in a more or less chronological order, and trust you'll forgive me any errors in my recounting, chalking them up to my mind's natural attempts to protect me from any longterm effects of viewing ""the movie"".<br/><br/>So we start off with a black and white introduction, no doubt an homage to the Universal Horror Movies Van Helsing draws much inspiration from. How much easier to use B&W to do this, than say...i dunno actual setting and atmosphere, or talented direction and performances. From the moment of his appearance, Richard Roxburgh is a gangrenous arrow lodged in my heart. His interpretation of Dracula as effete twit does more damage to the count than all of Vlad Tepes's crimes combined. From the way he's filmed, you assume the director thinks he's some kind of great performer, someone that deserves to have the camera on him constantly. This is simply not the case. A retarded orangutan with a sledgehammer in a Faberge egg shop has more subtlety and dignity than Roxburgh will ever be capable of. He doesn't even have an interesting face, a feature many other actors can use as a tool to heighten their performance. All Roxburgh has is Thompson Twin hair and incriminating pictures of Steven Sommers apparently.<br/><br/>We then cut to Paris where our hero Van Helsing is trying to kill Shrek. Or Mr. Hyde, it doesn't really matter. He certainly owes a lot to Indiana Jones and Vampire Hunter D (a Japanese cartoon featuring vampires, werewolves, and wide brimmed hat wearing, long haired mystery man which is incidentally also a much better movie for people who want this kind of monster mash entertainment done well) a source i'm sure the costume designers, etc. were well familiar with. I'll take an aside her to mention that I don't really fault Hugh Jackman with anything in this movie, and i'm sure the wheelbarrow of cash they dumped in his lap was hard to turn his nose up to. I only hope Hugh takes more care with roles in his future.<br/><br/>VH is sent to Transylvania to aid the Valerius family who have been ineffectually fighting monsters for generations. This raises the question...how long can a family ineffectually fight monsters before they're just a large grouping of the same last name on a buncha headstones? We're witness to their incompetence when we see that their tactics for hunting werewolves involves only one guy being given a silver bullet, and arming the rest of the hunting party with regular firearms. Also, the Valerius family can't seem to remember which accent they're supposed to be using. None more guilty of this than cinematic albatross, Kate Beckinsale as Anna. She goes from Transylvanian, to British, to British trying to sound American, and at one point Natasha from Bullwinkle, which I found odd. She may be easy on the eyes, but with Van Helsing completing the trifecta of Pearl Harbor and Underworld, If I see her name on the cast list, it's nature's way of warning you that there's gonna be some bad movie ahead.<br/><br/>So Drac's masterplan involves inflicting his bride's shorties on the world. But Movie, you say, don't vampires make other vampires by biting people? Isn't there a whole village of inbred idiots protected by ineffectual monster hunters ripe for the taking? No, we want cgi gremlin knockoffs. Oh, OK, I'll just lie back down and you can continue to kick my groin then, OK?Now, somehow, Frankenstein and the Wolfman tie into making the winged monkey's plan work, but for the life of me, I can't remember how, the hallmark of a really great script. There's so many plot holes pointing them all out may take up more space than IMDb is prepared to provide, so I'll just hit the highlights, some spoilers may follow, but nothing I say is gonna spoil this movie any more than the filmmaker's themselves have. During the carriage chase down winding roads, our fearless heroes fool the flying vampires by having a duplicate carriage on a side road....which should have been plainly visible to any airborne undead. If the wolf man is the only thing that can kill Dracula, why the hell does he keep them around? And it sure would seem that having the antidote handy would be a pretty effective means of negating the threat any potential wolf man assassins might present, but he keeps the tiny vial in a giant room of his goofy wire shrouded tower. Finally, Anna can have the crap kicked out of her by various monsters throughout the movie, even getting dropped five stories by a flying vampire onto a stone floor with a minimum of discomfort, but all it takes is VH to shove her onto a velvet couch while he's wolfed out to kill her.<br/><br/>Van Helsing continues the tradition of incredibly stupid movies with a CGI comb-over that completely fails to distract from the glaring flaws inherent within, the tradition started with such movies as Dragonheart, the Lost World, Armageddon, etc. In addition, it's the second part of a career suicide note that Steven Sommer's started with the Mummy Returns, a vile movie that was without equal until Van Helsing came along. And there, is the only category where it excels."

","If u're no fan of action and wants vampire movies to be slow and non violent this is is not a movie for u. But for me I think this is one of the best vampire movies ever even though all seem to be different from each other. Hugh Jackman is the famous van Helsing and does a favorable impression as a late 19th century action hero taking care of all foul beings.. Kate Beckinsale who I must say is stunning is pretty good too. The rest of the actors are neither doing the best acting or the worst acting ever but fill their roles nicely. <br/><br/>All the elements of Romanian lore is put together in this movie and does it really well, with Dracula, Frankenstein and werewolves all in the mix. The effects are well done and a big step from earlier Dracula movies. The overall plot might seem a bit predictable but hey, this is the great van Helsing vs Dracula. The different settings and locations are all well chosen from castles to villages. <br/><br/>This is a non stop action with a touch of suspense and i'd like more of this type of movies. What it might lack is some depth and some really memorable acting as nothing really stands out in that regard. But it is a very entertaining movie and puts vampires back in their traditional sense, mystical, very evil and Dracula is where he should be, in his castle in Transylvania..."

","I cannot urge viewers strongly enough to avoid this movie. I just wanted summer fun and classic Universal monsters, and I didn't even get that. This is a terrible movie at every level a movie can be bad. The plot is inexplicable. Dracula needs Frankenstein's body to reproduce his hybrid miniature vampire spawn which makes you wonder how vampires survived until Frankenstein was made. Jackman goes through every scene with his eyebrow cocked like this is a James Bond audition, managing to fight a variety of creatures without mussing his carefully maintained haircut. Richard Roxborough conjures up the spirit of Count Chocula in the worst Dracula performance I've ever seen, and I include the Andy Warhols, and the Spanish versions in the 70's. Frankenstein's monster spends the whole movie as the damsel in distress. The Wolf man has no characterization whatsoever. The CGI is so bad, they would have been off simply using animation. This movie is so bad, one begins to wonder if this film's financing should have simply been used to feed the hungry in some developing country instead of this forgettable waste of celluloid. Loathsome."

","The first scene is a campy black-and-white scene involving Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein. I was so confused by this scene; at first I thought it was going to be some kind of movie-within-movie or frame story or something. At the very least, I expected a reveal that would bring reason to the campy acting and unlikely character relationships. It HAD to be intentional. Didn't it?<br/><br/>Apparently not. The next thing I saw was a dead-serious title card reading ""ONE YEAR LATER."" From that moment, I knew it was going to be a long couple of hours.<br/><br/>Sure enough, this movie is packed shoulder to shoulder, start to finish with actors who, for whatever reason, aren't acting. You've got Hugh Jackman over here, making wry comments and being oh, so clever. You've got this horrendously unmenacing Dracula and his community theater reject wives (who spend more than fifty percent of their on screen time as computer-generated harpies without nipples). You've got dudes transforming from naked werewolves into humans with pants.<br/><br/>The design Van Helsing's character is not bad, but it's a little too close to Vampire Hunter D. The film has but two saving graces, and those are Frankenstein's Monster and....hmmm. Sorry, the film has only one saving grace. And in this particular case, he failed to completely save the movie, so for all we know, the movie has NO saving graces. So reading this paragraph has just been a waste of your time.<br/><br/>The idea of a story that binds Dracula, Igor, Frankenstein's Monster and werewolves is appealing, to be sure. That's why there have been so many video games made on that premise. But we shouldn't judge movies and games by the same standards, and anyone who does needs to be kicked in the face. If they were trying to make Castlevania into a movie, they should have just called it Castlevania: The Movie."

I stopped the DVD about an hour and twenty minutes in. I just had no clue what this was about, why I should care, and who all these bad actors were. Really what was Jackman thinking??? This was such a silly idea, I'm sure that Universal is just crying because of all the money they sunk into this garbage and all it's cartoons and crap. None of the movie follows any of the monster's story lines at all. We spend too much time with too many action scenes, still waiting for the movie to actually start.

The ""machine-gun cross-bow"" is a joke, so is Van Helsing's marksmanship - until, of course, he has to hit a bride, then he is suddenly very accurate.<br/><br/>Another scene that was really bad was the brides chasing the carriage over several hours, flying up high in the sky, and yet they seemed to miss the other carriage 100 yards away - please... <br/><br/>I could go on for quite some while but will stop now.

","This is the most ridiculous and preposterous movie I have seen in a long time. The acting is awful, so over the top it is mostly laughable. The plot makes no sense (OK horror films tend not to but this one is under par). It's involuntarily funny up to a point but a deep sense of boredom settled in with me after half an hour or so and never left me until the end, which seemed very long to come. Some people go for special effects, which has never been sufficient for me to like a film, special effects without any other redeeming qualities is just total emptiness. Combining all the monsters that ever existed is pretty silly although it's been done before many times in equally forgettable old horror flicks. By the way, what is Dr. Jekill doing on the top of Notre-Dame de Paris since that's an English story? But why quibble with details in such a mess."

What happened? I did enjoy ""The Mummy"" tremendously, I even liked the ""Mummy Returns"" but this is an outrage and Kate Beckinsale - already proven to be worst actress of the year in ""Underworld"" - seems to have a fable for showing off her body instead of her acting talents, which might prove difficult as these are seemingly nonexistent.<br/><br/>There are indeed many viewers who enjoyed this shallow pop corn flick and it's their good right to do so, but as fan of the genre I could merely wince in my chair seeing how such a potential character as Van Helsing goes to waste in yet another instalment of ""all show and no brains"".<br/><br/>Yet it began really promising with the hunt for Mr. Hyde (very nice CGI there) but sadly these first 15 minutes are the only highlight of this movie and Richard Roxburgh seems to be only actor worth his grain of salt.<br/><br/>Go see The Mummy again instead. 1/10."
"Chris-742","2","3","6","25 June 2004"," Overdoing it.
","This film is some mad cross between james bond, dracula, frankenstein, alien, tarzan and whatever. It's like the worst of Hollywood tackiness. Steal yourself blind taking plot elements from other films, but use them in the worst possible way. And then I have not mentioned the worst. There is simple too much special effects and action in this film, it never ever slows down. You need acting and character in a film. But special effects and action is no substitute for good acting, which we sadly see nothing off in this film. Mostly because the film doesn't pause enough to let there be acting. But also because every time someone says something, not only does that person have the most outrageous accent, but their speaking is so constructed that you wonder what kid wrote the script.<br/><br/>Sometimes the film slows down, and you think, maybe there will be some good acting, maybe some plot, maybe this isn't a completely bad film. But no, the film soon races off, leaving unfinished plot elements and the audience behind. I wasn't the only one sighing in the theater. And there were instances of people giggling at the film, as opposed to giggling with the film. <br/><br/>Now with a lot of work, this film could have been an amusing homage to horror films....or it could have been an amusing turkey. I wish they had cut, say 20 minutes of wire-swinging to do just that and changed the overall tone from...from..ludicrous to comedy. It wouldn't have made the film good, but it would have made it average, and possibly entertaining.<br/><br/>There can only be one grade for this boring mess: a 1 (out of 5 or 10 either one)."

Will Hugh be up for an Oscar any time soon? No..but it was entertaining all the same and it was worth the $4.50 I paid to see it. He delivered quite the performance and Kate Beckinsale did well too. I didn't feel that is was drawn out and boring like some of the reviews had said. I felt it was entertaining the whole way through and I liked that the whole movie wasn't exactly based on slaying and that it had aspects of romance and friendship as well.

","This movie was ok, but very overated. I waited for about 6 months to see this movie and was very dissapointed. From the previews, reviews, and hype I thought this was going to be classic. 1st of all there were too many unecessary special effects. Dracula couldnt ever have a regular conversation without climbing up the wall or causing explosions with his power, this got really annoying quick. Another thing was the story was so predictable, a 5 year old could figure it out. As soom as they found Frankenstein you knew what was going to happen and after this you're just waiting for the movie to end. They had all the right tools to make this a great movie but blew it. All they had to do was spend a little more emphasis on the plot. Then they could have eased back on the special effects. You dont have to have a big special effects scene every 15 seconds. Dracula and his wives didnt have to show their vampire teeth in every conversation they had. The teeth they had werent even planted they were computer generated. These things are repetitive thoughout the movie and this is what hurt it. What a waste, could have been something special."

I don't want to watch a cartoon figure leap about the screen.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the plot jumped all over the place, the sets looked like sets rather than real places and there were several points that inspired unintentional laughter e.g. almost anything with ""the monster"" and Van Helsing howling at the moon.

","1. Abraham Van Helsing, PROFESSOR ABRAHAM Van Helsing was a German man living in Amsterdam and with a Dutch name, who lead the band of heroes in defeating Dracula in the original novel by Bram Stoker. He was a wise, older man, not an action hero, not an angel with amnesia. The fact that he was NOT a youthful action hero was kind of the point. In fact the character most like Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing (the Texan, Quincey Morris) was the one who DIED in the Dracula novel while PROFESSOR Van Helsing survived. It was his cunning and wisdom that defeated Dracula, not a rapid fire cross bow and Dresden Files-esque duster.<br/><br/>2. MAMMALS DO NOT LAY EGGS!!! WHY would female vampires, who used to be human, who take the form of bats (a MAMMAL) lay eggs!?? 3. Why would God erase Gabriel's memory to punish him? How is it a punishment if you don't know you're being punished or why? 4. Why give Dracula the name Vladislaus Dracula (what the Historical Vlad The Impaler signed his name as on documents) yet turn him into a gypsy with a birth age and date of death that don't add up. (Seriously, it claims he's in his twenties when you do the math. Richard Roxburough is NO twenty year old), just so that he can incestuously go after a gypsy descendant? 5. Why did Van Helsing show pity toward the Frankenstein creature but not The Wolfman or Jekyll. The reasoning is the creature didn't choose to be what he is but Jekyll never intended to create Hyde and the werewolf never asked to be bitten. It. does. Not. make. Sense.<br/><br/>6. Why would the Vatican want to destroy an intelligent and apparently non-violent being? 7. I'm tired of the new clichÃ© of action films (and anime) using The Vatican as some covert group of spies and assassins going after supernatural threats.<br/><br/>8. WHY would a werewolf bite kill Dracula? If you read the novel he LIKED wolves, he called them the children of the night and went out of his way to calm and pet the trapped wolves at the London zoo. He can take wolf form himself! He was in the form of a wolf or ""large dog"" when he got off the Demeter in Whitby. Has no one actually read the novel!??"

","Van Helsing. So Hugh Jackman tries to expand. With Van Helsing, don't push your luck Wolverine.<br/><br/>Review: Van Helsing, despite the cool name is far from it. We have a hunter, Helsing, who kills vampires and other creatures of the night. Reasons why are unknown to us. The first thing you will notice is the look of Helsing. Jackman looks cool at least. We also get Kate Beckinsale, so why does this suck? Allow me to tell you. First, The dialog. This movie must have some of the dumbest dialog ever. It will leave you wondering ""What?"" Another is the bad directing. When Helsing is given his mission, they show a picture of two people, one being Beckinsale and after given his mission, the camera looks ONLY at Beckinsale's side of the photo, not the other individual that is just as important. Perhaps Helsing was thinking ""She's hot."" ""If I succeed, perhaps I'll get some."" That's the impression that I got. Another is too much action. Many would not complain about that. So Crass, you would ask, ""Why does that suck?"" Reason: Some of the action is sloppy and with too much action is another way to dodge CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Yes, the ultimate weakness is a tremendous lack of character development. We learn absolutely nothing about anyone. That's why Helsing's reasons to hunt down creatures of the night is unknown to us. He just does. How uninteresting. Also the one who played Faramir in the Lord of the Rings movies is here, However he is a totally annoying monk that sports a hairstyle that would be unappealing to a five year old. His dialog is the worst. Also the acting is quite wooden, with the exception of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. His performance is quite good. He seemed to be the only one here to try and save this movie, but it's a lost cause. What started out as a attempt at a new franchise is going to crash before takeoff.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Disaster. Van Helsing is a poorly executed, inane mess that fails on so many levels. I cannot believe that I managed to stomach any of this mess. The ONLY reason that this gets a two is that I gave Helsing an extra point out of pity. Jackman, stick with Wolverine OK?"

Or worse yet, he'll get one of his undead midget zombies to... uh, I don't know, uppercut your knee cap and bite your ankle? <br/><br/>Frankenstein's monster was not only loaded with hackneyed dialog but was a great addition to the absurdity. And his retarded gait is one of the funniest ways of walking since David Cross's impersonation of a strut in ""Pootie Tang."" Not to mention the funniest scene in the whole movie where we get to see Frankenstein's monster swing from a wire three times in a row in what looks like the same scene looped over and over and over. It made beer shoot out of my nose I was laughing so hard.<br/><br/>The Wolfman was simply ridiculous. Werewolves are big, sure but when are they supposed to be twenty feet tall? Bigger than Frankenstein's monster? And am I supposed to believe this Saturday morning cartoon quality computer generated thing is actually interacting with the characters on screen? Please tell me this was supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>The sexy heroin was also a laugh riot. The thought that anyone could fight anything supernatural or not while wearing a corset with stiletto boots is worth a few chuckles. Sexy? Sure, but so impractical. It's like fighting off zombie Nazis with Bettie Page and Dita von Teese or ghost hunting with the Playboy bunnies.<br/><br/>And Van Helsing? Apparently the creators of this movie never bothered to read ""Dracula"" or even see all the ""Dracula"" movies. This is a cookie cut facsimile of exactly what American cinema does to characters from classic literature: Take a good character and make him a macho cowboy. This version of Van Helsing doesn't even know what a freakin' vampire is.<br/><br/>And he works for the Vatican which apparently manufactures spy gear for supernatural slaying like the Q- branch in James Bond films. (Obviously, the director like James Bond movies so much he copied the Q- gadget scene with little to no scruples. Is the Pope M, then?)<br/><br/>About the special CGI effects? The computer animation from ""The New Adventures of Johnny Quest"" was not only more convincing than ""Van Helsing's"" but was also a more noble effort. The battle between werewolf Helsing and Bat- form Dracula looks like two guys playing ""Soul Caliber"" except the graphics in the movie aren't as good as an Xbox or Playstation 2. <br/><br/>As a horror/ action movie: this simply sucks. Oh, my god, I can't convey in words how much this sucks. Watching someone else play ""Castlevania"" is tenfold better than suffering through this tripe.<br/><br/>But as a comedy? Absolutely hilarious. Grab some beers and some friends and get ready to let the absurdity and hackneyed Hollywood crap that is ""Van Helsing"" rip your sides open."

"chrisr_70","1","3","7","22 October 2005"," Awful
","This was so bad, I had to walk out on this film 15 minutes into it. Absolutely appalling. I loved the old 1930's/40's horror flicks but this is just not them. If you watched Van Helsing and The Mummy back to back you'll see how unsuccessful Van Helsing was at re-capturing that familiar sense of engagement we had with the old classics. For those people saying ""Oh, it's just a bit of fun, camp fun"", I do not think that was Sommers intention and if it was fair play to him. But I will argue that those classics were not just 'camp', they were a lot more textful than that. They had weird, eccentric characters in them but the films were crafted to have your sub-consciousness take the story seriously, that's what made them great. You know what to expect from them, watching them is the closet feeling to that one you get when you sit round a camp fire out in the dark with friends and freak each other out with little spooky tales. Van Helsing fails at this. I am a fan of CGI, but only if it looks real. The CGI in this made me cringe, its part of the reason I walked out the cinema. CGI can look incredibly good, or it can look incredibly bad in movies. You look at the CGI in Van Helsing and cannot help but be disengaged with the film and think, that's not a vampire, its a silly looking computer animation. And there was lots of it too, even in just 15 minutes. This wasn't fun, it was poor. Whenever puppets, costumes or make-up was used in the old horror films, obviously it looks silly but it can be real enough to accept it as being real, for the sake of enjoying the film. As much as I tried, this did not and would happen in Van Helsing with the CGI monsters. I find with most CGI characters in films they just don't have the correct body movement physics or facial expressions to justify themselves as believable characters, its a very serious issue that is overlooked. For me, the CGI in Lord of the Rings was superb, I didn't feel myself being disgusted with it such as in Van Helsing or in the Starwars prequels. Please, save your money and do not buy or rent Van Helsing its just a poor movie which fails as a tribute to the old classics."

I blamed myself for every penny I spent for renting this movie. Then I realised that somebody else paid for the rental and I felt a little better.

There is no climax, the pace of the movie never changes, it just stays at the same level. <br/><br/>Consider this: when watching the movie at home, I was so bored I stopped the film occasionally,I checked my mail, had a look at a couple of websites and so on. Only sheer willpower prevented me from giving up watching the film - well, I was really hoping that this mess would soon end.<br/><br/>So, basically Van Helsing a long and overblown video clip - full of CGI, no real story, no real climax.

Vampires + Werewolves + Frankenstein + Dr Jekyll + James bond like stuff = One of the worst scenarios ever. Acting : Average at best. The characters : They're all so archetypal that I almost feel sorry for the guys who made that movie. The amnesiac anti hero, the adventurous hot chick, the evil vampire, the good doctor blinded by his ambition, ... They're all here. Dialogues : One cheesy line after another.

","In the 18th century, Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is working for the church (???) travels to Romania with a monk Carl (David Wenham) to battle Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), his three brides, the Wolf Man (Will Kemp) and the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley). He's helped by feisty Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale).<br/><br/>This has been trashed by critics everywhere. No it isn't good at all...but I've seen worse. It starts off great with a black & white prologue dealing with Dr. Frankenstein creating the Monster for Dracula. The doctor is killed and so is his creation (supposedly). Then it cuts to a year later with Van Helsing being sent to battle Dracula and his three wives who are attacking a nearby village for blood. There he finds a werewolf roaming about also and the Monster is alive. But Dracula wants the monster to....FORGET IT! The plot just gets more vague and sillier as it goes on. Anyways plot is not the reason this movie exists--it's done to push CGI down our throats.<br/><br/>There's LOTS of action in this film, incredible special effects (all are CGI) and tons of explosions and such---but I was bored. The plot is WAY too vague and the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book. There's no characterizations or depth to ANY of the characters--how was I supposed to care for these people when I didn't know who they were? Also this film has way too much going on it in--the opening has Van Helsing killing Mr. Hyde (and Dr. Jekyll too)! And pitting him against THREE monsters was just overkill. <br/><br/>Jackman was very good (considering he had nothing to do). Beckinsale was terrible but it's not her fault. Wenham unfortunately plays the ""comic"" relief (and is hating every second of it). Kemp has little screen time but he is good (and VERY handsome). Hensley is good as Frankenstein's monster. The makeup on the vampires and werewolves was VERY impressive too. And there was a great fight between two monsters at the end. But it's all money and CGI and no plot or characters. It's also frustrating that the violence was really toned down for the PG-13--there's next to no blood or gore in this film. And it's TOO LONG--an elaborate masquerade party could have been left out completely (and is a total ripoff of Roman Polanski's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers""). This was a bomb at the box office so we're (thankfully) not going to get any sequels. <br/><br/>I can't recommend it--but kids will like it."
"Coventry","1","4","11","16 May 2004"," This must be a joke... A very irritating, BAD joke!
","Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and all the other classic horror actors are turning in their graves right nowThe powerful, atmospheric tales they once made immortal are totally being messed up by a bunch of boisterous computer-effects freaks here! Biggest t**t of them all is 'director' Stephen Sommers, who seems to make a career out of destroying horror milestones. But at least his ugly 'The Mummy'-version had a bit of a story and followed some sort of structure. This film has absolutely NOTHING in it! Nothing, nada!! With horror, this hasn't got anything to doThe film is a whole playground for (awful) special effects and the latest computer gimmicks. In an incredibly clumsy way, the story lines of Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and even Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde are being mixed here. Key-figure in it all is Van Helsing, played by Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman. In the legendary original, Prof. Van Helsing was named Abraham and he had amazing literature knowledge. Now, he's called Gabriel, he works for the Vatican and I don't think he ever read a book. He has a James Bond collection of gadgets and  on top of it all  an irritating and unfunny monk following him around everywhere. Dracula is played by a meaningless fool, Frankenstein's monster all of a sudden seems to have an IQ of 150 and the Wolf Man couldn't look more fake. Sommers is constantly making up new horror-`rules' and he seems to think he can get away with everything. Kate Beckinsdale also walks around in this film. I'll be the very first to admit she's one good looking lady, but she can by no means act! Her character Anna constantly smashes with her head against walls, but she doesn't lose one drop of blood. I'm not going to waste further words to this film: It's terrible! Downright awful and the biggest insult to anyone who ever respected the horror genre. Before it's release already, we knew this wouldn't be a very intellectual approach of the genre, but Van Helsing even goes beneath your lowest expectations. It's irritating from start to finish and you'll more than once feel the need to get up and walk out on it. Death to Stephen Sommers and his entire computer entourage!"

"Tweekums","7","2","4","2 August 2015"," Van Helsing fights Dracula with a little help from Frankenstein's monster!
","As this film opens Dr. Frankenstein has just finished his famous creation when a hoard of torch carrying villagers attack his castle. His patron, one Count Dracula, isn't too concerned; he just wants the creature for his own nefarious purposes and has no further need of the doctor. On the other side of Europe monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing has been summoned to the Vatican; here he is told to head to Transylvania and help the last remaining members of the Valerious in their generations old battle against Dracula. Upon arrival he quickly finds himself helping protect a village from an attack by Dracula's three brides. After this battle he teams up with Anna Valerious (and later Frankenstein's monster) for a battle that will see them fighting werewolves, vampires assorted monsters before a final confrontation with Dracula himself!<br/><br/>If you are looking for a scary horror movie you are likely to be rather disappointed; I can't see this really scaring anybody has reached their teens. However if you are looking for an action packed adventure that tries to pack in elements from every classic Gothic horror as well as quite a few laughs then you should enjoy this. The action barely lets up from start to finish as our heroes battle the forces of evil. Hugh Jackman is great in the title role as he uses an array of weapons such as an automatic crossbow to fight the Brides of Dracula. These brides are suitably seductive without being overly so. Other notable performances come from Kate Beckinsale as Anna and Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. With all the action it may seem surprising that there is time for humour but there are quite a few laughs; many provided by Friar Carl; the Vatican's answer to James Bond's Q, and Igor, Dr Frankenstein's former assistant. The CGI effects are good especially during the many scenes where various creatures transform from their human appearance to a more monstrous one. There is little here to offend and the violence is fairly fantastical so this film can be enjoyed by people of most ages the BBFC '12' certificate is probably about right as children younger than that might find it too scary. Overall a fairly fun film that passes a couple of hours without requiring too much thought."

Nor have we seen a human transform to a werewolf with tearing flesh. And the final fight where Van Helsing as a werewolf transforms from one another and Dracula constantly transforming is just well done. Oh, and did I mention that this is NOT done in dark environments like any other such movies? We actually SEE in full light the transformation process of human to beast! It loosed it's points for the music and the outside churchy story but the rest was just fun to watch and, and I bought the blu-ray disc so that closes it pretty much!"
"bowmanblue","7","2","4","2 September 2014"," Good, but somehow not as great as it should be
","'Van Helsing' has always been a bit of an enigma to me. I own it and have watched it every so often and I can never quite put my finger on what exactly is wrong with it. Obviously, I quite like it, but it always leaves me with the feeling that it should have - somehow - been so much better.<br/><br/>The film was practically made for me - I love Hugh Jackman and he makes a great 'monster hunter.' Kate Beckinsale is naturally sexy as his kick-a$$ love interest. David Wenham adds some comic relief as Van Helsing and Richard Roxborough is brilliantly campy as Count Dracula. Then there are more monsters crammed into this film than Jabba the Hutt's palace. What more could I want? Um, I don't exactly know, but I'm not alone in my confusion. Van Helsing was supposed to be the start of some sort of action/horror franchise. It was certainly given the budget and star-power to launch such a venture. However, it was - almost - a financial flop. It was sort of successful, but not enough to get a proper sequel (there is a lower budget animated one, but that wasn't the original intention).<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the overuse of CGI? Sometimes everything on screen starts to blur into one mass of animation. Perhaps it's that the characters are a little too indestructible to be believable. Seriously... these (supposedly totally human) characters get dropped from great heights again and again and just get up like nothing has happened - a minor gripe, but it always bugged me.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of 'old school' horror, i.e. you know about the Dracula/Frankenstein myths then you might like this, because it certainly pays homage to the classics. It has a lot of charm (kudos to Frankenstein's monster and Drac himself), but somehow falls slightly short of being the modern day classic it was meant to be.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

It is an overwhelming pace and nothing is on screen long enough to make itself welcome.<br/><br/>The new Hollywood with its CG is a bittersweet affair. These Movie Makers are like Kids with a new toy. They play and play and just don't know when to stop. They are all guilty and are suffering an overdose of self-expression. They need an intervention and that could save a lot of Movies.<br/><br/>There is so much energy and excitement here that the Audience is amped out after only a view scenes. There is no catching up. It leaves the good parts to move on so quickly to the next that in the end it is really, too much of a good thing. Overdone, underdeveloped, and ultimately a fantastic failure.

I thought that from beginning to end was completely entertaining. Has a lot of action but also good romance and a little bit of history in it. You just won't get tired of watching this film. The film is really good just to spend the afternoon with a story that has action, suspense, drama and romance. This movie is just pure fun. Van Helsing is a James Bond character of dark Transylvania. And his battles against Dracula are a roller coaster ride with non-stop action and vivid, beautiful scenery.

"BA_Harrison","4","2","4","24 June 2009"," Fangs for nothing, Mr. Sommers.
","At one point during Stephen Sommers' comic book horror/adventure Van Helsing, Count Dracula states that he ""has no heart, he is unable to feel joy or sorrow, he is hollow"". I know exactly what he means because that's how I felt whilst watching Sommers' film: completely unmoved by the whole experience.<br/><br/>Sure, there's a ton of in your face special effects and spectacular set-pieces galore, but none of it connects. It's not scary, it's not funny (despite trying), and it's not exciting; it's just there on the screen, flashy, slick, and irritatingly loud, for over two very long hours. For today's gaming generation, I guess this might be enough, but I found the whole affair lacking.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's titular character is a Vatican-approved vampire slayer who is given the task of hunting down and destroying Dracula before he is able to bring to life his multitude of spawn (the result of having 400 years to kill with three very hot brides). Along with trusty sidekick Carl (who is responsible for an array of technologically advanced weaponry) and beautiful Transylvanian princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale in a tightly laced corset—yum!), Van Helsing faces a series of monstrous creatures and perilous pitfalls as he battles to save the world from the evil count and his offspring.<br/><br/>After a fairly promising opening scene—a classy monochromatic homage to the Universal monster movies of the 30s and 40s—Sommers says 'to hell with logic and pacing', slams his movie into top gear, and unleashes a barrage of outrageous action scenes and lavish computer effects that lend the film a sense of realism that is comparable to your average Looney Tunes cartoon.<br/><br/>The result is audacious to say the least, but the director pushes his luck too far, overstepping the mark on many an occasion: against convention, his Dracula is only vulnerable to werewolves (?!?!); his plot reveals a cure for lycanthropy, a contrivance that proves very convenient for our hero; Van Helsing and Anna possess unnatural agility and superhuman resilience, performing Olympic standard gymnastic moves with ease and surviving numerous high falls without suffering so much as a scratch; Van Helsing leaps over a chasm in a horse drawn carriage; and Frankenstein's monster swings through a window on a power cable to rescue Anna from a vampire.<br/><br/>To be fair, Sommers' mish-mash of monsters and mythical mayhem isn't completely devoid of worth—the sultry brides of Dracula are great, the set design is fantastic, and Greg Cannom's make-up is impressive, particularly for Frankenstein's monster—but the film's 'positives' are overwhelmed by the effects and the sheer unrelenting silliness of the action which stretches plausibility to breaking point."
"zardoz-13","10","2","4","6 February 2008"," Outrageously preposterous but thoroughly entertaining!
","Writer & director Stephen Sommers reinvents the nemesis of ""Dracula"" in ""Van Helsing"" starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Sommers brings the same larger-than-life swashbuckling bravado to ""Van Helsing"" that he brought to his macabre but campy reboot of ""The Mummy"" (1932) in the blockbuster Brendan Fraser flicks ""The Mummy"" (1999) and ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001). Even more outrageously preposterous but thoroughly entertaining than Sommers' adrenalin-driven ""Mummy"" remakes, ""Van Helsing"" alters more than Dracula's archenemy. Sommers performs makeovers on the Frankenstein monster and Dracula's brides, too. Now, the Frankenstein monster fights for the good guys, while the airborne vampire brides swoop down like harpies on their victims and haul them away in their talons. Even Dracula himself undergoes changes. Stakes through the heart, garlic, crucifixes, holy water and sunlight have no effect. However, nothing is as radical as the transformation of Van Helsing. In the original 1931 ""Dracula,"" Professor Abraham Van Helsing was a much older man with close-cropped hair and thick glasses who practiced medicine. In other words, 60-year old vampire slayer Edward Van Sloan looked nothing like buffed up ""X-Men"" star Hugh Jackman. Neither does Jackman resemble the venerable Peter Cushing, who portrayed Van Helsing as an older but more energetic professor type during the 1950s-60s in five Hammer ""Dracula"" movies. An unkempt Anthony Hopkins hammed up the role in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992). The closest anybody has come to Hugh Jackson's Gabriel Van Helsing is Christopher Plummer in ""Dracula 2000."" Nonetheless, even Plummer played Van Helsing as an older man armed with a deadly cross-bow. Not only does Jackman arm himself with a gas-operated, semi-automatic cross-bow, but also he totes two six-guns and a hand-held, kung-fu flying guillotine. For martial arts illiterates, a hand-held, kung-fu flying guillotine looks like a Frisbee with jagged metal edges. Young, virile, and fast on the draw, Jackman's Van Helsing dresses like an Italian western gunslinger with a black, floor-length coat and a broad-brimmed hat. His uncanny resemblance to Clint Eastwood enhances that impression.<br/><br/>""Van Helsing"" hits you with back-to-back prologues that identify the chief characters. An enraged Transylvanian mob storms Dracula's castle in the late 1880s. Evidently, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") has given Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West of ""Notting Hill"") refuge in his castle, so the scientist can complete his experiments with reanimating dead tissue. Of course, Dracula isn't generous for nothing. He has a stake in giving life to the dead offspring of him and his brides. Thousands of icky-looking embryos that dangle lifelessly from the ceiling like wasp nests clutter up Dracula's castle. Meanwhile, the Vatican dispatches Van Helsing as their troubleshooter to destroy monsters. In his opening prologue, Van Helsing appears in Paris with the Eiffel Tower under construction and battles the only non-Universal Studios monster, the Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane's voice), half of Dr. Jekyll. Afterward, our stalwart hero rides back on horse to the Vatican for new orders. Director John Carpenter first linked the Vatican with destroying vampires in his own movie ""Vampires"" (1998) with James Woods as a cross-bow wielding vampire killer. Although he wears old west duds, Van Helsing acts more like James Bond. At the Vatican, the equivalent of 007's Q in the guise of Friar Carl (scene-stealing David Wenham, Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) devises a variety of gadgets for Van Helsing. Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong of ""Patriot Games"") dispatches Van Helsing to save the last two members of a vampire slaying clan. They are gypsy princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale of ""Pearl Harbor"") and her brother Veklan (Will Kemp of ""Mindhunters"")who gets bitten by a werewolf early on in the action. Unfortunately, Veklan falls under Dracula's power and becomes his werewolf slave. Initially, neither Van Helsing nor Anna likes each other, but they join forces reluctantly to put Dracula on ice. In the middle of all this mayhem, we find the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley of ""Someone Like You"") serving as the key to Dracula's efforts to give his dead offspring life.<br/><br/>Sommers pulls out all stops in this slam-bang, high-octane, over-the-top, roller-coaster of an adventure that has vampires and werewolves battling each other. Twists follow turns in the contrived but imaginative plot, and surprises alternate with shocks. Although he has revamped those classic horror characters, Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" consists more of atmospheric, computer-generated locales and harrowing jolts that occur when monsters appear suddenly behind characters for maximum shock effect. No, anybody over age 12 shouldn't suffer nightmares from this formulaic action epic, because ""Van Helsing"" is basically a horror comedy. Imagine a monster mash cross-between of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""The Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are In My Neck"" (1967), and you'll know what to expect of ""Van Helsing."" Nothing about ""Van Helsing"" is remotely credible, but the breathlessly paced story throws so many curves that you cannot predict what is going to happen from one set-piece to the next. When Hugh Jackman isn't performing testosterone-fueled stunts, Kate Beckinsale indulges in her own estrogen-based acrobatics that make her werewolf slayer in ""Underworld"" seem tame by comparison. Neither character has enough time to romance the other, because they find themselves constantly jumping through metaphorical flaming hoops in an unceasing battle with evil. If ""Van Helsing"" has a flaw, it is casting Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. He looks like Dudley Moore and he lacks menace. You have to wonder why Universal couldn't have attracted a bigger star to off-set the combined star power of Beckinsale and Jackman. Ultimately, while ""Van Helsing"" is never boring, the changes in these legendary horror characters probably won't bother younger audiences as much as older ones weaned on inflexible rules governing the behavior of vampires and werewolves. You'll get your money's worth out of ""Van Helsing."""

Now I must admit Hugh Jackman (in ""Swordfish"") and Kate Beckinsale (in ""Aviator"")can do no wrong in my eyes and you both are such beautiful people. Their acting did not appear as acting. Played Anna and Van Helsing as if they were these characters. Richard Roxbaugh was such a surprise as Dracula. Brought this highly intelligent, selfish, and a bit curious creature to real life.

","Van Helsing, a film I went to see purely because it was raining outside. And I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The basic genre is action/adventure/horror; that pretty much sums the film up. The plot isn't up to much and it looks as though it was just a big get together of all of Universal's favourite monsters. But sit back and enjoy the action and the film is pretty good, the effects work and the music is fitting. Yes, the acting isn't going to win any Oscars and KAte Beckinsale does what she seems to do best- kick butt in a tight costume (Underworld + its sequel). If you look at Stephen Sommers' other films 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy Returns' it becomes evident that fun, sometimes silly and generally poorly plotted action adventures are what he likes to do. Again, films like this won't appeal to everyone and won't win any awards but don't we go to the cinema to relax and enjoy the film and Van Helsing fits the bill (though be careful not to spill your popcorn- there are a few bits to give you a fright). I have seen Hugh Jackman do much better and for people who have only seen him in this film I say that he is really a very talented actor. The actors are mostly well cast and there is plenty for the boys (Beckinsale) and the girls (Jackman) to enjoy. Don't watch the film if you want to see something sophisticated and well-scripted with stellar performances and superb dialogue, please steer clear. However, for a night in, this movie is great- especially for the younger generation who will probably be able to look over the mistakes and plot to the action sequences and CGI. All in all this is an easy going low-budget flick which you will either love or hate, decide for yourself. Some of you may enjoy the comedic references and one-liners and others will think they are silly and out of place but I liked the overall effect of the film and think that too many critics took it too seriously and therefore the film was underrated. Van Helsing is worth renting at least, you may enjoy it as much as I did!"

","This action-packed movie is to cool! brilliantly cast, especially the vampires. the way the wings and weather were made were so perfect. If you say this movie is bad you must be in another world. Van Helsing may be a rip-off of the old detective, but with a young person doing the part they can make him do a back flip. if it where the old one we would be watching an old guy putting his fingers into a cross. The surprise ending with his love dying is the perfect touch of tragedy, because all great hero's lose someone. like spider man has lost 4 girls ( 3 to many ). but anyway this movie is the best. warning: this movie is not for the faint of heart or really touchy people. please don't tell your siblings the surprise ending! my sister did the same thing and i did'nt enjoy it as much as i should have. this will stand for at least the next 10-20 years.<br/><br/>-Fletch"
"TheHande","8","2","4","3 December 2005"," Almost like Castlevania
","Hugh Jackman is definitely the Clint Eastwood of our generation. On screen he has such a presence that the viewer can't be but fascinated and wonder what is he thinking right now. In this severely under-rated Monster-Fantasy-Adventure Jackman performs the role of vampire-hunter/monster-slayer Van Helsing.<br/><br/>The movie appears to have various flares to it. From James Bond to Castlevania which is something I really enjoyed. As far as werewolves go, I thought the CG on most of the creatures was very well done as were the computer-effects in most parts of the movie. The additional comic elements also give the movie extra-life.<br/><br/>Even so certain parts of the film were perhaps a bit goofy, but all in all this is a brilliant adventure. Long live Hugh Jackman!"
"russem31","7","2","4","2 December 2005"," Above average
","Stephen Sommer, of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns fame, directs his next big adventure, Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckingsale in the lead roles. Just like The Mummy, Van Helsing is an above action action flick that works on most levels, even though the film isn't excellent by any means. What's really missing for me are strong performances and a solid score (as Alan Silvestri provided for The Mummy Returns). However, the story concept is interesting, combining horror legends Count Dracula, Frankenstein Monster, and The Wolf Man into one film. That in itself makes this movie a curiosity to see, if only for just one viewing. Above average, 7 out of 10."
"misbegotten","4","2","4","26 October 2005"," Curse you, Steven Sommers!
","I can't say, hand on heart, that Van Helsing is a good movie. However, it's not a total disaster either. It's one of those films that exists in the grey area in-between, alongside the not bad, the okay, the passable.<br/><br/>Van Helsing finds writer and director Steven Sommers locked into the one-damn-thing-after-another type narrative that he displayed in the dreadful The Mummy Returns, and while Van Helsing never quite stoops to the depths of that movie, you do wish that Sommers would realise that visual spectacle and constant events are insufficient substitutes for a decent story and characterisation.<br/><br/>Sommers's script has several major weaknesses. First, despite all the pre-release hype about this movie featuring Dracula, Frankenstein plus his Monster, and the Wolf Man, in actuality the latter creature does not appear. Universal's Wolf Man was Lawrence Talbot, played by Lon Chaney Junior in five movies during the 40s (the character also turned up in a Lovecraftian graphic novel written a few years ago by Neil Gaiman). There are several werewolves in Van Helsing, but none of them are Talbot. Sorry if it seems I'm being a bit nit-picky about this, but it's like going to see a James Bond movie only to find that the hero isn't 007 but a stand-in called Ken Smith. It's just not the same.<br/><br/>As for those aforementioned werewolves, there isn't any real reason for either them or Frankenstein's Monster to be in the movie. They do actually turn out to be of vital importance to the story, but only because Sommers's script is so contrived. I get the impression he was hellbent on cramming as many monsters as he could into this film, and came up with any reason he could to explain their presence in the story, no matter how half-baked. The result is that Frankenstein's Creature and the werewolves can't even be considered proper characters in this movie - they're just walking plot devices.<br/><br/>In fact, the entire film is full of such plot devices. Time and again, characters display certain abilities, suddenly know important information, or are revealed to be in possession of something vital to the story, and the why, how, or where of any of it is never addressed. We're just supposed to take it as read. Sommers seems to assume that as long as something is pushing the story forward, then it doesn't need explaining.<br/><br/>The movie contains almost non-stop CGI (no surprises there), but this isn't quite as annoying as I thought it would be. The Mr. Hyde that Van Helsing battles at the beginning of the film is surprisingly passable, with gorilla-like swinging movements that emphasise Hyde's primeval nature. In fact there's so much swinging from ropes and cables in this movie that Sommers could use it as a show reel to audition for the job of directing future Spider Man sequels or Tarzan flicks. <br/><br/>As for the cast, Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale struggle to do much with their extremely underwritten characters. Their roles can be summed up in a single sentence each: Van Helsing (Jackman) is brave, fights monsters, and can't remember his past. Anna Valerious (Beckinsale) is brave, fights monsters, and is the last of her gypsy/warrior bloodline. And that's it.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have criticised Robert Roxburgh's performance as Dracula, but personally I thought he was fine. That said, the character was lacking something, but I can't decide if that's due to Roxburgh or the script: both Dracula and his grand scheme never really feel like much of a threat (unlike Roxburgh's Moriarty in the under-rated League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, who seemed quite capable of conquering the world).<br/><br/>I've always thought that the Three Brides were one of the most interesting aspects of the Dracula story, sadly overlooked in the majority of movies featuring the Count. Therefore I'm pleased to report that the Brides get more screen time here than in any other Dracula film I can think of (with the notable exception of Dracula 2000). However, having cast three truly stunning, gorgeous & beautiful actresses as the Brides, Sommers inexplicably succumbs to his CGI addiction and has the characters portrayed by computer generated winged harpies most of the time. It's a crime against nature (Just ask Roxburgh: he's gotten engaged to one of the Brides. Now that's method acting.).<br/><br/>Amongst the rest of the supporting cast, David Wenham shines as Van Helsing's sidekick, and gets the film's best (only?) catchphrase: ""I'm not a monk. I'm a friar."" Meanwhile, Kevin O'Connor - a regular fixture in Sommers movies - plays Dracula's turncoat henchman Igor, but is hampered by unconvincing latex makeup. <br/><br/>Van Helsing contains all the usual flaws that we've come to expect in a Sommers movie - or any modern big budget Hollywood movie, come to that. But it's reasonably entertaining, and these days we tend to take from these kinds of studio movies any crumbs that we can. It's just a shame that we have to satisfy ourselves with such meagre offerings."

","I think that this is an all-around great movie for several reasons. 1. Considering that there wasn't a huge amount of money spent on the movie, they did really well with what they had. 2. The acting is great. I like Hugh Jackman as an actor and I think that he molded right into the part of Van Helsing. Kate Beckinsale always impresses me with her acting and I hope to see her in more movies in the future. I see that she has just completed another one and is working on another now. Wonderful! Keep it up, Kate! 3. The actors appeared to be having a great time making the movie. and the kind of wry humor that showed up throughout the movie - whether intentional or not - made it a fun movie to watch. The humor also made it easier to connect with the characters and use my imagination more to sympathize with the heroes of the movie. 5. The special effects and stunts were great! I imagined what the filming must have been like. <br/><br/>I am greatly impressed with the actors' ability to perform around the combination of technologies that were used to accomplish the movie. There were many elements that, in imagining myself in their shoes, would have distracted me. Seeing this kind of work by actors helps me to appreciate what they do even more. 6. I thought the extras on the DVD were good and the commentaries by the director/producer and actors were good too. The commentaries add a lot to the movie and make it an even richer experience."

As for the acting,Kate Beckinsale has done much better films;Jakcman isn't that bad,but his character lacks something of what made Wolverine so loved by everyone;Roxburg's Dracula is amusing,although it seems he's parodying Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee.The only actors really worth watching between the endless CG battles are Hensley,Wenham and Kevin J.

","Van Helsing is one of the best executed 'Special Effects type of Movie' that has ever been made. Don't listen to the negative reviews for people who wanted more of a drama storyline. The story is there: Van Helsing hunts down monsters (Mr.Hyde, Werewolves, Vampires,Dracula) and he does it very well. I ask anyone not to be impressed with this movie for it's efficient action and story-telling, to give it a 2nd look because this was one very enjoyable movie. Start with the sequence with Van Helsing hunting down an amazing life like Mr. Hyde and dare not to be impressed. I have not witnessed this kind of special effects in any other movie to date! And...the fine work keeps coming: the transformation of the werewolves, the flying vampires, Frankenstein, and finally Dracula himself, with his amazing castle. Let's face it, this is the kind of movie that brings back memories of when you were a kid.

"Buguise","1","2","4","18 August 2005"," A Monstrosity
","With a plot that is pieced together much like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, this movie almost singlehandedly destroys the romance of the classic horror films which precede it. It's not the actors' fault. They can hardly be faulted for dialog that lacks the charm of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". On the contrary, Jackman, Beckinsale, Roxburgh, Wenham and Hensley give good performances within the limits of the material they are given to work with. The special effects are passable--at times even engaging; the direction and cinematography, tolerable if somewhat derivative.<br/><br/>It is the script itself which is the problem. It fails as horror, a genre which requires at least some minimal degree of psychological involvement. It fails as thriller for, when Van Helsing finally confronts the moment of truth, this viewer simply did not care. It fails in clarity because it is not possible to parse whether our Van Helsing is a force for good or whether he is simply an amoral 007 on a mission from God. In his own words, he is something of a murderer and something of a destroyer of evil. However, the script never allows him to reveal any conflict between the two.<br/><br/>In summary, this is an adventure without conflict, more monstrous than of monsters, more horrible than of horror."

","""Van Helsing"" uses a lot of old Universal Monster film bits in the film and the film will appeal more to those who may appreciate the genre. However, the film is mostly a CGI fest, with a plot that can be considered laughable at best.<br/><br/>Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman)works for the Vatican to rid the world of monsters. Van Helsing is also considered a murderer as well by outsiders. Van Helsing is also a bit of a mystery: He has been alive and around for hundreds of years, and has no clue to who he really is (or was). The Vatican has a mission for him: To go to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh)from conducting experiments in which a vast amount of his ""children"" would be brought to life (He and his 3 brides are dead, so none of their children can live without some help). To do this, he needs Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley)to achieve his task.<br/><br/>Van Helsing, despite his skills, needs some help. He gets this in the form of Carl (David Wenham) a friar who works with the Vatican and provides the weapons, and Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), who comes from a long line of monster hunters who cannot enter heaven unless Dracula is destroyed, and whose brother Velkan (Will Kemp)has become a werewolf.<br/><br/>The film has long stretches which can bore you to tears. I'm not saying it's completely bad, it's just that the film has a lot of wasted potential. You see parts of a good old fashion monster mash on the screen and wish that it could have been better.<br/><br/>If you grew up with the Universal Horror Classics (Especially when they would put the creatures together in films like ""House of Dracula"" or any of the ""Abbott and Costello"" monster films), then this may remind you of days long gone. Otherwise, you may end up getting disappointed by what's on the screen."

"eetstatik","Null","2","4","3 June 2005"," A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie
","Stephen Sommers is a man I had previously had an odd view of. Yes, his movies were all style and rather idiotic at times, but on the other hand you could sense the almost child-like glee in which he approached his movies. The man seemed to do it because he loved doing big action adventures and in an industry where everyone signs on the dotted line just for the money, that is something of a relief. Not after I saw Van Helsing, though. I will be blunt and tell you that this is probably the cheesiest, dumbest, and surprisingly boring movies I have seen in a long time. Sommers is not doing it because he loves it like he did with the moronic but strangely charming The Mummy series, but most likely because he got a pretty big paycheck. How else can we explain just how hollow the characters are. I know this is not drama, I expect that, but Brendan Frasier in The Mummy was an interesting guy even if not the most developed. Van Helsing himself seems like the perfect setup for a great comic-book hero but all his details are terribly muddled or completely disposed of. And the story--dear god--a simple adventure that will fulfill the potential of the setup would suffice, but it honestly feels like it was made up on the spot. The direction itself is flat, like Sommers just wanted to get it over with. He's not a great director, but he can at least stay asleep behind the camera. <br/><br/>The cast, however, suffers the greatest as some of them seem genuinely embarrassed. Kate Beckinsale needs to stop doing these movies because she's not that great at them as her accent is laughable (she got it from Boris and Natasha) and she looks truly humiliated to be in this drek. Poor girl. Richard Roxbury as Dracula tries his best and seems to be having fun but he's the only one as his campy performance is grating. But Hugh Jackman. Poor Hugh, he's a decent actor, a handsome leading man and seems like an alright guy, but he needs to fire his agent. He's been in crap movie after crap movie and even though he tries his damndest to be a professional he can't save this. Sad that such an alright guy can't pick a decent script because he (and to be fair the whole cast) deserves better. <br/><br/>As for the action, well, maybe i'm spoiled but it seemed boring and lifeless. The main attraction of the movie and they can't even make it interesting? Bad, bad, bad. As far as the CGI goes it is grotesquely over used and rather shoddy. I don't mind CGI but it has to be used (like all effects) to serve the vision but it is the vision itself and surprisingly fake looking considering the good work of ILM and the huge budget of the movie. I will ask the question on my mind the whole time. How do you screw up Wolverine tearing through a myriad of zombies, werewolves, vampires, and Frankenstein's monster with steam-punk weapons? Simple. Have a greedy second-grader write and direct it."
"smitty1994","8","2","4","8 May 2005"," This was a COMEDY Thriller!
","And worth watching if for nothing else but the tongue in cheek repartee between the characters. The costumes were outlandish and the weapons unbelievable but this is to be expected in an updated comic book-like storytelling of the legend of Dracula. <br/><br/>Only someone with a seriously fractured funny bone could possibly fail to grasp that the action of exaggerated falls, flips and aerial acrobatics was anything but comedy! Come on guys, get a grip! This is a movie designed to be campy and entertaining, like the Batman or Starwars movies of past decades.<br/><br/>Simply put, I liked it! And I also found it amusing to see so many character actors from other recently popular movies having a good time in this one. Look for the recognizable and not so recognizable actors from: Lord of the Rings, The Mummy, The X-Men and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. And watch for the lighthearted takeoff on the James Bond and Major Boothrow relationship. Try to guess who was who in what movie while you watch, and compare the actors performance in this movie to their other offerings. And note how Richard Roxburgh almost completely steals the show as the mesmerizing Old Count. <br/><br/>To summarize, the movie is a delight for the young at heart, the fans of make believe and devourers of comic books. Folks, see it for yourself and judge! Have some fun! Get a bowl of hot buttered popcorn and a big cold drink and lean back for a rollicking good time and a goodly number of belly laughs at the antics of our heroes, Van Helsing, Anna and Carl vs. the villains, Count Dracula, Igor and The Brides."

(However, if you are put off by guts and gore, then this is not your movie.)<br/><br/>I wasn't looking for excellent acting in this movie, and so was not disappointed with the some-what canned performance of some of the secondary actors. I found Van Helsing's sidekick quite funny, and would have loved to see more of him in the film. Some viewers have been put off by Van Helsing's invincibility, but there is a softer side--emotionally-- to the monster- slayer that I enjoyed seeing in the movie. <br/><br/>The special effects may not have been very original, but I thought that they were well done and added to the overall experience of the movie."

"rparham","7","2","4","23 April 2005"," A textbook guilty pleasure
","Many of us have, as children, engaged in the fascination of pitting various different fictional beloved characters against each other in a variety of scenarios. ""What if Superman fought Spider-Man?"" Van Helsing is the big-budget silver screen treatment of one of those scenarios, involving three of the biggest horror icons in film history, Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. These three legends have been tossed into the blender, along with a mix of special effects, elaborate production design and action, then writer-director Stephen Sommers hit puree resulting in something, which, while not a masterpiece, does have the capability to entertain.<br/><br/>Although billed as a modern updating of the Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s, Van Helsing has very little in common with those films. They were low-budget mood pieces, cultivated by a studio which, as a ""major minor"" (i.e. a studio with no theater chain), couldn't afford to make the big event films that competitors such as MGM was churning out in those days. The horror film was also custom built for Universal's talent base, many of whom had a German film background and were steeped in German expressionism, featuring harsh shadows and dark subject matter. Van Helsing, on the other hand, while maintaining some of the look of those old films, is a hyped-up action film, lacking much in the way of any scares, no suspense to speak of, and enough money obviously being spent to fund a small country.<br/><br/>The film opens with a sequence filmed in black and white, proving Sommers does have an understanding of where the roots of his film come from. The prologue features Dr. Frankenstein bringing his creature to life, under the watchful eye of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburg). When Dr. Frankenstein isn't happy with the plans Dracula has for his creation, Dracula kills him and the monster flees, only to be trapped in a nearby windmill which is burned to the ground by an angry mob of villagers. The film then introduces us to our hero, hunting down one Mr. Hyde in the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral, a double homage to both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. After dispatching Hyde, Van Helsing, working for a secret organization representing all religions of the world, is ordered to Transylvania to assist the dying Valerious clan, who has sworn a pact to never enter heaven until Dracula is destroyed, and of whom only two are left, sister and brother Anna (Kate Beckinsale) and Velkan. In Transylvania, Van Helsing, accompanied by a medieval version of Q, Friar Carl (David Wenham), discovers that Dracula is planning to use the research of Dr. Frankenstein to bring his undead children to life, not to mention that Velkan has been transformed into a werewolf by Dracula, and that Frankenstein's monster has survived and is being hunted by Dracula.<br/><br/>As with The Mummy and The Mummy Returns before it, Van Helsing is a film that has it's tongue firmly planted in it's cheek. You can never really take anything too seriously at any point in the film, it all has a light air to it. Many have been turned off by this aspect of the film, but I didn't find it distracting. Sure, it's not Shakespeare, but it also isn't total camp either. It's absolutely ridiculous, yes, but Sommer's energy and desire to have a good time is infectious, and the film was just fun to watch.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is wall-to-wall action from start to finish. Thre is little time to take a breath in between one major set-piece and the next, so those looking for a slow-paced film had best look elsewhere. Van Helsing is all chases, fights, shoot-outs and brawls, and yet, unlike films from uber-action director Michael Bay, the action sequences never really get boring. Perhaps it's because they are all unique in one sense or another, with Sommers never really repeating something after using it once. The action sequences are top notch also, well choreographed and exciting. If you are in search of a good action film, Van Helsing would fit the bill on this level.<br/><br/>Van Helsing also features stunning production design. I have always been a fan of Gothic horror film imagery, and this film is bathed in it. From the castles, to the costumes, to the weaponry, it's a feast for the eyes and should be in contention for the art direction award come Oscar season.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Van Helsing is a mixed bag. Hugh Jackman equits himself well enough, managing to stay believable while surrounded by strange sights and sounds. Kate Beckinsale, as Anna, doesn't fare quite as well. Her accent and sometimes overblown reactions to what's happening on screen help make her one of the less impressive performers in the film. Richard Roxburg is a bit over the top at times with his accent and mannerisms, but the material pretty much calls for it. The worst example of actors pushing the limits are Dracula's three brides (Elena Anaya, Sylvia Colloca and Josie Maran) who are constantly writhing, hissing, spitting and just generally making a nuisance of themselves. They could have been toned down considerably.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is a film that would be filed in the area of ""guilty pleasure."" There is stuff here to criticize, but at the same time, I can't help but enjoy myself while watching it, and in the end, isn't that all that matters."
"gftbiloxi","2","2","4","29 March 2005"," I Used The Fast Forward on My Remote A Lot
","In the 1940s Universal Studios attempted to re-energize horror films at the box office by churning out movies that crammed as many famous monsters into the plot line as possible. The result was usually more notable for being silly than effective, and in spite of its highly touted CGI effects VAN HELSING is sillier still.<br/><br/>Suggested by the vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, the film presents a young and sexy Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is in the employ of a secret sect of the Roman Catholic Church run along James Bond lines. After a little run in with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvannia along with a trusty Friar as sidekick. There they promptly meet a sexy vampire hunting gypsy princess, and the three promptly encounter the Wolf Man, the Frankestein Monster, Dracula, Dracula's Brides, and even Dracula's Babies. Who would have thunk it? The CGI effects are impressive and the occasional homages to the original Universal Studio horror films of the 1930s and 1940s are occasionally amusing--but the whole thing very quickly collapses into a lot of visual and audio noise, and there isn't much to hold it together. After about half an hour I began to use the fast forward button on my remote a lot. It's a case of the director, actors, and special effects people having more fun than the audience.<br/><br/>The film is presently available to the homemarket on DVD. The transfer is quite good, although to my eye CGI effects do not work as well on the home screen as they do on the big screen. There are also a handful of bonuses, none of which are greatly interesting or particularly well done. Final take: this a movie that seems to be made by and for a bunch of hyperactive fourteen year old boys without a whole lot of imagination.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"haoumaru","10","2","4","6 February 2005"," One of my fav movies! Awesome! Its just like Castlevania!
","I have always been a big fan of the Akumajou Dracula (Castlevania) series, and since i saw the trailer of this movie I noticed there was something similar to it in Van Helsing. So I was looking forward to see it. And I did and it surpassed my expectations by far.<br/><br/>That was one year ago, I saw it today on DVD and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Van Helsing is an awesome movie, it has a great cast, excellent characters, locations and a wonderful storyline.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was a great choice to play the main character Gabriel Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale did a good job as Anna Valerious. The character design of the monsters is incredible, very well done and their CG rendering is convincing and stunning. Also, the non-CG characters, such as Frankenstein's monster, look stunning too. The Werewolf, is awesome, it's just as I imagine them, incredibly real-life looking and incredibly savage.<br/><br/>The locations are very pleasant to see, and they add a very nice touch of eeriness to the movie. Everything in it, from the start is top notch and though the movie is set in the 19th century, it has an excellent middle ages atmosphere, with strange frightened people everywhere, many religious references,prayers in Latin, catholic paraphernalia and themes, the oppressive clergymen from the Vatican and dark Gothic art. In two words, simply wonderful.<br/><br/>I have noticed some people says they didn't enjoy the movie and didn't like it. Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and mine is that this movie couldn't be better. A truly masterpiece, and I am not a guy that is into horror, gore, vampire, or Goth movies. I liked it very much because it is a great movie in all senses, and it did a wonderful job with each of the classic monsters we know and love: Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Werewolf, etc.<br/><br/>This is just a short review I will make for now, I will soon add more of my thoughts about this incredible motion picture. Flawless, awesome, and fantastic. My favorite movie. This is the closest you can get to see the manga/anime world of Castlevania brought to life.<br/><br/>Simply perfect. 100 out of 100."

","let's start with a mix of the stories of Dracula and Frankenstein. Add some eggs of Alien(s), and later on have many more. Out the eggs come Gremlins. Funny creatures. They behave really like the pixies of the Harry Potter movies, and they behave badly. There seems to be need for quite a bit from Lord of the Rings, like the maps, the horses and the nice views of snowy mountaintops. Dracula wants his ring, but is not yet calling it his precious. Add some feel and wit of Buffy and Angel episodes. Sprinkle some silly special effects and anachronisms of Wild Wild West and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Frankenstein's brain was flown in from the set of the next sequel of Silence of the Lambs. A mirror acts like a Stargate, go through it and be somewhere completely different suddenly. Some castles are moved from New Zealand, and Saruman and Sauran sorely miss them. I've seen Jack Nicholson do a better werewolf. Van can surf like Legolas, but this looks even more unbelievable. Everybody is able to perform rope-slinging like Spidey, even the lady outdoes Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>All humans have super strength and survive blows that would kill a rhino, survive 50 yard drops that would smash the sturdiest marble.<br/><br/>Oooh, and of course we got Faramir from LOTR, behaving silly and cowardly. And Wolverine from X-Men, behaving heroic and gentlemen-like. Rubeus Hagrid from Harry Potter is killed way too soon. M of the League is way too human and friendly to convince as a vampire. Selene of Underworld though is a good and very strong vampire killer, and how tiny is her waist, it's stunning, but it being very unpractical does of course not stop her.<br/><br/>Ah, all ends well that ends like Ghost. No Swayze though... But the end is an invitation for a sequel. I hope it won't be made.<br/><br/>Of course it's dark, snowing and/or raining all the time. The acting is a bit thin, it's all a caricature. The plot, well, it makes hardly any sense. The story goes ways Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley have never thought of and would certainly not approve.<br/><br/>It's all way too silly. I give it a 3. Not a 1.

I am so glad I only wasted a couple of dollars renting it instead of buying the DVD or having seen it in the theater. One critic (that I read ""after"" watching) said ""This isn't a film, it's a cinematic headache..."", I wish I had taken the time to search out reviews before renting. The movie started with Dr Jeckyl, changed into his alter ego Mr. Hyde but inexplicably 3 times as large as a normal human and so obviously digitized it was laughable. The whole movie is supposed to be set in the 1800s yet they've got weapons right out from Bond movies and an underground, high tech lab made to look old in Rome run by the church. It's like they threw in every monster and grim looking Transylvanian they could find into this movie and still failed. As with all poor movies only the trailer scenes were engaging. I am so surprised to find any positive comments on this dreadful movie. Last two words of advice for those thinking to rent or buy: ""Don't bother."""

","Drawing on every clichÃ© known to man, Van Helsing serves as a testament to a plot based less on intelligence than it is on testosterone. This has some of the most facets going against it of any movie I've seen. First of all, it's doomed right away when attempting not one- but several classic horror stories- all pieced together like a quilt made by a mentally challenged armless...well, Hollywood director. It attempts to use the melodramatic air as classic and endearing but instead ends up with Frankentstein's monster yelling the most stereotypical ""Why?!?!"" while holding a dead body, and such witty lines as ""Do you like to fly?"" (or something close) when Van Helsing is lifted in the air by she-vampires. Terrible, terribly done film- but the most disappointing part is that it wasn't acknowledged as being as terrible as it was."

","Van Helsing is what happens when Stephen Sommers, whose successful re-imagining of the Mummy made a lot of money, decides to do an update of some more Universal favorites. This time Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein. Van Helsing is a film of ups and downs. I really loved the black and white beginning. It was a nice homage to James Whale's Frankenstein. I kind of wanted the whole film to look like that. And then I hate the introduction of Van Helsing as he fights The Hulk, oops, I mean Mr. Hyde. What I truly despise about Van Helsing is all the terrible CGI. I remember a time when all make-up effects were practical, and they looked believable. Remember American Werewolf in London, The Howling, and even the original Wolf Man? Something real is far more terrifying than some obvious computer effect. It takes you right out of the movie. Mr Hyde, the Werewolf, and Dracula all looked terrible in my opinion and I long for the day when filmmakers realize that too. But I think Sommers did the best job he could with intertwining all of the story lines without altering too much of the original mythos. That was a real plus. And of course the acting was fine. Hugh Jackman is always really good, Kate Beckinsale is wonderful, Richard Roxburgh may have been a bit over the top but it was that kind of role, and Kevin J. O'Connor does what he does best. O'Connor's Igor was one of the characters I was most impressed with. He was like a wicked combination of Dwight Frye and Skeletor. The whole time I was watching Van Helsing I was thinking I would have really enjoyed this if I were a kid. This is the closest thing to The Monster Squad I've seen for the younger generation. While not a complete waste of time, it would be a better starter kit for young ones interested in horror."

Van Helsing {Gabriel by the way not Abraham} is sent to Transylvania by the church destroy Count Dracula,who's on a ruthless hunt for Frankenstein's monster. Also starring the Wolfman. I for one thought the plot was ludicrous. and another really lame addition to this movie was a scene where Hugh Jackman and Cate Beckinsale are drinking absinthe before they go into battle, Not just a sip either I mean she takes gulp. Those of us who know what absinthe is, knows that drinking that and fighting vampires wouldn't exactly go hand and hand. another complaint I had about this movie was that it was plagued with very obvious CGI. A good example is the Jekyll/Hyde.Mr.Hyde looks like Shrek on steroids. or Cate Beckinsale who can fall twenty stories from a castle window slam into a concrete ledge and get up like nothing happened. <br/><br/>But I'm sure Van Helsing 2 will be a lot of laughs when Van Helsing {Gabriel not Abraham}is sent to Tokyo after taking down King Kong to stop Godzilla, who wakes up Mothra, who is brutal enemies with Megalon!

Like The Avengers movie (which got similarly scathing reviews) my expectations for Van Helsing were absolutely rock bottom. So it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise when I found the film to be fun, entertaining and quite enjoyable overall. People here are complaining about the CGI monsters. What's the beef? This is the 21st century. What do you want? A very well done CGI Mr. Hyde (voiced by Robbie Coltrane, no less) or some guy in a ripped tuxedo baring his teeth a la Spencer Tracy? Fire up those computers and bring on the CGI! Actually I found the CGI effects quite good for the most part. You want bad CGI, then check out James Bond surfing down a glacier in Die Another Day.<br/><br/>So I'll join the minority and say that Van Helsing is well worth watching. Jackman is fine as always and the rest of the cast holds their own. The plot is just fine as well.

","And this is S.Sommers homage to the great old horror films of Universal studio? This is,without any exaggeration,the poorest excuse of a movie I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>When a single movie menages to destroy everything you love and cherish about creature features of old,Dracula,Frankenstein and werewolf it's time to realize that this guy shouldn't be allowed near anything remotely similar, ever again. How can you take three of the most legendary creatures,huge amounts of money,pretty useful actors and turn it into year biggest letdown?<br/><br/>There is so much that's incredibly bad and laughable about this movie that I wont even try writing about all of it cause it would take a couple of days! I have seen every S.Sommers movie and it is only The Mummy that's even close to being a reasonably good movie, next to Deep Rising, which I truly enjoyed. Entertaining B-movie and fully aware of it, thats one of the things that made it work. Here he has much more money and he end up creating a turd. Effects are even worse then in The Mummy Returns (not included Scorpion King off course-still the worst CG effect ever) and that's saying a lot. The movie feels more like Shreck or Finding Nemo than horror adventure or whatever he tried to make. God only knows!<br/><br/>All the clichés/stereotypes are used over and over again. Poorly choreographed action sequences, overacting, laughable attempts at local accent and the dialog taken straight out of Hammer classics. The plot is probably written by his 8-year old nephew.<br/><br/>Draculas brides are laying eggs ?! (the castle feels more like something taken from ""Aliens"" than 17th century). And as for Dracula - there is ""The Daddy"" of all the evil creatures,the very name should cause fear. In Van Helsing we have the pleasure of seeing one of the worst casting choice for the role ever (at least for production this big - Dracula is supposed to appear menacing while this one looks like Elton Johns new lover or some Liberace wannabe! I was expecting a scene where he bites Van Helsings balls,not the neck. <br/><br/>One thing is certain - after watching this crap,I will never look at those creatures,even this type of films again."
"Dr_Strangelove1","1","2","4","10 November 2004"," Very bad, yet very funny (in a bad way).
","Being a big MST3K fan, I enjoyed ridiculing this movie for over 2 hours. The evil Dracula reminded me of Riverdance and his love nest of women obviously enjoyed ""acting"" to the 10th power. Van Helsing's side kick was dropping bad jokes left & right, but after 45 minutes you just wanted him to die. Van Helsing tried to be cool, and suave he is not! Just watch the scene when he plops his ten-gallon hat on Anna's head and you will know what I mean. The acting was horrible and the director is to blame because some of the cast has a descent track record. For those familiar with the Black Adder episode ""Sense & Senility"", well its like the cast of this movie had been coached by the Shakespearian actors Mr. Keanrich & Mr. Mossop :)<br/><br/>Watching Van Helsing on DVD was also educational for me. I'm no audio guru, but I now know what bad audio production is! During the few scenes that didn't contain any CG monsters or action, the dialogue would literally fade out when certain sound effects took place (like the 'sheen' of a sword being drawn). I should also mention the horrible over dubs and lip syncs. They were so bad that I felt like I was watching MXC! Cool! :)<br/><br/>The CG had potential in some areas. I enjoyed the 1st werewolf scene and a coupe of shots towards the end when Dracula's little demons were flying about the village, but over all I wasn't impressed considering the talent displayed on other films that required lots of CG. The compositing and camera tracking were weak.<br/><br/>Finally, the music. Just plain awful considering the genre of this film. The score might have worked for a Summer Olympics broadcast back in the 80's, but... Ahhh, forget it.<br/><br/>1 out of 10."
"BaronBl00d","Null","2","4","7 November 2004"," Dracula Isn't the Only Thing That Sucks!
","I'm a classic horror/monster fan. I grew up with Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the wolfman, the mummy, and all those fondly remembered others. I have learned through the years that film makers cannot cater to an older crowd and their nostalgic images of what some particular thing should be like. That's fine. I can live with that. But when something is as perverted as this and tries to seem like it is something from the past. That bothers me. Supposedly Van Helsing in the late 1800's has weapons we have not dreamed of here. He has super human skills such as great agility and strength. Those are explained later in the film for the few that still might care after the mindless barrage of CGI effects and one-liners. This isn't a horror film. This is another action film like what Stephen Sommers did in The Mummy films only done with less integrity to the source material and with lesser talents working toward greater expectations. I remember distinctly saying after seeing the Mr. Hyde segment early in the film that""This movie sucks big time!"" That said after less than ten to fifteen minutes into the film. From there things only got worse. Sure I could go on and on about the ridiculous script, the one dimensional acting, Kate Beckinsdale's accent(at least she is a treat to look at!), the over-used CGI effects for action scenes and settings, the Van Helsing poor man Indiana Jones mixed with supernatural powers creation, and so much more. What could be said for the film? Like all of Sommers work, it is watchable if nothing else. Most of the dialogue is inane but never seems to take itself too seriously. Of all the creatures, the Frankenstein's monster(here unbelievably called Frankenstein!)had the truest sense of what the character was suppose to be. David Wendham shined as a monk with technology that would make James Bond's Q pale in comparison. And Sommers obviously tries to pay homage to the great Universal movie monsters - rather unsuccessfully I think - but tries nonetheless. He also pays homage to Roman Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers with a nice ballroom scene reminiscent of that film. When all is said and done; however, I really felt bad having seen the film. Not because it wasn't entertaining. It was to a degree, but more because of what it could have been, what it should have been, and what it would have been if Sommers and Universal had had the guts and backbone to not cater to 15 year-olds exclusively."

","I don't know if Sommers is trying to be campy and retarded when he made this or if he really thinks he made a scary movie...either way this piece of junk was painful to sit through. The scariest thing throughout was THE DIALOGUE, it sounded as if Sommer's 12 yr old nephew wrote most of it. The acting was expectedly bad but Dracula was so over the top, that I found myself fast forwarding through his parts (yes I rented, no way in hell was I going to pay nine dollars to see this). <br/><br/>The plot was completely predictable as most of Sommers films are, the special effects were outlandish - part of the reason of a no scare factor is that almost all the monsters were cgi'd in, looking more like cartoons, than anything else. The old horror films Sommers is trying to pay homage to had waaaayyyy more class this his modern day crapnanza. <br/><br/>Save yourself the pain of this film, its not a good horror flick, its a lousy action flick, there's no real comedy, and drama...well you'd get more drama from watching cspan than this thing...surprisingly the DVD does make a good frisbee."

Just another ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". Lots of special effects and good actors wasting their time with a lousy script.

Hottie Kate Beckinsale plays the love interest of Van Helsing's and Richard Roxburgh is the Count himself. Unlike the ""Mummy"" movies, ""Van Helsing"" rarely takes time to develop character. It's pretty much a hyper-kinetic, non-stop action ride.<br/><br/>Music composer Jerry Goldsmith's score is bombastic and over-the-top, much like the picture itself. The film's opening scene, a virtuoso segment shot in b & w, pays homage to the classic Universal Monster movies. The climatic fight between Van Helsing and Dracula is pretty silly, but it's probably the only weak aspect of a film I mostly enjoyed. ""Van Helsing"" was mostly ravaged my critics, but if you're looking for a slick, state-of-the-art, yet dopey action movie. This film will most likely satisfy your thirst. It's great fun. *** out of ****"

","I want to know who it was that decided that great films had to be ""great cinema.""  If anyone in Hollywood believes that their job is to do anything more than entertain the ignorant masses, then they have a vastly over-inflated view of their own value to anyone.  ""Great Cinema"" rarely makes for a great film, great entertainment always does.  And that brings me to the topic at hand: Van Helsing.  <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and company aren't going to win any Oscars for this film.  It is most decidedly NOT ""great cinema"" or even ""Mediocre cinema.""  What it is is the most fun and entertaining movie I've seen in a couple of years.  And that includes all of the Lord of the Rings films, Spider-Man (1 & 2), Troy, the Scorpion King, the X-men films, etc.  All of which I liked.  Van Helsing was a non-serious, period-super-hero-action film that never even tries to be art.  Which is good, because it would have stunk if it had. <br/><br/>
You can't beat a movie set in the late 1800's that still manages to have explosions, monsters, and a Gatling crossbow.  And there are quite a few very funny one-liners scattered throughout the film.  Van Helsing doesn't take itself seriously in the least and it shouldn't have to. <br/><br/>
Sadly, this is another movie going the way of Waterworld.  A very entertaining film whose profits have been ruined by idiot critics who are actually looking for ""Great Cinema."""

","Being THE BIGGEST vampire & Dracula fan EVER i couldn't wait to see this film - was i disappointed? NO WAY! This is my favourite film this year!

","Van Helsing is a wonderful popcorn movie, and you're bound to enjoy it if you're not going in looking to rip it to pieces. Like the previous Mummy movies, the plot is treacle...but with every corner there's a fantastic action sequence that goes on forever. The main thing with Van Helsing is that it makes no quips about what it is...and then the movie delivers in spades. A lot of spades. Saying that there is a tremendous action sequence every five minutes or so is not exaggerating..! There are plenty - plenty - of cool, elaborate battles, very well executed and shot beautifully. The film itself is absolutely gorgeous to look at - the scenery playing probably the most important role in the film. If you like Gothic, fog-enshrouded landscapes along the lines of Hammer films - then you're in for a treat. Van Helsing is set not only amongst a beautiful, beautiful backdrop of foggy landscapes...but also has a very nice nod to the old B&W Universal sets as well. The cinematography and scenery are worth the price of admission alone - for those with a classic eye. If you're trained in your classic horror films and literature, you're bound to appreciate the effort put into this piece a great deal more than someone who, say, was raised on Terminator and NFL. The negative word of mouth I've been hearing seems to be coming mainly from cultureless lunk-heads who haven't researched anything before 1977. Do not pay attention to them - Van Helsing is a real crowd pleaser, and an awful lot of work on every level went into this film. There's not only beautiful scenery and sets - the monsters are really gorgeous. The brides of Dracula are really something - and the battles with them are fantastic. The actors are all gorgeous, as well - but the director has a good eye for character...none of these people are good looking in your typical, bland, storefront means. They're lovely in the sense that they're people that you would genuinely be attracted and endeared to...rather than a flavorless sculpted Barbie or Ken. The writing allows for just a minimum of character development...but, honestly - it's just popcorn...and if you're looking for more than a great looking, high-flying action movie - then you're in the wrong seats. But - if you know what you're getting yourself into, and want to have an absolutely wild ride..! Van Helsing is a wonderful summer action movie...and good word should be spread about this baby, so we can at least get another one..! And by the way...the lusty soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is the very best movie music out there right now..! No kidding - the music is delectable. Most everything in Van Helsing works - just don't go in being a knob...or you're not gonna get it at all. It's a blast!"

","If you go into this movie expecting anything beyond a popcorn flick like INDEPENDENCE DAY or Sommers' MUMMY movies, you're destined to be disappointed. It's eye candy, folks, pure and simple. All style, with just enough substance to keep it interesting. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was perfectly cast for the role, as were Beckinsale and Wenham.<br/><br/>Without putting in any spoilers, I just wish we'd had a little more of Van Helsing's background, and I'd still love to see Anna in the sequel (and you know there will be one). Wenham's Carl is good comic relief, essentially being Van Helsing's Q for the duration. All three have picked up their roles with gusto, and it shows.<br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh is the only real drawback here. His Dracula has no charisma, no seduction, no gravitas, no menace, and no darkness about him. I wonder if the reactions to this movie might have been better if Dracula here had been a little more of the traditional menacing, seductive, dangerous Dracula.<br/><br/>To those folks that were expecting accuracy to the literary characters, I'm sorry, but it should have been obvious from the trailers that that wasn't coming. Although, it was one of the more accurate screen representations of Frankenstein's monster to date.<br/><br/>All in all, not perfect, but above-average. 7.5/10."

"soniagoenaga25","10","2","4","20 May 2004"," An interesting film with the best Dracula, an incredibly sexy Richard Roxburgh, I have ever seen, apart from Chistopher Lee, of course!
","I have recently seen Van Helsing, film which I really enjoyed due to different factors. In the first place it is absolutely original the mixture of the three classical monsters of the universal literature, Dracula (excellent Richard Roxburgh), Frankenstein and the Werewolf. Never have I seen such an adventure, my God! From the beginning to the end the whole film catches the attention of the audience and it is totally impossible to get bored. Despite what some critics say about this movie, there are very good things that critics do not want to accept, for example, the story, as I said above, is very creative, not only because of the mixture of the three monsters, but also because it shows perfectly the atmosphere of Transilvania created by the great imagination of Bram Stoker. In addition to this I must say that thanks to the brilliant perfomance of all the cast, but specially thanks to the highly attractive Australian actors Richard Roxburgh, whom I consider the best and sexiest Dracula I have ever seen (with the permission of the great Christopher Lee), and Hugh Jackman, another Aussie who plays very well his role as Van Helsing and whose transformation as a werefolf suits on him very wel, I did not get bored while watching it. Another question, is it a coincidence that both  masculine roles are played by Australian boys? (It is very well-known that men from Australia are very handsome. I have also read some commentaries in which a boy from Poland said that Richard Roxburgh is not very good as Dracula, does this mean that this Polish boy could do it better than Richard? Of course not. I would add another thing, Richard plays very  well his role and moreover, neither Bela Lugosi nor other actors in the same role, have never had the same glamour as Richard. He has an air of romanticism which gives him the impression of being a human being with feelings and a sense of pain due to its constant battle between Evil and Good. In conclussion, it is not just a fascinating film to see but also an adventure plenty of action, love and good perfomances. I liked it so much that in fact, I am going to see it again. All the cast is brilliant but for me personally Richard is the best and deserves all the best in this world in which it is very difficult to have a main role in Hollywood when being a foreigner."
"Lindzvergil","10","2","4","13 May 2004"," To suck, or not to suck...
","No matter what any one says, I think that Van Helsing is the best film with its content (such as horror) since The Mummy, and, The Mummy Returns.<br/><br/>The CGI graphics are produced really well and the actors played their parts magnificently. Castle Frankinstein is in Geneva, and not in Transylvania. But that does not bring the story line down, and, makes the film entertaining. I did jump out of my seat a few times because all of the monsters jumped out the shadows when you least expected it!"
"soniagoenaga25","10","2","4","17 May 2004"," A very interesting movie
","Last week I saw 'Van Helsing' and to tell you the truth I really think that critics are very bad with his comments about this film. Lots of them think that this is just a film for having a good time and nothing else, but in my opinion there are some things which must be considered. In the first place, the combination of the three monsters, Dracula (the sexiest Dracula I have ever seen, much better and more attractive than others),Frankestein and the Warewolfman is original and it  has  never seen in movies such a mixture of three different stories. On the other hand, the story itself is not only original but also interesting because it catches the attention of the audience and from the beginning to the end everybody is expecting what is going to happen. But the best thing is the perfomance of the Australian actors Richard Roxburgh (an incredibly fascinating vampire)and Hugh Jackman (a very funny and interesting hero. Both of them are perfect as enemies whose interest is to destroy each other, although I would have personally preferred Dracula to have won the battle, ha,ha,ha. Is it a coincidence that both sexy characters like Van Helsing and Dracula are played by Australian perfomers? This confirms that men from this nation are very handsome."

","Pretty-looking movie EXTREMELY loosely based on someone's inaccurate conception of what Transylvania is like. This is one of those movies tailored to look good at the expense of the amount of realism that would be appropriate. But remember, Hungarians don't really sound like that, Dracula did not really live in the years given, and (believe it or not) Halloween is not and never was celebrated in Hungary, no matter how obligatory the holiday may seem in a ""scary"" movie. If you think Kate Beckinsale is hot, then by all means see it, but don't look if you don't want to feel embarrassed by her poor acting or accent (and, after being surrounded by real Hungarians in Underworld, she had no excuse). Enjoy."
"bondfan27","9","2","4","15 May 2004"," Werewolves, Vampires, And Frankenstein! O My! 'Van Helsing' Is A Monsterous-ly Good Time! * * * 1/2 (Out Of 4 Stars)
","I remember all the way back to the good ol' days of B&W, where Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr. ruled the horror silver screen. Nowadays, horror has expanded to evil maniacs, crazy monsters, and oddball zombie flicks. It's just not as scary as they 3 originals did it. Thank god that Steven Sommers (Of 'The Mummy' fame) has brought the 3 classic monsters: Drac, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein, back to the silver screen to rule over again. In ""Van Helsing"" I found myself at awe with the film. Hype has lead it to be this summers first blockbuster. With summer blockbusters you get a great mix of: action, comedy, special effects, and of course, the loose plot. Summer blockbusters were never meant to be analyzed. They were made just to go in, have some popcorn, and come out smiling. ""Van Helsing"" is the perfect example of a summer blockbuster. Hugh Jackman is charming and exciting as Gabriel Van Helsing, who's life work is to rid the world of monsters. Working for a secret society in Rome, he must travel to Translyvania to fight Dracula. What he comes upon is much more. There he meets more then just one vampire, but three more: Dracula's brides. He also runs into Frankenstein, who we find out was ""created by and for evil, but not ruled by it"", making the monster a gentle creature who just wants to help Van Helsing. Kate Beckinsale, who was just hot of the success of ""Underworld"" as a vampire as turned her roles right around, as the beautiful Anna Valerious, the last of the Valerious' who's life's work is to rid the world of Dracula as well. On their way, they run into the Wolfman, who is all special effect, and rightfully so, since it fits. I enjoyed how the transformation of man to wolf starts. Don't expect special effects from the original 'The Wolfman'. And of course, Dracula, played by Richard Roxborough doesn't quite hit the mark on his impression of Dracula (Or Bela). You, willingly or not, will automatically try a comparison to him and Lugosi. Does he top it? No, but he adds a new, more sadistic sense to the image. I did enjoy his performance. The film, a special effects extravaganza, is one of the most impressive works as FX goes. Amazing shots of Rome, Translyvania mountains, and inside masquerades make the locations amazing. The monsters, most of the pure FX are impressive, yet corny. The vampires switch from human-like form to more demon-vampire mode. When they do, they grow giant mouthfuls of fangs, about a foot long each. It looks hokey, but still fun to smile at. Like I was saying it being the perfect summer blockbuster: it's true. Amazing special effects light up and ignite the action throughout the film, the plot acts hokey, dumb, silly, but highly enjoyable, and also it is loose. Very loose. You will question scenes and moments at least more then twice to yourself. I tip my hat to Stephen Sommers, who keeps the film on fire from beginning to end. It also kept my mind spinning from beginning to end as well. Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr. would be proud.<br/><br/>My Rating:   * * * 1/2 (Out Of Four) 8 (Out Of 10 On The IMDB) A- (A+=Highest, F=Lowest)"
"smit815","9","2","4","15 May 2004"," Loved the Movie
","Kind of like Indiana Jones Meets Frankenstein ( and a lot of other horror monsters). Kate Beckinsale was gorgeous. The plot was good and well written. The acting was good (not great), but the special effects was well done.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the protryal of Frankenstein as basically good. And the actor playing Carl reminded me of Danny Kaye and was the glue that held the picture together. In fact I would say he stole the show.<br/><br/>If you like good wholesome monsterous adventure, then I recommend the movie So I am very surprised that most of the voters (with whom I agree 90% of the time) have rated this movie so low. I cannot see anyone rating this less than a 7. Even so I give it a 9.<br/><br/>Andy Smith"

It takes you on an awesome adventure, including all of the fictional ""monsters"" one could hope for. For the entire movie I could not take my eyes away from the screen and it captivated me for the whole two hours. It is action packed and the actors did a terrific job of portraying their characters. My particular favorite was David Wenham. Definitely a big difference from playing Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" and I give him props for that. I have no complaints whatsoever concerning the movie although I do have to say this: I was very upset when I heard people talking about how the special effects looked fake. I do not believe this at all and I advise you to ignore any ignorant person who states that rumor. I strongly encourage you to go see ""Van Helsing""."
"mike_l","Null","2","4","10 May 2004"," Should be judged for what it is ...
","It's not terribly good and not so awfully bad ... it's certainly much better than League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (LXG) - both suffer from trying to have too many 'characters' (heroes or baddies) in them but VH comes off better. For me the film has less impact from having so many different baddies with their own already established histories and mythologies: Jekyll & Hyde, Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein. One the plus side this makes them more immediately accessable (unlike LXG where I, at least, was not familiar with all the characters (LXG were an unlikely bunch in a different way to this slightly less unlikely bunch)). Sadly in VH there is little plot and little character development. VH's first monster is Mr Hyde who for some reason is wandering around Notre Dame in Paris (it could be that in the Jekyll and Hyde story he does go to Paris I really don't remember to be honest - however as the rest of the film didn't pay real homage to the characters I was expecting a hunchback to be the first monster to be dispatched lol) ... The special effects are very overdone (Hyde looks like a Mr Universe caricature). The first Wolfman was the best and things held together OK up to here as far as things went. The plot and dialogue were pretty awful and it's just the action that kept it ticking along - even though it's pretty over the top (OTT). The oddest thing in the movie? Dracula trying to raise a vampire army using the technology that brought Frankenstein to life. Whoever designed the GC for the vampire babies? It was awful - they looked like luminous fat vampire jelly babies. Still it kept my attention for the duration. The music got annoying - it even overpowered everything else at times (bear in mind that everything else is pretty OTT). I didn't go to this movie with any great expectations and I would question the maturity of anyone who raves about it (you may think this Rocks is you are a 14 year old boy). Despite all its flaws its watchable enough once if you are just after an action / FX / monster movie from hollywood to entertain you for a while (it overdelivers on all 3 at the expense of characters and plot but is enjoyable enough). The friar was the best character. Dracula just reminded me too much of bono (which didn't work). Dunno what they were thinking with Frankenstein - laughed when he had to put his head back in shape - but he was just too nice for a monster. Wolfman worked well enough. Jekyll/Hyde no comment. Hunback of Notre Dame should have been in it! Vampires - done well enough, though their extending gaping jaws were a bit much. VH - OK. Anna - OKish. Overall bit disappointing but enjoyable enough - better thank Hulk & LXG. 5.5/10"

"thedevilyouknow00","1","2","4","8 May 2004"," Use of Icons does not Imply Homage
","The first indication of trouble was the fact that this movie was not in anamorphic widescreen (Cinemascope), but rather 1.85:1 ratio- all the better for its afterlife in Home Video, I suppose. By not going with a Scope, the film has already told me it lacks ambition and for something that is going to use vampires, and werewolves and other monsters, you NEED ambition. Already, this movie is in trouble and I have not seen a single frame.  But that didn't take long.  Because it commits its first cardinal sin with the character of Dracula.<br/><br/>Dracula is an icon. He's smooth, attractive, mystery hiding untold malevolence under that seductive and dangerous exterior. He speaks very little in his movies because he doesn't have to- his eyes and facial structure do that. A quick look at Bela Lugosi, Chris Lee, or Gary Oldman communicates the visual power of Dracula.  Dracula as portrayed by Richard Roxburgh is a z-grade villain and conjures NONE of the power or allure of the Draculas of old.  He's a meglomaniacal twit that wouldn't be out of place in a Die Hard rip-off. Visually, he wears black, and not in such a w ay that shocks you or gets your eyes open, but it's a formless black suit that seems far too grounded in reality to be frightening. And he talks too much, which wouldn't be a problem but what he says is bad. Worse than Prequel bad. The force that's going to drive this film is hobbled, fatally so with a hideous visual. And Dracula never drinks blood in this film. How can you have a Dracula that doesn't drink blood?  It's one of his stock terrors- people fear Dracula because he'll drink their blood!  I can't be afraid of something that isn't going to be scary! But the movie soon works its way into other sins. We have a Mr. Hyde that has some of the worse CGI in recent memory, worse than... Oh take your pick. And then we get into the logic flaws: like taking a boat to Transylvania, a LANDLOCKED region!!! Where we met the inhabitants of a village. That, by their own admission, serves as cattle for Dracula and his brides.  I say cattle because they do nothing but run in terror like cow- whereas humans would look for places to hide. Where they might not get say... eaten by these flying 'Brides of Dracula.' Who are ugly. In a multi-million dollar picture, I want hot babes. They're recruiting in LA, I know there is no shortage of babes in LA so when you can't get hot babes for a big picture like this, the movie is SCREWED. Of course, I paid to experience this... including the acting. Which is godawful. Hugh Jackman has displayed more than a modicum of talent in the past, which is evident nowhere in this film. He maintains the same bad accent and hammy tone for the whole picture. And who did his hair? While long flowing locks may look great on the covers of romance novels, but this 1980s-reject style is woefully out of place. Kate Beckinsale has a great ass however, and it is wonderful to watch it. Far better than looking at her perpetually constipated facial expression.  Some people think she's emoting pain of... whatever. By the time I've seen her face for the tenth time or so, I'm bored and thinking of happier things. Like car wrecks. Or plane crashes. And a final condemnation. I'm not sure if this was put in to pander to the Born-agains, but what the hell is a Christianity element doing here? Jackman crosses himself many a time and Beckinsale at one point says, 'God help us.' Only, this isn't a display of the faith of characters questioning or seeking solace, its just words and motions thrown out there to try and get the audience to imagine that these characters really have come to a point of desperation. Virtual faith if you will, all the elements are there but it's essentially empty of meaning. The whole film is empty, there's lots of stuff in it to try and invoke fond memories but it fails. The filmmakers don't give any of elements any meaning or weight. Everything in this movie is a pointless tool to sell toys and games and...junk. There's no love for our memories of these characters or the meanings they've accumulated over the decades.

","First of all I'd like to clear some things up about me. I am a major sci-fi, horror and fantasy fan. I loved X-Men 1 & 2, I thought that no one could play my fave character Wolverine better than Hugh Jackman. I liked Underworld since I am a fan of Whitewolf, I love dark settings and Kate Beckinsale was out of this world. I also enjoyed both Mummies. They are fun, with a basic plot and enjoyable characters. What I call a perfect pop-corn movie. Watching the trailer of Van Helsing, I hoped that I would see another enjoyable pop-corn movie with two good actors.<br/><br/>DAMN I WAS WRONG.<br/><br/>It would take me hours to describe why this movie was the first one in lots of years that was begging me to leave the building running and screaming in agony.<br/><br/>The script is a big hole. It's as simple and chaotic as a bad dream you may have after eating a big steak for dinner and you haven't digested well. My best guess is that it was still being written while they were filming it and they were adding random scenes to it.<br/><br/>A few things I can remember. The monk Q (James Bond), part of a secret society in Vatican that shelters Buddhist explosive experts, Mormon weapon designers and Muslims testing CHAINGUNS, tours VH through the latest weaponry, showing him some cool explosive he came up with and the flash bomb he just discovered that emits sunlight but can't find a use for it (Blade and James Bond rip-off in one scene, wow).<br/><br/>Frankenstein is a cuddly bear with british accent (did he pick that up in Romania Cambridge school?), Dracula (or T-1000 judging from the way he walks out of fire) could as well be an American Pie character (he's THAT silly), his helpers are Ewoks/Dwarves (where is Snow-white or Luke?) with Slipknot/Sand People masks, his brides are always posing (waving their hands and bodies in a stupid way) when trying to act just like in old b/w movies with no sound, everyone has a stupid Romanian accent, everyone is acting worst than soap operas (including Jack and Kate). You'll see everyone jumping through wires and falling on the ground without a scratch (a lot like Spiderman, including the camera movement), you'll see Dracula's children straight out of Gremlins, you'll notice their hives resembling the Matrix ""human batteries"", you'll laugh at the 10 arrows/sec crossbow, you'll scream ""yo ho ho"" when the horses and carriage fly over a broken bridge and I am sure I am still forgetting lots of things. It's not bad to the point of making you laugh, it's bad to the point of making you angry.<br/><br/>I swear, there were people around me who fell asleep at some point.<br/><br/>Ed Wood would be proud of his followers (or perhaps just laugh at them). You have to see it to believe how awful it is..."

"syvergy","1","2","4","7 May 2004"," Probably the worst movie since Battlefield Earth.
","Probably the biggest mistake most people make is excusing crap action movies, as ""popcorn"" or ""mindless"" flicks. Wrong. Bad movies are bad because they are badly made. Van Helsing prompted me to register on this site because my disgust could not be contained. This movie is utter crap.<br/><br/>Lets do a rundown. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman, again, doing a moody, withkept ragged drifter character) is a monster slayer. He travels around Europe, with the support of the Vatican(?), getting rid of those that are deemed evil. After defeating one of these creatures (Dr. Jekyl, in a completely dumbed down, and, unfortunately, one of the better fight scenes in the whole movie), he is sent off to kill the ellustrious Dracula (Played melodramically by Richard Roxbury). Along for the ride is a no-name actor friar, as he repeatedly liked to be regarded, supplying such 19th centure weaponry as an automatic crossbow and a light grenade (anyone who DIDNT see when this would be used deserved to be shot), and awful ""comic"" relief.<br/><br/>We're treated to about 10 seconds of backstory, which is just to introduce Kate Beckansale as the helpless heroine, and we're off on a ride of plot holes, bad CGI (except for the werewolves), horrible scriptwriting and just as horrible directing. Besides ripping off every single classic monster movie ever made, Director Sommers managed to turn the stuff he stole into complete dredge. One liners like ""We transelvians tend to see the bridge side of death"" and ""She's DEAD"" occupy the intelligence of 95% of anything said. It's all cringeworthy. As the movie wears on, fight scenes are repeated over and over again. The evil deeds, in which Dracula and his 3 wives (screeching away) wish to re-populate their dying kind, are repeated. Twice. We've never told why they need to electrocute wearwolves to do it, nor why Frankensteins monster, but they do. Twice.<br/><br/>We also see our heroes plummit through walls, bounce off trees (without as much as a scratch), swing on ropes far, far too much, and manage to accomplish jumps and flips that would make the chinese midget from ""Oceans Eleven"" look impressed. But I'll be fair. The production values were enormous, and the sets, costumes and some of the CGI look fantastic. But thats it, they only look fantastic, when put into practical use, you can almost see the $130 million fall down the drain.<br/><br/>I won't bother to go into any more of the movie's ""story"", since there isn't much more to say. The so called ""surprises"" are rolled over by explosions so you won't notice them, what happens to Kate Beckansale is simply retarded, and the ending is nothing short of, well, lame. Which, co-incidentally, sums up the entire movie.<br/><br/>All in all, save your money. Do not see this movie. Do not even rent it. Instead, rent out some of the classics like ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" that this movie shameless tries to rip off. They may not be modern, but they are a hell of a lot better then this piece of commercially manufactured dredge."
"davidmvining","5","0","0","7 July 2020"," A Guilty Pleasure
","This is not what I would call a good movie. It's characters are too thin, the romance too contrived, the structure too loose, and the theme too scattershot, but what it lacks in some of the basic building blocks of storytelling it partially makes up for in charm and a deep seeded desire to entertain no matter what. Those two aspects make Stephen Sommers' Van Helsing something of a guilty pleasure for me. No, it's not good, but I enjoy it every time I watch it.<br/><br/>Delving into the story is an exercise not really worth the effort because it's too manically told with the passion of an adolescent hopped upon Red Bull and Mountain Dew, throwing his toys together with a shocking amount of energy at two in the morning. Essentially, Gabriel (not Abraham) Van Helsing is a monster hunter working for Rome, and he carries the burden of being called a murderer because everyone sees the results of his work but not the efforts. It's a question that the movie brings up from time to time but has little to not ability to expand upon beyond the initial ask. It's not concerned with Van Helsing as a man but as a vehicle through which to drive the audience through the plot and hang a couple of mysterious questions about his past that area supposed to add to the overall mystery.<br/><br/>He gets sent to Transylvania along with Carl, a friar who ends up acting as Q to the James Bond that is Van Helsing, supplying him with weapons along the way. Carl is one of the biggest sources of fun in the film. He's the fish out of water, not a field man, and he's played really wittily by David Wenham. When he doesn't seem to be having a blast, he's amusingly out of his element with a creaky voice that barley conceals pure terror.<br/><br/>In Transylvania, Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious, a Romanian princess descended from a long line of hunters out to kill Dracula. Her brother gets turned into a werewolf and she helps Van Helsing fight off an attack of three flying Brides of Dracula. The basic plot is that Dracula is trying to use the technology that brought Frankenstein's monster to life in order to bring his large cadre of dead-born children to life. There are chases, fights, explosions, and all manner of chaos.<br/><br/>The movie's best sequence comes late at a masquerade ball where Dracula has captured Anna and is trying to trade her for Frankenstein's monster that Van Helsing has found. It's a visual delight with acrobatics, dancing, singing, and special effects. The movie's ultimate climax in Dracula's castle makes the mistake of having both the hero and the villain transform into CGI monsters, robbing the audience of investment in the conflict by hiding the faces of those we've spent time with, but since there's no real investment to be had, it's not as bad as it could have been.<br/><br/>Really, it's not good. I went back and found Roger Ebert's three star review of the film, and I agree with everything he said. However, I just can't quite say that even though I have a good time with the film that it's actually good. That's all I need, right? To have a good time? Well, it's thin entertainment that doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, the sort of thing I couldn't watch too frequently because the sloppy construction would get to me.<br/><br/>It's a guilty pleasure, and I have no real problem admitting that."

","Universal's greatest monsters are back, this time in a monster mash unlike any other. Stephen Sommers, director of ""The Mummy"", brings a new set of rules and updates to his creatures and makes Van Helsing an awesome, well-equipped action hero. So let's spread our wings, charge up, and take a bite into this action-packed creature feature.<br/><br/>Plot: Dracula, the Prince of Darkness, had Dr. Frankenstein create his monster for a nefarious purpose, but the vampire lord loses both the good doctor and his creation. A year later, having finished business in Paris (Mr. Hyde), monster hunter Van Helsing, alongside his genius sidekick Carl, is sent by the Knights of the Holy Order to Transylvania to kill Dracula while protecting Princess Anna from him. However, Dracula has three brides, a werewolf, and other creatures under his control. With the help of Carl, Anna, and Frankenstein's monster, Van Helsing sets out to stop this monster madness with an arsenal of crazy weapons and an attitude to match.<br/><br/>This is a great tribute to the classic monster movies. Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster have great updates, cool designs, and unique twists to their characters. Van Helsing is tough as nails and Anna is both sexy and strong. Both characters do have soft spots, especially for each other. Carl, along with many other things in this movie, is pretty darn funny. It's great the way all these characters are tied together in this crazy battle for the fate of the world.<br/><br/>With a complex story, nice effects, fun music, good comedy, and awesome action scenes, this movie is sure to please. A must-see film. Check it out. Be sure to bring stakes, crosses, silver bullets, and fire."

The chills are spreading further as Alan Silvestri's score kicks in and expedition to 1887 becomes a sole point of your attention for the next couple of hours.
The tones are dark, cold and bearing a constant brand of terror, which is sustained with amazing attention to the details: you are surrounded with so many tiny as well as enormous XIX century items that sliding glance from the screen raises an out-of-time bewilderment.

"DarthVoorhees","7","0","0","27 March 2016"," Fun in a 'Batman & Robin' kind of way...
","I'll be honest 'Van Helsing' is a hard movie to review. I totally see both ends of the spectrum. It can be a very fun movie when one looks at it's corny audacity and monster set pieces. And yet it's just too much to ask for a whole hearted straight faced recommendation because that dialogue... I kind of hate and love this movie for a lot of different reasons some of which conflict with one another. In the end I can't quite condemn it because it's too much stupid fun.<br/><br/>There is no getting around the fact that it has one of the stupidest half-assed written scripts for any huge summer blockbuster. There are moments in this movie where Stephen Sommers writes himself into traps and a vampire will pop literally out of nowhere because he has no idea of anything else to do. My all time personal favorite moment is when he has no idea how to get our heroes to Dracula's castle so a painting suddenly becomes a portal. The characters are so shallow that whenever Sommers tries to squeeze in some personality or motivation it becomes jarring and hilarious. The Transylvanian Princess Anna remarks that she has never been to the sea as they explore Frankenstein's ruins. It's ineptness reaches a climax in the big finale when Hugh Jackman doesn't actually fight Dracula. He turns into appalling CGI werewolf. I felt kind of ripped off. It's bad screen writing 101.<br/><br/>And yet as far as stupid movies go this one is kind of entertaining in that it so sincerely believes it's smart. Hugh Jackman is the reason 'Van Helsing' retains just enough serious to laugh with and not at the film. If Sommers had Brendan Fraiser again this movie would have been a disaster. Jackman is perfect here. He is entertaining and adds the right amount and right kind of humor to his performance. <br/><br/>I don't know. All my criticism and smiles come down to me being a huge Universal Monster fan. This movie loves the iconography of the monsters. You definitely see where the money went on this thing. The sets and make-up effects are all spectacular. The cobwebs, the Transylvanian villages, the laboratory. I can't help but smile at it. The opening ten minutes alone are worth the price of admission. The movie only truly gets boring when it is loaded with CGI.<br/><br/>...and yet on the other hand I can't help but be a little angry that Universal thinks this and 'Dracula Untold' is how to honor their monster heritage. Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Lon Chaney Jr never played characters as superficial as these in any of the Universal classics. Everything is at face value here. The iconography? Beautiful. The mythology? They don't have a clue as to what made these characters appeal to monster fans. <br/><br/>I understand the hate this movie gets but I think it's far too stupid to devote any passionate loathing to. I loved it as a kid when it first came out and looking back at it I can still sort of see why I did. It's goofy and has fun being goofy. It's a 'Batman & Robin' caliber watch. You'll be entertained I think if you sort of smirk at it."
"mullaryn","7","0","0","3 May 2009"," The mad adrenaline and non-stop action makes up for the at best weak plot.
","I'm not certain why so many people hated this movie. I think it's because they expected something fantastic, Oscar-material, CGI laden action with deep philosophical ruminations, etc...<br/><br/>No. Van Helsing isn't like that. The plot is at it's very best weak, there are obvious stupidities, and the acting, while not at all bad, is really unremarkable. But Van Helsing makes up for it by having boundless energy. The movie doesn't stop for one moment, piling acting upon action upon action sequences. All of that stuff about automatic crossbows, miniature bombs, and life-experiments... that's all bull. Of course it is. But it looks extremely good on screen, so just accept it and enjoy the fast-paced action.<br/><br/>The acting... well, varied. Princess Anna was quite unconvincing to me. Too much pathos and drama, not enough regality (although again, that's just my opinion). Van Helsing, Carl, and Velkan were all on the level, convincing, and sometimes even very good (I particularly like that little line after Van Helsing shoots quite a few baby vampires. 'Now that I have your attention'.) Count Dracula was quite brilliant, and I believe that is the best role of vampire/scientist gone mad I have seen. His evil is believable, and his manner of speech is perfect for the role: a bit drawling, aloof, mocking. Best of all, he actually LOOKS the part. He is quite tall, equine, and there is the mark of those graced with aristocratic disregard for human life.<br/><br/>Should you watch Van Helsing? Sure. But not if you need a quiet night in. Gather around with some friends, watch it on a big screen with good surround sound.<br/><br/>7/10"

Yes, they were dumb, but they were a whole lot of fun.<br/><br/>I wasn't aware that it was Sommers who directed Van Helsing until the end credits, and I have to say that I just don't get him.<br/><br/>You have a semi-homage to the classic Universal horror movies, mainly Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolf Man, still, it's all jumbled up into something that wants to pass as plot, that I don't fully understand no matter how many times I see it.<br/><br/>Abraham Van Helsing, the vampires scholar, is turned into Gabriel Van Helsing, sort of a James Bond/Batman from Transylvania, with all kinds of gadgets and technology that I doubt existed by that time.<br/><br/>The movie starts sort of sci-fi with the thinnest and most insulting homage to Frankenstein at the beginning, then has more of an action tone with Van Helsing's fight against Mr. Hyde, and halfway through involves a Gothic (and graphic) horror style that becomes confusing. It has some comic relief mixed with creepy and disturbing CGI morphing sequences, including multiple werewolf transformations, and also spectacular stunts.<br/><br/>There is some sort of back story involving a family's quest to kill Dracula, and Gabriel's past, but it sounds too epic to be an action flick.<br/><br/>All of this makes me wonder, what the hell is this? Action? Horror? Comedy? Camp? The musical score by Alan Silvestri is quite amusing and exciting (and brief in CD) as it seems to be the only coherent aspect of this troubled production.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is indeed fun and somehow watchable, except for the previously mentioned transformation scenes and too many vampire jaws opening longer than physically possible (something we already saw in lesser extent in ""The Mummy""). It's a bad movie, but if there's nothing else to see or do, you can watch it and spend time trying to figure out what genre it is. ""Acthorror"", ""horredy"", ""gothcamp""?"

There is even a James Bond type Q Branch with new weapons.

Then I happened to watch the opening scene. This movie has no plot that could engage anyone with half a brain, mixes up lore and myth (when I go to the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris I expect to see Quasimodo, not Mr.Hyde of Edinburgh, especially as the former is at least Universal property), smothers everything in cgi, throws in one lame plot device after another to extricate itself from the holes it digs for itself etc etc etc. and yet... for someone 13 and under it is the kind of movie to be seen over and over again. Kind o like the originals (it's hard to defend the integrity of films such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman after all). Not one dull moment, some wonderful characterisations of old classics (I particularly enjoyed that of Dracula), a great soundtrack and some loving attentions of detail that stand out amidst the sloppy and lazy areas such as when a piece of paper obtained centuries earlier still has the exact same shape and hue as the outlying wall from which it was removed).

","I was very disappointed with this flick. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale, both of whom are capable of riveting performances, were flat and uninteresting. They let the clothes, accents, and weapons do the acting for them. Richard Roxburgh, as Dracula, could be menacing and seductive in quiet moments, but all too easily his performance turns over-the-top. Dracula's brides are shrill and much too annoying to be scary. Igor seems to have inherited the lines of Mr. Freeze from the fourth ""Batman"" movie.<br/><br/>However, there are reasons that makes this movie a rentable rather than a film to ignore. (1) The flatness of the story and performances of the above-mentioned should diminish a bit on the smaller screen. (2) David Wenham, as Van Helsing's jittery but spunky sidekick Carl, puts more personality into one line than most of the others can put into an entire performance. He's the everyman and the story's humor. (3) Shuler Hensley brings in the heart and soul of the flick as Frankenstein's Monster. He, more than anyone else, captures the humanity of a character.

It's taking them 3 years to change the best ride at Disneyland. Why don't they just leave it alone and take 3 years to make a different ride? I'll tell you why, because they put all the new rides over in California Adventure! Is that a rook or what?! But fortunately they put all the goodies into just one ride here, called Van Hesling! Like, flying bat women! They are the coolest thing from any movie ever made. And it's a really long movie, so you get your moneys worth even if you buy some bon bons. I've never bought bon bons, but I sure would like to someday. But until then, I give this movie a nine out of ten. Don't you hate it when somebody says they really like a movie but they won't commit to give it a full ten out of ten. Like, ""I'm too cool to give any movie but Citizen Kane ten out of ten because I don't want to lose the respect of all my fans who are just waiting until I write my next review so they'll be able to go to a movie again."" Yeah, so there you go."

","Picture James Bond in the 1800's and instead of fighting criminals he is fighting monsters and you will have a pretty good idea of what this version of the movie is like. They even go so far as including a Bond Babe (Kate Beckinsale) and Q the Gadget Guy (David Wenham). Most of the creature effects were obviously left 'outrageous' to fit with the 'Monster Movie' theme and I feel that the movie could have been a lot better had they done it 'more realistic'. It could have also been a very good horror movie as well as a very good action movie instead of just a decent action movie with monsters had they focused more on the story and less on the effects. Dracula's effects were very cool until the end when they became more like the other 'cartoonish' effects. Although the elements of Dracula's plot were cool, I feel the delivery of it was too corny and cheap and thus took away from the story. I knew that I wasn't going to like the creature affects from the trailers but I had hoped that the story would make up for it, unfortunately, it did not.<br/><br/>I am sure there will be sequels a plenty for this one, especially if it continues to make the money it did in the first weekend. I will probably go see those sequels as well as watch the TV Series, but since the base on which they are built didn't meet my expectations, I can't see myself enjoying them as much as I could have had the original movie been up to par.<br/><br/>Even so, I give this one a 'it in a good theatre and rent/buy it when it comes out on DVD' rating."

","Why do they even bother? Or more precisely, why does Stephen Sommers even bother? Because when you've got money and 'clout', you can release anything and get away with it. This film was an absolute waste of time and money. Over-the-top special effects and ridiculously far-fetched action sequences made for a punishing two-hour experience. There was no style or originality to any of the action, and computer-generated images took the place of human performances. With regards to the performances, they were as wooden as the stakes repeatedly used and referred to throughout this film, not helped at all by the awfully clichÃ©d script that somehow made its way to the final draft. Then again, the writer, director and producer are the same person, so there's the answer. This isn't even a self-indulgent movie on Sommers' part. It hasn't got enough depth for it to be. Then again, perhaps that says all we need to know about Sommers, and both a person and a filmmaker? Van Helsing feels like it belongs in the 90's, as an experiment in different ways to use special effects. The only difference is that it's 2004, and we've seen it all before. Not only that, but we've seen the special effects used better and action sequences choreographed a lot classier. This is the type of film that is so bad it doesn't even deserve a review, but the people need one so that they know not to see it!"

","Let's start with the good. Kate Beckinsale looks and sounds great. OK the accent is pretty corny, but we are in Universal horror territory here. The Dracula Brides are also beautiful and well used, but then it would be difficult to screw up these characters. Shame Josie Maran has less screen time than her counterparts, but she makes the most of her appearances. There is a nice return to traditional werewolf folklore in the transformation sequences, not quite ""Company of Wolves"" but you get the idea. Similarly, the Frankenstein's Monster is well portrayed, harking back to his literary character. The film's period detail and costumes are well thought out. But there were few things which annoyed me a little. Stephen Sommers does love his CGI. We're not quite into ""The Mummy Returns"" migraine inducing levels, but certainly getting there. Wolfmen just don't look great as cartoons. I also appreciate that it must be difficult to think up an original concept for Dracula, and Richard Roxburgh's gypsy king is brave stab at this, but sadly it just doesn't work. He just looks wrong. Hugh Jackman's Gabriel Van Helsing is an interesting character, but it would have been nice to hear more of his backstory (perhaps a mention of Abraham?). Having Jackman play another character suffering from historical amnesia is just lazy. But the story moves along at a brisk pace and is very atmospheric. If you loved Sommers' Mummy movies, I'm sure you'll enjoy this, but I think vampire purists should perhaps stay away. You'll only get upset! Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a fun, if unsubstantial, ride."

","What a sorry stinker created by such a talented writer/director. To say that this movie would be worth seeing for 13 year olds, would be an insult to the entire ""tween"" generation. While boasting a talented & capable array of actors this movie disabled them with an onslaught of CGI special effects. At one point I thought why do they need actors here anyway, why not CGI the entire thing? The whole budget could have been reduced by half if they slashed the special effects segments and just let the actors do their jobs. Providing of course the was a better plot, script and dialogue! It was painful sitting through the movie and watching it's eventual decent into the ""death spiral"", only to go up in smoke in the end. The ending was the ""final stake thru the heart""! Didn't anyone tell the truth in the screening room? Apparently not! No amount of video games, action figures and fast food tie-ins can redeem the money lost in this production. I can only imagine that the initial script had an ending in the making. Because any actor who read this script and gave it the green light should have his head examined or get a better agent to make his decisions. What kind of signing bonus could they have possibly given? Even taken in the action/adventure/horror genre this movie was a so over the top it went back to lacking. If you're going to beat a dead horse, then you need to beat it very well. It need the right balance between tongue in cheek and drama. He had found it in the Mummy but couldn't seem to nail it here. It goes without saying that an audience can be very forgiving within this genre. So how could this have been such a spectacular disappointment?

","I mean we had Brad Pitt in the Trojan War, we had the Mummy Man pitching the genius concept of a Hammer ""Versus"" revival, we had Ridley Scott going all epic on us again(!!!), and this is of course excepting the showstopper and king, Spider-man making a victory lap. Well Troy I can tell you is great but Van Helsing sucks. How will Scott do?<br/><br/>Tell me honestly that you weren't drooling when he pitched the idea? Come on, Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man versus a gizmo-ed cross-wielding revision of the first (and coolest sounding) Vampire Hunter? And writer-director Sommers sounded like the man for the job didn't he? In our post-Mummy glow we assumed he knew what to do with it. Alas however it's an affront to logic but Sommers took exactly the same approach with Van Helsing as he did with Mummy 2. But Mummy 2 was pretty good wasn't it, so whats wrong this time? Dear me, where to start?<br/><br/>Firstly, check the cast list Sommers, Brendan Fraser isn't in this one. Without his irresistible goofy wit the one-liners are going to flatten right out. Without his reliable gung-ho approach to everything complimenting that wit, love for the hero is also sliced in half. Without Oded Fehr to back him up there's no co-adventurer we'll swear allegiance to. Without the adorable and hot-as-hell Rachel Wiesz there's no heroin we feel aloud to love from afar. And we can't forget Johnathan and Beni, without them what do we have to chuckle at? What did Van Helsing need?<br/><br/>Well the second I saw that early concept art of Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man I thought Sommers DID know what to do. He was goth-ing it up, I was prepared to sacrifice the humour because I knew it just couldn't sit. I thought Van Helsing would be a convergence of Myths(capital 'M' intended). You can't Nintendo it all up and make these beasties as commonplace as vermin. They should have delved into the Myst-rigue inherent and used the sheer value of these legendary characters to come up with a story that we wanted to watch. They could have chopped that $180mil in half, and put a few hundred grand into a power play that actually interested us on a cerebral level. So lastly, what does the movie have?<br/><br/>I cant believe he actually dared to use the same junk that not only every other adventure movie used but that his own leading man lived off. Come on, forgotten pasts, dark secrets, soulful quests thats not only Wolverine its the Mummy movies and its wanderer mentality which comes into nearly everything. We've had way too much of that already, he should have given it a miss. Sexy as Beckinsale is she cant be both the quest and the love interest and fellow-adventurer and the victim etc, thats just absurdly uninteresting. And Dracula, oh boy. As big a fan as I am of Ozzie actors penetrating Hollywood I'm afraid my countryman was miscast. Dracula HAS to be very tall and very menacing. We should feel as we did in 1898 when John Harker first encoundered this forgotten King who transcended centuries and fought historical battles (Vlad the Impaler). We should feel like a child that needs permission to leave their bedroom before him. Oldman was a stupid choice in 1990 for the ""faithful"" adaptation and so was Roxburgh. Short of suggesting who he should have cast I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>And he cribbed from Godzilla!! I mean for goodness sake, there are some movies that should be completely off-limits for theft, out of pure common decency and what of all the $180mil flops of last 10 decades would top the list? Sommers tried to elevate the events of the movie to transcend Transylvania. He should have instead dwelled on the character that the entire ""franchise"" depended on.<br/><br/>Listen this could go on for pages but it doesn't need to. Here's hoping that the movie makes enough to warrant a sequel in which they might (but likely cant) improve things. Otherwise, and likely, Jackman is still looking for that much touted Indiana Jones to succeed his Han Solo (Wolverine), but my greatest fear is that this will be the finishing attempt at resurrecting the Vampire King. Please, please no."

The Frankenstein is the key for the Count's children to have eternal life only all doesn't go to plan.<br/><br/>He is hunted down by villagers who resent and despise evil and the undead so therefore the Frankenstein is inevitably pursued by these and the ending for him in the beginning is not nice.<br/><br/>Anyhow, a year later, a certain Van Helsing; know for being a murderer and wanted is of Holy origin whom has had his memory washed away for reasons and has been training by monks, friars and any followers of the Vatican.<br/><br/>Then he is assigned to help the family who have been fighting Dracula for more than 400 years, the last descendant of this holy family is Anna; strong willed women to carry out her laid out duties. Soon, they find out a secret the count has that links Van Helsing and Anna together... you can find that out watching the movie. All in all you will not be disappointed by the action, dramatical depth to the storyline, the CGI effects, scenes that will make you jump like me, the comedy has reference to ""A La James Bond Style"", especially with the Igor who quaintly played Benny in ""The Mummy"" which if you loved then this film is the one for you."

","Watching The Mummy again after sitting through Van Helsing really makes you wonder exactly what Stephen Sommers is thinking these days... How on earth could someone responsible for an imaginative, witty script and sympathetic characters 5 years ago have descended to the level of Van Helsing today?<br/><br/>The answer, I'd imagine, is that he's had obscene amounts of money thrown at him to make Van Helsing, so the dire end result shouldn't really be surprising.  What is surprising is that the huge budget couldn't stretch to making the CGI even as good as the 1999 original... that's worrying, more than anything, considering that most of the film is computer generated.<br/><br/>What we're left with is Hugh Jackman suffering a sudden charisma bypass (didn't see that one coming!) the moment he got those stupid hair extensions. Kate Beckinsdale, meanwhile, had a chance to prove that Underworld was no one-off - she has now lost any acting ability she once had, and I spent most of the film wondering how she could breathe in that ridiculous corset. Does she even read the scripts herself these days? Amazing how a cursed Rumanian gypsy princess manages to be a less exciting character than Rachel Weisz's daffy librarian, but the difference is that Evie had brains and a cute grudge against the Benbridge Scholars.  Anna has a creaky 'concept', an extremely dodgy accent, a rather unconvincing way with a sword and by all rights should get killed off within 5 minutes of her character being introduced.  Shame.<br/><br/>The script is banal at best - David Wenham's lapsed friar, Carl, gets all the best lines, and very slim pickings they are.  The days of Sommer's wisecracking hero seem awfully long ago, as Jackman just sleepwalks his way through the unfunny moments he does have.  Added to the zero chemistry between him and Kate Beckinsdale and I was wanting to either fall asleep or walk out (it was a late showing!) every time either of them was onscreen. That would be nearly every scene, then...<br/><br/>The plot doesn't even bear thinking about - it certainly owed nothing to logic, reason or good storytelling.  Aside from the camp black and white prologue - which raises a faint smile - and a sumptuously produced ballroom scene (choreographed a la Cirque du Soleil), there a no 'wow' moments. Not at all.  The film has been CGI'd to death at heart - which was sadly the way The Mummy Returns was headed, but at least that inherited decent characters to buoy it up.<br/><br/>It's hard to convey exactly how mind-numbingly awful Van Helsing is. Unfunny, tedious and essentially heartless, not even the added pathos of Frankenstein's monster can redeem it.  It would seem Sommers has followed the Wachowskis and George Lucas down the road of forgetting how to write, direct or cast convincingly the moment they hit the big time."

"mrausch","Null","0","0","15 May 2004"," Fun action, but lacking in any true sense of horror
","Pop culture likes to emphasize that `this is not your father's (insert radio/TV/personal pastime here).'  Well, such is the case with Van Helsing, the new horror/action thriller, starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Based on the character who so valiantly fights Count Dracula in Bram Stoker's original novel, and who has been reincarnated on the screen by everyone from Edward Van Sloan (1931) to Peter Cushing (1958) to Sir Laurence Olivier (1979) to Sir Anthony Hopkins (1992), Jackman is hardly the Victorian Era drawing room intellectual who battles evil using crosses, wooden stakes and cloves of garlic so frequently resurrected for the screen. And that is to both the film's good and detriment. Jackman's Van Helsing, a black leather-clad, fedora-sporting adventurer, is employed by the Vatican to battle the world's monsters and evils.  Like some 19th century James Bond, he carries an arsenal of advanced weaponry (i.e., a crossbow that shoots a rapid-fire succession of arrows), all devised by his own `Q', a bookish friar named Carl who also serves as his sidekick. When first we meet Van Helsing, he is confronting the belligerent and murderous Mr. Edward Hyde, a bellicose, cigar-smoking giant, who has completely taken over the body of the kindly Dr. Henry Jekyll.  The two battle inside a French cathedral (it's not clear if it is Notre Dame), with the end result being Hyde/Jekyll killed, and a centuries old stained glass window shattered.  Such results are typical of this Van Helsing's battles, which has him in disfavor with his superiors in Vatican City, despite his success at curbing the world's monster population. Following his exploits in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania, where it is learned Count Dracula is close to exterminating the Valeriouses, a wealthy family with close ties to the Vatican.  There, Van Helsing uncovers a plot by the Count and his fiendish brides to unleash thousands of vampires upon the world, brought to life through the electrical charge Dr. Frankenstein found in lightning and used to create his monster (the Count, in fact, needs the Monster to carry out his plan).  Standing in the Count's way, alongside Van Helsing, is the beautiful and resourceful Anna Valerious (Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan, who has been cursed as a werewolf. You see, in the story as devised by writer-director Stephen Sommers, a werewolf can kill a vampire, although they typically don't because they are usually under the vampire's power. This is the first time that Van Helsing, a character privy until now only<br/><br/>to Dracula, has become involved with the big three, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolfman.  He has a new first name; Gabriel, not Abraham. And, as personified by Jackman, he is far sexier than Van Sloan's myopic crusader, or Olivier's Dutch accent challenged vampire slayer.  Truth be told, Jackman's Van Helsing is far more warrior than professor, acrobatically waging war against the Count and his minions, while leaving to others the deciphering of any riddles connected to Dracula's scheme.  This Van Helsing is a man of action, not the mind, a major departure from the character as envisioned by Stoker. To give him a new look and history seems so apropos in this day and age of `extreme makeover', but, so much is accomplished through f/x and CG, there is a human element that is lost.  Sommers makes a vain attempt to humanize Van Helsing with a back story that makes his mission to destroy Dracula a personal one, but mostly, in Sommers vision, Van Helsing loses his connection to the audience, and instead becomes just another super-hero swallowed up by stunts.  Van Helsing is a fun thrill ride that carries a touch of nostalgia (specifically, a superb black and white salute to the Universal horror film of the 1930s), but which never reaches in to illuminate the soul of the character or cast a true shadow of horror on the audience."

","Oh my god - where do I begin pulling this turkey to pieces?<br/><br/>Ok, let's start by mourning the loss of Hugh Jackman's %100 record for making good films. Although his acting is of its usual high standard in this 3-legged donkey of a movie, the script was appaling and I'm still trying to work out what accent he was going for. However, I won't start attacking accents just yet... I'm saving that for Kate Beckinsale's Transylvannian, Irish, Christopher Lambert, Twin Peaks attempt that was about as convincing as England's entry in last year's Eurovision Song Contest (don't worry Americans - you're not missing out on anything, trust me). Kate - Nil point (say this with a French accent)!<br/><br/>Before seeing this film I had been praying and praying that Hugh Jackman would be cast as Superman in the upcoming remake that is, might, could, perhaps, was, will be, being made. However, I think that after being subjected to Van Schmelsching ruining what would otherwise have been a fine bucket of sweet popcorn, Danny DeVito would make a more convincing Super Kent.<br/><br/>In short - the script is utterly terrible (Kate Beckinsale - ""nothing is faster than Transylvannian horses""... except for the Wolfman, Dracula and all 3 of his brides), The plot is lacking in consistency at best (Why are Dracula's offspring laid as dinosaur eggs..? Why was Frankenstein encased in a block of ice..?) and the CGI was completely pants (no specific examples are necessary).<br/><br/>Another problem that Hollywood seems to have with films set in ""Ye Olden Times"" is the pathetic ways they manage to get explosions into films that could only ever fit into Independence Day, ie The Wolfman jumps on top of a horse drawn carriage and the roof cathes fire which moments later leads to an explosion that could only have been caused by the computer-detenated C4 lift-shaft scene in Die Hard. Now, I may not be Steven Hawking but I'm pretty sure there's no scientific explanation for that.<br/><br/>The films only saving grace is Kate Beckinsale's scantily clad frame but this is constantly ignored when she speaks in her native Transylvannian, Irish, Christopher Lambert, Twin Peaks tongue.<br/><br/>Give this one a miss folks!"

So, we have a script suitable for a good parody, a nice comic relief guy(Wenham) and an excellent portrait of a self-sarcastic Dracula by -clever- Roxburgh. The rest of the cast/crew/film, though, seems to fail to understand how and what. So, they act seriously while dealing with extremely hilarious facts and situations and they end up looking stupid and ridiculous. Obviously Mr Sommers spent large amounts of money on visual fx and other technical things.Perhaps he should spend a little more time in guiding his cast, leading them through the same way into a ""pure-blood"" movie.

Sure, both Noble and Roxburgh managed their way, but it's a pity they were put on the losing position from the start. This could have been the best Dracula ever. I'd love to see Roxburgh play Vetinari (the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork from Discworld series), but only under a better director.<br/><br/>It would also pay to choose better actresses for the brides. The rest of cast were good, but the ""Transilvanian"" accents made ME cringe, and I'm not even a native speaker.<br/><br/>The stereotyping was awful, I'm damn happy I'm not a Romanian, I'd either laugh all the way through gritted teeth or fly from the theatre screaming.<br/><br/>Anyway, the music was good, the landscapes fantastic and the sets and camera work did manage to create some atmosphere.<br/><br/>I'm not sorry I saw this film, but I wish I had left ALL my braincells at home.<br/><br/>One thing helped me to go through this movie pretty painlessly, even through those moments when Dracula was not on screen - there was always something nice to look at: the leading male characters were handsome guys, the women at least had interesting clothes, the mountains were beautiful etc."

Hollywood has done a lot of damage to the Monster, and now it's time for a more accurate portrayal of Mary Shelley's creation. Hugh Jackman does a good job NOT playing Wolverine, and Kate Beckinsale does Romanian with the best of them.

","I want my money back!<br/><br/>This movie was below feeble. From the opening scene, where the lead villain was introduced, I was disappointed. Had this movie been a documentary of the life and times of Liberace, then the casting would have been inspired. Who was this man and why was he pretending to be a badass vampire? This is, quite simply, the WORST piece of casting I had ever seen. We can forgive the fact that Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman was present - this was a Hollywood farce, after all, but I was totally unmoved by the limp presence and performance of this actor. And don't get me started on the plot and plot devices. This movie actively 'ripped off' other, superior, movies. There is the whole James Bond, Q, scene. There is the Lord of The Rings, bridge scene. The Matrix is touched on. Unbelievably, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is robbed of its Mr Hyde. And, believe it or not, there are ACTUALLY Umpa Loompas in this film! The plot is so bad that it is predictable from the first 5 minutes! Admittedly, there were some good action scenes in this movie but I was distracted from enjoying them from laughing at the rest of the awfulness. Do not waste your money.

While the graphics and action sequences were entertaining, the acting seemed over the top and a little too comical to do anything but hurt the movie. Dracula was unsexy, his brides were just 90210 bitches with wings, and the whole vampire offspring twist seemed a little like it was the idea of a desperate Red Bull drinking writer. I thought most of it could have been done much better without changing it too much. And the rest would have sucked no matter what. Dracula met Van Helsing at a completely different era than the one in which Dr. Frankenstein was making his monster. And the Roman war ""Gabriel"" made reference to which was sited in the movie as being 73 b.c. was actually about 200 a.d.

","I saw the movie and ... where to begin ...<br/><br/>In my honest opinion it was a TOTAL CRAP! I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BIGGER CRAP IN MY LIFE! Maybe Dogma was also crap movie, but not like this one, this goes NR.1 in my charts (by the way the Web Site is also crap, too commercial and very slow too). It was not the mixing of all those fantastic creatures that bothered me but the mistakes, insults and insinuations addressed to my mother country ROMANIA really pissed me off. Let's see ... We will take it point by point. 1. I consider it common sense (shameful) that when making a movie with a budget of billions of US dollars you do not know or don't pay somebody to look at the map to see that the capital of ROMANIA is BUCHAREST not Budapest (which is the capital of Hungary) as it was presented in the movie! For the Director and the Producer of the movie especially, I want to inform them that ROMANIA and Hungary are different (neighbor) countries. And by the way we Romanians are around for 2000 years we but we never had a gypsy as a king neither such a capital. Gypsy Kings are a latino band, my dears! If you didn't know that you should have asked, or maybe take some Romanian in the movie crew. Or next time just ask me I will offer my advice for free. 2. In the beginning of the movie it was said that the action takes place in Romania (Tansilvania is province of Romania) 'a cursed land inhabited by cursed people'. This doesn't sound very good to me. It is pretty much an insult to country itself and to the 23 million inhabitants of Romania. We may be cursed (it is normal when the medium salary is 100 US dollars/month) but the county I can assure you is one of the most beautiful and rich (in natural resources) in Europe and is not at all cursed as it was presented. And off the record the images presented there were more suited to describe Romania in the 16th century not 18th. What will people think now about us, after seeing this movie? 3. I don't know about the others but I am proud of being Romanian and I think we are a nation as normal as many on this earth, and this movie is not quite a good presentation for Romania. Anyway I just wrote that just to defend a little our image and to let people know that we have evaluated a lot since the times presented there in the movie, we even got Internet now (80% of the youth use Internet and has a computer). :p I hope that our government will sue the producers of this movie!"

The 150-200 million dollar film wastes most of that money on cheesy and unneeded special effects. When the vampires open their mouths they look more like cartoon opposums, and Dracula himself looks like an evil 1980s (U2's) Bono, complete with visible hair clip (don't worry his acting is worse). Not only that, the production company couldn't fit an even halfway mediocre screenwriter into its aircraft carrier size budget as the entire script probably took up one typed page, if you think I'm joking go see the movie.

"Pavel-8","6","0","0","13 May 2004"," The summer movie onslaught has begun.
","""Van Helsing"" tells the story of the titular character (Hugh Jackman), who serves the Vatican as a sort of black ops agent whose missions are to eradicate various unrepentant monsters. His primary task here is to destroy the horrific triumvirate of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster. With his own medieval Agent Q (LOTR's David Wenham), our hero ventures to Transylvania to team up with the stunning Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last survivor in a noble family that must kill Dracula or be condemned forever to purgatory.<br/><br/>Although I think the makers of ""Van Helsing"" tried to inject a dose of heart their work, they still produced little more than a good summer popcorn movie, and I don't mean that as an insult. Director Stephen Sommers also helmed ""The Mummy"" and its sequels, and while I would rate Van Helsing ahead of those movies, it is cast from the same mold. If you go in with expectations of greatness, you'll no doubt hate it and be utterly disappointed. But if you settle in looking for nothing more than 2+ hours of fun, nearly campy entertainment, you'll be thoroughly satisfied.<br/><br/>
A large reason that it falls short of being even a good movie is the derivative nature of the entire flick. Although set in a dark neo-Victorian age (in which it always seems to be raining), ""Van Helsing"" contains countless scenes that bring to mind various classics. Whether it be Van Helsing's Batman-esque tools, his gadget room borrowed from James Bond, shots taken from Looney Tunes, or a scene straight out of ""Get Smart"" (yes, that's right), so much of the movie has been done before. More than any other, Van Helsing imitates The Indiana Jones Trilogy in ways ranging from the hero's attire to how certain characters die to the use of a map to display travel. Even Alan Silvestri's music recalls one of Indy's secondary themes. While this derivative nature prevents ""Van Helsing"" from being a truly good film, it does provide a alternative unique form of entertainment. Half the fun of the movie is pinpointing the pervasive cinematic references.<br/><br/>
The other half of the fun comes from the overall appearance and content. While these well-known characters have been portrayed on the screen hundreds of times through the years, rarely are they seen so vividly in an action movie such as this. Jackman possesses a perfect look for the swashbuckling protagonist; Roxburgh not only twirls his mustache well, but does add some humanity to the blood-sucking count. Beckinsale, in a role not all that different from her turn in Underworld, isn't asked to do much but look vengeful and beautiful, and does just that, managing to fight ferociously in tight clothes while still maintaining her gorgeous and pristine appearance. Wenham, in stark contrast to his noble Faramir, fills the thankless comic relief role, and does so rather well, considering what he is given to work with.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast consists primarily of minor roles or special effects. Unfortunately while the physical appearance of the movie is excellent, the visual effects aren't always up to par. They're not bad, but also aren't quite seamless with the rest of the flick. Every once in a while something doesn't quite match or feels just a little too fake. With so many effects done by many different effects houses, perhaps this was inevitable, but the minor discrepancies are still occasionally distracting, which is the one thing that visual effects should not be.<br/><br/>The effects are not helped by the fact that the movie, at nearly two and a half hours, is twenty minutes too long. As enjoyable as the various people and fights are, one can only take so much of horror characters scurrying around doing battle. Trimming a few minutes out of about every scene would have made the remaining excitement that much more enjoyable, resulting in a more streamlined and bearable picture. As it is, everything drags on too long, permitting what could have been a taut adventure film to unravel into a messier and less cohesive movie.<br/><br/>As the movie that kick-starts the summer season, ""Van Helsing"" receives some leeway. Had it been released in August, it probably wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable, following a summer of similarly action-packed but largely forgettable fare. But with cinematic tastebuds longing for fresh popcorn after a stale spring, Van Helsing survives its shortcomings to provide a satisfying if short-lived treat.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Decent summertainment, at least as the first biggie of the season.  6/10, for fun as much as quality."

","I'd read quite a few reviews on different sites where people were complaining about the lack of substance and how the movie didn't take itself seriously and so on and so on. And, well. I really don't know what in the world those people were expecting from a movie with vampires, werewolves, *and* Frankenstein's monster directed by the guy who made The Mummy. Van Helsing was everything I expected it to be: big stupid monster fun. For crying out loud, it had villagers with pitchforks and torches in the beginning! How can anyone expect a film that starts off that way to be high art?<br/><br/>Speaking of the beginning, I was absolutely delighted with it. Some people might call it a rip-off but I thought it was a brilliant homage to Frankenstein (it's been a while since I've seen it, but I'm pretty sure up until Dracula pops up, it was shot-for-shot the same).<br/><br/>Also, Dracula! Quite a few people have expressed the opinion that Richard Roxburgh wasn't portraying him seriously enough, but, again, why would he? As soon as he began to speak, I was all, 'ha!  Bela Lugosi!' and, oh, I loved the way he camped the entire thing up. Along the same lines, I also loved his brides. The scene of them all overemoting and wailing after the vamplings all exploded? So cheesy! It was fantastic.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were okay, although I spent most of the movie wondering when Kate was going to say, 'Ve must get moose and squirrel!'<br/><br/>The best part of the movie, though, and the main reason I wanted to see it, was David Wenham. Absolutely darling and funny! And it was kind of weird because I've only ever seen him as Faramir, aka The Saddest Man in All of Gondor, but I loved it. Maybe I'm just easily amused, but I had a giggle-fit almost every time he appeared on-screen.  I don't understand why Carl had to be so short, though. Well, okay, maybe I do a little, to make Van Helsing all the more larger-than-life and all that crap, but, still. My back hurt watching him slump around. awww, poor Daisy.<br/><br/>I do have to agree with everyone who said the CGI sucked. The brides weren't too bad but, god. Jekyll? bleh. Didn't like that at all. And the werewolves all looked...well. Fake. Come on, folks. If you're going to CG, at least make an effort.<br/><br/>So, yeah. overall, I loved it. I went in expecting non-stop action and lots of pretty, and that's pretty much what I got, plus some laughs (some maybe unintentional, like 'The roof, the roof, the roof is on fi-yah').<br/><br/>And I am all about a sequel.

","I actually liked Van Helsing. It's a wild rollercoaster ride. And as an attempt to make something more akin to League of Extraordinary Gentlemen than Stephen Norrington's abysmally bad movie version of Alan Moore's work of genius, it worked.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it didn't have Alan Moore, who could have made the dialogue work too and the character motivations more interesting. But who cares - the action was what it was about, there was plenty of it, and I for one at times even sat in the cinema wishing for a RWD button to take another look at what actually happened here or there.<br/><br/>A final aside: Now that Alan Moore has opened the can of worms that is public domain reworking of classic characters, we will see plenty of bad instances of it in the future. It's the way of the world (or Hollywood at least), and Alan Moore will regrettably never see one cent of the bazillions of dollars generated from his idea.

It seems as if the critics were expecting some deeply intellectual and thought -provoking masterpiece when it never tries or claims to be.  It is simply a fun, entertaining action/adventure remake of the old classic horror films of the 50's and I think that in that capacity it succeeds very well.  The critics also complained of what they called a ""pixel overload"" but, I thought the special effects were extremely well done and anything less might have made it as cheesy as the old horror films that it is paying tribute too.  True, the acting isn't oscar-worthy, but I don't think that was the goal of the film.  And, even if the acting wasn't superb, I still enjoyed all the portrayals of the characters immensely, even Roxburgh's (Dracula) cheesy transylvanian accent, but honestly who can do a transylvanian accent that doesn't sound cheesy?

She makes one of the best entrances I've ever seen, and eventually the pandering, topless-looking blouse she runs around in seems less crude and more like the cherries that top this banquet of fattening dessert.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Sommers, Van Helsing also recalls his blockbuster Mummy movies (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns).  Both of those films were great --and here's the proof.  All of these features are about style over substance; about being fun rather than thought-provoking.  But where Van Helsing is willing to lessen the depth of its script to the point where its entertainment value is barely skin deep --just so it can accommodate for more villains, The Mummy films were centered around only one villain, forcing them to write a script with deeper characters and better lines."
"dracwlya","Null","0","0","17 May 2004"," Not a bad movie, but a poor movie.
","After Stephen Sommers' ""Mummy"" movies (including ""The Scorpion King"", I had high hopes for this movie.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to them. For one thing, Sommers put too much into this one - Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolves and Dracula - so the plot was convoluted and wandered all over the place.  The ""solution"" to the problem defied the strongest sense of disbelief, and a lot of the rest of the plot was too bizarre as well.  I'm being deliberately vague on this since I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.  I was also angered to see Kate Beckinsale's character, who is supposed to be a pretty mighty monster hunter in her own right, get pushed into a distant second role even after we see the kinds of things she can do - it reminded me a lot of what was done with Maid Marion's character in the Kevin Costner ""Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves"" movie where Marion very nearly kills Robin the first time they meet in the movie, but is completely incapable of taking the smallest part in her own rescue at the end (I distinctly remember someone in the audience screaming, ""What the h--l is this?  Two hours ago she was a f-----g ninja!"").  It's too bad that Sommers forsook the ensemble cast approach that worked so well in all of the ""Mummy"" movies.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie sported the number of great performances you would expect considering the actors.  Those of us who are only familiar with David Wenham from his portrayal of Faramir in ""The Lord Of The Rings"" get to see a wonderful comic side to his abilities.  Richard Roxburgh again shows his ability as a villain; my only regret here is that that's the only thing we usually get to see him doing in the States.  Another regret is that Robbie Coltrane and Samuel West, playing Mr. Hyde and Dr. Frankenstein respectively, get so little screen time.  Kate Beckinsale again demonstrates a flair for heroic action and turns in an excellent performance, but gets pushed to the sidelines by Hugh Jackman.  Jackman's performance was passable, but in spite of getting the title role, he got little material with which to work; I think Sommers must have told him to go out there and pretend to be the monster-hunting version of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name (albeit a version who, despite being an immortal, monster-hunter, the supposed ""Left Hand of God,"" cannot hit the broad side of the barn with anything but a shotgun, and then only if it doesn't really matter. Go figure), and that was pretty much it.  <br/><br/>However, since I paid matinee price for it, it was at least a diverting afternoon, if not a really entertaining one.  If I had paid full price, I would have felt utterly cheated."

","If you like science fiction with a mixture of love story and some comical details, this is your film. The argument is quite simple, but there are some little details that make the film more interesting, such as the death of one of its main characters or the litters of bloodthirsty 'mini-Draculas'. The best of the film: Elena Anaya´s performance as one of Dracula´s girlfriends; the worst: a slightly different Dracula (nothing to do with Bram Stocker´s version) and too much makeup on Kate Beckinsale´s face. Hugh Jackman does it best in his role of a bad and affectionate guy, as he has already proved in other films such as X-Men.

Riding on the crest of its own wave of undeserved hype, Van Helsing blew into town with a big reputation, but rarely before has a would-be blockbuster promised so much and delivered.....well, little more than self loathing, self-pity and thoughts of ""I could have spent this money on a hooker.""<br/><br/>
It was badly written.<br/><br/>Badly scripted.<br/><br/>Badly acted.<br/><br/>Badly cast (Come on, Dracula should be a gentleman, perfectly groomed with impeccable manners - balanced of course with an unnerving charm and devastating attack - but sadly we got nothing of the sort)<br/><br/>Badly edited (Never before have I thought, or even noticed, that a film was poorly edited)<br/><br/>Badly scored.<br/><br/>Van Helsing was very unlike Van Helsing - for a start, the guy did not have amnesia.  The gadgetry was a trifle ridiculous, although in fairness one must remember to suspend reality to a fair old extent for such a film - but still, it seemed out of place - although I found myself wishing I had possession of that crossbow gun, and an appointment with director Stephen Sommers.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale, always easy on the eye, was unusually wooden in her portrayal of Anna, and Jackman lacked everything he brought to the screen in terms of coolness as Wolverine in the X-Men films.<br/><br/>Heed not the foolish mortals who boast of the film's awesome CGI effects - they were out of place and only served to further cement the poor visuals of the movie.<br/><br/>In Van Helsing, there is potential for an absolute cracker of a movie. They could have made it dark, almost sexy even, and given it a great soundtrack. Instead they made it corny and totally cliched, and the supposed comic relief of Igor made little impact. And the soundtrack? Just plain wrong - it only fits the movie in terms of being inappropriate.<br/><br/>

","Although I have heard many remarks about the lack of quality of the film I have to say that I disagree with almost all of them! I saw this movie and the 2 or so hours flew past due to the captivating action, special effects, and way that Sommers presented his monsters. The black and white prologue clearly showed Sommers's love for the old horror movies, and the story line, although not as unique as the Underworld plot, was interesting. The acting by Hugh Jackman was very good, and, although Kate Beckinsale's accent was questionable, the chemistry between the two characters was unmistakable. If you want to see a straightforward, unimaginative, realistic movie there's no point in going but that was obvious from the start since it's a movie with vampires, werewolves, frankenstein's monster, and even Dr Jekyll and  Mr Hyde. However, if you wish to see an enjoyable escapist movie I highly recommend it!"

","Okay, here's the deal - I am not a big fan of action movies. But I liked The Mummy. A lot. It was very good fun. Suspension of disbelief? No problem, can do. But Van Helsing? Lame. No heart. Stupid script. Waste of acting talent. Would have been a waste of money, too, but I went to see it at a cheap matinee and I can at least say I have seen it, now. So I'm entitled to my opinion, right? Wasn't there a line in it about Frankenstein's monster being made of seven men stuck together? Well, this was at least seventy movies stuck very badly and at odd angles together. Van Helsing gets my vote for most stupid movie of 2004, so far. Been there, done that, hope I won't have to see it ever again.<br/><br/>One positive thing: David Wenham.

Neither do we get to know the female lead. I understood she was from a long line of vampire hunters if I am not mistaken. Frankenstein looked pretty good but did he have Shakespeare's. He was more dramatic than anyone in that Titanic movie. Now from what I understand wasn't the wolfman only 1 person. He was about three in this movie. And the kicker is the ending.......

","This movie is souless.  Its not bad and its not good.  In fact, its so boring it's barely watchable.  The writing is absolutely atrocious.  It's as if they piece the script together from other films.  It absolutely brings nothing original to the screen.  You seen everything here before done much much better.  The actors seem as if they are mailing in their performances. And that crap with the Friar and tying him into Q from James Bond almost made me want to leave the theater.  I've seen Van Helsing played better by older men with less effect and no modern weapons.  Obvious the blame is squarely on Sommers.  All he did was took his shell from The Mummy and inserted different characters.  He had no idea what to do with his leading lady and his leading man, as the same with the Mummy, is just trying to be a weaker version of Indiana Jones.  You will recognize all sorts of films in this movie: Mask of Zorro, The Mummy, Underworld (with all the blue in the movie), James Bond, Indiana Jones.  It's just a formula film whose formula needs to be retired.  There is absolutely no passion in this film.  No risk taking, nothing that WOWS you.  You would only see this movie once you exhaust all other ideals on what to do with your evening.  And guess what, you can tell it's lifeless from the previews.  And the funny part of it all, is that you pull for this film to be better while you are watching it. You want them to go that extra steps, but apparently the director just doesn't have the confidence to do so and in the end the audience gets cheated."

","I took my kids (17 & 13) to see this on Friday.  While we all had fun, on the ride back, pointing out parts of the movie that were not done well, in the end we all enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsdale were solid, if unspectacular, in the leads.  The Friar was very good as comedy relief, Dracula's brides were alternately luscious and vicious, Frankenstein's monster was very well done, even with the steampunk edge to him.  This was more the monster from the book than from the old Universal films, but, for me, it worked.<br/><br/>Dracula was a bit insipid and the CGI'd Mr. Hyde was almost cartoonish.  As another reviewer pointed out, there were no scary moments, but this was, to me, much more of a CGI action picture, with a horror motif, than a horror movie.  (Might as well complain about the lack of science in Star Wars, but then I have done that myself.)<br/><br/>In the end, we had a good time, the movie wasn't great, but it was a fun kickoff to the summer."

","I had high expectations for this film, or at least I did until I read all the bad reviews. Yet I did go see the film today, and it definitely is a film that lingers in one's mind-or in my mind at least.<br/><br/>The film has some great sets and the make-up seemed to be pretty good (although probably not as masterful as Jack Pierce's classic creations). The plot isn't the best, but it's not too bad either. The acting was done fairly well, and Roxburgh makes a good impression as a semi-original Dracula. Shuler Hensley does the Frankenstein Monster justice, but does seem to be a bit under-used. The werewolves are ferocious, and the transformation sequences seem to be the best in horror films thus far.<br/><br/>There are inconsistencies, or things that do not make sense in the film. Or at least they are not given any rational explanation.<br/><br/>Now the nitpicky stuff. Kevin J. O' Connor was great as ""Igor"" who seemed very reminiscent of Bela Lugosi's ""Ygor"" (From ""Son Of Frankenstein"" and ""Ghost Of Frankenstein""). Once more this film rewrites the end to ""Frankenstein"" just like ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" had rewritten it to better suit its story. On even more technical grounds, they even mess up the real life Dracula's years of birth and supposed death (in the film it is 1422-1462, in history it was 1431-1476). They also minorly changed the words to Curt Siodmak's classic Wolf Man poem, but is slightly noticeable unless you've practically memorized it.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good multi-monster film, even if some characters are under-used. If you can look past some funny cliche-ish lines, constant stunt scenes, and some nitpicky details-it should be a fun film to watch and one that may captivate your imagination just like the original Universal films have captivated the imaginations of generations since 1931 (since 1925 for the famous ""Opera Ghost"" and 1923 I believe for the original French hunchback, but 1931 was the year that Lugosi and Karloff, Bela and Boris, gave us the cinematic gems that persevere in our hearts and minds...and in our fears and imagination).<br/><br/>Sincerely, Exchronos"

","i have just seen the movie today 5/11/04 and I have a fair amount to say about it. 1) The action was good and kept my attention but everything you see in VH you can see in ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"". 2) The acting wasn't that great but how many action movies can you name where there was very convincing action? 3) After all the hype and what everyone said about this movie I should say that I expected just a bit more but it wasn't horrible for a PG13 action movie.

But for me and I'm sure the rest of the male fans are concerned the best part about this movie is the fact that Kate Beckinsale wears a very sexy outfit(but then again give her a trash bag to wear and she'd make it sexy) and kicks some major ass.

"Darth_Stat","Null","0","0","11 May 2004"," ""Orlando Bloom, you should not be aloud to act. Legally."" Why cant gut-pain hilarious stuff like that make it onto a poster?
","You know, from the point of view of 2003, 2004 looked like a historical year didn't it? I mean we had Brad Pitt in the Trojan War, we had the Mummy Man pitching the genius concept of a Hammer ""Versus"" revival, we had Ridley Scott going all epic on us again(!!!), we had a Gary Oldman Harry Potter movie and we had the curious idea of a Shrek sequel (so absurdly inappropriate we could only assume they had an ace up there sleeve) but this is ofcourse excepting the showstopper and king, Spider-man making a victory lap. What happened?<br/><br/>Lets hope Ridley gets the first good performance out of Orlando and lets hope Harry Potter and Spider-man 2 are as kick-ass as the trailers make out cause early word on Troy is potent, the Shrek sequel sounds like a phony they dont wanna release at all, the Spider-man 2 trailer gives me no reason not to be excited yet they've withdrawn it from competition, and Van Helsing sucks.<br/><br/>
Tell me honestly that you weren't drooling when he pitched the idea? Come on, Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man versus a gizmo-ed cross-wielding revision of the first (and coolest sounding) Vampire Hunter? And writer-director Sommers sounded like the man for the job didn't he? In our post-Mummy glow we assumed he knew what to do with it. Alas however it's an affront to logic but Sommers took exactly the same approach with Van Helsing as he did with Mummy 2. But Mummy 2 was pretty good wasn't it, so whats wrong this time? Dear me, where to start?<br/><br/>Firstly, check the cast list Sommers, Brendan Fraser isn't in this one. Without his irresistable goofy wit the one-liners are going to flatten right out. Without his reliable gung-ho approach to everything complimenting that wit, love for the hero is also sliced in half. Without 'it-man' Oded Fehr to back him up there's no co-adventurer we'll swear alliegence to. Without the adorable and hot-as-hell Rachel Wiesz there's no heroin we empathise with and feel aloud to love from afar. And we can't forget Johnathan and Beni, without them what do we have to chuckle at? Who does the hero look all the better beside? What did Van Helsing need?<br/><br/>Well the second I saw that early concept art of Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man I thought Sommers DID know what to do. He was goth-ing it up, I was prepared to sacrifice the humour because I knew it just couldn't sit. I thought Van Helsing would be a convergence of Myths(capital 'M' intended). You can't nintendo it all up and make these beasties as commonplace as vermin. They should have delved into the Myst-rigue inherent and used the sheer value of these legendary characters to come up with a story that we wanted to watch. They could have chopped that $180mil in half, and put a few hundred grand into a powerplay that actually interested us on a cerebral level. So lastly, what does the movie have?<br/><br/>I cant believe he actually dared to use the same junk that not only every other adventure movie used but that his own leading man lived off. Come on, forgotten pasts, dark secrets, soulful quests thats not only Wolverine its the Mummy movies and its wanderer mentality which comes into nearly everything. We've had way too much of that already, he should have given it a miss. Sexy as Beckinsale is she cant be both the quest and the love interest and fellow-adventurer and the victim etc, thats just absurdly uninteresting. And Dracula, oh boy. As big a fan as I am of Ozzie actors penetrating Hollywood I'm afraid my countryman was miscast. Dracula HAS to be very tall and very menacing. We should feel as we did in 1898 when John Harker first encoundered this fogotten King who transcended centuries and fought historical battles (Vlad the Impaler). We should feel like a child that needs permission to leave their bedroom before him. Oldman was a stupid choice in 1990 for the ""faithful"" adaptation and so was Roxburgh. Short of suggesting who he should have cast I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>
And he cribbed from Godzilla!! I mean for goodness sake, there are some movies that should be completely off-limits for theft, out of pure common decency and what of all the $180mil flops of last 10 decades would top the list? Sommers tried to elevate the events of the movie to transcend Transylvania. He should have instead dwelled on the character that the entire ""franchise"" depended on.<br/><br/>Listen this could go on for pages but it doesn't need to. Here's hoping that the movie makes enough to warrant a sequel in which they might (but likely cant) improve things. Otherwise, and likely, Jackman is still looking for that much touted Indiana Jones to succeed his Han Solo (Wolverine), but my greatest fear is that this will be the finishing attempt at resurecting the Vampire King. Please, please no."

To give a movie such a bad rap is such an egotistical, self-centred approach to life.  I don't think of myself as a movie critic, I am there to enjoy myself.

The movie is one incredible failure that should never have seen the inside of a cinema.<br/><br/>The premise is cheesey, but at least has potential for some light entertainment. The concept of bringing together a collection of famous, nay infamous, horror creatures for a piece of cheesey villainy could have been carried off so much better.<br/><br/>However the complete lack of story-telling skill, the overwhelmingly tedious computer generated effects, and the absence of any sense of threat from Dracula himself render the movie simply a waste of time.<br/><br/>Events happen that have no bearing on the remainder of the film, and action sequences are dragged out for what seems like hours. Plot threads are created, and then abandoned and ignored when they no longer suit the director's requirements. The entire end sequence is one example - a clearly expressed deadline is simply forgotten with no ill effects.<br/><br/>The only redeeming features of Van Helsing are the black and white intro sequence - cheesey and corny, but at least entertainingly so - and the sight of Kate Beckinsale in a fabulously sexy outfit.<br/><br/>For all the monsters Van Helsing has slain, the one he missed most was the one that should have died at birth.

","An homage to the classic Universal monsters of the 1930s and 40s, the opening ten minutes of Van Helsing - filmed in glorious black and white, and full of torch-toting villagers - are oddly reminiscent of Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. Both films play into a set of pop-culture expectations that we have of our beloved movie monsters; both recall a time in Hollywood where any combination of them - Dracula, Frankstein's monster, and/or the Wolf Man - was a sure way to put keisters in the seats. And where Brooks turned so adeptly to comedy with his homage, writer-director Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) here resurrects his particular forte: action and adventure. Indeed, once Van Helsing switches over to color, this special-effects laden juggernaut never lets up. And its many-monstered minutes - over 200 of them (minutes, that is [though there are seemingly just as many monsters]) - are a spectacle to behold.<br/><br/>Still, spectacle wears thin with a plot this threadbare. Seems Dracula is looking to use the Frankenstein monster to give life to an army of the undead, and (partial spolier) only the secret of the curse of the werewolf can stop him. Is it fun? Sure. In the title role, an athletic Hugh Jackman (X-Men) seems to be having a blast, and his equally agile co-star, Kate Beckinsale, appears much more comfortable fighting vampires than being one (as she did in the somewhat over serious and less entertaining Underworld). Perhaps what's missing here is something Lugosi, Karloff, and even Lon Chaney Jr. brought to the screen over half a century ago that the age of CGI often overshadows: that atmosphere and exposition are still important, especially when dealing with cinematic icons."

","Around 15 minutes before this started I witnessed a disturbing fight 'with words' between Mother & Daughter. In the end, it put me in an awkward position and left me shaken! The result was me seeing the film alone! During the previews I felt sick and out of place. Then ""Van Helsing"" started!<br/><br/>It's a beautifully made film. The score is excellent! This film has everything! Continuous Adventure, Eye-popping Action, Great Characters, and Exquisite Special & Visual Effects. Kate Beckinsale was deliciously wonderful, as always! While Jackman gave a risky action-filled performance.<br/><br/>
The plot wasn't Oscar-worthy, however, was interesting!  'Helsing' has been criticized dearly by critics and Imdb Users alike for the fact that there's no plot, average acting, and cheesy monsters. I beg to differ.- Movies containing deep, well-written scripts, mesmerizing performances, and, in this case, extensive care in the visual aspect of creatures, and enabling the film to go overboard are excellent critically acclaimed films, which I enjoy most often. However, not every single film made has to fall under those expectations. We desperately need films where their main goal is to take you on a fun ride! I know I had a good ol' time while it made my troubles, before the movie, disappear! Simple as that!<br/><br/>My take on it: 8.5/10"

"squeezebox","2","0","0","11 May 2004"," A Spit in the Face to all Classic Monster Fans
","There are three things I liked about VAN HELSING: the first ten minutes, Kate Beckinsale's ass, and... actually, those two are it, unless you count each butt cheek separately.<br/><br/>What is with Hollywood? Why are they incapable of making action or horror movies of anything remotely resembling quality? Why do they feel that a couple of ""popular-this-month"" stars and overuse of lousy CGI effects make a movie? The fact that this movie is doing as well as it is just tells me that general American audiences are morons.<br/><br/>The director of this abominable piece of crap deserves to be drawn and quartered. I have never seen a movie that set up so many potentially great scenes, then proceeded to do nothing with them. You've got a movie featuring Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster, and the monsters never fight? Frankenstein's monster gets to beat up a female vampire in an all-too brief scene, Dracula and Van Helsing-turned-werewolf also duke it out in a mind-numbingly dull CGI-laden battle that looks like a video game. And why does Dracula have to turn into a giant bat monster to fight a werewolf. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to juxtapose Dracula in his human form duking it out with a hulking werewolf? Sure it would, which, I guess, is why they didn't do it. They're not interested in pleasing monster movie fans. They're interested in holding the attention of video game-jaded pre-teenagers. ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN had more effective action in it.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is great. Shot in beautiful black and white (which contemporary audiences are far too stupid to appreciate), it plays like a loving tribute to the classic Universal monster movies. However, it comes off like a mean joke to everyone who actually believed the filmmakers who swore this movie was in the spirit of the Universal and Hammer monster movies, when it suddenly turns into your typical post-MATRIX pseudo-goth action flick.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are both incredibly dull. Other than Beckinsale's aforementioned buns, which look great in her tight pants (which I'm sure were all the rage in early 1800s Europe), she is as boring a character as I can recall having seen in a movie. The screenplay is so awful, though, it's hard to blame it all on the actors. Van Helsing's sidekick, supposedly there for comic relief, is one of the screen's most hideously obnoxious characters in many years.<br/><br/>It's two hours of throwing glitzy hubbub at you to trick you into thinking something is happening, and about five too many scenes of people swinging through the air on wires. This movie sucks. I can remember, in my lifetime, when Hollywood had balls. It wasn't afraid to offend. It wasn't so obsessed with making money as to forsake making a good movie in the process. VAN HELSING is a good example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood. Too much money, too overblown, hokey humor, targeting the general demographic rather than the true fan, sacrificing intelligence in favor of spectacle. The filmmakers' contempt for their audience is worn on their sleeve.<br/><br/>And who thought Mr. Hyde should look like Shrek?"

","This movie is absolutely atrocious.  I had high hopes that Van Helsing would kick off the blockbuster season, but my hopes were dashed as I sat through this mindless drivel.  The movie was extremely disjointed and had too many things going on at one time.  As such, it seemed like they changed from scene to scene every couple of minutes which never allowed any part of the storyline develop satisfactorily.  With such a poor script, the actors were working at a major disadvantage from the outset.  Hugh Jackman (X-Men, X-Men 2) did as well as he could in the title role, but this movie was so poorly plotted and written that no actor had any hope of saving it.  Kate Beckinsale (Brokedown Palace, Underworld) portrays Jackman's love interest, gypsy princess Anna Valerious.  Beckinsale's role appeared to be to walk around in a tight leather outfit and to talk in a horribly stereotypical ""gypsy"" accent.  Richard Roxburgh (Mission Impossible:2, Moulin Rouge) plays a horribly ineffective Dracula.  Roxburgh's Dracula comes across as wimpish and not as the embodiment of evil that past movie Draculas have been. David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) is horribly miscast as Van Helsing's assistant, Carl.  The only saving grace of this film is its use of CGI to create visually stimulating scenery and monsters.  If the film had been written and produced by a Hollywood novice, I could understand.  However, Stephen Sommers wrote 1999's The Mummy which is one of my favorite films.  Of course, taking into consideration that I was disappointed with his follow-up efforts in The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King, I shouldn't be surprised.  I give Van Helsing a meager rating of 1.5 out of 5 stars. Save your money for some of this summer's upcoming films and wait for Van Helsing to hit video if you really must see it at all."

","So the dialogue is canned, the story is lacking humor, and the direction is weak. I cant really blame the actors too much here you can tell its what they had to work with, but the whole movie takes itself too seriously for what would be, sans the budget, a B movie. These guys should have taken a cue from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, another compilation of characters, that movie has a strong comic relief type character to balance all the unbelievable action, there was no relief here. Also it was hard not to make fun of the way too depressing Frankenstein. All and all this movie could have been done much better, but any time you have a writer, writing and directing, you are gonna lose perspective.<br/><br/>I gave it a 2.

","Well, I beg to differ.<br/><br/>I went expecting a darkish, stylish(ish) movie that would appeal to both kids and adults, light on plot and attention to detail. I was mistaken in my assumptions.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was cool, hard, and got the best lines. Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing... well, he was relatively hard I guess. Actually, he was a little too much so.<br/><br/>The old-school vampire hunter is an iconic image with his long coat, wide-brimmed hat and crossbow, even if this image has not been realised fully in cinema (Vampire Hunter D comes closest, but that's Manga crap). A guy decked out like that should be, well... cool. If Jackman, Sommers and the rest responsible for this debacle couldn't even pull that off, then the rest was doomed from the start.<br/><br/>Whilst the plots of most monster mash films are usually only scaffoldings for some set-pieces VH appears to have drafted in the storywriting talents of some actual scaffolders. Gosh! Frankensteins monster died really quick didn't he? He won't be coming back at all! Gosh! The Gypo prince died quickly, plummeting off-screen with a werewolf like that and all. I wonder if he was maybe bitten and might turn into a werewolf? No - surely not.<br/><br/>The real gripe of the film for me has to be the sheer level of 're-imagining' that has gone on. Obviously, the characters (Dracula, VH et al) are not going to be true to the source material, otherwise you wouldn't have a film. But if you are going to use the name of an established character there has to be SOME element of the original character in it. The 'real' literary VH was a) Dutch b) old and frail and c) a professor of medicine. This is slightly at odds with a hard transylvanian guy who killed Dracula when he was still a mortal. And who has been alive for at least 1800 years. Call me picky...<br/><br/>And whilst I'm being picky...<br/><br/>Yes, the crossbow looked cool. But why did it have a strut at all, given that it didn't do anything?<br/><br/>Gosh, what could an invention that produces a light as bright as the Sun do? And why couldn't the story monkeys work out whether vampires could cope with the Sun or not?<br/><br/>Anyone notice the ripping-off of the concept of Mr Hyde as the murderer at the Rue Morgue? And my, it was humorous to have him look like Wolverine, wasn't it? My mistake.<br/><br/>Overall, in MY humble opinion this movie was about as attractive and aromatic as a freshly laid dog egg. I haven't begrudged Â£5.00 as much as when I saw Dungeons & Dragons (I know - I got what I deserved with that one). Avoid.<br/><br/>
Oh yes, my fiance loved it - something to do with the lead. (And Frankensteins monster was well-realised)."

","Whatever happened to building to the big ending?<br/><br/>I watched `North By Northwest' a week ago, a film that was generally regarded as the best `action thriller' ever made to that point, (1959). It has, basically, three action scenes. The first is a semi-comical trip down a highway after the bad guys have kidnapped Cary Grant, drugged him up and put him in a car so he will crash and die. That comes about 15 minutes into the film. Most of an hour later comes the famous `Crop duster scene' where an innocent looking plane tries to do Cary in by clipping him with it's wings, machine gunning him and then fertilizing him to death before crashing in a ball of flame. Then, about half hour later, we get the famous escape over Mount Rushmore, where they wind up clinging to George Washington's nose. The rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between Cary and the bad guys and a romance between him and Eva Marie Saint. The whole thing doesn't make much sense but its fun and entertaining nonetheless. Still, to the kind of audience `Van Helsing' was created for, it must seem like pretty tame stuff.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is undoubtedly the first of many films trying to clone `Lord of the Rings' with its huge computer generated monsters and mass battle scenes. Like LOR, the special effects are amazing. But like LOR, the whole movie seems an exercise in special effects, as if that's all the audience came to see so that's what we will show them. There are perhaps a dozen action sequences in this picture, one right after the other, each one spectacular enough to have been the climax of a perfectly good action film. But because they are all so spectacular, their cumulative effect is to make each scene less amazing and less enjoyable. The lack of build up to them and the lack of character development to give them depth makes them less meaningful. It's like reading a comic book for two hours. When at the end, we realize how much Van Helsing has grown to love Anna, we wonder when he ever had time to do that between all the chases and battles with monsters.<br/><br/>
Still, I like this picture better than Lord of the Rings because it doesn't take itself so seriously. LOR was like a Wagnerian Opera. This film comes off as pure adventure because the characters have a sense of adventure and a sense of humor, if a sardonic one. But I would have liked it a lot better if it concentrated on developing character and atmosphere and saved the fireworks for the end.<br/><br/>In commenting on another action film I observed that the modern action film has become what the old fashioned Hollywood musical used to be. Whereas the musical used a slight plot to draw together the musical sequences, the modern action film does the same for action sequences. We used to see Fred and Ginger dance. Now we see stuntmen and CGI creations fight. But now it seems we have gone past even that to what amounts to a `clip show', virtually eliminating the plot, except for some shouted exposition, and giving us simply one breathless sequence after another. It all gets to be a little too much after a while. And there just isn't enough meat on the bones. <br/><br/>Those few action sequences in North by Northwest meant more because the people in them mattered to us. Now, who cares?"

","I was really looking forward to this - it sounded like it had all the ingredients for a fantastic monster movie. Saw it on Thursday preview night - couldn't wait. What a waste of time! The ideas were there, and there was the glimmer of the movie it might have been shining through from time to time, but for the most part I laughed with incredulity at how poorly it was executed. The CGI was terrible, the design of the monsters left an awful lot to be desired, and there was no dialogue or characterisation beyond what was necessary to move on to the next ""big set-piece"". I can't believe actors of the quality of Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were wasted so completely on roles which did not require them to act. Somebody stop Stephen Sommers from making movies - or at least stop me going to see them - please."

","If you want to hate this film, it gives you plenty of ammo.  The pacing is abysmal, it's full of pointless sub-plots that don't go anywhere, including a horde of evil monsters whose sole purpose is to explode pointlessly (err, make that three hordes in fact), so many 'deus ex machina's it's surprising they didn't all fall over each other, dreadful dialog, and everyone's favourite annoyance: gratuitous use of CGI.<br/><br/>So my advice would be: DON'T WATCH IT.  That is, unless you just want to sit back, switch off artistic judgement, suspend all belief, and just enjoy the show for what it is: a cheesy action flick with a few novel ideas.  See it with friends; laugh at how stupid it is; laugh at the cartoon laws of physics; laugh too at the witty one-liners, occasional comic timing, and joke references to other stories.<br/><br/>It's a shame that with better script-writing and direction, this could have been an excellent film.

If it were possible to get a refund of my time, I'd be the first in line.<br/><br/>What was so horrible you ask? OK, maybe I'm being a little hasty. It was not the worse movie I have seen, but it might bump Oscar (with Sylvester Stalone) out of the number 3 spot. The story, if you look at it in a very vague and abstract way COULD have been great. Yes, one might call the plot a bite trite- the same story has been done in one way or another several times that I can think of, but with just a bit more imagination, it could have worked. However, the writing was only adequate at best, and the acting, well... let's just say I enjoyed Hugh Jackman better in Kate & Leopold! Kate Beckinsale- the best thing I can say about her is at least she's pretty! Her acting was horrific and the poor girl couldn't have been costumed worse if my seven-year-old cousin drew the clothing on a paper towel!<br/><br/>
Each character seemed to be ripped from the pages of every bad Dracula/Frankenstein knock off ever made. Bram Stoker's Dracula it is not! Gee, it's not even Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series(even I wouldn't say Van Helsing was as bad as the Buffy movie)! The three brides of Dracula, think the movie Hocus Pocus (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker) add 5 cent vampire teeth from a vending machine and there ya go. <br/><br/>The overall feel of the film reminded me of a bad 1980's B horror film with just a bit of the old soap opera, Dark Shadows. You could have given be a computer from 1974 and I probably could have come up with better graphics and special effects. <br/><br/>OK, OK it wasn't a total waste. There was one bright spot. David Wenham was absolutely adorable as Carl, the geeky genius friar side-kick. He was funny, lovable, witty and if the rest of the film was even a trifle better, he'd have been a brilliant supporting actor. As we all know however, one actor can't save a film.<br/><br/>Now, I never said I did this for a living, but I know what I like and I can tell you, VAN HELSING IS NOT IT! There's no reason to spend any money or your time running out to see this film. Wait for it to come on HBO/Cinemax/Showtime/TMC/Starz real late at night when you can't sleep.

","And neither could this movie.<br/><br/>Now I appreciate it when a movie does a good job of combining several genres, and I could see what the makers of Van Helsing were trying to accomplish.  Unfortunately that seems to be the theme of movies today. Trying.<br/><br/>The first try was the horror aspect.  There were times when I literally jumped in my seat from fright.  At one point I almost screamed.  But these moments were so few and far between that calling this a horror film just doesn't quite fit.<br/><br/>The next try was the CGI.  A bad try.  The effects were sloppy at best, and so over the top in their attempts to make the actors look like they were the greatest gymnasts ever born that they were laughable.  Come on moviemakers! Whatever happened to a good old fashioned fight without having to hurl characters all over the horizon?<br/><br/>The third try was comedy.  This actually worked.  The friar who was a Q ahead of his time was hilarious.  If only we could have seen more of him and less of the action sequences!<br/><br/>The fourth try was action-adventure.  The problem was, instead of making Van Helsing a truly original character, they made him into a Wolverine brooding, Indiana Jones wannabe who dressed like a character from the Matrix.  Now I'll give kudos to Kate.  She looked awesome.  Better then I've ever seen her.  And the vampire brides were absolutely stunning on the ground.

","Alright, well to be completely fair, I walked into this movie pumped.  I had been looking forward to it since I first read the rumors.  Hugh Jackman is great and Beckinsale isn't too bad either, but they just couldn't pull this movie out of the rutt.  The movie got into this early pattern of dropping people from the top of things and just didn't seem to be able to stop.  I can't remember the last time falling was a chief plot device in a movie! Anyway, we are grounded in a certain love for the classic horror creatures (Drac, Frank, Wolfie) and to cheer against them we need to be given a certain motivation, i.e. connection to the hero who battles them.  Van Helsing just doesn't offer that.  I didn't care what happened to either of the heroes in the movie, no matter how many times they fell off of things. Thrills were not delivered, special effects were only semi-impressive while not realistic, and they played on the same old monster mashing traditions. Beckinsale seems strangely doomed to make Underworld over and over as it seems this was another werewolf versus vampire movie.  Weak plot, weak characters, weak movie, little or no originality.  Luckily, the constant action is just enough to keep you from realizing what the movie is till it's over.  In the end, it really feels like an episode of a Van Helsing cartoon than anything else. 5/10"

","There is nothing else out there that even mentions the classic movie monsters for many years.  For years films have dominated by Jason, michael Meyers, and psychos.  This film revives Frankenstein, wolfman and Dracula.<br/><br/>Obviously the film maker has much respect for the monsters of the past. This film, though, puts in intensive CGI and wild action to bring in younger viewers and does not have the subtle horror of the Hammer films and is not scary in that way.  I love films like The Ring or Mothman Prophesies or The Innocence.  This film is nothing like those. It is more in the style of Cutthroat Island and like League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. This film plays more like an adventure or science fiction.  Jackman is super as van Helsing fresh of his debonair performance in the good film Kate and Leopold.  He plays the part nothing like Peter Cushing but I think Cushing would like this film.<br/><br/>I have seen almost all the Dracula films including the old wolfman verses Dracula, Billy the Kid verses Dracula, and even the Laurel and Hardy monster films.  I believe the director has also.  I believe this current actor who played Dracula was the weakest part of this film but the film still holds up. Of course the most classic Draculas are the Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Hammer films.  They are beyond good.  This new film keeps the interest going in these interesting monsters for a new generation. There is also little gore or explicitness compred to so much out there so kids can see it but is is very intense.<br/><br/>It was also exciting and actually had a powerful but sincere ending.  I think an interesting thing this film changes after decades of beautiful enticing vampire women is to make the vampires more grotesque and less desirable.  This is a major change in the treatment of the vampiress.  In this film the vampire hunter was the gorgeous girl.  Also the Vatican is portrayed positively in the film as they are very concerned with fighting the forces of evil.  The Vatican hires Van Helsing to go and destroy Dracula.  The Vatican even has a secret factory that makes gadgets to battle evil kind of like James Bond.<br/><br/>I hope they make more of these but lets give Christopher Lee a part..  Also this may propel Jackman as van Helsing into consideration for the new James Bond.  This film is full of imagination and not boring!  Helsing stays true to tradition with lines like ""I can only kill something controlled by evil"" and has honor.  Also considering this is an action film there are some interesting philosophical lines.  Highly recommended!"

","Van Helsing was a decently entertaining movie.  It does not start off too well, but improves once the action picks up a little bit.  It does seem to use parts of other movies, but not necessarily monster movies as you would expect.  I definitely noticed scene or line similarities with LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Fifth Element, and The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly among others.  This is not a good thing.  It's OK to pay homage to classic movies of the same genre, but to take from a spectrum of different ones does not help a movie.<br/><br/>A lot of eye-rolling scenes, but entertaining enough. 7/10"

","Only going to mention a few of the reasons the movie lost me. 1 After the failure of league of extraordinary gentleman why bother using another failed Jekyl/Hyde CGI disaster.  Did not add anything.  2 Why add more rope swinging than a Tarzan movie.  3 Why waste the fantastic sex appeal of both the leading characters.  Costume design one high point of the whole thing.  Such a shame as you could see the care in the opening that it led to overblown shots that wasted the truely sinister nature of vampires and their blood sucking biology.  I am truly upset and angry about this movie.  A big CGI budget should be used sparingly.  The Mummy let you marvel at flesh eating scarabs and sinister sandstorms but here the effects just bored.  Remember less is sometimes so much more."
"scobbah","6","0","0","13 May 2004"," Too much action - lack of story
","After being served for nearly two hours of constant action, I could finally relax and breath. ""Van Helsing"" is filled with constant action, wicked combats, endless effects loaded together with some quick comments. I do think the whole movie started up well, but the more it developed the bigger the lack of story got, and the more action I was fed with. I think they went to much ""Matrix"" here, and lost the very important balance between having a good (deep) story and having awesome scenes of combat. Anyways, I experienced this piece at the cinema and I think that is a big plus, at least that is my conclusion. With all those visual effects and the astonishing audio experience it must be experienced at the cinema (or perhaps at home with some awesome audio equipment). <br/><br/>As my head still feels a little wicked and as I probably haven't really melted the piece yet, I still think that 6 out of 10 is a fair grade for ""Van Helsing""."

","Van Helshing could have been a great movie. Come to think of it, is had everything a movie needs to provide a fun couple of hours: vampires, women in sexy clothes (all hail Kate Beckinsale), vampire hunters and more women in sexy clothes who also happen to be vampires... So where did it all go wrong?<br/><br/>First of all the story is godawful and at times it feels like it was written by a 5 year old. First of all it is cliched to the point of stupidity a thing which is obvious right from the beginning since the movie starts with an angry mob carrying torches and pitchforks and heading to lynch Dr. Frankenstein. The first line we hear in the movie is the good doctor shouting ""It's alive, it's alive, it's alive"". Also In the same sequence Dracula uses the most used line in vampire films ""you can't kill me, i'm already dead..."" (note to writters: please stop using this line and its variations in everything about vampires, honestly, it's not even remotely funny anymore...) and of course Frankenstein is aided by Igor who (yeah you guessed it) is a midget with a hump on his back... The story also makes no sense at all: Dracula and his brides wants to release upon the world a horde of his offsprings (some gargoyle like small creatures) probably just for the fun of it since no reason as to why he wants to do it is given. To do that he needs to strap Frankenstein's monster in the machine that Dr. Frankestein used to give life to it. Van Helshing of course has to stop him  and kill him before he or his minions (including a werewolf) kills Anna, Kate Beckinsale's character. Brace yourselves for the stupidest plot device yet: Van Helshing works for the Vatican and Anna's family has made an oath to kill Dracula or forever rot in Hell. After an expected turn of events Anna is the last of her family and because her family has helped in the Vatican's war against monsters they can't let the eternal damnation of her family happen so they send in Van Helshing... The titular monster hunter is probably one of the swallowest characters ever seen in cinema. He kills monsters because... well because he is told he has to do so by the Vatican since he suffers from amnesia (amnesia seems to love Hugh Jackman since this is the second character (Wolverine was the first) he plays in a major movie who is troubled by it). To make matters worse, the audience is never given an answer to the most crucial question of the movie: who, or rather what the Hell is Van Helshing anyway?<br/><br/>The script is also dreadful and at times makes absolutely no sense. For example, two of Dracula's brides corner Anna and even though they are hell<br/><br/>bent on killing her, they chat with her for five minutes... I can imagine the end of the dialogue: ""Sooooooo and now that we've told you what Count Dracula is like in bed, we have to kill you. If that's ok with you, if not then we're obviously open to discussion...""<br/><br/>Then there's the acting... Acting is the movie's second big flaw. The only one of the major actors who manages to come out unscathed is Hugh Jackman. Kate Beckinsale and Richard Roxburgh (Dracula) are nothing but ridiculous with their very fake Romanian accents. Roxburgh's over-acting, especially in the first minutes of the film, along with some very bad dialog, render Dracula nothing short of a caricature, a thing that would be acceptable if the movie was presented as a parody, but unfortunately it isn't.<br/><br/>The film does have some good things going on for it. The amounts of action presented are huge and will satisfy even the hardest action junkie. The fact that the character's have no developement what so ever diminishes the amount of dialogue and raises the number of action scenes. In fact most sequences go a little like this: Van Helshing has an about one or two minutes long dialog with another character, usually with Anna, a monster attacks and an action scene ensues... So it never really gets boring. Most action sequences are good but some, like one involving six horses carrying a carriage and jumping in perfect unisson across a chasm, are plainly illogical and cause laughter.<br/><br/>The film's other high point is the way it looks. The cinematography is excellent especially an early vista of Paris with the Eiffel tower under construction in the background and Dracula's Ice Fortress  do manage to create a dark atmosphere. The costumes are also very good. But what steals the show are the special effects. The CGI werewolves are very realistic even up-close and the sequences of vampires turning to bat creatures and humans turning into werewolves as well as the final Dracula and Van Helshing showdown are breath-taking. All in all, the film is excellent eye candy.<br/><br/>Van Helshing is a bad movie almost in every aspect. If you expect a dark and most of all serious movie about the famous vampire hunter then avoid it at all costs. The film is so campy that at times it feels like a Saturday morning Cartoon (Toonsylvania sprung in mind when i heard and saw Igor...) If you want to see some really cool action scenes and SFX and you don't care much about trivial things like say a good story and plot than don't miss it. By the way, a note to Steven Sommers: there's a reason why people don't make movies like the monster movies of the 30s, that's because they now seem campy and ridiculous... Some things belong in the past. And a closing note to Kate Beckinsale: whatever they pay you, never, NEVER play in a film without using your native accent! Believe me it's for your own good.]<br/><br/>So from me Van Helshing gets a very generous 5 out of ten."

","I liked watching Van Helsing, the director created a dark, forbidding environment, and gave some of the characters a life and depth I wouldn't expect from a typical action flick. I found myself actually sympathizing with the 'bad guys' in the movie. *SPOILERS* For example, the Count seemed to be a father desperate to give his offspring life. His Brides also seemed a part of this,... less like scary monsters than predators higher on the evolutionary food chain. The 'humanizing' aspects of Frankenstein's monster and the werewolf seemed scripted, but understandable.<br/><br/>While Jackman was sexy as Van Helsing, I just wish Jackman's character was more developed, not just the typical 'well armed' muscle that runs around shooting things. Granted, he was very good at running around shooting things, but I thought his friar side-kick Carl showed more personality! If you are thinking of seeing this movie, go for the friar."

","A lot of special effects and a storyline that tries to justify them all. It was typical summer fare.  Hugh Jackman gave an admiral and strong performance as did Richard Roxburgh.  There were just some terribly annoying things to watch throughout:  (1) Kate Beckinsdale's perfect make-up, especially eyeliner, (2) her ridiculous clothing (3) the horrendous make-up job on Igor.<br/><br/>I viewed it as the first movie of the summer and gave it leeway as such. I thought Hellboy was a much better movie (considering what is in theaters now). I expect spectacle for summer.  This had the spectacle effects.

Dracula's wives were, IMO, the WORST part of this movie. I've seen better acting in high school plays. Campiness is good at times but they were beyond campy to being just dreadful. And those things that help Dracula, whatever they're called, looked like evil, demented Umpa Loompas. And Igor just had a horrible make-up job. And this Mr. Hyde business, can anyone say Shrek rip off?<br/><br/>Okay, now to what I liked. Yes, shocker, I liked parts of this movie. The score was THE BEST part. While I may never buy the movie I'm seriously considering purchacing the music. I also liked the camp, when it was done well. But I found myself laughing in weird places.<br/><br/>

Ah, but I didn't mind the way he looked. That HAIR! *faint* It's funny that anyone who had good hair never seemed to mess it up. Again, camp. Too bad there wasn't more of it, the movie would have been better. Campiness is what makes the Mummy good and that's why I like it.

","I keep seeing bad reviews for this movie, and I can't help but wonder why. I came into the movie expecting the worse. I've been disappointed by movies often lately, and the trailer for this one had all the symptoms. I wasn't even comforted by the fact that it was directed by Stephen Sommers, whose Mummy movies I really liked.<br/><br/>However, I can safely say that I left the movie completely satisfied and my faith in Stephen Sommers as a great ""adventure"" movie directory has been solidified.<br/><br/>Maybe people are looking to get too much out of this movie - I don't know. I never expected it to be an award winning movie. I just went into it to have fun. I'm a big fan of old monster movies, and this movie has numerous throwbacks to the old movies... I started laughing out loud at a lot of the camera work because it felt so much like a classic monster movie. They did an excellent job at paying tribute to a lot of the classic moments from these movies without obviously straying from the story.<br/><br/>The story was decent to good. There were a lot of elements I liked, but there wasn't a HUGE amount of depth to it (not necessarily a problem, in my eyes). My only real problems with the story were some rather large jumps they did from one scene to another without explaining the events in between very well.<br/><br/>The action was very well done, as was the accompanying computer graphics that made a lot of the scenes possible. The special effects weren't always on par with other recent movies, such as LGX, but they were definitely believable for the most part.<br/><br/>My vote for this movie was 8/10. I think it did what it set out to do - make a movie that paid a tribute to the monster movies of old, while giving audiences a fun filled two hour ride through a large cast of characters. The movie was just the right length, and besides some plot holes and CG problems, I was a happy movie-goer at the end of the experience. If you liked the Mummy, I can definitely recommend this movie."

The CGI comes off as just average.  The good points are the fusion of CGI on the vampires faces when they open their mouths wide to take bites.

","First off, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of the early Universal horror movies. These movies created the genre. My understanding was that Van Helsing was a modern, CGI-heavy homage to those early movies. The movie even begins where the Son Of Frankenstein left off. Except for the stellar perfomance of Karloff in The Mummy and the first 2 Frankenstein movies, almost all of the rest of the early Universal Dracula/Frankenstein/Wolfman movies were fun (and sometimes silly) popcorn movies. True, there was not a lot of room in this movie for deep acting and the story might even be considered campy, but that's ok. It was a fun addition to the Universal horror tradition.  I liked Jackman's Van Helsing character and David Wenham was great. There were a few questionable bits of dialog, a bad accent here and there, some borderline CG, etc, etc...but I enjoyed the movie a great deal."

","I'm glad I went into this movie knowing it was bad, so I wasn't disappointed. But still, I was unprepared for the horrors that ensued. Not from the monsters in the movie, but from the monster that WAS the movie.<br/><br/>There was NO plot or character development. I wasn't expecting much, but I thought there would at least be a linear set of events... instead, this movie jumps from one scene to the next with no rhyme or reason. Is it so much to ask that events follow some sort of order that makes sense?<br/><br/>The dialogue was amazingly cheesey. I've heard better dialogue from passed-out drunkards lying on the bathroom floor. The worst may have come from the Frankenstein monster, as he shouted out random Bible passages (Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...!"") and screamed ""I will have my revenge!"" in a rather menacing manner. Except he was addressing Dracula's ""helpers,"" these small Jawa-like creatures that were, apparantly, quite flammable. I have to hand it to the actors, though; they delivered all their lines without cracking up.<br/><br/>And the CGI. Dear God. What happened to guys running around in monster suits and stunt doubles beating the s*** out of each other? Must EVERYTHING be CGI? A CGI fight is hardly impressive. And if they must use it, why not try to make it look somewhat realistic?<br/><br/>Anyway, enough ranting. This is a fun movie, if you think stabbing yourself repeatedly with needles is fun. By the last third of the movie, half of the theater had left; only a dozen or so people remained when the credits finally rolled. It was bad. Really, really bad."

","Director Stephen Sommers has always turned out unique movie gems, so I was looking forward to Van Helsing when I went to see it this weekend. I had read some bad reviews for it and didn't have high hopes, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is possibly one of the most beautiful movies visually that I have ever seen. The special effects are wonderful, executed with finesse and talent. Sommers' vision of the creatures he has chosen to use in the movie makes them fresh, rather than the same tired old thing. All of the scenery is amazing, and I love the black and white sequence in the beginning that is a throwback to old horror movies. The camera angles and cinematography show that this crew knows their way around a movie set, and that's enjoyable.<br/><br/>The same can be said for Van Helsing's stunts. This movie is chock full of action, and the sequences are different each time and very charged. I jumped a few times out of surprise, and that doesn't happen very often. With lots of different locales for the fights, you get a variety of techniques and skills, and the fight scenes aren't so short that you find yourself disgusted at the character being invincible, but not so long that you're looking at your watch waiting for it to be over. Each character also gets equal pieces of the action, so it's not all Hugh Jackman running around beating people up.<br/><br/>The movie is very well-cast. Jackman plays an excellent hunter of evil, with just the right amount of spunk for a man in his position. Dracula is appropriately devious and cunning, with even bigger schemes than Bram Stoker imagined for him. The surprise fun character is Carl, the equivalent of 007's Q. He makes all the gadgets and is the brains of the operation, even managing to throw a few punches himself. Kate Beckinsale (who I admire for not passing out in that tight costume) is much better as a spirited princess than the brooding vampire she played in Underworld, and proves that she can tackle the fantasy genre successfully.<br/><br/>The one disappointment I had with this movie was that it has very little plot. I was left at the end wanting to know more about Van Helsing, where he came from, and why he ended up the way he did. To be fair, Stephen Sommers may be planning a sequel, but it is confusing when you don't have a lot of information at the end of the movie, because the Dracula mythology is wonderfully woven and detailed. I'm interested to see if there is more to this franchise than just the first movie, as there was with Sommers' hits (and movies I loved) The Mummy and The Mummy Returns.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie gets an 8 out of 10 from me, and I'm interested to see where it could go in the future."

","Hugh Jackman seems to be going for as many franchises as possible.. which, all things considered, is fine by me. He's fun to watch, and probably the number one reason I even went to see ""Van Helsing"". Number two reason was, after I read the original ""Dracula"" I found out that Van Helsing was a great character. The movie Van Helsing, while still a worthy character, needed a lot more development and depth than the screenwriter and director went for. Coherent dialogue would have helped.  The writing was pretty bad all through, and the accents were *terrible*, especially Anna's. Richard Roxburgh was entertaining but not particularly scary... actually, nothing in this movie was very scary. David Wenham has definitely crossed wide rivers since his stony, slightly boring Faramir in the LOTR movies, and ended up being my favourite thing about this whole debacle. The special effects only succeeded about half the time, but some of them were quite impressive--- such as the shimmery air around the vampires as they flew, and the light shooting out of Dracula's townhouse after the ball. My one really big problem with this movie, though, was the fact that it didn't *really* star Hugh Jackman. It starred his microphone. I've never seen so much microphone before in any movie, and it took an awful lot away from scenes that had a hard enough time as it was anyway. I don't really want to complain. This was just a summer movie, and summer movies are never great. They could have put a lot more into it, though... oh well. Maybe for the sequel."

"mrswhite072895","6","0","0","12 May 2004"," A solid and fun monster hunting movie to usher in the summer season
","I did myself a great disservice by reading many of the negative newspaper reviews of the movie Van Helsing, because I couldn't watch the first twenty minutes without noticing the supposed flaws of the flick. However, that passed and I was able to enjoy the 2 hour-10 minute film (2 hours and 23 minutes if you can't the end credits). Let me say that the critics are being unnecessarily harsh on Stephen Sommers and Van Helsing. It is not an Oscar-worthy that will be remembered by the AFI thirty years from now, but it is a film that will take you out mind.<br/><br/>The plot is a very simple, but not so simple as to offend your intellect. Hugh Jackman (of the X-men movies and the Tony-nominated musical ""The Boy from Oz"") plays Gabriel Van Helsing, a monster hunter for a secret sect of the Catholic Church. From what we see of the sect's headquarters, it isn't only the Catholics who are employing Van Helsing to save the souls of those possessed by evil. It is in these secret headquarters hidden in the Vatican City that the audience learns that the Church rescued a broken and amnesiac Van Helsing several years ago, and it is through his monster hunting/soul saving that he will recall his forgotten past. (POSSIBLE SPOLIER HERE!) We also learn here that his past goes as far back as 800 years from the present 1888 of the movie. <br/><br/>Van Helsing is then sent to Romania to help a gypsy princess, played with butt-kicking and back-flipping furor by Kate Beckinsale, defeat Count Dracula. Kate Beckinsale's Anna Valerious is the last one in the family who is cursed to eternal damnation unless Count Dracula is killed by them. Dracula and his three vampire brides have it out for the Valerious clan, and the reason why is a surprise. During their mission to find and destroy Dracula, as well as his undead children that he is trying to bring to life with the help of Dr. Frankenstein's technology, Anna and Van Helsing fight vampires, the werewolf, an angry crowd, and Frankenstein's monster before befriending him.<br/><br/>Like ""The Mummy,"" director Stephen Sommers does not allow his heroes to have a healthy fear of their enemies. They have too much of a jaded, 21st Century attitude. If the characters aren't even a bit afraid, how is the audience supposed have a suspension of disbelief? Aside from this flaw and the obvious set up for sequel through several of Dracula's allusions to Van Helsing's past, this is a solid and fun summer movie. It is to his credit, that Sommers doesn't make the movie as serious or as dark as other vampire films of recent history (like ""Interview with the Vampire,"" ""Bram Stokers' Dracula,"" and ""Underworld""). Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale play the swashbuckling roles with the right balance, and Shuler Hensley's Frankenstein's monster gives the movie a soul. In helping to keep the film light, Richard Roxburgh does an excellent job of camping up Dracula but not to the point where he can't be perceived as a formidable foe. The movie is not as overblown, bloated, or as weighed down by special effects as the critics would have you believe. Aside from the CGI that makes the simplest human movement appear as supernatural and too perfect, the movie makes good use of its stunts and F/X budget. This movie is a way to usher in the lazy, hazy days of summer. Just pray they don't do a sequel."
"johnnymonsarrat","4","0","0","12 May 2004"," Jon Monsarrat review: Good acting, silly action
","I love action films and I don't need a lot of drama -- Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwartzenegger are fine. But I like the action to be clever, with some plot twists and powerful tension. Not in this film. Van Helsing has some strong acting by Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxburgh, but it's just tremendously silly. Sort of like ""The Mummy"", where someone shouts ""Place the amulet into the magic box and make the secret cross and spinkle some sand over the tomb quick before the pharaoh ghost of the hell people blinks twice before midnight!"" Yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>A lot of films get caught up in this trap. Rather than making a dramatic impact with a rich personal story (something that Hellboy attempts, but fails)... they try to shock us with a lot of monsters. But there are so many of them and different types and exceptions and silver crosses work on some but not others... it all melts down into so much uninteresting bother. Where's the dramatic tension if the plot is too silly to be believed?<br/><br/>There is a touch of bona fide action in the movie but a lot of it is hammed up as well. You know, conveniently placed ropes for swinging. There is a lot of swinging in the film. Apparently if you grab someone at the end of a 10 story fall the instant deceleration doesn't kill them. Huh. What do you know.<br/><br/>I did feel the visual flying effects worked better than Spiderman (which just left me dizzy and disoriented). Kate Beckinsale isn't given much of a role, and she does nothing with it. I didn't see any chemistry, romantic or otherwise.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Hugh Jackson fans, but only on a rainy day.<br/><br/>-- Tall guys whose heads blink but they're really good, not evil<br/><br/>I nearly gave Van Helsing a 5 out of 10 but those silly Eastern European accents... argh...

"livewire-6","Null","0","0","12 May 2004"," Evil without reflection
","We all know that Dracula, or any vampire, cannot be seen in a mirror. ""Van Helsing"" is the same. It is evil without reflection. At least Dracula has the excuse of being undead. ""Van Helsing"" is far worse. It is brain-dead.<br/><br/>The film never pretends to be anything other than park-your-mind-at-the-door entertainment, in the tradition of fast-paced, car-chase-filled, action-adventure flicks. Given its subject matter, ""Van Helsing"" could and should have tried to be something more. Its failure to rise above the abysmal is an abdication of moral responsibility.<br/><br/>The film offers the semblance of evil without examining its nature or reality. It trots out all the classic ghouls - vampires, werewolves, Jekyll and Hyde, Dr. Frankenstein and his monster - without stopping to consider what makes them such powerful archetypes, or why they are deemed the embodiment of evil.<br/><br/>Even a cursory examination would have revealed the answer. All of them are unnatural exaggerations of an aspect of human nature. Both Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein represent people's wish to ""be as gods"" - to quote Genesis - to be immortal or to unlock the secret to life. (Van Helsing himself seems to live forever. He remembers fighting Romans at Masada in 73 AD.) Hyde and the werewolf, on the other hand, show us at our worst, when we allow ourselves to be dominated by our animal instincts.<br/><br/>Frankenstein's monster holds out a ray of hope as the one creature that is non-human yet not inhuman. Van Helsing says he cannot kill Frankenstein's monster because, although it may be the fruit of evil, it is not ruled by evil.<br/><br/>Apart from this one bright spot, however, the film's moral vision (if you can call it that) is chilling indeed. Ultimately, ""Van Helsing"" suggests that evil must be defeated and destroyed by evil itself. The film offers no choice between good and evil. It allows us only to choose the lesser of two evils.<br/><br/>The film uses the props of Christian theology without its underpinnings. Churches become mere architectural splendors, not holy but hollow. No divine worship takes place beneath their vaults. God and the devil are mentioned in passing, but neither has any real presence. (I use the term deliberately.) Reference is made to sin and salvation - but they are merely meaningless buzzwords. Holy water and the crucifix no longer vanquish evil.<br/><br/>At no time in the proceedings does ""Van Helsing"" ever manage to be scary. The only truly frightening thing about the film is that, as the saying goes, it ""sees no evil"". If this is any indication of how far our society has lost its moral compass, then we must indeed ""be afraid - be very afraid""."

CGI Monsters are pathetic Mr Hyde is a cross between a giant leprechaun and that fat character from Austin Powers. As for Dracula he sounded like Steve Coogans Tony Ferrino character, i would go on record as saying this is the worst Dracula i have ever seen, a pathetic performance. The Werewolf and Frankensteins monster are given nothing to do after a bright beginning that could of done with being in colour. I Loved Deep Rising, I loved The Mummy.

Unfortunately all those things are true. <br/><br/>The opening sequence (shot in black and white) is quite okay, but after that it gets worse. When in the beginning of the movie Van Helsing fights some Hulk-like monster I was already bored and thought ""just kill it and let's get over with"", but unfortunately the fight lasts quite a while. I could not at all relate with the characters, neither with Van Helsing nor with Anna Valerious, even Count Dracula remains bland and uninteresting. Besides you don't learn anything about their motivation. Also the fact that Van Helsing mostly fights CGI-beings and does not get even a scratch during those fights does not exactly further the tension. In addition the movie is quite foreseeable. And Carl as Van Helsing's sidekick/comic relief is not funny at all and the one liners the characters get to speak are just stupid. The only reason I didn't leave the cinema before the end of the movie was that I was curious about the final fight between Count Dracula and Van Helsing, but even that fight was not worth the wait.<br/><br/>The acting was okay I think, but I had the impression that in a bad movie even decent actors look bad.<br/><br/>The CGI was way too much, human adversaries might have been much more interesting to watch, so it was more like style over substance.

","First off, if you go to this movie thinking you are going to see a classic you are wrong. But with that said, this movie was enjoyable, even with all the CGI (the Jekyll and Hyde CGI was the worst). Hugh Jackman does a good job as the title character, Kate Beckingsale is obviously gorgeous and adds some very welcome aspects. What I really like about this movie is the fact that all of the monster's stories are woven together in a way I have never seen before. Even though some people here say there is no character development, there is some. There are some things I could have done without, especially in the last 10 minutes or so but I won't spoil it for anybody here. I suggest that anyone who wants to see a decent move that is pure escapism - go see this. One last note, I have NEVER agreed with Roger Ebert but I love that he gave this movie a thumbs up."

"gregsrants","4","0","0","9 May 2004"," Hollywood tries to cheat and pack in the familiar faces
","If there was any truth to the notion that Hollywood has run out of new ideas and even less unique characters, one has to look no further than the recent crop of box office fodder we have been fed over the past few years.<br/><br/>In efforts to rip our hard earned dollar from our pockets with once proven yet stale characters, the cinema has tried a new approach of coupling these faded franchises into the same story.  One only needs look at Freddy vs. Jason, Aliens vs. Predator or even the notably bland League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to see the newest trend of familiar characters against a common enemy.<br/><br/>The recent attempt at this warfare tactic is the biggest and boldest risk yet in Universal Studio's Van Helsing.  With adds swarming about a one man's crusade against the Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein it's a way of almost tricking the audience into thinking they are getting three movies for the price of one.  Add Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde who makes a rather large cameo early on in the film and you have seasons one through four of the X-Files minus any alien abductions.<br/><br/>For those of you who may not be aware of this almost a quarter of a billion dollar adventure (this number includes the lucrative advertising budget and sequel rights), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in the X-Men franchise) plays the title character who is commissioned by the church to rid the world of the evil creatures it harbors.  After a memorable chase with Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing is dispatched to Eastern Europe to stop Dracula and his gang of monsters from channeling the efforts of Dr. Frankenstein and bringing to life the dead offspring of the Count and his wives.<br/><br/>Conceding that this is not enough to propel a blockbuster film, we also are introduced to the lovely Kate Beckinsale (who no doubt was still wearing the same wire harness she perfected in last years Underworld) as Anna Valerious, the last in a line of hereditary challenges for the Dracula family.  Van Helsing's role is then quite clear, he must save the Valerious family and set them free from purgatory, foil the plans of the count, hide his decision to save the Frankenstein monster from his superiors while trying to race against time and find not only the answers to his own legacy but also to inject himself with a cure for the Wolfman curse to which he has been infected.  Whew!<br/><br/>You would think that with all this going on, all these familiar evil characters that we grew up on with Saturday afternoon matinees, that we would be in for a roller coaster ride of the can't fail variety.<br/><br/>
If you thought as did I, you are in for a disappointment.<br/><br/>As a critic, it is always easier to pick out the bad in films, so let me start there.  Even though writer/director Stephen Sommers has given Universal an incredibly lucrative franchise in The Mummy (followed by The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King, the three combined for nearly $850 million at the worldwide box office), he has never been one much for character development.  A master of the special effects and CGI action, I would expect that when storyboarded, this film must have looked incredibly fun with the studio licking its chops at the theme park possibilities. However, when put on the big screen, the characters were all bland. Dracula was never frightening, Frankenstein was a wimp (granted if you read the book, it stays true to his good nature), and only the Wolfman offers any kind of real peril.<br/><br/>With the supporting cast as backdrops, the hopes would be that the leading crew of Jackman and Beckinsale would rise to the occasion, but together they offer not one ounce of chemistry and although human fighting the supernatural they seem to be able to fall from incredible distances or get thrown into walls without as much as an Advil for back pain.  If these characters don't seem to falter after being manhandled by creatures ten times their strength, then where is the adventures?  Where is the sense of urgency?<br/><br/>Granted, I am not blaming the two leads for this mess.  They really didn't have anything to work with.  The whole cast are forced to not show smiles while uttering such as `I don't know if you've looked in the mirror lately, but you kind of stick out in a crowd' (said to Frankenstein) or `Too bad, so sad' as orated to Van Helsing to by one of the Counts evil brides.  Even when they are trying to be funny, they don't seem to hit on any consistent cylinders.  It actually reminded me of The Mummy Returns in 2001 when I witnessed what I still profess today to be the only movie that has over 50 attempts at humour and does not hit one note.  Van Helsing is just as bad. When a friar walks into a room just vacated by the Wolfman, he asks rhetorically, `What smells like wet dog in here?' and when Igor is asked why he tortures the Wolfman he says, `It's what I do' in a very annoying accent. When these and countless other expected catchphrases were thrust upon the audience, I swear, you would hear crickets in the background where the director paused in the action expecting laughter.<br/><br/>To give the film its chops, I will say that the production values and the special effects are top rate.  In fact, that is the only reason why the film will be a success and not end up on cable as quick as LXG.  The Wolfman was evolved to a point where watching even An American Werewolf in London might now finally seem dated.  And it was more 21st century to see Dracula turn into a six-foot bat instead of a flying rodent that we were used to in the old Bela Legosi films.<br/><br/>This movie is however critic proof.  Fans of the genre have been awaiting it with bated breath and the 2004 summer film fleet is now aligned and firing with this early entry.   It is just too bad that they couldn't have done more or in looked at previous attempts and done less.  If Daredevil and Electra fighting Bullseye and The Kingpin were a benchmark, Universal should have taken a page from this lesson to learn that more sometimes isn't always better.<br/><br/>All this said, I am developing a script for Pee Wee Herman vs. the Star Wars Jawa's that I hope you buy into next year."

","Okay, So you won't leave this movie feeling enlightened or emotionally effected....so what? Not EVERY movie needs to be an intellectually moving experience. Sometimes you just need some cool, exciting fun. And that's what Van Helsing offers. Enjoyment. I really liked this movie, and as far as action movies go, this is one of the best I've seen in a while. The cast was pretty good, and I have a biased love for David Wenham, who plays the funny, genius, sidekick Carl, because of his role in Lord of the Rings. He was very good, as was Hugh Jackman. It was action packed, and interesting and no yawns were involved!

","Ridiculous stunts that defy the laws of physics and a simple one-dimensional screenplay drag this down. The action sequences could have been trimmed a bit, but it is surprising how well the single plot-line with short, go-nowhere subplots keeps its momentum. The atmospherics of the movie are good -- think Sleepy Hollow meets Two Towers. Jackman plays a very Wolverine like character. So most of this is a derivative hodge-podge of cliched eye-candy from other better sci-fi, fantasy and suspense films -- Matrix, Alien, X-men, Batman, James Bond, etc. Even Silvestri's Gothic-Wagnerian score sounds familiar from other movies. Nevertheless, it is fun to watch Jackman tackle various monsters. His female sidekick does an adequate job, but plays up arrogance and vulnerability and downplays the sort of intensity that the character needed, more in the direction of Linda Hamilton in T2, Sigourney Weaver in Alien(s)."

This film was really created for pure escapism, a chance to exit reality, and it does this perfectly.

There was little to no logical connection between the characters. The brides of Dracula were so under developed that it would have been more effective to not have them speak. The claim was that this movie would be like Indiana Jones, but the only similarity was the hat Jackman wore. Beckinsale relied way to much on her looks and didn't bother to bring any real acting to the movie, which is a shame because I enjoyed her in Underworld.

","Van Helsing is not a great movie, I'm afraid. It's not even a good one. It's vaguely significant in that it's the first time since ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" came out (that'd be in 1948) that Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolfman have appeared in the same film. Too bad it was this one.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (who was a lot more entertaining as Wolverine in the X-Men movies) stumbles and lurches through this mish-mash of well-meaning special effects sequences to no clear end. The story is muddy--it seems as if they must have had more script than film, and had to do the best they could with the resources available--and where it seems to proceed along some sort of coherent line, which it does for moments at a time, the directions it takes leave you scratching your head.<br/><br/>Jackman is Gabriel Van Helsing, apparently no particular relation to the Abraham of Dracula fame, who gets sent hither and yon by some secret gang within the Roman Catholic Church (a concept which makes its appearance in a single scene and then vanishes, never to be heard from again--there's a lot of that sort of thing in this film) to retrieve or kill various supernatural baddies. Presumably as a result of these activities, Van Helsing is himself a wanted man, a fact made clear in the opening sequence of the movie and, likewise, never referred to for the entirety of the remainder of the picture.<br/><br/>In an early sequence, he does battle with Mr. Hyde (who comes off a little, but not a lot, better than he did in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a film which seems to have presaged many of the flaws of Van Helsing) and then gets sent off to Transylvania to deal with Dracula himself, who's planning (I think) to take over the world with thousands of bat-like ""offspring"". The little batlings are lying dormant in globby cocoons reminiscent of the wad of goo that Natasha Henstridge burst out of in Species, but aren't quite alive, or undead, or something: they need to be zapped with electricity run through Frankenstein's monster--juicing 'em through a werewolf is suboptimal--in order to enable them to flap around without their exploding into gobbets of green goo, a fact which has Dracula's three wives extremely depressed.<br/><br/>In an early sequence that's probably as good as this movie gets, Van Helsing dispatches one of the harpy-like wives with a Gatling crossbow provided by his assistant, the Friar (""I'm not actually a monk..."") Carl, who acts more-or-less as Q to Van Helsing's James Bond. The special effects here are okay, but as CGI-heavy as any of Sommers' previous films. And like The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, the production values overall are quite good--sets, costumes, make-up are all great. Not put to any especially worthwhile use, but good eye-candy, for the most part.<br/><br/>Speaking of eye-candy, Kate Beckinsale plays the local princess whose family has sworn to destroy the vampire, and who apparently devote themselves to werewolf-baiting in the meantime.<br/><br/>If all of this sounds disjointed and silly, it's only because it is. The script is a knot of non-sequiturs, dead-ends and pointless excursions, and Sommers--who has a pretty good eye, but not much of a sense of what makes sense, it seems--does, I suppose, the best he can with it. He'd be in a decent position to blame this morass on the writer, except for one thing: he is the writer.<br/><br/>Do I sound disappointed? Well, I got to see a couple of good trailers.<br/><br/>Of course, that's what I said about this one. If you've been wanting to see this, see The Mummy instead: it's funnier, tighter and better directed by a big margin. Wait for this to come out on DVD. Then wait some more."

The animation of Dracula's Brides was really lovely, as were many of the CGA landscapes.

","Being a big fan of Sommers two Mummy movies, I was really looking forward to this one.  The Mummy movies were poorly reviewed, as Van Helsing was, so I wasn't discouraged.  While I can't say the movie was bad, it wasn't great, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>I think the great weakness of the film was that Sommers just had too much money to work with and didn't have to make any decisions.  If you listen to the director commentary for the Mummy and Mummy Returns, you hear him talk about the choices they had to make and the tricks they had to pull because of limited budgets.  I think Sommers did very well with those constraints. After seeing how he behaves on an essentially unlimited budget, I think he needs the constraints of a tight budget to be effective.<br/><br/>As a general case in point, CGI was limited in the Mummy movies and Sommers comments on how much it cost to get effects shots done.  This time around, the effects shots are so numerous and overwhelming that they detract from the overall experience.  Instead of being there to advance the story, they are there to simply impress.  It's unfortunate, because the price paid is in plot and character development, of which there is sadly very little. There's just not enough substance to make a connection with Van Helsing and Anna, the way you do with O'Connel and Eve in the Mummy movies.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this one as a rental.

","Van Helsing is one long trailer - but in a good way. I feel you will either love it or loathe it.

From there the plot <coughs> moves on at some pace. In fact if you drew a really big breath you could probably tell the whole plot in one sentence and not go blue in the face but hey, I'm not complaining. The accents are acceptable but I think they paid too much attention to sounding Romanian rather than actually acting so it's a bit ropey in that department. I don't really think Kate Beckinsale got the part for her acting though.<br/><br/>It's not really a horror film, it's not really a spoof, its somewhere in between and that is it's major flaw.

I can't believe how 3 classic characters can be ruined in less than 2 hours and 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The start was decent. I like the black and white start. Gave the movie a good mood. But when Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) comes on, the movie starts to crumble. From the lame jokes to the lame acting, nothing was going right for this movie.<br/><br/>Why is Frankenstein made such a fool in this movie? He isn't suppose to think, and he is only suppose to listen to his father, the creator. If your going to use classic horror characters, don't ruin the character. Wolf Man was used in a decent way, and Dracula was done good besides the fact that he had a bunch of Oompa Loompa's running around doing all this work for him. What is he now, Willy Wonka?<br/><br/>The concept of how to kill Dracula was heavily modified, which is understandable considering it would be easy with the original garlic, stake through heart, and cross. I was hoping the way to kill Dracula would be better, but to end it the way it did made the story crap. The connections were way too easy to make, it didn't involve any thinking.<br/><br/>The action scenes were crap. I knew the action scenes would include CGI, but the whole damn thing was made with CGI! I mean, directors are getting so lazy nowadays. I was hoping for some battles that actually looked real.<br/><br/>Overall, probably one of the worse movies of the year so far. The only thing that kept me awake was seeing Ana, damn she's hot. Other then that, Hugh Jackman should stick to <b>X-Men</b>.<br/><br/>Plot: 6 Acting: 6 Direction: 5 Visuals: 5 Overall: (not an average) 6"

","I have to admit that this movie was a complete mess.  But i did find it amusing and entertaining.<br/><br/>I'd say that the plot of Van Helsing and how everything tied together was interesting, but i don't think it was executed properly.  The timing for certain characters to show up and do their part was just too perfect, and too coincidental.  I also noticed that the villains spent way too much time talking when they could have finished off whoever they needed to there and then.<br/><br/>But if you ignore the silly nicks about the film and just enjoy it as an entertaining two hours, I'd recommend it.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Nephalim","Null","0","0","8 May 2004"," The Newest Trend?
","This isn't a review of this particular movie. I thought it profoundly mindless, but fun enough to make up for it. I think the CG was a tad overused, and didn't look all that good most of the time. I was particularly unimpressed with the Dracula creature. But that's pretty much all I have to say about it. It was harmless. Not good enough to leave any lasting impression, but not bad enough to make me care enough to hate it.<br/><br/>But I just can't get over this crossover trend that was set with League of Extraordinary Gentlemen last year. There have been several movies since that throw a bunch of characters from different franchises into the mix. Even though the Alamo is supposed to be a historical docudrama or whatever, it seemed strange to see Jim Bowie and Davey Crockett in the same story. So count that one, or don't, if you wish. Freddie vs. Jason pitted the two famed slasher movie icons against each other, and Alien vs Predator does the same with the equally iconic sci/fi monsters.<br/><br/>All right, two in one, that's not that bad. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was just ridiculous, of course, with dozens of literary sources mangled in a shredder and thrown together, barely stitched together to form what some might consider a moderately coherent plot. We've got, like, ten different books colliding in this movie. Apart from the League itself, there were further references to others, including Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>But that one we can let go, because it's based on an old comic or whatever. Fine. The movie was bad enough on it's own.<br/><br/>Van Helsing, however, does this so overtly and so needlessly that you really have to wonder what anyone was thinking. It's the League of Extraordinary Universal Monsters. If you haven't seen the movie, you likely already know that it features Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolf Man. However, it also feature's Mr. Hyde in a utterly unnecessary preamble. And not only does this seem out of place in the company of these classic monsters, but it's hinted that Hyde is also the Hunchback of Notre Dame, AND Jack the Ripper. These references just seem thrown in for the sake of throwing them in.<br/><br/>I seriously don't know what the hell they can do with the sequel you know they're going to make, unless it's just the same movie over again, with all the dead villains either coming back or turning out not to have died. Maybe we'll get computer-animated flashbacks to enlighten us.<br/><br/>I swear to God, Bram Stoker must be wishing he could rise from the grave and wreak his terrible, vampiric revenge upon all the different bastardizations of EVERY possible character he created. Dracula's been done to death, of course. The League butchered Mina Murray, and now Van Helsing has turned its titular character into something that barely resembles the guy we met in the book. Should we expect ""Jonathan Harker"" coming in 2005? Starring Keanu Reeves as an vampire hunter who engages hordes of identical undead in slow-motion kung-fu brawls? Or, better yet, ""Westernra"" starring - oh, I don't know, Drew Barrymore, let's say - as Lucy Westernra, turned vampire, but kept her soul or something, and so uses her supernatural undead powers and sex appeal to fight evil. It'll be like ""Angel,"" except she's a chick.<br/><br/>You might laugh or roll your eyes, but if Van Helsing has been any indication, we are not that far off.<br/><br/>Maybe Somers thought this would be a dud, and so tried to cram in every monster he could find because he didn't think he'd get another chance. Or maybe he has a terminal illness or something. Because this is what he loves doing - taking classic, iconic figures and revisiting them in new and occasionally moderately interesting ways.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Van Helsing was NOT one of those occasions.<br/><br/>Well, what do you know, I guess this sort of WAS a review of the movie."

","Van Helsing was probably one of the funnier movies I've seen for a while. Or wait.. What's that you say? It wasn't supposed to be a comedy? Wow.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about this movie was how beautiful it was. The cinematography, sets, costumes, and cast were all wonderful as many of the people here have said. But there was still one thing missing here: a real plot and characters.<br/><br/>When I first went to see this movie, I was expecting an anime-style action movie, but when I first laid eyes on the poorly portrayed Mr. Hyde and Werewolves, I was about ready to leave the theater. I was reminded of the graphical disappointments that were ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" and ""Underworld"". When is Hollywood going to get it through their heads that Mr. Hyde is not some strange, hunch-backed hairy creature incapable of normal speech? It's like they took the original character and gave him steroids along with a little bit of cocaine. As for the werewolves, I am absolutely disgusted. Now I know we all have our own images of what werewolves should look like, but come on! At least don't give us these hyeana-headed disproportionate monstrosities! It completely ruins the movie. They could have used sockpuppets with mean faces drawn on them and gotten a better effect.<br/><br/>The second thing in this movie that completely cracked me up was the scene where Van Helsing sticks his hand into the mirror and says the line ""it's cold"". It's so obviously stolen from The Matrix that they might as well have had a million Agent Smiths come out of the castle and attack the poor villagers.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that ""stealing"" certain things makes a movie bad. Believe it or not, most movies have copied off one another since the beggining of film making. Shakespeare's plot points and situations have been used countless times (e.g. ""10 things I Hate About You""). I thought Van Helsing portrayed Dracula very well.<br/><br/>You have to admit that to make a movie like Van Helsing would have been very difficult. First of all, you would have to know all of the stories and characters by heart. Looking back on what your fourth grade teacher told you, write (ahem...direct) what you know. The Director/Writer of this movie obviously did not know very much about any of his characters except possibly Dracula. Van Helsing can be looked at as a failure to learn from. And hey, it's not even that much of a failure. Besides, it will give you a few good laughs.<br/><br/>
P.S. What's all of this bashing of 13 year olds? I'm thirteen and I find it quite offensive when people like floridanate practically segregate us from the rest of society by saying that ""we may very well enjoy this film"". It's not like I can get away with saying ""Those childish white people may very well enjoy this film"". Keep that in mind for the next time you feel like insulting a general group of people for no particular reason."

This movie is very enjoyable. It was just entertaining and nothing more. I wasn't a fan of the acting or writing and with the budget, I wasn't to thrilled with the special effects. Although at the very beginning with the black and white, the special effects were very good. All around ,though, they did a pretty good job in it.

","Yes, this movie has tons of plotholes. Yes this movie has all sorts of small flaws. Do those things matter to this movie? No, they do not. And why don't they matter? Because this is a James bond meets medieval fantasy. I had fun watching this movie. The people that went to see this movie and claims here that they would've ""stormed the box office and demanded the money back for the entire audience"" and request that the director should apologize in public for this movie, are idiots. This is a movie you watch if you like gung-ho action, to be suspended in disbelief by something so outré that no way in hell could this ever be real. And none of it can of course. But that's the beauty of it. This movie takes something so far out, so outrageous as this is, and turns it believable.<br/><br/>This is a great new action-movie. Action movies were best in the 80's and since then the genre has degenerated into horrible movies featuring The Rock or clever things with cool gimics, like The Matrix and Boondock Saints. This is more true to the action legacy of movies like Indiana Jones and James Bond than even the new James Bond movies.<br/><br/>Fun movie, but not a great movie. And there's a difference there. You can hammer this movie all you want, but that won't change that fact that it's still fun and you can enjoy yourself with this piece of excellent escapism. Just don't for one second think that it will contain a hidden message that will cause every person in the world to realise the errors of their ways and love each other.<br/><br/>8/10, judged like an actionmovie, not as a poetical masterpiece."

The special effects are riveting in some places, cartoonish in others.  The sexy yet sexless harpies may rate Oscar consideration for special effects.  Jackman, Beckinsale and Roxburgh all have a strong ""presence"" in the film, something I always look for. The movie has elements of not only Dracula and Frankenstein, but also of James Bond and Lord of the Rings, and probably other stories and films that I have missed.  A couple of plot and theme elements are unresolved at the end, leaving open the possibility of a SEQUEL--the dreaded ""S"" word.<br/><br/>--Spoiler-- Two characters who you would expect to die in movies of this genre are still alive at the closing credits, while one expected survivor dies at the end."

","We went to see Van Helsing at the drive-in, as we felt this was the perfect venue for viewing such an epic. The costumes truly matched the period. The special effects were top-notch. The weapons and mechanical contrivances seemed well-suited to the tasks at hand. The story was another example of Stephen Sommer's penchant for combining genres into a single cohesive unit. Everything, in fact, was working well until, roughly, the second half of the movie. It was at this point that we noticed an ""uncredited actor"" making a surprise cameo appearance, and stealing multiple scenes thereafter. The first appearance was during the scene under the ruins of the windmill. The actors are conversing when suddenly, from above, we spotted THE BOOM MICROPHONE! It surprised us so much to think that a movie of this calibre (and all the money that was spent making it) would contain such a mistake! As it turns out, that was just the first of many appearances by the boom mic. Indoor scenes, Outdoor scenes- it got to be such a distraction that it became laughable. There were at least 10 such instances, and there might well have been more. These, in my opinion, took the movie from the status of ""great"" to ""hilarious"", which further endeared it to me- I began to see the instances as a tribute to ""old, bad horror movies"", an homage, if you will. I will have to see the movie in a regular theatre to see if this mics are as easily evident on an indoor screen.

","I knew what to expect going into this film and I could still barely stand to watch it.  They should have spent some of the CG budget on a decent script.  The lack of any intelligent dialog or character development leads me to wonder if the producers of this film think that special effects are all that is needed to make a film these days.  Someone needs to put a stop to these mindless comic book/superhero movies.  I don't ask a lot from movies, just that they are somewhat entertaining or have some sort of emotional impact so that I can become interested in the characters.  This film offers neither.  The CG graphics/stunts are so unrealistic that no one could possible be scared of any of the bad guys (including Hugh and Kate in the movie).  In fact the good guys seem to be as strong as the bad guys in this movie, taking as much if not more physical abuse and coming out of it with barely a scratch.  The only dialog in the movie is a few one liners to try and make the audience laugh (is this supposed to be horror or comedy?). I could sit and pick this movie apart all day, but I won't waste your time and neither should you.  My advice is stop giving these CG movies the benefit of the doubt by watching them like I've been doing.  Maybe if we all stop going to see them, the studios will start making some improvements!!"

Hmmm... is it just me or does this worldview seem all too frighteningly familiar? Stupid, disappointing, and nauseatingly bad writing and development.  I've never actually gone to the trouble of logging on to post a bad review of a movie before: This flick was uniquely inspiring in that regard.<br/><br/>I'd really like to see Hollywood stop shamelessly exploiting and wearing out well-known characters from famous works of the past (as in Van Helsing, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Underworld  etc.) to make stupid, big budget special-effects crap intended to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

","In the 1880's, Van Helsing is a James Bond-type for a secret wing of the Catholic Church. Instead of fighting SMERSH or SPECTRE, he fights the Universal back catalog of monsters (Mr Hyde, a Wolfman, and most notably Dracula, who has a Bond bad-guy idea for destroying the world).<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely beautiful to look at -- the production design is a pitch-perfect evocation of Hollywood horror movies from the Thirties and Forties, but grander -- it deserves an Academy Award nomination. The movie has been lambasted in some quarters for an over-reliance on CGI special effects, but I thought they were fun to watch, for the most part -- although the Mr Hyde is too close to the Frankenstein for comfort. The action sequences (and there are plenty) are fun to watch, too, although the final battle is disappointing:  here the critics are right, Sommers over-relies on CGI effects and quick cuts and it vitiates any sense of excitement we should be feeling.<br/><br/>The movie *should* be criticized for an absolutely terrible script. Nobody should go into VAN HELSING expecting WAR AND PEACE, but this doesn't even meet minimum standards of quality. Dracula's evil plot is not very well explained, and I don't understand how various other characters should be fit into it. Motivations of the other characters are all over the board or inexplicable, even with painful-to-watch scenes of characters looking off into the distance and explaining them. I also could have done without scenes where characters explain the background to each other for the viewer's benefit; without silly, too anachronistic to be believed dialog (at one point VH tells somebody he does what he does for ""self-realization""); and without the obligatory hip/""cocky"" rejoinders that just fell flat.<br/><br/>
It also *should* be criticized for some pretty bad acting. Again, my standards for this kind of movie are not high, but Sommers can't even seem to meet the low bar. Jackman can be good but he's not good here -- he seems painfully wooden, like he could never figure out what tone to take. David Wenham, as The Comic Relief, is spectacularily unfunny, and Richard Roxburgh, as Dracula, is achingly bad, maybe the worst portrayal of this character I've ever seen. Only Beckinsale is good -- she has the necessary light touch for this kind of semi-schlock. I spent a lot of the movie wishing that her and Jackman had switched roles.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this -- I like Jackman and Van Helsing was always my favorite character in DRACULA.

And with Van Helsings first appearance, fighting the obnoxious giant Scotsman Mr Hyde, there is also a bit of hope for the movie.<br/><br/>But as the movie goes on it just gets silly. Carl, the friar, has a ridiculously annoying English accent and is a blatent rip off of the Q character from the Bond Films. The storyline is done in the best possible way to fit Dracula, Frankensteins monster and werewolves into it, but it's not great and very predictable. I actually thought the monsters were all done pretty well, especially the werewolves which were very cool despite looking cartoony. The Frankenstein monster drew lots of laughs from the crowd, even though he was meant to be a tragic character. This was kind of unavoidable but they could have done him in a bit less obviously laughable way. And Dracula I thought was fine. There was alot of bad overacting from him and his brides but overall I thought he was cool. Even his demon form, which I thought I would hate, was pretty cool in the end.<br/><br/>Despite the fantastic effects, theres just too many negative points to call it a good film. A cheesy, predictable plot, poor acting, ridiculous lines, way too many unintentionally laughable moments and ridiculously over the top set pieces.<br/><br/>4/10 - just because of the overall look of the film and a few little things which were seriously cool"

","If you like frantic action and some really spectacular movie-making from a special effects point of view, see Van Helsing in the theatre and don't wait for it to come out on DVD -- it's too big for the small screen. However, if you like your action spiced with a good story and compelling characters, and you are bothered by glaring inconsistencies, see something else. The story is just barebones and dry -- go kill Dracula. The characters are all cookie cutter, with almost nothing at all original or compelling. Even Van Helsing's own story is hinted at but is left for the viewer to wonder, but is NEVER resolved (I hate that).There is an unexplained three-week skip in the storyline; how else do you account for there being two full moons separated by only two apparent days? (they handled a time transition very badly). Why is lycanthropy interrupted by clouds, but apparently a curtain won't work? How does the ""machine crossbow"" supposedly work, with no chemical or explosive reaction to drive the arrows out -- since crossbow works by the pent up energy of the bending of the prods, which NEVER MOVE (must be magic, because there's no other explanation). There are a couple semi-original ideas and a lot of unfulfilled possibilities with characters -- and the fact that not a single one of these ever comes to fruition just makes it more frustrating. As my husband put it, ""too bad such great action was wrapped around such a crappy story""."

As a movie, it's not bad...just cartoonish.  Nothing wrong with that... .  I would like to have had a better explanation about Van Helsing's past (and since when is Van Helsing Gabriel? It's always and forever been Abraham, and he's always been a doctor.)  I got the feeling that someone had played the video game Gabriel Knight and liked the name.  There was lots of humour in this movie and it really made it lots better than it would have had it all been played straight.  A friend complained that Kate Beckinsdale's character was parading around in suede thigh high boots with knock-me-down heels.  Well shoot....look at the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen....sort of a Doc Savage feel about it....mixing 1800's, 1900's and the future.... It's just a movie...enjoy it.

","Van Helsing was one of the biggest blockbusters in the 2004. A very dark film, featuring vampires werewolves, monsters and other creatures from the European literature and mythology. I was disapointed by this film. The settings looked completly aritfitial, the monsters looked totally fake, the make up and the cinematography  where very good, Hugh's performance sucked and this is actually evidenced of his lack of talent. Kate was better, but still her performance was very bad. But the main flaw of this film is the bloody script.  Dracula is probably one of the riches myths, and novels from Europe, filled with symbolism, and mainly is about an ""anti-Christ"" that is immortal, and that he lives drinking blood. Filled with dark and religious symbolism is one of the best myths ever. Frankesnstain is contrast it a story, (By Mary Shelly) about playing god, about turning dead to live, about resurection (artifitial). Together those three stories make a lame , stupid film, with great visual effects, but stupid."

","WARNING, SPOILERS - Continue at your own discretion<br/><br/>What do you get when you take one part Vampire Hunter D, one part Young Frankenstein, a little Castlevaynia, sight-gags, CGI action sequences, and then hand it all over to the guy who pumped out The Mummy series?<br/><br/>Nothing terribly outstanding, actually.<br/><br/>That said, it's an entertaining movie with a few good jokes, a couple of decent scares (more like intense startles brought about by loud noise), fairly good action sequences, semi-hip and vaguely humorous dialogue, and a passion for people falling down (try counting the number of times you see people falling and or swinging in this film - you'll run out of fingers to count on in the first ten minutes).<br/><br/>The problem is that it's a summer blockbuster, which doesn't mean it's a throwaway, but it's not meant to be anything.  It's not someone's personal vision, which I think we can all understand and forgive, but even for a bit of entertainment, it's pretty shallow.  The plot (rather decent, considering) moves at a breakneck pace, but not in the good way.  Rather than being designed to keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense and have your knuckles white in anxiety, the film seems to offer an apologia for it's lack of substance by hurtling the film forward so as to keep the audience from looking too hard.<br/><br/>Another problem is that it tries to present the movie from too many different angles.  It attempts to pay tribute to the classic horror films and stories, and at the same time make a halfhearted attempt at Indiana Jones-esque comedy, while simultaneously trying to eche out a place in the overflowing world of action films.  The film seems almost confused as to which direction it's heading at any given time.  Kind of like The Mummy, but with less effort.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is a lack of sympathy for the characters.  I couldn't find it in me to feel anything for Van Helsing - an introspective, wry, ominous hero played by Jackman, a man who's fast becoming well known for playing just such a character.  Forget trying to equate this Van Helsing with the academic Van Helsing from Stoker's work.  It'll make your head hurt and possibly make your eyes cross from the effort.  You also have his token comic relief assistant, Carl (another category with almost limitless and unvarying examples) who actually does have a few good funny moments.  Then there's Count Dracula, a character I knew I wouldn't care about for one reason - there are more Dracula films running around in this world than there are grains of sand, and most of them are about as indistinguishable.<br/><br/>The only two characters I found myself interested in were those of Anna, played by the almost incapacitatingly gorgeous Kate Beckinsdale (she seems to have found a niche in flicks where vampires fight werewolves), and that of Igor played by Kevin O'Conner (any similarity between Igor and Beni from The Mummy is entirely...obvious?).  Still, and here comes the spoiler part, when Anna dies at the end of the film, it really didn't matter to me.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is pretty throw away, along with the characters they play.  Frankenstein's monster is in it.  Not really important.  We never really get why anything is going on or how it's happening.  Many plots are dealt with very briefly and then dropped.  Like Van Helsing's origins - presumably he's the angel Gabriel and he's been fighting for hundreds upon hundreds of years?  Who knows!?  They never even bother to entice you with the knowledge of the truth!<br/><br/>On a plus side, there's a guy in this flick who looks and acts so much like Riff Raff from Rocky Horror Picture Show that it's disturbing!  I kept waiting for the entire cast to break into the Time Warp!  And then I would've been angry.  Mostly disturbed.<br/><br/>In summation, take your chick to this film.  Otherwise just watch the trailer and realize that you've just seen the entire film.  Not a BAD film, but...well you know."

","I, apparently like many moviegoers this weekend, had high expectations of this film.  It took all of 25 minutes into `Van Helsing' before I knew that I had made a titanic mistake.  Horrible CG, atrocious dialogue, slightly better than amateurish acting, and a totally predictable plot made this the worst movie that I have seen in at least a year.<br/><br/>From the opening battle, though the ridiculous boxing match between good and evil near the end, the viewer is subjected to constant cartoon-like CG which made the monsters only slightly more realistic than a good Xbox game and far less frightening.  Even if I had been able to get around the action scenes-which seemed to always include someone falling from an absurd height, controlled by a series of impossible flipping maneuvers, and saved by a last minute grasp on a rope or a ledge-I could not forgive this film for ruining our classic monsters.  Dracula, by the way, was the least scary example of the character that has ever been seen.<br/><br/> For me, bad accents ruin a movie as quickly as anything else. Most of the action in this movie takes place in east Europe creating an obvious need for actors who sound, oh, eastern European.  Here too `Van Helsing' falls way short of the mark. Kate Beckinsale (Anna), though stunningly beautiful in her early 21st century black tights, caused my ears to ache whenever she spoke.  Though not accurate, it may have been less intrusive if the director had made her speak with her native English accent.  Dracula (Roxburgh) was simply unable to render anything remotely passable.  The rest of the characters were so thinly defined and poorly acted that one soon loses interest in them or what they are saying anyway.<br/><br/> Finally, though the story is illogically convoluted and poorly conceived, the viewer never wonders what's going to happen next since everything is given away before it happens.  About halfway through, the ending is spelled out right in front of the viewer and I still have no idea how so little story was stretched to two and a half hours.  My standard for a good story line is asking myself `Could I have written this?' If the answer is `Yes' the movie is a stinker....`Yes'<br/><br/>A generous 4/10."

Some scenes were more improbable than the Canucks chances of ever winning a Stanley Cup.  This movie seemed to have left over bits of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Hugh Jackman's role seemed almost exactly like his role of wolverine in X-men, complete with the nightmares about his hidden past and oh, the fact that he becomes a wolf too.  Is this a coincidence that this movie was filmed around the same time as X-2?  Maybe the scripts were accidentally mixed up while filming.<br/><br/>
On the good side of the movie, the action in it was definitely entertaining, and I thought that the CGI was very impressive.  If you are just looking for a movie that's entertaining, has good action scenes, some pretty girls (like Josie Maran), and will give you a couple laughs, than see this movie.

","The trailers had me practically drooling to see this film - look at the cast! But alas...<br/><br/>OK, it's supposed to be over-the-top... just not this much.<br/><br/>I laughed out loud when Kate Beckinsdale first appeared, in makeup that wouldn't look out of place in a modern nightclub, gel curls, black leather corset, black pants, and high-heeled boots that can probably be seen on many women who walk down fashionable city streets today. Not very 1870s-ish, IMHO...<br/><br/>The stunts in this film were, in a word, ridiculous. A stunt should not LOOK so much like a stunt, that it detracts from the scene. That, unfortunately, happens a lot in this film.<br/><br/>The violence is very cartoon-like. The way our heroes would be thrown at high velocity and slammed into rooftops, beams, solid stone walls, etc, and get up without so much as a broken nail, reminded me of Looney Tunes characters Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote (remember how the Coyote could be flattened under a steamroller, but get up with a couple of bandaids on, and be in perfect health for the next scene? It's like that, minus the bandaids).<br/><br/>Something else which made me laugh was a scene in which a horse-drawn wagon became detached from its horses, and crashed in a huge explosion as if its fuel tank had ruptured. I guess Transylvanian wood must've been some volatile stuff, back then.<br/><br/>The plot? Well, it was silly. They managed to get in just about every monster they could. But not giving us the alluded-to background between Dracula and Van Helsing, which so obviously screams, ""Prequel!"", irritated me and left me feeling ripped off.<br/><br/>The special effects were very good. The vampires flying around were a treat to watch, but the 'wolfman' behaved more like a mad ape than a wolf, swinging from beam to beam. Come to think of it, Mr Hyde did the same thing... the 1870s must've been a real swingin' time for monsters.<br/><br/>The cast made a noble effort with what they were given, but it was a shame to waste such a good cast this way.<br/><br/>I give this film 2 wristwatches - that's how many times I looked at my watch in the theatre.<br/><br/>And I'd give it 5 out of 10, only for the actors and special effects.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD - and then wait for it to become a weekly rental, so you get it even cheaper."

","After watching this movie, you'll ask yourself, 'did they even read the script?' 'Was he(Stephen Sommers) even awake when he wrote the script?' SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>The movie starts out in b & w. Personally, I don't think it really needs it, but ok, sure. It's basically telling Dr. Frankenstein death story. Anything that happens in the first ten minutes of a movie, if told, i don't consider to be a significant enough spoiler to ruin the movie for somebody.The windmill that it happens in was made to burn. The whole interior is decorated with stuff that will help it burn. They are also in places, that would be pretty dangerous. Well anyway, that's the end of that.<br/><br/>
Now, onto color. It starts out with, this was my first guess, one of Jack the Ripper's victims. Van Helsing investigates, and looks back at some big, huge, building. Ok, now I'm thinking, The Hunchback? Scene cuts to him up there, this entire scene contributes nothing, absolutely nothing, that I could tell, to the story. Once up there, you find out it's Mr. Hyde. Now, for the record, just about anything and everything in this movie is ripped from another one. Now, IMO, Mr. Hyde is just the opposite of the Hulk. He looks like he's there, but he doesn't look real. For Hulk, switch 'real' and 'there'. The scene that ensues is straight from any 007 movie. The people in this movie are also extremely slow, the monk/Q character has a device that is basically an artificial sun, he says he knows what it does, but not what it's for. It takes him till just before they really need it to figure out what it is for. For me, it took me negative two seconds to think, 'that can be used to kill Dracula, I don't see what the problem is.'<br/><br/>I'm going to skip a lot of the movie till right before Anna and Van Helsing meet Frankenstein's monster. Now, i had totally forgotten he was supposed to be in the movie and with the dialog before the meeting I thought that there was about 10-20 min left in the movie. About 20 min later, with no signs of ending anytime soon, i thought, 'What the sh!t, this crap isn't done yet? F*ckin A.' It isn't even close to ending. You have about another hour left. Once you have though 'Ok, now the only reason i'm staying in this movie is to see it get better,' walk out. It'll get exciting, somewhat, and more stupid, but not better.<br/><br/>Now for the major spoiler: For the plot twist, Anna dies, yeah. Then, if you think back and replay some of the things she's done in your mind, you realize that she could've took it. End of major Spoiler.<br/><br/>Now for the special effects. Awesome. Dracula looks a little clay-ish, in his vampire form. But again, like Mr. Hyde, he looks like he's there. They work best in the dark where they don't have to put in much detail. And the transformations look pretty good, except for Anna's brothers when he's on the wall, i was asking how in hell he could stay up there. Kate Beckinsale looks great in the movie by the way. But it's not enough to save it by the longest shot anybody could ever take.<br/><br/>Another thing, this movie is suppossed to be funny as comic releif. I counted five times i laughed. 2 of them i can remember. When Helsing asks Igor why he shouldn't kill him and when Anna says she'll cut off something. You'll get it. Oh, and His children look like Gremlins<br/><br/>3/10 (Special Effects-2; Kate-1)"

","Don't have a huge critique planned, but I think an opinion is in order. First, I really liked seeing this movie, Hugh Jackman is awesome and needs to do more action flicks. There was constant action and though predictable at times, it was funny at times, made you jump once or twice, and was kate beckinsale is a full blown bombshell. Second, the problem I can see that people would have with it is there are unnecessary scenes, like the ending, no spoiler here, but it was a little drawn out. However, to those people I ask what would you have done to make those spots better? I can't really think of much, and I was impressed enough by the rest of the movie to where the little sratches were barely noticable. A huge problem is people forget this is a movie, because I am so sick of hearing ""it's unrealistic"" or whatever. The point of a movie like this is you sorta check out at the door, and hold on for a ride.

The effects were very good although the movie relied on it too much but it still made Van Helsing a good movie. The female vampires were really scary by the way. The lines were also not very good because they mixed our time with the time in the movie. And also in near the end when the moon was blocked and Hugh Jackman turned back into a man Dracula didn't kill him or even run away like he was trying to do when Hugh was still a wolf, that part didn't make sense at all. Also didn't you notice that when Van Helsing was a wolf he was bigger than all the other ones, that also didn't make sense. Thats all I have to say, It was good but not really good, because it was actors versus the effects, and lets face it some of the actors didn't do too good but Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale compensated for that. That's why it is only good and not really good."

","The summer season is upon us again and that means it's time for the big Hollywood studios to churn out their overblown, lavishly produced and commonly underwhelming Blockbusters. The first one out of the bag is Van Helsing, and let me tell you, they don't come more overblown and underwhelming as this. I can honestly say that this was the second worst movie going experience of my life (the first one being Batman & Robin). In fact, I feel as though I need to purge myself of this experience and writing this short review will be the first step forward.<br/><br/>The story centers around monster hunter Van Helsing Played by Hugh Jackman who is sent on a mission to Transylvania by the vatican. He has orders to kill Count Dracula in order to stop him from wiping out the blood line of their Royal Family of which 2 still remain. However, while there he uncovers Dracula's plot to bring life to his 3 Bride's vampire offspring and to do that he needs Frankenstein's monster. What could have been a dark, gothic action adventure soon becomes a total mess.<br/><br/>The Director Stephen Sommers can't write to save his life. His characters are as deep a puddles and just as wet. His dialogue is laughable and he often resorts to pratfall humour that becomes extremely annoying. What is worse however, is his love affair with CGI. There's hardly a moment in this film where some unconvincing monster turns up trying to look scary. When will Sommers realise that CGI isn't scary? Very well, I understand that it's hard to make a big budget fantasy film today without resorting to using a computer, but surely there's a line that shouldn't be crossed. And If there is, then Sommers is well and truly over it. I thought he would have learned his lesson from the stupid looking Scorpion King at the end of The Mummy Returns but it seems not. Neglecting the story and focusing on the effects seems to be a constant in Sommers's films<br/><br/>The real actors aren't much better. Hugh Jackman does what he can but alas it's not enough. He doesn't help himself by putting on a wobbly accent either. One minute he sounds American, then stereotypically British then European. Don't get me wrong, I think Hugh Jackman is a great actor but I question whether he should be associated with another franchise in which he is the foundation on which it is built. All I can say is I hope he isn't the next Bond. Kate Beckensale is wooden (as usual) but when you look that beautiful who cares if you can act or not? Not Sommers apparently. I Wonder what made her think to do 2 horror/action pictures in a row, both of which contain vampires and werewolves? Richard Roxborough does some hammy impression of Bela Lugosi and comes off as the gayest Dracula ever. Frankenstein is the tragic misunderstood character and the wolfman is little more that an expensive cartoon.<br/><br/>The good things in this movie are few and far between. The costume designs are lavish and creative, the sets are beautifully gothic and the score is quite good too. While I was watching this film all I was thinking was ""look at how much hard work goes into making a turkey."" This good stuff though is overshadowed by Stephen Sommers's desire to drop his pants and crap all over these classic movie monsters.<br/><br/>By now I'm sure you've guessed that I didn't enjoy this film, and you'd be so right. I kept hoping that it would turn itself around halfway through and at least finish on a positive note but it didn't. The trouble with this film is that you just don't care about any of the human characters, but how can you when they're 2 dimensional?  There is a scene in Van Helsing where our so called heroes come across hundreds of huge egg sacks that look like huge sweaty scrotums dangling from the ceiling. This scene crystalized what I thought about this movie... What a load of bollocks!"

I've seen that movie 4x and haven't been able to identify him.<br/><br/>As for Van Helsing, I thought it was great!  I was a little disappointed that Kate Beckinsale wasn't as ""kick-ass"" as I had expected (cognate to Selene in Underworld), but every other facet of the movie delivered as much, if not more, than what I had hoped for.  I didn't exactly expect the script for VH to rival the profundity of, say, the script for Gladiator.  The quality of the script didn't damage the movie for me.  It was fairly decent - certainly admissible.  If you want Grecian catharsis, you shouldn't be looking to VH.<br/><br/>Script aside, the special effects in this movie are fantastic!  Mr. Hyde was my favorite.  The CG was great.  Yeah it reminded me a bit of the Hulk, (referencing jsjn1s comment) but the only resemblance being that he's big and muscular.  Despite that, Hyde CG creation was pretty dead on it's character.  Technically, it's the one of the best 3D animated characters out there.  It felt alive, had skin sliding over fat and muscle which deformed quite realistically with his movements. If you knew how 3D animation is created, you'd certaintly appreciate ILM's achievement."

Which goes without saying that I did not enjoy the last Mummy film.<br/><br/>As expected the film was filled with action and CGI characters. The meshing of the characters was uncoordinated. The little comic relief from David Wenham was drab and unoriginal. The acting, dialogue and plot were absolutely substandard.

What a shame!  After a brisk and reasonably witty opening, it all deteriorates into something that is simply short on ideas but all too dependent on CGI.

","I must start out by saying something about this movie; it is NOT for everyone. There are elements here that for some people will just not gel. What we have here is not a horror film, but an adventure movie with monsters, that said, there may be minor spoilers here.<br/><br/> It was really different from what I thought it was going to be. Originally I expected it to be a story about Van Helsing. THE Dr. Abraham Van Helsing of Bram Stoker's novel. Secondly I expected it to be a really dark horror movie. What I found was, it was more of an adventure/action movie with horror characters, this is because it's a Stephan Sommers film, the dude that did the Mummy films. In Van Helsing, essentially he took these horror characters/monsters and then created his own bigass story. Van Helsing really isn't the Van Helsing of the Dracula novel, but a monster hunter of a similar name (Gabriel Van Helsing, not a doctor). I think you really have to walk into that movie knowing this won't be a film that purely reflects any of the stories that inspired it. Such characters as Dr. Jekyll/Mr Hyde, Victor Frankenstein and his Monster, Igor, the wolfman, even Dracula and Van Helsing are almost recreated specifically for this film.<br/><br/> As I said, Van Helsing exists purely as a monster killing tool, he isn't a professor or anything like that, much as the other monsters exist in this movie for the purpose of him eradicating with them in some manner, mostly killing them with a variety of Blade-type weapons. It's a monster movie without being a horror movie. It's visually dark, yet maintains the light adventure nature of the Mummy films. This may or may not be a bad thing, depending on what you want to see. I think given what this film was going to be about, it all fit together surprisingly well. I mean, I was rather worried about how all these characters would all fit into a 2 hour movie without being ridiculous like the always s****y 'Street Fighter', and what I found was rather cohesive, and at the very least, entertaining. Of course this film would've worked perfectly had it solely been about Van Helsing and Dracula without the other monsters, and could've truly embraced the dark horror element, but went in the direction of the Mummy.<br/><br/>As far as casting goes, Hugh Jackman is easily the next badass of action films, and we even get some Wolverinesque moments. Kate Beckinsale rules as always, though her accent in the film, as most characters, isn't as convincing as it could be. Regardless of this, she not only kicks ass, but looks great doing it. Casting wise, the more interesting thing, for me anyway, is to see David Wenham playing a character so far removed from Faramir (Lord Of The Rings). He was quiet, shy, and even his posture felt small. His character was said to be about 5'7"", meanwhile he in real life is 5'11"" yet his posture and acting pulled it off completely. His character was also cowering behind Jackman for most of the movie so that might've had something to do with it. Another great turn in the casting was Kevin J. O'Connor (also from The Mummy) as Igor. Though visually unrecognizable, his voice and acting filtered through his make up and just put a big smile on my face. Without getting into the plot too much, I will say this; I enjoyed the portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster. Unlike what most movies have done, they showed him for what he was. He wasn't evil, he was just a monster. He didn't ask to be made, but yet he was. The debate over the right for him as an individual to exist is addressed quite nicely in the film. Van Helsing, a man who exists to destroy monsters even sees he is not evil even when Anna (Beckinsale) and Carl (Wenham) cannot.<br/><br/> Now, besides the fact that I REALLY wanted to be watching a badass horror movie and didn't get that, I did have other problems with the film. Namely, the insane use of CGI. I understand with a film in a setting like this, CGI is needed, that's great, I accept that. However, the unnecessary use of it really can kill a film. I love a CGI character as much as anyone else (go SmÃ©agol) but the extent to which it is used for nearly every creature in the film actually really annoyed me. The thing with using mad CGI is that you see so much of it in a frame that it no longer becomes movie magic, but just a lazy effect. Some films do it great, like the Lord Of The Rings films or X2 (go Nightcrawler sequence), and some films really can't master it in full, like The Hulk, or even the first Spiderman. The effects in this film essentially use the same style of the Mummy creatures, and transplant them onto vampires and werewolves, and Mr Hyde. Sure it's great I guess, but it starts to take away from the film after so much of it is used. Not to mention, the vampires got progressively predictable as the wanted to feed because their mouths kept extending much like the warrior mummies in The Mummy Returns.<br/><br/> I've always been impressed with great makeup and prosthetics and this film kinda bummed me out at the fact some great monsters were reduced complete CGI trash. While Frankenstein's Monster was pure makeup, the werewolf was all computer, and it bugged the Hell out of me. There was so much potential here, but it was wasted. I did enjoy the way Dracula and his Brides were represented in their pure vampire form though CGI, well, more the Brides, Dracula looked rather tacky at times, specifically in the end. But my favourite parts of the film only were about a minute, maybe, combined, but did make it interesting. No movie before that I've seen has attempted and succeeded in representing werewolf or vampire sight, this film does. The werewolf point of view shots are very animalistic, blurry and black and white, and really put you into its head. The vampire sight is something I've only read in books. As much as vampire movies try to illustrate how vampires see different, it has never been shown. Even the Anne Rice novels which go to great detail to describe this, weren't translated into the films based on them. This film does it and does it well.  We finally see what a vampire sees as it hunts in the dark. It's wonderful.<br/><br/> In any case, the film probably isn't for everyone. If you want to watch Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman beat the s**t out of almost every major monster in literature and classic film, and/or appreciate the work of Stephan Sommers, see it. If not.. well, chances are you'll leave less than impressed."

","If you like movies like Lord of The Rings, X2, Matrix, etc, especially a fan of Vampires, you'll definitely love this movie, I personally rate it 4.5/5, its CGI doesn't lose out to movies like X-men and Spiderman, and the plot has lotsa twists, the only few parts that's kinda is the clothes of the Vampires changes with their body.. =S, some parts are a little too fast that u cant catch the story, but overall, it's a reeeaaallyy great movie, the creatures are brilliant and Dracula's brides are really cool, I esp like de part when Kate Beckinsale says ""Next time when you kill people, don't talk so much""  2004 doesn't have many movies that makes people cant-wait-to-see it, unlike 2003's Matrix and LOTR, but this is definitely one of the best I've seen this year, and Hellboy, supposedly its 'nemesis', p-a-l-e-s in comparison"

"darkageofwythia","Null","0","0","7 May 2004"," Oh where oh where could that little plot be...
","Van Helsing was so bad that I'd rather do anything than watch the 45 minutes of it I watched before I got up and left the theater. This includes such painful endeavors as getting a root canal, driving a car into a tree at 60 MPH, and jumping off of Niagara Falls.<br/><br/>Yes, it was that bad. You see, there seems to be this new generation of movies that are based solely on CGI effects and seem to lack that important literary device they teach you in middle school called a PLOT. Van Helsing was a particularly fitting and awful example of this, reminding me of a flop called Battlefield Earth that came out several years ago.<br/><br/>
* Warning: Potential Spoilers (although I try to avoid them) *<br/><br/>The movie took me completely by surprise, as I thought the first three scenes of it were a preview. This was because there was no introductory text on the screen to indicate that this was the start of the movie. The movie opens with some townspeople trying to break into Dracula's Castle. We see Victor and Dracula and then somehow Frankenstein got involved in all of this (don't ask me how). The action and awful noise begins there. We are soon introduced to Dracula's three ""brides"" - although certainly good looking, whoever was playing them had worse acting skills than me, and I have terrible acting skills to say the least. At the end of the first scene as they are swirling around the burning tower in what is conveyed as a malicious manner they have big bright smiles on their faces, certainly out of context with the scene.<br/><br/>After that we are introduced to our (weak) hero Van Helsing, who destroys Jekyl??? Don't ask me how he got into this, but he was there. After that Van Helsing makes a very quick trip to the Vatican where is told he must kill Dracula, stocks up on supplies very quickly, and leaves. There are many strands left open here... including his partner. We are not even told the name of his partner! Not only that but something was alluded to with a snake and a ring, and we don't learn anything about that but are left hanging. After that is a confusing action scene with the female character in the story which is probably a future scene of some sort... and that is followed by two more action sequences complete with loud noise and CGI effects to boot, but no plot...<br/><br/>Where oh where could that little plot be? Where is the character development? Where is the emotion to rope the audience in? Where are the basic literary devices that have been used for centuries to make reading and filmgoing a pleasure? Where is the story?<br/><br/>This is not a story or a movie folks, this is candy for those of little mind and short attention span. If you have any sort of brain, or are under the impression that you have any sort of brain, then this movie is not for you. And if you saw this movie and actually liked it then go and see it again, and try to actually think about what you're seeing... I think you will understand everything that I have said."

It has some great things going for it....Jackman, cool music, Great CGI scenery, An awesome black and white opening sequence that really grabs you, and a lot of cool action.  Of course there are the problems that keep it from being great-cheesy dialouge, overuse of special effects, a way too campy Roxborough as Dracula, and a leading lady wearing way too much makeup and modern clothing to be believable (I am sorry Kate Beckinsale fans-she annoyed me in this.)  I would have liked more explanation behind Van Helsing's past and for a little less mindless action at points.   I also thought the movie was too long.  However I can see where parts of this movie might have been used to make up a really good cinematic experience, so it is kind of a shame to me that some of its potential was wasted.   I recommend people see this in the movies....you will not get the same reaction out of it on video, but I do not recommend it for people looking for a great meaningful movie.

","I am not a movie critic.  Critics get paid to say unkind things about movies or to pick it apart and dissect it until there is nothing remaining that remotely resembles the movie.  When I go to a movie I actually try to enjoy it, but I was disappointed with Van Helsing.<br/><br/>I love Jackman and Beckinsale because they made it tolerable and at times enjoyable.  I did not like the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay that I found to be too plagiaristic to get excited about; case in point, Mr Hyde.  The Hyde character was stolen directly from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and only served to introduce Van Helsing.  Many other elements were borrowed for this movie but I will not list them here, you will have to see the movie and count them for yourselves.<br/><br/>The screenplay was so similar to Moulin Rouge at some points I wondered when everyone was going to break out in song!  Writer, Director, Producer, Steven Sommers seemed to know what he wanted but was just unable to pull it off. I think Sommers talents are better suited to the small screen.<br/><br/>There were some intriguing and creative new ideas about the classic monsters we all grew up with and I applaud Sommers Creativity.

Kate B is hot, which is great eye candy when she's not trying to be killed by female vampires (Which I think almost happens like 6-7 times in the movie)<br/><br/>The development of the characters just doesn't exist. You supposedly are given a plot to what has happened, but just as it starts to maybe make sense, a werewolf or some vampires bust it open and you completely forgot what you were even thinking about. The true story itself never really even makes sense, near the end of the movie they try to place together clues that were given in order to form a story/tale but it happens so quick, and so sudden, that even the 2nd matrix ""architect"" scene made more sense... (and that was rough to beat!!)<br/><br/>Overall, if it's easy for you to shut off your brain (and put ear plugs in) you could probably enjoy a cgi loaded film with a bunch of vampires and werewolves bouncing off rooftops and attempting to eat and slay other people.

","I love action movies and summer blockbuster more than most people I know, but Van Helsing is absolutely awful. I don't expect Academy Award winning performances in a movie like this, but VH quite possibly has some of the worst acting in the history of cinema. The guy who plays Dracula should never be allowed to appear in film again and Dracula's brides are the most annoying characters I've seen in a movie in a long......well, ever! The movie is like a 2+ hour video game with more CGI than Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, Hulk and The Terminator combined. The action scenes are horribly redundant and the ending is cheesier than most chick flicks. I guess I should have expected a bad movie from the guy who gave us The Mummy Returns. I'm sure Van Helsing will probably do $40-50 million at the box office this weekend, but I can't wait to see the drop-off next weekend once word of mouth spreads about this pile of crap. Save your money and wait for something good like Troy of Spider-Man 2.........there's no way they can suck as bad as Van Helsing."

","Van Helsing gets 2 out of 4 stars.  Director Stephen Summers did an excellent job with a movie that strongly resembles his two other Universal Studios blockbusters, The Mummy and The Mummy Returns.  It's weak CGI graphics will dissapoint viewers that want to see the ""effects of the year"". The Wolfman and Vampire effects are not very realistic, quite like the The Rock looked as the Scorpion King in The Mummy returns, only a little better.<br/><br/>Director Summers did a good job of making the love story a part of what could have been another summer action flick.  And the first 10 minutes of the film bring you back to the old Universal horror films like Dracula and Frankenstein.  Hugh Jackman is not at his best, the part lacks a character to be developed, but does a good job as always.  He seems to be able to make even the most lackluster character turn out fine. Kate Beckinsale does a great job and even has the gypsy accent to go with it.  She is as beautiful as always. The supporting cast also does a superb job of playing their parts even though the script lacks character development until the last 20 minutes of the film when we discover Van Helsing's past.<br/><br/>The film is a fun film to see in the theater but isn't a buyer when it hits the stores on DVD.  Universal will definetly get their dollars worth out of it, but is it really worth a sequal?"

Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest.<br/><br/>The only thing worse than than a boring action movie, is sitting next to a group of restless teenagers watching a boring action movie. Sure, it's no one in particular's fault that the teens were expecting every minute of this film to be as action-packed as the Burly Brawl, but that is of little consequence to you while you witness them grumbling and fumbling with their illuminated cell phones in your peripheral vision. Fun times.<br/><br/>The action this film does contain is...rudimentary and yet overdone at the same time. Each action scene goes on for what seems like ten minutes. This is not a big problem except that at about the 90-second mark all the action seemed to be repeating itself. At one point one of our heroes spits out a sentiment to a bad guy that I first heard more than two decades ago in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY and have heard repeated in a half dozen films since (including DIE HARD): ""If you are going to kill someone, kill them. Don't talk."" Agreed. Every bad guy in VAN HELSING should have learned that lesson years before this film took place. Instead we're treated with scene after scene of villains slowly stalking our heroes while delivering menacing monologues so lengthy they would have left Rush Limbaugh breathless.<br/><br/>The plot is thin, even with everything the screenwriter tried to cram into it:  there's every movie monster of the 20th century except Hannibal Lecter and Godzilla, a romance that condenses out of nothingness, a centuries-old feud, the secret crime-fighting society (complete with hidden HQ and James Bond's Q-like inventors), Dracula's horde of winged babies, the no-nonsense hero with trusty comical sidekick, the beautiful heroine who always needs saving, a duplicitous gravedigger (""It's what I do""), a monster-with-a-heart-of-gold, a quartet of bumbling evil henchmen. If you watch carefully in the second half of the film you will see the kitchen sink.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman showed flashes of greatness in the X-men films. Here he is mostly flat. The aforementioned Beckinsale is atrocious. Between the horrible accent she affects and the historically inaccurate Madonna-esque pseudo-S&M corseted catsuit, she is about as believable in her role as Roseanne Barr would be (I thought women of that era were supposed to be chunkier anyway). The rest of the actors were decent enough spewing out their rote lines.<br/><br/>Go see VAN HELSING. Or else you won't know what's going on in the sequel."

The CGI was terrible.  It was grossly overdone, and just looked fake. The movie would have been better if it hadn't relied so heavily on special effects.

One thing many people don't  recognize is the spoofs throughout the film.

The little comedic moments occurred far too frequently and seemed forced. The frankenstein monster was more reminiscent of Young Frankenstein than of the monster of the classic sense.

","The quick answer is yes, it IS all that.<br/><br/>I was so tired from work I nearly fell asleep, but not because it was boring... I was just tired.  Make no mistake, this is a 4 star classic as far as animated live-action movies go. They went for great screen classic. In fact... and I do not mean this sarcastically, one gets the feeling they wrote up their all-time list of favorite film scenes on 3x5 cards and then re-wrote these scenes and wove them into the story. Clicked on Final Draft's Vampire template and whacked their story into shape.<br/><br/>While that aspect felt a little contrived, they pull it off, so if you like CG you're in for a great ride.<br/><br/>Watch for the very well-executed homage to classic horror genre in the opening sequence, and then keep score of the nods to such films like as Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Ghost, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Fifth Element, LOTR, The Matrix, Aliens, James Bond, Alice in Wonderland, Batman, Spider-man, Crouching Tiger/Hidden Wires, the Hulk -- elements of all these films abound. Hulk because we think ILM used the same root level CG figures for some of the Van Helsing characters... that unmistakably squat froglike quality that digital Hulk had? No question, they used the same engine to drive Dr. Jeckyll and the Wolfman.<br/><br/>There were also some wonderful drones that reminded me of steam age jawas. Or perhaps more like steam age ugnaughts. Kate B. kept making me think of a low-budget Catherine Zeta Jones, and Dracula's brides reminded me of Glinda the Good Witch's appearances also in Oz. Everything was like something, come to think of it... but it was vibrant and lush, only the cheezy end sequence was cheap. Some very good LITTLE touches.  The critics are probably going to be tough, but I bet it's gonna do boffo b.o. - I envision teenaged girls weeping at the sappy tacked on ending, and OMG the video game is gonna be very fun - especially from the dracula's bride character vantage - night vision mode where you can see the blood pumping in people's veins.

"TheMovieMark","Null","0","0","6 May 2004"," What you get depends on what you expect
","I'm going to warn you right now: what you get out of ""Van Helsing"" completely depends on what you're expecting. I enjoyed the movie, but I really wish it had been a little bit more serious than it was. I was hoping for something along the lines of ""Underworld"" with more special effects, but ""Van Helsing"" is somewhere between ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" and ""The Mummy Returns."" Let me clarify: it's better than LXG, but it has sort of the same cartoonish feel.<br/><br/>But the movie has so much going for it that it's hard not to be entertained. You've got a good-looking cast, good-looking scenery, good-looking effects, and a GREAT atmosphere. Women will love Hugh Jackman (I know Stephanie did) and his shirtless self, and the guys (unless you're Richard Simmons) will love Kate Beckinsale (I know I did). Kate and her tight pants presence automatically add two ""targets"" to my rating.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, there is definitely some cheesy and goofy stuff in the movie that'll make you shake your head. For example, the fake Transylvanian accents really don't help the movie. Why couldn't they have just let Kate talk in her cute little British accent? And Dracula sounds like a mix of Count Chocula and The Count from ""Sesame Street."" I kept expecting him to say, ""Ah-ah-ah. One vampire bride! Ah twoooo vampire brides! Threeeeee vampire brides! Ah-ah-ah."" Where were Booberry and Frankenberry??? Sadly, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula is what hurts the movie most. He isn't menacing at all. If I stumbled upon his lair my biggest danger would be dying from laughter after he started flipping his ponytail around and talking in his silly accent.<br/><br/>Steph (my better half): Yeah, but the movie has Hugh Jackman, and you know, he's kind of hot.<br/><br/>I'm sure many girls will agree with you, Stephanie, but some moviegoers are looking for more substance than how good someone in the cast looks.<br/><br/>Mr. Shade (my friend): Well, Johnny, there's Kate Beckinsale, and you know, she's kind of hot.<br/><br/>BOOOYEAH! You got that right, Mr. Shade! HIGH FIVE! *looks around* Oh yeah, I don't do high fives. Um, anyway...<br/><br/>Some of the CGI is great. Mr. Hyde looks much better than LXG's version. He's the best bad guy in the movie, showing lots of personality. And I liked the werewolf transformations. But some of the CGI doesn't work so well. For example, there's one scene where a team of horses jumps a broken bridge ... ouch. The only way they could've made it look faker is if Joan Rivers was driving the team.<br/><br/>But if you can laugh it off, make fun of it, and enjoy the next round of Van Helsing kicking Monster buttocks then you'll enjoy it. This movie is a loud, fast-paced, action-packed ball of cotton candy. We're talking all-out monster mayhem here. It's a non-stop bombardment of special effects and CGI, and Stephen Sommers' was obviously intent on overpowering us with imagery, so if that sort of thing bothers you then ""Van Helsing"" might not be the movie for you.<br/><br/>There's also a little humor thrown into the proceedings, most of it coming from Friar Carl (David Wendham) and his less-than-courageous persona. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. Near the end of the movie Mr. Shade turned to me and said that he was hoping Van Helsing, who is fighting monsters in the name of God, would tell one of the baddies, ""I'm gonna hit you with so many left hands of God that you'll be begging for a right hand of God."" That little Chuck Norris tribute would've absolutely ruled. I'm pretty sure most of the audience would've groaned, but I would have laughed heartily.<br/><br/>
THE GIST<br/><br/>""Van Helsing"" isn't all I was hoping it would be, but I quickly accepted that and enjoyed it for what it is - an adrenaline-fueled, CGI monster ride with lots and lots of eye candy. Critics will hate it, and if you're looking for a serious exposition regarding the complex vampire/werewolf world (ala ""Underworld"") then guess what, you ain't gettin' it. But if you like your summer blockbuster to be a roller coaster ride with lots of unbelievable, in-your-face action and you can laugh off the silly stuff, then you can have fun with ""Van Helsing."" I did.<br/><br/>Steph: Yeah, plus there's Hugh Jackman, and you know, he's kind of hot.<br/><br/>Mr. Shade: Kate Beckinsale too!"

","Stephen Sommers should be found guilty of destroying, corrupting and ruining the most beloved movie monsters to walk across the screen.  My questions is how can somebody, who is educated, experienced in directing and writing, given a great cast and crew, completely destroy great fictional characters and absoulutly fail to tell a story.<br/><br/>The only saving graces of the film (if it can be so called) it the great talent that the cast had to shove into thier roles.  And while I admit, the scenery looks good, the story will have you shaking your head.

"cici-inator","7","0","0","7 May 2004"," mindless, entertaining romp...
","...those are the first words which spring automatically to mind when asked to review 'Van Helsing'. I had been anticipating this movie for little over two months, after I found out Sommers had casted Kate Beckinsale. Without her, I probably wouldn't have been so psyched up about it.<br/><br/>
I saw it last night on preview and lemme say first off, I don't give a toss what the critics think - or those who continue to diss the movie before even seeing it. I, personally, went for Kate and for what I got of her, it left me with a tingling, warm fuzzy sensation. I thought the whole movie, overall was fun. that's what I went for. Mindless fun. Some entertainment on a Thursday night. LXG this movie was not. And thank god.<br/><br/>So basic overview of the plot - Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man set out to rid the world of evil do-ers. He becomes the most wanted man in Europe after killing Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde in his opening scenes in Paris. Then he is sent on a mission to Romania to help the Valerious family defeat the legendary count, Dracula (an unimpressive Richard Roxborough). All the Valerious clan has been killed and it's two remaining descendents are Velkan (Will Kemp) and his sister, Princess Anna (Kate Beckinsale). Working together, they set about to eliminate Dracula and his three vampire brides in a bid to help each desceased member of the Valerious family get into the gates of heaven.<br/><br/>The sets and scenery were fantastic, really impressive. Likewise are the Wolfman transformations. Will Kemp is absolutely goregous; definately a rising star. The Friar character is essentially, the movie's only form of humor - which was lacking a bit. Even when Van Helsing tried to employ his own humor, it kinda backfired...quite a number of the audience laughed at the Friar's lines/un-intended puns and jokes - and we had a full audience.<br/><br/>Casting wise; I don't think Roxbourgh cuts it as the legendary foe. I fear this man will become a typecast for bad guys; i) the duke in 'Moulin Rouge' and ii) the bad guy in last year's truely rotten 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'... Likewise with the three vampire brides - I found them to be irritiating. Whenever they laughed, it was like screeching. And that sound in the cinema is NOT a good thing. The bride effects, when they were in the air and flying around and whatnot were, for me, a real let down. Unlike the wolfman effects, they were unconvincing. I found that with Stephen Sommers' last movie, 'The Mummy Returns'. The brides are Van Helsing's equivalent of the Scorpion King beast. Sommers, at times, relies on too much CGI and it, suffice to say, kills his movies.<br/><br/>I much preferred the aforementioned Wolfman scenes and the make up on Frankenstein's monster. One thing that really irked me - Kevin O'Conner, who plays the very hunchback-y Igor. You may remember him as Benny, the little weed in 'The Mummy' - he esentially has no part.<br/><br/>As for Jackman - I love him, a lot, but I hope he sticks with Wolverine as his stand out performance. I didn't really form an opinion on him as the male lead, but he has so much charm and charisma - who cares how he acted on the screen?<br/><br/>I loved Anna to bits. I think after the Friar, she was my favourite character. Simply because of who is playing her: Kate Beckinsale. First off, I loved the accent...some reviewer said she sounded too much like some character in the 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' cartoon - having never seen that, I can't compare. It was campy but I loved it. I found myself smiling at every scene she was in...chuckling to myself with the accent - she does it so well. Never falters once.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the majority of thespians struggle with accents other than their own. Prime example being Colin Farrell in 'American Outlaws'...his Irish keeps drifting in when he talks and hey, wasn't Jesse James an american? Rachel Weisz has that similiar problem [though not quite as bad as Farrell's]. While I love Beckinsale's fellow English compatriot; she doesn't do so well with American...Beckinsale does the transylvanian/romanian accent very well. Likewise when she portrays an American in her other movies.<br/><br/>In a nut shell - Beckinsale shimmers. She sizzles. She dazzles. She sparkles. She's glowing. All that good stuff. I found it quite entertaining that three or four guys, who were seated in front of me, kept going on about how hot she was. When she has her first scene in the movie, one of them turned to his friend and just uttered a single ""f*cking hell""...you can imagine what that was aimed at...For me, a defining scene is definately the masquerade ball - that's all I'm saying. Loved the close relationship Anna has with Velkan. I felt a little sorry for the character in some scenes - there are times where she really gets beaten about. Falling over things, falling through things - i felt Sommers was almost taking the mick out of a very intelligent Beckinsale; making the character seem clumsy. But hey, Beckinsale all sweaty and punched out is quite a turn on.<br/><br/>Final thoughts; go see this movie if you want. Don't let the critics get you downhearted. Form your own opinion on it - I did.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of ***** (Maybe pushing it for four stars; solely on the grounds of a dazzling Beckinsale)"

","I've put a rating of 3/10 for this movie. Maybe some of you know that I'm very critical, and this movie did not avoid my critizism. Basically, the movie looks nice graphically speaking, and the special effects live up to Sommers expectations, but stunts are repeated over and over again. We are not in Tarzan and yet Van Helsing strangely ressembles Tarzan, dudes just keep hanging on stuff, and moving from wire to wire, this is very annoying. The constant screaming of so-called Vampire wives is also a pain to the ears. <br/><br/>The plot is incredibly stupid, this movie is just useless, we would live well without it. Laws of physics are broken, i.e. the horse and chariot jump over the broken bridge, which is very highly unlikely. Horses are not that stupid, they would stop before kamikaze jumping into a pit.

","Hey, I've been reading all the comments that people have been leaving about this movie and I just don't get it, why does everyone hate it so much?  What were you expecting?  Akira Kurosawa's ""Ran""? Stephen Sommers mashes together all sorts of different ideas from the Hollywood blockbusters, westerns, modern horror, classic horror and splashes it all into one mayhemic mix.  He's like the Hollywood Blockbuster version of Tarantino (also a genius). Yes a lot of the time it's mindless entertainment but it is intelligent and well controlled mindless entertainment (Yeah i know that doesn't really make sense but just here me out).  <br/><br/>The film was a lot of the time very silly and very contrived, I'll give you that, but that was half the point.  There were some really clever moments. Like the line from ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly"" about talking before killing someone, the lines from Frankenstein ""It's alive, throw the switches, yes master!"" and the bit from ""Speed"" except with a carriage instead of a bus.  Sommers has a real knack for smashing together contemporary action (explosions, electricity, chases) with 19th Century stylised vision.  <br/><br/>The production design was just marvelous; the creepy and elaborate sets, the over the top monsters and the wonderful blue hue that he'd given the whole film.  There were some very clever camera techniques as well i.e. in some cases rather than cutting from one area of the set to another, he just made the camera zoom across vast distances at an incredible rate, it's inventive you've got to at least give him that.  <br/><br/>To be honest I think you should all give Stepehn Sommers a break, what you should have expected was stylised spectacle, special effects laden mayhem, plenty of action sequences and lots of comic moments, which he delivered with gusto and panache.  I think hats off to Stephen Sommers for attacking this film with a no holes barred attitude and pulling it off.  This was stylish, silly but inventive and quit frankly insane artistic flare.  Sorry, I had to have that little rant there.  <br/><br/>(Also hats off to Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxbourgh for giving wonderfully over the top performances, hats also off to Alan Silvestri for the groovy score, Allan Cameron for the production design and also to Bob Duscay for producing it and doing some top notch editing [also, Kelly Matsumoto] especially during the fight sequences.  Oh and obviously once again a huge ten galleon hat off to Stephen Sommers for just being an all round visionary maniac.)"

She started off so well in Pearl Harbor and He was so suave in Kate and Leopold and X-Men.  What happened? Apparently Hollywood does not learn from their past boo-boos.  Didn't they already try this story in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?  And didn't it suck?  A resounding YES!  Please, Hollywood, stop torturing America with these weak-plotted films, shallow-plastic characters and unrealistic cartoony action scenes.  My fiance and I found ourselves giving each other pathetic, nauseated glances every time another unbelievable escape scene finished with each character somehow trying to look sexy and unruffled added in with some cliche line.

Why are so many villagers in the village with their shovels, rakes (and implements of destruction), sickles, etc. and not out in the fields? Why can't a vampire that can pick up and hurl a cow, but when a second person jumps on the legs of the first person being picked up it's 'too heavy' and they let go. Holy water sure is potent! a few drops is enough to kill a vampire (hadn't been one kilt in a hunndered years!) Why does the basin exist? If I was Dracula, I wouldn't allow holy ground/church to exist. It just goes on and on like that. I must have missed how Van Helsing was alive after so many years, I never did see much to explain that. Why can a werewolf kill Dracula and noting else can? Why can a woman take multiple falls and poundings be killed by the only bit of comfy furniture in Drac's lab(?) I think it was a particularly vicious divan. The only redeeming element in the script was the idea of drac's children and the Frankenstein 'process' tied together. Hugh Jackman tries, but we don't get enough about his character.

Van Helsing has both, AND Frankensteins monster, so I have been eagerly awaiting this title. And last night was the world premiere, with Galla, monster outfits, push-up Vampirella outfits and so forth, what a JOY!!<br/><br/>*****Minor Spoilers below*********** Unfortunately the movie is very disappointing. The storyline has so many holes, it must have been bitten by a rabid vampire. The plot is pretty standard, with no surprises at all, leaving your guesses from the start of the movie, confirmed at the end.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning, you are told that the main character is several hundred years old, which makes him some kind of immortal. Hence, you never get to feel that he is in any kind of danger. You know what kills vampires, you know what kills werewolves, you don't know if there is anything that can kill Van Helsing. This is probably the biggest problem of the movie. IT NEVER GETS EXCITING OR THRILLING!! Add to that, Van Helsing is the James Bond of forgotten days, armed with an arsenal of ""futuristic"" weapons and devices which are always there to save the day.<br/><br/>Acting is good. Casting is decent.<br/><br/>The graphics are pretty OK.The backgrounds are great, leaving you submerged into a dark and creepy world. Most of the effects are decent, with a few glitches, and some poorly created CGI effects here and there.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is unobtrusive, creating a good atmosphere. Sound effects are for the most part decent, but not good enough to bring on extra ambiance.<br/><br/>I'll not recommend this movie to anyone. You might enjoy it on a lazy Sunday evening,  but do not expect anything exciting to happen.<br/><br/>Best Regards Robert Tofte<br/><br/>PS.: While I do not dislike that Van Helsing has been turned from an elderly wise and knowledgeable man, into an younger and more action oriented hero. I DO dislike that they can't pronounce his name correct. The ""V"" in Van Helsing is pronounced as the German ""V""(Fau), hence the name is pronounced Fan Helsing, but in the movie, everyone pronounces it as if it was an American name."

","What I like about this film is that the heroes perform their stunts...err...gracelessly.  Van Helsing attempts to overcome the flaw of many action films by adding an element of brute realism to the contemporary genre of unexplained superhuman gymnastics.  Heroes actually hit anything from trees, roof shingles, and cliffs during a fall - I think I would hit everything except air if I took a plunge!<br/><br/>Faithfully, this visually-rich film pays homage to early century horror classics, casting an icy shadow over each frame.  You may recognize the opening dialogue as an allusion to an earlier film.  Many interesting overhead shots patrol the industrial-aged cities of Paris, Rome, and Transylvania.  Inventions, potions, art, and folklore embody an environment that embraces a story of passionate motives with bits of comic relief.<br/><br/>A simple but interesting premise emerges from the opening sequences: a single-minded 19th century hitman is hired by the pope to purge the world of evil monsters.  Of course we know that from the previews.  However, Van Helsing is already subject to paradox in his mission to ""cleanse"" since the act of killing is unholy - and this throws the wrench in the whole gothic machine.<br/><br/>Remember, take each film for what it has to offer.  Films entertain in different ways.  Don't watch Scarface expecting to be touched by a valuable family lesson.  Don't watch Star Wars expecting to explore interpersonal relationships in a contemporary world.  Don't watch the Wizard of Oz expecting handguns and grenade launchers.  Don't watch Bruce Almighty expecting to find God as an old beady-eyed squinty cigar-smoking man with thick glasses (that's a different movie)."

","Well, this film really reminds me of the Star Wars movies. Why?<br/><br/>The main theme is the fight between good and evil, but otherwise there is no real plot. You´ll see lots of fights, explosions and chase scenes, but not much else. The film anti-climaxes every ten minutes, usually because of uninspired (over)acting or extremely ridiculous dialogue. The CGI is flawless - it´s actually way too flawless - in this setting it should have been more organic.<br/><br/>Oh, and the hero is totally unaware of his background, while the heroine is constantly dressed in sexy outfits, not particularly suited for fighting.<br/><br/>Both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are talented actors, but unfortunately the chemistry between them is lacking. Richard Roxburgh is miscast as Count Dracula and fails completely to bring sinister qualities to his role. Fortunately, David ""Faramir"" Wenham as ´Q´ provides comic relief and something for the Lord of the Rings fans. And Dracula´s brides are rather fine eye candy.<br/><br/>Maybe this is 2004´s first blockbuster, but it will not be the start of a new franchise. Too bad. But then again, at least that´s one thing it doesn´t have in common with Star Wars.<br/><br/>

When CGI is seemless like in LOTR or is like modern art like in Shrek or Finding Nemo, i have no problem with it.

","After viewing the trailer some months ago I thought this was going to be a good film.  I am completely aware of all the trash that the big studios produce nowadays... somehow I thought this would be different, but instead it turned into a boring film with obnoxious one-liners and too much CGI. <br/><br/>
Now, the actor that played Dracula just didn't fit.  Dracula is suppose to be a dark-powerful being and inspire fear and respect, as well as sex appeal.  Even with all the CGI this Dracula did none of the above.<br/><br/>
Dr. Jekill/Mr. Hyde also seemed to be extra, it could have been a deleted scene.<br/><br/>CGI is another factor that bothered me.  It's good to have special effects in films, but when it's overdone it looses the effect.  Whatever happened to the make-up department?   In the old days there were films that portrayed vampires, zombies or other evil entities simply with make-up effects; some looked fake and stupid, but others were truly terrifying.<br/><br/>I suggest to any serious film enthusiast to stay away from Van Helsing.  If you still want to watch it, do it only for fun.  Just don't expect too much."

","As an attentive friend of mine described it, this film is ""Dracula for the Harry Potter Generation"". A very apt description for a film apparently for those with short attention spans, as unfortunately much Hollywood fodder is today.<br/><br/>This is not so much a retelling of Bram Stoker's original story, but a new story by the director as told from Van Helsing's perspective, bearing little or no resemblence to the original. This is true not just of the plot, but of the nature and mood of the film. There are no signs of Coppola, Hertzog or Murnau here.<br/><br/>Count Dracula has found a new cave to call home. He wants babies, and astonishingly, he realises the only way he can have them is to get hold of Frankenstein's monster who somehow wondered onto the set of this film and use his body to conduct the required electricity to bring power to Draculas endless egg pods.<br/><br/>It's quite a ludicrous story, but that's ok. It was written and directed by Stephen Sommers who made the two Mummy films. His fair assessment is that we go to the cinema to have fun, and he takes us on a pretty crazy ride. There is action aplenty and wonderful CG effects to bring the hordes of hell to life. Unfortunately, the constant action and adventure comes at the cost of any real suspense or drama, which to some may not be a bad thing, but to me it is.<br/><br/>Unusually for such a big budget Hollywood film, three aussies star: Hugh Jackman (in an adequate but sadly unremarkable role), David Wenham (in a whacky turn that couldn't be further from his Father Damien in the excellent Molokai) and Richard Roxburgh as Dracula, who I couldn't help but think was hired because they couldn't get Gary Oldman.<br/><br/>I did love the title design on the end credits. There is also some awesome gothic imagery here that wasn't given enough room to breathe amongst the rush to keep things moving. Ultimately, this film serves it's purpose, as long as you know that that purpose is just a couple of hours of over-the-top fun and frolics."

Van Helsing has been ordered to capture or kill Mr. Hyde.  He finds Mr. Hyde and the battle is on.  His next mission is to go to Transylvania and kill the vampire, Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh).

Van Helsing joins forces with Anna to go after Dracula.  Anna's family has tried everything to kill Dracula for over 400 years.  Anna's entire family tree will go to hell if Dracula is not killed before she dies.  While Van Helsing is battling Dracula, he discovers his secret past.

To make it fair, Sommers has done the same with the monsters he battles (their lumbering counterparts from the 30's wouldn't have stood a chance).  Just like James Bond, Van Helsing roams internationally, fights evil, uses specially-designed gadgets from his techo-geek friend, and wins over the voluptuous love-interest, all at a breathless speed.  The film hardly pauses for some perfunctory back-story and character development, hurtling from one melee to the next.

"KillerCadugen","5","0","0","10 May 2004"," Soulless
","SPOILERS AHEAD - Although I left the theater feeling entertained, it was a hollow feeling. It got even hollower as I explained to my family (which, by and large, liked the movie) about the original myths of the vampires, werewolves, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and even Frankenstein. I don't understand how Stephen Sommers can sit there and say he is paying homage to the old classic Universal monsters when all he did was twist the myths to suit his movie. A Mr. Hyde that was far more monstrous that the original story intended? A vampire that can morph into some demonic being and be killed only by a werewolf? A vampire hunter that was nearly immortal? Vampires than can breed (come on!)? Although on the surface the movie is very entertaining, Van Helsing is a soulless, CGI-driven cartoon that should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the classic Universal monsters. Maybe Sommers could have sacrificed some of the CGI in order to develop the characters a little more - to maybe reveal a little of what Van Helsing's secret is, to learn a little more about the family being torn apart by Dracula. About the only thing Sommers seemed to do right is the Frankenstein monster, which was a lot closer to what Mary Shelley had depicted (except for the electrical circuits and whatnot in his head, which was a cool touch). You can have Van Helsing, give me Dracula with Bela Lugosi, Frankenstein with Boris Karloff, and The Wolf Man with Lon Chaney Jr anytime."

It wasn't very funny where it tried to be, it's continuity was terrible and if you love classic monsters you'll despise this. No longer are vampires part of God's great vengeance, it's all a personal feud between Romanian inbreds. Victor Frankenstein is no longer obsessed with the very nature of life, he's laboring to create a power up for the vampire boss, who has a Bond worthy plot to fill the world with demonic telletubbies, part green gummi bear, part Alien egg sack.<br/><br/>You'll also learn that you can run from Budapest to Transylvania and just barely be out of breath, which is good to know if a flavorless well groomed vampire is about to use an automaton as some sort of cable box to correctly charge his spawn.<br/><br/>I actually fell asleep for a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>If I was 14 and had never seen anything else in the way of horror or action movies, maybe it could get a pass, as it is I give it a 5/10, and that's with a bonus for a great angry mob."

The film rips of pretty much every film ever made, but it's done so openly that it somehow gets away with it.<br/><br/>Van Helsing really don't have a real script. The film is just a collage of actionsequences and scenes were the characters explains the plot to each other. There is really nothing for the actors to work with. That aside, there is no excuse for putting Kate Beckinsale in a film. She is a terrible, terrible actress. Yes, I know she is stunning, but she doesn't do anything but moan through the entire film. She is well on the way of becoming the female Ben Affleck, and that is not a compliment! The only character with a hint of charisma is Frankensteins monster.

"mjmeans","Null","0","0","5 May 2004"," ""Blockbuster"" or ""lackluster""
","I interviewed a lucky, or rather unlucky, viewer who happened to be chosen for the sneak preview of ""Van Helsing"". This special effects porn (see note below) might appeal to naive kids who have never heard of Mary Shelly, or Bram Stoker; but, it just goes to prove the point that ""a sucker is born every minute."" Let me explain.<br/><br/>Firstly, some might consider some of these statements to be spoilers of crucial (though misconceived) plot elements. Nevertheless, you are warned.<br/><br/>This travesty attempts to merge the various monster myths from antiquety; but, does so poorly a job at it that the ludicrous ""Clash of the Titans"" held truer to the base myths. Within the monster myths, ""Abbot & Costello versus [insert monster here]"" movies were closer to the mark.<br/><br/>Here are some paraphrases of the comments I heard:<br/><br/>A silver stake through the heart of one of the brides of dracula, and she puffs up in green goo and explodes when the others when pierced with the same stake crumbled to dust? Excuse me, a silver stake does not kill a vampire! The myth says that ""only something which once lived"" could be used as material for a stake. Also, where is the cutting off the head and burning it; which is also required to prevent the vampire from rising again?<br/><br/>Okay, no myth has ever had Van Helsing kill Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. hyde, or any werewolves, for that matter. The myth tells us that Van Helsing is a bookwork/geek type doctor that studdied the vampire myth for decades and gave advise. He is not a 30-something appearing immortal ""left hand of God"" who has lived hundreds of years. How does someone think this excrement up and expect to shove it down our thoats.<br/><br/>As for the werewolf myths, the transformation scene in ""American Werewolf in London"" is far more believable, though my source applauds the flexibility of the actor. Unconvincing special effects include Van Helsing-turned-werewolf grabbing two people by their necks and jumping 2 stories up! Then jumping down and landing with the peoples feet and his hitting the ground at once. Come on! A human neck would either fracture their larnyx, crack instantly, or be ripped off with that kind of lifting force. Even if they could have correctly filmed the scene with him grabbing them around the chest and under the arms, the jump down would have likely broken their legs. Sure the werewolf might have survived unscathed, but the humans would be toast.<br/><br/>The only good things I have to say is that the actors do an excellent job of acting. It is too bad they were saddled with such a contrived script. And the artistry in the ending credits is quite good, if you can manage to make it that far. Frakenstein's exclamation ""I want to live!"" might better be stated ""I want to leave!"".<br/><br/>Note: Special Effects Porn is a term that applies to a movie that appears to be wholly created for special effect extraveganzas with a contrived or thin plot (if you can even call it that) linking the special effects scenes in a similar fashion to the so called plots between sex scenes in porn movies."

While Hugh's character (Van Helsing) is the titular role, the meat of the show seems pretty evenly distributed so don't expect a Hugh Jackman showcase. Of course Richard Roxburgh is divinely camp as Dracula and it's great to see a different slant on the old story. While the purists will hate this I think it's heaps of fun (that 'f' word again!).<br/><br/>The effects and cinematography are simply gorgeous, from a wolfman's eyes in the bushes to the flying bat-like creatures that are the ""brides"", there is nothing that will bore even the most jaded cinema-goers (yes even the spoiled 15yo's will like this one!). The scene with a wolfman howling at the moon as he changes back into a human is pure art. Gorgeous stuff ... pish-posh to all the ""no cg""-sayers.

","Borrowing from a wide-spectrum of films, including James Bond, Rambo, Bugs Bunny, comedies and classic horror, Van Helsing is a film that does not bring the viewer IN.  You are never engaged.  Instead, you are disengaged by a goofy and thin storyline, almost never-ending noise and gratuitous special effects and ridiculous action scenes that are more filler than story progression.  Van Helsing is less film and more lengthy promotion for a future 'thrill' ride at one of Universal's parks.  As a ride, Van Helsing would be fun -- not scarey, not eerie, just an entertaining few minutes of fun.  As a film, it is very cartoonish, sometimes boring, often repetitive -- and a huge disappointment.  Or is it?  To be disappointed, one has to have certain expectations.  If you are aware that the director (Stephen Sommers) of Van Helsing also directed the recent films The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, your expectations were probably not that lofty.  If you loved those movies, and many did($800 million plus worldwide), you will be thrilled with Van Helsing.  If you thought those films relied too heavily on special effects and not enough on story or character development, you will see the same flaws in Van Helsing.  If you are a fan of the vintage horror films of the 30's and 40's, you will see glimpses of some outstanding visuals that harken to the images of those films.  And, you will see many of the famous monsters of those films, including Frankenstein's creation, Dracula and the Wolfman.  However, you will see only fleeting glimpses of what could have been a return to classic horror -- with the benefit of a huge budget (estimated to be in the $150 million dollar range).  Van Helsing is devoid of the creepy and eerie spirit of the vintage films and the frights of more recent offerings.  Special effects are the primary focus of Van Helsing and, as such, turn the film in to a lavish cartoon/video game, with no depth and not even any real thrills.  Even the aforementioned monsters are disappointing, with the Frankenstein monster looking pretty plump (he garnered laughs at the screening I saw), Dracula hamming it up and the Wolfman, looking less like a wolf-MAN, and more like an artist's rendering -- which is appropriate since he exhibits the ability to survive tremendous falls much like Wyle E. Coyote.  Unless you are a fan of loooong cartoons, Van Helsing, at more than two hours, will bore you more than entertain you and leave you wishing that the filmmakers had dug deeper -- not in to their pockets -- but, in to their imaginations to create a film that would have at least creeped us out and at best gave us some jolts."

","Van Helsing is a beautifully looking film, with great action sequences that certainly entertained me for a while. I can recommend it to anyone who wants a fun night at the movies. Whoever, it is not a good movie. The plot is illogical and full of twists to make the movie last a little longer. The dialoges are incredibly stupid and cheesy, and so is the acting. Especially Richard Roxburgh is hilariously overacting as Dracula. All the cliche characters are here. There's the James Bond like hero (Van Helsing), his sidekick that's supposed to bring the comic relief (ironically, he was the only character that wasn't funny in this entire movie), the sexy, bitchy heroin, the charismatic bad guy, the ugly, stupid bad guy-sidekick, the dumb locals, the scary monster that only means good...<br/><br/>So, if you're in for a night of brainless fun with cheesy overacting by every single actor in the cast, spectaculair action and probably the stupidest dialogues of the year, Van Helsing is your flick."
"katiepoppycat","Null","0","0","10 May 2004"," predictably brilliant
","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>It's groaning with cliches, there's way too much CGI, rotten accents, hammy acting, excessively dramatic moments, it has good goodies, bad baddies, slightly bad goodies and bumbling goodies, ludicrous plot devices and is oh so predictable - in short, bloody brilliant.<br/><br/>If you liked the Mummy, then you will love Van Helsing.  It's nicely filmed, the opening scenes in black and white are a nice touch.  From then on in, the mock gothic horror feel is well maintained, much as the ancient egyptian atmosphere worked so well in the Mummy.  It's not worth going into the plot - hell, Sommers didn't bother!  Suffice to say, there's lots of CGI ass kicking, and of course, the girl needs rescuing a couple of times.  One criticism is that Sommers spent too much time setting up Van Helsing's mysterious past without ever resolving any of it.  It's just a little too obvious that he's saving it all up for a sequel.<br/><br/>I felt the film was, in places, a little too reliant on CGI.  I would have preferred to see Van Helsing and Dracula go head to head, rather than their monstrous incarnations.  And if Stan Lee doesn't sue, I'll be amazed, because Dracula was blatantly Bloodscream.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, Richard Roxburgh was deliciously camp as Dracula, his brides hilariously silly.  Kate Beckinsale feisty and offering the most entertaining Romanian accent since Tim Curry in Congo.  Hugh Jackman brought Wolverine out of the bag again, although instead of claws he had whirling blades that slid out of his sleeves.  Cool.  By far and away the best performance came from David Wenham, as Karl, the bumbling friar/Q stereotype.  He had all the best lines, and just stole every scene he appeared in.  My personal favourite was when he walked into the hall after a big werewolf incident and mildly enquired 'why does it smell of wet dog in here?'<br/><br/>To summarise then, cheesy, silly farcical fun, and i can't wait for the next one.  As long as Sommers promises not to insert an annoying kid."

Its obvious this movie was only meant for the arty crowd, such as myself, and because of this it probably wont get much mainstream attention. The fight scenes are few and far between and its obvious the directer wanted to get his point across using as little dialogue as possible, its really the sort of film were you need to fill in the gaps.

"sports-8","Null","0","0","5 May 2004"," Universal's goes back to its future with ""Van Helsing""
","In today's movie market, I suppose one should be happy with a film that simply entertains you for a couple of hours. Doing too much beyond that, such as enlightening or inspiring may be best left to Cecil B. DeMille or Mel Gibson. That being said, there is a bit of good fun still left, the kind that doesn't nourish, but sure tastes good going down, leaving us fat and happy for a time. Recent films which fit that category, in my opinion, at least, were ""Butterfly Effect,"" ""The Ladykillers"" and ""The Alamo."" No another picture has come along to place itself safely in that category, Universal's horror/action thriller, ""Van Helsing,"" starring the game Hugh Jackman, in the title role, shedding his his sharp-clawed Wolverine motif (for a while, anyway) to play the famous vampire/monster killer. Filmed with as much derring-do as any Indiana Jones episode (although Harrison Ford's fedora is a bit to big for Jackman right now), Van Helsing's two hours fills the entertainment bill quite nicely and, despite a few CGI glitches, comes across as a decent film for its genre. There's a reason for this, though. Director Stephen Sommers is credited with the screenplays of  ""The Scorpion King,"" ""The Mummy"" and its sequel, ""Return of the..."" The bombastic sounds emanating from these productions, as well as the dark, brooding atmosphere and a somewhat literal sense of history and fantasy, as well as nice homages to the old classic Universal horror flicks of the 1930s, the original ""Mummy,"" ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Wolf Man,"" make this an interesting, if not all too sophisticated experience. After disposing of Mr. Hyde (and unfortunately Dr. Jeykle at the same time, a CGIed Hulk-like Stephen Fisher), in Paris in 1880, Van Helsing is sent by his Holy Roman Catholic overseerers to rid the world of County Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxberg, ""League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen""), the undead one who's causing such a ruckus in Transylvania. That should be simple enough, but Drac has a few friends helping out, including a ferocious werewolf (Will Kemp, when not computerized beyond all possible recognition), and a Peter Boyle-looking Frankenstein's monster who suddenly turns all mooshy on us. The Count also has a few evil wives that fly about grabbing various citizens of the Baltic country and generally doing their master's no good bidding. Needless to say there's plenty of killing, with green blobs of tiny vampires bursting apart everywhere. Fortunately, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, with an array of James Bond-type weaponry, such as a machine gun that rapidly fires arrows and special bombs that destroy only the undead (who are already dead to begin with...oh never mind). There's also a goofy friar, Karl (David Wehnam), who provides much of the comic relief. ""Van Helsing"" is rated 'PG-13,' and opened on Friday, May 7."

","I think that the hype for this movie has billed more as a horror than it truly is.  Truth be told it comes off as a cross between Adams Family Values and Underworld at best.  Many of the effects are interesting but not necessarily appropriate.  Some of them threw off the time period of the movie especially the Frankenstein `monster'.  Then there is also the fact that the costumes are never right for the time period but this one took the cake, especially when it came to the Masquerade Ball costume of the sidekick.  Then there is the drawing from a thousand other films.  The Brides of Dracula rather reminded me of harpies as portrayed in other films. This film is at best a film for renting and watching when you are sick and tired of watching Friends or Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Although I must say that I did see at a sneak preview and it was nice to not have to pay for it, even at the cheapest rental price.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that it doesn't have entertainment value but I guess I have become spoiled over the years.  If you can handle a vampire ridden, Mark of the Rose-ish Melodrama then you are good to go."

Frankenstein's monster becomes a good guy and Van Helsing wears Dracula's ring (no formal engagement, however). Holy water kills Dracula's brides but a werewolf has to bite Dracula to knock him off. Good acting by Hugh Jackman but Kate Beckinsale's acting was stilted and unconvincing. The special effects were reasonably good and the music was suitably creepy but much too loud. I had the foresight to bring ear plugs and wore them throughout the film. This film should appeal to the teen age crowd but won't play as well to adults."

","I must admit that I am sadly disappointed to see this film produced in the manner it was.  It appears to me that Hollywood is focusing more on FX than story these days.  This film had the curse of a weak storyline being supported by a cast of actors that couldn't help resurrect it any.  If you are a fan of the modern works of Hugh Jackman (X-Men and after) you will find his acting to be on par for this role.  However, the character he portrays is not one that is worthy of Jackman's overall talent.  It is sad for me to say the most realistic and heartfelt acting in this film is done by Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein's Monster).  The role of Dracula is not what one might come to expect for a true lover of vampire movies.  A poorly written script offset with weak comedy cannot save this film from its most certain demise.  Unfortunately, it will most likely settle well with the younger crowds and the FX of the film and it's PG-13 rating will allow the younger audience to carry it to the upper ranks in the box office. However, I wouldn't waste the time or money investing in this film as an evening of entertainment."

","Okay, this movie is no intelligent piece of cinema.  It's mindless entertainment, pure and simple.  The action sequences are okay, maybe a tad cliche.

At times, that goes so far some scenes even feel like a spoof.  There are some cringe-worthy moments, like the ending; and the vampires are sometimes so stupid that makes me wonder how they could have survived for so long... <br/><br/>
But for all its shortcomings, I thought the movie was great.  It's just so funny.  I laughed so much; I even applauded after one of Anna's lines near the end.  Plus, David Wenham's character Carl is absolutely hilarious; his 'Q spoofs' moments are just so totally precious.  For me, he stole the show. <br/><br/>I had a lot of fun watching the movie, and that's enough for me to call it 'good'.  I won't mind watching it again; and I'd definitely buy the DVD when it comes out."

","When every May comes, we all know that the Summer Blockbuster season starts. This year it begins with this latest action extravaganza. Unfortunately, this film embodies what the summer blockbuster has become. A soulless exercise in high budget frenziness. The movie looks great, the effects are mostly top of the line, but it lacks what I believe is essential to a good adventure movie, characters and a story that the audience cares about. This movie has some impressive action sequenses, but they are not as exhilerating as they should be. The pacing is breakneck, but the movie never stops to even give us 5 minutes to develop any semblance story or character. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, a monster killer, as we all know the arch nemesis of Dracula, in this movie we get wherwolves and Frankenstein's monster for good measure. The story is as cheesy as you get, Dracula wants to use Frankenstein to bring thousands of his offspring to life. Even a cheesy story can be involving;not this time.

Costume and Design was also done well.  In short, the film was aesthetically<br/><br/>pleasing.  [Incidentally, depending on the quality of this year's film on average, Van Helsing could find a nomination for Art Direction]<br/><br/>  Acting:  Kate Beckinsale fakes a great Romanian accent.  The character of her brother is well acted and one of the few highlights in this film.    Worthy of particular praise are Samuel West and Shuler Hensley.  Their portrayal of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, respectively, are so accurate to earlier portrayals of the characters it is practically chilling.<br/><br/>David Wenham:  Nice job on his part.  Nothing award-winning but he designed<br/><br/>and acted his character well.  Most of the funniest moments are due to his<br/><br/>delivery of lines and mannerism.<br/><br/>Key Problems: Plot: Too much is left unexplained.  Particularly, Van Helsing's relationship to<br/><br/>Dracula.  Attempts a mythological explanation for the Van Helsing character fail due to the lack of good plot exposition.  Simply put, by the end of the film you get the feeling that three or four scenes, which are necessary for the plot, were cut from the film.   What was intended to be interesting, almost mystical, simply fails to be<br/><br/>anything but confusing.  Even with a good understanding of Christian<br/><br/>mythology, the film leaves blatant holes unfilled. [on a side note: what was with the reference to the Bavarian Illuminati? Talk about dropping symbols for nothing and not tying it to any plot point.] Like  The Mummy and its sequel, the film had several one-liners and comedic<br/><br/>moments but many of them were flat, obvious, &/or simply not funny.<br/><br/>Acting: Kate Beckinsale did good work with the accent but the character is so much <br/><br/>more than that.  Moments of power and moments of weakness oscillate with the<br/><br/>character.  What starts as a smart and strategic character makes blatantly stupid decisions followed by being smart and tactical.  Multiple personalities? Maybe. Her fault or the writers? Probably both.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was acceptable but, unlike in other roles of his, he seemed to<br/><br/>just walk through the lines.  Comedy of this sort, like in the Mummy & its sequel, requires a great deal of effort on the part of the cast and it just didn't seem like that effort was there.<br/><br/>
In summation:  Save your money ! ! !   This film is worth renting, mainly for the one-liners.  Diehard monster-movie buffs will want to watch this for the<br/><br/>Frankenstein-opening and a few other scenes."

","Don't get me wrong, I'm all for CGI but not when it completely dominates the movie. Van Helsing utilized it way too much, from the buildings, to the characters, to the stunts, the environment, etc. It looked as though 90% of the movie was done completely on a computer. If you're going to use CG use it when you really have to, if it costs way too much to do the real deal or the model costs too much or you can make the image look very realistic (I know, it can't be perfect, but damn close to it is possible these days). LXG had this problem as well and it seems like the makers of Van Helsing didn't learn from LXG's mistakes.<br/><br/>The story, acting, cinematography were pretty good. Not amazing, but pretty good. Directing seemed kind of rushed to me as though Stephen Sommers just wanted to get to the next CGI scene or action scene.<br/><br/>The Mummy was an awesome movie. Absolutely fantastic and used CG when they had to, but a lot of camera, makeup and other tricks were used to bring out the world of early-20th century Egypt.

Why does Mr. Hyde look like the incredible Hulk anyway?  The acting isn't anything special, but since there is no one to act against since almost everything is CGI, that can be expected.

If only ""Van Helsing"" had even an ounce of the humor of that classic. <br/><br/>Director Sommers keeps things moving at a frenetic pace, from one action sequence to another. But the dialogue is awful and he really cares little about his characters. Instead, he seems captivated by the visual effects and, frankly, they can only take a movie so far. The vampire babies, which look more like gargoyles than bats, seem to be an amalgam of ""Aliens"" and ""Gremlins."" The brides are fun, but they're certainly not as sexy or titillating as the three in Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Granted, there's a gleefully campy sense to Richard Roxburgh's Dracula,<br/><br/>
Sommers treats his story too seriously. This film should be played with tongue firmly planted in cheek. But, unfortunately, due to some truly bad dialogue, I found myself laughing when, I am certain, Sommers did not plan on eliciting laughs. There are some well-placed bits of humor - most of them courtesy of David Wenham. <br/><br/>The good: a) Wenham providing delightful comic relief, proving how much better this film could have been had it adopted a lighter touch; b) Kate Beckinsale, her laughable accent notwithstanding, looking terrific in a bodice and knee-high boots; and c) Someone finally coming up with a line of dialogue to take care of the cinematic convention of the talking killer. And there's one funny throw-away line from an extra when Wenham sets off a tiny explosion in his lab.<br/><br/>One huge problem is Alan Silvestri's headache-inducing musical score. Sommers cranks up the volume so loud that the score not only becomes a distraction, it's awfully annoying, too. The film runs about 25 minutes too long and Sommers just doesn't know when to end his film.<br/><br/>After the film ended, the person I went with said, ""Well, it's better than 'The Matrix Revolutions.'"" That's not saying much, but, I suppose it's something."

","This is a really fun movie.  I went to the premiere tonight and, while the actual event was good, the movie just rocked me.<br/><br/>Like another reviewer here said, it's a beautifully shot visual effects movie.  But it's more than that because I also thought that the new Star Wars movies looked beautiful, but they didn't keep me interested because there was nothing more than visual effects.  Hugh Jackman was a great hero and the monsters were perfect.  No, it's not completely faithful to the legends we've seen in the classic movies, but that didn't bother me at all. Each monster took on a new life of their own and it was great to see how they could all blend together smoothly.<br/><br/>Obviously, Hugh Jackman is the lead, but the movie belongs to the director, Stephen Sommers.  He seems to have a good time with his movies and he keeps things moving really quickly (and loudly!), with not much time to recover from each scare or each laugh.  It's not scary like The Shining, it's not even scary like the original Dracula, its scares are more like brief frights, followed by a laugh.  Honestly, it's the epitome of a fun movie. Nothing heavy, nothing that'll make you think too much, just something that will take you away from it all."

","This movie is really a piece of art! On Saturday I have seen David Lynch's Blue Velvet for the first time. It was quite hard to digest and I had wonderful nightmares during the night because of the morbid atmosphere he establishes in his movies. I thought that these nightmares were a good inspiration to got to see Van Helsing the next day. And so I took a friend and we went to witness this `unique' experience.<br/><br/>
Some reviewers wrote quiet funny things. One said that the acting couldn't have been worse if there were sock puppets instead of real actors. One said, that the movie is as if someone wrote a LETTER ONLY WITH BIG LETTERS and another wrote that this movie is the king of all the cliché overloaded Hollywood blockbusters of recent years. And guess what?  They are all damn right! <br/><br/>From start to finish it is one big abuse of clichés. It is as if someone took every single cliché that was used in every single Jerry Bruckheimer production and threw in into one big hat, then stirred a little bit and made a film in the exact order of the items he draw. In fact the amount of clichés used in this movie is nothing less but ART. I have never seen something equal in my whole life and I've seen plenty of films.<br/><br/>
By the end of the film when my brain was transformed into a box of limp biscuits and my buttocks were swollen to the size of blimp (yes, the movie lasted for nearly two and a half hours and I could not sit still for only one minute because I squirmed like an brain amputated eel by trying to not to perceive any bit of the corny dialogue) I couldn't stop laughing. I had to laugh about the acting, I had to laugh about the cheesy looking GCI and I had to laugh because it was a greater nightmare to watch this film and for that to have wasted more than two hours of my life, than the nightmare I had the night before after watching Blue Velvet. So I begun to think about what could have made to movie even worse and at least I did find out what.<br/><br/>
Sommers could have given an employment to Orlando Bloom with his excessive abuse of just one single facial expression. An expression as if something heavy had fallen on his big toe and he's now waiting until the pain reaches his brain to process. His expression would have fit beautifully to the one single, tremendously long, monotonous fighting scene from the start to the finish of this travesty. <br/><br/>I cannot give this flick any ratings because otherwise I would have to buy the Imdb homepage and allow to rate negatively. Then I gave a -6 but since this is too extravagant I give you the advice to take a bath in a pool full of blood-hungry piranhas instead of wasting time, money and wits with thisya know.thing!"

This was another movie, like the entire matrix trilogy and any Tony Scott movie, that attempts to create style by tinting the entire movie blue.  I don't even care about the CGI, or even how they didn't try anything new with this movie, because it was just all around terrible.  Acting (especially that historian/assistant guy) was awful. Narrative was confusing, as evident by how the characters basically had to explain to the audience exactly what was happening ""this is werewolf fur, they shed on the first night after they've been bit"".  Lets see, what else. Lots of odd technology considering the time period, but I suppose frankenstein himself is impossible so I can't complain about that.

","SPOILER POSSIBILITY! SPOILER WARNING!<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was such an average movie. The story was basically just about Van Helsing, a man that was feared in Europe, hunting Dracula. The maker of the movie just chucked in famous fictions such as Dracula himself, with a bit of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Not forgetting the mythical harpy ladies. This movie was quite boring actually...it started off quite exciting, with all the Frankenstein stuff, Van Helsing chasing Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, and it went on with a really really predictable story line. IT WAS BORING. They tried to put a bit comedy with the comical role of Carl (David Wenham, who was cool in Lord of the Rings), the Friar, who unfortunately wasn't funny, the comedy was pretty lame.The werewolves looked really fake (poor CGI). Trite storyline. There's nothing special about this movie. The only thing I like was probably the automatic crossbow, that was pretty cool stuff. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was a more fun movie to watch than this one. Van Helsing is not worth watching at the movies."

At the end of the day, they managed to make a horror movie with vampires, werewolves, and the Frankenstein monster, and yet not have anything remotely scary in the film. More chills in Harry Potter. Some of the imagery was so spectacular, however, that I have to recommend it be seen in the theatre.

"divaclv","7","0","0","8 May 2004"," Campy, vampy, and entertaining
","""Van Helsing"" is a movie that's loud, flashy, shamelessly over-the-top, and frequently silly.  And so help me, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this isn't something I appreciated on the level of, say, ""Lost in Translation,"" or even ""Spider-Man,"" for that matter.  There's always a bit of guilt involved when I go along with this kind of material, born of the lingering knowledge that there are more intelligent and skillful movies out there.  And yet, when Steven Sommers' adrenaline-fueled monster mash threw caution (and logic) to the wind and took off like a vampire bat-woman out of hell, I was smiling faintly, content to accept the movie for the amusement-park ride it is.<br/><br/>The Van Helsing of the title is not the scholarly Abraham of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" but adventuresome Gabriel, played by Hugh Jackman.  He's kind of a Victorian MiB agent, taking orders from a secret ecumenical order working underneath St. Peter's Basilica.  ""We have protected mankind since time immemorial,"" a cardinal intones, as he passes through a room where priests, rabbis, imams, Bhuddist monks, and assorted others work side-by-side.  Given the number of innocents who have died (and are still dying) because two or more of the represented faiths refused to get along with each other, one might suggest that they're not doing a very good job-but to borrow a phrase from Ebert, this is supplying logic where it is manifestly not wanted.  Van Helsing's mission, should he choose to accept it: go to Transylvania, hunt down Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and kill him.<br/><br/>Riding on this is the salvation of nine generations' worth of souls from the Romany clan Valerious, who in accordance with an ancient pact cannot enter Heaven until Drac is vanquished.  The Valerious family is down to its last two scions: brother Velkan (Will Kemp), who's been bitten by a werewolf, and sister Anna (Kate Beckinsale), on whom the local vampires would like to visit a similar fate.  Dracula, meanwhile, has his own agenda, involving bringing life to his stillborn offspring via the experiments of a certain Dr. Frankenstein.  All this (and more) makes for a very crowded movie, and the story winds up not unlike Frankenstein's ultimate project: the parts don't fit together seamlessly, but as a whole it manages to work-most of the time.<br/><br/>With decent F/X and excellent settings (which look like they sprung from the collective imaginations of Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, and Edgar Allan Poe), ""Van Helsing"" is a handsome film visually.  Speaking of handsome, Jackman cuts a fine figure in the lead role and, while the script doesn't always give him a whole lot to work with, he works well with what he's given.  His Van Helsing covers much of the same ground as Wolverine (both characters are lone warriors with large gaps in their memory) but does so with a soberer, more conscientious bent.  David Wenham has fun (and is fun to watch) in the sidekick role, a friar of strong intelligence and questionable spirituality. On the monster side of things, Shuler Hensley does the best work as Frankenstein's creation, a not-so-gentle giant who ends up being an unlikely ally for the heroes.  But while Roxburgh looks good as a seedily aristocratic Dracula, his performance could have done with a bit more menace and a lot less scenery-chewing.  I'm inclined to blame Sommers for this, since Roxburgh is somewhat effective in his more restrained moments-there's a nice bit where he attempts to seduce Anna at a masked ball-and in any case, it's still a step or two up from Gerard Butler's lifeless portrayal in `Dracula 2000.'<br/><br/>`Van Helsing' starts off strong, with a gorgeous black-and-white prologue, and has enough good action sequences to keep things moving.  Only towards the end of its two-and-a-quarter hours running time does it begin to lose steam.  But well before then, most audience members will have decided to go along for the ride, or opt out altogether.  I chose the former, and had fun-but others may do as they see fit."

Like I feel many (not all!)who are writing adversely about this film is doing.  <br/><br/>You see, after a week like that, I needed something to take my mind off that world. To relax, to unwind, to enjoy. I got to see Van Helsing and it did the trick. I laughed, I was entertained, I forgot about the seriousness of the world and enjoyed mindless, fun entertainment for a few hours. Does anybody know how rare that is these days? Some folks wish to be a ""shock-jock"" type of critic or seem to want to look for so much in nothing -- and sometimes, you just need to let your mind go, have an imagination and be open. Van Helsing is not a Documentary, it's not an independent film, its not an art house film. This is one of those films that just wants you to have a good time.<br/><br/>I liked this film very much, I liked the CGI - to a point (okay, I'm a fan of Lon Chaney and Lon Chaney Jr.) and I liked Hugh. I've enjoyed Kevin O'Connor of late and knew that was him as Igor..well, he had the best line in the film that just cracked me up. The ""brides"" made ALL the guys from 15 to 21 get REALLY interested in the film...as did the character Anna. (Isn't that what it's about these days?!) And the Monk..well..let me just say, bravo to the actor for making a ""departure"" from his last known famous role. He did well. And it was kinda..nice..seeing the old Universal creatures on screen in THIS the new millenium, even though I loved them better in the old films, but WHO is looking at the old films? Well, this is one of those movies that may MAKE newer moviegoers do that. At least, I hope so.<br/><br/>Entertaining, fun, visually interesting. Was worth my matinee money.  For those who want more ""seriousness"" in their plots, please go to an art house film. (But it's my guess that those who have something to say against this film, wouldn't be caught dead going into an art house to see a 'serious' film.)<br/><br/>So lighten up. Clear your mind, go see Van Helsing just to enjoy yourself in mindless entertainment! Life right now is too short and too serious for real to argue over something so imaginative."

I got neither.  It seems that the director was so intent on spending the budget money toward special effects that he forgot some important concepts: plot and character development. ""Van Helsing"", the movie, was shallow, hard to follow due to the director insisting on relying on special effects that were often times too fast, and lame with its attempts at humor.

","Van Helsing  1/5<br/><br/>After the film, my friend turned to me and said `Aren't you sick of the over-use of computer animation in movies these days?' With Van Helsing, the answer is a resounding YES!  This is yet another film that proves that special effects alone cannot make up for a lousy script.  The best special effects are still the ones you don't know are special effects.<br/><br/>With VH going after vampires and werewolves at the same time, you just knew this was going to be a compromise.<br/><br/>There's nothing particularly scary in the film. The best monster of all happens to be Dr Frankenstein's monster, who actually does have a heart and a mind.  Hommage is paid to James Bond Q department and maybe a bit of Indiana Jones and Spiderman.  Unlike Indiana Jones, the Van Helsing character is humourless, flat and uninvolving.  The first Spiderman film had a heart.  This film has virtually no pulse.<br/><br/>With a rating of PG-14, you knew Van Helsing was going to be a juvenile, silly affair, and it hits the mark precisely.  There's got to be a video game version coming soon.  Is it worth seeing again or buying on DVD?  I don't think so.  Let's hope there won't be a sequel.<br/><br/>Review by Triniman"

","I'll get to `Van Helsing' in a bit, but first<br/><br/>I was a huge fan of the original `Howard the Duck' comic book. Artist Frank Brunner told me this story: A few years after co-creating `Howard the Duck,' Frank visited the effects house, ILM, looking for work. As the ILM people leafed through his amazing portfolio, one said, `You draw almost as good as our guys. (insult) We have this film coming up called `Howard the Duck. We might be able to use you on that.' (injury)<br/><br/>Hubris and Ignorance, the film industry's most famous couple, eclipsing even Tracy and Hepburn, Astaire and Rodgers and Abott and Costello. (Who also met The Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster.)<br/><br/>`Howard the Duck' was made shortly after `Ghostbusters.' It was clear that the ILM effects team wanted to out-do that film in every way it could, and the result was one of the most overblown, senseless motion pictures in history. I was so shaken from seeing it in the theater that I quickly visited a friend who calmed me with Orson Welles' `Chimes at Midnight.' I was still shaking the next day, so we took in Eric Rohmer's `Boyfriends and Girlfriends.' Peace at last.<br/><br/>The film, `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' was criticized for many things, but it did have certain charms of its own. One was the clever portrayal of Mr. Hyde via an actor wearing prosthetics rather than using a CG character, excepting the climax, which gave us a small taste of what was to come in `Van Helsing.' The second I saw a fully CG Mr. Hyde appear in `Van Helsing' I knew I was going to have to dig into my library for every Eric Rohmer film I had. Clearly, ILM was out to prove that it could over-blow any movie, even `Howard the Duck.' More is not better, guys, especially when every eye in the theater understands that what they are looking at is not in the least bit real. I have to blame director Stephen Sommers here. With `The Mummy Returns' he demonstrated that he could push, push, push, the effects crews to the point where the best they could do was their worst.<br/><br/>I managed to sit through `Van Helsing' without trauma, but only because I had been inoculated with `Howard the Duck.' Is `Van Helsing' as horrible as everyone says? Be your own judge. Lot's of people I saw it with seemed to enjoy themselves. But before you go, make sure to rent an amusing, slowly paced French film for your recovery.<br/><br/>PS  I really liked `Deep Rising.' Dial it back, Steve."

The Music ... the soundtrack music to this movie is probably its strongest quality ... the background music that plays while Van Helsing and Carl are riding through the mountains is probably the strongest example of a very well composed soundtrack.<br/><br/>2. Certain actors put on a very good performance ... David Wenham fans, you can look forward to a good performance by him as Carl in this movie ... while many will disagree with me, I also found Richard Roxburgh's acting as Dracula to be very good ... many have said his acting was ""over the top"", but I found him to be convincing ... <br/><br/>3.

(aside from some of the ADR by some of the actors)<br/><br/>The Bad News:<br/><br/>1. There were also some poor acting performances ... do not expect too much from Kate Beckinsale or Hugh Jackman (both of which I have enjoyed in previous movies) ... however, before I hit them too hard, I think the problem was with the script they had to work with, not their own acting abilities ... <br/><br/>2. Now the special effects bad news ... WAY too much ... special effects should be like candy in a diet ... an occasional thing that we enjoy and look forward to, but if we have too much, it can make you sick ... the special effects, while good, occurred FAR too much ...<br/><br/>
3. The plot ... the plot was difficult to get involved in, which, for me anyway, is one of the deciding factors in a good movie ... you have to capture the interest of the audience very early, and pull them in to the point where they want to see everything that happens next ... here, I felt the plot jumped sometimes, and that the movie put a few ""push"" moments in the middle of the film ... (push moments being introductions of plot points that can suddenly turn the direction of the movie) ... that could have used a little work ... <br/><br/>
So, the overall score? 7.5 ... which is described basically as ""not bad, but you won't be disappointed if you wait for video rental ...

"Steven Reynolds","2","0","0","8 May 2004"," The end of imagination
","Designed in a boardroom, created on a computer, ""Van Helsing"" is the unholy progeny of a serial plagiarist and insatiable corporate greed.  The result is the cinematic equivalent of a computer-generated woman: lovely to look at, but brain-dead and ultimately inhuman.  Laughably unbearable when it isn't merely puerile, ""Van Helsing"" sees Sommers take his aping of Spielberg to new lows, while expanding his derivative grasp to squander James Whale, more of Universal's back catalogue of monsters  Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man  and the worst elements of John Williams and George Lucas.  The film's monochrome opening in Transylvania pays tribute to Whales' ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) with a frenzied, torch-lit mob armed with pitchforks and scythes surging toward Dr. Frankenstein's castle against a huge night sky.  Sommers might claim he was aiming for homage but it ends up playing like a mockery  or, at best, a nod to Mel Brooks.  ""Van Helsing"" is postmodern in the worst sense: a collage of cinematic references distorted through a high-tech lens, assembled for no other purpose than liberating money from the wallets of gullible teens.  About twenty minutes in you ""get it""; you realise why this film is so awful.  It doesn't need to tell a story, because it isn't a film: it's an ear-flaying, mind-raping 132-minute commercial for ancillary markets  the toys, the TV show and the video game  all of which, as Universal happily admits, are ready and waiting for the greenlight if the ""film"" cracks the undisclosed boxoffice nut.  The saddest thing is that ""Van Helsing"" doesn't need to be this bad. Boxoffice infernos can be stoked with quality product, e.g. ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  It just requires talent.  For Sommers, handing over the writing to someone with an imagination probably would have been enough.  For unlike that other doyen of event films, Jerry Bruckheimer, who has an unparalleled gift for assembling Z-grade talent, Sommers was blessed with a stellar cast and an immensely talented crew.  Yet he does nothing but ritually humiliate them.  And his sources.  And us.  It's sadly ironic that most of Sommers' literary sources sprang from minds  indeed, a whole era  which worried about the intersection of culture and unbridled technology.  A century later, what has it delivered?  The hairy butt-crack of a digital Mr. Hyde."
"clydestuff","7","0","0","8 May 2004"," Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolves, Dracula, Mr. Hyde, the gangs all here.
","I think I've got this film critic business figured out.  After reading many of the reviews for Van Helsing, the great majority of which soundly panned the film, I have come to the following conclusion:  Critics loathe the summer film season.  They especially seem to loathe high budgeted special effects extravaganzas such as Van Helsing, especially when the trailers for it have been bombarding our senses for months, and you can't turn on the TV without hearing about it.  One would have to assume that they when they view a film such as this, there is a certain amount of bias working against it. So in reviewing the $200 million dollar Universal extravaganza, I think my job is supposed to be to blast the film into Hades with another scathing review.  Sorry, I can't do it. As it turns out, I did enjoy the film.<br/><br/>What Writer and Director Stephen Sommers does do is to entertain us with a multitude of exciting hair raising sequences, aided by some spectacular CGI effects, and a cast of characters that hearken back to the old black and white films of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, and Dracula. Even Mr. Hyde is on hand briefly to liven things up.  <br/><br/>The film opens with a black and white sequence that is straight out of the original Frankenstein film.  Everything is here just as it should be, including Dr. Frankenstein, his not so loyal servant Igor, the monster himself, and the torch bearing citizens of Transylvania who are intent on having Frankenburgers courtesy of the Doctor and his protégé. What is different however, is that Count Dracula himself is on hand for the unveiling of Dr. Frankenstein's Monster, and has his own personal agenda to attend to.  Unfortunately for Count Dracula, the Monster regards Dr. Frankenstein as Daddy Dr. Frankenstein, and doesn't take too kindly to what the Count has in store for him.  It's a stunning, cleverly written opening to the film, and sets a relentless which barely leaves you time to breathe as it hurdles on fast forward from one action laden episode to the next.<br/><br/>From the creation of Frankenstein Monster's we are immediately taken to the Notre Dame Cathedral where Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, is doing battle with Dr. Jekyll's alter ego Mr. Hyde.  By placing Hyde in the cathedral, Sommers manages also to pay a little big of homage to The Hunchback of Notre Dame. His mission, which comes directly from Rome, is to try and bring Hyde back to Rome alive to be studied if possible.  It is here with his own wry perspective on the matter that Jackman reminded me of a late nineteenth century James Bond.  He'll do the job and get it done, but he'll do it his way, orders or no orders.  It's a nice minor touch that immediately gives Jackman's Van Helsing a distinctive touch of personality not seen in any previous film incarnation of the character.<br/><br/>Later, Van Helsing is ordered by Rome to travel to Transylvania to aid the lovely Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) in her quest to find and destroy Count Dracula.  It seems Anna and the family from which she is descended from, have been after Dracula for some time.  The only members of the family who are left to continue on with the quest are Anna and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp), and should they die before finishing their mission, their family will be damned to eternity in purgatory.  Along with Van Helsing is a Rome inventor and sidekick, Carl (David Wenham).  (He's a Friar not a Monk, and so is entitled to certain worldly pleasures).  It's a great bit that adds  some welcome humorous touches, lest we begin taking things a bit too serious.<br/><br/>Where this film also excels is not just the adrenaline rushing action sequences.  Sommers uses the CGI, not just for a myriad of heart-pounding special effects,  but is smart enough to create an atmosphere where we can easily accept the notion that this is indeed Europe in the late nineteenth century.  In one scene, as the camera traverses the landscape of Paris, we see in the background a half-built Eiffel Tower.  It is this kind of meticulous attention to details that help lift this film a couple of notches above others in the genre by transporting us into a world we can immerse ourselves in completely.<br/><br/>If the film has a fault, it is minor.  In the early moments, one is not sure if we are going to be witnessing an action film or a spoof.  Much of this is due to the initial campy over the top portrayal of Dracula by Richard Roxburgh and a few of his female disciples.  After the opening sequence during the creation of Frankenstein's Monster, Roxburgh and everyone else seems to settle down into just the right tone needed for the remainder of the running time.<br/><br/>If you go into Van Helsing knowing that your are going to get two hours plus of non-stop sights and sounds to hammer your senses, along with some harmless mindless entertainment, you'll enjoy the film in all aspects.  It is highly imaginative, and very entertaining.  I had fun, and that's all I asked for.  And if I get what I ask for I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Van Helsing is a B+."

","Kudos to the marketing department of Van Helsing. There was so much hype has been generated for this movie that it was in my must-watched films. Superb posters showing Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale in stylish best, great suspenseful trailers. Even the movie premiere was aptly timed with a full moon.<br/><br/>If only the movie was just as good as the marketing department.<br/><br/>Even an almost-bare bodied Jackman and corset-wrapped Beckinsale could not save the movie. Set in the late 19th century when vampires, werewolves, gnomes and the Frankenstein monster roamed, Van Helsing was a cross between League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and James Bond, but less camp, less ingenious, more bore. The 2 hours and 15 minutes were filled with razzle-dazzle effects and cheap scare tactics, mostly found in B-grade movies. The worst were the out-of-the-world swinging around a rope -- makes you wonder if director Stephen Sommers had been watching too much Spiderman.<br/><br/>The saving grace came in the form of David Welham. As a loyal friar friend to Jackman's Van Helsing character, Welham was earnest and lovable. But for the rest of the cast, zombies probably had better lines and emotion range."

","In my opinion, Van Helsing is targeted at the X-Men Genre (being teens). While many adults can see the flaws of this movie, I think that many teens are going to really enjoy this one.  The action is non-stop and the computer generated images are pretty solid.  Ok, I agree with some of the comments that the acting is poor, it isnt great, but it is entertaining.<br/><br/>   I was able to take my 21 year old girlfriend to this and she didnt complain one time during the movie.  This from a person who likes sappy movies from Legally Blonde to the Rugrats.  Although, not quite as good to me as Underworld, Van Helsing was able to deliver on the action goods as advertised in trailers on TV.  Jackman is decent as VanHelsing and Beckinsale is at least nice to look at.  The girl that play Mishkala ( I think her name is Josie something) was most impressive to me in her limited role- she reeked of evil and seduction.  <br/><br/>   So why not take your teens to see something that will at least entertain them for 2 hours.  There are a lot worse things they could see or be doing. For my 28 yr old perspective, some of the scenes are a bit unrealistic (see the stage coach scene and some of the parts near the end with beckinsale) but all in all I have to give this one a 7."

It's never a good thing when you can bookmark the same face/teardrop/breathy voice eight times in one movie ...

Is asked to travel to a different country, to fight a vampire menace named Dracula(Richard Roxburgh), and he teams up with another vampire hunter(Kate Beckinsale) in hopes of destroying this menace of evil.

Yes, she's extremely gorgeous but I'm not that big of a horndog.  I just was tired at looking at silly CGI that offered nothing new.  Hugh Jackman had better shelve this franchise and get back to the clever franchise that's made him a star.  The X-Men franchise is everything Van Helsing isn't.

"JAKastner","7","0","0","7 May 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Van Helsing
","Another summer season has come upon us at the box office with many major releases opening within its first few weeks all in an effort to gather as much coinage as they possibly can before Spider-Man 2 steamrolls its way into theaters. Anything after that film better be pretty damn good to compete with it but that is another topic for another day. Prior to 1999 the summer season kicked off around Memorial Day weekend as children began to slowly be released from schools across the country but that was before The Mummy opened to $43 million the weekend of May 7th, 1999, which, in effect, changed the way studios dealt with the summer heat. In the two years that followed, both Gladiator (2000) and The Mummy Returns (2001) opened on the first weekend of May to fantastic numbers but that never became the official kick-off point for the summer until Spider-Man sealed the deal in 2002, opening to $115 million its opening weekend. Universal studios doesn't expect that much with the opening of Van Helsing but they do expect a decent return as it is not often that they shell out $160 million (and then some) for one film especially in the current situation they are in with their new parent company. But considering Stephen Sommers, the same man who directed The Mummy and its sequel, is at that reins, there's a sure bet the cult followers will be out in droves once again.<br/><br/>The story follows the adventures a man sent by a secret society to go out into the world to vanquish evil creatures such as the Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula and stop their reins of terror on humanity. Van Helsing is known throughout most of Europe, either as a holy man or as a murderer, but the man behind God's work has no memory of who he is or where he comes from. All he knows is that he is in the service of the Catholic Church sent to different parts of the world to stop evil in the form of monsters and demons. There's nothing in the job description about being well liked by the people he is trying to protect. His latest assignment is to travel to Transylvania to destroy the powerful Count Dracula while at the same time protect Anna Valerious, the last of her family's lineage who had sworn to do anything in their power to destroy Dracula and end his rein of terror. But Dracula has a plan of his own  he devises a course of action in using Frankenstein's monster as well as the Wolfman in his efforts to raise up a force of bat-like children to rule over humanity with fear and terror. There's only one man who stands in his way, who has the force of God on his side: Van Helsing. The story for Van Helsing is hard to really grasp but not in the sense you would think. The film isn't a real puzzler or anything of that nature (Good vs. Evil  not much to figure out here) but one does have to have a tolerance for campy action flicks or else this will be a complete waste of time. Though the film is clichéd at moments, surprisingly it wasn't so much as was to be expected, if that helps at all to those who disliked The Mummy films.<br/><br/>No one may actually be going into this film for the sole purpose of seeing any particular star within it, which is probably the reason why there are only two (one if you want to get into specifics) big names in the cast, but none the less the cast of Van Helsing offers some decent performances, nothing Oscar caliber by any means, while at the same presenting several prominent disappointments. Hugh Jackman, who is best known for his performance of Wolverine in the X-Men film series, gives an engaging performance as Abraham Van Helsing, though no where near the one given by Sir Anthony Hopkins in Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was to be expected. The only problem lies with the character itself as the script starts off with many questions and yet answers very few of the them by the end, which could or could not point to a possible sequel in the works. Kate Beckinsale, who hasn't been able to make a name for her self in the sense of truly carrying a film on her name alone just yet, works with what is given to her as best she can but there really isn't much emotional attachment with the character to be really all that concerned for what happens to her within the course of the film. Though it was Sommer's intent on resurrecting (in a sense) interest in Dracula, the vision seems to be lost with Richard Roxburgh's go around as he is way too over-the-top in a way that's laughable at times and, at times, confusing. The same would have to go for Dracula's Brides played Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran, who become so irritating in their performances that the audience will be applauding at their demises, and not for the reasons they should be doing so.<br/><br/>Overall, Van Helsing kicks off the 2004 summer box office with more of a whimper then a driving force and only shatters the hopes of those who were awaiting an enthusiastic kick-off as had always been accustomed in the past. As with Hellboy, Van Helsing falls into the category of films that doesn't leave you clamoring to see it again nor is it a feature that you would detest repeating, if it were presented to you again. The first third of the film (dividing the film into three parts) was quite exciting, mysterious, and filled with wall-to-wall action, which makes the other two thirds of the film all the more disappointing. There is nothing as bad as a film that sets you up for quality entertainment only to knock you down with a weak follow-through. The problem lies with the script itself which becomes too bogged down with numerous plot lines and character aspects and quickly deteriorates into a mundane and repetitive camp film. There's nothing wrong with camp films as long as they are done right, which isn't the case with Van Helsing. Another issue that was clearly prominent throughout the film was the blatant over-use of CGI effects, which often looked fake, no more so then in the scene where the Wolfman jumps across the fire on the wagon toward Van Helsing or the transformation of Dracula, which just looked ridiculous. And there was a small problem the musical score, which, every so often, sounded too familiar to the score for The Mummy, but nothing major to complain about. There are three types of people who will be disappointed by this film: fans of the classic novel (and film) Dracula, those who fell for the hype, and all others who aren't just entertained by a few mere explosions and boobs flashed on the screen. Van Helsing will surely go down as one of the bigger disappointments of the summer season.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)"

","This movie has non-stop action, but I was bored.  I just can't work myself up to care much about these characters since they weren't developed effectively.<br/><br/>Yes, we're told that the Anna's family has been killed by Dracula and there has been an ongoing feud. We're even shown some events leading up to the main story, but I just didn't care a whole lot.  Dropping a little lead-in to the story doesn't always work as character development. Most of the movie is big, banal, and boring.<br/><br/>To be fair, some of the fight sequences were interesting and about 4 or 5 different lines in the movie got laughs from the audience, but overall this isn't a movie worth paying $7-$12 to see.  Teens may enjoy it on an outing with their friends, and they may feel like they're seeing something dark or edgy.  I suspect it won't interest most over- 25-year-olds much, since they'll see a lot of posturing.<br/><br/>The pacing wasn't effective.  Stephen Sommers is apparently afraid to let his characters interact in any significant way except fighting.  He doesn't allow much down time between fights for character development, plot development, or even for contrast.  It all seems like one long fight scene for 2 hours and 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Hand in hand with the pacing, the music is terribly wrong.  It does the wrong things at the wrong times.  It stays on a hyperactive note for the entire movie--which contributes to the pacing and contrast problems.  I got very tired of the drums and orchestra hits at completely inappropriate times. The music tries to make everything seem huge, exciting, or terrifying and succeeds in making everything seem exactly the same for the entire movie. It only wants to play one mood for the entire length.  Sometimes less is more, and some restraint and variety are required--something that neither the director nor the composer did right.<br/><br/>There were a few things that made me laugh in this movie although they were not intended to make me laugh.<br/><br/>The squishy/slurpy/slimy sound-effects in part of the movie were so over-the-top that they just called attention to themselves and made me chuckle.<br/><br/>Then there was the CHiPs moment at the end of a vehicle chase scene. Hmm, what's the most spectacular ending for a chase scene in CHiPs and most other 70s cop shows?  Expect the same here.  I know there was an explanation. It was still funny, explanation or not.<br/><br/>The special effects mostly looked like they cost the studio a lot--which is probably why they seem desperate for this movie to succeed.  You'll get some eye candy, so if that's what you're looking for, you might enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>In all, unless you're a teen, you only want to see this movie as a time waster, or for the special effects, I'd go get the video game instead.  It's sure to be more involving."
"jrfranklin01","Null","0","0","7 May 2004"," Good CGI and action, but little emphasis on story
","If you want today's non-stop action and explosive adventure scenes, then this movie will provide little disappointment.  However, if you are also looking for any drama backed by a well-thought storyline, then you may find this film coming up shy.<br/><br/>The plot is rather simple.  A monster-hunter recruited by the Vatican, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), embarks on a mission to kill the evil Count Dracula. To spice things up a bit, he also has to face The Werewolf and Frankenstein.  These classic confrontations are not much different from any other film other than the computer-generated images (CGI) that are included. Van Helsing has a selection of weapons that are a medieval version of the toys James Bond has.  And also like Bond films, Kate Beckinsale provides the necessary alluring femme fatale role.  Also of this you can gather from the thirty second trailer if you've seen it, but like all trailer's, they are designed to hype the film. <br/><br/>There is some irony in Jackman's Wolverine role from X-Men, but to keep from spoiling the movie I will spare you the details.  I can however say that looking for some plausibility and trying to digest the details of the movies progression may prove challenging and in the end, pointless.  I was given the impression too much was left to chance in the storyline on how things came to pass, and since I was being fed new information at such a rapid rate, I was left to believe it was a snow-job on the director's part.  But not to frown on the movie too much, I can tell you that you are taken on a wild adventure/crusade against evil.  There isn't any real gore or intense violence in the film.  Most of the violence is the classic vampire impaling with CGI to enhance the subsequent death.  I found the movie far from scary but more action-oriented."
"Juni78ukr","6","0","0","7 May 2004"," Typical summer blockbuster with colossal budget and numerous flaws
","I have seen Van Helsing today in premiere screening and I have found this movie just okay, but I never expect too much from most of summer blockbusters. If you really want to enjoy this summer flick you should leave your brains at home and don't think about acting, plot holes, logical mistakes and other such things. Visual and sound effects were very good, while fight scenes looked pretty dynamic and well made. Computer-generated creatures were exciting and looked almost real. But leave the technical part and computer-generated visuals alone and let's face the most problem parts: the script and acting. Sometimes I have a terrible feeling that something's going wrong with Hollywood screenwriters. Most of recent movies I have seen had so lame script and Van Helsing don't make an exception. You can find here all typical flaws: bad character development, very weak supporting characters, weak and silly dialogs as well as lack of ordinary logic. You know that acting is the weakest point of such high-budgeted summer movies, so don't expect anything great here. Hugh Jackman, who was very good in X-2, this time showed inability to carry movie alone. Cate Beckinsale was miserable as lead female character. Richard Roxburgh as a main villain was too wooden and unemotional. David Wenham (guy who played Faramir in LoTR) definitely deserved something better than such pitiful and mostly unfunny part of superhero's friend and assistant. It looks like they were trying to create character of some kind of cool but awkward guy (like Jonathan in Mummy and Mummy Returns) but they were also wrong here. But despite all numerous flaws nevertheless it's entertained and even enjoyable movie, mostly because it never pretended to be a serious movie. And because of that reason I think it don't worse than much more successful Spider-man 2 and I, Robot which pretended to be something more solid and easily failed there. Overall, Van Helsing is average summer blockbuster, that is worth for watching once but don't expect anything great and memorable here. For Stephen Sommers this movie is another step down after his much more entertained and pleasant Mummy movies.<br/><br/>My grade 5.9 out of 10"

I grew up with a family and in a town with alot of Hungarians, Romanians, etc. and he does an excellent job.  Having to live up to the reputations of actors playing the Dracula part (Lugosi, Lee, Langella, Oldman) is a tuff job and Roxburgh, to me, has created the ultimate version, lethal, sexy, seductive and one to sympathize with.  I came away liking Dracula more than the Van Helsing character (the most hated hero in movies)."

","The film starts with action , has action in the middle and finishes with action. It is also the loudest film I have ever seen. Hugh Jackman is a 19th century 007 complete with 19th century gadgets. Even some of the bond type humour is injected into the film. Overall his performance is completely shadowed by the special effects people. Kate Beckinsale is not a bond girl(she doesn't double cross him) but she is definitely there for her looks rather than her acting. The film starts in 19th century Paris and the set is amazing, even the Eiffel Tower is only half built. A pretty impressive Mr Hyde is then slayed by Jackman before the real adventure begins. After a brief stopover at headquarters Jackman heads to Transylvannia to take on the main man Dracula.From there the CGI just gets better and better. Every monster creation is magnificently detailed and truly terrifying. Don't wait for charactor development scenes, there aren't any. Truth is the film doesn't need them. The action speaks for itself. What surprises me most about this film is the 12A certificate. Sure there is no nudity, graphic violence or bad language but it can be pretty harrowing. It will scare the bejesus out of young children who will be able to legally see it. This is not a film for the lovers of quality drama but it does exactly what it says on the tin.

","Van Helsing is a movie about a demon hunter without a memory, working for the Vatican, sent in to protect the last heirs of an old Romanian family from being destroyed and to kill Dracula.<br/><br/>So there. End of story.<br/><br/>The rest is eye candy. Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, Jekyll and Hyde, and every other vaguely gothic character all make appearances. It feels like ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" in that respect.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the movie is OK, not great. It suffers from some serious problems: Stephen Sommers just isn't a good writer. If he does exposition, you get five minutes of someone giving a ""as you know"" monologue to a nodding Van Helsing. If he does romance, you get George-Lucas style quotes. If he does literature, you get literal quotes from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, oddly out of place in this lightweight movie. The bad writing isn't helped by a flawed storyline: The Vatican deploys Helsing to protect the family of some fool who, 400 years ago, swore that neither him nor his descendants would enter heaven unless Dracula was dead. Hello? Does anyone care, if the guy was such a fool? Finally, the writing struggles with a definite flaw: The franchise-aspirations. The movie hints at certain things, but does not explain the history, leaving the door wide open for a prequel.<br/><br/>
The second main problem is the soundtrack: It isn't bad. But to have the Van Helsing theme tune playing in full action mode while the character leisurely walks around is ridiculous. He isn't exploding! He idn't being shot at! He isn't even driving a sexy car (something which often warrants a theme tune in James Bond)! His horse isn't impressive! All he has is his funny hat!<br/><br/>So, film makers: Learn subtlety. Learn to write exposition in less painful ways (or at least name the character ""Basil Exposition"" in self-referring humour). Don't overuse CGI (I was hoping Robbie Coltrane would be Mr Hyde, not the voice of Mr animated-Hyde). <br/><br/>Brilliant eye candy, half-ruined by poor writing and lack of subtlety.<br/><br/>

And this is the film's biggest mistake.  If Sommers had cut an action scene or two and replaced them with smaller more intimate moments, this could have been something special.  As it is, it's just enjoyable trash with nice expensive CGI and great production values.<br/><br/>I liked the ending but as I said, since the characters aren't rounded, we don't feel the strong emotions we should.

","*Here there be spoilers!*<br/><br/>Once again, a movie where viewer reactions run the full gamut from ""great!"" to ""terrible!"" - which must mean it's an interesting movie!<br/><br/>And so it is. Despite what some people claim, it actually has an interesting and complex story: Dracula and his three brides are desperate for progeny, and have set huge plans in motion to that end; plans which comprise the culmination of the movie. And Gabriel Van Helsing himself... well, let's just say that his first name is no coincidence. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story is told in fits and starts, parts of it even backwards. The narrative structure is a mess. Which is probably the reason that some of the audience fail to even notice the coherent story. Seriously.<br/><br/>What I was feeling during most of this movie was: Rewrites galore. We have here a movie that starts out as comedy, and then gets more and more serious as it progresses, ending up as a tragedy! It seems to me that the script was originally serious and tragic, and then sometime in the production process some Hollywood executives decreed that no-one could take this seriously, so it had to be turned into a tongue-in-cheek comedy.<br/><br/>This might have worked if they'd gone comical all the way. But they left in the tragic finale, with the death of the heroine! That was, excuse me for saying so, real stupid. (On the other hand, it occurs to me that the writers may have intended her death as a happy ending for *her*, since it meant she got to be with her dead family - but that's really too esoteric for most viewers, myself included.) Of course, I may be wrong about the rewrites, and this thing was a mess of bad writing from the beginning. Entirely possible. But I like the other theory better.<br/><br/>This movie actually does have a lot of things going for it. For a movie buff, its myriad references to other movies, from Aliens to Sherlock Holmes, are very entertaining to spot. For this reason alone, I wouldn't put it past this movie to eventually develop a cult audience. There are also a couple of good lines (""Do unto others, before they do unto you!""), although only a few.<br/><br/>The SFX were impressive. Some say they're cheesy, but that's just not true. The effects in *Underworld* were cheesy (and I still liked it!), but the ones in Van Helsing are MUCH better. There's so much good stuff here. Castles, cityscapes, rock bridges, animated paintings... Dracula's brides are very cleverly done, esp. when they change into their human forms. And the final transformation of Gabriel into the Wolf Man is great!<br/><br/>
However - when all is said and done, the movie really is a mess. There are lots of situations with which a lot could have been done, but they merely serve as throwaways. There doesn't seem to be any deeper meaning to any of the action (except that it's all God's will or something similarly silly). And in the end the story doesn't satisfy. In the end, this is just another B-movie with only one real reason to watch it: the female lead.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale is a vision of beauty and coolness. I never liked corsets until this movie. Her dark eyes and shock of dark-brown curls are absolutely delicious. Her character is stylish, spiritted and courageous, with just a hint of vulnerability. If you don't like Kate Beckinsale, you, sir, have no taste.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."

","I've seen a lot of movies that I've loved but got terrible reviews on imdb, but Van Helsing really doesn't deserve all the hassle it's getting. It's either some people say the CGI or terrible or over done (make up your mind people). Or people compared it to the black and white classics, yes, they were very good movies, but Van Helsing is a completely different type of movie. You can tell by just looking at it, I can't understand how either can be compared. For the strangest reasons, you get people complaining about the logic in a movie about Vampires, Werewolves and a Frankenstein monster. Find the logic in that pile of nonsense.<br/><br/>I've waited to see this movie ever since it was in casting phase, my expectations were very high, and I wasn't let down. I loved almost every aspect of the film, apart from the ending. **Spoiler*** The faces in the sky were just way too cheesy for even me, it really would of been a better ending if that one scene were cut out. ***End Spoiler*** I love the creativity they gave to the monsters, a person shedding there skin, and the Frankenstein monster's electricity. Though sometimes, Frakenstein's character seemed a tad bit over done, as if he were performing in a shakespearian play. That was my only beef with the movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to have a good time at the movies.<br/><br/>
If you want to see an award winner, go buy Lost in Translation. By Van Helsing's trailer, you can tell what kind of movie you're paying for."

","I just saw this movie in a preview in the UK. his movie is awful. It begins fair, in a black and white sequence, which is the only stand out scene. The rest of the movie falls flat from there on. The acting is terrible, especially from Dracula and his 3 brides. They have the worst Transylvania accents I have heard. This movie will probably have a huge opening weekend, but I warn you its is awful, even with low expectations. It is a brainless, terrible excuse for a movie and really has little to offer, except: sub-par action sequences, shoddy acting, phony accents, big plot holes and terrible CGI.

","Van Helsing was an entertaining movie from start to finish. That is all I ask of a movie. Dracula, Frankenstein and The Wolfman all make appearances. Hugh Jackman is great as the tough guy monster fighter. Of course he's had plenty of practice in the first two X-Men movies. Kira Knightly can no longer complain about wearing a corset after seeing the outfit, Kate Beckinsale is forced to wear throughout the show. I have heard that Universal wants to make a franchise out of this movie. Luckily for us, this move isn't made like that. It is a complete story not a set-up for future ones like the first Spiderman. Go to this movie and you will have fun. Unless you are a stuffy movie snob that feels that a movie must be moving, touching, and/or thought provoking to be good. Have a swell day."

","""Van Helsing"" starts off with a sort of homage to the Universal monster films of the 1930s, with improved visual effects. You'll have to see it yourself to know what i mean. But it also sets the tone for an action film that rarely lets up. In a good way that is. Hugh Jackman might have a Harrison Ford-like future if he wants. Imagine a good looking guy, who can handle the big budget action films, but with more depth of character than Ford has ever brought.<br/><br/>(Possible Spoiler)<br/><br/>This Van Helsing, not to be confused with the better known Abraham, is a 007 for the late 19th century. Fighting larger than life villains (Mr. Hyde, The Wolfman, etc.) under the auspices of an organization (the Catholic Church) protecting the world from disaster. Only now he must fight his deadliest enemy, Dracula and his minions.<br/><br/>Despite the length (over 2hrs 15min), the pace rarely falters to blandness. Credit this to director Stephen Sommers. Seems more confident in his creative choices then in The Mummy (the less said about the sequel, the better). Granted, Kate Beckinsale did nothing in this film that Rachel Weisz couldn't do as well, so maybe a little money could have been saved. And like The Mummy, Sommers needs a comic sidekick. In this case, David Wenham as the cowardly friar making weapons like Q to help out Van Helsing. Wenham and Jackman's interplay goes well, as they rise above their dialogue. No such luck between Jackman and Beckinsale.<br/><br/>But this isn't an actor's or a writer's piece; this is an ILM piece, and boy do they come through. The effects are a standout, with the best computer-generated morphing/transformation sequences i've seen in quite a while. Thumbs up for the sound effects and editing crews as well. The formula seems familiar after you leave the theater. But while you're watching, you don't care. You're just enjoying the ride. Like i said in the summary, check your brain at the door and have fun. 7 out of 10."

","Van Helsing, one of My most anticipated movies and it was everything that I thought it would be and more! I think the film is a great one! Everyone one who is in this movie acted very good. Hugh Jackman was great as Van Helsing. He was very believable! Kate Beckinsale also was good and her accent was cool. Richard Roxburgh was excellent and he arguably had the best performance and his look as Dracula was neat. Shuler Hensley was great as Frankenstein's Monster! Samuel West was also great as Dr. Frankenstein and it was outstanding how much he looked like Colin Clive! Kevin J. O'Connor was also great as Igor. Will Kemp was good as the Werewolf. The three Brides played by Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca, and Josie Maran were excellent and they have a lot of screen time. It is amazing how they look in their vampire forms! Robbie Coltrane was good as Mr. Hyde! Also in good performances are Alun Armstrong and David Wenham. I just couldn't believe how great this movie is. The beginning of it is incredible! The sound is spectacular and I can't recall a film with sound like this! The musical score by Alan Silvestri is phenomenal! Arguably the greatest score he has ever written and in My opinion one of the greatest scores ever! The special effects are awesome and in My opinion everything looks real! The directing by Stephen Sommers is great! I think Van Helsing is one of the best movies and truly one of the most exciting films. If you like the cast mentioned above, love Sommer's The Mummy films, and want to see some incredible action involving Van Helsing, Dracula, Werewolves, Frankenstein's Monster, Mr. Hyde, Dracula's Brides, and more then I strongly recommend that you do what I did and buy this excellent movie today!"

","There's not a lot I can say that is positive about this movie. The only thing I liked were some of the werewolf scenes because they didn't look totally like a video game unlike Mr. Jeckyl, who looked ridiculous. Hugh Jackman must have signed to do this movie solely for the paycheck since he's usually in good to descent films. Kate Beckinsale chose to do this even after the stupid Underworld. And as most people have already said, her accent was horrible. Dracula was way-over acted. It was one of the worst Dracula's that's been on film. It's like the director couldn't decide if he wanted his Dracula to be comical or taken seriously.<br/><br/>Part of the plot involves Dracula needing Frankenstein to use as a power source to bring his flying ""children"" to life. Those were some of the stupidest monsters I've seen. And his brides were terrible CGI when they were shown flying also.<br/><br/>As for the action/fighting scenes: they were terrible. Most of them were beyond unrealistic. Many of the scenes involving Anna, showed her jumping around almost like Ang Lee's Hulk. And she does all this amazing kung fu and falls 10 stories but never gets hurt.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Terrible action, abysmal story, mostly stupid special effects. Basically a waste of a large sum of money."

","This has to one of the most colossal, audience insulting messes of all time, worse, even, than Transformers 4 in that regard.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers follows up his spectacular job on the Mummy with a movie that looked so damn good on paper, but... well, let's try balance, the good stuff...<br/><br/>The opening feels pretty darn good, the black and white intro the frankenstein story. Sure, it's not up to the ancient Hamunaptra intro from the Mummy, but it does a good job and the actors involved sell this oh so well. We move on to Robbie Coltrane voicing Mr hyde, and whilst the Hyde CGI is pretty poor, Coltrane does a great job voicing the villain.<br/><br/>After that, we're getting a little vaguer, but... Roxburgh was genius casting as Dracula, after his scene-mastication in Moulin Rouge, this was slightly more subdued, but still oh-so effective and then there were the brides, both in their cgi and *ahem* more fleshy forms they gave the movie a little... something.<br/><br/>Now, the bad. Beckinsale is about as charismatic as a bag of carrots although she does prove consistently good at running in heels. I don;t know exactly what that says about her, but when it came down to any confrontation between her and the brides (especially Aleera), for the only time in my life I was on Team Vampire.<br/><br/>Jackman was fair, but largely felt like he was on autopilot, he needs something meatier to draw a performance from than 'moody vampire-hunter'. he wasn't terrible, it's just that he could have been anybody right here.<br/><br/>Now the plot... I'm quite happy to suspend my disbelief a little for a movie, especially one about monsters, steampunk science and magic, but this was exceptionally dumb and the plot had holes big enough that you could easily fit in castles, Dracula, Frankenstein, Argh and Disney, with adequate space for a shopping mall with plenty of parking, a football stadium and an expansive amusement park based on the theme of 'dumb ideas'. We're somehow expected to believe that travel in one direction takes days, whilst going the other way takes hours, or that a portcullis that drops to water level will somehow prevent humans passing through a passage of water deep enough to allow a boat to pass through. Sorry, this is just dumb.<br/><br/>Then there are the toxic ewoks, the randomly awful gravedigger, the vampires who are considered darn-near all-powerful but unable to kill someone who's primary skill seems to be running away, yet without the skill and determination of Rincewind and the sheer awfulness of... well, most of it.<br/><br/>Sorry, I tried to like it at release. I even tried to rehabilitate it a couple of years later when my wife went through her Hugh Jackman phase. So, when I chose it randomly in the run up to Halloween this year I figured 'one last chance'. I was right. Last chance. I like the Mummy. I like the Mummy Returns. I'll even sit through the Dragon Emperor, but this movie just fails on so many levels. Bad acting, bad CGI, lazy directing, too many things walking on walls for no reason and that awful werwolf transformation.<br/><br/>Sorry, sorry, sorry.

"mnpollio","4","2","5","12 October 2014"," Sounds promising on paper; far less so in execution
","Director Stephen Sommers was fresh off the success of The Mummy films, when he apparently had the inspiration to start a new franchise centering on the legendary Van Helsing character. Fanboys everywhere began imagining what older actor would take the part. The announcement then came that hunky Hugh Jackman would play the role of a younger Van Helsing, who would not just hunt vampires but a variety of monsters from the Universal stable. Enthusiasm was through the roof...then the film came out and the end result was like air being let out of a balloon.<br/><br/>Jackman does indeed play Van Helsing, who is an assassin on behalf of the Vatican crossing the globe offing monsters. The film opens with him taking down Mr. Hyde and running afoul of the law. Then he is dispatched to Transylvania to deal with Dracula and his brides that are trying to procreate. This all has something to with Frankenstein's Monster and a werewolf, but if you can figure out how then you are doing better than I am.<br/><br/>The film boasts a strong cast who are often not given anything of worth to do, an array of special effects, and a frenetic pace that will hopefully distract from the fact that the story is an overstuffed mess. The film would have been far more better to have focused on one or two monsters instead of the bunch we have here. We get Dracula and his three brides, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man, Mr. Hyde and a villainous Igor (badly played by Kevin O'Connor). Frankenstein is never adequately worked into the plot and the Wolf Man seems an afterthought. Along with these characters, the film also must make room for Kate Beckinsale's sexy tough-as-nails gypsy co-hort and David Wenham as a dorky friar aiding our hero. It is just too much.<br/><br/>It also does not help that the film comes across like a wall of noise. There is never much sense or fun or charm to anything we see. The non-stop visual effects are a real mixed bag. The effects involving Dracula and his brides are fine, but Mr Hyde looks like a cross between Gumby and The Hulk and the werewolf effects are embarrassing. Why is it that 30 years ago we were getting state-of-the-art werewolf effects in The Howling and An American Werewolf in London, but these latest CGI werewolf effects look like crap? Also, the plot never makes it clear why the Vatican forces Van Helsing to work on the wrong side of the law when writs from them would instantaneously give him the cache to do whatever need be done.<br/><br/>Of the cast, Will Kemp as the werewolf and Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein may as well not be in it for all of the focus they get. Roxburgh does little but snarl as Dracula. Wenham has some amusing moments and Beckinsale has never been sexier.<br/><br/>I am a huge Hugh Jackman fan. I have had the privilege to see him in films, on stage and in person, and the man oozes personality and charisma from every pore. In Van Helsing, he is completely underwhelming. He has been handed a role that could have been filled by a stunt man without noticing a difference. Van Helsing as written has no character traits, no humor, no charisma, no history and no presence. He stands unsmiling, with a variety of weapons, and grunts or recites lines in a one-note grizzled tough guy voice. The actor that humanized Wolverine and became a star with X-Men is apparently on vacation here. He does get to do a lot of running, jumping, climbing, falling and swinging. He dons a loincloth in one scene, but alas no nudity to compensate for the absence of anything else.<br/><br/>Much could be forgiven if the film was dumb fun (like The Mummy), but it is not. It is loud, annoying, incoherent, squanders a great leading man and promising supporting cast, contains dreadful werewolf effects and ultimately is little more than a big waste of time."

","Van Helsing is a mediocre movie with a decent storyline and a good cast.The movie is certainly a disappointed,a Van Helsing movie with Hugh Jackman in the title role immediately sounds like a great new franchise,but unfortunately so many aspects of this movie were done wrong.I felt like the writers just tried to throw in any famous horror characters they could think of,from Dracula,Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein,it would have been so much better if it just focused on Dracula,and certainly would have been better without that ridiculous werewolf side story.The CGI in this film is very unrealistic,you could tell these characters were animated and it didn't feel like they were communicating with the real actors at all.Also the humour isn't very subtle in this movie,I also appreciate a bit of comedy in an action movie but it was too common in this and was rarely genuinely funny,the character of Carl was definitely only there for comic relief,but I didn't laugh at a single thing he said.Van Helsing has its moments,but is overall not a very good movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. <br/><br/>The Vatican's star monster hunter is sent to Transylvania to help a princess find and kill Dracula.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Hugh Jackman"
"vicvonfate","Null","2","5","14 January 2012"," Just Bad
","I know you don't go to this type of film looking for a deep plot or even a believable story but you at least expect coherent entertainment. From the opening fight scene with Mr. Hyde through the end of the film, there wasn't one single moment when you bought in to the CGI chaos that was depicted on the screen. When severely underdeveloped characters are flying around and defying every law of physics, you're never allowed to get involved in the movie on any level other then the ""cool cartoon"" level (and quite frankly very few of the jerky CGI cartoon creature scenes were that cool). I could literally list the WAY over the top, unbelievable cartoon moments but that would fill up an entire page. The sad part is that most of the CGI monsters looked really fake. From Hyde to the baby vampires to the vampire women, they all looked extremely cheesy. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are exceptional actors but were so stranded by this script and by the stunts that it almost hurt to watch them floundering on screen from one fake backdrop to another. The hambone that played Dracula threw so much over the top cheese at EVERY single line he delivered that my arteries hardened just watching him. To call this film a disappointment would be an understatement. I was greatly looking forward to it because of the concept, the cast and the obviously huge budget. It's such a shame that they threw this much talent and this much money behind a script written by someone's pre-teen child. I guess I should be asking myself why would I expect anything remotely intelligent from a movie that was directed by the director of The Mummy & Mummy Returns? I'd say next time I'll know better but there won't be a next time for me sitting through any more of this guy's movies.<br/><br/>Spoilers.. Kate's character spends most of her time getting smacked around, dangling from great heights and often falling from those heights but bounces up with barely a scratch. Yet, she gets humped for two seconds by the Van Wolfman and dies? What was the story with her and her brother? I know they were the last royalty but I think they were TOO close. Wasn't that them making out in Heaven there at the end? How can any director rationalize shooting and producing the idiotic things that occurred in this movie? Fun action is one thing but one stupid, cheesy and over the top CGI moment after the other is quite another thing. Van Helsing jumping all around the cathedral fighting a Mr. Hyde that doesn't bleed was video-gamesque in every way. Apparently, all the people in Kate's little town do is stand around in their courtyard with farm equipment ready to beat strangers and be food for vampires. They were upset when one died so obviously they weren't looking to fight back. What was the deal with the hambone Dracula's master plan? He has no emotions so he wants offspring? I nearly laughed out loud when he says he doesn't feel anything yet he delivers this line in ANGER and then he LAUGHS. Van Helsing was the one who killed him when he was mortal but he treats him like a long lost friend and carries on a nice plodding conversation when Van Helsing first confronts him? By the way, why is Van Helsing 600 years old? Because he's the left arm of God? Huh? Another laugh out loud moment happened when it clearly wasn't meant to. As Kate swings like Tarzan from hundreds of feet in the air from a castle window, Friar Goober flings her a syringe (the only way to save Van Wolfman) in a driving rainstorm. What results is a nice catch and the movie's 50th ""roll your eyes"" moment. The fact that Friar Goober just walks across the remnants of the bridge moments later makes it even more laughable. Every single time one of these vampire supercreatures has the edge they stop to talk, gloat, or toy with Kate or Van Jackman. Even Dracula stops to give his last live action cheesy moment as the moon goes behind the clouds and Van Wolfman is helpless. OY. This was just bad at every turn. You know they're over doing the fake CGI when in the middle of an action sequence I was more fixated on Kate Beckinsale's perfect behind then on any of the ""spectacular"" CGI shots going on around her. Yes, she's extremely gorgeous but I'm not that big of a horndog. I just was tired at looking at silly CGI that offered nothing new. Hugh Jackman had better shelve this franchise and get back to the clever franchise that's made him a star. The X-Men franchise is everything Van Helsing isn't. Hugh can play a hero with memory problems that can kick ass there but he can do it with a real character and a real director."

Before I sold over a hundred DVDs to a pawn shop, I copied this one, cos I wanted to watch it one more time.<br/><br/>And now I am sorry I sold my copy! This is no serious horror movie... This is pure FUN! Universal must have decided to give Sommers the green light to handle ALL of the Universal monsters, and rather than doing it in several films, he wraps them all up in one great, complete package.<br/><br/>Sure these Universal stories could have been made each into singular films of their own, but only Sommers could have brought Van Helsing face to face with The Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, and even Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde.<br/><br/>People expecting something else, totally forgot who directed this piece: Stephen Sommers, whose earlier treatment of The Mummy blew our minds- WHAT did they expect? Of course Sommers had to reach for the sky. It is not this film that was done badly, it was the public reaction to it, and if you reach back, Bush had just won a second term, so the public was in no good mood- Whereas the first Mummy was released during the height of an economy boom, and the second, just before housing balloon popped, in 2004, it was simply not the right time to release a film as light as this.<br/><br/>This film is not just over the top, it is WAY over the top... And because of that it is rather funny, perhaps there was too much humour in the film, The Mummies had several serious moments, this had few. I believe that because this film was dine as a period piece, people expected Sommers to stay within the realm of the technologies we knew existed in those times... But Sommers instead, transposed several modern ideas into the story, and uses them... Maybe people thought this was too unbelievable... But I think Sommer's idea was, since this was a secret society of evil vanquishers sponsored by the highly secretive Vatican, Van Helsing had access to things like Rapid Fire Arrows and the little ""Volcano in a Bottle"" gag. Since the Vatican are huge secret-hoarders, it is not too much of a limb to make yourself believe that Van Jackman had access to these things.<br/><br/>Jackman is what makes the film so enjoyable, Between Jackman and David Wenham, they had me in stitches for most of the film. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely beautiful, I have not seen her in any films for some time, but she is absolutely fabulous in this. And of course we have ""Benny"" from The Mummy, Kevin O'Conner, as Igor, and a great face, Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's Monster.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this was mid 2005, now six years later, I can laugh at it, and enjoy it like Sommers wanted us all to do in the first place. Since this film, Sommers has produced a 3rd Mummy film, directed by Rob Cohen, but even with a different director, that film is flush with Sommer style gags.<br/><br/>If anything, this film was too ambitious, but even so, I hated it, but now I like it a lot."

","I'll save you the trouble of watching this movie in two words: DORKULA LIVES!<br/><br/>This is one of the worst things I've seen, EVER. It knocked John Carpenter's Vampires out of the #1 spot on my list of Worst Vampire Movies I've Ever Seen ...and I watched Dracula 3000! This movie has a good cast. I am amazed that there is so little good acting. It's been a long time since anything I saw in a film had me wanting to claw out my eyes. Half the reason I didn't was that doing so would require me to stop covering my ears. The dialogue was dreadful, but not nearly so dreadful as the cringingly stereotypical fake accents sported by half the cast.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale's character is supposed to be a gypsy, but neither she nor her brother not her entourage dress, act or seem to think like Roma. The word is just tossed in there. It would have been much better, I think, to refer to them as Romanian nobles and leave it at that. It doesn't help that she looks like she's dressed up as a pirate for Halloween.<br/><br/>Most of this movie had me wondering just how stupid the writers think their viewers are, but the ending topped it all. Since there are probably people out there who would enjoy this movie -- though I have little idea why -- I won't give details on it, but let's just say I was worried that the Care Bears were going to show up.<br/><br/>Redeeming points: Frankenstein is done fairly well, as are the patterns of movement on the vampires as they fly. This movie has the best werewolf visuals I've ever seen. There are also hints of a good story going on in the background with the mystery of Van Helsing's unknown past, but instead of playing these up as a real subplot, this movie buries them under piles and piles of some of the stupidest writing I've ever seen."

Richard Roxborough's, camp as a field of tents, performance then lead me to believe that it was going to be a re-imagining of Carry on Screaming.<br/><br/>As for supporting performances, special mention must be made of Alun Armstrong's accent - scary although it has to be said that it was not as unconvincing as the CGI effects during the aerial attack by the brides of Dracula.<br/><br/>If you want to see Kate Beckinsale in a vampire flick watch Underworld.

It seems that Hollywood loves to release these ""trick"" films where you expect to see some amazing horror/action flick but instead you get a goofy slap stick mess like Van Helsing. The PG-13 rating is your first warning as Director Stephen Sommers displays his true flamboyance as he uses almost every classic monster to tell this mess of a story in a toned down goofy fashion.<br/><br/>Although it advertises ""Awesome Horror"" Van Helsing features almost no blood in the entire film, Sommers is such a bad director it isn't even funny, the use of CGI for the monsters and special effects is down right incompetent, the portrayal of Dracula and his brides is so badly acted you wont believe your ears. And the script to get all these monsters together in one film is far from clever because when you finally learn the story and its twists, you will wonder what idiot approved the Script. Stephen Sommers clearly cant be stopped, his next projects include a ""Flash Gordon"" adaptation. His clear flamboyance and incompetence as a director can no longer be avoided.

"trryancy","4","2","5","14 April 2005"," Requires a high tolerance for stupidity
","The only reason I rated this film a four instead of a three is because it held my attention. I may not have been bored, but I was, however, extremely annoyed, almost to the point of being offended. It felt as if the filmmakers gave their their audience no credit for intelligence whatsoever, confident that if they give us enough big-name stars, splashy special effects, PG-13 sexiness, and fast food promo tie-ins that we will gladly shell out $8 bucks for admission and $5 for popcorn and go home happy, without offering us anything of actual quality.<br/><br/>Essentially, Van Helsing is a cartoonish genre blend of sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, and comedy. Yet, the real comedy in the film is unintentional; some points in the film are just so dumb you can't help but laugh. Why is Kate Beckinsale dressed like a cross between a matador and a dominatrix? Why dose she go out to fight vampires wearing high heels and heavy jewelry? How is it that she gets thrown across the room several times over without ever messing up her hair? Why does the entire region of Transylvania appear to consist of a single village? How is it that Beckinsale and Jackman fall into a river, yet five minutes later are completely dry? Why is a woman is the most remote part part of Eastern Europe in the 1880's wearing a pair of crack-riding spandex pants? How is it that Jekyll/Hyde doesn't bleed when he gets an entire arm lopped off? It seems these are not considered important details by the film makers, who assume viewers are either not going to notice or not going to care. Well, I noticed, and I cared, but that's just me.<br/><br/>On that note, they also take huge liberties with historical accuracy, right from the very beginning of the film. Van Helsing the creature- killer refers to Mr. Hyde as a ""deranged sociopath"", a term which had not yet been invented in the 1880's, before the practice of psychoanalysis was known. Not long afterward, another character refers to Istanbul, which back then was still called Constantinople. Throughout the film, Van Helsing liberally sips absinthe from a flask. Not many people have seen absinthe before, but it is a cloudy, key-lime green color. In the film, it is transparent and bright emerald green, like Nyquil. Furthermore, absinthe was served in an almost ritualistic manner that involves burning a sugar cube over the glass before imbibing; only a rube would go around sipping from a flask. It is also mildly hallucinogenic and even quite toxic in large amounts, which is why it's now illegal. Van Helsing would have been a complete idiot to go around swigging it like it's Red Bull.<br/><br/>Although the film uses classic horror films as a point of reference, there's really nothing scary about it at all. Practically every classic horror story ever known is mishmashed into the plot, no matter how briefly; all that's missing is 'The Invisible Man' and 'The Mask of Fu Manchu', and that's probably just because the writers couldn't think of a way to fit them in. Some people may call this ambitious; I think it's just silly.<br/><br/>If none of these issues bother you, go ahead, rent it; everyone is entitled to turn off their brain for a couple hours a day. But if you consider cogent plot lines, character development, intelligent writing and a cohesive narrative indispensable, you might want to skip this."

I'm not sure that the scenes that left me almost literally rolling on the floor in tears of hysterical laughter were actually meant to be funny at all. There are some familiar names involved in the supporting cast, who were all brilliant in other movies but fall far short in this one, and the cgi work is erratic at best. In fact, I can't imagine how a post-Gollum movie could turn out something as lousy as the disgustingly amateurish Mr.Hyde. The plot is ridiculous, the supposedly clever comments and catchphrase-wannabes are lame beyond description. There's nothing to recommend this to anyone, unless you like being tortured by a really bad movie. Avoid this one like you would a huge flock of winged demons!

","This movie has all except a good story. All fans of Dracula knows the magic of van Helsing. In Coppola's movie he is there when Dracula resents God, and becomes an undead. The doctor pursues Dracula for the 400 years until he has the final encounter in London when the count goes there looking for his life's,and death's, love. Taken from this scenario van Helsing could have been a very good movie about the hunt for the master vampire during those 400 years. But obviously they have saved the money from the story writing and chosen to go with special effects and half naked beautiful women. Mixing to much of modern action and modern weapons, looking rusty old fashioned,in to a medieval scene is in my opinion not helping this movie. Also it must be said that after Oldman as charismatic dangerous Dracula(In Coppola's movie) it just will not do with a plain nice looking ""James Bond"" type for a Dracula no matter how long his hair and bad his words. At best Dracula should be Oldman, but at least they should use an actor with a ""sting"" to do the role."

"The_Void","3","2","6","12 January 2005"," Classic horror writers, actors and directors turn in their graves
","The idea behind this film comes off the back of this recent trend of blending together different stories to make one lesser story; the stories in question being, principally; those of Dracula, Frankenstein and The Wolf Man. From this premise, you can't expect 'greatness', but you can expect a fun romp and, suffice to say, this film doesn't even deliver on that front; as it's action-fuelled monster antics get tiresome very quickly indeed. Stephen Sommers has basically done what he did with The Mummy, in that he's taken an existing story and added CGI effects, only this time the result is a miserable mess of a film with absolutely terrible CGI and a complete lack of intrigue from the characters and the plot line. The muddled plot basically follows Count Dracula, who has decided to enlist the help of Baron Frankenstein, along with a werewolf to help him in his plot to do...something. Enter Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman); the intelligent (or not, in this case) monster hunter that goes on Dracula's tail along with an irritating priest and a Princess (played by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale) and what follows is what should be an entertaining monster mash, but what is actually a dull, cliché ridden, action film with little or nothing of what made it's influences great.<br/><br/>Dracula has been turned from a malevolent conglomeration of evil into a comic book villain. Frankenstein's Monster has taken way too much of the emotional side that Karloff portrayed so brilliantly in 'Bride of Frankenstein' and is little more than a pathetic mess of a character. The way that the werewolves are integrated into the story is actually quite good, but that's shot down in flames by the fact that the wolves themselves look ridiculous. Whoever decided that CGI was the best way to do effects wants shooting; it looks rubbish, and the only reason I can think of why it's used is to save valuable time that would have been used creating real effects. If you want evidence of how NOT to do special effects, see the Mr Hyde sequence towards the start. Absolutely awful. The title character is nothing like the character that Bram Stoker wrote for him. I don't even know why they chose to use the name 'Van Helsing' anyway, most of the target audience will have never have heard of him and since he's nothing like the character that the likes of Peter Cushing and Anthony Hopkins portrayed so well, they might as well have simply made a new monster hunter for the film. Then I wouldn't have been bothered about him being called 'Gabriel' instead of 'Abraham'. Kate Beckinsale could have been the film's saving grace, but even Mrs sweetness herself isn't herself in this awful film. I don't know if it's the terrible accent, the rubbish haircut or the daft outfits; but she's nothing like the ultra sexy character she played in the surprisingly good 'Underworld'.<br/><br/>Basically, what we have here is a film that was made by a man that thought he had an idea that was good enough to carry a film on it's own. The complete lack of ideas and reliance on changes to the original characters shows that, and this is a very sad motion picture indeed. You may have gone into this expecting something of a tribute to the great horror classics, but this film features little in the way of horror at all. If you ever wanted to see a film that showed beyond doubt that CGI isn't the way to create good effects, this is the film to see. But since you don't want to see a film like that, you have no reason to see 'Van Helsing'. My advice is to avoid this trash at all costs."

","Sorry, but this is just all over the place. A potpourri of myths and legends loosely connected with the famous vampire hunter that just don't gel at all. Doctor Jekyll, Mr Hyde, Victor Frankenstein and his monster all vie with Count Dracula for the attention of a really rather lacklustre Hugh Jackman in the title role. Kate Beckinsale sort-of recreates her ""Underworld"" role as she becomes his kick-ass sidekick. It's fairly action-packed but the scenes go on for far too long, the script is cheesy, the CGI just isn't great and the attempts at humour don't work well either."

Sure you have the female hero with a cringe worthy accent and stuff like that, but who cares? It's a pretty solid action adventure fantasy movie with diffrent monsters from diffrent classics mixed. And the specialFX is pretty solid aswell as the scenery is breathtaking at times. With some small tweaks here and there this could aswell been a Castlevania movie. You find almost everything from the Castlevania games in it, and would it have gone this route i think people would have liked it even more.
Insert Simon Belmont with the vampyre killer and add some more fight scenes and uped the horror a small bit and it would have been Castlevania the movie.
Instead we have Van helsing with a forgotten past that works like a early James Bond agent for the Vatican church. Like James Bond he has his Q in the shape of a priest instead.
Some parts of this movie somehow makes me feel like im watching a movie from the past, when fantasy movies like Krull or even Conan the barbarien did their own thing. And it succeds to entertain eventho it isent a Classic like the ones i mention, and some parts are more dull then others after a viewing or two. So an interesting mix of monsters and a diffrent take on the Van Helsing/Dracula story that for sure isent as bad as the score here might give away."

","Van Helsing: 7 out of 10: The titular Van Helsing finds himself sent on a mission to Transylvania to hunt Dracula and prevent a family of Gypsies from being trapped in purgatory.<br/><br/>This is a very big film that is at times overstuffed with action cliffhangers and cameos. It has Dragula, Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, Dracula's brides, Dracula's babies, Dracula's Oompa Loompas, other vampires, other werewolves, gypsies with torches, Victor Frankenstein, Dr. Jeykyll, Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing, Igor, and Kate Beckinsale.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is overall a fun time that is appropriate monster mayhem for the whole family. The film suffers from some teensy tiny flaws that take it down a notch from writer/director Stephen Sommers previous Mummy films. But like that very thin mint fed to Mr. Creosote in the Meaning of Life any one of these could cause the entire experience to explode. What follows is a non-comprehensive list of teeny tiny Van Helsing issues.<br/><br/>A: Dracula is kind of well... lame. Richard Roxburgh's take on the count does eventually grow on one with his tongue firmly planted in cheek. This is as much his movie as it is Van Helsing's. One wonders what the movie could have done with Gary Oldman or even Tom Cruise in the role. Roxburgh simply doesn't have enough menace and he seems more of a put-upon husband with three wives than an actual bad guy.<br/><br/>B: There is a special effects failure from which the movie has trouble recovering. About two-thirds of the way through the movie Van Helsing jumps a chasm with a carriage being pulled by four horses. A very large chasm. You know the bridge is out kind of thing. The kind of chasm that the General Lee would balk at jumping. It is ridiculous on paper and looks even worse on screen.<br/><br/>C: In fact, the whole movie seems to have a problem with physics. No one seems to have mass and even allowing that Van Helsing, Dracula, and the werewolves are indestructible it doesn't explain why Kate Beckinsale isn't dead like thirty times from falls alone.<br/><br/>D: The movie also has a problem keeping itself grounded. Transylvania seems to have nothing but sheer cliffs and the moon is full every three days. Everything is a cliffhanger and the film never takes a moment to breathe in its over two hours running time lest it not be able to fit in one more set piece, cliffhanger, or character reveal.<br/><br/>There is more good than bad overall, however. With various characterizations such as Dracula's brides and Frankenstein being particular standouts. And while one can nitpick for days (Why exactly does Dracula even want children?) a fun time is in store from a live-action cartoon point of view.<br/><br/>And now for something completely different. Since this is an overstuffed movie why not an overstuffed review.<br/><br/>First of all, I know that Video Game adaptations were box office poison n 2004 (and not much better now) but certainly, the makers of Van Helsing had to realize at some point they were making an almost perfect Castlevania movie. Change Kate Beckinsale's last name from Valerious to Belmont and change nothing else and one does have a scene for scene recreation of Castlevania.
,
The good folks in charge of the Universal Monsters clearly didn't look at the response to this movie before starting their Dark Universe. I mean at least this one had a successful Mummy movie proceeding it... Cough Cough...<br/><br/>
Too much FX, not enough characterization, and it never takes a breath. A fun, if exhausting, ride Van Helsing holds its own overall."
"ivko","5","1","2","5 November 2018"," kind of a mess
","There are some interesting takes on the vampire legend in this movie, but unfortunately they are buried beneath confusing plot twists, problems with tone, and a script that is about 30 minutes too long. The movie features Hugh Jackman as the legendary vampire hunter Van Helsing, but a quasi-immortal version of Helsing that can't remember his past except in flashes of nightmares. Kate Beckinsale plays Anna Valerious, an action hero in her own right whose family has a history with Dracula.<br/><br/>Also making appearances in the film are Dr. Jeckle/Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein and his creation, and the Wolf man. The plot revolves around a confusing scheme by Dracula to harvest the science of Frankenstein to become a baby daddy and Van Helsing attempting to release Anna's ancestors into heaven, and also werewolves for whatever reason. There's also a separate plot teased about how Van Helsing was somehow responsible for creating Dracula, although as far as I can tell a few allusions is all the movie delivers, perhaps because they expected to get sequels that never materialized.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is tone. For the first 30 minutes I literally couldn't tell if the movie was supposed to be a horror thriller or a slapstick parody. Dramatic scenes will be suddenly put on hold while characters crack jokes with a wink to the audience before picking right back up with drama. I think this was a conscious choice, kind of like they want to say ""hey we get it, this is silly stuff."" But instead of coming off as hip, it mostly just serves to drain any dramatic tension they were building.<br/><br/>The other issue is time. Good lord this is a long film for a horror movie. The extra length is used to add several additional meaningless battles in the middle of the movie that just go nowhere. They could have clipped Anna's brother out completely and just brought Van Helsing to his battle with Dracula sooner and the movie would have flowed so much better.<br/><br/>In the end, I felt like there were some interesting moments here, but I was too frustrated waiting for them to get to the movie's climax to appreciate them. Instead I just felt like I must have missed a previous movie that explained all of the backstory the characters referenced in this film but never explained."

","Hugh Jackman has had his fair share of films people always enjoy. The Prestige (2006) and Prisoners (2013) are of a couple that Jackman is well respected for. With this, Jackman has had a steady career of being cast in various films. By far the one everyone will remember him for though is his portrayal of Logan AKA Wolverine from X-Men (2000) and the numerous sequels and spin-offs that came after. There have only been a handful of features that Jackman probably thinks people shouldn't bother seeing. By now one of his highest choices would probably be Movie 43 (2013), which received extremely negative reviews. Before this though, Jackman was in another film that isn't exactly high end either. For that case it belongs to this film, an action fantasy movie that is cluttered with several things that make it a bore to sit through. It isn't the absolute worst but it gets very tiresome over time. There just needed to be less of what was present and perhaps it might've felt smoother.<br/><br/>Picking up where the animated prequel left off after chasing Mr. Hyde, Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is assigned to go after Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) who's after an ancient family bloodline lead by Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). Turns out Drac wants the secret of life created in Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley). After the financial success of The Mummy Returns (2001), Stephen Sommers came back for this project as the writer/director. This is probably where most of the problem lies. After the waves he made with his mummy franchise, Sommers just went on auto pilot, making action fantasy spectacles that became less and less engaging. Looking back I know my review to G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009) needs a re-adjustment because after watching this, the same tropes are fairly much the same in there too. All the plots to the writing (whether main or sub) contain numerous genre clichés that are tired and simply uninteresting.<br/><br/>Before the leads even physically meet it is foreshadowed that Van Helsing will fall for Anna. That's no spoiler, it's plainly obvious. Even the plot itself is overused. Why must every movie that involves Frankenstein's monster have it be ""the key"" to whatever the villain is planning? There's also unexplained mythology about several parts to the plot. Dracula's weakness and Van Helsing's backstory largely are just hinted at. Other than that there's no in-depth look; so why even bother? Another problem is pacing. This movie is over 2 hours long and felt painfully slow, as if there wasn't even a script to begin with. Plus, the plot dealing with Frankenstein's monster isn't introduced until around the halfway point. I, Frankenstein (2014) had the same overall plot, was a half an hour shorter and managed to make the viewing experience feel somewhat more enjoyable because of its trimmed running time. Here it just feels like a slow treck through action scene after action scene.<br/><br/>The last issue to this creature feature is the cast. Jackman and Beckinsale are probably the only two who play it straight. Jackman was the better half more because he has better quips for certain situations. Other than these two people, every other actor is hammy beyond belief. It's one thing if a single actor hams it up more than everyone else, but when the whole cast is being over the top, it just feels overly dramatic and in the most silliest of ways. Carl (David Wenham), Van Helsing's assistant is nothing more than a sidekick. Will Kemp is useless as Anna's brother. Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor (who looks like he has John Hurt's makeup from The Elephant Man (1980)) is wasted because it's shown he has opinions,...but that's ignored. Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's monster is cool looking but does a lot of screaming. The same goes for Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. He by far chews the most scenery; MORE than Richard Grant from Rocky V (1990). It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>These are the positives to the film and they do make the viewing better but still not decent enough. Robbe Coltrane voicing Mr. Hyde was nice hearing again. The action, although too abundant, was mostly entertaining. Even though by today's standards compared to 2004, even the CGI looked fairly good. This goes for the action sequences or the slower moving shots. The cinematography shot by Allen Daviau looks adequate too. Daviau was also the DP for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983) and Empire of the Sun (1987). Composing the film score to this action fantasy movie was Alan Silvestri. Turns out for this score, Silvestri does not stick to his usual sound. Here he incorporates some synth into his motifs. He also arranged multiple themes for various characters and scene locations. Now if only his full score would be released, that'd be nice. If you can ignore all the bad things mentioned before you might enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Action junkies and Hugh Jackman fans would probably get the most benefit from this film. It isn't terrible but it has enough issues, with its painful pacing, overzealous actors and foggy writing. The action, music and visuals are good but that's what most Stephen Sommers' films have in them. It's rather boring at times."

It might be weird for you to this movie mix up some of the old horror icons like vampires, Frankenstein, but it's not that bad. Some guy told me this is a steam-punk movie, i don't see why, except the weapons, but its not like City of Lost Children, or any other steam-punk movie, its just played at the past, with some fiction weapons.

"Daniele-sa","8","1","2","1 December 2009"," Van Helsing is a good Film.
","Even if I've read so many bad comments about this Film, I'm able to say that in Italy it was a success. The plot is very original, and is simple to follow, therefore it is in a way different from the other films about vampires, werewolves and ""monsters"". Obsviously there's always the same theme: fight between good and evil, but I've to admit the locations are really weird and the film has - in my humble opinion - an high level starring, apart from some bit players. Anyways, I saw the film twice: the first time in 2005 and the second one last year, and it was still exciting, I enjoyed so much watching it, and if anybody asked me to spend a night watching it again, I would: it's always a pleasure to watch this film, it's a mix of adventure, action and legendary creatures (Dracula, for example). So, if you're looking for an original and simple film, which has the mythical or the magical element and you like action and fantasy this one's for you. Of course this is not a colossal, but I think that it's incredible how it has such a low rating. I can firmly assort that many films which are marked as awesome or outstanding - I don't wanna mention them - are rather worse than this one."
"Sirus_the_Virus","8","1","2","12 September 2009"," I liked it.
","I have seen Van Helsing many, many times. I like it a lot more than a lot of other people. I did as a matter of fact find one thing about the film silly. I think the fact that these 3 monsters would be in one film is kind of weird, and Frankenstein is not supposed to be talking, he just walks around moaning. Frankenstein is the worst thing about this film. His dialogue is irritating and I wouldn't be trying to save him. Other than that, I liked the film quite a bit. It's quite a bit of fun. It got so little credit but I give it a ton of credit because of many things. I actually liked this film more than Steven Sommers's last film, The Mummy Returns. I think that Van Helsing is a lot of interesting fun.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays the title character himself. If you remember from Dracula, they hired Van Helsing to slay Dracula. Because Van Helsing is a monster hunter. Kate Beckinsale joins along for the ride as Anna Valarious, who's brother was recently turned into The Wolfman. The two of them travel down to Transylvania to stop Dracula, who is using Frankenstein's research for something evil. I think that Van Helsing is a lot of fun so I give it a thumbs up. Perhaps I am being to kind, or perhaps everyone else is retarded."
"neil-476","8","1","2","4 August 2009"," Fun, geddit?
","Of all the different genres in the world of movies, fantasy is the one which should never take itself too seriously. When it does it becomes incredibly po-faced, and the old enjoyability quotient reduces exponentially.<br/><br/>Van Helsing remembers, throughout every second of its running time, that it is supposed to be fun. From the opening sequence, which joyously and wittily, references the Universal horrors of the 30s and 40s, through to the final riding into the sunset, the movie is simply an adventurous romp.<br/><br/>It makes great use of CGI and has enjoyable performances from all the principals (though Richard Roxburgh is perhaps miscast as Dracula). David Wenham's droll monk is a particular delight, and Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's monster delivers the same dignity and gravitas as Karloff did all those years ago.<br/><br/>This movie is great fun and should not be taken too seriously."
"wishful_goddess","3","1","2","16 May 2009"," Very, very bad.
","Let me say that I am a huge fan of Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham, and I don't really have a bias against popcorn flicks or mainly action and CGI-based movies. I enjoyed The Mummy series, and I expected Van Helsing to be somewhere along the same lines: good actors, action adventure, a few snappy funny lines and a very basic but suspenseful storyline.<br/><br/>It is not.<br/><br/>It is very, very bad.<br/><br/>The film has a very flimsy storyline, gaping plot holes, and terrible dialogue. The CGI is very poorly done and is glaringly obvious, to the point where you are unwilling to forgive it. At first, I was very happy to suspend disbelief and continue along as the plot took me. And then, very early on in the film, the plot totally vanished, and I was left saying, ""What the hell is going on?"" Count Dracula requires the machine invented by Dr. Frankenstein (along with his monster) to bring to life his offspring who, because he and his brides are undead, are naturally, born dead. This makes no sense, but you can kind of accept it and that's not a problem. Dracula has lost Frankenstein's monster, however, and has been trying to make the machine work with Werewolves. It fails. At the same time, he's trying to kill off the Valerious family, the last remaining survivor being Kate Beckinsale's character, Anna.<br/><br/>Anna is by far one of the absolute worst heroines I have ever seen in a film. She is completely useless! Nothing she EVER does in the ENTIRE film is AT ALL HELPFUL. She prevents Van Helsing from killing the werewolf that her brother has turned into, she is a major disruptive factor in his killing the vampires, and is constantly offering nothing but incredibly annoying and petulant dialogue. ""I don't need any help"" (directly before displaying how totally awful she is at defending herself against vampires, and directly after completely botching an attempt to kill a werewolf), ""We've been trying to find Dracula for 400 years, I doubt you can do it in 2 hours"" (moments before Van Helsing and Carl discover the door to his lair which was so glaringly obvious it's impossible to miss it), ""You fool! Nobody knows how to kill Dracula!"" (after Van Helsing's failed attempt to kill Dracula, after she has refused to disclose any information whatsoever that would be helpful).<br/><br/>Van Helsing is no better, really, but would have been much more interesting if his storyline was actually, I don't know, EXPLORED instead of just HINTED AT CONSTANTLY? At the beginning, we are told that he has no memory of his past, and grabs at the chance to go to Transylvania for the opportunity to learn more, but right at the point that Dracula is attempting to TELL US, he says, ""Some things are better left forgotten"" and then kills him. Thanks, that's great, but what about the audience?! Maybe we want to know? Dracula himself is a complete failure at being scary, and is a complete failure at being camp. The characterisation is just bad.<br/><br/>And the gaping plot holes? The parts of the movie that just don't make sense? There are SO MANY. Like, they leave Transylvania at a full moon, and then, by the time they hit Budapest, it's already 2 days until the next full moon? It took them A MONTH to get there? Okay, I accept that, but explain to me how it took them only a few hours to GET BACK to find Dracula's lair? How about how at the end, Dracula is apparently missing a finger, but he hasn't been missing a finger for the rest of the entire movie, and even after that moment of revelation, he miraculously has the finger again? And how does a man who is undead and can heal continuously, even not have a finger to begin with? The ending is sappy and unbelievably stupid. Oh, there's CGI Anna, up in the clouds with her family, near the sea (a throwaway line of dialogue earlier that made no sense, and was apparently put in just to enhance the ""emotion"" of her funeral) which is glittering beneath a sunset. And then, as Van Helsing and Carl leave, back for Rome, they walk out, towards land, towards...oh, the sunset again. It wasn't cheesy enough with just ONE sunset, I guess.<br/><br/>AVOID THIS MOVIE. IT IS BAD. FOR REAL."
"ja_kitty_71","10","1","2","24 October 2008"," An awesome Steampunk action/horror film
","This is an awesome steampunk action/horror film about vampire/monster hunter named Gabriel Van Helsing (X-Men's Hugh Jackman). He is based on the character Abraham Van Helsing, created by Bram Stoker; of course he was made younger to appeal to a more modern era, and his name was changed from Abraham to Gabriel. Gabriel works at what-it-looks like a 19th century paranormal secret service in the Vatican.But he oftens complains to the Cardinal Jinette that he is a murderer, killing monsters which were once good, decent people. However, he continues to do his job so that innocent people can no longer be harmed by the monsters who terrorize the world. Gabriel also had lost his memory, and has only clues to his history and true identity.<br/><br/>In the film Van Helsing (along with Friar Carl) was sent from Rome to a protect and aid a gypsy princess/monster hunter named Anna and to help in her family's quest in slaying Dracula. Anna, who is very bullheaded, didn't want to accept his help. However, before she had the chance to formally object, the village was viciously attacked by the three brides of Dracula: Aleera, Verona, and Marishka. Anna fled, knowing that the brides had come for her to finish killing off her family. This left Van Helsing fighting Marishka (the blonde bride), whom he shot with arrows with holy water on them and killed her. After that Van Helsing gains Anna's trust and she decides to work with him and Carl. As Van Helsing and Anna continue on working together they both realize the love they have for each other...I love the shipping between them.<br/><br/>As I said many times, I don't have a favorite scene because I love the WHOLE film."
"elshikh4","Null","1","2","19 October 2008"," Too Much of CGI, Too Less of Everything !
","Unlike good nonsense like (Speed - 1994), and bad nonsense like (Armageddon - 1998), this is the average of the popular trend that we used to receive from the American cinema since the start of the 1990s.<br/><br/>Since James Cameron's (Terminator 2: Judgment Day - 1991), then Steven Spielberg's (Jurassic Park - 1993), the CGI, as the latest revolution in the cinematic special effects, established a unique personality in the action movie making. It became common to have movies with CGI that could make it or overkill it. (Stephen Sommers), as a writer and director, used to dazzle us by unbelievable unstoppable action all the time with the powers of that new magic. But, here, simply something had prevailed in some things.<br/><br/>(Sommers) was determined to beat the record of the CGI's shots in films, watch (The Mummy Returns - 2001) to catch on that, and marvelously after 2 years of hard working, he did it. Undeniably, (Van Helsing) exceeded all its antecedents, and reached to nearly 2000 shots of CGI. Is it good? Yes, if you're a historian of special effects, or a die hard fan of CGI, because after watching this movie you might not love this fact that much!<br/><br/>Actually, not the ""too much of something is bad enough"" matter only that has to bother you while watching, there are another matters: the script just lacks and lacks and lacks. Expressly it could've been fine for any of (Sommers)'s movies, but the overabundance of CGI made it totally unbalanced, unlike the way it was in his more perfect work (The Mummy - 1999). Yes, he accumulated the exposition scenes, all in small detached pieces, as he and all the action's makers now usually do, but in front of this choppy ocean of visual and sonic clamor; the plot, any plot, must look too thin and too weak, or let's say invisible. As if every scene, that has one event and couple of lines, is thrown into comic book in the size of playground!<br/><br/>I hate to watch a respectable star such as (Hugh Jackman), who CAN act, in this empty role, where all what he has to do is: jumping, looking mean to the evil guys, and transforming into cartoonish generated graphic occasionally. Ironically, (Sommers) was so lucky this time to work with a star else the kind of his previous heroes like (Treat Williams) or (Brendan Fraser), however (Sommers) imprisoned (Jackman) unproductively in this mammoth hubbub. The lesion is deeper when (Sommers) even wrote less funny lines, or any lines, for (Jackman) also, to be finally just unexciting image.<br/><br/>Even (Kevin J. O'Connor) in the role ""that had been written especially for him"" looks utterly miscast. The role gave him nothing. In fact, this is not a role or a cameo in the first place. And you'll be more provoked when his very much role, (Carl the sidekick), goes to the unfunny (David Wenham). So the sad result: there is no relief in here. It assured that something was wrong with the whole formula this time.<br/><br/>(Richard Roxburgh) was too hysterical like the movie at times. But who can blame him? Nobody paid heed to performance here, plus he was doing his scenes in a green studio; now how atmospheric!<br/><br/>Aside from (Kate Beckinsale) being so silly, or how they forgot that she got the same hair color of her co-star, why she had to die at the end?! That was teary in unnecessary and fabricated way. Most likely (Sommers) was preparing something for the sequel, where (Anna Valerious) comes back as a rescuer ghost or something. But I'm still asking myself: how (Sommers) forgot to make us feel any bound with the characters just to be worry about them through the huge climax which was nearly the last half hour of the movie?! Not to mention, how the main goods, namely the CGI, looked phony and headlong at places; like the jump at the ballroom scene, or Mr. (Hyde)'s fight.<br/><br/>You have to sense a pity for all of this money, time, and effort, to be in this disappointing blockbuster. I liked the enjoyable idea to gather all the star monsters of the cinematic horror's history, through clever plot, where the unborn children of (Dracula) will come to life by Dr. (Frankenstein)'s beast, with appearances by (The Wolf Man), and Mr. (Hyde). So the Holy Order organization that's MI6 to (James Bond) old times, or the idea of angry young advanced (Van Helsing). Really what a party, and regrettably what a lousy one in the same time. As (Sommers) got the CGI in his mind more than anything, caring for the way (Dracula) walks on walls more than the way he talks!<br/><br/>Despite the record it hit, and points it mastered like the scary sound effects, and the village sets--this movie is average. (Sommers) seemed so joyful about the toys that he was playing with, being the only one who had fun out of them. He wanted to make the biggest eye candy ever, and he delivered it, however semi-pure. He made his own statement in the Horror genre, and left his generation's technique-eats-up-drama kind of stamp too. The only thing to not cry about is that it's not that BAD, UGLY BAD. But it was so close to be a monster itself to tell you the truth!<br/><br/>It has the feeling of video game all over it, and no wonder since they launched it indeed as one, in the same year of its release. Hmmm, makes you think; maybe they erred and made the movie as the video game!"

","Wow... that was even worse than I expected. Many will say I went in already planning to hate it. Well, go waste your money yourself and then tell me what you think. I watched most of this movie with my head shaking in my hands. It was SO bad. I'm just gonna randomly rant: Each actor's accent is worse than the last. The brides are comical and annoying. Frankenstein, played by another Australian stage actor, sounds like a stage actor, practically singing all his lines and overacting. I thought I was watching a musical a couple times. The worst Dracula ever put on screen. The effects range from good to horrid. The music... okay, the music I liked. What were Kate and Hugh thinking? I like both of you! RUN from this crap! Do NOT do a sequel! Blatant plot exposition everywhere. Horrible dialogue. Why does every character (including Frankenstein) have ninja-like reflexes and agility? Every character was playing Spider-Man out there! WAY too much coincidence and predictability. Y'know what? I'm done. There's much more, but I won't waste any more time on it here."
"IsisSaralonde","9","1","2","3 June 2007"," Van Helsing: Fun to watch with friends! Purists: run for the hills!
","First of all, I'd like to say that I do understand the people who really hate this movie. It's got A LOT of CGI in it and almost more action... and that makes it a great movie for some and trash for others. I myself have now seen it about 7 times, including a time with audio commentary and I just can't get enough of it.<br/><br/>**The following might contain spoilers**<br/><br/>So, the story is a little cliché. A man goes to some country to vanquish a great evil, while that great evil plans to take over the world. But this cliché formula can make a great movie when used in the right way. Sommers and his cast and crew managed to do so. The movie is beautiful, great special effects, wonderful locations and a funny and well-chosen cast. The jokes are good, the accents even better (accept for Kate's, she overacts in my opinion) and Richard Roxburgh is a marvelous Dracula.<br/><br/>Let's take a look at the cast. First there is our monster hunter and all-round evil vanquisher Hugh Jackman. Too bad he left out his Aussie accent. He is a rather boastful hero, but the only steady thing in this story. You know his goal and he seems to know too, so just go for it!<br/><br/>Then up pops David Wenham, with a real funny walk and talk. His hair's funny too and those ears... Poor Daisy... He's still great, despite his strange behavior. I think he should also join the Australian baseball team because he throws almost everything.<br/><br/>They needed a bad-ass girl, so Underworld's leading lady Kate Beckinsale came over... No offense, I just don't like Kate Bacchanal...<br/><br/>Who I did like is Richard Roxburgh. Richard does great, had a really cool accent and even seemed to BE Dracula! His international brides Elena, Silvia and Josie rock and look wonderful accompanying their dark master.<br/><br/>Whatever anyone says, Shuler Hensley played an unforgettable Frankenstein's monster and Will Kemp is adorable as Velkan.<br/><br/>Good cast, no wait, GREAT cast. Anyone who dislikes this movie should see the bloopers, the interviews and making offs. You really start to adore the actors and maybe, with a little good will, you could even start to like the movie too.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to any person who's open-minded enough to not flip out because there aren't any lengthy conversations and no deep character studies. It's also good to have a strong stomach. More importantly, this movie is best when watched with friends, because making fun of David Wenham's wrong ears and Dracula's pop star-like ponytail is a lovely thing to do on your average Friday night. <br/><br/>There's only one thing that bothers me and that is the way the Wolf man looks. The ears aren't what they should be...<br/><br/>One last thing: Do watch the movie with Richard Roxburh, Shuler Hensley and Will Kemp commenting on it. They have juicy stories about some scenes..."

","Watching this film was like watching two and a half hours of a very loud video game. The crashing, screaming, wailing, howling, shooting, barking, thundering, etc. let up for about 10 minutes total, which made it difficult to understand the (awful) dialogue. It was also so dark (on TV at least) that I could barely see what appeared to be pretty spectacular sets.<br/><br/>It's too bad, as I think the idea of the film was great, and it did have some excellent touches. The introductory sequence was a wonderful homage. Richard Roxburgh and the last-to-survive of the wives (not sure which actress she was) added some much-needed verve. There were some interesting aspects to the five-second plot that I wish they had capitalized upon.<br/><br/>However, poor Kate Beckinsale, who has been so good elsewhere, was laughable. That outfit!

Packed to the brim with amazing set pieces, stellar production values, and top-notch special effects, which is topped of with terrific action scenes this is one terrific pure adventure movie. And Hugh Jackman, in the title role, makes a terrifically like-able hero. Not only that, it is terrific ode to many classic works of literature and and old European legends. The story is pretty simplistic, but also pretty clever as it weaves the story of Dracula, Frankenstein, and many other classic monsters into one story.<br/><br/>The only problem is that a lot of these stories were originally serious works of philosophical and metaphorical nature. All that is lost here at the expense of spectacle and entertainment, but on the other hand, you'd be pretty dumb to think this is serious movie before you sit down to watch it. Also on a positive note, the ending is not as cheesy as you'd think for a mega-budget action-fest as this. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: a lot of action/violence and ghastly goings-on"

If somebody had gotten ahold of the script and filled in the plot holes, tamed the random wit, and given the movie some purpose... then it could've been great.

The James Bond take on a 19th century vampire hunter was unique, but flowed out of the whole X-Men vibe the movie had. Van Helsing is stuck with his own version of Q, a friar who makes undead killing weaponry.<br/><br/>When a secret order of the church, Van Helsing's regular employers, get word that one of their Transsylvanian vampire hunting families is in trouble, Van Helsing is dispatched to that far and strange place of the mind.

Frankenstein, to create an electric elixir of life that will allow his manifold scions to live. These baby vampires, you see, have a tendency to just blow up in a messy goo whenever they get ready to make their first kill. As this won't do, and I guess Dracula is tired of reproducing by just biting people, he gets dr. Frankenstein to make the Monster of Frankenstein, run huge amounts of electricity through it and, miraculously transfer the proper life force to his Aliens-like brood. The villagers meanwhile are wholly unaware of this new development, as they are more than happy to let Dracula and his three 'brides' suck the life out of one or two of their kin every month. The number of these potential new vampires is enormous, and you have to wonder whether Dracula didn't have the foresight to see that this would lead to a huge vampire overpopulation problem. Who are they going to suck blood out of? They would depopulate all of Rumania. Anyway, I, like the movie, digress...<br/><br/>This is not the very worst horror movie ever made. However, the jokes fall flat, and you have to like Hugh Jackman (I don't). Also, Kate Beckinsale seems a little underpowered in her vampire fighting pirate queen outfit. However the worst I guess are the British accents of the Transsylvanian villagers, which, alongside the CGI laden sets, never let you forget that this is a British studio production. An homage to the Hammer days is one thing, making a good movie out of this is another.<br/><br/>(I liked Sleepy Hollow with Johnnie Depp and Christina Ricci better. Although it has a lot of the same feel, the story is weirder and actually scary in places.)"

","This was one of the only horror films I have survived so far. If you were a huge fan of the Ring or Dark Water, this movie is NOT FOR YOU.<br/><br/>Basically, it was about Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman). He goes to Transylvania and meets Anna Velarious (Beckinsale). They aren't exactly the most romantic couple in the entire world. Not enough flaming passion but they clicked pretty well. <br/><br/>Dracula's brides, I'd say, are the most impressive. The trio are cool and sexy and all that.

It gave me a new perspective on him. Anyhow, Roxburgh did an excellent job in portraying the Count. Frankenstein (Hensley) is your typical Frankie. Green, flat headed, bolts... yada yada yada. He's this kind freak who wants 'to exist'. <br/><br/>Carl (Wenham) is Van Helsing's cute little sidekick. I say Wenham did a great job in playing this guy. I can't hear Carl's voice without cracking up like nuts. <br/><br/>What this story lacks, though, is a good plot. Other than that, I'd say it's good...<br/><br/>9/10."

","""Van Helsing"" is a campy, tongue-in-cheek homage to the three key figures of classic movie horror - Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man - and those who do them battle. Hugh Jackman is the mysterious Van Helsing, a centuries-old monster-slayer who works sub rosa for the Catholic Church in its ongoing battle with the forces of evil. In this tale, Van Helsing is sent off to Transylvania to destroy the famed Count Dracula, a vampire who's been rampaging through the countryside for more than four hundred years now, making life miserable for the inhabitants therein.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, ""Van Helsing"" is a sometimes entertaining, sometimes half-baked adventure tale, beautiful to look at but largely devoid of any real suspense or excitement. The action scenes are overwrought and redundant, filled with computer-generated special effects that are surprisingly second-rate in nature. However, the art direction and set design do an outstanding job creating a Transylvania that plays upon our memories of those Universal classics from the 1930's. Moreover, David Wenham serves as an effective cowardly/comic Sancho Panza-type sidekick for the more staid and conventionally heroic Van Helsing, who suffers pangs of remorse when he is forced to destroy the monsters.<br/><br/>The final battle scene between Van Helsing and Dracula does drag on for a minor eternity, but the movie, overall, should satisfy rabid fans of the action film genre. The rest of us can find intermittent entertainment gawking at the scene."

","Although I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman, (and yes, I HAVE seen other films besides the X-Men movies) I was thoroughly disappointed in Van Helsing. Oh, I could have seen the warning signs ahead of time, One of the more famous literary characters of all time transformed into bounty hunter (No, I haven't seen League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) and featuring creatures not seen in any Dracula story, but Hey! I was going to give this one the old college try. And, yes, by gum! I should have stuck to my guns, because this film is just plain awful. Oh sure, it's pretty to look at, and has a lot of neat special effects, but while it maybe dazzling to look at, they forgot to blue screen one important element and that's plausibility. Time after time, there are instances where I was like, how on earth did they know that was going to happen? Like when the Kate Beckensdale first meets Van Helsing, she has'nt a clue who he is, then after he's done his business, she all of a sudden knows who he is. Implausability after implausibility (the dual carriage scene? Hello?) happen, and by the end, I was like, ""Yeah, whatever""."

I thought it was a good movie to switch off your brain and just watch whats happening on screen even if it was a load of poop.

"Motoko","7","1","2","25 May 2005"," Hysterical fun offered for those prepared to accept it...
","OK. Deep breath. Reputation about to be destroyed. Career as reviewer gone.<br/><br/>I liked Van Helsing.<br/><br/>No, no, no! Let me explain. I think it's awful. The script is terrible. The plot non-existent. It's all just an excuse for some action sequences to be tied together. Now, here's my point: what's wrong with that? I am beginning to rail against the pre-defined notion that all films have to be a Citizen Kane type experience. They must aspire to be the ultimate cinematic achievement they can be. The storyline must be Shakespearean in scope. The dialogue must be a gift from Mamet. The performances must give De Niro sleepless nights for months.<br/><br/>Not always.<br/><br/>Sometimes they can just be fun. And that's what Van Helsing is, it's fun. It's ridiculous, it's hokey, it's silly. But by God, sat in that darkened theatre watching Frankenstein's Monster swing on a rope, Dracula do bloody battle with a Werewolf and the Brides camp it up like harpies possessed, you've just got to roll with it and laugh.<br/><br/>You want to be po-faced? Hell you could rip this to pieces. Nothing makes any sense. The story is riddled with contrivances and conveniences too numerous to mention. Vampire and werewolf lore is shown the nearest exit and told to be cool or else. The dialogue is so cheesy, even Karloff would die of shame saying it. But here's the point. The film doesn't care.<br/><br/>Not in a self-aware kind of way you understand. This isn't some post modern exercise in hip irony. Hugh Jackman doesn't wink at the camera. Roxborough doesn't let the mask slip and reveal that he knows it's all bunkham. You know why? Because they're having fun too! And director Stephen Sommers? He's bouncing up and down in his little directors chair smacked out on sugar having the time of his life playing with the biggest toy set money can buy.<br/><br/>This is clearly a labour of love for Sommers. At the end of the credits is the note 'For My Father.' You just know that when he was 9 Sommers watched every universal Horror movie at least 25 times and lapped it up. He watched them with his father and talked about how cool it would be if the Monsters all met up for a big fight and what would happen. This is that film. This is the film a fan makes. This is the film an obsessive makes to honour the memory of watching monster movies with his father.<br/><br/>Now, I can hear people whispering ""if he wanted to honour Dracula and Frankenstein he should have made a serious adaptation of the books rather than urinating all over Shelley and Stoker's prose and turning them into a funfair ride."" Point taken and accepted. But Sommers doesn't care about the books. He cares about the films. He cares about Karloff and Legosi and Lon Chaney Jr. He cares about damsels being captured and villagers carrying blazing torches and pitchforks and silver and transformations. He cares about the joy of watching a monster create carnage. You want to delve into the sexual awakening of young women in a suffocating society? Or explore the male masturbation fantasy of creating life without the help of woman kind? Move along please, nothing to see here. You want to watch vampires attack a coach travelling at breakneck speed though the Transylvanian forest carrying Frankenstein's Monster with a Werewolf in hot pursuit? Step right this way.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is not a great film. It's debatable whether or not it's even a good film. But it most definitely is a fun film. And sometimes, that's all you need."
"shawnk","9","1","2","8 March 2005"," An excellent progression to a classic theme
","So. How would you evolve the classic characters of 20th Century horror classics? Van Helsing has great effects, an intricate plot, and a subtle sense of tongue in cheek humor (note the villagers are still sort of the same as in the first Frankenstein movie). Add to this a Gothic style of art that borders on the visually spectacular. It all sums up to an excellent progression in the characters and myths of Hollywood monsters :-) I loved this flick. From the 'sidekick friar' (a la 'Q' in James Bond) to the complaining assistant (Igor do this, Igor do that) this film was a real pleasure.<br/><br/>If you have a warm spot in your heart for classic horror and sci-fi you should really see this film. Its a great escape into a more modern rendition of what made the classic horror films really popular (A movie that scares you and makes you feel really good after you've seen it).<br/><br/>With an almost innocent sense of 'humor in the macabre', Van Helsing delivers monsters that are a just scary enough and interesting enough to make them, yet again, perpetually endearing.<br/><br/>Thanks so much to the team who made this a really fun film. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get some popcorn and .. see it again."

A collection of images that move, look and feel computer generated, the plot, or what there is of it, seems motivated only by the ephemeral thrill of creating pretty grotesquerie. In its widely incomprehensible visualization, it serves up the basest of thrills and it does almost nothing to comment on or even penetrate a subject rife for meta-commentary. Please don't give these people any of your money."

","This movie was a snoozer... literally. My father and I went to see Dawn of the Dead at the drive in, the same night that Van Helsing opened, and it happened to be playing after DOTD, so we decided to give it a try. Well, it was just about at the Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde scene that we turned on the car and left. It was mainly because of all the CGI, we just didn't like it. Well, here we are several months later, and we decide to give it a second try, so we went out and rented it last night. Well, we made it past the scene that we stopped at previously, but it was right after Van Helsing fights off the three badly CGI'd vampires and kills one, that I rolled over and went to sleep. The storyline was painful, there was more computer created characters than in Shrek, and the scenes were badly written. If someone were to ask me if they should watch this, I would STRONGLY recommend not doing so.<br/><br/>I had real hopes for this film, as I am a huge Universal Monsters fan, but it strongly disappointed me.<br/><br/>However, this is only my opinion, however strong it may be. If you are into CGI crap and a strongly clichéd action film, then see this.. if not, then avoid.<br/><br/>-KruegerChild"
"Oosterhartbabe","2","1","2","6 February 2005"," Delightfully cheesy good fun!
","This movie is a hilarious cheese-fest. Whether the director intended it to be this camp is hard to tell, although I personally believe that he deliberately made it tongue in cheek. Not only are there tributes to the old Dracula and Frankenstein movies of the 30's and 40's, there are also scenes practically lifted from other spoof films such as Dracula Dead and Loving It.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing-a man with no past and no memories, and one of the worst and most incomprehensible German accents it has ever been my pleasure to laugh at. Plus, his hat is extremely stupid, as well. He works for a secret organization run from the Vatican, which dedicates itself to fighting and destroying evil creatures(Micheal Eisner?)<br/><br/>After the silly black and white opening sequence, you see Van Helsing in 'London', fighting one of the worst CGI monsters I've ever seen. It's supposed to be Mr.Hyde, I guess. This is the start of many dreadful fight scenes full of bad CGI and lots and lots of stupid wire work.<br/><br/>The Vatican's next assignment for Van Helsing(did the slide show self destruct after thirty seconds, I wonder?)is to track down and destroy Count Dracula, with the help of the last members of Dracula's human blood line. Along for the ride is a whiny friar who makes weapons and bombs in a basement. The last family members are a guy who gets bitten and turns into a terrible CGI werewolf who looks like he has porcupine quills instead of fur, and Kate Beckinsale in a long curly wig, high heels, and a corset so tight looking that I wondered how she could breathe, let alone do action sequences. As an added bonus, she sports an accent even worse than Jackman's or Dracula's.<br/><br/>The flying 'brides of Dracula' sequences have about the same level of complexity as the flying demon girl in Army of Darkness. There are many bouts of silly dialogue interspersed with shots of Van Helsing firing a crossbow that seemingly has infinite ammunition.One of the brides is killed, and apparently she was made of green silly putty. All of the f/x on the vamps are just as bad.<br/><br/>Dracula looks like he was gearing up to re-do the cover on the Beatle's Sargeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band album cover. His secret yearning is to be a Daddy, but the only way he can spawn his many ridiculous looking gargoylish devil children is to find a way to give them life, since he and his 'wives' are dead.He uses Kate Beckinsale's brother, who has become the aforementioned werewolf, to try to give his children life. It doesn't work, much to his chagrin. He wanted Dr. Frankenstein's monster because the good doctor had found a way to overcome death by sewing up his multiple body parts and zapping them with random bolts of electricity. With the loss of the monster, it looks as though his chances of becoming 'Undead Father of the Year' are rapidly fading.<br/><br/>Luckily for him, the monster is not dead. Van Helsing and Anna stumble over it after they fall into a hole out of sheer carelessness. This is after they saw Dracula try to bring to life his first batch of cutesy, silly looking children. Unfortunately, this batch wasn't cooked thoroughly so they popped like popcorn. Dracula apparently knows Van Helsing, calling him Gabriel and hinting that he knows far more about his past than amnesia boy does himself. I have to ask-why does Hugh Jackman end up playing so many characters who have suffered a mysterious memory loss? <br/><br/>Anyway, Van Helsing tries to smuggle the monster out of Transylvania via coach, but like all coach service this one is pretty crappy. There's a scene where the horses pulling the coach leap a gorge where the bridge is out as though they're Santa's flying reindeer rather than regular horses. Anna's werewolf brother, now thoroughly controlled by Dracula, interferes and is killed by Van Helsing. He bites Van Helsing before he dies, perhaps as a going away present. Then the single bride still left flying makes off with Anna. So the whole plan is botched, since Van Helsing offers to trade the monster to Dracula to get Anna back.<br/><br/>Enter a Halloween bash being thrown by Cirque Du Soleil. Here Dracula waits to make the exchange, although really he's planning to have his cake and eat it to. He wants to make Anna a bride to replace his lost wives, and get the monster as well. Van Helsing, wearing a dumb Zorro mask, rescues Anna but loses the monster to Dracula. So now he has to find Dracula's palace, kill Dracula, get a cure for his lycanthropy, and rescue the monster. All before he turns into a raving blood thirsty werewolf for the rest of his life. Not too much to ask, huh? <br/><br/>Suffice it to say that he manages all of these tasks. Anna gets killed while giving him the antidote to werewolfism, and there's another ridiculously stupid CGI sequence that's like It's A Wonderful Life as filtered through the Lifetime channel. In other words, pure sentimental schmaltz. Then you see Van Helsing and the friar riding off into the sunset. A CGI sunset, that is. And you see the freed Frankenstein monster sailing a raft to Fiji, apparently under the mistaken belief that he's Thor Heyerdahl. Or maybe Huck Finn, who knows?<br/><br/>I laughed harder at this film than I have at some which are labeled as comedies. It's too bad that Mystery Science Theater 3000 went out of business, they'd have loved a film like Van Helsing."

","Anyone familiar with Robert E. Howard's SOLOMON KANE will recognize VAN HELSING for what it is: a rip-off, plain and simple (with emphasis on the ""simple""). The prologue, which promised much, fizzled miserably much too soon and proved, unfortunately, a portent of things to come. While I must confess I thought Jackman was great in the two X-MEN movies, he seems miscast here: the director might just as well have stood a mannequin before the camera; it would've been cheaper, I'm sure-and the overall effect would've been about the same. And the awful cgi only make matters worse: the movie virtually(!) turns into a video game whenever anything remotely interesting starts to happen, with fx so cheesy that one wonders why the producers didn't simply render the entire feature thus. Why bother with live action at all if you're that gung-ho for computer graphics? TOY STORY and SHREK (among others) have confirmed the viability of cgi features. Anyone out there familiar with anime...? Or, say, Richard Corben's DEN- a series of stories that would lend themselves readily to this particular form? There's a veritable plethora of untapped material floating around that would make good cgi fodder. Dispense with the flesh-and-blood folks and get busy with some real animation, if that's what you're interested in doing..."

I'll give it that, but so many things are overdone that the whole effort comes across as being way over the top. And the normally talented Kate Beckinsale's Romanian accent is scarcely believable. Most of the characters in fact are either cliché or pulled off very badly, especially Dracula, he looks so much like professor snape from harry potter that I expected him to pull out a wand at any moment. If you want a real Dracula look at gary oldman's incredible performance and the makeup job they did on him, THAT's a scary Dracula. Special effects are OK, adherance to reality isn't. There aren't many movies that make me shake my head in disbelief, but this is one of them.<br/><br/>The splicing of almost all the major horror characters of the days of old is also something worth mentioning, the only one missing is the mummy, and fortunately they didn't put him in there. I guess they didn't have the creativity to come up with a decent plot so instead they just cut and paste a bunch of done-to-death characters together in the hope of coming up with something ""new"".<br/><br/>All in all a pitiful attempt at a monster movie that will soon be forgotten.

Decent story, um no. Too many incongruities and unanswered questions. Cool fight scenes...okay I give in here...there were some interesting fights, but nothing truly spectacular. Interesting characters. They could have been, but they were so poorly presented to the audience that I had to wonder whether the director considers his audience to be mentally incapacitated. Character history is spoon-fed in stilted dialogue and you don't truly get a sense of any of the characters. And big scary bad guy...just no.<br/><br/>The worst part is that this could have been a truly entertaining action movie. Unfortunately, half an hour into it I couldn't figure out whether the lead had serious angst or not, and was in fact wondering whether this was an action, drama, comedy, or horror flick. The techniques Sommers used to highlight humor, drama and action in earlier films were so inappropriately used as to be distracting from the story...hmm, considering the deficiencies there, perhaps it was intentional."

Shoulda been a winner! Unfortunately the movie went wrong in sooooooooo many ways. I mean, it's not a total drag but it definitely has too many strikes against it. First problem: wayyyyyyyyyyy too much reliance on CGI. When are the techno geeks making these movies going to get it thru their heads... CGI still looks FAKE! If you use it sparingly you can trick audiences into believing that they are seeing something impossible happen... but when its just effect after effect after effect... well, we might as well be watching someone playing a video game. Second problem: bad acting. Jackman is alright as Van Helsing... and that one blond chick with the weird accent was kinda fun... but Kate Beckinsale as the butt-kickin' gypsy wench was just embarrassing. Ditto for the dude playing Dracula. And I really could have done without the characters speaking in modern vernacular. Vampires exclaiming, ""Too bad, so sad""??? Puh-leeeeeeeease! Third problem: this goes back to the CGI thing... there was too much reliance on mindless action for action's sake... the characters needed some more dialogue! Maybe a few scenes to make us care about these characters (so that the small tragedy at the end might have actually *meant* something)? So, do yourself a favor and forget about this bizarre attempt at combining James Bond with Hammer Films... and go see ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" which is 10 times the movie this is."

","I know Stephen Sommers had previously directed ""The Mummy"" (which i enjoyed) and i knew this would not be a film for the Oscars so to speak. My expectations were rather low in other words, or rather i was expecting an entertaining adventure ride since Sommers could previously deliver on that. But Van Helsing is not an entertaining ride. It's a train-wreck!<br/><br/>Van Helsing is the Vatican's premier monster-hunter. Now the Valerious family is in trouble. They swore that they would destroy the vampire Dracula, if they didn't none of their family-members would ever enter heaven. Now only two members of the family remain and Van Helsing must help them, otherwise the family will be doomed forever.<br/><br/>Van Helsing sure doesn't lack action. There is shooting, fencing, kicking and fighting going on throughout the whole running time. It also doesn't lack CGI as almost every scene is filled with CGI of a varying quality. Some of it looks exceptionally good, while some of it is simply terrible. Maybe they ran out of money somewhere?<br/><br/>Of the actors, Hugh Jackman is the only one that really works in his role as Van Helsing. Probably because he seems relaxed and at ease. Everybody else is terrible. Especially Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious and Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. Their characters are a mess of stiff acting and horrible accents.<br/><br/>Still. The acting is a minor distraction in this mess. Worse is the complete lack of coherence. Everybody runs around, screaming and fighting, and you never ever get a feel for a single character or what the movie is about. Rather it's loosely connected action scenes put on top of each other.

I guess because it isn't utterly ""in your face"" it doesn't make sense to the average American viewer. Watch it again, and look for the references to Star Wars, James Bond, Polanski's ""Dance of the Vampires"", and doubtless many more I've missed.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought Roxborough was one of the best Draculas, in context, I have ever seen. Ditto the Brides and Frankenstein's Monster. Jackman was pretty wooden, but acceptable. Pity Beckinsale was a sexist joke from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I've seen it twice and would be happy to see it again."

","If you're looking to see great acting, this is not the film for you. It is done rather tongue in cheek and has some very funny moments. But what makes this film so interesting and entertaining is the breathtaking special effects and superb action. While to some viewers it may be flawed (for example the leading lady's hair is always perfect despite many altercations and assaults!), those of you who, like me, prefer to just sit back and enjoy as opposed to judging won't be disappointed. The vampires are the best yet, depicted with awesome detail and move about like nothing you've ever seen in vampire movies. Hugh Jackman (Dr. Van Helsing) is great for the part and Kate Beckinsale (Anna) looks terrific. The camera angles are spectacular and that combined with great action sequences keeps the movie moving at a perfect pace. If you get bored, you'd better stick to dramas and to those who feel they have to pan it, lighten up will ya! This movie does not take itself seriously, nor should you. It's just great fun and one heck of a roller coaster ride!!"

","I watched Van Helsing after hearing a lot of critics about it. And I was really surprised ! Was the movie misunderstood ? I find it quite funny actually (the situation with Hyde/Jekyll is hilarious).<br/><br/>I think most people thought it was going to be an adventure story, and that happens quite often. When you think a movie has a precise genre (adventure) and it turns out being more funny, you're disappointed. I had that with From Dusk Till Down, at first I thought it was going to be a kill, kill, kill movie and when those vampires arrived I just couldn't watch it anymore ! But after a year I ""tried"" to watch it again, knowing it had some fantastic spirit in it, and I really liked it. For those who didn't liked Van Helsing because it wasn't adventurous enough, try to watch it again and think about it as a comedy ! You'll really enjoy it (I hope so :)<br/><br/>Morgie."

VAN HELSING is a bad movie, nothing more to say!<br/><br/>Abraham Van Helsing hunts down all evil creatures around Europe in the late 1880ties. His next mission after killing Dr.Jekyll/Mr.Hyde in a weird way in Paris, is to stop Count Dracula from killing several generations of family in Transylvania. Everything Dracula wants is birth to his hideous children; but this he only can get threw the power of a former monster, Frankenstein's fearsome man/creature.<br/><br/>The movie is never good in any way. It only glimpses with fine costumes, settings and ideas. But; this three things really doesn't save a movie who's acting is to be embarrassed, with sucky soundtrack that reminds you of some early 1980ties TV Show (or a Boyband tune), directing that doesn't stand out more than a bad High School short film...I mean; everything is so gruesome bad!<br/><br/>VAN HELSING won't let you close your eyes for one second because it's too rushed up and too hurried to get to the next spectacle of a action scene! It's very disturbing, very irritating and very childish in many ways. Hugh Jackman's character Van Helsing, is in bottom a truly fine role, but with all this Hollywood crap and teenage-focused entertainment this movie just drops from a skyscraper and gets smashed like a tomato. Robert Roxburgh's performance as Dracula made me want to look away practically. All the pathetic evil chit-chat goes on and on; and the movie lasts for 2 hours!

","Stephan Sommers, responsible for the simplistic, high action, low plot, and mildly diverting Mummy series, continues his love of the B-movie and monster movie with this CGI laden action fest. Van Helsing is about the legendary mythical Vampire Hunter and Sommer's not only pits him against Vampire, but Werewolves, Harpies, Frankenstein's monster and Dr Jekyll and his alter ego, Mr Hyde. Already you can tell that this film is all about the action.<br/><br/>This is a mildly diverting and occasionally spectacular movie but at the end of the day it's forgettable and hollow, despite the superb Jackman. Hugh Jackman plays the titular hero and as he was in X Men and Swordfish, he makes an engaging and charismatic action hero, thanks to that extra bit of acting ability that traditional action stars don't usually have. Co-Starring is the sex-tastic Kake Beckinsdale who is ravishingly good as Van Helsings not so damsel in distress, love interest. <br/><br/>The problem with this film is that despite being huge in scale, it just doesn't engage the audience. It's almost too big for it's boots and lacks the wit and rollicking enjoyment value of The Mummy. There are too many elements, It's like adding more spices than you need to a perfectly good curry and ruining the flavour. Whereas as The Mummy was a nicely spiced Chicken Jalfrezi, this is a Prawn, Chicken, Lamb and Beef, Tikka-Massalla-Bhoona-Dhansak (I know my curries!). Something full of elements that should work, but in the end don't. Sommers loses grip and in the end seems to be at the computer screen whacking off in delight at all the techno wizardry before him and as such we get over the top action sequences, CGI crane shots and just too much sugar coating for something that was far to sweetened to begin with. It's teeth rotting stuff this and you'll leave with a stomach ache for sure. That's enough of the food analogies, I'm getting hungry but basically this really is an excessive and ultimately wasteful exercise in making a movie purely for the box office receipts. <br/><br/>This has its moments but is a waste of a talented cast, with Jackman in particular not given enough to do. **"

","All I need, to enjoy a movie, is to be able to watch most of it without thinking ""There's another unintentionally stupid scene."" I didn't enjoy 'Van Helsing'. Bad accents in the beginning, but hardly any accents at all throughout the rest of the movie. Vampires so stupid that they can move across the room so fast that you cannot see it happen, yet who never use that ability to dispatch an enemy. Vampires who shrivel up and die in fast forward motion when a bright light is shined on them (there were no claims that the ""light grenade"" was actually sunlight). The scene when the vampire spawn went to feed had most of the townspeople standing in the middle of the street at night, apparently just waiting for such a night to happen. How about when he was using the two hundred round per minute crossbow and hitting the brides with one out of every 20-30 shots, but when Anna was being carried away, he was suddenly an eagle-eyed marksman. How about the zero recoil pistol that fired a one inch wide projectile across a wide chasm and through half a foot of stone. How about when all those people were shooting at the werewolf in the cage.. didn't anybody think about telling them to stop while their friend was in the fire zone? Speaking of those people, none of them had guns when they decided to wait in the middle of the street at night for the vampire-spawn to come make a late dinner of them. Now that I've mentioned the spawn again, it makes me wonder how the purely scientific idea of the life of Frankenstein's monster can be linked via an apparently spiritual connection to their continued existence. And why did everyone insist on mispronouncing Dr. Frankenstein's name? After all this (and much more that I don't have the patience to note), I too would like to see 'Van Helsing' on one of IMDb's lists. I don't think I have to explain which one."

"jrichards2-1","4","1","2","22 October 2004"," Dismal with highlights
","OK. I admit it. I usually have a soft spot for things like this. I like to see a bit of mindless action every now and again, and as I shuffled into the cinema with my mountain of popcorn I was eager to see the latest take on the vampire story. Yes, my expectations were pretty low, but I still anticipated a certain basic standard.<br/><br/>Van Helsing, however, sets itself an extremely low standard which it fails to maintain. A cross bow which fires with the speed of a machine gun. Ridiculous Romanian accents which wouldn't convince a deaf person. A sniveling, cowardly monk who makes a limp attempt to imitate Q from James Bond, and FAILS. I'm sure you're getting the picture. But let's not be too hasty. I'm not saying this has nil points for entertainment value. There is action, even if it is bloated with special effects which make the film look like a computer game. It's simply rather uninspiring and not anything we haven't seen before. Certainly not enough to make up for the poor script, ill-planned plot and disconcerting length, though.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was the big disappointment for me. He looked like he'd spent a bit too much time applying fake tan; his character was meant to be rough and over-worked, but he turned out far too pretty to be convincing in the role. Overall his performance was dire. Richard Roxborough was much better as Count Dracula (not to mention better looking), but he was also weaker than he should have been. Roxborough is a fair actor and I think he could have made the role more his own if there wasn't so much focus on special effects in the film. Unlike Jackman, he is not beyond redemption.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the lovely Kate, who from her clothing I gathered to be some kind of Romanian cowgirl. Well, she can saddle up and ride away, so far as I'm concerned. She was stronger than Jackman, though, and I certainly preferred her to the leering vampiresses. The scene in which she danced with the count was visually one of the most spectacular, although the dialogue was intensely annoying at that point. Nice dress. Wouldn't mind one of those.<br/><br/>Well, if I haven't put you off, please get down to a video store right now and rent out Van Helsing. It's not beyond the bounds of possibility that you'll enjoy it. But it isn't a GOOD film, and that's the material point.4 out of 10. The only real highlights are in Hugh Jackman's hair."

","How do you ruin four of the most timeless, scariest, and three-dimensional horror characters in history? Well, if you're Stephen Sommers you put them in a special effects-laden piece of trash like this, and then make like a politician and cop -out insisting you're a fan of these monsters, just to cover your bases and prevent criticism for directing and overseeing this chunk of cinematic sacrilege. The best about the opening of ""Van Helsing"" in theaters, you ask? Their releases of Universal's monster classics in boxed sets. Maybe it was sub-conscious guilt on part of Universal for ruining their characters.<br/><br/>Van Helsing, my favorite literary hero of all time is resurrected for the hundredth time around ala Bruckheimer motif in this franchise wannabe called ""Van Helsing"". I've read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" in high school, all excellent books in their own level, and all metaphors in their own dimensions, but hardly is the depth and complexity present here, except their concepts, almost as if brought together by a five year old, or in this case Sommers' mentality, and the concepts are the only things on parade here. Normally, bringing together these classic horror characters would be gold for any horror fan such as myself, and I remember many a horror fan excited at the reunion of these characters, but Sommers' has single-handedly ruined the legacies people like James Whale, Tod Browning, George Waggner, and Rouben Mamoulian set forth with their loose but powerful adaptations of these literary characters, and Sommers completely misses the point of these tragic characters with a messy, hackney script.<br/><br/>In it's concept alone ""Van Helsing"" manages to pull off the feel of an old time serial with a feeling of adventure and sheer fantasy that will leave you sitting there without having to think about the plot. It's a good time killer with its ridiculous plot line and action. It does achieve entertainment level in certain points of the film including stunning cinematography, and some really nice action sequences including the horse and carriage scene with the wolfman, and the climax where Van Helsing and Dracula throw down, the only real sequence that had me excited. Some will definitely consider it a guilty pleasure, and in many ways it is.<br/><br/>Sommers' most heinous crime is ruining these characters with one fell swoop. This is blasphemy at its worst, and a spit in the face of every horror fan that grew up with the Universal horror films. Sommers manages to resort some of the scariest most complex three-dimensional horror figures of all time to modern mindless monsters (ala the wolfman), turns them into campy figures (ala Mr. Hyde who looks like a combination of a Shrek, an ape, and Andre the Giant), and Dracula whom sports a really corny ponytail and often has lovers' spats with his brides; and we're blessed enough to see horrifyingly bad scenes with horrid dialogue from his mates like ""You'll get another bride? Is that all we are to you?"" They also whine incessantly about their losses, including the brides who are really obnoxious, and over the top, all scenes that beg for eye rolls. Who knew Dracula was a cornball who resembled a soap opera star? Richard Roxburgh whom I liked as M in ""LXG"" is dreadful as Dracula. Where's Christopher Lee when you need him? Here Dracula looks like Antonio Banderas combined with the accent of Fernando Lamas. Oh, and in Sommers' reality, vampires don't burn up when staked, they burst into green ooze, it was something I've never seen before, and wish I hadn't.<br/><br/>Many characters here are composites of better characters, or retreads of older characters ala Frankenstein whom is a more colorful version of Karloff's Frankenstein. Our hero Van Helsing's costume concept is a composite of The Shadow, Vampire Hunter D, and Batman, has zero personality and has dialogue that is comprised mostly of one-liners. Sommers uses the same reliable story clichés and devices such as the rogue hero under the employ of the church who has a secret organization involved with thwarting evil, and he barks that he's tired of working, they beckon him to go back and fight, blah blah. Our anti-hero is even complete with his very own ""Q"" clone named Carl (David Wenham) who is zany, whacky, a misfit, but brilliant; aren't they all? Van Helsing is a character that I was desperately trying to take a liking to, but his character, and the way he's written is so utterly uneven. One minute he's a warrior, the next a cowboy, then he's a Sherlock Holmes detective, and suddenly he can sense evil, like Spider-Man. Memo to Sommers: Just pick one concept and stick with it.<br/><br/>Beckinsale is pretty much a clone of her ""Underworld"" character sans the fangs, charisma, and pure sex appeal, but she does manage to sport a really corny gypsy accent and is a relatively useless character. There's a highly vexing moment where Anna and Van Helsing face off against Dracula's brides in a town square, Anna is rendered helpless, but later on goes through a basic arsenal of weapons in a church... the question I ask is: why couldn't she have used those weapons in the attack? And somehow she always sports a sword but never uses it. <br/><br/>The special effects are horrible! The figures are stiff, and grainy, often times the double exposures of the actors' faces in the creatures bodies are rigid and bland, and the morphing, though smooth, is over-used and cartoonish, and boy does Sommers love to use those special effects. Every scene in the film is comprised of eye candy more useful for people with short-attention spans and in that, Sommers manages to insult his audiences intelligence sporting non-stop special effects and never settling down to tell the story, which is completely nonsensical. At the beginning Anna and her gang are more than willing to mercilessly slaughter a werewolf but once her brother turns, she begins making excuses like ""It's not his fault"", and ""he's innocent"", and ""that body hair was already there""--well, that wasn't one of the lines, but you have to hate her for easily being able to kill an innocent stranger who's a werewolf, but pitying her brother who's a werewolf and making excuses.<br/><br/>There are also plenty of plot holes that go on and on, I'm afraid. In the end, all Sommers has done is ruined some of my favorite characters of all time dumbing them down, his usual sense of mind-numbing action and special effects, lack of characterization, and the horrible starter to a surely terrible franchise."

I was a little disappointed by the ant-climax after the final battle, but it works because who would expect a career murderer (Van Helsing - played by Hugh Jackman) to actually walk away with ""the girl."" <br/><br/>The use of CG in this film is better than anything I've seen, and the information in the DVD extras about how it was done is great. This period fantasy piece does push the envelope of CG technology, raising the monsters to a level of realism almost believable, and the performers seemed to have had fun making the film.<br/><br/>I found this to be very entertaining, and so did my wife. We will be adding it to our permanent collection soon."

The beginning was odd but I understood the campiness of it, which, if it had of been maintained throughout the film would have made more sense...I got the humor in the movie but it lacked in a lot of places, and the guy playing Dracula was way too over the top to be Dracula. And what is this Vladislaus stuff? You cannot rewrite and rename precious literature to suit the purposes of a over-the-top Hollywood production. Kate Beckinsale was beautiful and ALMOST did a good acting job. Mostly, it was the HORRIBLE English/Russian/transylvanian(?) accent that killed it. Dialect coach, anyone?<br/><br/>There was so much unexplained, the right-hand-of-God thing, especially. Hugh Jackman was hot hot hot looking like Vampire Hunter D, and brought something to his role, which sadly, no one else did except for Frankenstein.<br/><br/>The CG was AWFUL, the whole thing was a choppy mess just like this review. The only reason why I made it to the end is because I paid good money for that DVD, nothing else held me to it. A poor excuse for a vampire movie. One more thing. That Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde sequence in the beginning was terrible.

"capricious_nature","Null","1","2","14 October 2004"," Actually a funny film
","To get it out of the way to start with, this film is not a horror film. It's not scary (unless Beckinsale's atrocious accent frightens you, as it<br/><br/>did me) and it's not particularly full of horror of any description. I<br/><br/>will start with what is wrong about this film--then what is right<br/><br/>about it (the latter being the larger part of this review). <br/><br/>Yes, Beckinsale and Jackman do take themselves too seriously. <br/><br/>They seem to be under the impression that this film was meant to<br/><br/>be some sort of Shakespearean-type horrorfest--a blend of the<br/><br/>artfulness of ""Hamlet"" and the terrifying aspects of the 1931<br/><br/>""Dracula."" Well, the truth is that the film seems to be leaning<br/><br/>closer to the Hammer studios and/or Rocky Horror-type scenario. <br/><br/>It's supposed to be funny-something that neither Jackman nor<br/><br/>Beckinsale seem to comprehend. Beckinsale's accent is horrible,<br/><br/>and not in the funny kind of way. It's just bad. Will Kemp as her<br/><br/>brother is probably the only bad actor in the lot, and he proves it<br/><br/>too. Yeah, acting school. Beyond that, the carriage exploding like<br/><br/>an 18-wheeler at the bottom of a gorge in Transylvania (I know that<br/><br/>there's supposed to be nitroglycerin in it, but really now) is just a<br/><br/>little too over the top for even my sense of the absurd. So much for<br/><br/>the bad. Now for the good. <br/><br/>First of all, the sets are fantastic and the CGI appropriately silly in<br/><br/>places. The opening scene is a glorious homage to the masters<br/><br/>and every shot is perfectly, gloriously derivative, making the film<br/><br/>into a work of post-post-modernity. David Wenham as Carl is<br/><br/>simply marvelous and funny, and Shuler Hensley as a semi-philosophical Frankenstein Monster makes the world<br/><br/>appear at least a little more serious--maybe. The brides of<br/><br/>Dracula are, well, the brides of Dracula,and with their shrieking<br/><br/>laughter and rampant desire to sleep with anything and everything,<br/><br/>they are entertaining. What more can you expect from a tribute to<br/><br/>the B-horror movie genre? <br/><br/>A word must be said about the incredibly attractive and sexy<br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. Honestly, the sexiest Dracula<br/><br/>since...well, the sexiest Dracula. He is so wonderfully over the top,<br/><br/>taking the role both seriously and with a grain of salt at the same<br/><br/>time, and never once losing his accent (which, like everything else<br/><br/>in this film, is properly affected and a little silly). If this film is<br/><br/>destined to be made into a movie franchise, let Sommers bring<br/><br/>back Roxburgh for the sequel! He was by far the best part of the<br/><br/>film, and always enjoyable to watch. Let this be the incarnation of<br/><br/>a cinematic Dracula that is here to stay!<br/><br/>So, it's not a bad film if you can laugh at it. Don't rent it, buy it, or go see it without knowing that you have to laugh (whether you're<br/><br/>supposed to or not is beside the point). Take ""Van Helsing"" too<br/><br/>seriously, and it's a dud. But, take it as it seems meant to be<br/><br/>taken, as a tribute to B-horror films and an entertaining (if not<br/><br/>totally campy) piece of Hollywood silliness, and you'll be satisfied. <br/><br/>There's no reason not to laugh."

Any film that requires Hollywood actors to do Eastern European/Russian accents is bound to fail because, let's face it - nobody can pull off a convincing performance.<br/><br/>The score is horrible, the characters are the kind you wish just want to die and the effects beg the question - if you can't get into a film because there is far too much noticeable CG, then why don't they make the whole thing CG?<br/><br/>Of course, the hopes for this to succeed were non-existent ever since Stephen Sommers (Mummy, Mummy Returns, Mummy zzzzz) got his grubby little hands on the project. His direction sucks, his writing sucks - and he's done little more than wreck three decent actors, one decent actress and the entire monster list for Universal.<br/><br/>The only purpose for recommending this film to you, would be to realize how hype can make a film seem promising. Take my advice, make a switch to Asian cinema and Anime. They can manage an original story, because this one sucks well before the Vampires show up."

","Decent, mindless entertainment. That's all I really need to describe Van Helsing, but since I must write ten lines or more I'll try to elaborate.<br/><br/>This movie is, obviously, no masterpiece. But then again I don't thing it was meant to be one. Viewed as an action movie paying homage to old monster movies it provides enough entertainment, so that you don't feel sorry about wasting your money or your time.<br/><br/>On the good side, Jackman and Beckinsale are good enough, there is enough action to keep the movie going, the effects are decent (not too bad not too good) and it's always good to see the classic monsters. On the bad side, this movie has the worst Count Dracula ever (which really hurts the film), the CGI effects are overused and the script is below average.<br/><br/>To sum it up, it's probably worth a viewing, just don't expect too much.

"clumzy","6","1","2","27 September 2004"," Halloween Monsters, Wild Wild West and 007
","clumzy's Take on ""Van Helsing"" - Rating - Maybe Worth a Free Viewing<br/><br/>I like to think of myself as a manly guy. I lift weights, do the maintenance on my own car, I've built a deck, and most importantly I like guy movies. You know the ones I'm talking about: Terminator, Predator, The Matrix, and the original Star Wars Trilogy to name but a few. A good movie to me is a simple mix of interesting characters, a story that gets you caring about them and maybe a helicopter, a car chase and some wire-fu but whatever, I'm no screen writer. So you would think that taking the classic monsters of yore like the Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein and mixing in a hard-nosed ""James Bond""-ish monster hunter and a leggy corseted butt-kicking babe would make for a delightful recipe for a slob like me. Yup, unfortunately, not so much so.<br/><br/>Set in the late 1800's the enigmatic Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a ""secret agent"" of sorts who's sole purpose is the hunting and killing of evil monsters. His exploits take him and his friar sidekick (David Wenham) to Transylvania to knock off the dreaded Count Dracula and save the sexy warrior princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) et al from eternal damnation. Van Helsing is armed to the teeth with an impressive array of medieval weaponry including a crossbow machine gun, some sort of spinny cutting disc saws and a couple of revolvers which make for some John Woo-ish slow-mo jumping shooting scenes. Oh ya and there's a bunch of CG Halloween monsters running and flying around in the dreary, dark, and gloomy Transylvania sets.<br/><br/>Sounds pretty good so far doesn't it? Unfortunately this film has no magic, no charm, no style and wholly improbable action sequences. Jackman, although slightly more amiable than his role in Xmen plays his tough-guy shtick cardboard cutout of a character leaping, flipping, shooting but making no connection with the viewer. Beckinsale, the noble warrior, prances around using her pseudo-kung-fu in high-heels and too-tight corset, blandly making me yawn and say ""meh, whatever"". Wenhem, who was very promising in Lord of the Rings, is absolutely wasted here, playing that annoying British sidekick from Relic Hunter. Finally our villain Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) is straight out of Wild Wild West or Shanghai Knights 2, brilliantly laughable. <br/><br/>The last nail in the coffin is exactly what this kind of film hinges on: Computer Graphics. Now we all know that computers have revolutionized film making, saving hack scripts from the recycling bin with the promise of ""realistic"" action that will blow our minds. Here's some news Hollywood, WE ARE NOT IMPRESSED. Your shiny flashy computer puppetry can't cover up those stinker stories and one dimensional characters. Like a good music score, CG should be used to augment the action and further the feel and style of the film, not take centre stage and scream ""Look at me, I'm not even real!"" Fine, we've been over this before, and clearly in Van Helsing, we see more than a plethora of CG baddies, flying thingies and gooy green globs floating around. In this case, it doesn't make for a pleasant experience. Top that off with sets and camera work from a bad Wil Smith movie, completely improbable action swinging, luckshots and gaps in logic and you've got few reasons to pay attention.<br/><br/>Really, I wanted to like this movie because of the huge ""guy"" factor but there's just too many things to overlook. Here is a prime example of a decent premise that will fade quickly into the forgotten because of over Hollywooding. The only saving grace to Van Helsing is that there was no blatant setup for a sequel. We can only hope."

","Contains some spoiling but I concentrated on the positive things!<br/><br/>There's nothing to say about the story  there is none.

Dracula<br/><br/>himself is sometimes soooo cool that you could wish he wouldn't<br/><br/>become just another victim of Van Helsing's (but his voice is really<br/><br/>annoying). Hugh Jackman is just sexy, and so is Will Kemp, who<br/><br/>unfortunately doesn't appear too often as Velkan, the human<br/><br/>shape of the Werewolf. In my study about the different ideas of vampires in movies, I found<br/><br/>another interesting way to show them: they can transform into<br/><br/>strange, white-skinned creatures between human and bat that<br/><br/>don't look good at all, but, nobody's perfect. :-) And the idea about<br/><br/>the slimy ""eggs' that are stored for hundreds of years until<br/><br/>thousands of babies come out at once  I don't know  There was a positive surprise for me about the ending of the love<br/><br/>story between Van Helsing and Anna  but I don't want to tell too<br/><br/>much here.

"jaywolfenstien","Null","1","2","10 September 2004"," A little too over the top for my tastes.
","The film opens up with a wonderful b&w sequence in the spirit of James Whale's Frankenstein. I sat back and grinned from ear to ear while this homage unfolded. I loved seeing the infamous doctor, his monster, and the undead count in the same frame, and I thought to myself this would be a fascinating action-oriented homage to the 1930s classics. Then the rest of the film kicked in and we jumped to Van Helsing in color. <br/><br/>An abundance of elongated action sequences with overly colorful CG characters plague this film. The CG (which I've complained about numerous times in numerous other films) I am beginning to tolerate since I can't watch a film without it anymore. Key phrase 'beginning to' so the over-the-top, overly long action sequences still bother me. <br/><br/>The most prominent and painful to watch (in my mind) occurs with Helsing's very first encounter with the vampires. I can only watch an automatic crossbow miss so many hundreds of times only to have a multitude of false endings to the sequence. Sommers, this isn't intense, it's not suspense, it's annoying, and it makes the rest of the film unbelievable when monsters are dispatched seemingly effortlessly.<br/><br/>The plot and characters are a mixed bag of deeply rooted fun-spirited good points tightly intertwined with a roughly equal number of uninspired bad point. It rides a very uncomfortable line as though it's unsure if its gone too far in its quirkiness or crossed the threshold of unbelievability. I can't say I particularly liked or hated these narrative elements; 'Eh' about sums up my feelings. People looking for reasons to love or hate the film won't have any trouble supporting their arguments either way.<br/><br/>Most of the pleasures of this film came with the nods to the movie-monsters' previous works in cinema (in particularly the Bride of Frankenstein esque-material in the sewer brought me to the edge of my seat and elicited a smile). It is very obvious that Sommers and crew had a deep affection for the films modern horror was built upon; he tries (with mixed results) to pay honest tribute without blatantly and soullessly imitating them. <br/><br/>Also, I was strangely entertained and impressed by Richard Roxburgh's portrayal of the infamous count, and surprised to find myself on the minority end there. In retrospect, though, when an actor goes out on a limb with a ballsy performance, it's usually hit or miss with the audience.<br/><br/>Beyond that, many minor complaints that manage to add up overall bring down the experience. Anyway, in the end, it's about what you would expect from a PG-13 action flick from 1930s-monster-movie-lover Stephen Sommers. Take it or leave it."

","""Van Helsing"" is turning out to be the most under-rated film of the summer. I can only suppose that viewers are kind of burnt out on Hollywood's reliance on CGI in its action blockbusters. This, combined with an apparent shortage of fans of the original Universal monsters, has really undermined the success of an actually fun, enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>First of all, having Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man in the same film, in this day and age... God, how long has it been? And with the great leaps in visual effects over the years, this had to be worth watching, and it is. The filmmakers simply took the essence of these classic characters and amped them up to what they logically would look and act like in a glossy, high-budget feature in 2004. <br/><br/>The first clever choice was in constructing a plot that connects these 3 icons who come from different stories. Sure, it's been done before, but as a joke (Abbott & Costello, various cartoons...). In this film, a world has been created that successfully integrates the mythologies of vampires and werewolves, and also manages to fit in a mad scientist and his electrically-resurrected creature without feeling forced or unnatural. To accommodate all of this, a few slight liberties are taken with certain well-known ""facts"" about these characters; I won't say more than that, other than to rave about the novel, and clever ways these monsters are ""re-imagined"" for this particular story.<br/><br/>The other clever decision was in having the story truly revolve around the hero, Van Helsing. In past movies about Dracula, the good and noble Van Helsing was a stuffy old scholar (based upon the character in the original novel); here, he is a fully-accessorized action hero, with a haunted soul and a mean crossbow. Furthermore, in virtually every other monster movie ever made, the alleged heroes are flat, generic do-gooders with no personality, allowing the monsters to chew scenery and wreak much havoc; here, though the monsters are the reason you came, and are fun to watch in all their malevolence, it is Van Helsing we're rooting for, and who gets our applause when he goes to work and raises cain all over Transylvania.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect movie? Hardly. There are times when it threatens to collapse under the weight of its multiple plot elements. But for the ""haters"" who seemed to be expecting a ""David Fincher meets Tim Burton"" kind of production (and really, with the exception of ""Sleepy Hollow"", Burton can hardly be accused of making films that are ""fun""), well, you all came to the wrong party. <br/><br/>In short, ""Van Helsing"" takes a dashing James Bond/Indiana Jones action-hero sensibility, successfully resurrects the ghoulish Gothic icons of Universal's golden age, and combines the two elements for an over-the-top, no-holds-barred fun ride. This is what ""going to the movies"" is supposed to feel like."

","Opening night of Van Helsing I went and saw it with two of my closest friends and did we have a ball with this film!<br/><br/>This movie is beautifully done. From the sets to the acting. All the actors seemed to fit their characters perfectly. Hugh Jackman I had to laugh at for not knowing who the heck he is again in this film after seeing X-men earlier that day in which he doesn't have his memory either. I found him totally believable as the monster hunter and found him quite entertaining in the role. Throughout this horror flick as in The Mummy and The Mummy Returns also directed by Stephen Sommers comedy is brought in by the different characters in this film the comedy relief is Carl played excellently by David Wenham. <br/><br/>But where's a horror flick without a villain or horrifying beasts? In the role of our main villain is Dracula played by the talented Australian actor Richard Roxburgh. This actor has yet another accent to entertain the world with in this film as the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula. (I say another accent because in the other three i've seen him in they're all different!) I'm getting to use to seeing him as a bad guy and still thinks he has done another great job at being the villain. His acting like the others in this film is excellent.<br/><br/>Despite what others may think, I did not find any real ""gore"" throughout this entire film. Blood is seen being drank by the brides of Dracula but that's probably, for me at least, the most realistic looking blood in the whole film. It was also strangely the one that got to me the most as well. There are the fight scenes that are intense at time but not at all bloody. The creatures are not the most realistic things on the block but they are done very well and I am glad they didn't make Dracula's changed form into a tiny bat. A fight between a huge Jackman werewolf and a puny bat would have been more hilarious as well as stupid but I am still impressed with the CGI of the movie. <br/><br/>Women will like this film because of all the attractive male actors in it guys will like it for the action and cleavage from Dracula's brides. Sommers has done it again and I must say seeing this movie was worth getting grounded for. Great job to the cast and crew of Van Helsing."

I enjoyed the Gothic settings as well, with the huge sets, cliffs, great halls, old castles, and grand cathedrals. It was a fun and exhilarating action-horror movie.

","Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"", like his two most previous efforts ""The Mummy"" and its sequel ""The Mummy Returns"", are very good summer fare. The kind of film you can go into with a big bucket of popcorn to enjoy some escapist fun for a few hours. But it is no more than that. Hugh Jackman is good as the title character as well as all the players, but if you're expecting something great, you're in for a very disappointing experience. The plot plays out very much like a Bond film with a loner hero, a beautiful woman ally, an evil megalomaniac intent on ruling the world, and even a lot of high-tech gadgets (which are EXTREMELY implausible for the time period but who cares?). This film has NOTHING to do with realism. This is, as I said, very good escapism. Sommers obviously has great love for the monster movie genre and it is very appropriate that Universal Studios is the studio it comes from since most of the great classic monster movies that this film pays homage to came from this studio seventy years ago. Ironically, however, those classics, who helped to save Universal from the verge of bankruptcy all those years ago, serves as the inspiration for this film whose budget will certainly never be made back from the domestic box-office grosses. But this is really beside the point. If you want to get out of the summer heat and be entertained for a f hours, check your critical brain at the door and have fun."

The banter between the two characters provides the many funny parts of the film. Karl is also the provider of the gadgetry and weaponry used by his friend Van Helsing.<br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh surprised me. Before seeing the film I thought he was badly cast as Dracula, but his performance was a mixture of mad, aristocratic menace and camp egomaniac. The role actually seemed to suit him.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale was the feisty heroine. As Anna Valerious her ancestry indicated a long-standing vendetta with Dracula. She thinks she can handle things on her own, but after seeing Van Helsing in action, she reluctantly agrees the Van Helsing can remain in her town and eventually, together, they set about ""vanquishing evil"".<br/><br/>Will Kemp as the Wolf Man didn't really have much to do with the role, except writhe acrobatically about, which was a shame. I would've liked to have seen more screen time given to both the Wolf Man and Shuler Hensley as Frankensteins' Monster. Although Frankensteins' creation was supposed to be a ""monster"", he was in fact quite the opposite, an emotional and sympathetic character.<br/><br/>The sets were very atmospheric, dark, gloomy and Gothic, perhaps a tribute by the Director Stephen Sommers to the old Hammer Horror films?<br/><br/>The only thing I would've changed about the film? Well, at times, it felt like the film was trying to cram too much in. It would've been nice to have a plot that was less crowded and maybe that would've allowed for some interesting development of the characters.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a lot of things that could've been done differently, but I enjoyed Van Helsing. It's a film that is funny, scary, action-packed thrilling and entertaining all rolled into one."

A lot of detractors are walking around saying things like: predictable, formula, stunts were unbelievable (no! really? and vampires and werewolves are?) but on the whole I liked it. it served it's purpose which was to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>I walked into the cinema. Took a seat. Gulped on my large 1/4 fanta, 3/4 coke concoction that the cinema staff ""just love"" making for me, and lost myself in fantasy until the end credits rolled. Hugh Jackman is always good... I think he is brilliant, but it was the offsider who stole the show in this case. Go Carl. You can doooo eeeeet!<br/><br/>Great effects. Solid camera work.

I've got a friend who has seen tens of films with me at the movies and always managed to have nerves of steel but when the first vampire spawn sprang out he jumped off his seat! He felt really ashamed because I keep refreshing his memory on the incident. He is my horror meter and he went off the top so Van Helsing certainly had it's great horror moments. It is much better than films like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer as thrillers are concerned which give you that one second fright which passes after you munch a bit of popcorn because you feel the atmosphere changing slowly when a scare is coming up (lowering background music and sounds, heavy breathing by a character(s),etc...) and the audience thinks ""Oh no, I forgot to empty my bladder before the film!"". I am a huge vampire-hunting fan and I was really satisfied on the explanations given about vampire slaying (although I have to check the Dracula vs Werewolf legend out). Go see it. It was great fun and I hope that this genre will be revived after many years of abandonment."

","Previous responses, good and bad, covered the gist of the movie fairly well.<br/><br/>That being said, all I can say, is that, somehow, although this flick uses every contrived and hackneyed action/plot technique in the history of film, it comes across as fun and fast paced, unlike say, League of Extraordinary Gentleman, which was nearly the same movie, but for some reason was very slow and boring. Add in amazing scenery, decent but not great use of foreshadowing, attractive actors and actresses, and you have a pleasant way to pass 2 hours on a rainy Sunday. I disagree that this is a good rental. The viewer would lose the benefit of the awesome special effects, unless of course they have a 50"" surround sound entertainment extravaganza at home. Nah, even then, see it the movies, but definitely see it. Just expect to be entertained, nothing more, nothing less."
"Howlin Wolf","7","1","2","7 June 2004"," How anyone can hate a film with such good humour and a sense of fun is beyond me.
","I can certainly reconcile myself with someone's DISLIKE of the film, and I would expect such people not to view if they have a good idea beforehand that this won't light their fire; but I can't understand those who claim to love this type of genre before watching who then precede to rip the film to shreds.  The good humour mentioned in my summary isn't represented by a particular sharpness of script or a reliance on slapstick, but rather a general attitude pervading the film which smacks of those involved having a darn good time.  In the case of director Sommers this manifests itself often in a threatened overdose of CGI, but when the effects are this good such profligacy where they're concerned is hardly a problem.<br/><br/>   The manifesto is clear almost from the start - find a wafer-thin premise with which to allot your ghouls enough screen time and then just let them loose in a suitably gothic arena.  As such, Jackman's Van Helsing often finds himself relegated to the role of a bystander, so perhaps the fact that the film bears his name is a bit of a misnomer; however, like I said, we're pretty much in contrivance territory as far as 'plot development' goes, so it should be seen as just another brand name to hang a silly hat on.  In this regard it may pain Jackman the most, since it leaves him still searching for a leading man role in the style of Crowe's ""Gladiator"" to really leave his print indelibly (""X-Men"" is an ensemble piece.)  His best moment actually comes before the main brawls begin - testing out various items of weaponary Inspector Gadget stylee!<br/><br/>   The lack of focus on the main character shouldn't perturb the audience too much though; if they prepare themselves for a monster royal rumble in the grandest tradition then they should find themselves leaving well satisfied."

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>Those who can cast their minds back to Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 adaptation of Bram Stoker's horror masterpiece Dracula will remember the titular VH as a ragged,dishevelled old fella played by Anthony Hopkins.Here,he's played by the not quite so convincing but more relatably youthful Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>Here,his mission is to travel to Transylvania and assist in the extermination of Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) so that the family of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) may finally see the gates of Heaven.<br/><br/>In it's favour,director Stephen Sommers's film certainly has an interesting,well conceived concept on his hands,not unlike that of last year's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,which I have yet to see.It just doesn't manage to execute it quite as well as it could have.A big part of the problem is really with the script.When it works,it can be fairly engaging and even rather enthralling.When it fails,it is laughably bad,with cast members made to roll off lines of embarrassingly terrible,botched dialogue in as wooden a manner as possible.It blows hot and blows cold as it does,and as such makes the whole story one that doesn't manage to totally engage you throughout.<br/><br/>On the cast front,in the lead role,Jackman is fairly bland and unaffecting,just about competent enough but just not quite giving the role that edge it so badly needed to be brilliant.Beckinsale is voluptuous and has positive sex appeal as the heroine.And Shuler Hensley has an inadvertently appealing role as Frankenstein's monster,managing to illicit a quiet,bumbling sympathy that is quite a pleasant highlight indeed.But then there's Roxburgh's Dracula,who just has this sort of off-putting comic feel to him that really effects the flow of the thing.He fails to be really menacing in any way,like a lighter version of Billy Drago out of Delta Force 2.And that ain't good.<br/><br/>The movie also benefits from some genuinely rather effective jump scenes and some quite impressive action sequences here and there (it would be a summer blockbuster,after all).But on the whole,very watchable though it is,it is never as much fun or as exploitative of it's opportunities as it could have been.It's not particularly bad and not particularly good.And considering what it could have been,ladies and gentlemen,that is what I call one wasted opportunity.***"
"moviefan2003va","7","1","2","3 June 2004"," Okay summer movie
","Contrary to popular opinion, I think Sommers really did want to pay homage to pass horror movies more than make a movie to make money. However, this film is genre specific. If you don't like these kinds of movies and don't come to just have fun then you won't. This won't attract the Mean Girls crowd.  The problem is character development.  The characters like Van Helsing and Anna Valerious do not have time to just gestate and absorb their surrounds before being thrust into another situation. Therefore any display of emotion by these two main characters seems choppy and erratic. I think there is chemistry between Jackman and Beckinsale but it was not necessary to include that kissing scene. There was not enough character development to reach that point before the end of the movie. The one tender moment the two leads are allowed to have is when they are in the rain.<br/><br/>However, summmer movie standards are lower standards and the movie and character development in my opinion is no better than that of The Day After Tomorrow and Troy which suffer from the same problems. If you like this genre and want to have fun then go see it.<br/><br/>The basic story of trying to find a way for Dracula to bring his children to life is fine. The dracula character was decently well thought out and so was Frankenstein who was fabulously played by Hensley.  The friar was great! Igor was fine as well. I also enjoyed the brides.  I didn't have a problem with the accents like others. I appreciated that the actors were consistent in using their accents."
"sunflower1275","Null","1","2","31 May 2004"," Cheers for action and special effects; Jeers for character development - so what?
","True though it is that all of the characters in Van Helsing(including the title role by Mr. Jackman) have less substance than most poorly drawn Saturday Morning heroes, the movie offers one heck of a good time. Why? Because the movie's fresh take on the monsters of classic Hollywood horror are absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>Yes some people have complained about the lack of plot and character development, but let's not forget that the original film depictions of Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein from the 1930s and 1940s were no less superficial. Anyone who has seen The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, or The Scorpion King should know what they're getting in for when they go to a movie of the same genre by the same creative minds behind those three films.<br/><br/>They're going to see a movie that's all about action and special effects with a campy brand of humor in the mix. If that's not your cup of tea, don't see the movie; and by heavens, don't complain about what you saw if you already saw the aforementioned flicks and didn't like them.<br/><br/>I guess it's pretty plain then, that I thoroughly enjoyed The Mummy, its sequel, and its spin-off; I liked this movie even more. Now don't get me wrong, my favorite kinds of movies are the movies that stir your soul and make you think. The Mummy and its follow-ups certainly weren't in that category, and neither was Van Helsing. Val Helsing is the kind of movie you go see when you just want to have some fun. That's what it was, fun like a roller-coaster is fun. Why expect more - that's my question.<br/><br/>Just one more thing about my favorite part of the movie then. The brides of Dracula are the most amazing CG effects of the film. We've never seen creatures like this in any movie. In the same spirit that I watched Disney's Dinosaur and loved it just for the visually stunning CG characters, I love Van Helsing. Going to see the Van Helsing matinee was worth my five bucks just for the artistry that went into bringing the brides of Dracula to life."
"fritzlang","8","1","2","2 June 2004"," Under appreciated fun
","Just came back from seeing this film.  What a blast!  I really don't know what all the critics were complaining about.  Stephen Sommers set out to create an action packed, roller coaster big budget fantasy film with all kinds of creatures, 'cool' special effects, funny lines, and a fun popcorn film.  I think he has succeeded.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is brilliant.  The sets and photography were always fascinating.  And I was never bored for one minute.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot has tons of holes in it - though I found what was there actually entertaining and the few plot twists I thought were actually interesting.  The characters were 2 dimensional.  But who in the world goes to see these kind of films for rich character and plot development?<br/><br/>This film is more of a comedy and satire than a horror film.  Those looking to be scared out of their wits will be very disappointed (though there was at least one scene that made me jump). However, I saw this more in the vein of a modernized ""Abbot & Costello meets Frankenstein"" than anything else. Mr. Sommers also does some great toung-in-cheek fun of Indiana Jones, Star Wars (love those Ewoks!), Alien, Batman, Gremlins, with some very funny lines.  I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard.  And yes, I think these laughs were intentional.  Those who think this is MSK3000 material is missing the humor that is inherent in this film.<br/><br/>In regards to the creatures themselves..Well, I personally found the CGI Mr. Hyde infinitely better than last years Hulk (and funnier too).  I mean, the film opens up with you seeing Mr. Hyde's drawers falling down and you see his butt!  How can anyone think this film was meant to be serious?<br/><br/>The Frankenstein monster was more inspired by Mary Shelly's creature than Karloff's (even the ending was straight out of her book).  And Dracula was an over-the-top satire of Gary Oldman's Dracula from Francis Ford Coppola's version. The Brides were an over the top satire of the Hammer films. The Wolfman was really a nod to the Howling.  So ironically, while this is a Universal film, the creatures pay more homage/satire of other studios.<br/><br/>Yet some of the scenes of the film were straight out of the 30's Universal franchises.  The carriages running through the night.  The mob of villagers storming Castle Frankenstein, etc.  At least I appreciated what Mr. Sommers was trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>I even found the closing credits to be entertaining! (Don't know the last time I could say that).<br/><br/>Yes, one can argue that we have had enough of 'leave your brain at the door' CGI based action films.  And I don't honestly know the replay value of this film.  But if you can go in with the right attitude, you can have a very fun 2 hour ride."

A nice mix of humour, plot and action. The sets are breathtaking, the attention to detail is superb, the film has a very Gothic feel about it and the action is more or less non-stop. The werewolves are very realistic, the change from man to wolf is harrowing and fascinating to watch, similarly the change of the vampires to their flying 'bat' forms are smooth and believable. Dracula's brides in particular are brilliantly scary. There are some gaffes, e.g characters showing knowledge of things that happened when they weren't in the scene but they detracts nothing from the film.

I was a little surprised by all the negative reviews of this movie. The things I read to paraphrase were brain dead unbelievable, bad acting and characterization and too much special effects etc. <br/><br/>Brain Dead? If you go to a movie with Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstein planning to see something believable or profound, you have to be brain dead!<br/><br/>Bad acting and characterization? As someone said before, have you ever heard of a spoof, or a parody? Can you really try to take this movie so seriously when it should be obvious to one and all that the director intended it to be a parody of all the old horror movies.<br/><br/>Too much special effects? The special effects are very impressive but a little to fast moving. Besides, what is wrong with a lot of special effects?<br/><br/>If you are way too anal and go to a movie for a little fun instead of the meaning of life, I guess it has too many fantastic special effects. I believe this movie was intended to be a very fun picture to watch and not a critically acclaimed movie for the ages.<br/><br/>The best way to describe this movie is a young Indiana Jones Van Helsing meets Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstein. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays the Indiana Jones like Van Helsing character with skill bringing a funny and amusing hero character to the movie.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale plays the Xena like heroine Anna Valerious. She is the very sexy and strong woman character (with a bad accent) who is pivotal to the success of defeating Dracula. <br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh plays a credible (if not overly dramatic) Count Dracula.<br/><br/>David Wenham plays the comic genius Friar side-kick of Van Helsing by the name of Carl. <br/><br/>Shuler Hensley plays a credible Frankenstein monster that is a little to wimpy for my taste. <br/><br/>Will Kemp is good as Velkan the werewolf brother of Anna Valerious.<br/><br/>Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran are the very sexy (and whinny) brides of Dracula. <br/><br/>The ending was not as good as it could have been and was a bit too soapy for my taste. <br/><br/>The bottom line. If you like your monster movies, special effects movies, action/adventure movies and very sexy and attractive women, you will love this movie. Be prepared for a fun and visual treat. If you do not like monster movies, special effects movies, and action/adventure movies and would rather see a movie like The Breakfast Club.

"US_Ken_Fan","2","1","2","22 May 2004"," How can it be ""just OK""...when the middle is pretty good, but the end ROTS?
","The scriptwriter apparently began with EXCELLENT ideas...bring several classic horror characters together, create clever mythology to tie the classic ideas together, and create a whole new SERIES of plot twists! If Dracula is not the least bit spooky, this can still make for some pretty good entertainment, right? WRONG!<br/><br/>The beginning of the film impressed me for several reasons; A, the ""myth-twisting"" began right then, and it was pretty darn inventive without being the least bit comical or insulting to the original stories; B, even though the effects looked 100% early-90s (not realistic and very overdone, even laughable), having it shot in black-and-white (or was it done in the editing room?) seemed to balance that out...I could have enjoyed the entire movie that way, though scaling back on the special effects would have made it more realistic and therefore convincing; and C, beginning this movie with a tribute to classic ""Frankenstein"" woven DIRECTLY with the myth-twisting was a true inspiration! But ""Van Helsing"" never delivers.<br/><br/>Let me begin with my #1 complaint: I cannot think of ANY TYPE OF MOVIE that can benefit by giving its viewers pounding headaches, but that's exactly what you get! Every scrape of the sword, every swoop, punch, breakage, thump, shout, or bit of movement in this film is ramped up to full volume, with no discernable purpose. If you want to see ""Van Helsing"" after reading this (if you're looking for a way to waste your money), do yourself a BIG favor...bring Tylenol...LOTS of TYLENOL! The only thing equally annoying is the constant banshee-screaming of the many comical female vampires. This headache is really getting to me now! WHY, OH WHY, DIDN'T I BRING TYLENOL?<br/><br/>Considering that every creature in this film looks like it belongs on a special Halloween edition of ""Nickolodeon"", the action manages to be somewhat impressive at the start, even if it's not the least bit convincing. The action almost NEVER stops...it's the fastest 2 hours and 20 minutes I've ever spent at the movies (even faster than ""The Last Samurai"", which had a LOT quality elements between the few hugely impressive sequences)...so this must mean it's at least a very good movie, right? WRONG AGAIN! An hour after this movie has ended, my heart is still pounding...in tune to my head. By the way, did I mention I had a headache?<br/><br/>Dracula is thin, ugly and whiny, wears an earring, and isn't the least bit spooky. If you think it's impossible to turn the most charismatic, human, and seductive evil creature of all time into a wimpy, white-faced mupped, THINK AGAIN! I would criticize the acting, except that no one is EVER given a chance to act. Maybe he spends too much time with his many banshee-vampiresses. Maybe he has a headache...did I say headache?<br/><br/>More than halfway through this movie, I still thought I would have rated it ""very good"" (maybe 6 or 7, depending how it turned out), simply because the (good) plot slowly unravelled through the film seemed to hint towards a good or possibly better ending. The involvement of a certain religious element with Van Helsing (I'll leave at that, to avoid spoiling what good points there are), was kind of unique, if a little Star Trekkish. In spite of all my complaints (the biggest at this point was still my unanticipated need for Tylenol), several elements still surprised me in a good way. Although, in predictable Hollywood style, the heroine's beauty must be at least equal to her brains and she must fall halfway out of her (inappropriate for her line of work) clothing, this film surprises by giving the most unexpected genius plan totally to the female...not just some hooky swordwork, not just a moment of mild intelligence or bravery in support of our ""real"" (male) hero, but an awesome plan unknown to both the viewer and every male in the film. I thought that was pretty cool. And there's not even any sex, sexual comments, heck, I'm trying to remember if there's even a swear. Things must be looking up, right? WRONG!<br/><br/>Maybe part of the problem is that in the process of twisting together and expanding on the mythologies of several classic monsters, the scriptwriter wrote himself right into a corner. Still, one would think that someone who had the brains to create these ideas would be able to keep some level of suspense through the end of the film. Let's just say that, if this film had a song with lyrics in its soundtrack, country crooner Martina McBride's ""Wrong Again"" would have been entirely appropriate. I know it's possible to reveal the plot ending/solution, ahead of time when necessary and still create a great ending through style and pacing alone...it's been done enough times...but IT DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE. As soon as the Friar figures out the ""solution"", it's ALL downhill. ALL. Everybody connected with the film must have given up, because almost every ""tight spot"" is escaped by crazy coincidence if not complete accident! Forget brains, forget skill...heck, forget brawn! This ""solution"" (which is the missing link in all this myth-weaving) seems to hint at a darn good ending. You can just forget it!<br/><br/>""Van Helsing"" seems to think it can deliver soley on the strength of loud noises, fast (if ridiculous) action, and cartoonish CGI. If you have teenage boys whose sole means of rating a movie is how many times the hero can swing a sword or throw a punch per minute of film...they will still hate this movie! I know this for a fact, because the ones next to me kept making references to the need for a commercial break from about the first 40 minutes through the end of the movie. During the raging, volume-pumped (yeah, they upped it again) 30-minute ""climax"" (NOT!), several sarcastic yawns floated my way. If I'd had any with me, I would have taken the opportunity to pop them some Tylenol."

","I sick and tired of reading people's comments against Van Helsing movie. If you look at trailer it did not say it is Horror movie but that's what people expected. Trailer did not say it was going to be cinematic art but that's what some people were expecting it to be. Come on people that's like going to see a who framed roger rabbit and expecting to be a literacy masterpiece. This movie is plain excitement with action, adventure, special effects, and surprising comedy with some thrills to scare you the kind of Horror that use to scare us when we were kids like old movies. Now a days it take so much to scare us that we don't appreciate the simple scares we want slashing and blood and guts everywhere. Well i've seen enough on news with War so this movie brought me smiles and remembrances of childhood days of simple monsters and with new twists that were surprising and funny. Hugh Jackman was awesome to bring such depth to character."
"laudus","1","1","2","18 May 2004"," Vile Hurling
","This could possibly be the third worst movie I've seen, just ahead of Tango and Cash and Nothing But Trouble. A couple of early lines make you think that it might be a send-up of the horror genre, a la Kill Bill, but that soon devolves into an orgy of CGI and poorly written dialogue. The only amusing performance in the movie is turned in by David Wenham, playing the semi-bumbling sidekick. There is nothing that this film delivers that you didn't see last summer...or the summer before that. If you really must see it, wait for pay-per-view and watch it only if there's nothing but info-mercials on every channel on the grid. The best moments of this movie were the ones I spent in the restroom."

","Van Helsing<br/><br/>Genre: Action/Adventure/Horror/Fantasy/Thriller<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for Nonstop Creature Action Violence, Frightening Images and Sensuality<br/><br/>Starring: Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh, David Wenham, Samuel West, Will Kemp and Josie Maran<br/><br/>Star Rating: ****1/2 out of 5<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing, who some say that Van Helsing is murder and some say he is a monster hunter and to him it is both. During the late 19th Century Van Helsing heads to the Eastern Europe otherwise known as Transylvania to battle Count Dracula (Roxburgh), Frankenstein and Wolf Man. Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious who happens to be a princess of a royal family and her parents were killed and all there was left was her and her brother. This movie kept shocking me out of my seat every time when there was a scary part coming up and you don't know what is going to strike! I thought some of the weapons the Van Helsing used were pretty cool like this one weapon that is a crossbow but it can shoot arrows like a machine gun!<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING: Van Helsing gets bitten by a werewolf and then he turns into a werewolf while he is fighting Dracula in the final battle!<br/><br/>Another thing is that I thought Josie Maran was very sexy as a vampire when she was a vampire bat she didn't look good then but when she was back into a vampire she looked sexy. I also thought Hugh Jackman did a great job at Van Helsing because he plays a lot of good main role characters and I thought he was also good in the X-Men movies doing Wolverine! Also, can you believe that Kate Beckinsale was doing this movie while she was filming Underworld at the same time? I know I can't especially with having to be playing a vampire hunter in one movie and then switching to a human character in the other.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: HUGH JACKMAN HAS DONE ANOTHER GREAT ROLE AGAIN!"
"emikulina","8","1","2","18 May 2004"," Clever, funny and visually impressive
","'Van Helsing' is currently playing in Russian theatres and I already saw it two times. Reason #1: it is very cleverly done - with lots of context from other movies and books of this sort - starting with 'Frankenstein' and all the 'Draculas' and ending with such recent things as 'James Bond' and 'X-Men' (natural, as it too has Hugh Jackman). Reason #: it is very funny - the dialogue and, again, the context in which protagonists find themselves. Special effects are impressive as well. Acting is not really in option in such films, but Hugh Jackman is good and sexy, and Roxbourgh makes for a very unusual Dracula. Camera work is good as well - moody and professional, a little bit like in 'Sleepy Hollow'. And the whole movie certainly leaves you romantically exited - all these jumps, fights and full-moon transformations make one think as one is a teenager again. Clever, funny and visually impressive film - at LEAST 7/10!"
"JohnBoyRoy","7","1","2","18 May 2004"," For fans of the classics!
","For anybody who is familiar with the old Universal monster movies Van Helsing is a total roller-coaster, taking all of the aspects that made the vintage films great, and injecting them with LSD, speed and pyro.<br/><br/>The CGI, firstly, is at least complete this time, unlike the decidedly PS2 graphics like SCorpion King from the Mummy sequel. Particularly impressive are the werewolf transformations and the vampiric healing abilities.<br/><br/>Jackman carries his charisma well across the film, but unfortunately Beckinsale has none of the English charm that Sommers saw in Rachel Weisz - if only she would have done this one for him.<br/><br/>The design and shooting of the action sequences is absolutely perfect -everything can be seen in it's full glory - it's all physically plausible (within the context of action/adventure!) and it never fails to surprise.<br/><br/>David Wenham's character has a couple of good lines but he's generally pointless but fun (a bit like the film I suppose).<br/><br/>A great ride with a few surprises, the film can't really be called frightening, but it's definitely worth a look for action fans and lovers of the brilliant 'The Mummy'.<br/><br/>6/7-10"

"reinedelamonde","7","1","2","15 May 2004"," Good Acting, Good Plot, Good Music (SPOILER!!!)
","'Van Helsing' is one of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time. I'm pretty picky in my movie viewing, so I don't go out to the theater very often. The plot lines, musical scores and delicious acting is what makes this one of my top choices of films. There are a lot of unexpected twist and turns (the Angel Gabriel turning into a werewolf?) that even made me nod my head and applaud. I think what I loved most about this film(not the graphics.... they were well, good. at best. I'm no longer impressed with Computer Generated Imagery or C.G.I. for short) is the superb acting by the cast. The first bit of credit goes to David Wenham. It took me about 10 minutes of his acting to actually realize that this was the same person that played one of my favorite characters in the Lord of The Rings. His quirky comic relief was commendable. I think my favorite actor was the one who played Dracula. He seemed to envelope the role as his own (as a good actor should).<br/><br/>I cannot express my adoration of the musical score of this film. For me, the score of a film is an important part on how the audience reacts, whether or not they notice it. Keeping up with the action on screen, this adds a definite gothic feel to the movie. My favorite element of this score was the chanting. I will definitely have to add it to my soundtrack collection.<br/><br/>Granted, the whole werewolf thing was a LITTLE cheesy (I can see the headlines now:""Wolverine Turns Werewolf in this Action/Adventure!"") but it can be forgiven.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a good movie. If a good mix of thrills, laughs and a new twist on some old stories is what you're looking for, this film is definitely it."

","Boring, loud, all character removed in favor of bigger special effects which no one has yet to prove actually translate into box office dollars.  I'm secure in my masculinity and all, but it's a sad state of affairs when I'm sitting there less than 45 minutes into it, thinking, ""Holy crap, these costumes are AWFUL.""<br/><br/>Which, y'know, they ARE... sorry dude, that gigantic hat make you look like a mushroom.  And don't decorate the front of the Hot Female Lead's corset with little red circular designs... they tend to look like something else.<br/><br/>It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but for the money they spent on it, the producers will burn even lower in Hell than the people who greenlit ""From Justin to Kelly.""  Stephen Sommers had a good start with ""The Mummy,"" but now just covers his lazy butt with as much CGI as humanly possible. And that is the single laziest thing a filmmaker can do.  Knock it off."

","Some nice tributes to the old films. Thought Dracula was way too campy even for this.CGI intensive and a few spring out shocks. I liked movies when people did stunts. Although the CGI effects just keep getting better and better when you watch an older movie it was so much more tense when you knew it was an actual person doing the stunt. I'd like them to do a Wolfman movie with a more serious take on it as the opening Wolfman capture was quite exciting. I guess this was okay for todays 13 year-olds, probably even 10 year olds. By the end I was tired of so many fantastic jumping and flying tricks. Are there really that many people who get off on this phony looking stuff? But it was entertaining and I like Hugh Jackman and I just want Kate Beckinsale very badly. She has the power to cloud my mind and make me loose all reason. Dear Kate, if you should read this and should your new husband ""disappear from the top of the wedding cake"" please be in touch. I'm older and not rich or good looking but wouldn't that be a refreshing change of pace?"

","Got into the theatre by chance and went in only to see Hugh Jackman in one more movie, but didn't regret a second. The action grabs you from the first second to the last. Excellent camera work, compares only with LOTR and Hulk, but here it is a 2 and a half hour non-stop swirling and jumping and what-not. Costumes and cast are excellent. Hugh Jackman confirmed he is a good actor, and all the rest are fine. Minor complaints - at times the animation is not seamless, and action is just a bit too much. Warning - don't see it if you scare easily. No doubt one of the best movies for the year. Much better than Troy anyway. 8/10"

","I can't believe the people who took this movie too seriously.  This movie is a lot of fun.  Granted the movie runs too long and the ending is not really satisfactory.  The movie does move very fast and Hugh Jackman is great as the title role.  I also like Kate Beckinsale as a princess that helps him. The villains are also quite good.  However, if you have Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's monster in the same movie, what are you going to do for a sequel?  I suppose it doesn't matter.  I suggest you go see this movie and ignore what the critics are saying. I give it a 7/10 with a big grin on my face.  Just see this movie and decide for yourselves.   It won't redefine movie making, but it is a great start to the summer movie season."
"cobra-8","10","1","2","13 May 2004"," Move over Buffy, bring on Van Helsing
","This was a brilliantly exciting movie. The whole time it kept me guessing what was going to happen next. It incorporates my two favourite classic monsters, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and the Wolfman (Will Kemp). It throws Frankenstein's Monster into the mix as well, and the three stories are all very well combined.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find David Wenham in the movie, and even more so to find him providing the comic relief. He changed since LotR - from tall, elegant warrior to squat, eccentric monk - er, friar.<br/><br/>All the actors/tresses delivered smashing performances. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) was a very 1800's James Bond. Anna (Kate Beckinsale) was quite fiery. Dracula was perfectly evil. Carl (David Wenham) was great for a good laugh. Finally, Dracula's brides (Elena Alaya, Josie Maran, and Silvia Colloca) were spectacularly sexy, possibly the most so I've seen in cinema yet.<br/><br/>The previews make it out to have no plot whatsoever, but that is not the case. The plot was not *terribly* intricate, but juicy enough to disqualify the movie from the ""mindless action"" category. I recommend this movie to those who are looking for a pulse-pounding, dryly comic, and suspenseful ride.<br/><br/>Once again, this was a great film."
"banzhafsb","10","1","2","12 May 2004"," Come on people...
","I don't know what people have against this movie.  First off, critics always hate movies that turn out to be good or enjoyable, it's just a fact.  So I never listen to movie critics, I only go off of what my friends tell me about stuff.  But I seriously loved this movie.  Same thing happened with The Punisher, terrible reviews but I thought it was awesome.  Anyways, I'm not going to summarize the entire movie, just some characters.  Hugh Jackman (whom I love as an actor) as Van Helsing is awesome.  I read reviews comparing him to Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and saying that he wasn't as memorable.  That's just plain dumb, because it wasn't until after at least the 2nd Indiana Jones movie that people found Indiana Jones to be a one of a kind character.  Anyways, I thought he did a great job, and he brought a lot of fun and excitement to the screen.  David Wenham as Carl was great, he was awesome as Faramir in the Lord of the Rings, and he was great in Van Helsing.  He provides some comic relief as Carl, and I loved it.  Now for my favorite part: Kate Beckinsale.  Ok, to begin with Kate Beckinsale is pretty easily one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen between those I've met/seen in real life and in movies and television.  But in this movie in particular, everything about her makes me drool.  The outfit, the hair, the make up, and especially the accent, all just, wow.  I seriously cannot stop thinking of it.  But anyways, even though she'll likely receive little to no credit for her role as Anna Valerious, she did an incredible job. Anyways, I've seen this twice now, and I still love it.  So for those of you who are looking to see a fun and enjoyable movie, see this one.  If you're looking for a George Lucas or Peter Jackson masterpiece, you're going to be disappointed.  But this movie serves it's purpose in my mind."

","What a flawless movie! I think it's the best movie I've ever watched after 'Titanic', I just can't get my mind out of the movie these days, I like vampire movies and this is the most outstanding one because of the three beautiful 'brides' appeared in it, they were so sexy and attractive that at the first time when Aleena changed from flying-vampire into human, everyone in the theatre made a 'WOW~~' sound. I like Hugh also, he looks so handsome in the movie. And Roxburgh is the best 'Dracula' I've ever seen, he makes Dracula not only the king of all vampires, but also the man that all the women wanna be with."
"israelx7","Null","1","2","12 May 2004"," Tongue in cheek, stops short of a spoof
","Very James Bond beginning. Special effects are interesting, sometimes a little less than perfect (Van Helsing jumping from horse to horse to return to carriage) Story is relatively uninspired but interspersed with enough action and amusing dialogue to entertain. At one point Dracula pleads with his lycanthropic adversary and appeals for a truce on the grounds that ""we could be friends"". The count is played with a great deal of his tongue stuffed in his cheek, and is never frightening, despite his metamorphosis into something less than human...no scares here, just the startle that comes from the typical ""boo"" devices...no one is going to go home and wonder what that vaguely menacing shadow could be in their closet. It was just OK."
"pjshouse","Null","1","2","12 May 2004"," A film CAN be pure entertainment...
","...and ""Van Helsing"" most certainly was.  There have been many complaints about this movie, with the message board discussions sounding more like the squabbling of children than mature discourse over a film.<br/><br/>This movie was outlandish, and unbeliveable, with characters and a story that was bigger than life.  Which is exactly what it was supposed to be. These characters are fictional - they never existed.  It was a mindless diversion, and suspension of disbelief is required throughout.<br/><br/>Having said that, let me get on to the good parts, and I believe that there were many.  From the opening in black and white, which was clearly an Homage to the Original ""Frankenstein"" with the versatile and sadly missed Boris Karloff, this movie sets the tone for the audience.  Its over-the-top, and wants us to take it seriously, but not TOO seriously.  This is a similar tone that was set with the director's two previous movies ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns,"" and its not unrealistic to make comparisons between the two.  Namely, if you liked those movies, you will like Van Helsing; if you did not, then you will probably not like this movie.  From there we are introduced to our hero, played by the also (surprisingly) versatile Hugh Jackman.  He's tall, with long sable hair, dressed in a long leather trench coat and all but has the words ""drool over me ladies, I am the studly, virile, action hero"" stamped on him.<br/><br/>I will refrain from giving a complete summary of the movie, because you should judge the movie on its own merits rather than any positive or negative commentary about the plot or any technical issues that you may have with the film (apparently there were color distortions in some of the European prints, and the boom mike is visible in some of the shots, but I did not see any of that).<br/><br/>In short, an enjoyable movie.  If you look for a grand message or try to find holes in the plot (*POSSIBLE SPOILER* Why did he see two full moons so closely together?  He was in Transylvania almost a month), please bear in mind that you are seeing a movie about creatures that do not exist in real life.  Enjoy the movie for its grand spectacle and great visuals, rich scenery and colorful characters, and let it go at that.<br/><br/>I give it 9.5 out of 10, and yes I AM going to see it again."

","I cannot believe what I have read about the movie Van helsing.  Obviously all of these people who think that they are an authority on movies (usually under 25 years of age with no life experience) have no idea that a movie is for enjoyment and the reason that we go to the cinema is for the experience of it.  Not to sit and pick actors ability (when they have never acted themselves).  I found Van Helsing to be highly entertaining.  The lines that David Wenham had were hilarious. To give a movie such a bad rap is such an egotisical, self-centred approach to life.  I don't think of myself as a movie critic, I am there to enjoy myself.  If people have the time to write such a report (which I stumbled across by accident) then they need to get a life and realise that most of the world does not want to listen to their opinion.  Van Helsing was a great movie and should be enjoyed by all not critised.  Hugh Jackman was fantasic!"
"lwbrass78","Null","1","2","12 May 2004"," Suspension of Disbelief
","The criticism that has been linked to ""Van Helsing"" has gotten to the unreasonable level.  There is a statement used when viewing science fiction / fantastic works: ""The suspension of Disbelief"".  Essentially there are some realities that need to be overlooked when viewing set work (Van Helsing).  The one that come foremost to mind is relation of time.<br/><br/>1) The span of time between the full moons is not continuous chain, therefore the passing of even a month between Van Helsing's arrival to the town and his own turning can be ignored.  2) As for the chime of 1 through 12 of the clock, many large clock towers can take up 12 minutes to ring twelve times.  This is still a stretch to imagine this happening in only twelve minutes, but as a friend of mine would say ""There are werewolves fighting Vampires and friars having sex, but this is the part that you choose not to believe.""  Suspend your disbelief on the little stuff, and eventually you might go to a movie that you would enjoy.<br/><br/>p.s.

Yes, it is loud and there is a few silly moments but pretty much every movie has those and No, it doesn't dwell much on character development, but why would you want it to, it's a freaking monster movie not Gone With The Wind.

I mean, come on, nobody expected a well-thought story! Yes, the story is stupid. Yes, there are more than a few plot holes. Yes, the romanian accents were awful.

Even and the music was ok!<br/><br/>So why bash this movie ?!? If you expected more than it delivered, it's actually your fault, isn't it?

","OK Folks I am very tired of people ripping on this movie. I'll be honest it does have its sappy moments. However, it does not deserve the flames it has been getting. First off the choice to use black and white for the first few minuets is strongly trying to tell the viewer that you are going back to a time in Hollywood's history were what we have come to expect will not apply here. Any one who has viewed the interviews of Summers will know the he was a huge fan of the old B movie horror classics that Hollywood put out so long ago. This movie is his chance to show us that vision. In addition the man can't let his humor not shine through every chance he gets. ""In the name of Allah, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!"" in the current political times that line would not be taken as humor but in the situation you help but laugh. This move is not meant to be a land mark in Hollywood history nor is it meant to be even a best picture attempt. This movie asks you to suspend what beliefs and bias you may have and to simply sit back and enjoy a visually entertaining story.<br/><br/>Again Spoilers<br/><br/>For one of the previous commentators I would ask that they think about their comments. Creaturecicle can you think of any other way to transport that guy long term. The whole bride thing and girl running around outside.

Honestly, how many minutes and hours, and how much of an effort have you used bashing it?  Do you not consider this time wasted?  And why not? Because it was the opportunity to bash something you may never do, or be good at if you did do?<br/><br/>It was good to me.  Mainly because the true purpose of films/movies is to create a world (real or contrived) and remain true to it.  I specifically refer to this movie as a movie and not as a film (ask me why another time). It is a summer movie too!  C'mon!  The world of the movie was created in the first scene; it was even a completely filtered scene. I mean, stop the madness."
"scullie","Null","1","2","11 May 2004"," Van Helsing: Modern Classic
","For all the horror/adventure films that have been released of late, this one, stands alone.  From wonderful omages to the classics horror films like Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstien, to the quickly paced action, that so many of todays movie goers crave, this film did not disappoint.  Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham feel natural together, not forced. My only concern was the CGI graphics.  The werewolf effects are the best to date, but still lack the real feeling of flesh and bone. In my opinion, they should have combined the wolf effects with model features to bring it more to life.  All in all this is a great summer film.  My friends and I loved it and will see it again.  Like the classic films it has represented, this is a modern Classic."
"Mylene-2","1","1","2","11 May 2004"," In your face Special Effects
","First let me give you a frame of reference as to some of the movies that I have liked in the past, ""Pitch Black"", ""Underworld"", ""The Matrix"", ""13 Going on 30"", ""Dracula"" (the original), ""Tombstone"", ""Cat People"", ""An American Werewolf in London"" and on and on.  Some of these movies had special effects, but the difference between these movies and ""Van Helsing"", is these movies had plot and acting.<br/><br/>Too many movies rely on special effects and this one was definitely in that category.  Why does Hollywood think we want to watch a video game? Because that's what today's special effects are giving us in the movies.  Wouldn't Mr. Hyde have been more believable and frightening if they had chosen a massive actor with an evil demeanor instead of a video game looking character.  And an authentic fight scene is always more enjoyable without special effects (or at least a minimum).<br/><br/>Within 30 minutes, I was tempted to leave and go into a different movie (wish I had!). Maybe this one did have plot, but it definetly had no depth. I didn't enjoy it and would not recommend the movie to anyone!"

","After years of neglect, the three great Universal Studios monsters composed of werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula make their triumphant return in Stephan Summer's Van Helsing. A movie driven by it's mind blowing action, revolves around the vampire hunter created by Bram Stoker in 1897, Gabriel Van Helsing, who originally aided Jonathan Harker and others in defeating Dracula in the classic tale. In this tale, a younger version of Van Helsing hunts various monsters as he is employed by a secret order out of the Vatican. In the beginning, Count Dracula is employing Dr. Frankenstein in making his creature. Just before Dracula kills Dr. Frakenstein, Dracula reveals the motive for the creation of the monster: to help aid the breeding of vampires, to help his species survive. Afterwards Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) returns to the Vatican. His new assignment is to go to Transylvania to save the Valerious family from condemnation to hell, the cost after a pact with God to take down Dracula. Only two members of the family are still alive but one has turned into a werewolf. The lone Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is left, and is saved by Van Helsing and his 007 Q- like companion the friar Carl (David Wenham). Along the way they encounter Frankenstein's monster and attempt to stop Dracula's plan to use the monster to raise thousands of vampire offpsring. Overall Van Helsing is not as bad as others are saying.  There's explosive special effects, and despite the low amount of plot involved, it's a great action movie for the start of summer. - Joe M.

","I think the reason that people are giving VH the raspberry is that they are presented with mismanaged expectations.  This movie is a campy B horror movie with $100+ million dollar special effects and tons of one-liners. The trailers lead the viewer to believe that it is a high budget thriller that honestly tries to scare....it is not. To substantiate, my family and I found ourselves laughing outloud at genuinely funny jokes 9 or 10 times throughout the movie when no one else in the theatre was laughing-I guess they just werent expecting comedy. The effects throughout the movie were stunning to say the least.  The werewolf had moments where he looked very poorly animated, but the vampires and their morphing was seamless. Jackman looked great, and Kate B. (WOW!) These roles certainly didnt stretch the acting abilities of these folks, but this movie isnt about deep dialog.

","This movie, while lots of fun and very entertaining, is basically the Mummy remade with Dracula now playing the role of the antagonist and Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing taking over for Brendan Fraser's tough guy hero Rick O'Connell. The filmmakers even use the same evil assistant  (both played by Kevin J. O'Connor) in the persons of Igor in ""Van Helsing"" as opposed to Beni in ""The Mummy"". That being said, this movie stands very well on its own. It's exciting, action packed, suspenseful, has the necessary eye candy in Kate Beckinsale's heroine and Dracula's brides, and has just the appropriate amount of humor thrown in, and is even a little scary at times. All in all, it's well worth the price of admission."

The movie plot does surround Dracula but the other two monsters really get plenty of screen time, especially the Wolf Man.

"AER_Wilmington","9","1","2","8 May 2004"," Do not deride this movie for being enjoyable...
","Van Helsing is, if nothing else, thoroughly enjoyable. No one in their right mind would have gone in expecting 'Interview with the Vampire.' This is, in truth, an action movie - and the plot reflects that. It is there, undeniably, to feed the action.<br/><br/>And the action is good. The special effects are a bit cheesy at points (the brides-of-Dracula in flight, for instance), but it evokes adrenaline. It is fun to watch! What could be more important in a movie, really?<br/><br/>
Now, this may destroy any credibility that I still have in the minds of some, but I also liked The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - for similar reasons. Van Helsing is like LXG on steroids: better effects, better plot (admittedly, that is not saying much), and - most importantly - even more monsters. It is like a fun ride at an amusement park."
"mikemaddogadams","10","1","2","8 May 2004"," A contemporary classic?
","What an excellent matinee movie! Aside from a bit of weak dialogue and a question I have about one of the major action sequences this James Bond/Indiana Jones meets the monsters of Universal Studios really delivered the goods for me.  Pure escapism and mind-boggling special effects from start to finish.  I felt that the film remained true to the spirit and heritage of the great classic Universal flicks with a clever nod to the Hammer Studio vampire films of the 60's. Van Helsing is not a horror movie so much as it is a monster/action movie. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the Frankenstein monster character.  I also felt that the sensuality of vampirism was deftly handled considering the makers were going for a PG rating. I can't decide whether two of the very final scenes were an homage or just plain pop-corny but given the spirit of the film I guess they worked. Van Helsing far surpassed my expectations so much so that I plan to go back to the theatre and see it again...something I haven't done in a very, very long time. Try to catch the DLP version it is visually stunning. I hope for a sequel!"
"Aaron1375","8","1","2","11 May 2004"," A very good action movie...just not much of a plot.
","I enjoyed this movie for the most part, it went by quick and was almost entirely action.  However, the plot could have used a lot of work.  Not the best put together movie I have ever seen and I would not think it would be that hard to put these horror legends together and have a credible plot, but I just did not care for Dracula's big plan.  James Bond villains have better plans than the one we were presented with here.  Still though the action was great and Hugh Jackman was good in the title role, though I would take Peter Cushing over him as my personal favorite.  I wish they had cast someone bigger in the Dracula role though, the guy they got was okay, but Oldman was better in the role than the one we get here.  Sure I know you can not use Christopher Lee anymore, but someone a touch more big in Hollywood would have been better.  But then there are not really all that many big stars for horror movies like there were back in the day.  My best advice is that if you liked the Mummy movies then you are more likely to like this one because they are similar.  If you did not like them then I know you will not like this one so skip it.  It is also best just to turn your brain off and just enjoy the action."
"elispaul","7","1","2","11 May 2004"," Garish, loud, silly....and a lot of fun.
","I have never been a fan of the brainless summer film.  That isn't to say that summer film's are, as a rule, brainless.  Over the past few years we've been treated to some very well-written, thoughtful popcorn movies during the summer movie season and this year promises some of wonderful potential. However, movies like ""Armageddon"", ""The Mummy Returns"" and ""Mission: Impossible 2"" have left me cold and looking for the exit sign.  I willingly admit that ""Van Helsing"" shares far more in common with these movies than it does the more intelligent summer films, but for some bizarre reason, I found myself smiling a lot during the film.  Yes, it's obnoxiously loud.  Yes, there are plot holes you could drive a semi through.  Yes, the acting ranged from O.K. to MST3K atrociousness.  But the sets are fantastic, the atmosphere inviting and...darn it all...the bad stuff was entertainingly bad.  In fact, it seemed intentional.  The thick-as-pine-sap accents were completely in keeping with the goofy tone that underlines the entire movie. The jokes are broad and the pace is brisk.  The deliberate stagey nature of the movie is obviously in homage to the old horror films that inspired it. It may not be as smart as they were, but it doesn't want to be.  This may be the best brainless summer film I've ever seen.  Most likely because it has no intention of even trying to be anything else."
"thousandisland","7","1","2","11 May 2004"," Proudly in the ""Liked It"" Camp !
","NO SPOILERS. NONE !! Charge forth !! <br/><br/>I was pretty sure (nay, *positive*) that I was going to hate this one. Well, it's another CGI Action movie (budget was over $150 mil, so you know what's coming), as has become the trend recently, and I generally hate those. <br/><br/>This one would be a flop without Hugh Jackman, but thankfully he's here and looking better than ever, and playing something like a shallow version of Wolverine. The movie is an aggregate of several types: A vampire movie, an action movie, a classic monster movie, and an Eye Candy movie that totally delivers. MOST of the effects are pretty good - only a handful miss the mark, and Jackman, well... He is the Ultimate Eye Candy, especially when clad in Turn of the Century romanticism. The female viewers will surely be satisfied (no complaints here on the detailed leather costumes, glittering weapons, and flowing black cloaks!) and the vampire people and action movie buffs will get their fill, too.<br/><br/>Some aspects of it are annoying, like the constant use of computer effects, unfortunately at the expense of dialogue and character development. And that strangling outfit Beckinsale wears is ugly and eventually irritating to look at. Some of the dialogue is a little ""off,"" too, but I guess that's to be expected in this type of flick. <br/><br/>Where you'd expect it to crash, 'Van Helsing' does provide a detailed and almost believable plot that gives the monsters credible reason to interact. There were a few times during the screening I attended when you could hear people muttering worried ""Oh no""s at the key points of the story; the thing was pretty darn involving, perhaps disturbingly so.<br/><br/>It was obvious that some explanatory scenes had been sharply cut (unfortunately), but the film was coherent and tended to answer its various questions as it went along. It was nice to see the characters and the audience simultaneously confused over certain plot elements, and then learn the reasons together. <br/><br/>Most of all, 'Van Helsing' could have been helped by fewer effects and much more dialogue. And as others have mentioned, it goes too far toward making the main characters invincible. Part of a great action movie is a great hero (and a beautiful co-star and a bumbling sidekick, of course), but that relies on his being human enough to fail sometimes and feel pain, or at least lie on the ground for a while after he's taken such a pummeling. Maybe that is the distance between Van Helsing and Wolverine.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a terrific, guilty pleasure, even for someone who isn't into monster flicks. Go for the antiquity, the scenery, the incredible costumes and cool weaponry, and an awesome Dracula, too!<br/><br/>Score: A solid ""B,"" for doing what it sets out to do."

Maybe that's why I'm not severely disappointed by the film.  I thought the effects were great.  I didn't have many problems with the overall plot.  The one scene I HATE was at the end, the faces in the sky...that was a bit much. I guess it was to show that Kate Beckinsale was reunited with her family.  I was kind of surprised by the fact that she in fact died at the end, but then again, Van Helsing shouldn't live life happily ever after.

I think, the worst thing was the syncro into german, or some silly dialogues. But, there were also some good things to mention: The end was surprisingly, the characters are interesting and overall it was a good pop-corn-movie but only a second class film. I was a little bit disappointed about some silly parts, especially the questions ""Why Count Dracula tried to get children?"" or ""Why only the Wolf Man can kill the Count?"" or even why the story of Van Helsing's past hasn't been answered completely.

The vampires in the movie, especially the females are all very annoying and I prefer my vampires to be more seductive and suave ( like Underworld ). This was the part that I did not expect. However, the movie itself was just brilliant. Van Helsing was well acted and a great caracter. The story unfolds with a twist I had not seen coming. The story is not easy to understand, so I can understand that some people might not get the hints in the movie. You actually need to pay attention to the details to get to know what is going on. That is what made the movie special. The universe created was just brilliant and well drawn and the special effects were superb. Of course, everyone would recognize the familiar caracters from LXG and The Mummy, but that should not be a bad thing. The movie is originial and has an interesting new take on the van Helsing caracter we all know from books and movies such as Dracula.

"allykat_d","7","1","2","7 May 2004"," More to it than you think.... SPOILERS ...
","Let me say up front that I loved this movie.  I haven't had as much fun at a movie theatre in years.  This movie is pure story telling spectacle at its finest.  Total entertainment.  This, to me, is the purpose of a movie: go get lost for two hours and forget about everything else, forget about the world and get lost in a fantasy. Van Helsing did that for me.  There were tons of CG but it fit the story and never detracted from it.  However, I believe there's more to this movie, an added layer, that will pass over most viewers' heads.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD....  although they'll make you want to go back and watch the movie again...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There has been complaints/criticisms/mutterings about Van Helsing's identity.  Given the clues in the movie it's very clever what Stephen Sommers has done.<br/><br/>The reason Van Helsing cannot remember his family and the reason he was found on the steps of the Vatican is because Van Helsing is an angel cast down from Heaven.<br/><br/>I kid you not.<br/><br/>Gabriel is one of the highest-ranking angels in Christian, Judaism and Mohammedan religious lore.  He is the angel of vengeance, death, and resurrection.  Gabriel is said to sit on the left-hand side of God (remember in the movie the Left Hand of God killed Dracula during the first go-round). Now here is the important part:  Gabriel is also identified as a man-God-angel and in Babylonian legend he fell into disgrace for not obeying a command exactly as given, and for that was cast down from heaven.<br/><br/>
I think what Sommers was getting at is that the last command Gabriel disobeyed was one relating to his battle with Dracula.  For that he was cast out of heaven with no memories of who (or what) he is.<br/><br/>Dracula recognized him as the man whom almost killed him, yet, if Gabriel was that man, he would be dead from old age.  So my theories make sense. Gabriel can't age; he's not human-at least not entirely.  I have to wonder if that explains his werewolf at the climatic scene, how he was bigger, more powerful then the others and able to resist Dracula's commands.  A battle of Titans!  The devil vs. heaven.  Although Van Helsing may be mostly mortal at this point, he still retains a spark of what he once was: The Angel of Death and Vengeance.  He is doing what he was created to do and is perhaps more effective on Earth than in Heaven.<br/><br/>If you see the movie with this knowledge, it gives the movie an added layer above the spectacle and FX.  Watch for the clues, such as Dracula mentioning how human heartbeats increase when he is close and how Van Helsing's does not.  Listen carefully to the message of the  picture behind the wood panel. Note that Van Helsing can see Anna Valerious ascend to heaven, and that Carl (the monk played by David Wenham) can not.   Very cool.   Maybe there are more clues that I missed.<br/><br/>I'm going to see it again and get as many people rounded up as possible to see it with me.<br/><br/>-Allykat"
"janne_w","10","1","2","7 May 2004"," I go to movies to enjoy them... and I did enjoy Van Helsing!
","I was prepared not to like this movie because of the hype. I'm married to a Vampire Move Lover. I like them too, but really like romance, if there is also something else going on. We both enjoyed this movie! Not only was the movie beautifully made as far as effects, but the people in the movie were also beautiful in their own right. I can't imagine anyone leaving in the middle of this movie, because if they did, they obviously did the movie a great disservice. The best of it was in the middle and toward the end. Of course, to each his own. If anyone is to give a summary of a movie, it stands to reason that they would at least give it a complete summary. Anything less is rather absurd, and gives the summary a condescending feeling... at least to me. My thoughts: Roxburgh was the most beguiling Dracula I have ever seen, from the way he pronounced his name to the way he obviously felt fear and pain when confronted with Van Helsing in the final moments. That was a surprise. Yes, I found it scary, but not in a terrifying way... in a ""this is a semi-serious horror movie with special effects and lots of little surprises"" way.<br/><br/>Okay... my 12 year old daughter wasn't scared by the movie, but thrilled is a better word. She jumped, shrieked, and even laughed. Is that so bad? No, it's not the Exorcist of the Vampire world... it's a well done story of the timeless legends of Vampires and their brethren... in a fantasy world that I found captivating, and fun. There wasn't an overabundance of blood, though I found the scene in the vampire ""nursery"" a big icky... The little bit of romance there was tended to be more a thought than an action... and was a nice side trip to the fast paced action elsewhere.<br/><br/>Overall - I loved it and really do believe it earned all 10 of the stars I gave it. I want to see it again already, and I just got home from the theater a little while ago."
"editor-92","7","1","2","7 May 2004"," Very dark and comical
","I noticed that a lot of people don't like this film because of all of the special effects. Although I agree that they should stop making Hyde as a CGI creature (he was equally naff in LXG) I don't mind the effects. In fact, I didn't mind the film.<br/><br/>Anyone going to this film and expecting anything other than complete mind candy should be slapped repeatedly. If you don't want to switch off your brain and enjoy some dark - but cool images - then find another film. Remember this comes to you from the guy who did the Mummy. He's obviously a classic film buff, because he doesn't come up with an original idea. Which I think is OK. Indiana Jones comes straight out of classic Hollywood and no one beats up Lucas and Spielberg over that. Not that I'm comparing this film to Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's nowhere in that league.<br/><br/>
My biggest complaint about this film is that it makes the villain too attractive. I like Hugh Jackman, but Richard Roxburgh makes Dracula so enticing that I was hoping he and his awesome flying brides would triumph. The casting of this show seems to be a bit of an in joke. Kate Beckinsale's last film, Underworld, had her as a vampire fighting werewolves and that's kind of important to this film.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has played Wolverine, a man in search of his ""lost past"" and here he does a similar turn. (There's another similarity that I won't spoil.)<br/><br/>The best in this film, though, is David Wexham, who played Faromir in LOTR. He's almost unrecognizable as the friar sidekick and he gets the best lines. (I noticed that I was often the only one laughing, though.)<br/><br/>If you're hung up on finding a ""great film,"" just realize that Hollywood is making them anymore. Van Helsing, is however, a fun and visually stunning substitute."

","If you are a fan of the classic horror films, you will enjoy this film. Van Helsing does its work with its epic soundtrack, lively characters, and jaw-dropping special effects.  However, there are things wrong with it. The best way to give it an honest review is to break it up by its characters.<br/><br/>
Van Helsing: Well portrayed, but the back story was rather choppy, and made little sense.  Anna: Kate Beckinsale makes a viewer fall in love with that face, body, and physicality.  The trailer does not give her justice--the accent is much improved.  Dracula: Richard Roxburgh had the opportunity to perhaps be ranked in the top 3 Draculas of all time.  Though, for what he had (another illogical storyline and at times lackluster lines), he did well.  His CGI was above average.  Frankenstein's Monster: An overdramatic portrayal by Shuler Hensley.  Get past that, and you have another fine character.  The Wolfman: Will Kemp is very good in his movements, but reminds the audience that this is his first hack at a big film.  Note: The CGI werewolf had me swearing and pounding everytime I saw it.  Carl: Whimsical, at times charming fellow.  Most would say he stole the show, but I will leave that for the werewolf.  The Brides: Sexy... gorgeous... vicious... well done.<br/><br/>If the viewer can get by the director's overdone CGI (save the werewolf, of course), and choppy scripting... then you have a good film.  Dracula and Van Helsing's backstories are not well thought out. The Monster was a little over the top.  The werewolf will blow your mind. I'd see it twice, thrice... (Note: Dracula-fanatic reviewing the film)<br/><br/>8/10."

"nastik09","5","1","2","6 May 2004"," Ok, so call me cheesy!
","But I liked the movie. Sommers returns after quite a long absence with a groundbreaking kind of a film. A perfect popcorn movie. A total 'you'll have fun seeing it!' flick. Of course not to forget that seeking any sense in this movie is totally useless, for you will not find it. What you will find though is a good shaken plot, with a wonderful WETA Digital special effects olive, in a perfectly clear Hollywood pre-summer blockbusters glass (still waiting for 'Troy' and 'The Day After Tomorrow'). So, what's it all about? Van Helsing, the man with a mission to kill the all existing evil, is sent to Romania to take on his greatest challenge ever - Count Dracula. What he doesn't know is that this task will be more than just challenging. I won't re-tell the story, though, you just got to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>
Having Hugh Jackman on board is a great plus to the movie. Despite the fact that he somehow reminds me of the good old Rick O'Connell of 'The Mummy'. But in a good way, not that he copies him, he feels like a relative. Jackman delivers his edgy side, familiar to the fans of X-Men (Wolverine is my favorite), but all the same with grace and razorblade sharp phrases along with the weapons. His assistant - the geeky-looking Carl, monch-to-be, played by David Wenham (LOTR fans - ye be warned, brace yourselves, no sign of noble Faramir there), is Van Helsing's sidekick, who's there to break the tension after every major action scene with a funny thing he says or does. Kate Beckinsale - the girl still has her rough skills from 'Underworld', where she also dealt with vampires, but was on their side.  Richard Roxburgh - the always pale, always hungry Count Dracula, who has an evil plan to destroy our world, which isn't news to any of the viewers.<br/><br/>
In short: the movie is packed with clichees, most of it is CGI, the story about the Dracula is nearly as old as the cinema itself and some moments are predictable for any fan of the genre. So why go and see it? Because the movie has its own charm, the typical Sommers touch. Because it made me feel like a child, such a fairytale-feeling it gave me. Because it fits action, romance and great plot twists along with the last battle, which I didn't see coming the way it did into the 2+ hours, which fly like the Brides of Dracula. So, relax, get yourself a bucket of popcorn, some Coke and let Van Helsing take you into his world of 1888, when good fought with evil in the name of God."

"jon.h.ochiai","7","1","2","10 May 2004"," So many monsters...
","I really did not know what to expect from Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" at least from the trailers. Was it going to be a light-hearted adventure, a classic tale of good versus evil, or just plain silly and entertaining? A key draw is Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, who is a great stage and screen actor, and this movie generation's classic leading man. Kate Beckinsale is a talented and versatile actress, who is stunningly beautiful. Well, ""Van Helsing"" is all of that, and possibly has the most monsters per capita, than any movie in recent memory. These are not exactly ""props"". Sommers' movie not only opens in black and white; it also dense packs Dr. Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster, and Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). And there are more monsters to come including, the Werewolf, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Fortunately, Director Sommers ends the movie well in the last 45 minutes or so, melding the story together after a very unfocused and chaotic start. Credit Jackman and Breckensale for keeping our attention amidst the chaos. They are very attractive actors, who also have a natural chemistry. ""Van Helsing"" ends up being a wild fun ride. <br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing about Van Helsing is Hugh Jackman. He has a commanding presence, a great voice, and is totally charismatic. It also seems that this younger vampire hunter Van Helsing, the nemesis of Dracula, has been reinvented for Jackman. He is similar to X-Men's Logan, who has a mysterious past and no memory of it. Also it seems that this Van Helsing is much like a James Bond for the Vatican-- James Bond may be the next role in Jackman's near future. Anyway, Van Helsing is off to Transylvania with cool weapons invented by sidekick Carl (the Vatican's ""Q"") to vanquish the evil Count Dracula. There they join forces with the warrior Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). The Valerious family has sworn vengeance on Dracula over the centuries. In an intriguing twist, it turns out that Dracula holds the key to Van Helsing's past. <br/><br/>Then the story becomes extremely convoluted. Jekyll and Hyde are thrown in for no reason. Dracula requires Frankenstein's monster to ensure his legacy. Van Helsing must stop Dracula before he himself is turned to a Werewolf. This really would give something away if the story were more coherent, but it is not. The special effects in Van Helsing are state-of-the-art; however, the writing is not. Sommers does recover at the end-- it ends satisfyingly. Apparently, Van Helsing has a presold sequel. Perhaps, that will be more story and character driven, and the role expanded deserving of Jackman's talents. Jackman is good here regardless. He plays Van Helsing as darkly heroic, romantic, and intense. He also displays a sense of humor. Kate Beckinsale is strong and charming as Van Helsing's partner and love interest. They are a great looking couple, and that does not hurt the movie. <br/><br/>""Van Helsing"" is silly fun, though it is frustrating to watch at times. It has enough star power from Jackman and Beckinsale, to engage and entertain for a couple of hours. A few less monsters and a cohesive story may have made a big difference."

And, it was pretty obvious that much like the ""mummy"" movies, that this one did not take it self too seriously (which doomed ""the matrix"" sequels).

"comedicactor2840","7","1","2","7 May 2004"," All In All, A Good Universal Monster Movie
","I saw Van Helsing this afternoon.  i thought it was very well done.<br/><br/>Without giving to much away, I'll tell you the basic plot. *Possible Spoilers Ahead*  The Vatican has sent their professional monster slayer Van Helsing to Transylvania to kill Dracula, so the Valerious family can finally find rest (For they have sworn not to enter heaven until Dracula is killed). There he meets Anna Valerious the last surviving member of the family (Due to her brother's encounter with one of Dracula's werewolves.).  They then team up, and learn that Dracula is searching for Frankenstein's monster, who is (and I won't reveal why) the key to bringing he and his three brides' children to life.<br/><br/>The complaints I've heard, so far, on these boards is that ""The monsters aren't like they were in the novels!"".  Well, get over it.  They aren't supposed to be.  Instead, Stephen Sommers (the writer/director of The Mummy) has opted for the Universal Studios versions of the monsters.  It seems that he was actually going for a ""re-envisioning"" (fancy term for remake) of two earlier Universal films ""The House of Dracula"" and ""The House of Frankenstein"", two of Universal's attempts at reviving their dwindling classic monster franchise.  Look at this version's Frankenstein. Physically, he looks like the Boris Karloff version, but mixed with some aspects from the novel, and Sommers' own interpretation.  The actor who plays Dracula even seems to be channeling Bela Lugousi (Which, in my opinion, is much more entertaining than Gary Oldman's take on the character.) This movie works much better than the earlier ""House of"" movies did, thanks to today's special effects.<br/><br/>My only complaint was a quick addition of Mr. Hyde, who doesn't work in this as well as he did in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (Which went with Literary films.) because they opted for the CGI effects, and he comes across (much as the Hulk did) as an evil version of Shrek.  Since it was going the ""Universal"" direction, they should have made him look like the earlier films.<br/><br/>All in all, though, this movie works in its own way.  Turn your mind off, and enjoy.<br/><br/>**** (Four stars out of Five Stars.)"

He is the Indiana Jones of the 19th century. This movie is about as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and far better than the other Indiana Jones movies. It is really great to see Dracula, Dr.Frankenstein, Frankenstein's monster, the Wolfman and Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde in one movie. It is like an edition of ""Leauge of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" with a special eye for horror. Maybe the action becomes a bit too much sometimes but the young Van Helsing is an action character as opposed to the older who is more scientifically minded.

"jdesando","Null","1","2","6 May 2004"," This film tries to entertain too many literary and film icons.
","Even `X-Men's' heroic Hugh Jackman can't save `Van Helsing' from sinking in computer graphics and lurid costumes as it assembles the great 30's a 40's monsters like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Wolf Man from the old Universal Pictures. Like `League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' this film tries to entertain too many literary and film icons so it ends up sliding over the surface of promising characterizations for the usual American overdose of special effects.<br/><br/>Jackman plays 19th-century Dr. Gabriel Van Helsing, who is to rid the world of these creatures, whereas he should be removing `The Mummy's' director Stephen Sommers' from any influence over dialogue for future horror flicks. When Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) says he tortures because `It's what I do,' the best line of the show is not more than an anachronistic cliché.  Some of the dialogue attempts a modern, casual irony better suited to `Die Hard' action than a hybrid of horror and comedy.<br/><br/>However, visually `Van Helsing' is impressive: The comely young women/bats in Dracula's harem wear form-fitting body suits that demand attention, fly with acrobatic aplomb, and show dentally dynamic incisors at the right transforming moments. Wolf Man is hugely menacing, powerful and realistic with dental work every bit as impressive as the ladies'. The waist of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) is corseted as small as those of the schoolgirls in `Picnic at Hanging Rock.' As for the embarrassing accents, neither she nor Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula should consider other work asking for anything but their native speech.<br/><br/>The film relies like many other American offerings too much on special effects; it seems every transition is loaded with action like the race with 2 six-horse coaches or Van Helsing shooting his rotary-magazine crossbow. The CGI power comes a bit, I suspect, from the dark frames, where more precise detail can be ignored and the background mattes overwhelm like dark drapes.<br/><br/>The best example of where this film goes wrong is with Frankenstein's monster, who turns out to be likeable in the way homely Shrek is. Although in `Prometheus' Percy Shelley described `Phantasms so foul through monster-teeming Hell,' Mary Shelley created her monster with affection. Like P.B. Shelley, James Whales scared the heck out of his audience with an ugly, pathetic, uncivilized hybrid. `Van Helsing' is more Mary than Percy and monstrously far from Whales."

","This is probably one of the most beautifully shot FX films in a long time, capturing the dark moody atmosphere of the early German impressionistic films, using some of the best background mattes seen in a long time. Unfortunately the skimpy story-line doesn't hold up for the long running time and audiences will start to get bored way before the end title. Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious are perfect in their roles. Richard Roxburgh has a wonderful time chewing-up all the scenery available as the campy Count Vladislaus Dracula and David Wenham brings comedy-relief to the side-kick part of Carl. Even though the ending will come as a surprise (and a disappointment) for most general audiences, anyhow this visually handsome film should do GREAT business in the boxoffice."

","After watching ""Van Helsing"" I must totally agree with Quentin Tarantino, who recently railed against the ever increasing use of CGI. Stephen Sommers´film is one big CGI-orgy! Plot? Logic? Coherence? Characters? Forget it!!! From the very beginning this film tries to clobber its viewers senselessly with one ""highlight"" after the other. As the film isn´t actually about anything except endlessly repeated vampire attacks, incomprehensible fights and chases, you don´t care what happens to the ""characters"";you just sit and stare with growing disbelief at the shoddy effects that don´t fool a five-year old. What was going on in the minds of the people who are responsible for this sorry mess of a film?!Why could Stephen Sommers not make up his mind about the kind of film he wanted to make; a horror film? A comedy? A rousing adventure flick? A touching and tragic love story? It simply doesn´t work to throw in as many of these ingredients as possible into the pot and hope that they somehow melt. Why did nobody raise a hand and utter some kind of objection during the conception and preparation? Do the people who spend huge amounts of money on a project like this really believe this is what today´s cinema goers want? In the end credits Stephen Sommers dedicates the film ""in loving memory"" to his father. What a strange relationship these two men must have had!!!"

"brando647","5","2","8","5 June 2012"," A Disappointing Monster Mash
","Writer/director Stephen Sommers rides the line between popcorn fun and mindless crap, and his 2004 ""homage"" to the classic Universal monsters of early cinema leans a little too close to the later. The premise of the movie is a sound one, and an idea I wouldn't have minded seeing land in the hands of a more capable director. Instead, VAN HELSING was one of the most regrettable summer films released that year and a waste of a potentially interesting new franchise. How this movie went on the gross $300 million boggles my mind, as it's nothing but throwaway entertainment in my opinion. There is no depth, no decent characters, and I don't think it does the classic Universal monsters any sort of justice. As over-the-top as it all is, I'd consider it closer to a parody. The movie follows Gabriel Van Helsing (a relation to the original Abraham, I suppose), a monster-hunter with a mysterious past that follows orders for the Vatican in disposing of the world's most evil creatures. He is sent on a mission to Transylvania with the aid of a cowardly friar to rid the land of its vampire menace, Count Vladislaus Dracula and his three brides. The princess daughter of an ancient gypsy lineage must destroy the creature if her family is to escape an eternity in Purgatory, but Dracula has his own plans. He hopes to use the life-giving technology of Dr. Frankenstein to bring his hundreds of offspring to life andthat's it, I guess.<br/><br/>There is a lot of wasted potential here, and it's a shame. Everything about this movie is below average, from the CG to the performances. This movie only really has one thing working in its favor: beautiful women. Unfortunately, eye candy isn't enough to build a good movie. It helps, sure, but you need more: excitement, a gripping story, strong characterssomething! Instead, VAN HELSING is forgettable at best. I watch the movie again every couple years because I see it sitting on the shelf and wonder if it's really as lame as I remember and the answer is always a resounding ""YES"". The CG effects are only slightly better than your average direct-to-cable SyFy movie. It stands out like a sore thumb and rips you out of the action, especially the cartoon vampire spawn. The dialogue in the movie is horrendous, with one of Dracula's brides (I don't remember which one, none of them were fleshed out enough to be distinguishable) even busting out with ""Too bad. So sad."" Seriously. That's the level of genius we're watching here. The story is lame and makes little to no sense. Since when do vampires procreate like living beings? And how effective is it from an evolutionary standpoint if Dracula needs Frankenstein's technology to bring them to life? Did anyone think this storyline through? The action in the movie is your usual tame PG-13 fare: bloodless violence and loads of rope-swinging. Nothing fantastic. Enough to distract you but hollow enough not to leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>No one in this movie seems to care. Hugh Jackman, fresh off his initial successes with the X- MEN franchise, is phoning it in. He spouts his one-liners and gives a half-hearted attempt at appearing mysterious, but you can tell he's not giving this role any effort. Kate Beckinsale is Anna, the last surviving member of the cursed gypsy family. She's hot and she's tough, and at least she seems like she's trying. The characters in the movie that get the short end of the stick in this movie are, again, the Universal monsters. Richard Roxburgh chews the scenery with over-acting that rivals Jeremy Irons in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. He is easily the worst depiction of Dracula I've ever seen, but not to be outdone as Shuler Hensley gives him a run for his money as Frankenstein's monster. I'm cool with Frankenstein's monster having the power of speech and an exceptional vocabulary (I've never read Shelley's original novel, but I believe it was an intelligent creature), but I'm not sure why he felt the need to literally yell the majority of his lines. No joke, he delivers most of his dialogue at the top of his lungs. And the Wolfman, well, he was underused as Dracula's unwilling henchman and a poorly realized CGI creation. The movie has a few redeeming qualities in its production design and the hope it inspires that it can't possibly be bad with such an awesome premise. Alas, if you're in the mood for a monster mash-up you're probably better off turning to the classics HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN or HOUSE OF Dracula."

","Van Helsing (2004) Starring: Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, David Wenham, Richard Roxburgh, Shuler Hensley, Elena Anaya, Will Kemp, Kevin J. O'Connor, Alun Armstrong, Silvia Colloca, Josie Maran, Tom Fisher, Samuel West, Robbie Coltrane, and Stephen Fisher Written & Directed By: Stephen Sommers Review ADVENTURE LIVES FOREVER Hello Kiddies your pal the Crypt-Critic here with a tale about a time long ago, a time called the 90s. During this mystical time a group of wonderful folks had the idea of remaking all the classic Universal movie Monsters. This Era brought us gems such as Bram Stokers Dracula directed by Francis Ford Coppola and two I haven't seen like Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and Wolf with Jack Nicholson. Now it was time for The Mummy to return but instead of making it horror, they turned it an action/adventure extravaganza directed by Stephen Sommers who went on to do the sequel. Both of which made money, it was only a matter of time until Universal would give him there monster properties. Stephen Sommers opted to do a franchise with all of the other monsters with the main focus being on the great and legendary monster hunter of them all VAN HELSING! Famed monster slayer Gabriel Van Helsing is dispatched to Transylvania to assist the last of the Valerious bloodline in defeating Count Dracula. Anna Valerious reveals that Dracula has formed an unholy alliance with Dr. Frankenstein's monster and is hell-bent on exacting a centuries- old curse on her family. This movie is a great big fantastical adventure from start to finish. The movie gives us great performances from Hugh Jackman as Gabriel, if they so happen to go with the original Van Helsing Abraham I think Hugh could pull that off as well if they give him the same great make-up from Logan. Kate Beckinsale is always a plus, if a movie's got Vampires, werewolves and Kate Beckinsale I'll see it because that is my biggest guilty pleasure. Richard Roxburgh is a pretty damn good Dracula, he has one scene that I really like where he's like ""No! I have no heart, I feel no love, no fear, no joy, no sorrow, I am hollow and I live forever."" The score for this movie is cool it gives off the movies epic adventure vibe. I'm pretty sure this film is inspiration for a new Van Helsing named Liesel Van Helsing, daughter of the original Abraham Van Helsing. They both have a similar attire. The direction from Stephen is great it's sad to know that isn't directing movies anymore if any he should be in charge of the dark universe. The special effects are terrible though, that I will not defend. But I had to much fun with this experience that it just didn't bother me. The wolf-man and designs of Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster also made it less bothersome , I loved the designs of the monsters. The werewolf transformation is also cool and very different from other werewolf films. Van Helsing is the kind of film you don't take seriously, you just grab some popcorn and go on a fantastical adventure with Hugh Jackaman and the sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy and did I mention sexy Kate Beckinsale. I'm giving Van Helsing a five out of five."

","The movie basically goes like this <br/><br/>(Hue Jackemen)Van Helsing goes and kills monsters/ legends and then goes to his next kill for instance in the beginning he kills some kind of creature and then he gets his next assignment.<br/><br/>The summery of the movie Van Helsing is in the world to rid all evil, even if not everyone agrees with him. The Vatican sends the monster hunter and his ally, Carl, to Transylvania. They have been sent to this land to stop the powerful Count Dracula. Whilst there they join forces with a Gypsy Princess called Anna Valerious, who is determined to end an ancient curse on her family by destroying the vampire. They just don't know how! <br/><br/>The moral of the movie is really simple the good always win no matter what. <br/><br/>I really didn't like the movie it was more for kids that where 7 and 13 year old kids it was very corny, there is one part in the movie where this bat lady flies up and is yelling at the little bats to kill the people or some thing like that. It was way to much drama it was like all the actors forgot how to act that or they just didn't know how to act it was embarrassing for me. The MPAA Rating is PG13<br/><br/>If you like corny movies and over dramatic movies then go see it if your a 30 year old don't even waist your time."
"jokerswild1","7","1","3","23 May 2015"," A childhood favorite that I still enjoy
","As is the norm with the films of Stephen Summers, the CGI is mostly lackluster, with Dracula's bat children being the worst example of the special effects. On the other hand, the production and costume design is very good, from the leather coats to the corsets. Gothic castles and scientific equipment are showcased throughout, with actual antiques being used in the opening.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is certainly a more stoic and serious lead hero than Rick O'Connell of Sommers' Mummy films, and Dracula is a much more talkative and performance-wise over the top villain than Imhotep. Hugh Jackman does a good job as Van Helsing, and his arsenal of cool gadgets don't hurt either. The worst characters are Dracula's brides, who are rather annoying and are given most of the worst lines in the film.<br/><br/>It's reminiscent of Castlevania, with a one-time-use objects that helps the heroes out and Dracula turning into a large demonic creature for the final battle. Sommers clearly likes the Universal horror films of the 30s and 40s, and rather than trying to do a film in that exact style and tone, he simply took various elements of them and adapted them into an action adventure film (as he did with The Mummy), and it works for the most part."

"gigan-92","7","1","3","26 June 2009"," A Must For Fans of Classic Monsters and Modern Audiences Alike
","Stephen Sommers once again takes a classic horror film refurbishes it into a modern action flick. I find it a very well made film actually. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale star in the lead roles and they both portray their characters excellently. Van Helsing had always been an interesting character to me, seeing as he's been in nearly every film Dracula has (besides ""Blade: Trinity""). I was wondering when they were finally going to make a movie of about him. Finally, the day came. Jackman is perfect for the role. Also starring is David Wenham, who provides a lot of the comic relief in the film. This film too me wouldn't be what it is without his comedic elements, seriously. The visual effects are incredible, especially with the werewolf transformation scenes, astonishingly real. The end fight between the Hugh Jackman Werewolf and Dracula is by far my favorite scene in the film. The CGI, lighting, and brutality of the fight all come together excellently here. The story was incredibly well done by my standards, including elements from several of the classic monster movies, even ""Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde"". The only one Sommers did leave out was ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"". At the same time don't expect a true classic like those films, but merely an action movie of Sommers material.<br/><br/>The action is adrenaline pumping and impressive, although the carriage scene is at times a bit over the top. The only other things that bug me is one, that ball room scene is never really explained. So were those all of Dracula's victims from over time, as I'm guessing, or what? Plus, how does one of those egg pod thing things even fit out of a bride's V-JJ, or in her womb as apparently, according to Frankenstein, they have several in one birthing. And they constantly hint to how Van Helsing got this amnesia, as if there is to be sequel or something, very distracting at times. Getting off those subjects, the music by Alan Silvestri is very well done and fits the film perfectly. The music at the climactic battle is one of the best pieces he's done in a while, especially as Van Helsing realizes the horror of the things he's done ( if you don't know what I'm talking about, see the film). Excellent SFX and action, but many a plot hole, ""Van Helsing"" is still quite the fun film."
"gnabeel","10","1","3","7 March 2009"," Best Vampire Movie I have seen.
","One of the best movie I have seen in vampire category. The CG effect is very cheesy. Its not like its just filled with computer graphics. There are many other elements as well. The acting was superb. There was a bit of balance between comedy, action and horror. There was not a single instant where I was bored or lost interest. It was all very superb. I wonder why everyone have given this movie a very small rating, just 5.5 ? I was very disappointed to see such low rating for this great movie. I recommended to my friends and they all loved it. This is the 4th time I have watched this movie, and I will watch it again. If Underworld can get a better rating, then why not this one? For what I have seen is that IMDb raters usually rate on fast movies with lot of action, and I hate slow movies."
"screenman","8","1","3","2 November 2008"," Hammer Never Did It Like This
","Not to be compared with the under-funded, frequently pretentious, but still enjoyable Peter Cushing sorties, 'Van Helsing' is a rip-snorting out-and-out swashbuckling, tribute to the whole Hammer horror genre.<br/><br/>The stuffy vampire-fighter of yore has been upstaged by an Indiana Jones character. Bookish, educated, but fundamentally a man of action.<br/><br/>And what action! The movie begins with him taking-down an extremely ogreish Quasimodo type (Mr Hyde) in a bell-tower. Later he is transferred to field-duty in vampire country, where he teams-up with a demented power-girl who has her own vengeful agenda against the powers of darkness.<br/><br/>Dracula has got a plan so cunning it would boil Baldrick's brain. And for this he requires a werewolf and Frankenstien's monster. So; with Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde we more or less have the lot. <br/><br/>Special-effects and CGI are absolutely mesmerising. The latter are, without any doubt, the best that I have seen, and go largely unsung in the movie as a whole. Likewise there are some wonderful set-pieces that give a whole new definition to 'gothic'. Van Helsing also has some wacky, James Bond-like gadgets such as a machine crossbow that shoots silver bolts.<br/><br/>Camera-work is excellent. Some of what appear to be micro-camera panning sequences merge with the astonishing CGI effects more seamlessly than those of the 'Rings' trilogy. It is, as they say, a roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is not a particularly commanding screen presence, but here he fills his boots at least adequately. Kate Beckinsale is likewise rather a lukewarm heroine tricked-up like an extra from the 'Rocky Horror Show'. They both have the rather blandly handsome looks of cyberspace avatars, as if they themselves were computer generated. Together they make the most of an exceedingly cheesy script.<br/><br/>Shuker Hensley gives the Frankenstien's monster genuine humanity (no irony intended), Mr Hyde lets Robbie Coltrane join the fun, whilst all are upstaged by Richard Roxburgh as the campily expansive Dracula.<br/><br/>This isn't serious stuff. It's not a corny morality tale. It's a joyously tongue-in-cheek romp through the whole horror genre that put wine and cheese on the tables at Hammer studios over so many years. But it's done with flair, style and just the right touches of shock and sentiment. If you can stay with the ride; for 2 hours it will absolutely enthral you."
"billpeter","2","1","3","23 October 2008"," Carry on Screaming without the jokes
","I've only seen this film described as a horror/thriller, but, after having watched it, I think that it was a parody/comedy gone horribly wrong. The main problem is the lack of jokes. It is even worse than Carry on Screaming, which did, at least, have the great Fenella Fielding. To see how it should be done just watch ""Young Frankenstein"" - the ""help me with the bags"" scene is a cinema classic. Even ""Dead and loving it"" was better, although Lysette Anthony kept her clothes on, and isn't as beautiful as Kate Beckinsale. For $160 million the producers could have done better, and made a decent horror, thriller or comedy, but failed at everything. In the words of Eurovision; ""null points"", but that's not allowed on IMDb."
"Prof-Hieronymos-Grost","2","1","3","29 September 2008"," A horrifying abomination
","Count Dracula is out to steal Dr Frankenstein's formula for reanimating living beings and also to take the key to this work, The Monster himself, his reason is to give life to thousands of Vampire babies he has spawned with his three wives, that are cocooned up in his Transylvaniaian cellar. Meanwhile across town Van Helsing is a masked crusader that fights evil and creatures of the night at the behest of a secret papal organisation. We meet up with him first as he tries to capture a demented Mr Hyde who is hiding out in Notre Dame cathedral, after disposing of his foe, he is sent on a mission to stop this Dracula character from completing his evil plans. Universal has a wonderful colourful history of Horror and creature films, here yet again Sommers, the man responsible for The Mummy films, continues to plunder their archives for the best of their characters and this time throws them all in to a Horror hotch potch of a film and hopes that they all gel..They don't!. Where can one begin? This film is a CGI abomination where nothing looks real, it's a bastardisation of wonderful childhood memories that I treasure, the characters are given new personas, for what reason I don't know? Other than to cash in on an already successful franchise, Sommers could have tried to bring new monsters to the screen, but instead he alters the very facets of the ones we love with an arrogant disregard. Van Helsing is now a James Bond like character, who has his very own team of experts who spend their days, making ridiculous contraptions and gadgets to help him rid the world of evil. Jackman sleepwalks though the film, Beckinsale looks hot but has little else to offer, Roxburgh hams it up aplenty as old Drac, but again fails to capture the character. For 0.99 I thought I had a bargain, despite its much heralded flaws, the fact is I was robbed of not only the paltry financial amount but more importantly 2 hours of my life."

I'm going to go buy it. It's funnier than most comedies. And there's so many games to play! Count the number of times Beckinsale is grabbed by the weird!flying!vampires. Count the times Beckinsale's bro falls in a river. Count the number of accent changes.

Clearly floor is not good enough for this cat. And as far as Ham of the Year Awards, this guy takes the cake. He's the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>I loved every nonsensical second of this movie.

"tmagd002","1","1","3","1 October 2007"," What was Hugh Jackman thinking???
","This movie is absolutely absurd. The plot is ridiculous and convoluted. It substitutes a legitimate storyline with copious amounts of CGI, poorly rendered CGI at that. Hugh Jackman was doing well with X-Men, and then someone slipped him some acid and he decided to do this movie. It's one of those films where the only possible way to justify it is to assume that the filmmakers were not taking the movie seriously, that they intended it to be a campy farce of the classic Gothic heroes/characters. And however much I try to tell myself this, I really think the producers made this movie with the utmost sincerity, which is just depressing. If you're a fan of Hugh Jackman, or even Kate Beckinsale, please, for the love of Dracula, stay away from ""Van Helsing""."
"When_Mantises_Attack","1","1","3","5 September 2007"," A tragic slaughter of an idea with immense potential
","This had the potential to be one of the best monster movies ever made. With the superlative Hugh Jackman on board as well as Kate Beckinsale - specifically and brilliantly proved in this genré in the vastly superior Underworld movies - matched to a good idea, a sound plot, and a healthy budget, Van Helsing should have been a shoe-in for the #1 slot for the best horror/action/adventure flick of our time. In particular, the creature designs were nothing short of spectacular. Van Helsing's werewolf is hands-down bar-none the best I have ever seen in a motion picture of any vintage or budget. The transformations, the vampiric and other monsters, and the motions thereof were also absolutely top-notch and were paired with smart cinematography to create an astounding visual treat.<br/><br/>Sadly, all of this was sent spiraling into the ground courtesy of the most atrocious dialog I can ever recall seeing on the big screen. It's an odd feeling covering one's eyes, shaking one's head and blushing with embarrassment over a movie that you had absolutely nothing to do with creating ... perhaps it was because a group of friends was there with me at my enthusiastic urging. How awful it is has to be heard to be believed, as I lack the poetic talent to describe it adequately. Add to this two-dimensional characters, very weak character development, and inability of those characters to connect with the audience, and what we are left with is a total failure of writing.<br/><br/>This movie proves that the script is key to a movie's performance. Even world-beating actors/actresses and world-beating special effects fall face-flat in the dirt when matched with weak characters and a script that sounded like it was written by a melodramatic tweeny-bopper girl just beginning her run of puberty.<br/><br/>As an especially avid werewolf fan, I am angry to this day that the best werewolf ever to grace the silver screen was wasted in what was perhaps the most mortifying letdown in the genré's history. As much as I champion the Underworld series, I'll be the first to admit that the Lycan design for those movies (barring William at least), while not horrible, did fall somewhat short of expectations. However, good cinematography, excellent use of lighting, and above all else, STRONG CHARACTERS AND SOLID DIALOG more than compensate for this. Had Underworld had Van Helsing's werewolves ... wow ...<br/><br/>So in conclusion, to all fans of this genré who have not yet seen this movie, two suggestions: One, either avoid this movie entirely, or Two, if you must watch it, do yourself a favor and hit 'Mute' immediately after hitting 'Play.'"
"BoyKing","1","1","3","7 June 2007"," Buffy Van Helsing, The Vampire Slayer (2004)
","I usually refrain from writing negative reviews, but in this case, I think that I'll make an exception. If I can save one person from renting or buying this film for his or her collection then I've done a very good thing. Let me begin by saying that I admire Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale as actors, so the problem is really not them in this movie, but rather how the movie is presented. First of all, I have a problem with the hero's name. I was certain that Dracula's nemesis was named Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, however in this movie version, his name is Gabriel. Secondly, Gabriel proceeds to use what appears to be modern day gadgets that one would find in the arsenal of Buffy Summers, if one were to look. If the setting of this story is supposedly sometime in the 19th Century, then why does ""Gabriel"" have these modern day ""Bat-toys?"" Thirdly, the script, what is up with all of those silly one-liners? And again, the characters are speaking in the modern vernacular, and not the eloquent, dignified speech of a 19th Century European settlement. These glaring discrepancies are what ruined this film for me. The silly one-liner jokes, modern day speech, and Bruce Wayne/Buffy Summer Vampire fighting gadgets cheapened the entire enterprise for me, and as a result, the film lacked authenticity. I did not like this movie."
"lodewijkpollemans","1","1","3","17 November 2006"," Worst 'monster'-movie ever
","I'm not gonna explain the plot of this movie, because that would be a waste of space, trust me. Everything about this movie is wrong. Hollywood just scrambled some nice and famous actors, spent millions, and I mean MILLIONS of dollars on CGI, and 0,000 in story/plot line and/or logic. The logic in this movie is so bad, that I think only a 4-year old could see through these horrid flaws. I.e.: Hugh Jackman wears a ring throughout the movie, but when he transforms into a werewolf later-on, he doesn't wear it anymore. ""Could've come of by the transformation into a werewolf"" I hear you say, but here comes the funny part; When he talks to Dracula himself later on and changes back into his human form, Dracula makes a comment about the ring on Hugh's hand that supposedly belongs to him. Ermmm... What happened here?! Did he put the ring back on in a split-second or what?? Thats just bad movie-making! Also, if you want to make a movie about monster-movie classics, make sure you got your facts right. The monster of Frankenstein wasn't called Frankenstein, only the doctor was called like that.<br/><br/>I have to admit that at least the idea behind the whole 'monster-classic'-ode of the movie sounds cool, but when it comes to it, this movie can't even get clóse to those classics.<br/><br/>The CGI-effects are also so wááááy to much on the foreground, that it made me feel like I was watching somebody play a (bad) video game on his PC. The werewolves look like furries on steroids, and act like gorrila's. Isn't a werewolf suppose to act wolvish, or at least something like that anyway? Now they jump over buildings like a furry version of the incredible Hulk. The barks-sounds that they made also were not very convinsing (wolves don't bark). Same thing goes for the vampires: just as terrible.<br/><br/>All in all; just rent some monster-classics and keep on dreaming of what this movie cóuld have been. This is a 'modern'-view of monsters that should not be."

Dracula was horrible. the sidekick dude was worse than jar-jar binks. frankenstein is an amateur existentialist after being alive for a few weeks. if you like this movie you are a sad sick person. this movie made me want to quit living. and by the way i did not see it on my own, my family and i have a tradition at Christmas time that we buy the worst movies we can think of that we have not seen and we sit around and make fun of them. its kind of like a mystery science theatre 3000. i knew this movie was bad but i had no idea it was this bad. i don't know how this is not on the top 100 worst movies because it is clearly worse than TRON or even BattleFieldEarth."

","""Van Helsing"" has excellent production design, music, sound editing, and special effects that should rattle the pre-teens it is aimed at and would probably have given me nightmares at that age but these days it's just rated PG-13.<br/><br/>Both Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman manage to do blue-screen acting within clunky costumes, but it's Richard Roxburgh's Count Dracula who really stands out as sexily sinister. One could certainly imagine his prolific fertility with his three model-pretty brides. Australia just keeps putting out these hunks who can do any accent.<br/><br/>The sidekick is the silliest yet for such movies; even the ones in ""Lara Croft"" are more interesting.<br/><br/>What a shame that Stephen Sommers wrote and directed as I just kept thinking what Joss Whedon would have done with the material instead of this literal and visual recycling of the old Frankenstein and Wolfman movies, etc., that were tired by the time Abbott and Costello satirized them.<br/><br/>What was that about Van Helsing having been at Masada? That must have been in the days when his name was Abraham, before this movie for no particular reason changed it to Gabriel. <br/><br/>(originally written 5/28/2004)"
"KSUFootball900","1","1","3","19 November 2005"," Horrible mockery to classic literature
","I was very pessimistic about van Helsing from the moment I heard about it, and I stayed away from it until it was shown at a Halloween party that I went to. I wish I had never seen it. It was worse than i could have imagined. I will start out with the things that are not quite what I'm mad about but still are just sad. The acting.....sucks. The plot.....sucks. Everything else...........really sucks. Although the scene that I hated the most was when they were at the ball and all of the guests were vampires....and o yeah that monk who was also miraculously an inventor....just happened to have his invention that he didn't know what it was until van Helsing was running away...then he found out it was freaking gigantic bomb! Completely retarded.<br/><br/>Now, why I really hate the movie. It is the most heinous assault on classic literature that I have ever witnessed. It took three of the best books ever written, Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Mysterious Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, it took these books and completely desecrated them.<br/><br/>We'll start with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll in Mr. Hyde form is a hunched deformed old man who is completely insane, he attacks people with his cane and fists and runs people over etc., In the movie Mr. Hyde in the movie is a gigantic pink muscle that swings around the rafters of some old church steeple.......completely disgusting. Oh yeah and when van Helsing kills him and he is falling and as he is falling....he turns into Dr. Jekyll! In the book he needs the special antidote to change himself back into his original state.<br/><br/>Now. Frankenstein. The movie the whole crap about him being electric and fleeing to the burning windmill with the village people after him. Every movie ever made about Frankenstein includes this. Frankenstein is all parts human no parts electricity or metal. He is a complete human sown together out of human parts they did not pump him with electricity, he just put him together and he was alive...not freaking electricity involved. No freaking burning windmill, or villagers. He was made in a laboratory at a college and the only one who knew of him was his maker, Frankenstein.<br/><br/>Last, and most brutally abused, Dracula, the best book ever. First let me start off with the main character. In the book van Helsing is an old man, a doctor who knows how to kill vampires. Not a renegade monster slayer. Second, this book defined vampires, it created them, and the movie sacrifices the vampires limits and restraints for the sake of the shallow adventure fan...no they are not all powerful. No they cannot spread their wings and fly. The only way a vampire can fly is by changing into a vulgar flying creature i.e. a bat. Third, what the heck is up with the automatic crossbow....no, they would not have it back then. Fourth, weapons equivalent to that of a predator are not needed and certainly not used ever in the book. You want to know how they really kill vampires? They ply open their coffins and get them with a stake, or put a wafer on them a communion wafer. No special weapons.<br/><br/>Well I could keep going forever about its flaws, but i will spare you. True book fans will not watch this movie."

","""Van Helsing"" never becomes what it wanted to be. I'm guessing that was supposed to be a mix of modern-age (kind of hip, if you will) and old-school (the look of the monsters) wrapped around two of the hottest Hollywood stars and a dash of a plot. Blah, you've seen practically everything this movie has to offer in other, better movies and after the LOTR trilogy this one looks pretty cheap. A budget of 160mill wasted on bad, over used and recycled special effects, ""Van Helsing"" thinks that CGI redeems all its other flaws. That theoretically might have been the case had these effects been better and used much much wiser that they actually are-by the gallon! There's so much of this that it gets tedious after the first half hour, and that's 2 hours more to go! <br/><br/>Absolutely nothing positive comes to my mind after seeing this crap (apart from the side-kick Carl, some genuinely sarcastic and funny moments and the actor playing Dracula-he looks like he's really enjoying himself and does impressive work with his script) The two main protagonists are not even worth mentioning, Hugh just does his job and Kate plays a stereotypical Romanian-accented woman.<br/><br/>Bad bad bad, I would enjoy it immensely bashing it some more but I have better things to do<br/><br/>Recommendations: a perfect movie for study breaks. A hardcore popcorn-movie you can see 15-20 minutes of every study break and know exactly where the story left-mainly because it doesn't go far;)<br/><br/>Peace<br/><br/>P.S. to big-shot Hollywood producers-stop making such CRAP!!!"

","I sat down to watch this film partly because IMDb users thought it's not as bad as the professional critics say. I generally find myself disagreeing with the professional critics but in this case I couldn't agree more. In the middle of the film it seemed like a torture to continue watching. There was no solid plot, the screenplay is as crampy as possible, the CGI effects were laughable and I don't know, this movie has the most annoying Count Dracula ever portrayed in film. Hugh Jackman portrays the lead character with some kind of ""Helsing... Van Helsing"" style with Bond-like gadgets (wow, he also has a Q). Kate Beckinsale fitted much better into a vampire role (Selena) than this vampire-killer stuff. In all, it was a very very disappointing film."

","I really do wish there was a zero in the drop down list! Giving this mess of a movie a one is far to generous.<br/><br/>I enjoyed both the mummy movies for what the were; action packed fun with a small plot that was enough to keep the movie going. However, Sommers latest 'homage' to the old monster movie classics is a mess that I don't think even Rubix could figure out.<br/><br/>Way over the top and corny acting from Roxburgh who plays Dracula, three screaming murderous vampire/harpy brides of Dracula who are just plain annoying and horrible cgi that is way over used is just the beginning in a long list of why this film is so bad.<br/><br/>Did anyone actually read the script before they began shooting or did they just make it up as they went along??? The one interesting plot twist, that Van Helsing is somehow connected to Dracula becoming a vampire 400 years before, is NEVER fully explained! I sincerely hope this does NOT mean a sequel is on its way.<br/><br/>Well, I could say more about the bad acting, lack of any real story, overuse of the great music to push the boring scenes along, etc... but I won't. Just suffice to say if you do see this film, make sure you are not expecting ANYTHING out of it. It really is that bad."

As a result, people, animals, and objects all behave in a manner that seems completely inconsistent with any known laws of physics (or at least my very rudimentary understanding of physics). For example, a person simply cannot fall from the heights that the people in Van Helsing do without either becoming severely injured or dying. It's not possible. Yet Van Helsing would have the viewer believe that a person can drop from the height of a two-story building over and over without so much as a scratch. I don't even remember anyone getting their hair messed up  unlike much of this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>I want to take this opportunity to apologize to the people who made Freddy vs. Jason.

","Whenever you buy a video for £2.50 from a supermarket bargain bin, you have to manage your expectations. The poor reviews of this wannabe blockbuster and franchise had already done that to a certain extent, but Hugh Jackman is usually good value as a leading man and Kate Beckinsale is one of the most attractive leading ladies of the current box office.<br/><br/>The first few lines of dialogue confirm that this film is a stinker. Clichéd without being amusing, this is an homage to nothing but bad film-making. Where The Mummy series romped, Sommers' offering stumbles like a newborn deer. With a silver stake through its torso.<br/><br/>So, let's look for another source of entertainment - focus on the visuals that all that money must have gone into. Sorry. Boooring CGI fill every scene. Never has so much mood lighting produced so little mood. Any chance of a consistent, believable (given the subject matter) plot? Nope. Van Helsing ranks alongside Troy as the most infamous butcher of source material in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>The final nail in the coffin? Kate Beckinsale wears a top for most of the film that makes it look like her breasts are bleeding. It must have been an ironic in-joke.<br/><br/>For £2.50 I could have bought some watercress and watched it grow. I'll know better for next time."
"jasonklingensmith","4","1","3","30 April 2005"," Suspend your disbelief!
","The only good things about this movie were the atmosphere, the special effects, and the woman that played Van Helsing's love interest.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed at several things this movie offered. While, I liked the way they incorporated more than just Dracula, the fact that the Werewolf was the only thing that could kill him, I didn't like. I also didn't like the way they used religion in the movie to describe Dracula and Van Helsing's roots.<br/><br/>The way the lighting changed rapidly, and after the sunlight was out, the Vampires were still attacking, was stupid. The character chosen to play Dracula was terrible, and he didn't do a very good job acting, either. I expect him to be at least somewhat intimidating. While I was in awe of some of the special effects, they really did hurt this movie. You already have to suspend your sense of disbelief for any monster movie or Dracula story, but you don't expect the normal characters to be more than human. Van Helsing's background was explained and therefore he can be the exception. But the woman, give me a break. She falls from trees, gets thrown out of windows, swings from wires hundreds of feet in the air, dangles from cliffs, yet somehow she manages to always land on her feet; not just on her feet, but on her feet without a scratch. It's very hard to take the movie seriously while this is going on. And then, after surviving all that, a werewolf landing on her, kills her. If she can survive all the other stuff, the werewolf wouldn't have killed her. The acting, aside from Dracula, was not really that bad. And the storyline wasn't terrible either, but in order to enjoy this movie, you have to suspend your disbelief of everything you've ever known or read, not just about monsters, but humanity as well. This could have been a great movie, but ended up being a waste of 2 hours."

Sure, I got a bit disappointed when Frankenstein was the ""Problem of the world""! That Frankenstein was important. I have always seen him as just a monster. Dracula was a cool character in this film. He was almost as I could imagine him. Almost! The Wolfman was scary the first time I saw him. Well, how would you imagine of a dangerous row of teeth would come against you in a rush? Anyway! I liked this film a lot, but I never would have guessed that Universal was ""responsible"" for it.

","Van helsing, noise, mediocre CGI, more noise, bad CGI, and yes more noise. Oh my! yes predictable lame summer blockbuster dialog didn't escape this 2004 blockbuster. Let me not be so harsh, there is some positive, Val helsing is a great looking DVD, perhaps one of the top five looking DVDs you will ever see. Got one of those LCD, HDTV TVs well this is a show piece of how good a modern movie can look on your new screen. As a movie Van helsing assumes you have seen movies about Dracula, Frankinstein, and Ware wolves, you won't learn anything new or to better put it there is nothing new. Van Helsing looks and feel like a video game, actors are set against the back drop of some beautiful computer graphics. One more positive production design is top notch. The lead characters Val helsing played by Huge Jackman and his co-op partner/player/actress Kate Beckinsale (see her in underworld recommended), they shoot, fight CGI monsters for over two hours, surrounded by a fairly decent musical score...more noise and CGI video game looking villains characters pop out of nowhere to keep our hero busy.<br/><br/>Jackman and Beckinsale play along, reciting dialog every so often while dogging/shooting flying things like in a video game, they solve puzzles like in a video game. Val helsing come down to "" opportunity cost "" Do you want to watch your favorite video game for two hours or play Resident evil 4, Castlevania or even Van helsing: the video game for two hours.<br/><br/>There are much better movies, books and games about Frankinstein and Dracula you can entertain yourself with, than viewing Van Helsing. But if you are into CGI, video games and state of the art home entertainment systems. Van Helsing will compliment your time but not your mind. 3/10 as a movie, 7/10 as a video game you are forced to watch for two hours and 9/10 as a DVD show piece. again opportunity cost."

","Overblown and a bit silly, but more than enough rousing CGI action to hold your interest. Scripted chaos with elementary cheesy dialogue. Let your eyes overrule your brain and VAN HELSING is a never-ending battle against the forces of evil. Fabled monster hunter Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman)is summoned to take on Frankenstein's Monster(Shuler Hensley)and a somewhat redefined Count Dracula(Richard Roxburgh). First he has to deal with Mr. Hyde(Robbie Coltrane)in a bell tower. Upon arriving in Transylvania he enters a love/hate relationship with Anna Valerious(Kate Beckinsale)and together they battle lovely swift-winged female vampires and deal with Anna's brother who has become a werewolf.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is of the horse drawn carriage winding and navigating snow covered Transylvania and jumping the destroyed bridge. I also liked watching Van Helsing blow holes in the voluptuous vampires with his gas powered spear gun. Also in the cast are: David Wenham, Elena Anaya, Kevin J. O'Connor and Will Kemp. Jackman seems to come off as a poor man's Indiana Jones.

It's a monster lovers dream come true as it contains Dracula, The Wolf Man, Frankenstein, his monster, Igor, and even Mr. Hyde as a bonus and Stephen Sommers gets very creative in combining these classic characters. Take the production design of Allan Cameron who designed films like Stariship Troopers and The Mummy. Then you have the cinematography of Allan Daviau who received Oscar nominations for his cinematography on Avalon, Bugsy, E.T., The Color Purple, and Empire of the Sun. Take those two combined with the imagination of Stephen Sommers, and you get a spectacular visual fest. The film isn't perfect.

","Taking a very, very dumb page from Sleepy Hollow (in which a famous textual schoolteacher was somehow changed into a cop), van Helsing the occasional vampire killer is now the full-time enforcement arm of the living against all things dead and evil, James Bond c.1889 if you will... If you stir in some of the moribund over-dramatics of Interview with a Vampire you get this frantic, loud, stupid movie.<br/><br/>Things are off to bad start with two unnecessary introductory sequences which eat up twenty minutes at the beginning that serve no purpose except to confirm for viewers that, yes this is the dumb fx movie you have been waiting for. The second of the two involves an absurd Shrek-like Mr Hyde. whom would scarcely fit into Edwardian London as a ten foot tall giant with acromegaly. If a sequel is made, presumably van Helsing will kill a nine-foot tall Lizzie Borden or Jack the Ripper with 4 arms.<br/><br/>The plot is one long bad joke. The beautiful princess Dexatrim (Kate Beckinsale) gets her brother killed and mayhem follows with all the Universal monsters except the Mummy. The euro-trash Dracula is grating and unsexy in everyway. He looks like a slightly uglier, more feminine k.d. Lang and unless you're a goth-nerd, his ponytail is about fifteen years late to offer even an ounce of hipness. The Frankenstein monster is excruciating. It's like he reimagined as a nerd/accountant. The ""romance-novel"" grade script requires that all the men have long hair. <br/><br/>This is best suited for sugar-impelled viewers for whom the current scene needs to be an overstimulating distraction because the last twenty weren't enough.<br/><br/>The last time this extravaganza was filmed it was called Hudson Hawk. This time it's more excessive. It's too long, too boring, too annoying, way too stupid and simply not enough fun. I know it's just escapism, but I have no need for any movie that makes my brain hurt as much as this.<br/><br/>Note: This decades film-work is being marred (and will be recalled historically as marred) by the tendency of fx film directors to ruin movies by shooting even simple no-fx-required shots with green-screen, because it's cheaper, easier, and they're lazy. Another film revolution will occur when Hollywood realizes when filming a simple shot of a guy with a torch in a field looks really amazing when you just shoot the damn guy in a field.<br/><br/>If you want to smirk while watching a piece of silly, campy crap, rent the grade-Z movie Frankenstein Unbound. ""Camp"" is when you have ten thousand bucks to make a movie and you let the movie have some fun by acknowleging that. It isn't spending millions on a loud, stupid movie because you lack taste.

","I remember when I first heard of this movie. It looked great because: 1. I thought Frankenstien's monster might be a bit scary. At least a BIT. - Wrong 2. I thought that Hollywood would finally steer away from those annoying vampire legends (sunlight, garlic, holy water...), and come up with something inventive and realistic - Wrong I have seen worse movies, true, but this was terrible. I've seen it a load of times, because I couldn't really say ""no"" to friends who had lowered it down to Van Helsing and The Day After Tomorrow (which was one of those ""worse movies"").<br/><br/>I agree with everyone's thoughts on Anna's accent; very annoying. I understand that she needed the accent because of where she was from (Transylvania), but the story, really, would have made more sense with more of a dark, travelling heroine. A woman who has been running from her hunters for many years, a woman who has seen he friends and family die in the snow, a woman who has escaped death by inches. We got a local.<br/><br/>Jackman, overall, did his job - he wasn't that bad. No overacting, a traditional angry character, and a decent accent. I should say that I didn't like the religious aspect of his personality (I won't spoil the movie, but once the truth about him was revealed to me, it blew the movie), but, I suppose, that's just a point of view.<br/><br/>I HATED the vampire women. The overacting they did made me wish for the movie to end quickly, because with all that screaming, crying and groping around Dracula, I just wanted to be sick with embarrassment. ""I spent nine bucks to hear a bunch of bad actresses scream their way through the auditions?"" Frankenstein's character was boring, period.<br/><br/>The movie followed that same pattern with the werewolf: Becomes human again; tries to tell heroine/hero the truth about himself/his master; then suddenly becomes a werewolf - very predictable.<br/><br/>With a very predictable storyline and unoriginal characters, this movie blew it. It had great potential, but just turned out to be another ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"".

Luckily we have stunt doubles that will prevent us from ever seeing Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman ever attempt to sink his long, lady like nails into Juggernaut. Even more fortunate, in Van Helsing, he just has to stand in front of a green screen and flail until he works up a sweat. In Van Helsing, the only stunt doubling he needs is in scenes where he's required to physically touch Kate Beckinsale.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with ""heros"" and ""villains"" that would totally be demolished by the wind up Nazi in Hellboy.

Or really anyone with oatmeal instead of a brain.<br/><br/>It does have plenty of action. A couple of the creatures are well-done. There are a few decent scenes, that is, scenes that show some creativity and actually have something like a plan behind their execution. Mostly, however, it's just one disconnected action scene after another.<br/><br/>There's no real story. Or maybe there is a story but it got put aside to focus on displaying the dark, damp and brooding-Gothic sets. It all looks like some teenager's heavy metal fantasy.<br/><br/>Overall it lacks any sense of drama. There's no pacing. The script is right out of a soap opera. The acting is pathetic. Beckinsale is about the same as she was in ""Underworld"" - dark clothes, long pauses with meaningful looks, and as much posturing as she can fit in.<br/><br/>Early on they walk into Dracula's castle - they see it off in the distance and walk through a woods. For the rest of the movie they work on unraveling a mystery involving a torn scroll, hidden passages, secret doors, passwords, a magic ring, etc. With much effort they unravel the mystery and are able to get into Dracula's castle - the same one they'd walked over to earlier.<br/><br/>Most of the characters look and sound alike with heavy middle-European accents. Except Jackman, who delivers his lines with modern sarcasm.<br/><br/>David Wenham does a nice job. As does Robbie Coltrane - although it's only his voice. Richard Roxburgh is a fair Dracula.<br/><br/>The movie steals from numerous other movies: Jackman has several Batman tools; he works for a secret organization and has a Q designing gadgets for him; refs to earlier Dracula-Werewolf movies are all over.<br/><br/>Frankenstein is in it of course.

","I think this movie was very under rated by most critics.<br/><br/>Most of this unfair criticism was due to the amount of over hyped publicity before the film's release.<br/><br/>The plot line had enough deviations from the original Dracula/Werewolf/Frankenstien movies and was a really nice mixture that added depth to the character development process. <br/><br/>Even after several viewings of the movie I still see things that were missed in previous viewings.<br/><br/>The casting was very good and Hugh Jackman fans will really enjoy how he takes this character to it's extreme edge. <br/><br/>The special effects were well planned and only in a few spots did I think they could have used live action more effectively.<br/><br/>The use of black and white cinematography in the beginning was actually a very nice technique.<br/><br/>The costuming was appropriate for the time period yet stylish enough to tie it to the modern era.<br/><br/>The comic relief was well placed and the friar being similar to Q from the bond films was very entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good movie for people that have very limited exposure to the horror film genres."

","Easily one of the worst movies that I have recently seen. Good effects, but every movie has good effects nowadays. Terrible plot, terrible acting/script, and it was SO long. This one ranks with the ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" as one of the biggest bombs I have seen. There was not much plot development and the story seemed to jump a bit. However, when good met bad, the scenes took FOREVER. It seemed like Dracula just kept getting away and the movie kept going. Dracula seemed to be a bit too campy and Frankenstein was one of the wimpiest/most sensitive monsters I have ever witnessed. If this was Hugh Jackman's chance to make it as a leading actor, then he certainly picked the wrong film!"

","Van Helsing enlists a Transylvanian beauty to battle Dracula. Complicating things are the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster. This ""summer blockbuster"" looks more like a prototype for a thrill ride than a movie. It features some of the worst dialogue I have ever had the displeasure of hearing. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale have proved in ""X-Men"" and ""Underworld"" that they can carry action films but they both fail miserably here. I'm not typically against CGI, but I felt like I was watching a cartoon! I did like that Dracula's Brides had a large role in this, and as CGI flying vampires, they were somewhat creepy. This would have been more exciting as a 3-D attraction at Universal Studios or an arcade game. My Rating: 3/10"

","I learned early on in my enjoyment of Stephen Sommers' work that it is not to be taken seriously, but that you were to sit back and enjoy the ride. I did this with ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" and certainly had a great time (The less said about ""The Scorpion King"" the better).<br/><br/>""Van Helsing"", however, is an entirely different story. OK, I went into this not taking it seriously, but this film was beyond ridiculous at times. I am dying to know where the witty and energetic dialog of ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" went. Except on the odd occasion, I can't find it in this script. Also, there are events in the film that seem totally implausible. (Such as - how could Frankenstein's monster have such an adult depth of understanding about the world and about who he is so quickly after his creation)<br/><br/>Besides that the actors in this movie sometimes ham it up to the max. Roxburgh in particular in his portrayal of Dracula was so over the top at some points that I wanted to smack him. There was also something about him that did not register quite as the sexy vampire that can lure women to their doom. Maybe it was that strange nose of his that kept drawing my attention in every scene he was in.<br/><br/>I would like to tell you that there was some great special effects in this film. There usually are in a Stephen Sommers film, but I couldn't see them given the fact that the screen was so dark half the time. There was very little color or light in this film, and it only added to my general feeling of dislike.<br/><br/>Mr. Sommers, I could tell by the ending that you were thinking ""sequel"" in your brain. May I suggest that you try a new idea instead."
"baba44713","Null","1","3","1 December 2004"," A much bigger mess than expected
","(Some SPOILERS follow, so beware)<br/><br/>When you go to see a movie where one rugged hero battles against Frankenstein (ok, Frankenstein's monster), Dracula and the Werewolf, you don't exactly expect the plot to be on par with ""Citizen Kane"". You think sure, there must be a story that somehow ties all this creatures together, it probably won't be believable (if that word is even allowed to appear in a ""Van Helsing"" comment), but it should be fun and exciting.<br/><br/>Exciting? Maybe, if you're into fast and loud. Fun? Unfortunately, not so much.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers is known to me as the director the original ""Mummy"". That movie was great. It had Indiana Jones-style wit, it had amusing characters, a nice rounded story and after seeing it I felt good and refreshed. It was a brainless movie, but an extremely fun brainless movie.<br/><br/>Enter ""Mummy returns"". Same actors, same director, a totally different movie. All the characters suddenly went super-hero, humour became forced, and the entire movie was basically a big collection of back-to-back action scenes. For me it became extremely tiresome half-way through, and I remember barely succeeding in watching it in entirety.<br/><br/>I hoped so much that ""Van Helsing"" would go the way of ""Mummy"" and not ""Mummy returns"". Fat chance. Whatever was wrong in ""Mummy 2"" is wrong here. Sommers doesn't care for the story much. I didn't expect much of a story, but I expeced A story. This movie gives you a feeling that the scriptwriting phase was one big brainstorming event where 10 people gave their ideas as they came up, and in the end they just copied the entire blackboard and wrote ""Van Helsing - the movie script"" on top. <br/><br/>You really have to work at shutting your brain off while watching this flick, cos there are so many wild inconsistencies and contradictions it's actually impressive. Small example: only a werewolf can kill a Dracula (naturally). Only Dracula has werewolf cure. Why? Because it's his counterweapon against the only thing that can kill him. But the kicker is that the cure doesn't actually work against werewolves, but against a werewolf to-be. This makes Dracula having it completely pointless, but also enables a dramatic finale. Oops, I started thinking again. Terminate brain function. Whoa, cool action scene. Look Beavis, that Beckinsale chick is hot. Yeah. Huh-huh huh-huh.<br/><br/>There is some humour in this movie, but it's way downplayed. Good self-aware humour and character could have saved this movie, the way Johnny Depp went Pirates of the Caribbean or Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead 2, but Sommers discarded it in favour of non-stop action. The few jokes that are present are unfortunately too weak and too far and between to work. And they mostly come from the generic clumsy comic-relief sidekick, which is as tired cliché as they come.<br/><br/>Bottom side is - if you want loud and fast, and enjoy CGI fests, and think that plot is just a nuisance that ruins good action in movies, you will probably enjoy this flick. Hugh Jackman fits the role perfectly and has some semi-funny lines that almost work, Kate Beckinsale is certainly easy on the eyes and the rest of the crew is mostly on-par (Dracula could use more character though). The sequel is almost guaranteed, cos there is some unsolved mystery concerning the main character (although I can't believe anybody actually cares for that)."

Great use of horror classics to create an amazing adventure film. I'm glad the script was strong on it's own so the visual effects alone did not overwhelm the storytelling. The effects are incredible throughout the film. It seems as though the entire cast enjoyed film production as it shows in their characters and interaction. Hugh Jackman is the perfect lead for this film. The filmmakers should definitely put Van Helsing in for some film nominations! This is another success for Stephen Sommers!

","Vatican hit-man, Gabriel Van Helsing, must deal with Dracula, the Wolfman, the Frankenstein monster, and don't forget Mr. Hyde, in this overblown adventure film. Unlike a number of horror fans, I don't hate this movie. I don't even think it is a bad horror movie because I don't consider it to be a horror movie at all. It bares more resemblance to an Indiana Jones adventure than any of the original Universal films featuring these classic monsters. Wait a minute. Come to think of it, when I was watching this film, I wasn't thinking about Indiana Jones. I was thinking about Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap and his guitar amp that went to eleven. Stephen Sommers, true to his everything-but-the-kitchen-sink school of film-making, felt the need to turn everything in this film up to eleven too. He thought he could earn the love of the audience if he concocted the biggest and loudest film of all time. Not so. Did Mr. Hyde have to be a giant? Frederic March was much scarier and more interesting as a normal sized man! And why would Dr. Frankenstein make a monster and forget to attach the skull flaps so that the brain wouldn't be exposed periodically? Would Dracula's brides give birth to bats in cocoons? And the political correctness I don't think representatives of all religions would be working together under the Vatican to destroy evil. And, please, why couldn't Dracula's brides have nipples? No wonder not of their children lived! In retrospect, it is amazing how much the filmmakers of 1930's managed to accomplish with only a fraction of the tools at Sommers' disposal. In fact, the best thing about 'Van Helsing' is that it inspired Universal to release many of its classic horror films in thoughtful and relatively inexpensive box sets. Thanks for that, Stephen!"

"benne666","2","1","3","24 October 2004"," Werewolves, vampires and lots of monsters.... Yep it's a B-movie
","First of all, I don't write many reviews. I only do the best movies...or the worst, So give me a break, it is just my point of view.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing, a badass dude who travels around the globe to kill everything that has to do with evil. He has been sent to transylvania to kill Dracula that has been tormenting the country for centuries. Of course, things become complicated when he has to handle werewolves and a 500 pound Frankenstein. <br/><br/>Owkay, this movie IS the badest movie of 2004. There is nothing good to say about Van Helsing. Bad sfx, lousy acting, and a plot that even the biggest moron would figure out. <br/><br/>When you hear that Stephen Sommers is the director you always have to be very careful. We know that he likes to make popcorn movies like the mummy 1 and 2 and deep rising. So after the ridiculous mummy returns you should have been warned. Van Helsing is like a bad roller-coaster trip that lasts for two hours and when you finally get off you have the feeling that you wanna throw up. <br/><br/>As for the special effects? My god, they are absolutely horrible. When Dracula's brides fly off, or when a man turns into a werewolf or even Mr. Hyde, you feel that there is something missing. They actually spend 160 million dollars and they didn't have decent sfx. What a waste.<br/><br/>And how about the acting? Well there is not much to say about that either. It's completely rubbish and you will never believe that Kate Beckinsale is a roemanian (xcuse me for the spelling) gipsie. ""He is the firrrrst one to kill a vampirrre overrr a hunderrred yearrr, I say let's buy him a drrrink"". Yeah, Swallow that! As for Richard Roxburgh and Hugh Jackman...Guys what were you thinking? Conversations turn to the worst and the one-liners are really laughable.<br/><br/>So now, you know. This is crap. Do not buy this movie, do not even rent this movie, do not watch it while you're drunk or stoned. Forget it, it will only be a waste of money. <br/><br/>My star rating: 1 out of 5 <br/><br/>p.s.

They managed to combine many different horror stories, and yet make them all work. It was sort of like an Abbot and Costello flick, but it still pulled it off. <br/><br/>The graphics were very nice as well, but the thing I enjoyed the most was that the werewolves actually looked like wolves! They weren't giant gorillas like they are in most horror movies, they were giant wolves.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say this was an amazing movie, but it was definitely a fun movie, and well worth the 8 bucks to get in."
"Doylenf","Null","1","3","30 May 2004"," Entertaining, a bit over-the-top with its graphic horror, but still fun...
","My main reason for seeing this old-fashioned fright film done in high style with elaborate sets and excellent actors, was to see Hugh Jackman on the big screen after having watched him in OKLAHOMA! on PBS in a wonderful televised version of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical.<br/><br/>He makes a convincing Van Helsing and dominates many of his scenes with authority and skill--but I think we have to wait for a better scripted part to really judge his screen acting. He and all the other cast members are entirely up to the proceedings and there can be no complaints about the casting.<br/><br/>In addition to excitement, there is abundant humor (of the somewhat corny kind) to add some spice to the relentless scenes of Dracula's wives having a grand old time scaring the hell out of everyone in sight. Perhaps for this reason I found it uncomfortable to watch young parents sitting in the audience with toddlers on their laps, letting them absorb all of the graphic fright scenes with a casual air, as though the film was ideal entertainment for three year-olds. Whatever happened to Disney?<br/><br/>Most impressive are the elaborate sets, all providing the chilling atmosphere needed to bring this sort of thing off. It's worth noting that the first fifteen minutes are done in B&W fashion, harking back to the days of the Universal horror flicks with Karloff and Lugosi. And for some reason, when the film is over, it's the opening B&W sequences that chill with the most power.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's score is heavy on the orchestrations but quite stunning as an accompaniment, lending grandeur to the elaborately staged action scenes. An enjoyable romp, if a bit repetitious after awhile."

You don't go into this looking for realism, a coherant plot or the most adult sensiblities. You get Wolverine doing a Solomon Kane routine, Kate Beckinsdale in a bodice with a sword, 3 models cackling in harpy get-ups ala the Wicked Witch of the West, a fun wise cracking side-kick(Farimir from Lord of the Rings!), decent Wolfman and Frankenstein fights, f/x, etc.<br/><br/> They will definitely make a couple more of these, I hope next time they rein in the camp factor somewhat.

","This movie is painful to watch. Why didn't some one stop director Stephen Sommers and his directorial excess is beyond me. I like The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, I even like Deep Rising, which this resembles in its desire to top itself at every turn.<br/><br/>Van Helsing, a thousands year old man who works with the Vatican is sent off to fight Dracula, his brides, werewolves and the Frankenstein monster. Its everything to excess as the filmmakers rub your nose in everything that they've stolen by referring to every damned film they've ever seen.<br/><br/>
Its awful.<br/><br/>The opening sequence in black and white is meant to be a throw back to the Universal horror films of the 1930's and 40's, it comes off as if a bad jokey TV commercial. The next sequence of Van Helsing in Paris with Mr Hyde is clever and works, except that its a rip off of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in the design of Hyde. At this point, with Van Helsing returning to the Vatican the film falls into an abyss of rip off mania, the worst being the Q like monk. You know Q from James Bond?<br/><br/>From here its off to Dracula and its over blown over done sequence after sequence as more and more and more crap is thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>Sommers has said that this is a film that he would have made when he was nine. Well did he have to regress himself and allow that nine year old to actually do so? Then again I can't see any nine year old actually liking this...<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, except for Igor's make up (which would have been bad twenty years ago) the effects and the technical film making and some of the script (not all) are okay, granted the effects can  shift from good to laughable but mostly they are okay. The problem is that the film doesn't have any sense holding it together. There is no sense of anything other than more is less.<br/><br/>More is less is also true of the acting. With the sole exception of Hugh Jackman everyone over plays it.<br/><br/>I spent most of this movie physically pained, batter by the over done nature of it and the fact that all I could help but think was ""this should have been better"" over and over again.<br/><br/>You don't need to give your money to the producers on this one. Only doing so will think we want a sequel and that would be a very bad thing. Stay home and begin a stamp collection, its a much more rewarding way to spend two hours."

Dracula, who funded Frankenstein, figures that his investment has borne fruit, and kills the doctor. The monster is enraged by this, and manages to escape Dracula and the mob with their torches. Dracula recruits Igor.<br/><br/>(2) Van Helsing confronts Mr. Hyde in Paris at the behest of a secret group operating out of the Vatican. In doing such work, Van Helsing has become a wanted criminal of international renown. He has no public support whatsoever, and is hated by many.<br/><br/>(3) At the Vatican, Van Helsing is dressed down by Cardinal Jinette. He gets a new assignment: to protect the Valerian family (Anna and Velkan), and to help them kill Count Dracula in a fulfillment of a family oath. The oath was that the family would not enter Heaven until Dracula was destroyed. Van Helsing meets the friar named Carl, who is both timid and talented.<br/><br/>(4) Velkan and Anna attempt to trap the werewolf that has been terrorising the village. Velkan kills the werewolf, but is bitten in the process.<br/><br/>Delineation of conflicts: Velkan becomes a rather powerful werewolf. Dracula would use Velkan for his own purposes. Van Helsing and Anna have a chewy first meeting, then agree to oppose Dracula's intentions toward Velkan.<br/><br/>Dracula and his trio of mates (Aleera, Verona, and Marishka) want their undead offspring to have life. Van Helsing, Anna, and the Vatican want them to die: Van Helsing, to follow orders; Anna, to save her family from Purgatory; the Vatican, to drive the spawn of Satan from the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>Frankenstein's monster would like to live in peace with some degree of freedom. Dracula wants to consume him to transfer life to his offspring. The Vatican wants the monster dead since he's not precisely human, and his life was not given to him by God. Carl would like to comply with the Vatican's wishes, but cannot in good conscience.<br/><br/>Dracula wants Van Helsing dead for strong reasons of his own.

","The greatest monster hunter of them all has his work cut out for him as he tracks down three deadly foes in this action-adventure saga. Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man who has dedicated his life to battling evil forces who exist outside the bounds of nature; Van Helsing's work has not always made him friends, and a false accusation of murder still trails him. But when he's summoned to Transylvania at the behest of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), whose family has been fighting supernatural beings for generations, Van Helsing wastes no time answering her call. There, Van Helsing discovers that the undying vampire Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) has put a misshapen creature named Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) under his spell, and, in turn, has forged an alliance with a hideous monster (Shuler Hensley) who was created by the misguided Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West). Adding to Anna's burden is her brother, Velkan (Will Kemp), a lycanthrope who becomes a bloodthirsty wolf under the light of the full moon. Van Helsing also co- stars Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca, and Josie Maran as Dracula's vampire brides. ~ (Mark Deming, Rovi) While the film has some impressive action scenes, some good cgi, and good pacing, what ultimately brings the film down is the nonexistent plot, terrible dialogue, terrible acting, and no real sense of fun and a lack of real thrills.

Featuring Count Dracula, Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, Igor, The Wolfman and of course Van Helsing, all of the film's characters have already been seen a hundred times before. This also means that the plot has been seen a hundred times before. And even its most original character is a clichéd damsel in distress who is somehow good at fighting as well.<br/><br/>In this film, Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula. Jackman, although usually very good, is at best, average here. His accent is a mix of Australian, English, American and Eastern European (considering his character is Dutch) and he doesn't show much emotion which leads the viewer really not caring what happens to him.. The action is well held up by a suspenseful score by Alan Silvestri but somehow still manages to be predictable and boring. Only in the end, when there is something to fight for, does the action start to feel fun and inspired. The transition from scene to scene is poor and that is down to some awful sound editing. The film's lighting is also dreadful, so much so that in some of the night scenes you can't actually see half the action. Stephen Sommers dialogue is pretty laughable and makes Kate Beckinsale's acting seem much worse than it is. Richard Roxburgh plays the Count very well but it's just a shame that he is surrounded by a CGI and effects overload. I was also very surprised that 'Van Helsing' was given a 12 certificate by the BBFC. There are some moments of genuine horror and some scenes are extremely (to put it mildly), gooey. The ending is also very soppy but surprisingly unhollywood. Not for anyone under ten, 'Van Helsing' is another remake/retelling/reboot that has failed."

If the movie had been tongue-in-cheek (e.g. ""The Night Stalker"" or ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things""), it might possibly have succeeded.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe, with the time-tested material they had to work with, that they could possibly have failed to make an entertaining movie.

Then, nothing...it never came out, which left me wondering.<br/><br/>Well, now that it's here and I've had a chance to watch it, I can honestly say I'm neither here nor there on it. I can't bring myself to dislike it, because the CGI and elements (c'mon..Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. all in one movie? How cool is THAT!) do make it fun to sit with.<br/><br/>However, I'm NOT sold on Ms. Beckinsale's performance...honestly, while very attractive indeed, she just wasn't doing it for me in this movie. The chemistry between her and Jackman seemed, well...a bit ""off."" Maybe it was the fierce independence of both characters. I don't know.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me was the fact that the CGI does tend to get a little out of hand...such as the jumping from wall to wall, etc. It works great on monster morphs and such, but there are times where you're just going to shake your head at the overkill.<br/><br/>Overall, not a waste of time. Any fan of the genre will enjoy watching this movie at least once. Jackman does a good job throughout, and you do find yourself liking him. 5 out of 10 stars."

If you like a mixture of humor and action, with spectacular photography and a rich score, this is for you. While The Mummy is okay, Van Helsing is far more original and well-done in every aspect - a camp action masterpiece. Much better than 90 percent of the movies I have seen in the last decade."

","Van Helsing (2004) <br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Monster hunter Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) goes to Transylvania where he plans to sit on his couch and play video games. Wait, scratch that. Monster hunter Van Helsing heads off to Transylvania to destroy Count Dracula, the werewolf, Frankenstein's monster and a bunch of flying CGI vampire women. VAN HELSING is a really bad film. I'm not even going to try and compare it to Universal's Golden Age of monsters and I don't think anyone else should either. We're living in a different age so anyone going into this film expecting to see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi were just bound for a disappointment. What's so maddening about this film is that apparently the director is a fan of monsters and yet he delivers a really bad, really boring mess that has no energy or life. Sometimes I think filmmakers just decide to throw loud noises at a viewer and hope they won't notice that nothing is going on. I'm always shocked when certain blockbusters become hits and no one seems to notice that you've got two-plus hours of pure boredom hidden as some sort of action film. The CGI monsters are just downright ugly. The CGI buildings are downright ugly. In fact, every bit of CGI here is downright ugly and look so incredibly fake that you can't ever believe anything you're seeing. The performances really aren't much better with Jackman basically sleepwalking in his role but I guess we really can't blame him since the majority of the time he was just looking at a blue screen. There's really no energy or life to be found in the film as director Stephen Sommers has the film all over the place. His story is just downright overkill and it's silly to think that with this expanded running time you could watch two films from the Golden Age of these monsters."

","Cheese Incarnate, ""gone bad"" describes Van Helsing to a tee. It's loud, it's full of explosions and cartoonish special effects, silly lines (especially from The Brides of Dracula), goofy humor, and Saturday morning villains. And this would be fine. Sommers did the exact same things with both of The Mummy films, and I was pleased as peach about it. Unfortunately that's not what Sommers did with Van Helsing. Sommers attempted to make a movie that was dark along with action-packed. And unfortunately, to make something dark it has to have two things: atmosphere to match and drama. I wasn't feeling the atmosphere, and the drama pushed the film past camp into irritation. To put it simply, the film was overacted in its attempt to be dark. There was one scene in particular where Dracula was having an argument (or conversation; I really couldn't tell the implied mood of the scene) with his wives, and I had no idea what was going on. There wasn't a point to the conversation, as it merely hopped from one subject to another, and it didn't help move the plot along at all. The scene was overacted in some vague attempt to stick feelings in a film otherwise devoid of it, and several other scenes mimicked this same type of structure (especially at the end). There was theme in there about not reading a book by it's cover (or something to that effect: it wasn't really hashed out until the last 30 minutes of the film), but by the end your just fed up with the overdrive into hokey mock-drama that you really don't care. If Van Helsing could have kept the pace and feeling it had in the first battle with Mr. Hyde, then it would've been fine. It didn't. Van Helsing reached to high, and never even got within arm length of it's goals."

","Tom Cruise is going to be the new Van Helsing and some of the IMDb's users are so frustrated that they talk about this movie with nostalgia.<br/><br/>OK, even if Tom is hated (mostly in USA) it's impossible that any movie with him inside could be half of bad that Sommer's Van Helsing is.<br/><br/>Van Helsing, Stoker's vampire hunter and, in overall, a mighty character. The promise of the appearance of the greatest cinema monsters of all-times. A solvent director like Stephen Sommers after having directed ""The Mummy"" and its sequel. Great cast with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale at the top of their careers and an astronomical budget. This movie had everything to become a big success, but the result was one of the worst movies I have ever watched in a cinema.<br/><br/>I'm a soft reviewer. For me, it's very hard to give something lesser than 5 out 10 to a movie, because I enjoy so much the cinema that is near impossible to get me so disappointed to consider a movie a fail. At least with last 15 years's movies. It's very hard to find a masterpiece but it's also true that it's hard to watch a really bad movie. Furthermore, and to be honest, if the movie has a low Budget or my expectations are not too high my critical capability is inferior than when I'm watching a hyped blockbuster like this. <br/><br/>The movie fails in everything. Bad story, worse script, childish dialogs... those are things that can be ignored in a fantasy movie like this and it would have been a great movie even with those flaws. But, I repeat, this movie lacks everything. Visuals are pathetic for a 160 million giant. Cgis are horrible, and action scenes are poor. DrÃ¡cula is everything but frightening, Notre Damme's hunchback is ridiculous and Frankestein... Frankestein gave me the best moments of the movie because is absolutely laughable. <br/><br/>With this, it should be enough to consider this film a big fail, but I would give it a 5 out 10 if it wasn't for the ending. The ending is directly the worst and the most ridiculous ending I can remember in a movie. Please note I'm talking about first class, Hollywood made cinema, OK? Crap like ""troll 2"" or ""Aliens vs Avatars"" are another, disgusting, thing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is one of the ten worst mainstream movies I can remember, tied with ""Green Lantern""."

The addition of Carl as comedic relief was a bit unnecessary. If anything I would have like his character more if he were more intelligent and scientific. Also the ways that certain characters met their end didn't really make sense due to what they walked away from previously.

","Hugh Jackman spends his time running around, dodging sword slashes and vampire bites in slow motion, jumping over broken bridges and jumping from death-defying heights with his trench cloak rippling in the wind behind him. They turned Van Helsing into a character that fights like Neo from ""The Matrix"", but has no personality whatsoever. They reduce great literary villains and characters to poorly choreographed fifteen-minute action set pieces that take place in horribly busy, overcrowded frames. The characters never do anything remarkably interesting as far as how they fight either. Van Helsing is pretty much the Vatican's monster hunter version of James Bond; he's got ridiculous gadgets and weapons, but he never does anything cool with them. Instead, Jackman hits a monster and the monster hits back, over and over again until one of them dies. There's no tension, there are rarely any stakes established- the dialogue in between the action scene is heavily expositional and often incredibly stilted. Every scene just feels like an excuse to move us to the next action sequence; there's no thought into why things look the way they do, other than if something looks cool.

","When I saw this in the theater back in 2004 it struck me as a singularly awful cinematic experience. The story was filled with far too many plotlines and a jumbled mess of characters. The film's visuals were overwrought and filled with some shockingly bad CGI work. The acting was pitched, hammy and annoying. The film made weird allusions to the bible and the references to the Universal Horror films of the 30's and 40's felt more forced than loving. Simply put I hated the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, I re-watched the film the other day for the first time in *years.* A lot of that is still true. No one will confuse this film for great cinema. It isn't even, necessarily, great popcorn fun. But time has really helped the film a lot. The CGI looks, technically, far worse today than it did in 2004; given the sheer amount of CGI present the film ends up with theatrical aura of artifice. This works to the film's advantage as it shifts the tone into camp. This immediately makes a lot of the overstuffed story and pitched acting *enjoyable* as loving cheesy homage to the original set of Universal films. Moreover, the fake looking CGI feels appropriately dated the way the black and white and pseudo-German expressionism feels dated in, for example, Frankenstein (1931). Time has made the film feel far more like an extension of, say, The House of Frankenstein than a cynical cash grab banking on the success of the Mummy movies.<br/><br/>The opening sequence still stands out as the best in the film. It is *exactly* what a homage to the big 3 monsters should be. I am glad that Summers had the wisdom (or backbone) to at least film that in black and white. (The film would be far better if it embraced being camp). If only the rest of the film was as well thought out I wouldn't had to wait 15 years to get a fairly fun movie."

The film opens with Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) creating his monster, but with Count Vladislaus Dracula (Moulin Rouge's Richard Roxburgh), you understand why they were working together later, but of course Frankenstein and his monster (Shuler Hensley) are burned by the outside mob, while Dracula escapes. Years later (stil the 19th Century by the way) we go to the great Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), a famed monster hunter trying to catch Dr. Jekyll, or rather Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane), and failing. But anyway, the real story comes about when he is given a mission to protect the last two members of the Valerious family in Transylvania. When he and his friar sidekick Carl (The Lord of the Rings' David Wenham) gets there, Van Helsing at first is questionable, especially by Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale, putting on quite a sexy Transylvanian accent), but he proves his worth when some vampires start attacking. As the plot develops we find out that Dracula is planning a mass attack on the town for all the blood they lust, by hatching some eggs full of deadly bat-type creatures. To do this though, the need an electrical charge that can only come from either lightning, or with the help of Frankenstein's monster, who is still living. As it continues, Anna's brother Velkan (Will Kemp) is turned into a werewolf, Dracula is defeated almost really easily, Van Helsing's werewolf is stopped, but he failed to complete his mission, i.e. Anna dies. Also starring Elena Anaya as Aleera, The Mummy's Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor, The Mummy Returns' Alun Armstrong as Cardinal Jinette, Silvia Colloca as Verona, Josie Maran as Marishka and Tom Fisher as Top Hat. The special effects are good, the dialogue is really cheesy, the acting isn't much better, it is just lame, and only worth watching at least once. Okay!"

","An incredible amount of special effects, a silly and implausible plot and far too advanced for the time weapons, could I be talking about anything other than a Stephen Sommers' film? Probably not.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, with Victor Frankenstein yelling 'It's alive' taking us back to 1931 and to a young Colin Clive, Van Helsing is a tribute to the legendary Universal monster movies. Everybody's here: Frankenstein, the wolf man, the character of which despite its totally different look still reminds us of the renowned Lon Chaney Jr, Count Dracula in a very anti-Lugosi (or Chris Lee for that matter) look which if my memory doesn't fail me includes an ear ring! Finally there's the famous hunchback called Ygor (surely one of Lugosi's finest performances e.g. Son of Frankenstein, 1939) <br/><br/>Unfortunately this homage to horror classics will go by unnoticed by anybody too young or too ignorant to be familiar with monster movies, and he/she will therefore perceive this movie as another mindless action adventure. This is partly true in terms of the plot: Dracula's women giving birth to dead babies and him trying to bring them back to life using Frankenstein-like techniques. Parallel to this is the werewolf legend and the search for a lycanthropy cure. Both the plot and collection of monsters serve as an homage to movies like Frankenstein meets the wolf man (1943), House of Frankenstein (1944), and House of Dracula (1945). The count appears in the two houses, whereas the wolf man (Larry Talbot) is in all three seeking a cure or an effective way to kill himself.<br/><br/>This movie transforms Bram Stoker's Van Helsing into a monster hunter or exterminator whose assignment just happens to be Dracula and who suffers from nightmares that apparently are repressed memories of his previous existence. Anyway plot-wise it's no Pulitzer prize winner, I grant you that, but don't miss the point, It's a tribute to an era long gone. After viewing many Universal classic horror originals and sequels I couldn't help but like the film. Probably the greatest way to enjoy it is by first watching the original Dracula, Frankestein and Wolfman movies which will enable you to put the film into perspective or in an appropriate context within which to judge it. <br/><br/>To conclude Van Helsing is not (at least in my opinion) your mainstream action adventure, it's a well made fantasy ride that owes its plot and characters to a number of extremely influential horror classics."

","Famous monster hunter, Van Helsing,(Hugh Jackman) is called to monster territory in Transylvania which involves him with the forces of darkness and death. There is plenty of sparks with special effects and even Frankenstein appears along with the Wolf man and plenty of Draculas killing their prey. Richard Roxburgh, (Count Vladishaus Dracula) gives an outstanding performance as the main blood sucker along with Shuler Hensley, (Frankenstein Monster). Kate Beckinsale, (Anna Velerious) adds some female attraction along with a great cast of blood sucking monsters. This is a horror films which will keep you glued to your seats. Enjoy."

","I saw this film in the cinemas with some Buddy's as we thought vampires and werewolves? what can be better? <br/><br/>impaling ones eyes with a pitchfork thats what. <br/><br/>On to the review. The film is just a mish mash of all horror movies of old and to a lacklustre effect,i wouldn't say the acting is awful but there wasn't any breakthrough performances and I'm sure the script didn't help much. Kate Beckinsales accent wasn't that bad but i believe the writers/director/producers only wanted her in this movie as eye candy which is wrong Kate deserves a lot more than that. Her character also seems to be invulnerable to all forms of pain and can Fall through tree branches from 30-40 feet and get slammed into walls without consequence. Then it looks like she forgot her cheat codes as she was killed by bring pushed onto a ....sofa..? wait wait wait hold up was her character allergic to velvet or something? i found this pretty ridiculous. Hugh Jackman comes in with the stereotyped cheesy one liner action hero which is what has been the norm for summer blockbusters to be honest. CGI has been a main gripe with some people I'm with Spielberg's FORMER conclusion of the less you see the better as too much cgi takes away from the connections with the characters. That along with the lack of character development really does pull this movie down. <br/><br/>Watch this film if your in the mood for a cheesy popcorn flick but otherwise give it a miss."

","Van Helsing (2004, Dir. Stephen Sommers) <br/><br/>Van Helsing is in the world to rid all evil, even if not everyone agrees with him. The Vatican send the monster hunter and his ally, Carl to Transylvania. They have been sent to this land to stop the powerful Count Dracula. Whilst, here they join forces with a Gypsy Princess called Anna Valerious, who is determined to end an ancient curse on her family, by destroying the vampire. They just don't know how! <br/><br/>If you really enjoy classic horror movies, such as 'Dracula' or 'The Wolf Man', then you should enjoy this, as it's sort of a combined homage to them all. It's not just horror movies which get the homage treatment as their are obvious references to the 'James Bond' series. It's not the best of movies, but it is great fun, with some amazing special effects and a wonderful score to go alongside it. Hugh Jackman was the perfect pick for the character of Van Helsing, and you can really see that he enjoying his character. It's not too childish and not too scary, so it's a perfect horror movie which can be watched with the family.<br/><br/>""Some people say your a holy man, others say your a murderer. Which is it?"" - Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) <br/><br/>""It's a bit of both."" - Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman)"

","I love this movie. At first glance all the plot holes and cheesy dialog are enough to make the purists run screaming into the night; but then you realize it is INTENTIONAL. Could they have made it uber-slick, uber-deep, and a character study to boot? Yeah, they could have. But it would have eliminated the point.<br/><br/>The one-liners and escapism are in fact the point. Sometimes all the drama gets to be too much, a little campy humor is more than appreciated. Devotees of the Rocky Horror Picture Show might get a kick out of this. I am, and I did. It practically screams for similar treatment, it's that kind of a movie. I find myself saying lines along with the characters, and talking back to the screen a TERRIBLE amount, but if you can suspend your disbelief, that's FUN! No, it's not a serious look at Dracula. It was never meant to be."

","I have to agree with the first poster here.. the film's beginning just caught me and reeled me in for the rest of the film.. I was really interested in seeing this film when it came out for many reasons.. 1)another spin on Dracula;2) Hugh Jackman and 3) I was just about to move to the Czech Republic, where most of the film was shot.<br/><br/>I live there now and am watching the film on TV, dubbed, sadly but it's what lead to this comment.. the film does offer up some fun references to other films - and as mentioned gives us one of the best Frankenstein's monsters since Clancy Brown in the horrible ""The Bride"".<br/><br/>I have to say the only thing I really didn't like about this film was the werewolves.. way to much CGI -- I really haven't seen a werewolf that I liked in recent films.<br/><br/>Hugh's character looks like Vampire Hunter D, the really wonderful Anime vampire hunter, so that's a nice touch.<br/><br/>For doubters of the quality of this film.. it's worth taking a look. It's anachronistic, a bit over the top, but good fun and some good performances.. Much like Sommer's Mummy films."

","Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is an infamous monster hunter, Who works for the Vatican. Helsing and his sidekick Karl (David Wenham) are sent to Transylvania on a mission to destroy Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his three brides (Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran). But Count Dracula isn't working alone, since he has the Wolf Man (Will Kemp) on his side and his loyal assistant Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) are planning something of unspeakable evil, which could help Dracula be the ruler of the world. But Dracula's needs the Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to make his evil plan work. Because the Frankenstein's monster has plenty of energy, power and life on his body. Helsing isn't alone, since he also finds help from an tough female warrior Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). Which Anna tries to save her brother, which her brother has become an Wolf Man. Van Helsing and his sidekick finds themselves in the most difficult mission of their career. Especially they are the only ones, who could destroy Count Dracula and his three evil brides with the help of Anna.<br/><br/>Written and Directed by Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Deep Rising) made an enjoyable if especially dumb action-packed ride. Jackson is solid as usual as the title lead character in the film. This movie has good supporting performances and some fine visual effects. Although Sommers' script is some ways could have been much more and less jokey in tone. Which it worked much better in his previous pictures. The movie's best moments are in the first half of the movie. It does offers something different in some key sequences. It will also probably disappointed some of the die-hard fans of the Universal's monster films. But this movie is aimed more at kids and fans of Sommers' movies than the general audiences.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two enjoyable commentaries tracks. One is by the writer/producer/director:Sommers and editor/producer:Bob Ducsay. Second commentary is by the actors:Roxburgh, Kemp and Hensley. DVD also has featurettes, Outtakes and more. But the best thing about ""Van Helsing"" is the funny, campy performance of Roxburgh is certainly an Hoot as Count Dracula. The actresses, who plays his three brides have their moments as well. Beckinsale is somewhat in familiar territory after seeing her in the ""Underworld"" movies. Sommers' movies is always been style over substance with heavy CGI effects, good looking cinematography and strong music score are always important in his films. Probably the most memorable thing in the movie as well is in the Black & White opening sequence is terrific as well. I thought ""Van Helsing"" would have looked great if the whole movie stayed in Black & White. Since this film was even an bigger hit on DVD than it was in theaters. Fred Dekker's ""The Monster Squad"" was done much better and it was ahead of it's time as well. Overall ""Van Helsing"" is entertaining, Sommers' best film is still ""The Mummy"" and he should lay off the monsters movies for a while. (*** ½/*****)."

","Alright, so, the guy that played Igor in this movie, Kevin J. O'Connor, also played Benny in The Mummy. In The Mummy Rick (Brendan Fraser) throws a chair at him and a hilarious interrogation ensues. In Van Helsing, Van Helsing throws one of his discs at him and the exact same thing happens. Of course they were both directed by Stephen Sommers, I just thought it was hilarious how he had the exact same actor do the exact same thing in two similar but different movies.<br/><br/>They're both great movies, and like that one guy said, it doesn't matter if a movie is spot-on about everything unless it's entertaining and fun to watch and Van Helsing is definitely one of my favorites despite the fact that silver doesn't kill vampires, I'm not sure where they got the idea in the Blade movies, I'm glad they did it properly in Underworld.<br/><br/>And another thing I noticed, it was interesting how after doing Underworld, a movie with vampires and werewolves Kate Beckinsale ended up doing a movie with similar content right after Underworld in Van Helsing. Will Kate and Kevin never escape their fates?"

","Okay, I'll admit I am a Hugh Jackman fan till the end, but I really don't see what's bad about this. Sure, it lacked a few things, but it's better than sitting and watching a remake of Dracula. I mean come on, you get the Wolfman too! There isn't a better movie than having the Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein. Then you'v got great actors and a good director, Hugh Jackman who's Wolverine from X-Men, Kate Beckinsale from The Underworld Series, David Wenham who's really popular in Australia, Shuler Hensley who's a great guy on Broadway, and a whole a lot of other people who were able to put this together. So I'll give it a 10 because it's got the actors, it's got a director, and the only flaw was that it's storyline could be better."

The villains that Van Helsing fights in this movie are, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Count Dracula, Frankenstein Monster, Dracula's Three Brides, and some Werewolves. So much action. Too they didn't make as much as they had anticipated. It had a huge budget of $160 million and it made domestically about $120 million. It was very entertaining. It had great action scenes. I especially loved the fight scene in the woods with Dracula's brides and the werewolf. I know I a one of the few. Of course, I am only 13. But I know I liked it."

","I thought Van Helsing was an excellent film, good story line, laid out perfectly and that was the best incarnation of Dracula. However the film could have lost one thing, the idea of Van Helsing. And The ""left hand of god"" however the film was greatly done. Sommers is a great director, for films like the mummy and the mummy returns. Those films, are a classic. And So is Van Helsing, i don't understand why people don't like the film. Why are people into ""gore"", its just boring to see that, its better with action/horror. Great visual effects. Perfectly done. I give the film 9/10 stars. The films introduction to Dracula was a great masterpiece and very well done, it certainly beats the other Dracula's along with their ""come and soon you well become a creature of the night!"""

","I often watch this movie when I need a picker-up. It's just one of those movies that, no matter how hard you try, you cannot manage to take seriously. Whether you're a fan of action, adventure or romance, this movie creates a monster of each genre. It's what directors create when they have too much budget and not enough plot and it's why people say Hollywood is going to the dogs (wolfmen).<br/><br/>Action-wise, most of it is computer animated. And it's not half-bad, but that means it's only really half-good. It's just computerized enough that you can tell it's computerized. Any action that's not computerized... Well, I obviously don't remember it, so...<br/><br/>Adventure films assume a sound plot, which Van Helsing cannot seem to deliver. It's like they took every single legendary monster they could find and shoved them all into one movie. My friends and I check often for guest appearances of The Mummy, but we guessed that the director already got that out of his system. Basically, the plot can't hold up against any critic and most of the time, like when you find out about wolfmen, the movie just leaves you with a 'huh?' and not plausible explanation. <br/><br/>The romance is forced, without much lead-up. Basically, you know it's coming, because you know it HAS to be coming. The main characters hook up because they HAVE to hook up. It's just that kind of movie. And although the chemistry isn't awful, IE, they don't physically repel each other, it's not great, either. <br/><br/>The only point that this movie really sources is comedy, and not for the non-wise-cracking sidekick, either. (My friends and I were so disappointed after realizing that the typical sidekick wasn't even funny. THAT was the worst part). The true comic genius goes unappreciated, though, as, in the Simpson and countless other spoofs, there is a Mufasa reference. Okay, it's not a reference, but heck, it should be. <br/><br/>So there it is. This movie is funny if you like bad movies, but go into it assuming it's a true action/adventure and you'll be sorely disappointed. I love this movie, and suggest you watch it for a laugh, which is sad because I do love Hugh Jackson. Hopefully, he has better things on his horizon that souped-up monster movies."
"bystander-2","9","0","1","4 July 2007"," beyond the genre
","Yes, this movie is a mess, lot of cgi, mix up of characters from vintage horror b-movies, restless action but not so thrilling... but this is just because the audience this film calls for is not really the target of what the story is about. In this screenplay I found a very interesting and original tale of good versus evil, full of subtle and deep insights. The presence of the Vatican is particularly important in this sense: the Catholic Church has investigated evil more than any other religion, for some reasons I can't reach. I would say it is a kinda religious movie. I would pair it to ""Stigmata"", another not flawless story about a very important religious issue, mistaken for just another horror/fantasy movie. While waiting for the masterpiece, I greatly appreciate that these movies tackle some important and neglected religious issues... even if this happens beyond authors' intentions."

I know why people consider it to be a horror film, but I really think it was more of an action film. The only part that startled me was the time that on of Dracula's children popped out of the cocoon, so the visual effects were real to me.

","I just viewed Van Helsing for about the 3rd time before I reluctantly had to admit - this was not all that AT ALL! The plot (if one can call it that) was so contrived one immediately wonders ""why am I watching this again?"" Oh yeah...for ol' luscious Hugh!!!! To be sure the special effects are dazzling. But this was the real problem with The Mummy Returns. After salivating over the Rock and hoping that Brandon would reveal a little flesh, the movie descended into one big special effect. This rather trite and boring strategy, an obvious (and unsuccessful) attempt to cover up plot holes, was alas, prevalent here as well.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, this would have been infinitely more bearable if Hugh had shown a little more flesh. After all these special effects slash changes, you'd think they'd have given the wardrobe mistress a free hand to work out a lil' sump'n sump'n a tad more titillating to show off Hugh so we can forget that this picture was just not the one.

After this the deploy of the movie kept me amazed, of how an incredible film can manage all these terrifying monsters and still being a great film!: (1) Dr. Jekyll/Mr Hyde, (2) The Wolfman, (3) Frankestein (4) Dracula (5,6 and 7) The Vampire Brides (8) Igor, etc etc. The heroes are just like comic book heroes, but excellent; Van Helsing as the left hand of God and protected by church is just a great new era of the Crusades. Excellent! <br/><br/>ABOUT THE FILM: Hugh Jackman plays here Van Helsig, a Vatican detective, not very popular, who served to God finding and destroying the worst evil in the world, he followed instructions from The Vatican, and his skills were afraid by all the monsters. After he fought against Mr. Hyde, he was put on a special mission in order to destroy the evil Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), he then goes with his assistant Carl (David Wenham) to Transilvania and meet the Valerious family, who where trying to kill the monster 400 years ago, the only female survival was Anna Valerious (Kate Backinsale) who joined Van Helsing in his mission. They faced a great threat trying to kill this monster in which get involve also powerful fiery Wolfmen, Frankestein monster, more vampires (including terrible brides of Dracula), huge castles and more.<br/><br/>For this incredible ride i give 9 out of 10, great work of Stephen Sommers! !"

","Van Helsing is a Universal Horror picture, made some fifty years after the Universal Horror era. It stars actors Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham, and it was directed by Stephen Sommers.<br/><br/>The movie begins inside an original Universal Horror picture, Frankenstein. Shot in black white, and staring Sam West as Doctor Victor Frankenstein, who, when in costume, looks surprisingly alike Colin Clive, who played Doctor Frankenstein in the original Frankenstein movie. After having seen West yell ""It's Alive!"" several times, seen Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein Monster wake up, and seen the townsfolk charge up to Frankensteins laboratory with pitchforks, flames and battle rams, we are stunned by Richard Roxburgh's performance as Count Dracula, showing us an amazing, and very different interpretation on Dracula, than we have seen in the past. In the first scene, we see some great visual effects, (it appears to be the same Computer Generated Images as used for the cursed pirates in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".) Strangely enough, there are no credits, not even a title card, but we do get to see Van Helsings name on a wanted poster in this next scene of the movie. Van Helsing is in Paris, hunting 'Mr Edward Hyde', voiced by the fabulous, Robbie Coltraine, a cannibalistic, Computer Generated character who appears to be at least eight foot tall, separating itself from the Metro Goldwyn Mayer movies (Universal never made a Doctor Jeckyll and Mr Hyde movie as a part of their horror genre), in which Mr Hyde was a short, crippled man. When returning from an action packed fight with Mr Hyde, to a secret society consisting of all the known religions in the world, Van Helsing is given his next assignment, he must go to Transylvania, and kill Count Dracula, before Count Dracula kills the Valerious family, who, if are killed before Dracula is killed, will never enter the gates of heaven.<br/><br/>Having established where we stand in this world, and that men can drink potions and become hideous beasts, men can create life via robbing body parts of others, and that vampires exist, we now get to see one of Universals most loved monsters... The Wolf Man. The wolf doesn't charge around on all fours all the time, as the Werewolf does in 'An American Werewolf in London', yet it doesn't always walk around on two legs like the wolf does in films such as 'The Wolf Man' and 'Werewolf of London'. It is a mixture of both. They run and charge at their prey on all fours, yet when they walk they walk around on their hind legs, like a human. The wolves seem to be huge in size, and the speed they run at suggests that no human can outrun them even with a head start.<br/><br/>These are not the only characters included in this film from the classics, Igor from Frankenstein, makes a good B villain, and much more characters are included as the story progresses.<br/><br/>Alan Slyvestri, the composer of the memorable and powerful music of the Back to the Future films, doesn't let us down, and provides a once-again powerful musical score, with a score you would expect to find in modern movies, and at the same time, gives us music you would find in the Universal Horror Classics.<br/><br/>The film displays some excellent acting talents, especially those of Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxburgh. Also, I might add, the visual effects in the film are definitely Industrial Light and Magic, displaying 'their' true talents. They are undoubtedly, the best of the best, when it comes to CGI. Stephen Sommers also shows us some great writing talents and some fantastic shots.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of my all time favorite films. Anyone who enjoys a good Universal Horror picture, should watch this."

","Van Helsing starts in 'Transylvania 1887' where Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) succeeds in bring his creation (Shuler Hensley) to life, however the evil Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) wants it & the secret of Frankenstein's experiments to help him give life to his young... Jump forward 'One Year Later' to 'Vatican City Rome' where Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong) orders monster killer Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) to Transylvania to destroy Count Dracula, Van Helsing has little choice. Once there Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) who is also trying to kill Count Dracula, they team up together to achieve this goal but they quickly discover it's not as easy as they had hoped...<br/><br/>This American Czech Republic co-production was written, co-produced & directed by Stephen Sommers & I have to say I have now seen Van Helsing twice & enjoyed it immensely both times. The script is set in a fictional Victorian world which lots of familiar monsters & character's inhabit & it has them all meet up, in this sense it's very similar to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) although I think Van Helsing is a better film. Anyway, the film moves along like an absolute rocket, you can't take your eyes off it for a second or you'll miss a fight, a monster, a great set, a ridiculously extravagant set-piece or just Kate Beckinsale in that super sexy outfit complete with ultra tight corset & thigh boots. The entire film is littered with references to other classic horror/action films, in fact I'd say maybe it relies too much on paying homage & not quite enough time on being original but when a films this much fun I'll cut it some slack. The character's are not that well developed but since most will already be familiar with them who cares? On a negative side perhaps the pace is too fast, no-one ever seems to stop to catch a breathe & as a result as I've mentioned the character's & plot are given little to develop & suffer plus there is some truly awful dialogue that at times is quite embarrassing & then there's the fact it lasts for over 2 hours, on a personal level I dislike films which are too long & I'd have preferred Van Helsing to be a bit shorter although I can't think of anything I'd like to see less of. Overall though I thought it was a cracker & provides terrific non-stop entertainment as long as your not after something serious or deep, which I'm not because for me films are ALL about entertainment, it's as simple & straight forward as that.<br/><br/>Director Sommers does OK, having said that he seems intent on bombarding us with non stop CGI special effects, fights, action set-pieces & monsters, while for the most part they're spectacular it does get a bit repetitive after a solid two hours of the stuff. To be honest in a weird way I feel like I'm criticising a Lottery win because I won too much money, strange eh? With so much overblown CGI on show there's no subtlety in Van Helsing at all, forget about much suspense or any of the scares which the original films Van Helsing was based on were all about. To keep the rating down the violence in Van Helsing isn't explicit & forget about any blood as it's not that sort of horror film.<br/><br/>With a mind boggling supposed budget of about $160,000,000 (!) Van Helsing looks brilliant, everything is so extravagant, the special effects are top-notch, the set-pieces are as big as they come & the whole thing looks fabulous with some cool sets from the Transylvanian village to the interior (& exterior for that matter) of Count Dracula's Gothic castle to Dr. Frankenstein's lab & I love the story in the IMDb's 'Trivia' section for Van Helsing which claims that the lab was equipped with antique medical equipment purchased on eBay! The acting isn't up to much but then did you expect it to be? You know I really do think it was a great decision to cast Beckinsale who is a real hot looking bird & have her kicking the hell out of people in that outfit, good work all round I reckon. Roxburgh complete with earrings makes for a slightly campy but still quite cool Dracula.<br/><br/>Van Helsing isn't for everyone that's for sure, the purists & those looking for something a little quieter & a bit more serious should avoid it. Those looking for top big budget mindless entertainment to pass a couple of hours, don't mind the odd lapse in logic & like hot women in tight corsets & thigh boots then Van Helsing could very well be the film for you.

","it would have been pretty good if the script was decent, but there you go. the only real reason 1 would watch it again is because Kate Beckinsale in that corset outfit looks SO DAM HOTT!!!! GAWD she also wears a red dress at some point so look out for it...DAM she looks fine in that....some of the vampire girls aren't bad either. Anyhow back to the film, set in Transylvania this dark looking film is about the time when Van Helsing (the vampire hunter) is a swarthy young guy instead of the stereotyped old doctor as seen in most Dracula films, basically he's been told by the church to hunt down Dracula and kill him once and for all, after meeting the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale (who plays Anna valerious)they go trampling around Transylvania trying to find Dracula and kill him, bumping into Frankenstein's monster and the wolf man on the way.....on the whole the film is OK, special effects are pretty cool but script sucked a bit hence only 6/10 from me!"
"inkblot11","6","0","1","21 December 2006"," Part horror, part hoot....stunning visual effects and a slyly comic performance by Jackman
","Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a monster hunter who achieves results, through luck and weaponry. When he is sent to take down, once and for all, the evil Count Dracula, it is an all out war with the denizens of the count's castle, including Frankenstein, werewolves, and vampires by the dozens. Only Anna (Kate Beckingsale), a young noblewoman whose brother was changed into a vampire by Dracula, is on Helsing's side. How in the world will the two of the them win out? Part horror, part hoot, this movie is a fun watch for an evening. Jackman is just right as the monster hunter with the sardonic wit of a stand-up comic. Beckinsale is a more serious but worthy supporting cast member. The film is visually stunning, even in an age of computer generating effects. Just watch a lady vampire swoop down and scoop up prey or a werewolf change in the moonlight. Younger children should probably not watch the film, for it has scary images. But, teens and adults will hardly be afraid for long, as Jackman cuts everyone down to size with his words. Recommended for a something-out-of-the-norm movie for a night without a full moon."
"nvmoviefan","5","0","1","13 December 2006"," An okay movie
","I don't consider Van Helsing as a wonderful movie, but it's not very horrible either. Some parts of it are entertaining to watch but you take a nap or daydream about something else during the other scenes. The problems I have with the movie are: storyline (not very good) and TOO much CGI and action scenes. I think Sommers intended for this movie to be scary, but unfortunately, it's not. It seems to be a LOT more of an action movie than horror.<br/><br/>The problem with the storyline is, well, vampire babies??? Why couldn't the vampires just sire a bunch of people and start some kind of chain reaction. The only good part about the storyline is Gabriel's background and amnesia and connection to Dracula, but we don't see enough of that. Sommers tries to combine the stories of vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein's monster all in one movie, but it just seems like everything is simply thrown together. The only reason Frank's monster is there is for the vampire babies and the only reason the werewolves are there is because they are deadly to Dracula. Speaking of which, the issue of the werewolf antidote and Dracula's control over werewolves is very confusing. The acting wasn't bad, but the accents certainly were. The brides acted over the top at times.<br/><br/>On to the good points. Visually, this movie is great. The architecture of the castles and buildings is beautiful. The monsters are all taken to the next level. The vampire brides turn into harpy-like beings and Dracula transforms into a gargoyle/bat-like demon (though it looks very CGI). The design for Frank's monster was really cool. The werewolves have huge fangs, move very fast, and transform by ripping their skins off! (But they also look CGI).<br/><br/>Overall, I give it 5 out of 10. It would have been great if there were less over-dramatic action scenes and explosions and more attention to a better story that actually keeps you interested. I keep wishing that Sommers had made some kind of a psychological thriller with these characters. That would have been awesome and we would have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the characters and events in the story."

","it is very cold outside and there is a Wanning Gibbous moon in the sky. The moon started low and now van helsing has come on out of nowhere. So I have grabbed my emergency box of candy coated raisins, made some popcorn and hot chocolate, and opened a pack of oreos. The time is at hands, heated blanket on, lights out, camera, action, oh my! I find this movie to be excellent mainly because my expectations were so low in the first place. So, it has transcended into a pleasant surprise! Kate Beckinsale has captured my heart once and for all with her seductive independence and quite capable acting talents. Kate is not at all overshadowed by the great Van Helsing, AKA Hugh Jackman, who I thought did a pretty good wolverine in X-Men. Shuler Hensley played a quite remarkable Frankenstein's monster, slow primitive but with a college education, Boris Karloff would be impressed. Yep, that Stephen Sommers is something else besides a talented, perhaps genius? I like the concept of sheriff of vatican city. like Robin hood but this of course is obvious. The reference scene to 007 and Q was a nice surprise and kinda cute as well as entertaining and funny. The Dr. jekyll and Mr Hyde fight sequence was seat riveting, dynamic, most impressive and well done. Only Spencer Tracy was better. I reckon I oughta mention Dracula, Richard Roxburgh. I thought he was a better Dracula than either Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise, because he stuck to the Bela Legosi format. The only difference between Roxburgh and Legosi is class. I liked the classy Dracula but am a devoted fan of Legosi. Thats just the way it is I guess. Like Neecie from housekeeping would say, ""Lots a carryin on in this movie""! Well gotta watch it again, so long!"

","First & foremost to be as honest as virtue!!! This was a downright terrible movie, nothing almost more terrible than this, not excluding League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen{Also a terrible-movie} Just the way the creatures look is downright terrible, all the cgi used in movies like The Incredible Hulk, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, & most especially Van Helsing. I I like the way they did 80's movies way-better, because for RoboCop for example, they just had him wear a suit that looked robotic & yet that is probably just exactly what a true-life Robocop would look like.<br/><br/>Another thing is I had these Gothic-fantasy interests during the time of the 9/11 terrorist-attacks, most especially an interest in PS1 game Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night, I mean I never played it during that time, but it was an extremely rigorous interest then, and it's why & can't feel the good-associations or warm-feel I once had with it & Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time{An n64 game} anymore. Another thing, even though movies like Rambo were extremely cheesy at least they had a warm/colorful feel. But what's even worse about these Current-decade 2000's films that use CGI & all that kind of stuff, is they generally go for that cold/icy, ethereal blue/gray/silver colors which I especially hate. I love the Rambo or Chuck Norris movies for they're warm exotic-colors. It's really the cold-looking cheesiness I don't like such as a film like this.<br/><br/>End Of Review!!!"

","Even with star power & great special effects,""Van Helsing"" does little to enthrall moviegoers or take in big bucks at the box office. Seen more as a tribute to classic horror films such as The Werewolf(Lon Chaney) & Dracula(Bela Legosi), ""Van Helsing"" just does not have the ""bite"" that hardcore sci-fi/horror/adventure fans love. The performances of hunk Hugh Jackman(X-Men) & Kate Beckinsale(Underworld) are mediocre at best while Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula stole the film. David Wenham(Lord of the Rings) provided some comedy relief while the rest of the cast seemed to fade into the scenery. ""Van Helsing"" will please some, but the most fickle of film goers will scoff at the acting performances & cheesy storyline.<br/><br/>""Van Helsing"" chronicles the adventures of Gabriel Van Helsing(Jackman), Vatican orphan & monster hunter. Upon an unsuccessful mission in Paris to capture Mr. Hyde(Robbie Coltrane), Van Helsing returns to the Vatican to meet with Cardinal Jinette(Alun Armstrong) for his most important mission ever. With bumbling friar Carl(David Wenham) by his side, Van Helsing travels to Transylvania to destroy the fiendish Count Vladislaus Dracula & loyal assistant Igor(Kevin J. O'Connor), who plans to unleash his offspring onto the world to feed. In order to complete his evil plan, Dracula must have Dr. Frankenstein's monster's energy in order to bring his vampire babies to life. After fighting off Dracula's brides & the Werewolf(Anna's brother, Velken),Van Helsing, Anna, & Carl attempt to hide Frankenstein's monster from Dracula & his minions. They are attacked by the Werewolf & Dracula's brides, escape, but Van Helsing is bitten by the the Werewolf. To make matters worse, Anna is kidnapped & taken to Dracula's castle & Frankenstein's monster is captured. Van Helsing & Carl successfully save Anna but are over matched by vampires.<br/><br/>Not discouraged, the three heroes find a way to follow Dracula to his remote stronghold to save Frankenstein's monster & the world from certain doom. With a torn piece of a magical painting & his mystical ring, friar Carl finds out how to kill Dracula & the way for Van Helsing to do it. Since bitten by the Werewolf, Van Helsing will turn when the full moon rises & will be able to destroy Dracula. Dracula owns the potion to rid Van Helsing of his curse of lycanthropy. But first, three have to get the antidote from a well-guarded room in Dracula's castle. Once the three are transported to Dracula's castle, Carl & Anna get the antidote with Igor's help & Van Helsing goes after Dracula. Once transformed into a werewolf, Van Helsing battles Dracula to the death. Van Helsing triumphs, thus destroying Dracula's offspring. Tragically, Van Helsing attacks Anna and kills her while she attempted to inject him with the serum. Van Helsing & Carl burn her body in proper fashion on a great mountain near her village. Van Helsing, grieving Anna's death, looks on to new adventures.<br/><br/>Not a bad flick but has too many low points. Jackman & Beckinsale work okay together but have no romantic chemistry. Only great CG & scene-stealing Richard Roxburgh keep this film afloat. Give ""Van Helsing"" a look but do not expect a lot."

","--I love that line from the movie, said by Kate Beckinsale. Now back to the point: This movie is about a notorious monster hunter, Van Helsing, who is sent to Transylvania to protect the two siblings Anna and Velkan Valerious before Count Dracula kills them before they do. Why? If Count Dracula kills the both of them before they do, they will condemn the whole family to eternal damnation. Van Helsing is also sent there to stop Count Dracula who is using Dr. Frankenstein's research and a werewolf to make his and his wives children born.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call this a CGI overload. I would call this a piece of entertainment! This is a great popcorn film with many great special effects with great action sequences! The movie is entertaining to the beginning through the end, although it's over two hours long. This movie takes all of the old monster movies into one whole movie. I would compare this movie to The Brothers Grimm, which takes all of the fairy tales into one movie.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film might be off to a great start like any other Frakenstein movie when the famous line is called out: ""It's Alive!"" The beginning is black and white, like the old movies, for about 7 minutes and it's over from there. As you can see, the monsters being featured in this film are the Wolfman, Frakenstein, and Dracula and maybe including some other tid bits. The way a human who turns into a wolf is unique. The human actually tears its own skin off revealing fur and it does the same thin when they turn back into a human.<br/><br/>One problem in the movie is that this movie is too long. It's over two hours long but I still enjoyed it like any other popcorn movie. This is a great action adventure that will be great for all ages and I highly recommend this film. This film will make you feel like a kid again! Actually, this is my first film comment that is this long!"

The Vatican is an interesting touch, gave me a good laugh. It starts off the film in black and white, so you know it's the past, not the present, and it is true to both Dracula, by Bram Stroker, and Frankenstein to some extent. It provides laughs, moral issues, and hide behind the sofa moments to please any taste, and with the animated prequel, The London Assignment, what more could you want? However, much as I love the film, I was so confused over the whole Angel Gabriel affair that I just rented the book from the library today.

","Van Helsing is a reunion of classic monsters set to Stephen Sommers' signature roller-coaster pacing. It is a Saturday matinÃ©e treat which pays just homage to the Universal and Hammer studios chillers of the past, while introducing a new (and vigorous) slant on the title character. Thankfully, this is not a new era horror film, wherein traumatizing the audience is considered to be critical accomplishment. Instead, a likable and very capable cast usher the audience through this creepy fun-house of trapdoors and eerie shadows. When the lights come back up and the popcorn bags hit the floor, all is well.

Now, since I'm a girl, partly why i think this movie is awesome is because Hugh Jackman is so damn hot. And Kate Beckinsale is a very beautiful actress, so its a perfect cast for the movie, in my opinion. Both are fabulous actors and they can keep it serious while also having fun. The outtakes of this movie are funny i think. Well..you got you handsome monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman) and your beautiful gypsy princess and vampire hunter Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). While Van Helsing has lost his memory, Anna has to live with the awful memory of her parents death and also her more recent brothers. Upon being attacked by Dracula's brides i the beginning of the movie, Van Helsing is sent to destroy Dracula and ends up meeting Anna and saving her life. The two decide to hunt Dracula together and Anna must stay alive to defeat Dracula which adds to Van Helsings pressure. They go to Castle Frankenstine to find Dracula using her werewolf brother as a power source for his children to come alive. Anna is separated from Van Helsing during the chaos and she finds her brother. She tries to save him since he has not yet changed into his werewolf form, and unfortunately he starts to transform and attacks her. Meanwhile, Van Helsing meets Dracula and he stabs him with a silver steak, only to find it doesn't work and then after the next chaotic scene passes, he retreats to get Anna,saying her again, and they end up being alone for two days. After everything plays out, Anna and Van Helsing finally have their first kiss and he ends up saving her family and freeing their souls so they can go to heaven(because he killed Dracula). However in a desperate attempt to save Van Helsing from the werewolf curse(which happened after he and Anna were shacked up for two nights out roaming around and falling through that old windmill)she lunges at him trying to inject the cure into him,but he pounces on her unable to help it and the force of him landing on her causes her spine to snap and it instantly crushes her. A very tragic ending, Van Helsing holds her in his arms howling at first then he regains his human form and the howls become crys. the only woman he ever truly loved had died. And she is also forced to watch the only man she has every truly loved walk on alone in life without her and her without him. i gave this movie a 10!!!!It really deserves a 50 though.(laughs) Kyotaku, the stray cat."

","Hugh Jackman trys for his own action franchise with the adventurer/monster killer Gabriel Van Helsing. A man with a past he cannot recall, employed by a secret religious order to wipe out evil from the world. We first see Van Helsing going toe to toe in Paris with Mr Hyde, vicious alter ego of Dr Jeckyl. Hyde is huge and orge-like, voiced by Robbie Coltrane and done completely in CGI. I liked this movie. Hugh jackman has a highly likable screen presence ( i think if he kicked Little Red Riding Hood to death and then machine gunned Bambi i would still like him ). Kate Becknsale is very beautiful and kicks ghoulish butt with the best of 'em. Richard Roxborough makes a deliciously camp Dracula. The three actresses to play the brides of Dracula ( Silvia Colloca, Josie Maran, Elena Anya) are a standout- sexy and scary- they were quite unnerving in places, particularly with the glowing eyes and the sadistic laughter. 'Oklahoma' star Shuler Hensley made Frankenstein's monster a pitiable wretch behind the mask. David Wenham was funny as the bumbling Q- like monk who provides Van Helsing with the gadgets. The special effects were top notch, the werewolf was brilliant, and the fight between Van Helsing/werewolf and Dracual/bat thing was well done. i loved the evil little Dwergi waddling about the old castle. In short this movie has a high watchability factor, helmed by Stephen Summers ( a fan of the old RKO horror movies) with evident affection for the movies he spoofs, putting plenty of 'in-jokes' for fans to spot. I recommend it to anyone who likes action adventures with heart and humour."

","'Van Helsing' is, in my opinion, a very good film that stands on it's own. I realize that the director's intention was to tie this in with the Universal horror films made in the 1930s and 1940s, but he failed. For example: 1. In the 1931 version of 'Dracula', the famous monster-killer's name was Abraham Van Helsing, not Gabriel Van Helsing.<br/><br/>2. In the 1931 version of 'Frankenstein', The Moster doesn't talk at all. The Monster in this film, however, speaks perfect English. This is a homage to Mary Shelley's original Gothic-novel first published in 1818.<br/><br/>3. 'The Wolf Man', released in 1941, was not a topless creature that stood God-knows how many feet tall. The Wolf Man's hair is a brownish-hazel, and he wears clothes. The Wolf Man in this film has a brown-like color to him, and he is topless. Just a little thing I found.<br/><br/>4. The Kate Beckinsale roll is not in either 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', or 'The Wolf Man'.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is stunning. However, I would have liked more make-up for The Wolf Man, and less CGI for Count Dracula (in human form).

This makes him obviously more than average human size but does not explain how he managed to survive a 60ft drop into a fire with a building collapsing on top of him, as he was made of human body parts it is hard to believe that he was able of this.<br/><br/>But film does deserve its two awards and it is a good modern remake of the 'old style' monster movies."

It seemed that they worked hard on many of the costumes. But it seems, also, that they went much too overboard on some of them, or hadn't thought of them enough. Some things that happened, or were said, seemed to be completely irrelevant with everything else, such as Kate Beckinsale's, or Anna's, weird obsession with the sea.

Maybe if, like video games, the movie came with a manual, explaining the rules that each character can play by, it would be helpful. Some can die; oops, I guess they can't. Some can fly; oops, I guess not. How do you kill those already dead? I am a big fan of the classic horror genre. When I saw the trailer to this at another film, I was really excited. I thought maybe a young Van Helsing would be a little more cerebral. He is just kind of a supernatural bounty hunter who goes on and on and on. Where does he find the energy. Personally I like the guy with the thick glasses who is not afraid to look into the eyes of Lugosi's Dracula and tell him off. ""There are things worse than death, Mr. Van Helsing!"" Dracula says. Maybe this movie is one of them."

","Van Helsing is Universals homage to classic monsters Dracuala, the wolfman and Frankenstein., and just for the record its a pretty darn good homage at that. The story goes as follows Van Helsing played by an effective Hugh Jackman is a monster hunter who is used by the Catholic Church to vanquish evil. He is sent to Transylvania were he meets Princess Anna played by Kate Beckinsale who whilst not exactly putting in a great performance does remain very sexy. There he finds out that her family are ruled over by an evil curse and that they will never enter heaven until the evil count dracuala is killed. The film is silly.It is not a masterpiece but it is good fun. I was not expecting to see it get a high user rating and indeed at 5.3 out of 10 it certainly doesn't however to me Van Helsing is easily a 7 due to the fact it is spectacularly enjoyable and very camp throughout. Richard Roxburugh was not an inspired choice as Dracuala as he makes quite a hash of it but everyone else is at least average in their role. In fact Hugh Jackman was born to play Van Helsing as he adds great style to a great character. I have to hand to Sommers and his crew, the movie has great effects and is well edited throughout. The script is often sharp and always silly so it is an easy movie to enjoy. Its not perfect but hell Van Helsing is one cool way to start a summer season."
"dvdba","7","0","1","11 March 2006"," Satire,spoof or semi-serious?
","Satire,spoof-or a semi-serious horror movie? Director/writer Stephen Sommers combines all three in this enjoyable flick which I dug up in my local library. Indicates it wasn't a howling box office or DVD success! Van Helsing is full of references to other past movies such as The legendary 1939 Hunchback of Notre Dame,starring Charles Laughton as the batty bell-ringer. I won't spoil your fun. See how many references you can spot yourselves. Then there are characters from other horror classic tales who make freaky ""guest appearances"" like Mr Hyde, played by marvellous British character actor Robbie Coltrane. Coltrane is equally adept at turning his hand to both comedy or serious drama such as the highly-acclaimed British crime series Cracker. So he's ideally cast in this deft mix of spoof and real blood-curdling horror. The plot - if you can call it one - revolves around the notorious monster hunter Van Helsing,played by rising Australian star Hugh Jackman. Being a Melbourne-based entertainment writer, I was familiar with Jackson's pre-Tinsel Town work. He first showed his star quality in an Australian TV prison drama Correlli where he played an inmate who had an affair with a female warder. It wasn't long before Hollywood beckoned the gifted young actor. I have a gut feeling that director Sommers told Jackman to adopt fellow Aussie actor Mel Gibson's transpacific accent. Because he sounds remarkably like Mel in places. The writer/director also has Van Helsing wear an Australian bush ranger's hat! A private joke between him and Jackman?! Another top down under thespian Richard Roxburgh co-stars as Count Vladislaus Dracula. What a superb performance,too. Roxburgh plays it dead straight - and there are some really spine-chilling moments. In fact,when the dark menace of Vlad appears, it's a scream a minute...as he stakes out his victims. He unleashes some truly horrible creatures-including the sexy lycra-clad Harpies,who are very lustful,vengeful ladies indeed (!) - and those terrifying teeth-baring,blood-drooling were-wolves. Stunning British actress Kate Beckinsale is the truculent Transylvanian Gypsy Princess Anna who attracts the attention of Van Helsing - and Dracula. Van Helsing's intentions towards the heroine are honorable - but the salacious Count only wants to sink his fangs into Anna's pristine white neck. The special effects creators have done a brilliant job on what I would think wasn't a massive budget. You can almost hear the studio props creak! Today's savvy film-goers want their special effects to surround-sound them out of their seats. But,nevertheless,director Sommers shows plenty of flair and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of his product-with bigger budgets-in the future. Meanwhile, it was great just to sit back and enjoy a cleverly-made movie."

","I looked up the entry for ""Too much of a good thing"" in Wikipedia, and there was a promotional poster for ""Van Helsing"" in the second tag.<br/><br/>OK, not really. But after seeing the hammering this movie took from the critics, I had to ""see this marvel with mine own eyes!"" (to quote Earthworm Jim) in order to see what could spark such enmity. And after sitting through 2 1/2 hours or more of roller-coaster plotting, thundering sound design, apocalyptic orchestral riffs and zillions of dollars worth of special effects and CGI, I had to say...that it's not so much that the movie is bad, as that exhausts the viewers' patience after an hour or so.<br/><br/>The best metaphor I can come up with is to compare the movie to eating 3 boxes of ""Captain Crunch"" at one sitting. Now, ""Captain Crunch"" was one of my favorite breakfast cereals as a callow youth, and in fact I still like it immensely as an occasional treat. It is the very essence of the ""frosted sugar bomb"" that kids love. And ""Van Helsing"" is both vivid and crisp and shallow and delicious and cloying the way that a good 99% sugar breakfast food should be. But ""Captain Crunch"" gets old fast if you have to eat it past your normal satiation point...and so does ""Van Helsing."" I loved the costumes and the character designs, and I thought the cast did a great job with the overwrought, overheated, overstuffed screenplay and I thought that maybe 70% of the CGI effects were reasonably convincing, and there were some very nice touches here and there that added a lot of punch to the movie (Sommers has been good at this kind of stuff ever since his remake of ""The Mummy"")...but after about 90 minutes, I just wanted it to be over, while the movie still had an hour to go.<br/><br/>The solution, of course, is to stop the DVD player every 30 minutes or so and get up, walk around, run an errand or two, then get back to the movie after 5-10 minutes and have at it again. THEN ""Van Helsing"" becomes something you can enjoy. (This is similar to my experience with the first ""Star Trek"" movie and ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""Altered States"".) So yes, if you are a big fan of the old Universal monsters and you have some patience and you enjoy an approach that throws EVERYTHING Sommers can think of into the mix with a plot that jumps around like a bag full of angry ferrets, you'll probably get a bang out of ""Van Helsing"". Otherwise, just avoid it...it will probably irritate and exasperate you."

","Okay, so I gave one grade point for special effects. Otherwise, this movie is best left for teenagers with raging hormones, no girl-friend, and a dark closet. The most annoying performance (from accent to flounce) of all time in Hollywood goes to Kate Beckinsale for her hideous performance as Anna. If I had seen this movie in the theatre, I would have sued for damages. It would appear the true monster in this film is Beckinsale. I don't know what other movies she's been in, so I cannot comment on her overall worth as an actor, but based alone on this performance, I'd say she should be paid in toilet paper because her talent is non-existent and/or crap at best."

","Director Stephen Sommers surprised the world in 1999 with a very fresh take on Universal Studio's classic ""The Mummy"", giving it new life while transforming it from Gothic horror to action-adventure in ""Indiana Jones""' vein.<br/><br/>Now, and after an almost-as-good sequel, he tries it again, this time with the other classic monster from Universal's horror movies: Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. Sadly, this time Sommers does a terribly bad job with the script and what could had been his masterpiece ended in one of the most awful movies of 2004: ""Van Helsing"".<br/><br/>Using the name and the mystique of the famous vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"", Sommers links the three monsters by turning the old scientist into some kind of Vatican's 007 complete with fantastic artifacts and macho attitude.<br/><br/>The idea, at its very core, is very good, after all, who better than Van Helsing to fight the classic monsters of Universal's golden age of horror? Too bad that the idea was developed with bad results.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman stars as Gabriel Van Helsing, an agent of the Vatican whose job is to kill monsters. He is sent to Transilvania to save a gypsy family who has been fighting vampire king Dracula for centuries; their problem: if the family line extinguishes before Dracula's death, the entire clan will go to hell. To make things worse, there are only two survivors: Anna and Velkan Valerious(played by Kate Beckinsale and Will Kemp respectively).<br/><br/>The script is weak. That is the main problem here, since it's full of plot holes that the audience may end up wondering what the hell is the point of the movie. While Sommers tries to put mysteries to keep the audience thrilled, the story goes on circles and never fully develops the potential of the many subplots thrown in there.<br/><br/>To make things worse, the acting is terribly bad in most cases. While Jackman and David Wenham(as Van Helsing's sidekick) do their best with the bad script, the rest of the cast goes over-the-top in scenes that are so unintentionally funny that one ends up wondering if this is not a farcical comedy(like the brilliant ""Young Frankenstein"") instead of Sommers' recent action blockbuster.<br/><br/>Sommers direction still is solid, and the action scenes will keep you on the edge of the seat. The SFX for the most part are very well done and the beautiful locations worth the ticket. It's a shame that the script and the acting ruins what could have been a very good movie.<br/><br/>3/10"

","I loved the idea of Van Helsing as a character - in fact I loved it in 1993 when it was announced that Anthony Hopkins was about to reprise the role from Coppoloa's Dracula in a film called 'The Van Helsing Chronicles' - the whole idea of a monster hunter, while not original is always appealing (in fact I kind of wished that instead of 'The Mummy Returns' Sommers had made a sequel about Evie and Rick facing up against another of the Universal monsters.<br/><br/>However, Van Helsing shot its wad severely by including three (four if you include Mr. Hyde) of the established heavy hitters of the Universal stable in the first film. Who was left? The Invisible Man, The Gill Man and The Phatom of the Opera.<br/><br/>It sort of aped the philosophy of the later Universal films when they were trying to grab audiences in the later, declining years - slam as many monsters in as you can. Now that was alright for the Monster Squad as it was a one off film but with a potential franchise it was an incredibly stupid mistake.<br/><br/>Also, the fact that Sommers seems to have lost any of the leanness of story telling that made Deep Rising and The Mummy such fun that the whole affair became so damned bloated that it effectively screwed up a character that could have had a lot of potential and that's the tragedy.<br/><br/>The storyline was so bloated that it became difficult to care for any of the characters and some of the choices for characterisation smacked heavily of TV Pilot movie sensibilities - Van Helsing did not need to be immortal (or whatever muddied nonsense was hinted at in his final confrontation with Dracula).<br/><br/>The acting was fine from Jackman, Wenham and Beckinsale - was superb from Frankensteins monster, was bland from the wolf man and was almost unwatchable from Dracula and his Brides - it was almost as if Richard Roxborough (an actor I usually rate) thought that the movie was 'Carry on Dracula'.<br/><br/>A terribly wasted opportunity that did the unforgivable thing - by becoming an action film that became boring and turgid."

""Hey, it's a summer movie -- it's not supposed to be a timeless classic, but just some brainless fun you can eat your popcorns by,"" I thought. ""It has a promising leading duo and a lot of monsters, so how bad can it be?"" Well, the answer turned out to be: utter crap. Two major problems: the script is awful (which should not surprise anyone, and this alone would not trouble this sort of movie at all), and the cast is horrible. Two notable exceptions are Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale: Jackman is a fine choice for the leading role, but he is not given much to work with, and Beckinsale looks nice and spicy, but she's given nothing else to do. They also seem to have absolutely no chemistry between them. The rest of the cast is so recklessly awful you'd be hard pressed to find such lack of talent in the most backward theatre of the planet.<br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh is the worst Dracula ever, by a margin the size of the moon. Apparently his vision was that Dracula became such a loathed figure because of his loud-mouthed, goofy manners. He is a complete failure, as the performance is stupid, annoying as hell, and yet not at all funny. And it gets worse: both Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor and Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's monster do their very best to top Roxburgh in a half-witted noisy overacting contest. AND they all are outplayed by Dracula's brides, who hiss, make faces and screech like rabid wombats.<br/><br/>There is nothing entertaining. There is nothing scary. There is nothing funny. There is just a lot of pointless CGI and an abundance of annoyingly bad performances. This is not brainless fun, this is just brainless.<br/><br/>3/10 <br/><br/>(P.S. Oh, and the score which some people here seem to claim makes this movie. If you have seen more than 20 movies, you have practically heard this soundtrack, only probably a better version of it. The score is nothing else but an uninspired two-a-penny variation of the most clichéd string arrangements for spectacle-type movies. It does in no way break the film -- it is probably the closest call to a proper element this movie has -- but most definitely it also does not make this film.)"

","This movie really isn't all that great. If I could sum everything in the movie into one word, it would probably be horrendous. There were many problems I found, such as the animations, the plot, and the things with the monsters. Let me start by talking about the plot. This movie is far too easy to follow, as in, you can tell what is going to happen. It is not a movie that draws you in and keeps you interested, as I was wanting to stop watching after the first few minutes. I can not believe that people have claimed this to have wonderful action. There was not much thrilling action in it, and if there was, it was with animated characters, so the action lost most of its intensity. Also there is the problem of the animations. It is far too easy to tell that they are animated. When you animate something into a movie, aren't you supposed to make it look like it's real? These animations gave themselves away completely, compelling me to laugh when they were talking to the actors. It made me feel as though I was watching a children's cartoon. The biggest problem I had with the movie, however, was the monsters. The so-called ""vampires"" seem to follow every folk lore about vampires that exists (such as stake through the heart will kill them, they have no reflection in mirrors, etc.), yet they can still go out in the sunlight? Yes, most of their time is spent in the dark, but I don't understand why they can attack in the middle of the day. Finally, Van Helsing is rescued from becoming a werewolf by Anna, but yet, while she is giving him the antidote, he kills her. So, in the end, he ends up with nothing. Mainly all that occurs is Van Helsing going off to look for and kill Dracula (who really wasn't ever a vampire... another problem I had) and his ""children"" or all of the monsters that he has created. This movie is a fun, action packed adventure, where you can see animated creatures, go off to fight childhood monsters, such as Dracula and Frankenstein, and in the end, have nothing because the girl that you have (sort of) fallen in love with, dies."

It's actually a cheeseball of a movie, but it's a fun time none the less.

Personally, I feel Dracula would have been all the cooler if he /didn't/ have the cliché eastern European accent.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a decent movie.

"aimless-46","7","0","1","26 March 2005"," An Updated ""Fearless Vampire Killers""
","Of great entertainment value are the ""Van Helsing"" comments and message board postings from people who apparently just don't get it. Parody/satire of horror films has a long tradition and ranges from the obvious (see Abbott & Costello, Mel Brooks, and ""Redneck Zombies"") to the subtle (see ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and ""Evil Dead""). Before reading many of the comments I would have grouped ""Van Helsing"" closer to the obvious, after all the film depicts a Vatican Department modeled on James Bond's Special Weapons ""Q"" Section. But apparently even something so obvious is not registering with many people, if the true measure of a 'subtle' satire is how many people just don't get it, then ""Van Helsing"" certainly qualifies.<br/><br/>They went into this project saying something like: ""let's use digital effects and a large budget to create the most interesting sets in horror movie history, and then use these as a backdrop for a parody of the ""horror genre"". When concerns were raised about the expense for just a comedy, they pitched it as a sophisticated parody that would not get in the way of the average viewer's desire to see a traditional vampire movie. Such a dichotomy allows the movie to generate big bucks at the box office while still providing its makers with an outlet for their creativity. But such a dichotomy means there will be a third group of viewers who cannot suspend belief enough to enjoy it as a horror film and yet will totally miss the parody angle (the only question is whether they too humorless to find enjoyment in such frivolity or are just a little too dim to appreciate it). We see a lot of negative comments from this third group but 'f them if they can take a joke'-or don't get a joke.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a visually awesome scene of the villagers storming a huge castle and burning a windmill; the sets and the music are great. Except for the overacting and the presence of an assistant named 'Egor' or ""Igor"" (see Mel Brooks reference), you would not suspect that this is anything but a serious horror film. Actually at first I thought it might be a high budget commercial and kept thinking Dracula would say he had gotten a great deal on his car insurance. Although this was the best scene in the movie there were several almost as good and each one had a similar restrained level of satire.<br/><br/>The film plays homage to the Karloff/Chaney films, to Abbott and Costello, Mel Brooks, James Bond and The Wild, Wild West. There is a little Phantom of the Opera and even Eli Wallach's best line from 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' (if you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk). In fact they even lift the vampire ballroom scene from ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"".<br/><br/>The individual performances are from the William Shatner School of Over-Acting with Dracula's brides totally stealing each scene in which they are featured. I particularly liked Josie Maran (who had that great scene as the cigarette girl in ""The Aviator"") as Marishka. The costumes are almost as good as the sets. The computer-generated action sequences illustrate all the problems with digital effects, but work fine as satirical devices.<br/><br/>So if you want to see a fun film with unparalleled visuals this is the one. Others who can suspend belief and ignore a few campy elements will enjoy it as a straight vampire picture. But if you are can't suspend belief, are humorless, or don't know the horror genre you should stay away. <br/><br/>Because there are really two movies here, the first viewing withholds most of the viewing pleasure; once you understand what is happening repeated viewings are even more fun."

","From the opening scenes, lifted straight from the classic Karloff Frankenstein, I could see the 'tributes' were beginning. And Sommers didn't disappoint, lifting bits from multiple films, from Star Wars and Indiana Jones to The Wolf Man and John Carpenter's Vampires.<br/><br/>That aside, the film itself was, as a friend put it, a great popcorn film. Entertaining and witty, interesting effects and smooth cinematography. On the other hand, if you're expecting to see The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, check your expectations at the door, because this film is not nearly as clever or original as those films were.<br/><br/>A couple of PROs: The Frankenstein monster's intelligence was a real plus. The one thing that always bothered me about the Karloff films was that the monster was purely animal and had no apparent non-instinctual intelligence. This monster reflects the book much more purely in character, as he becomes intellectual, and, essentially human.<br/><br/>As well, I LOVED David Wenham in this (playing Carl). Those who know him only as Faramir in the LotR trilogy will be pleasantly surprised at his standout performance. Those who've seen some of the other films he's done, like Russian Doll, will be less surprised - though equally amused.<br/><br/>CONs: The ending was LAAAAAAAAME!! I won't post spoilers, but the entire end sequence, after the resolution, was absolutely ridiculously awful. I DID like the resolution, though - although the Archangel Gabriel idea was only mildly over-the-top...<br/><br/>IN THE END: this film is basically a better Dracula 2000, which was a film with a ton of potential and very poor follow-through. I suspect that most people will enjoy this film, but few will wish to see it a second time. A truly entertaining popcorn film. 6.5/10"

About ten minutes in, Van Helsing is fighting Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, tosses him out of a window, and the monster turns back to a human on the way down to his demise, letting loose a hilarious, ""huh?"" before he smacks pavement. Later, in the middle of a calm conversation between Helsing and Dracula, Helsing whips out a cross and shoves it in Dracula's face.

Even the impressive special effects packed action sequences began to get a little dull and repetitive, as every time the good guys got into a tricky situation they always had some handy rope, creeper or electric cable nearby to swing themselves to safety. After a while I thought I was watching a film about Tarzan! <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was wooden and soulless, Kate Beckinsale was the most unconvincing action heroine I have ever seen, surpassed in ridiculousness only by her Romanian Gypsy accent, and the brides... well, I would rather forget about their hammy, screechy overacting altogether. Two small redeeming factors were Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham, both of whom performed their parts with enough aplomb to carry them off, while at the same seemingly conscious of how silly they are being, whereas Jackman and Beckinsale take themselves altogether too seriously.<br/><br/>I wouldn't sit through this mish-mash of a story again, so it definitely doesn't have the same kind of repeat playability as Sommers' Mummy films.

"Libretio","4","0","1","27 February 2005"," A tribute to CGI effects, but not much else
","VAN HELSING <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS<br/><br/>(Color & black and white)<br/><br/>Under orders from a secret Vatican organization, monster-hunter Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) pursues Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) to his Transylvanian lair, where Jackman uncovers a fiendish plot to harness the electrical energy of Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to revive thousands of the vampire's dormant offspring.<br/><br/>Having already plundered cinematic history for his recent monster outings (THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS), writer-director Stephen Sommers reassembled the remaining members of Universal's 'golden age' creatures for this bloated concoction, in which a bare-bones narrative is virtually swamped by an over-reliance on CGI effects. It certainly LOOKS spectacular: Allen Daviau's restless camera swoops and dives around Gothic sets which stretch into infinity, while nightmarish computer-generated creatures swirl across the screen with gravity-defying abandon, accompanied by a ceaseless blast of multichannel digital sound. Sommers is clearly respectful of his source material, but his best efforts are compromised by poor scriptwork, unlike Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" series (for example), which marries similar visual techniques to a strong plot line with subversive thematic undercurrents.<br/><br/>There are two stand-out set-pieces: Dracula's brides (transformed into flying harpies) pursuing Jackman's carriage through a fog-bound forest along the edge of a yawning chasm; and the climactic duel between two Harryhausen-style monsters in the heart of Dracula's castle. Even better, Sommers breaks new ground in the depiction of CGI werewolves, portrayed here as ferocious, super-charged killing machines in some of the film's most frightening sequences (parents of young children take note). Jackman is as personable as ever, though he's barely stretched by the material, and he's given able support by gorgeous Kate Beckinsale (much better here than in the similarly-styled UNDERWORLD) as the native Transylvanian whose family has been decimated by Dracula's unwanted attentions, David Wenham as Van Helsing's travelling companion, and Hensley (buried under Greg Cannom's vivid makeup design) as Frankenstein's creation. Roxburgh's performance as Dracula alternates between camp affectation and genuine malevolence, and he's upstaged by Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran as his ultra-sexy vampire brides. Dancer-turned-actor Will Kemp plays Beckinsale's handsome werewolf brother, and there's a welcome cameo by Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid in the ""Harry Potter"" series) as the monstrous Mr. Hyde.<br/><br/>All in all, VAN HELSING represents a step forward in terms of visual effects technology, but doesn't amount to very much as a movie. In trying hard to please everyone, it ends up being too much and not enough, and it adds virtually nothing to the mythos it seeks to celebrate."

The integration of real and CGI shots is always convincing. The acting never falls below good, and sometimes is excellent.<br/><br/>Most importantly, since it's promoted as an action film, it's stuffed full of action. At the same time, there are scenes that reflect the spirit of the ideas of the original books it portrays.

"RNMorton","7","0","1","5 February 2005"," Great intro
","Wenham: Why is it so important to kill this Dracula? Jackman: Because he's the son of the Devil. Wenham: I mean, besides that... Methinks reports of this movie's lack of quality were overstated. Jackman is a monster-hunter hired in 1880 by the Catholic Church (!!) to travel to Transylvania and take out Count Dracula. Serendipity's Beckinsale is a very attractive and very feisty Transylvanite who's been trying the same on her own without success. Wexham (Lord of the Ring's Faramir) is Jackman's assistant along for some comic relief. If you imagine Jackman as a more talky, continental Clint Eastwood you're pretty close. They have the right concept, the right characters and the right effects (AND the right weapons for Jackman, including an automatic crossbow!), they just didn't seem to have much of a clue on what to do with them after the first 30 minutes. So they just sort of mindlessly recycle confrontations after that point. It's hard to even keep up with things except to become certain that more (often hokey) action isn't always better. You do wonder how many more times Beckinsale can bounce off the walls and still be fine. But I guess it could have been worse and I give them some credit for setting the table so nicely."
"ChibiAnna","5","0","1","30 January 2005"," Pretty but lacking in substance
","Let's see. All the previous flicks that involved Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Jekyll/Hyde, and/or the Tooth Fairy, were hardly known to b cinematic masterpieces. Unfortunately, Van Helsing keeps up the trend: a plastic array of special effects without any message or lasting 'That was COOL!!'.<br/><br/>The original characters- Gabe Van Helsing and Anna (my name! mwee!)- were rather cardboardy. Anna's accent has already been commented on, and frankly, it's awful. Helsing himself is the stereotypical action hero: brave, in love with the leading lady, and otherwise completely personality-free. Karl is also a cardboard cutout for the first half of the movie, only getting some backbone once someone needs to make like Tarzan and swing on a rope.<br/><br/>Dracula ... well, I haven't seen either him or Richard Roxburg before, but I was a bit unsatisfied with his performance. Sensual? Yes- TOO sensual. You are playing the part of a blood-sucking, 400-year-old vessel of pure evil. You CANNOT BE THAT PRETTY. Rrgh! Drac's 'brides' were indeed very pretty. However, their transition scenes often looked unimpressive.<br/><br/>The CGI was eye candy. Being candy, it was gorgeous but left no lasting mark. The werewolves were cute and fluffy (bad move!), and many of the CG scenes were.... well... they were pretty, but fake. So fake. Sighhhh.<br/><br/>However, the cow was cool.<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10. Good-looking popcorn movie. Still not as good as Indiana Jones."

","...There was Van Helsing! The Original Vampire Hunter! When I first saw the movie, I didn't really understand it. It seemed Stephen Sommers was trying to cram Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein all into the same movie. But after several viewings, the plot started to come together. I think its one of the best action movies ever.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is no stranger to the action genre. In X-men, he got his hands dirty as Wolverine. In fact, in some ways, I think Wolverine and Van Helsing are a lot alike. Both are loners, both are fighters, and both are searching for answers. Carl is a genius. I don't know how Van Helsing got by without him.<br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh was great as Dracula. He brought a suave, evil genius persona to the character. This made him both a lady's man and mastermind. All three of the Brides of Dracula were HOT! My favorite was Aleera. She was the best looking, but also the most psychotic. I liked Kevin J O'Connor as Igor. He served as the comic relief for the villains. (You may remember Kevin as Benny in THE MUMMY.) The visual effects in this movie were great, especially the parts where Dracula and his brides turn into vampire form. I thought the brides looked especially terrifying.<br/><br/>To all the fans out there that like a lot of B.S.U (Blowing Stuff Up), this movie will not disappoint you. Hardly a minute goes by without something being blown up, or smashed, or shot. (Movie fans, are you interested?) I love this movie, and if you like lots of action, I know you will, too."
"miken-3","8","0","1","24 January 2005"," Fun and fast paced!
","This movie has amazing special effects and borrows from a lot of the action movie directing that is currently in vogue. Jackman is very likable as a monster hunter hired by the church to eliminate all supernatural creatures and some man-made (Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster).<br/><br/>After disposing of a giant Mr. Hyde in London, Jackman is sent to Transylvania to battle the evil Count Dracula. There he meets up with a beautiful vampire slayer who is also after Dracula for turning her brother into a werewolf. However, she is reluctant to go after him because the townspeople are content to keep status quo with Dracula. Dracula and his vampire wives periodically feed on the townsfolk to satisfy their urges as long as the townsfolk don't hunt them. Any actions by the townsfolk against the vampires would result in terrible retribution.<br/><br/>Van Helsing battles Dracula's wives who swoop and dart through the air around the town while Van Helsing is shooting a ""machine gun"" type bow and arrow. The special effects of these scenes are amazing.<br/><br/>Later, Van Helsing does battle with Dracula with the help of a werewolf and the Frankenstein monster.<br/><br/>We later learn that Dracula can only be killed in one way (that way is revealed late in the movie) but that way is super risky. Meanwhile Dracula is unleashing a plan to launch a vampire army to take over the world. It is up to Van Helsing, his beautiful slayer, and Frankenstein to defeat him and time is running out.<br/><br/>A fun ride to the end."

","This movie's not too great. I had a rough day with my college finals last summer, and so I decided to ease my mind at the theaters. I didn't expect much out of Van Helsing after reading the bad reviews on IMDb, but I was really in the mood for a fantasy/adventure film. So I watched this anyway despite of the negativity surrounding it. Sure enough the acting was way over the top and melodramatic, the plot was thin, and the story loses logical sense at times.<br/><br/>Maybe some people liked Frankenstein, but I thought his role in this movie was absurd. So absurd it was funny that he alone held the key to bringing the born undead to life. I suppose it makes a little sense since he was made up of corpses, but I still felt Frankenstein was forced into this movie to make it a monster fest.<br/><br/>Also Carl reminded me so much of Q in James Bond when he was introducing to Van Helsing the weapons at their disposal. I thought the similarities were hilarious.<br/><br/>Then there was the scene at the end with Van Helsing still in his wolf form holding Anna and wailing. It was suppose to be sad, but it was so weird to see a huge hairy wolf passionately holding a woman wearing a revealing outfit that it was rather funny.<br/><br/>Lastly the shot of Anna smiling from heaven was just too cheesy.<br/><br/>With all this said, I did find this movie bad to the extent of being entertaining. Or maybe I was just really depressed that day. Whatever the case, I took this film as a comedy, and laughed it off. Overall: 5/10."

","It's not funny. It's not a spoof. It's not scary. They tried to make Indiana Jones meets Ghostbusters meets James Bond meets The Hulk. They missed on all counts.<br/><br/>Most of the action/set special effects are good. The character special effects, with the exception of Dracula's Brides and the Frankenstien monster, are not. The werewolves and Mr. Hyde are REALLY bad. The characters in Shrek are more believable than these CGI characters. This especially affects the final battle between the werewolf and the vampire. Where is the tension and drama when the biggest stunts are done by animated characters? The scripted is convoluted and silly. With a strong overlay of religion (Van Helsing is an agent of the Pope in Rome), the absurdity just continues.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is an enjoyable actor. He brings a great deal of likability to his part. Kate Bekinsale and Richard Roxburgh are not very good. Their accents are terrible. They have no screen presence. And why is Ms. Beckinsale wearing her corset outside of her clothing? Lon Chaney Jr. originated the part of the werewolf on film. Bela Lugosi originated the part of Dracula on film. In fact, he only appeared twice on film in the part. The first ""Dracula"" (1931) and the second time in ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein""(1948). After viewing Van Helsing, you come to appreciate the pure honesty of Chaney's and Lugosi's performances.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe, but ""Abbott & Costello meets Frankenstein"" did a better job in bringing Universal Picture's main monster together in one film than ""Van Helsing"" did. And A&B even threw in the Invisible man."

","I was looking forward to watch Van Helsing, probably because there was not much going on around or probably just to keep up to date. I had little expectations about it, the synopsis didn't attract me much, but I wanted something new, so I watched it.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that the opening scene wasn't introducing the main character, and that the author managed to keep the intrigue during the next couple of scenes (c'mon, it isn't something written by the Cohen brothers or Kaufmann, so let's treat it in its weight category!). Of course, I had to filter a fair amount of BS, but that's normal for a heroic flick like that, so bring it on.<br/><br/>The CGI was pretty good, sometimes very good, sometimes annoying - up to the standards in any case, though no matrixish bullet time or whatever. But what for? There's already lots of movies with splashing water circled all around by the virtual camera, just pick a title from the shelf.<br/><br/>The plot, as I've already said, isn't worth mentioning. The salad the Mummy's daddy Stephen Sommers has done out of seemingly all the monster fiction and comic books found on his shelf looks like an unsuccessful marriage of Mary Shelley's mattress dwelling bedbug and Ian Flemming's bastard nephew's chihuahua's flee. And I could probably live much better without the hero/sidekick vs villain/sidekick cliché, but then it would take the author to actually think a lot, so hey, gimme the action, babe and nevermind the self-proclaimed intellectuals! If you have a weak stomach - try not to watch this movie after meal. Some parts are really gross stomach-wise, lots of viscous blob being splattered and lots of squishy looking things jumping around. Yuck.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the movie, it made my evening, so if you don't get tired easily of meaningless plots, can filter BS at some fair ratio and like to watch an action-packed movie with a sometimes creative camera work - go for it. I'd give it a 6 out of 10, it's a solid entertainment flick."

"scarletminded","Null","0","1","27 November 2004"," It's a little bit Bram Stoker's Dracula, a little bit League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
","Spoilers contained here.<br/><br/>Upon viewing this film, I couldn't help but think of both Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) and the film version of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Van Helsing is like an overly and romantically Gothic steampunk film that borrows heavily from both movies.<br/><br/>This film apparently was first going to be a sequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) staring Anthony Hopkins in the Van Helsing role. Instead Van Helsing is turned more into a hip hero of sorts, complete with Fields of the Nephilim outfit (someone will hopefully get this joke). The map inserts of Eastern Europe, along with the carriage chase scene, really remind me of the same style used in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), almost too much so. It still has its roots firmly planned as a sequel.<br/><br/>Van Helsing seems to also rip a bit off of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, with its Hyde chase scene and secret society hunting monsters, using religious men instead of League's Victorian heroes. But Van Helsing would fit great along in the League and it shows. My suspension of disbelief was the idea of all religions bonding together in a brotherhood. That is a bit sketchy. Also sketchy is the fact that Van Helsing has his memory erased and is called ""Gabriel"" by Dracula, leaving a lot of unanswered questions I will get to later. <br/><br/>Dracula in this movie seemed almost whipped by his wives in this one, who wish to see their dead children live. What happened to Dracula here? The actor playing him (Richard Roxburgh) seems very much like Gary Oldman in both looks and manner, except the old Dracula would have kicked out his complaining wives and got three other ones. I suppose that is the difference between a R and a PG-13 rating. Dracula seems lame. A werewolf can kill him. I didn't quite understand why the werewolves he had as servants were actually serving him if they could kill him. The film gives the idea the werewolves have no will, which is weird. I also didn't understand why Dracula controlled all these little German tolls which looked like HR Geiger rejects. Mean buggers...so why were they slaves again?<br/><br/>Despite the claims of the writer in the commentary of the DVD who lives by the ""monster movie rules,"" Van Helsing falls short of a few plot points. Presenting a younger Van Helsing can be a problem. First off, Frankenstein was written in the early 1800's and Dracula in the late 1800's, so it is hard to believe that Igor survived all that time from the early 1800s until the late 1800's. I know that is nitpicking, but I like my Gothic Victorian literature. Second, I was getting confused because it seems silver stakes were being used instead of wooden ones, which kill vampires. Plus the vampire's offspring were being killed by bullets. The vampires attacked by day and I didn't see any scenes other than one, of them sleeping in coffins. Werewolves too, suffer from the lack of adhering to the movie monster rules. They appear during the day in a scene as well. There are a few other rules broken, but I would like to get to the meat of the story and what I thought of it.<br/><br/>The plot line of this movie is that Dracula wants to give a jump of life via lightning bolts and monster sacrifice (want an answer to why he has to use a monster for it...you won't find one) in order to please his nagging dramatic wives who want their children to live. In the meantime, we see Van Helsing, young and apparently not Dutch (why is he always shown as German, English or American?) living it up superhero Vampire Hunter D style, chasing a very League of Extraordinary Gentlemen looking Hyde (of Jekyll and Hyde fame) around a digital Paris. The Vatican soon has Van Helsing reporting for duty to kill Dracula in order to save a dying line of gypsies who have gave their lives dying for the Vatican's secret religious buddy boy Templar clubhouse. The gypsies can't get into heaven unless Dracula is killed. So Van Helsing, with the always added funny sidekick of a friar from the secret society head out to kill Dracula.<br/><br/>When they get to Romania, they aren't welcome until Anna Valerious, played by Kate Beckinsale with off and on gypsy accent and riveted corset recognizes him. Her outfit really bothered me. It was so wrong. She pretty much serves as eye candy with non- period clothing to exist as a plot point. Her brother is assumed missing but is bitten by a werewolf unaware to her. At this point, the very well made Dracula's brides attack. The mix of digital and actor here are wonderful. If I had to give you a reason to see this, it would be for the brides alone, though I was wondering how they went from monster skin and wings to formal wear so quickly in mid-transformation. The brides are my favorite part of the film.<br/><br/>Along the way (as to not explain the whole plot) Anna and Van Helsing encounter the Frankenstein monster and try to protect him from being captured by Dracula and used to bring his babies (who are in alien like pods, yeah, I don't know why either) alive. He tries first to use Anna's brother as the power. It was never explained why a monster was needed to fuel the machine, Victor Frankenstein did well with just lightning and a nice lab. I would have really liked an answer to this question.<br/><br/>Frankenstein's monster gets caught and is strapped to the machine and the bat babies come alive a 2nd time. This is when Van Helsing, bitten by Anna's brother and Dracula have a confrontation. Dracula says Van Helsing killed murdered him when he has a human. But they never tell you why. Nor do they tell you why the Vatican erased Van Helsing's memory. All is well though, because at the end of it all, Van Helsing doesn't want to know. That's convenient! All those visions of him in Roman times don't mean a darn. I thought this was a wonderful point that was never explained and then throw away once Van Helsing says he doesn't want to know. It almost hurt not to know. It was like all this storyline was hidden from me, the whole point of the movie, why did Van Helsing murder the human Dracula? That is the motivation of the movie and it is never explained. That is such a letdown.<br/><br/>Then of course, Dracula and Van Helsing as werewolf, have a showdown via the movie Underworld, minus the guns, but heck, Kate Beckinsale is there anyway! The werewolf kills Dracula very easy, almost too easy. By then we know Dracula has a cure for being a werewolf and Anna gets it just in time to save the day. <br/><br/>Of course in the Gothic style, she pumps him with the needle and he lives but she dies somewhere in the whole brouhaha. It is never explained if the werewolf Van Helsing killed her, her corset was too tight, she wanted to not be in the sequel, nothing is shown of how she died. She is posed as a necrophile's dream on a sofa made of red velvet and spine bones. What the heck is that doing in Frankenstein's/Dracula's lab? She is dead, but no one knows how.<br/><br/>But you see, Anna had to die, even unrealistically, to move the plot along. This way Van Helsing doesn't have anything to tie him down and Anna can be reunited with her family in heaven, a family who couldn't be let into heaven until Dracula died. <br/><br/>I probably give the impression I didn't like this film, but I did. This is a great monster film and well acted. The effects are amazing. The pace is quick and the action is done for a reason, not just because it is an action film. It stays true to the monster film tradition, as far as emotion and shivers go. The whole steampunk bent to the film was very likable. And monsters, monsters and more monsters. I did enjoy when the friar found the panel which had the poem from the Universal classic, The Wolf Man on it. I was glad that was included and I loved the painting coming to life. Dracula's ball was fantastic too. Also, the commentary by the director and writer on the DVD had a lot to offer. <br/><br/>I do wish there was more fleshing out of the plot, more questions about Van Helsing answered. I got the idea that maybe Van Helsing had lived for 1,000 years and indeed was the left hand of God or very close to it. I didn't know if his name was Gabriel or Abraham, because the latter name is never mentioned. There is also that pesky memory wiping plot point that was never answered and made me yell an operatic ""Why?"" much like Frankenstein's monster did. Didn't that Frankenstein's monster have an almost singsong voice at times? Wasn't that almost laughable?<br/><br/>Overall, it is a great watch. I watched Van Helsing with Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning as part of the full moon fright fest last night and it was great! I highly recommended watching those two films together for a howl and a scream."
"Robert_duder","Null","0","1","28 November 2004"," Everyone needs to chill out and enjoy!!
","Van Helsing is not the best action movie I have ever seen, but it's far from the worst. In fact it's one of the better movies I have seen in the last little while. One of the biggest problems with not only this film but most of the current action adventure or fantasy films out there is CGI!! Enough already, it looks like crap, it doesn't look real and it's not impressive. What is impressive is when you watch the original Star Wars trilogy where they had to work to get special effects, blow up models, use miniature creations and puppets. Sadly even George Lucas fell to the CGI disaster in his recent Star Wars films. This is why we aren't enjoying action movies like we used to. In saying that, the CGI in Van Helsing is tolerable if not for any other reason than the story and movie around it. <br/><br/>Stephen Somers previous credits including the CGI heavy Mummy series, including producing The Scorpion King. A good series, as good as Van Helsing. The story revolves around Gabriel Van Helsing, a monster hunter working for a secret organization within the Vatican. He has lost his memory and doesn't remember his background at all. The Vatican sets him up on a mission to destroy the monster of all evil...Count Dracula himself who has decided to use Dr. Frankenstein's creation of life to bring to life thousands of Vampire offspring. The only thing currently standing in his way is a bloodline of people determined to destroy him. Van Helsing teams up with the last of this bloodline, the lovely Anna Valerious to stop Dracula once and for all including his three brides, his children, the werewolf he has been using to help kill.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is it clocks in at just over 2 hours and is not ashamed of that. Finally a film worth paying to see that isn't over in an hour and change. They don't hesitate to tell a story amidst numerous action sequences. The action is literally non stop and certainly far from boring, it's one battle after another, each one creative and original and fun to watch. Van Helsing is played by the amazing Hugh Jackman who is one of the fastest and finest rising stars of recent years. His performance as Wolverine, Leopold, to Stanley in Swordfish has shown him to not be an average action star. He actually acts!! He puts passion and uniqueness into his characters and Van Helsing is no acception. Kate Beckinsale returns in another vampire like movie since Underworld as a kick ass heroine who is determined to avenge her brother's death and kill Dracula with or without help. The romance between Jackman and Beckinsale is very light, barely noticeable but their chemistry together is perfect. David Wenham plays a monk who unwillingly becomes Van Helsing's sidekick. He's funny, and is a great addition to the cast.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent, the story line watchable and the action scenes amazing even with the CGI. One of the perfectly amazing highlights of this film was the character and performance of Shuler Hensley who plays Frankenstein's Monster. This is basically one of his first roles and he's one of the only monsters in the film that isn't CGI'd to death. His character is great anti-hero, compassionate and interesting. I would love to see a spin off following his character if done properly. He was without a doubt my favorite character from the film. I have said this many times before but when watching most action movies you have to let go of reality, forget plot holes and errors (although I didn't find any in Van Helsing) and enjoy. This movie was meant to just be enjoyed, and they accomplish that in a big way. Unlike most I thought the ending was perfect for the movie and had no complaints. Basically the movie is definitely worth watching but won't blow you away. Somers did a great job of giving the film the old Universal Monsters feel to it and the opening scene in black and white helped set the tone. It's pretty had to give an old movie feel to a movie like this but he pulled it off by keeping the old familiar characters pretty true to legend. Dracula who was played by Richard Roxburgh looked and felt just like the old Dracula we all know from the old movies. <br/><br/>As for sequels the basis for franchise was not put firmly in place for this movie which is a good thing for the most part. Doesn't mean it couldn't be done but most likely 99% likely any attempts at sequels would ruin the film and any franchise. Handled properly with care, that 1 % could turn a sequel into an epic trilogy. That's just my opinion. I hope they don't take that risk and leave well enough alone. Van Helsing is a good movie!!<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"dromasca","7","0","1","28 November 2004"," a computer graphics Gothic film
","'Van Helsing' is a remarkable film from a technical point of view. Computer graphics in films became a major trend lately, and the borders between classic animation, computer animation and acting become more and more blurred. If you doubt, just see the four animation films in the US top ten this week, and computer effects playing a visible role in at least another two. As I said, I liked, actually was captivated by the endless imagination in the computer work in this film, and this kept me interested despite the length of the film. <br/><br/>Sure, there is not too much originality in 'Van Helsing'. We get a very strong mix of many of the horror stories of the 19th century. The only original idea was re-defining the Vatican as the host of the bigger spy agency of the epoch. The film even has a Mister Q as an important supporting character. Acting is not too bad, but the quality of the film lies mostly in the Gothic atmosphere, the infinite number of monsters, and the landscape created by computer means. Certainly, it is just comics-level geography and history. Do not expect any historic or geographic truth here. Transylvania for example for whoever is interested is 500 kilometers away from any sea. But who cares. <br/><br/>I enjoyed 'Van Helsing' more than I expected. However, I dislike the idea of a second film, and the producers would make a big mistake to try to create a sequel. It can't be better than the original in its genre. I am however sure that they did not wait for my advice, and are already doing it to capitalize on the momentum :-) 'Van Helsing' gets 7 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","Van Helisng... a name with a sharp hum and a man with a holly mission-to be God's Left Hand of justice against the ancient and forgotten evil which still lingers on. He's the only one whose name scatters the dark creatures ...But who is he really? Well, he's not some sort of saint or preacher; the great thing about Van Helsing, as with the movie, is the breath of fresh air it provides. Van Helsing has his own worries and private quests, which he puts aside in favor of his duty. Although faced with diabolical foes, he doesn't lose his optimism, he doesn't give up, not even when things take a turn for the worse, finding help in true friendships and answers in the questions themselves. Overall the movie is a new spin of the old tale, where the monsters, no matter how dark and rash, have hearts of their own and even worries and the heroes, no matter how right or just, can still make mistakes like all of us. A wonderful display of state of the art special effects and breathtaking sets, clever lines and one masterpiece of a soundtrack! Funny, dark, emotional and dynamic, but not violent or pathetic, 'Van Helsing' is the movie to watch if you're looking for a change!..."

If I were to base my grade of this movie soley on visual effects/set/direction I would give it a 10. Unfortunately, the acting was horrible. In general, I think Hugh Jackman is a decent actor, but I didn't find him convincing as Van Helsing. And Kate Beckingsale, while nice to look at, couldn't act her way out of a shoebox. The actor that played Dracula made me laugh more than convince me he was really evil. Overall, I'm not sorry I watched this movie. It is entertaining. But, it could have been better."

This movie is on the good side and it rocks. You'll definitely enjoy the spectacular SFX along with chilly atmosphere, classic horror story and good casting (Mr.Jackman was a VERY good choice)... and a surprise ending too.

"DeadlyHedley007","10","0","1","9 November 2004"," Hugh Jackman is the most talented actor we have today
","I have watched Van Helsing more than once. Although there is very little script for the talented Mr Jackman to work with he can sure make it count. The one liners and timing of delivery are first rate with the exact touch of tongue in cheek. The special effects were many - perhaps too many we could have done with a little more from Hugh and Kate but the script did not allow this. This was not planned to horrify the viewers it was planned to entertain us and in my case it certainly work. The OTT Dracula was a real laugh, the bad guy turning good [Frankenstein] was a real touch of days gone by - it used to touch the most hardened hearts. We use to love that. Carl {David Wenham - I apologise if I have not spelt this correctly] and Hugh worked together wonderfully. <br/><br/>Although Van Helsing and Anna did not really get to know each other intimately I found Hugh did it again - he made me cry with him when Anna died. Gosh he has got such talent, breath taking looks and of course when you go behind the scenes - what a personality as well. But it was apparent there were many people involved in this film all working extremely hard and it was a joy to see so many of the cast and crew getting on so well. Seems to be like that when Hugh is around. I am, as always, looking forward to the next film.<br/><br/>Deadly Hedley"

I thought the acting was alright but the story was just too much at times. I think the director just crammed in too many characters; vampires, werewolves, frankensteins and a whole host of other stuff.<br/><br/>The standout aspect for me though, which I believe does deserve to be congratulated is the sets/location-cgi.

"bbagnall","Null","0","1","2 November 2004"," Hollywood writers/directors need a basic physics course
","This film starts off very promising with an ass-kicking opening sequence featuring Dr. Frankenstein, his monster, and Dracula. I loved the touch of Frankenstein with his steam-piston left leg, which shot out a jet of steam with each step. So many of the performances are pure gold, such as Dracula, Igor, Carl the Friar (played by David Wenham of Lord of the Rings), and Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing. The character of Van Helsing also has a lot of potential, and could be a superb action character. (Here comes the however...) However, it soon starts to become tiresome for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>First, the CGI effects are just too cartoony. It's like the animators said, ""If creatures moving at 50 miles per hour look great, then moving at 300 miles per hour will be even better. If a huge werewolf is great, then a 10 foot tall werewolf is even better! If people falling 15 feet and surviving is great, then people falling 100 feet and surviving is even better."" Unfortunately, sometimes these things just make it seem less believable.<br/><br/>Scenes near the end are ludicrous. Kate Beckinsdale swings from several cables across a chasm, while an assistant throws her a syringe, which she catches midair. Then she gets thrown off the rope, bounces off several stone columns and lands on her back on some cement steps from a drop of about 50 feet. It's okay everyone, she's alright! Yes, even though she has no special powers, she dusts herself off and continues on. That's just the kind of film this is.<br/><br/>Best end credits ever, though."
"DarthBill","Null","0","1","1 November 2004"," Not as bad as all that but still no classic Spoiler
","In yet another odd attempt to re-translate Victorian British characters as fantastical ""super heroes"", Hugh Jackman plays Gabriel Van Helsing, the alleged younger brother of Abraham Van Helsing from the Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" stories. This Van Helsing is a kind of amnesiac world trotting super-spy/assassin who goes around whacking monstrous creatures that threaten man kind and what not. After a bad run in with Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, he is sent to dispose of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) with squeamish monk/gadget man Carl (David Wenham) in tow along with a shapely princess named Anna (Kate Beckinsale). Along the way they encounter the Frankenstein monster and some werewolves, but are these as horrible as the secrets of Van Helsing's missing past?<br/><br/>Not exactly ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but not as bad as all the critics would have you believe. There are some weaknesses in story structure and some over done stunts that could have used more restraint and logic (it actually feels LESS professional than Stephen Sommers more light-hearted ""Mummy"" films). Jackman plays his part well enough, despite hitting a few sour notes. David Wenham is somewhat funny as his cowardly Q sidekick (but how do you go from playing Faramir in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, winning the hand of the fair Miranda Otto/Eowyn to playing Hugh Jackman's wimpy sidekick?). Richard Roxburgh goes all out over the top as Dracula & Kate Beckinsale basically stands around heaving her chest at the audience. Although I'm not a fan of Kate Beckinsale, I found her death at the end of the film rather came out of left field and should have been left on the cutting room floor (unless the idea was to make VH darker than the Mummy films). <br/><br/>Go ahead and rent it. It's really not that bad."

","This movie had a lot of hype prior to its release in the theaters, but upon hearing nothing but boo's from people who saw it not to mention seeing mediocre ratings from IMDb I waited till it was out on DVD. After finally seeing it I wished I had seen it in the theaters. I don't see what people disliked so much about this movie. The acting was good, the special effects and cinematography were pretty top notch, and the story was pretty involved, so what people hated so much about this movie I don't know<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was good in the leading roll, and I thought that the supporting cast was good as well. If there were any complaints about the acting I'd have to say that I thought that the actor who played Dracula was a bit lacking as he just didn't seem right for the part. But other than that I thought the movie was great and very entertaining. Movies like this are popcorn movies and while it was a fairly serious movie, it had enough comedy and light heartedness to make it fun. Maybe that was its major downfall was that it didn't take itself serious enough to be this epic movie that it sought out to be. Also I went in with pretty low expectations given all the negative feedback, so maybe that helped my opinion a bit, but all in all I thought it was very entertaining. Also, the DVD has some extra goodies so if you liked it check out the bonus stuff as well.<br/><br/>7 / 10 for me. My all time favorite vampire movie is still Bram Stoker's Dracula holding strong as #1, with Interview with a Vampire as #2 for its unique story. Van Helsing would probably be tied with Blade for #3.

","Van Helsing is the latest installment of Steven Sommers. It is not about curses or mummies, but has the same general hokiness and camp that I expect from the movies he's directed so far. Partially the delivery and feeling is due to the actors. The movie wouldn't have worked if they'd taken it seriously. The whole point of movies such as this are the delivery of the lines, and how well it's written, if it doesn't make you giggle or at least smile, then the movie hasn't done it's job. Van Helsing is not the best Steven Sommers has done, but for the most part it delivers.<br/><br/>Reviewers said there were too many special effects, too many sequences devoted to action. The answer is yes, there are too many. This movie tends to suffer from ""I have too much money to burn through let's use it all."" One of the charms of The Mummy was the fact that there was one threat and the good guys had to deal with it. Special effects were used only for when the mummy was rebuilding itself and the minions fighting Brendan Fraser's character. The rest of the movie properly had a love story with the action.<br/><br/>Sommers should have left it at that with Van Helsing. The characters are interesting, he brings up good mystery with Van Helsing by giving him a past he doesn't know. But just as we might get too interested, the movie is over-run with too many plots. And, though I hate to say this, too much action.<br/><br/>I enjoy action sequences as much as the next, but I like to see some better reason for them. The point of action is to be paced well, like all good things there must be some respite for the watcher as well as the character. Is there a reason why he does what he does? Or a love story in Van Helsing? Definitely there are hints of attraction, but that's pretty much as far as it goes for the guy. Why? because he can never catch a break when fighting bad guys.<br/><br/>Overall the acting is well done, what there is of it, with overtones from the other films that each of the actors have been in. There are also the inevitable echoes of The Mummy, especially whenever Kevin J. O'Connor is on screen. <br/><br/>So, should you see this movie? Yes it's a wonderful thing for an otherwise empty night, and if you're an old horror movie fan, or just love Young Frankenstein, then you'll love the opening sequence.

","If this is what Stephen Summers can do for the old 30's and 40's Universal Monster Classic series of films, then the good Lord only knows what is in store for us with ""Flash Gordon""!<br/><br/>This is one of the best summer movies since the first ""Mummy"", also from Summers. Just like in that film, he's taken the standard mythology of an established series and introduced it to high-tech modern day film production. The integration between live-action photography and computer generated graphics is as seamless as I've ever seen, and puts ""The Hulk"" to shame. Remember that they are moving the camera and establishing a path for a character that will be digitally inserted later and then you begin to appreciate the expert technical efficiency in which the film was produced. The actors chosen are all professionals and know how to do their job, Roxburgh is given special notice for his ballsy performance as a Dracula that expertly modulates between euro-trash sexy and full-blown campy. Beckinsale does her usual impersonation of a wooden plank, the role did not require much effort in my opinion. Her accent is amusing for all the wrong reasons, same as in ""From Hell"" with Heather Graham. And just as Graham has no idea how bad her accent is in ""From Hell"", Beckinsale is also clueless, but it adds to the charm and enjoyment of the film. Silvestri's score is among the best he has ever done and Summers should not take the mediocre and lukewarm reception that ""Van Helsing"" got from audiences to heart. The film made some money in its secondary life anyway, which is where 80% of all the returns come from these days.<br/><br/>Summers is nearly at the point of mastering his craft and I am looking forward to ""Flash Gordon""."

","I am glad I didn't see this in the theatre. Renting it allowed me to replay certain scenes to better understand what was going on.<br/><br/>When I first started watching it, I hadn't read any reviews. When Frankenstein made his appearance, I thought ""how hokey!"" Then I read the IMDb user comments and learned that the movie was not for ""purists"" - whatever that means.<br/><br/>So from that point on, I just enjoyed the show. The music added to the fast pace, which allowed me to overlook the inconsistencies and incongruities.<br/><br/>I found the elements of combining all the monsters in one place and time for a reason to be innovative, but not so different from 1950s B-movies link ""Frankenstein meets the Wolfman."" The depiction of the vampires was fresh and much more believable than turning into a bat.<br/><br/>The other thing I liked was when Van Helsing was being outfitted with his special weapons, sort of like James Bond being outfitted by ""Q"" before going on a mission.<br/><br/>So it was worth the Blockbuster rental, but I should have waited until it went off the 2-day return requirement.

","This one is a very nice and entertaining movie, one of the best about vampires I have ever watched. The story is simple, but cool (minor spoiler lie ahead): Van Helsing is a hunter of dangerous monsters. After successful combat with the gigantic Mr. Hyde, he is sent in Transylvania. In this accursed land the mighty vampire lord Count Dracula has evil plans, including Frankenstein's monster and a large, ferocious werewolf. Van Helsing, who allies himself with beautiful Anna (and believe me, she is really sexy), must stop Dracula and save the world of humanity. I really like the idea of so many famous monsters, fighting each other. And I also really liked so many beautiful women in a movie (ahem)... It is not an Oscar-material, but it is a very nice and entertaining film."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","1","23 October 2004"," Too much!
","Man, this movie was way too intense. Normally I like fast paced Hollywood movies with lot's of action and special effects but this movie has just too much action. All of the things are happening too fast after another, the movie doesn't give you time to think or even breath! However does that mean it didn't liked this movie? No that was not the case, I thought the movie was very enjoyable and I find it still recommendable.<br/><br/>Even though there is a special effects overkill, they are impressive to watch nevertheless and probably that alone makes this movie worth to watch. The movie doesn't really have more to offer than that, it feels like the story is just of minor importance and even though Hugh Jackman is good in his role, his character just doesn't really become interesting, which is not his fault. The makers should have probably spend more time on the story and character instead of just the special effects. Maybe if this was the case they also wouldn't had changed Van Helsing's name in Gabriel Van Helsing instead of Abraham which is the original name. Director Stephen Sommers however thought that the name Abraham was just too old fashioned and not cool enough, he didn't want to make a movie in which his main character is named Abraham or so he claimed in a TV interview I saw a long time ago before the movie release. From that moment on I feared the worst for this movie. Yes, a different director would have been more appropriate probably, someone who did had some more respect for all the old horror characters and their names. Van Helsing will always stay the old professor to me and not the action hero like he is portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>Poor Richard Roxburgh. It's not like his Dracula performance is bad but it's just that there have been so many better Dracula's like Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee and Gary Oldman, compared to them his performance turns pale which can also be blamed on the script.<br/><br/>But like I said I still thought this movie was enjoyable. The movie is especially recommendable if you like old horror classics from Universal. The first few minutes are a great tribute to the classics however after that the classic horror characters are only used to impress the viewer with fancy special effects. There are some good action sequences but simply too much. After one hour I already had seen enough action and was surprised to see that I wasn't even halve way trough with watching the movie.<br/><br/>Great special effects, great soundtrack and nice atmosphere but the story doesn't do much justice to the classic characters or the actors in this movie.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"CountOrlock","Null","0","1","22 October 2004"," Watch it twice. You have to like the classic monster films.
","If you're old enough, and familiar with the classic monster flicks this film draws from - in addition to more contemporary ones, and can recognize what Sommers seems to be doing (giving an appreciative nod to them all) - you'll be entertained. I never had the opportunity to see it in the theatre, and honestly I was sort of put off that Van Helsing would be enlarged beyond his character in Stoker's novel.<br/><br/>Since the rentals were all out I went and got a copy at Target and have already watched it twice. This is almost mandatory unless you know what to expect. There are so many elements of previous monster films in the conglomeration that I'm not sure one would recognize them all in one pass. All that borrowing is just the point - when a movie so blatantly employs elements of other films, couldn't it just possibly be the director's intent? Get in this carriage and enjoy the ride. Sure there are a few cheezy moments, but even the humor is more palatable the second time around: Igor, with something akin to a cattle prod, shocks Velkan as a werewolf and Dracula queries ""Igor, why you torment the creature so?"" (as if Dracula would even care) to which Igor replies ""It's what I do.""<br/><br/>The borrowed elements are present from the very start: the riotous villagers and Samuel West's (who even favors Dr. Frankenstein in the original Karloff version) cry of ""It's alive!"" then the escaping Creation and a torched windmill mixed throughout the film with Shelley's idea of the character; the same poem from The Wolfman; all the traditional methods of retiring the monsters plus a few more; and a Dracula that like the Frankenstein monster is a blending of every portrayal from Lugosi through Cushing to Oldman.<br/><br/>Jackman and Beckinsale I'm sure were cast due to their respective work in X-Men and Underworld. I read that someone believed their talent was wasted. I'm not sure how acting could ever be wasted - accept on an unappreciate audience, and - as with the film - maybe they just wanted to have a little fun.<br/><br/>The twist on the film - Dracula's use of the monster - while possibly seeming inane, does address a subject that was just as inane in it's original conception: other than to tap the sensual aspect of the vampire for a reader or movie-goer, why would a lifeless, heartless, undead being without a soul even have wives to began with? And why would they have offspring when reproduction is a likely improbability and besides - they propagate themselves by spreading their condition via a chomp to the carotid.<br/><br/>The only real disappointment is the werewolf conversion and appearance. After Underworld, and the CGI of The Mummy(s) one would think they would have been better. Their appearance is almost stupid. Maybe again it was intended.<br/><br/>If you enjoy action films and know all the old classics, grab some popcorn and give this thing a spin. And unlike the prune juice-guzzling critics who forget about entertainment - enjoy yourself."

","How the director / writer conceived Kate Beckinsale's character so badly is curious enough. How she could have read the part and agreed to do it that much worse. What stuns the viewer, however, is the fact the entire crew from costume designer to camera operator could have collaborated! This could have been a great campy fun horror movie along the lines of a classic Hammer film (but with really great sfx) instead we groan when Kate Beckinsale first walks into a shot, suede high heels and all. Not that I am against a sexy character or two. The brides (especially Elena Anaya) are fantastic! So much so you forgive the fact their outfits appear to somehow be as impervious as their vampiric selves. <br/><br/>Despite a poor performance from Ms. Beckinsale I did enjoy this in an odd sort of way. The effects are so brilliant you wonder how movies like the Hulk still get made, the costumes (apart from the aforementioned Kate's) are cool in a ""I wanna be _____ for Halloween"" sorta way. The DVD extras are fun, particularly the bloopers real. The side characters all put in great performances, I want to say especially ... but they were ALL brilliant. Hugh Jackman IS a super hero, better cast here than as Wolverine though the comparisons were inevitable. Rent or buy the DVD and be happy you saved your $10 you would have spent seeing it in the cinema."

","Before I start I am going to state right now that I am biased towards the werewolf in this film. I love werewolves.<br/><br/>I watched this movie in theater and I will buy the DVD because of one character. The werewolves. In my honest opinion, I believe that this movie has the best looking werewolves I have ever seen. They are very close to how I envision them. It just goes to show that CGI is the way to go. I just wish for one thing to make the werewolf 100% complete. NEXT TIME PLEASE GIVE THE WEREWOLF A FRIGGIN TAIL! It makes no sense why the werewolf does not have a tail. Besides, aren't tails supposed to help maintain balance when they decide to run on all fours? Besides, the werewolves ""DID"" have digitigrades legs for a reason you know!<br/><br/>Oh BTW. For all of you CGI haters. I am sorry, but I am going to have to go pro CGI with this movie, for it is top-notch work. Can you imagine keeping the movie at the pace it was set at without the use of CGI?..... No. I didn't think so. <br/><br/>I also heard that some of you hated the transformation sequences between the vampire and the werewolf. Well just what in the hell were you looking for exactly? Something where each character takes five minutes to slowly transform from human into beast? Sorry, that doesn't work well in a fast paced action movie like this, because it doesn't keep up with the fast pace of the movie. Besides; let's say if I was in the movie and they were going through their transformation sequences, I could have waltzed in with a sword, chopped both of their heads off and walked out before they could even finish. So that is why their Transformation sequences were quick.<br/><br/>Please feel free to reply to this and challenge me if you want. I enjoy ranting about stuff like this. =)"

Besides the fact that I'd watch Hugh Jackman any day I thought he played an excellent Van Helsing. He's definitely got my attention, there is something intriguing about his character that gets you thinking. There were a couple of twists in the plot that I definitely didn't expect and Dracula is the most interesting of them all. The graphics were excellent and I loved that the movie didn't have unneeded nudity or icky romance. It's about time a movie had an interesting story line without these added annoyances.

However, I thought it was pretty good that they kept it simple with the shadows and the quick changes. Hugh Jackman, played a great hero and a great broodingly handsome one at that.

","I'm not sure why this film was made. In retrospect, I'm not sure why any movie gets made, but I'm particularly confused about this one. The cast was adequate, but this movie seems confused about whether it's a comedy, an action movie, or a horror movie. And this is the biggest problem with Van Helsing. If it could've chosen a genre to fall into, it might have worked. But it insists on being everything, and as a result, falls far short in it's attempt. The effects in Van Helsing(particularly the creature ones) are relatively well blended, but... well... not terribly impressive. With one exception(and I won't spoil which one... it's pretty obvious). The dialogue, while trying to be impressive and dramatic, is occasionally painful and forced. As a fan of many of the myths presented in Van Helsing, I found their treatment to be inadequate and disappointing.<br/><br/>Overall, I wasn't terribly disappointed. I'd already heard that the movie wasn't all that impressive, so I didn't have any expectations. If you're not a fan of the mythic or Gothic genres however, and you like lots of bright flashes on your TV, check this movie out. You'll probably like it. I sure didn't."

","The teaser footage for this Universal monster mash looked so promising you can only wonder how director Stephen Sommers dropped the brain so badly after his earlier successful transplant of new life into The Mummy.<br/><br/>Reuniting the staple horror film icons of Dracula, the Frankenstein monster and a wolfman a la House Of Dracula/House Of Frankenstein looked to be a sure-fire formula for 90 minutes of nostalgic, goofy fun but somewhere along the line it went the way of Baron Victor's lumbering creation and rose from its gurney a half-finished, bloated patchwork of iconic moments from other, better, movies.<br/><br/>The opening is a bravura homage/resurrection of the 1931 Frankenstein's climactic windmill immolation, shot in gloriously textured monochrome, but it's a potential which soon falters as clandestine Vatican monster-hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) catches up to an outsized Edward Hyde on top of Notre Dame in a direct steal from Alan Moore's The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen.<br/><br/>Thereafter, he's swiftly teamed up with a Q-like monk (David Wenham), gypsy princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale, emoting like a bodice-clad wardrobe and spouting the most hilarious eastern European accent since Star Trek's Chekov) and an arsenal of improbable weaponry (automatic crossbow, anyone?) and is sent to Transylvania to foil a scheme by Count Dracula (a staggeringly hammy Richard Roxburgh) and his three brides to steal the Frankenstein monster's energy to hatch out their offspring. Oh, and a wolfman pops up a lot.<br/><br/>Given the beautiful Gothic fairytale look of the film, it's overburdened at every turn by some unforgivably ropey computer animation until it looks as if Sommers is just hurling expensive spectacle at the screen for its own sake (a coach and horses leaping a yawning 50ft chasm, for crying out loud).<br/><br/>Jackman's a fine heroic lead but, like all these characters, is sketched in as a two-dimensional thumbnail with nothing to do but trudge grimly on until wooden stakes and the end credits save us all."

","I guess most things about this film already have been said, but... holy crap, it was so bad.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers' films just get worse and worse. They're all more or less bad, but for each film he's cranked up the stupid level a notch. Van Helsing is so devoid of plot and characterisation - and filled with cheesy CGI and dumb, dumb, dumb action scenes - that it will give you a headache.<br/><br/>Sommers obviously feels like a kid in a candy store when he can pick and choose from old monster films and make his own version of them. But why cannot anyone at least stop him from writing scripts? Try to convince him, bribe him, lock him up and throw away the key - but don't give him millions of dollars and complete control ever again! He may love these monsters, but he is torturing them (and the audience). He wants to be like Frankenstein and bring life to the monsters, but he is just one of the villagers trying to burn down the castle.<br/><br/>What's missing in Van Helsing is heart. Underneath the heavily animated, glossy surface, Van Helsing is as dead as Dracula. Do we get to know these characters? No. They're just puppets, controlled by Sommers, but ultimately still only inanimate objects, lost among computer animated sets and sceneries. They lack purpose, other than to stumble along into another fight, another plunge down an abyss, another pointless discussion. All accompanied by thunderstorms and heavy rain.<br/><br/>Sommers should be told that less IS more - as Hyde, Frankenstein, werewolves, vampires, and hapless heroes swing from yet another rope, chain, cable, or whatever is closest at hand. Everything that happens doesn't happen for a reason, other than that it leads to more maniacal mayhem. There is no logic to anything (Dracula can only be killed by a werewolf, so naturally he often uses them for his dirty work, but keeps the precious anti-dote in a container filled with acid inside a room - opened and locked from the outside - in his castle, which is accessed via a map, that's really a mirror, that's really a portal to another world).<br/><br/>When did actors suddenly become such a nuisance, that it's better to have them replaced by goofy looking cartoons every time they have to perform a more challenging task than uttering a line in a dodgy accent? Why must film studios defend bad films by saying that they're just supposed to be distracting fun, as if that would be an excuse for the lack of any quality whatsoever? How long will the audience put up with over-priced, over-hyped, and over-everything films?<br/><br/>Van Helsing isn't alive. It is very dead. Very dead. [0/10]"

The actors were, in my opinion, quite right for their respective roles, and the setting and background of the story could have made for a really nice thriller following up on the Dracula myth and tradition  it could have been taken to epic levels. It seems such a pity having all this at hand and then turning out only a slightly better than average movie  good on the action and spectacular effects, but little more.<br/><br/>What went wrong was that the action and effects were prioritised over and above the believability of the characters and story. Too much had to happen too fast with one spectacular scene after another. Instead they should have allowed for some more acting, defining and building up the characters and story. <br/><br/>In many scenes there is also an undertone of humour which I find quite annoying. When I watch a thriller I wish to be shocked, scared and thrilled, not having the suspense and atmosphere killed every other minute because the director, producers, finance men or whoever thinks it is oh so trendy for their movie to be like Buffy, Ally, etc. It's like having the dessert mixed into your nice steak dinner - I prefer to have them separately, thank you.<br/><br/>I rated this one a 6."

"feelinglistless","Null","0","1","29 August 2004"," Not enough tools
","Not having seen the Universal films referenced within except for in glimpses from other film and homage I came to Van Helsing without the main images from those films in my head ready to be destroyed. I still came away with a vague sense of disappointment, because for all the exciting set pieces, the deftly realized monsters and the weaving cinematography, the central characterisation and our way into this world is extraordinarily two dimensional and so much like the recent Underworld in moments when we are supposed to care so that the upcoming peril has greater meaning. By the end you want to care more for the overall storyline but you haven't been given enough tools or understanding for that to happen.<br/><br/>Perhaps we've been spoiled. The Joss Whedonverse has created an expectation that even the most extraordinary supernatural narrative can also include a mediation on some great theme and moments of heartbreak. This is also true of the film versions of The Lord of the Rings (which this film stylistically mirrors). But both of those allow the heroes time to breath -- whether its Buffy in a graveyard or Frodo on the road to Mordor, there are moments in which they literally sit down and talk about the impending doom. It also gives the viewer / audience a breather to think about that doom themselves. In Van Helsing that hardly happens, and when it does the dialogue is often of such plodding banality, first draft place holders rendered in celluloid, that its entirely up to the charisma of the actors to carry it off.<br/><br/>And so the dichotomy because for much of the time it is entertaining for that very reason. Hugh Jackman carries over the charisma of Wolverine (and characterisation -- this too is man without a past) and exhibits some of the vulnerability of an early Eighties Harrison Ford (although in places I kept picturing him in a Clint Eastwood bio-pic some day). That Kate Beckinsale can be the all action hero is just a matter of proving again her flexibility -- I thought her a bit wooden and uncomfortable in Underworld but here, even in that velvet corset, flashes of her romantic comedy persona come and go. David (Faramir) Wenham is also good fun in the typical sidekick exposition role working out what to do next when the increasingly convoluted (yet strangely repetitive plot) stalls. If there is a weak link its Richard Roxburgh -- not because he doesn't try his hardest but because this version of Dracula lacks a depth and he simply isn't given enough to do. In the moments when he could be at his most terrifying he's turned into a giant special effect.<br/><br/>Which is rather the overall problem with Stephen Sommers film. At key moments characters walk through an environment being stalked by some invisible evil -- the imagination runs wild trying to picture what kind of menace might befall the 'victim' and then it appears and time and again you're left with the impression of 'oh its a special effect' or sometimes 'oh its a great special effect' -- pulled out of the action the tension dissipating as the meanie jumps out of a window. Also a couple of the action sequences go on too long without ratcheting upwards -- and in one case a battle ends then begins again repeating everything much as it happened before in a slightly different order. But for all this, there are still enough entertaining moments to be worthwhile. Too many ideas then but not enough time given for talking about them."

","**Some Spoilers**<br/><br/>£5.80 that's a small fortune. There are several different things I could have spent this amount of money on, maybe a burger king meal, a paperback novel, a small amount of petrol, a large bag of jelly bellys, a fun fest in my local arcade or even some cotton wool to stuff in my mouth, eyes, ears and bum. All the above would have been more fun than Hugh Jackmans whack movie.<br/><br/>Van Helsing is about the famous vampire hunter and his efforts to beat up Dracula and his cronies. Jackman play the rough tough vampire hunter, Richard Roxburgh plays Count Dracula and Kate Beckinsale plays a pair of breasts also known as Anna Valerious the female sidekick of Van Helsing. Also to mix it up a bit is David Wenham of the Lord of the Rings fame as the Q of the catholic world, oh how the mighty have fallen<br/><br/>Basically the movie is about Jackman running off to Transylvania to kill off Dracula and save the world from all things undead. It's about two or three hundred years ago and old helsing is running around with laser guided crossbows and other ridiculous gadgets supplied by the lumbering monk David Wenham. When they get there it turns out Dracula's causing trouble, putting cats up trees and other minor offenses. On comes a battle with Dracula's three ladies at the night who attack in the afternoon. What results from this is a battle between Hugh Jackman and three goofy bat girls with big teeth. To make sure he takes these flying money-grabbers down to funky town he uses his ultra automatic crossbow which according to the manufacturers guide will 'Pin a donkey to a fence in seconds'. A ba-gillion bolts are sent shooting in every direction and before you can even say 'CGI-Fest' the fight is over. As the film goes on it turns out there is actually a reason for Frankensteins monster, wolfman and Dracula to be in one movie and it isn't a good one. So let me try to unfold this twisty and very stupid plot, Dracula needs Frankenbolts to somehow give life to his off-spring and wolfman is there to ermm, hmm I forgot. Anyway, Dracula wants to take over the world, yeah that's it! Take over the world<br/><br/>This film boosts a massive budget, the amount of money that funds a small countries civil war! $4000 billion dollars last I heard, and it amazes me how a studio can throw so much money in the direction of such a idiotic project. Even more reason to fear this movie as an entertaining item is the fact that it's directed by Stephen Sommers of the dire 'Mummy movie's'. Oh god, this movie was never gonna be good.<br/><br/>As I previously mentioned the film is a CGI fest, there are so many computer enhanced graphics in this movie that it's rumored that Jackman didn't move his arms during the shoot because it would have been more expensive and a cool fact to create CGI arms. Given the huge budget it would have been safe to assume that the CGI would at least be good to look at, but even this fails. The special effects range from pants to plain over-the-top, right up to Frankensteins neon head!<br/><br/>This movie just sucks, it's Hollywood crud super-sized! The budget to stupid, the plot is even stupider and it's so over the top and as unbelievable as Big Dave tidying his room. I generally hated this movie and found it too hard not to laugh out loud at the dire dialogue and silly effects. I spent most of my time in the cinema making jokes at the films expense and counting the sweets in my bag.<br/><br/>A classic example of Hollywood throwing stupid amounts of money into a crap summer blockbuster. No brains or good looks, this puppy doesn't have much going for it."
"CitizenCaine","5","0","1","4 September 2004"," Disappointing Summer Action
","One of the most hyped summer movies in recent memory, Van Helsing was supposed to become another franchise. A television series was purportedly in the works, and, with Stephen Sommers writing and directing it, what could go wrong? The film never made back its production costs at the box office. Hugh Jackman stars as Van Helsing, an Indiana Jones-like vampire (and all around monster) slayer. The film opens with a richly-detailed nod to Universal's original Frankenstein from 1931. The similarities end there however. Somehow I had the feeling that this film would rely on some of the original horror tenants of chills, scares, shocks, and pathos. There was little of any of the four. Instead, there was an Indiana Jones vampire slayer flying or hopping from one CGI sequence and one fantastic set decoration to another. Soon, Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious, played by British beauty Kate Beckinsale. She and her family have beefs with Dracula, played by Richard Roxburgh, and so she reluctantly joins forces with Van Helsing in order to vanquish Dracula. Dracula has plans to bring his ""children"" to life through some shady method or other. Roxburgh plays Dracula as more modern than the period portrayed with unintentionally funny dialog, and, at times, a poor Bela Lugosi imitation. Beckinsale is very appealing with her corset/goth look, but her character is underdeveloped, as are all the characters, and she seems to do little except be highlighted in isolated battles with the dark forces or be in trouble. David Wenham adds welcome comic relief as Carl the monk, Van Helsing's sidekick. Shuler Hensley is also appealing as a Frankenstein that seems to be more human than ones we've encountered in previous films. Elena Anaya and the other vampire brides add an R rated sensuality, which seems inappropriate at times to this PG-13 movie. The real star of the film is the art direction and set decoration, which was to be preserved in a television series until the idea was later scrapped. The problem with the film is its computer game look and pace, which do little for character and plot development. What was the Dr. Jekyll character doing in the film besides serving as an excuse for a ferocious CGI battle with Van Helsing? During some of the battles, it seemed like characters swung around with relative ease and too much reckless abandon that I thought I was watching stunt doubles instead of characters. The horse coach sequence, although exciting, was hopelessly phony at the key moment. We had Dracula, Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll, and the wolf man. The mummy, also made by Stephen Sommers, was conspicuously absent. The plot tying the monsters together was very unsatisfying. One horror legend would have been enough with a better story and richer characters. Roxburgh would not have been enough to carry the horror side alone, which explains why really none of the actors stood out. The parts were not written well to begin with. The ending also seemed out of place, as there was never much of a romance between Jackson and Beckinsale either. Still the film entertains in a hokey, non-thinking sort of way. The quick pace is necessary both because of the movie's running time and its lack of character/story content. It's a guilty pleasure to be sure. ** of 4 stars."

","I dunno what to think of this movie. Like, a lot of parts were amazingly kewl. Like the Wolfman. I mean come on, he's a goddamn wolf. What's not to like there. But there was no story to the movie. And LOTS of things were left unexplained. But not to be afraid, because you can be sure to expect 2 more Van Helsings in the future. That's 100% true too, no bullshit.<br/><br/>The story of VON Helsing, haha Von, goes as such:<br/><br/>During the late 19th century, famed monster hunter Dr. Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman) heads to Eastern Europe to battle with Count Dracula (Roxburgh), the Wolf Man (Kemp), and Frankenstein's Monster (Hensley). By his side is the ravishing Anna (Beckinsale), a member of a family committed to ridding the world of evil.<br/><br/>Yea that's all. Not much I know. It's basically an excuse to put the three greatest horror characters of all time in one movie. (Well 5 if you count Hellsing and Hyde). The effects are great. It's a good popcorn.

Hugh Jackman was suitably lickable and did get the majority of his kit off towards the end, thank god. The bird was grating and annoying, shock horror. The vampires were pretty neat. The effects were mostly very good in a computer animated coolness kind of way but occasionally stupid looking (usually where they were trying to do something fairly basic like making a character look as if they were jumping from horse to horse). The script was... um.... I don't think the script was really the point. They also did their very best to jam every other movie genre that ever existed into this one movie and the Wolverine references were... a bit silly.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the very beginning up until we got to Transylvania and Hugh Jackman getting his kit off."

Should this have been a movie about mechanical monsters and undead demons, unrelated to Frankenstein and Dracula, it would probably feel a lot better. This way, it just looks plain stupid - one more movie that tried and failed to change a common perspective on legends/historical events.<br/><br/>The script is so stupid that it is actually funny. If you are a trash-movie fan, do not miss Van Helsing, as it will put the smile right on your face. However, don't go to the cinema expecting a horror-action movie. Rather, this is a copy-paste compilation of scenes from James Bond and horror classics, tied in a mix of complete nonsense."

Oh and then of course, there is always the fact that Frankenstein has the power or whatever to bring Dracula's children to life- this is all becoming too much of a joke. There is also the genius of capturing sunlight in a ball, my god how many times have we seen that; it's so far from being an original trick that the last time I remember seeing it was in Buffy (TV).

","I really, really wanted to like this film.  I love Stephen Sommers' earlier work and the relative simplicity of complicated films.  He brings a fun, energetic approach as evidenced by the Mummy movies.  That was a formula that really worked with good performances by all involved, with comedy and suspense at the right moments.<br/><br/>Van Helsing was unfortunately a big, cheesy bore with painful one-line dialogue born from the Schwarzenegger school of screenwriting.  I gave it a 5/10 rating, but it only gets the 5 stars because of the amazing effects and cool creatures that have never been done before on film.  Bravo to the visual effects team, but that's about it.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>There were several plot holes in the film that I won't go into...plus the ""rules"" of the world created in the film were violated on several occasions. Example - in the very end Frankenstein is chained to the roof and one more lightning strike will set off the tragic chain of events.  All that's preventing him from getting off the lightning rod is one chain-link around his ankle.  But, he can't break the chain, despite being incredibly strong (as proven earlier in the film).  Yes, this is perhaps a stupid example for those die-hard VH vans, but it violates Screenwriting 101.  Set your rules and then live by them, otherwise the logic fails and the viewer doesn't believe in the tale.<br/><br/>Would I recommend seeing the film if you're looking for a visually entertaining movie with the surround-sound cranked up at home and you really like ""tent pole"" action films?  Absolutely.  Just don't set your hopes up for greatness and you should have a moderately enjoyable 2 hours.  If, however, you don't cringe at a dozen or so ridiculous moments and wonder why the film took that path or the actor spoke those sophomoric words...I'll either be really surprised or I'll glady wish you a happy 13th birthday.<br/><br/>ebhp"

","I was disappointed. The plot tried to incorporate too much, and wound up failing in all respects. They go out of there way to incorporate most monster mythologies, but they are skewed, and don't really fit together well. Much of the plot, and character motivations don't make sense. Kate Beckinsdale's accent is mildly ridiculous, and I don't think she really pulls it off believably. Hugh Jackman, as always, is a pleasure, both in performance and and as scenery! There are a few humorous moments, but they often seem forced. And the female vampires are so over the top, and to take away from the movie. There were points that I couldn't wait for the scene to be over, and the stupidity to end. In all, the effects, costumes, and scenes look fantastic, but it is not enough to compensate for a bad plot and an uninspired script."

","Not because this movie is scary in any amount, but because it is unwatchable.<br/><br/>I loved those old Universal monsters, they were classics. To see the memory of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney spit on with this over-hyped piece of celluloid trash was bad enough, but this film had not one thing going for it to make the effort worthwhile. I liked Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, when he showed some charisma, but his role here was completely dull and by-the-numbers standard action fare. Kate Beckinsdale's accent was so laughable. Even David Wenham, who I ADORED in Lord of the Rings and his indie Aussie films, was awful as a sniveling sidekick. I actually felt embarrassed for him. <br/><br/>Dracula was...ugh. Words cannot do it justice. The vampire brides were even worse. Where did they find those girls? A community theater? I thought vamps' fangs were for blood-sucking, not gnawing their way through scenery.<br/><br/>The storyline was so convoluted, I wished I could watch the pitch meeting for Van Helsing instead. ""So Dracula...needs electricity from Frankenstein to...bring about evil! Yeah, and there's the Wolfman, and Hyde, and...EXPLOSIONS and junk."" <br/><br/>I'm not a movie snob, and I enjoy summer action blockbusters (I loved Riddick, which didn't take itself as seriously as Van Helsing.) But this movie didn't even have good FX. Also lacking was an interesting hero and at least one memorable scene. What a waste. I haven't cringed so much in a theater since...Mission Impossible 2, I guess."
"Enchorde","6","0","1","23 August 2004"," Tries to do too much...
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **<br/><br/>Van Helsing, this is the story of a man fighting evil monsters around the world. A man that doesn't remember his past well (oh he remember that he is at least 1800 years old), a servant of the catholic church secret agency, is sent to Transylvania to aid and save a noble family's Valerious) right to enter heaven and kill the evil Dracula. Because an ancestor to the family has sworn no member of the family will enter heaven until Dracula is vanquished. Now only two siblings of the family remain, and the church don't want to fail this ally. Van Helsing arrives in Transylvania to find Draculas minions attacking the villagers and hunting the Valerious heirs.<br/><br/>So this is an homage to the monster movies of the old. Unfortunately this is not a very good movie. I think this movie tries to do so much that it fails it all. First and foremost, the central plot is not coherent. Well it is perfectly understandable why the Valerious hunt Dracula, but Dracula has no apparent reason to specifically hunt the Valerious. Sure, they might have been a bit annoying but no prophecy or anything will be fulfilled for Dracula by doing this. Furthermore the plot is extremely shallow. Now, this might be acceptable in an action movie that don't aspire to be more, but this movie keep hinting of a historical vendetta or some sort of coupling between Dracula and Van Helsing. This I find to be very interesting, and to find out the entire story is one of the main reasons to keep watching. Well, the main history, even if the movie tries in vain to keep it a secret, is ridiculously easy to figure out almost at the beginning. The disappointment comes when the movie tries to reveal this exciting piece of information and it is nothing more than what anyone that is barely conscious already knows. I think that you'll unfortunately discover this as well if you ever watch the movie.<br/><br/>Other things that annoyed me was why did Van Helsing use an automatic X-bow, when he can use shotguns, guns or Gatling guns, surely Q, oh did I say Q, I meant Carl, can and did give him some of those. Furthermore the movie confuses how to vanquish vampires and werewolves. As I understand it, werewolves can't stand silver and vampires kind of dislike wooden stakes through their hearts. Why Van Helsing has a silver stake is kind of questionable, to me at least. Additionally for me a totally new aspect of vampires was introduced. They lay eggs. I always thought that new vampires came from people being bitten by other vampires. Oh, finally concerning the story, the addition of Hyde and Franskenstein into the movie is completely unnecessary. They bring nothing to the story and could, should, have been completely cut. Must be that homage-thing.<br/><br/>The acting and editing is not awful but not very good either. I don't know if this is due to lack of interest from the actors or due to inferior material to work with. There are a lot of over-acting, especially Dracula has a long, completely pointless scene, where his over-acting his horrific.<br/><br/>What is good about the movie then. Four things come to mind. The scenery, with the village and woods, is nice. I did find the music good and the special effects in themselves is very good and finally the action parts is entertaining. But when other parts fail, this doesn't help much.<br/><br/>4/10"
"pyrocitor","6","0","1","13 August 2004"," This was Somers' fault
","It was obvious from the start that Van Helsing was never going to be Oscar material, but it was Stephen Somers' overconfidence in himself that caused it to tank.<br/><br/>Let's face it: Somers is no writer. After the mummy series, he has proved himself to be an inadequate director, (although I was quite disappointed with his attempt at directing Van Helsing) and talented enough at dealing with CGI, but when he tries to put pen to paper he just ends up hurting himself, and all others concerned. The script for Van Helsing was abominable - there were only a few lines in the entire movie that I considered well written, and they were all given to Carl. I wish some directors would just stick to what they're good at, which is directing, as opposed to trying to write as well - there are many skilled screenwriters out there, why try to put them out of a job?<br/><br/>Also, the editors seem to have fallen asleep at the wheel of this one, and the result is a head on collision. There is no sense of continuity at all in Van Helsing: it goes from having the mood of a tense action thriller to having the mood of a campy comedy. Nothing really seemed to fit together, as if they tore fragments from three different movies, mashed them together, stamped a title on it and shipped it to the theaters. I would love to know if production was rushed on this film, or if they had to move up the release date, because there are so many things that should have been changed that look like they were left in because there was no time to change them.<br/><br/>For example, the character of Frankenstein's monster was ridiculously portrayed, with a leg squirting out steam, and the top half of his head falling off to expose his glowing, sparking blue brain. The creature is barely able to walk, and yet he swings crazily on a rope from building to building. He howls out his lines like an opera singer, which I found quite funny when I looked up Shuler Hensley who played him, and found out that he is, in fact, a singer. Was this an intentional joke? I also found it amusing that Van Helsing, a supposedly serious 'monster hunter' kept referring to Frankenstein's creation as 'Frankenstein'. This character belonged in a comedy, not a movie that was attempting to be a serious thriller.<br/><br/>It's true that the plot is a ludicrous attempt to fit virtually every horror movie character into one story, but again, I believe that with a better director and a better script, it could have turned out passable. As it is, the movie is cringe worthy at parts, and unsatisfying for the rest. There's kind of a failed love plot between Valerious and Van Helsing, which is hinted at, but never really takes off, which gets really confusing.<br/><br/>As well, the movie relied much too heavily on CGI, which was definitely a downside. I'm fine with characters like the werewolf or the vampires in monster form being computer generated, but it seems most Hollywood producers have forgotten the virtues of makeup. There was absolutely no need for the vampires to form those ridiculously enormous fanged mouths when they bit their victims - a vampire bite is supposed to leave two tiny holes in the neck, not tear someone's head off! And Mr Hyde, one of my favorite Horror characters, was not only completely computer generated, but also turned into a gibbering baboon! WHY CAN'T MODERN Hollywood PRODUCERS DO HYDE JUSTICE?! In League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, he was transformed into an absurdly muscled stupid guy, and in Van Helsing, they've turned him into an ape. What they should have done, is had Robbie Coltrane play the part himself with some makeup on, instead of just providing his voice, and kept Hyde more as a real person rather than a green baboon, jumping off the walls and ceiling. That would have done a lot to keep the film more grounded.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been in Van Helsing. It was David Wenham as the belligerent friar Carl who really saved the movie, taking every Lord of the Rings fan by surprise by playing a character the polar opposite of his valiant Prince Faramir. The funny voiced, bumbling and ultimately very funny Carl was definitely the highlight of the movie. Hugh Jackman did what he could with the title role, (despite his fluctuating accent: I caught some American, British, Australian, Italian and Transylvanian throughout the film. Where was Van Helsing supposed to be from, and why couldn't he keep his accent steady? This is another thing a good director would have caught) but his part was so badly written that he had to battle to make the character believable. Richard Roxburgh was campy and very over-the-top as Dracula, but good fun nonetheless. If he had toned his seemingly relentless energy down, (and with a competent director, he probably would have) and focused more on being sly and cunning, I think he could have made an excellent Dracula. Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious was all right, but she and Jackman shared very little chemistry, and she was stuck with some of the worst lines in the movie, so it was hard to properly rate her performance. <br/><br/>Despite all my criticism, I actually enjoyed this movie. It accomplished what it wanted to be, which was an exciting action film where Van Helsing gets to go blow up a whole bunch of monsters. I just think it could have been done a whole lot better, if Somers had stayed far away from the project, which would have made it a lot more enjoyable. My rating of 6/10 isn't because the movie wasn't entertaining, but because I thought it was badly done, and could have been better.<br/><br/>-6/10"

However, this wasn't to be the one that would break that trend.<br/><br/>For many special effects driven sequences of the film I felt like I was watching a computer game, especially with the Mr Hyde character. This would have been fine if I was watching an animation feature film, but was not believable as real life action. <br/><br/>The acting was fine, as was the plot, but any plus points were completely undone at the end. I won't say what happens, only that it has to be the worst and most pathetic end to any film I've ever seen."

","I went to this film with hopes high knowing that I'd previously enjoyed the work of Stephen Sommers, Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxburgh.  I thought, ""We're in very good hands here...what could possibly go wrong?""<br/><br/>What indeed.<br/><br/>This movie, an exercise in Hollywood's current addiction to vulgar excess, is a mess from top to bottom.  It's chief flaws are in it's utterly dreadful script and the terrible, and I mean bloody AWFUL, performances by most of the cast.  From the opening sequence, shot as an homage to the horror films Universal Studios produced throughout the 1930's and 40's, the performances go so far over the top as to be almost unwatchable.  One of the key elements in making a successful horror fantasy is the audience has to be able to believe the world you're creating for them.  They have to have something recognizable as being true to life so they can accept the remaining fantastic elements at face value.  That something is usually found in the performances of the actors who, if they're good at their craft, know they have to make everything they're doing in this hokey environment utterly believable.    But I'm afraid Mr. Summers and company give us nothing to believe in here, from the overproduced design elements, including some impossibly anachronistic prop weapons for the hero, to the clunky dialogue, to the bad performances by most involved.  The worst, or wurst if you prefer, performance comes from the usually reliable Richard Roxburgh, whose portrayal of Dracula relies far too heavily on Gary Oldman's tantrum-throwing whiner of a count in the unfortunately titled ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (unfortunate because if you actually read the novel you realize Bram Stoker had very little to do with this version) and does nothing to sustain the mood established by Bela Lugosi or the power and menace created by Christopher Lee (still the screen's greatest Dracula).<br/><br/>Still, I try and find something positive to say about every film and in this case we have good news in the performance of Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein Monster.  He brings to the creature a sympathy that was very affecting, even though he was asked to perform under an outrageous amount of make-up (excessive once again).  His operatic background made him well suited to play the role with a truthfulness that was sorely lacking in most of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>What Mr. Sommers hoped to create was a continuation of the hybrid Horror-Comedy-Action film he started in ""The Mummy"" pictures.  In ""Van Helsing"" he made a Horror-Comedy-Action film the was neither frightening, funny, or exciting.  Instead it's a perfect example of Hollywood Summer Blockbuster filmmaking: runaway excess that is without an ounce of substance, or to quote Shakespeare, ""It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""  I hope these talented people will exercise better judgement and produce future work more worthy of their talents."

In Serendipity she was such a sweet girl, and here she looked like a baywatch babe wearing a corsette and 15 layers of makeup. The way she was doing that accent was horrible: i guess it's not her fault, it just doesn't suit her. In general, her persona would fit better for romantic flicks or even serious dramas, but not for a$$-kicking dominatrix type roles.

","First of all let me admit I am a big fan of the Universal classics from the 1930's - nobody can do Dracula like Bela Lugosi. And its not just the performance of one particular actor, its plot, characterization and atmosphere - genuine ""spookeyness"". Actually no modern horror movie has truly satisfied me except Bram Stoker's Dracula. Van Helsing was OK - I expected great. If they are going to MAKE a movie like this - go to all of the trouble, effort, money, why not make a GREAT one. (I say the same for Troy - good movie, should have been GREAT!) The Frankenstein monster was a nice touch, but he rest was too much window dressing - too much flash, too many things flying around. And some of the plot twists, the secret world behind the mirror and those squishy eggs left over from Alien.     Real horror movie cliche's are great, but not overworked things like mad chase scenes, squishy eggs complete with the same sound effects, things like that which work in one modern horror or science fiction movie but get old when worked to death in every horror or science fiction movie. Since seeing Van Helsing I have been watching Dark Shadows on video and after VH appreciate DS so much more. Now there is acting, plot, sets, mood, costume - ATMOSPHERE. Just goes to show you cannot beat a two hundred year old vampire discovered chained in a coffin tn the family tomb who authentically redoes the ancestral home and kidnaps a beautiful local girl to turn into his lost love."

","Don't get me wrong, I love a good action movie with lots of cool weapons, stunts and unexpected twists, but... ....this was another of these movies that should never have been made. It seems like I was watching a 2 hour trailer for an ego-shooter. All the authors of the original monster-literature (Frankenstein, Dracula, Dr. Jeckyl & Mr. Hyde, Werewolf, ... ) must be turning in their graves. The movie butchered them all for some cheap visual effects (and when I say cheap, I mean CHEAP). The computer graphics were thoroughly unconvincing - partially even worse than in 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. Plot and Character-development were next to non-existent. When the heroine dies there was not one tear in the house - nobody cared. The character was just developed that badly. The end fight was totally anti-climatic. The plot as illogical and contradictory as it can get (and I am not including monsters and vampire-hunters into 'illogical'). The stunts? Totally unbelievable (yeah... right, we fight in high heeled boots, jump all over the place and land after a 50 foot drop on our feet..uh huh). Jackman does his wolverine-shtick. Nothing new there. The comedic-sidekick didn't have one line  that wasn't totally lame. Who wrote this stuff?<br/><br/>Oh yeah, speaking of comedic sidekick. The movie was so full of cliches that it hurt. Right down to the hero and his pal riding off into the sunset. I would have almost blown chunks at that point. The 'story' seemed ripped from a book called 'how to write a movie plot in 5 minutes'. Boooooring.<br/><br/>What is there left to say? Normally when I don't like a movie I at least tell people to go watch it on DVD and make up their own mind.

","The star of this film, known to many of us, as CGG (Computer Generated Graphics) does well, despite its overuse and obvious animation. This is a rehash of many a horror film, and when one is retooling it for an updated modern version (as they will in the future for this popular genre), the screenwriters and director need to add an essential, original point that will make people stand up and take notice. VH has no such originality, nor zing. Hugh Jackman delivers such a wooden performance, one is terribly tempted to call Geppetto to see if he was missing one of his puppets. The chemistry between his character and Ms. Beckinsale's character is so poor; I was assuming he was gay. Not that there's anything wrong about that, and it would have been a cool and groundbreaking route to go with this venerated character of horror movie lore. Once again, I digress to hint of any originality which could spice up a deadly dull flick like this one. Kate Beckinsale does sparkle in her role, exuding sexuality and vim, which saved this writer from having to rate this whole escapade as a bomb/turkey/junk/pond water, etc. Also, Richard Roxburgh, who literally and figuratively chews upon the scenery like an Atkins diet drop out on a loaf of fresh baked pumpernickel. Richard had a good time with this role, and it shows, as his relish is strong. Aside from these, the film get stodgy, dull and CGC happy for most of its cruel, crushing 132 minutes. The Hyde character, conveniently borrowed from another turkey (League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen...*yawn*) doesn't perk up the production a flip. A lot more backfires than starts, in what should have been a fun romp around the macabre side. Instead, VAN HELSING tries to dazzle us with poor animation and script, as well. As I stopped yawning, pondering this picture, I regain the senses enough to type out the following words: NOT RECOMMENDED."

You have the wolfman angle, you have the vampire angle and you have the Frankenstein monster, why not add Creature from Black lagoon and some giant rats (Ben (1972)), so we can have some representation from all aspects of monsters. I was waiting at any time for an alien to walk out or for another monster to make a cameo.

Van Helsing is low-brow Hollywood flash at its worst; a lot of fancy CGI effects with the barest minimum attempt to give the characters any, well, 'character'.  Van Helsing himself reminded me of some room-temperature IQed Fabio wannabee who thought his looks would get him through any situation.<br/><br/>However, I must say I did like the new twist the director put on Frankenstein's character.  Instead of a lumbering, semi-aware goon that he's usually portrayed as, Van Helsing showed him to be a wise and highly intelligent creature with a quick mind and a sharp tongue (although somewhat grumpy and antisocial).  They should do a sequel with him as the star."

There's a secret rule of action movies that Sommers doesn't understand.

He is the Vampire hunter Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman).<br/><br/>After an encounter with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde he went for a mission in Transylvania with his side kick Carl (David Wenham) who makes him James Bond style weapons, of course made with that period technology.

That's it, that's the story - The Ultimate Spin-off of the century.<br/><br/>The only simplest thing that went wrong in this movie was the director, who failed to give any importance for the Story. Also the CGI which played an important part in this movie, looked OVERDONE. The iconic characters showcased as Cartoon like figures as we already seen in Mummy Returns (Rock as the Scorpion King), Matrix Reloaded (Neo fights with multiple Agents).<br/><br/>Background score is so weak that we will not remember the theme after an hour.<br/><br/>And the most disgraced thing in this movie was The Dracula, such a legendary role was ruined by actor Richard Roxburgh. His version of lethally Un-seductive, Russian slang Count Dracula was the worst Dracula ever seen in the Hollywood history.

","The plot is incoherent. The special effects/action scenes crowd out any possibility of real acting, yet are strangely and distractingly sub-par. To call the characters ""cardboard cutouts"" would be offensive to cardboard.<br/><br/>I don't usually say this about movies, because I appreciate that writing is not easy. But in this case, I'll say it: Even I could have written a better script. The mirror universe of the movie has no internal logic - virtually anything appears to be possible at any time - so there can be no dramatic tension. Plot points are revealed through awkward explanatory speeches, rather than by showing the audience how things are. That would be a serious weakness in any sort of script, but it's a huge mistake in an action movie, of all things. Without the slightest whiff of drama and without any audience involvement with the sketchy characters, the action that makes up the bulk of the movie is merely sound and fury, signifying nothing.<br/><br/>Not silly enough to be fun in the MST3000 sense, it was merely dull. As if to make up for the dullness, it's also long. I kept checking my watch, something I don't recall doing in the movies recently. I paid US$0.50 to see this movie, and I think it was about US$8 too much. Some have called this movie ""homage"" to monster movies of old.

The movie throws everything related to 19th Century horror novels against the wall in hopes that something will stick.  Most films now a days don't have enough plot but Van Helsing has too much. Battles with Dr. Jekyll, Dracula, Wolfman, Frankenstein's Monster and the immortal lab assistant Igor mostly complete the list.  Unfortunately there is zero emotional connection, not even reaching to the depths of Armageddon. This is a pure set design movie with bad CGI monsters; even given the efforts of Hugh and Kate.  What a lot of people don't realize is that Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are GOOD actors.  However the director, Stephen Sommers gave them nothing to work with.  Too bad, coulda been a contender.

","Movies like Blade and underworld opened the doors of vampires and werewolves to the big audience once again. Of course this means that there are vultures who want their share of the tasty and rich corpse. This could be a good thing, but in this case it's not. For example comparing Van Helsing to Blade the difference is that Blade is a good movie and comparing to the Underworld difference is that Underworld has credible filming. Sorry Van Helsing<br/><br/>Movie is about this radical monster hunter called Van Helsing. Actor Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing is just walking through the movie with basic routine. Nothing special is transferred to the screen. I miss the Wolverine attitude what Hugh gave in X-Men. <br/><br/>Movie's worst problem (after that annoying idiot sidekick who is forced to tag alone with Mr. Helsing) is that it tries too much to please everybody. Movie is bit of comedy, action, fantasy, `romance?' and horror. Combining all these factors make the movie only to be below average in every category. It can't be a good action film because it's too busy trying to be scary and so on.. Well the makers of the film have really wanted to invest their multi category story by giving the film over two hours duration. It's pretty rare to have such a long time in this kind of movie but it won't work. Movie is over long and after the first hour it starts repeating itself pretty much and starts to make you pretty bored and numb. <br/><br/>If you have to find something good out of the film I have to give a credit of the huge amount of effects they have use. In over two hour film there is not many scenes where CGI graphics aren't used. This is a good thing because so many times effect movies have effects only couple of minutes (the scenes what you see in trailer) and that's that. Rest of the movie is just dull conversation etc. But that's a difference in Van Helsing. Unfortunately the effects used in movie are only in average level, some are almost good and some are bad. But if you like watching effects there's plenty of that in this film. <br/><br/>At the end just to keep the movie review in balance and remind that we are talking about a bad movie here, I have to say that the gadgets and guns Helsing were using are too over sci-fi to be only cool or funny, they were embarrassing. Keep away from this one and eat some garlic just to make sure that it keeps away from you."

","**Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, I really did.  I watched the trailers and TV commercials thinking how cool this movie looks.  Unfortunately Van Helsing is marred by some glaring flaws that keep me from recommending it. <br/><br/>
This is not to say the movie is all bad.  The most obvious high points are the fight scenes.  My attention was definitely grabbed when Van Helsing started wailing on some vampires with his automated crossbow.  Also Hugh Jackman is pretty good (although not great) in this movie with his somewhat comedic dialogue.  Kate Beckinsale is also smokin hot in this movie, although you wonder about the practicality of fighting in high heels. <br/><br/>
My main beef with Van Helsing is with the monsters.  Particularly with Frankenstein, Dracula, and Dracula's wives.  The acting and dialogue spouted by these characters is bad.  I mean REALLY bad.  I cringe whenever they start talking, not because it's scary, but I'm afraid they might not stop yapping.  The CGI for some of the monsters, such as the Mr. Hyde monster, at times looks obviously fake.  Yeah I know they're fake to begin with, but I think an actor with some good monster make up would have been a better choice instead of computers.  Lastly, this movie relies too much on special effects instead of character development.  In a movie like Van Helsing you expect a lot of special effects to be used, but other movies (like the Spider-Man and X-Men movies) have shown that you can have great effects and great character development as well.<br/><br/>I would like to leave off by saying that Van Helsing was not a totally bad movie, but it does nothing to propel itself above just being an average one. However, if Van Helsing 2 ever comes out, I am willing to give it a chance, in the hopes they have corrected a least some of the mistakes from the first movie.  <br/><br/>I give Van Helsing a 6/10."

","This isn't a review as much as it is a part of a self-therapeutic process to get over a stinking experience.<br/><br/>Before I begin, I'd like to tell you about something that characterises this inflated project where far too much money have been involved. I noticed some advertisement for a writing competition connected to this film. It stated that you should submit a story containing certain words and among them was (I kid you not) ""Van Helsing the computer game"". After reading that, it was only by chance I came to see this film, as I walked by a free showing out in the open, no charge. <br/><br/>There is a certain type of film where you get the feeling that they cut down on working on the manuscript in order to beef up the special effects department. It usually has 'big' names fronting it, like Chuck Norris or Van Damme. Plot weaknesses are abundant and there is a clear tendency where every car crash ends with an explosion. <br/><br/>For a film on the supernatural set before the invention of the automobile, this sure do come close to that description. Lousy acting, a story so illogical it hurts even if you've switched your brain to ""sit back and enjoy the ride"" and a 'car chase' that ends with an explosion.<br/><br/>Some dosage of this might be forgivable if it is a shoe-string budget film made by a rookie and three of his or hers friends. This, in lack of better words, 'entity' contains digital artwork by WETA (Lord of the Rings), fabulous locations(among others a cathedral), made by an experienced director alongside actors that have been seen in cinemas before and costumes that Anne Rice would dream of putting on her characters. The sad thing is, it all feels wasted. A film that so much relies on special effects, doesn't even put them to good use.<br/><br/>Now I didn't expect high-quality acting or a great artwork made a by a great director. After all, Stephen Sommers did The Mummy Returns. I do expect to at some degree to find enjoyment. Seeing horrible versions of classic characters being torn to pieces (did they say ""Here's an idea: Let's combine Frankenstein's monster with Tarzan!"" in the planning stage?) on expensive sets in hopeless settings doesn't include in this. I had no expectations of excellence, but any hopes of mere mediocrity was blown away. Highlander and Universal Soldier are great series going strong in comparison. Considering that the original Dracula manages to be creepy by the mere use of shadows and make-up at a time when the director's title was 'herr doktor', then Van Helsing is an artistic failure.<br/><br/>I should say that I didn't watch the entire film. It being an outdoor showing on a plaza, I took time to go and buy myself a hot dog and some soda. I also arrived after it had begun, somewhere before Jack Hughman meets Kate Beckinsale. <br/><br/>Even for a free show, this felt disturbingly incompetent. This is from the guy who quite liked Underworld in some of it's moments; save yourself the trouble and do NOT watch this film. Valid alternatives include renting Highlander, taking a look at episodes of Narnia or go down to your video store, close your eyes and point at random. Both Willow and Ronja Røverdatter knocks Van Helsing down into his socks and those were made before CGI with main characters under 5 foots."

The previews made it appear as though it would a non-stop suspense/horror roller coaster ride, however it wasn't at all. <br/><br/>I'll make this as brief as I can by just getting to the point.  The first scene of the movie was the best more than assuredly, and when that scene ended I was excited hoping that the rest of the film would be just as terrific, unfortunately I was going to be let down.  And by the end of the first half hour, I was trying to read my watch in the dark wondering when this movie would finally end so that we could all be released from the pain and misery of such a horrible piece.  Obviously the writing was the worst part of it.  There was just no story to it.  It would have also been nice had Hugh Jackman had personality. When our hero first arrives at the beginning of the movie, I thought to myself, ""Oh yea, Hugh Jackman's in this.""  Which was fine, however it's not fine when you continually do this throughout the entire film.  Every time he spoke or made somewhat of a action that was more than drab, I reminded myself that not only was he actually in the movie, but he was also the start.  Not a good thing.<br/><br/>The directing was outstanding and it was some of the most incredible CG I've ever seen, but there were so many elements missing in the film and story. They never developed any of the characters, and the monsters just weren't scary enough I think for one main reason.  They didn't wait long enough in between ""scary moments"" to let you catch your breath and not expect to see them again, they just sort of kept showing up.<br/><br/>A couple more things to that I'd like to add to this, was it just me, or did Frankenstein's monster resemble Peter Boyle (see: 'Young Frankenstein')? And didn't Egor look like Ted Danson just a little too much?  Just a thought.<br/><br/>The girl was probably the best in the movie next to Egor, who I sort of had sympathy for, is that right, by the way?  But overall this movie really sucked in my opinion.  I paid 3 bucks to go see this, and in my opinion I overpaid by $2.75.  So, if you wanna see it go for it, if you're hoping for great special effects and a lot of bad dialogue and no story you're definitely in for a treat, otherwise don't bother.<br/><br/>I give it a 2.5 out of 10 and that's being kind."

","""Van Helsing"" Column A: There doesn't seem to be much of this going around so I'll try: there are a few things I think the film-maker's did well in the production. First off, if someone were to try and jam 90% of the most famous Gothic characters into one film AND attempt to create a coherent (if not anywhere near plausible) storyline around it - this isn't too shabby. Secondly, as an avid movie and television watcher, it is really hard to find anything that is genuinely surprising anymore, but I did find a few twists in the film that were completely original; namely, the clever integration between the Frankenstein subplot and the main Dracula one - a truly diabolical application of technology I must say. In addition, there are some very scary ideological underpinnings that sprout from the fictitious reinvention of the leading antagonist characters. It was a cool answer to the question, ""if Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein met, what would they talk about?"" In short, it was these two factors of surprise and clever integration of multiple themes that made the movie worth watching. <br/><br/>On the flip side, we have column B: What the film has in ideological plot ingenuity it lacks in its rampant efforts to ""make its mark"" in the action genre; Sylvester Stallone's Rambo and Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley define the persona's of Van Helsing and Anna, respectively. The characters are often shunted around as more staples of a different genre rather than key players in Gothic fiction. They're tired veterans and experienced soldiers, and as such, they are completely desensitized to the genuinely creepy, violent, and monstrous elements of their world. Some people accuse the movie of being over the top; rather, I think that the film is just missing some of the drama of watching all-too-human characters butt-heads in a conflict that creates an all-encompassing, paralyzing, bed-wetting fear. This Van Helsing is an icon, but nothing more. We watch in awe and amazement at the things he does, but forget him just as quickly after because his humanity (such as compassion and fear) has been shone away in a way that ours hasn't.<br/><br/>In general, this creates a strange paradox for potential viewers; the plot gracefully argues the shared Gothic core of the original fiction where emerging technology and magic question our beliefs about the nature of the divine, but presents it in a way that heralds the later action/sci-fi genre - using the magic and science as a plot device to deliver what boils down to a really big brawl. <br/><br/>My recommendation: if you're willing to look past the brawl because you love Gothic fiction, you will be heartily rewarded for the film's attenuation to the original spirit of the works; namely, the integrative treatments of Dr. Frankenstein's ""monster,"" and (to a lesser extent after the first reel) the origin tale of Dracula. If that doesn't matter to you and you just want to see a supernatural slug fest, then have no reservations about checking out the film - immediately. Drama in this film is few, far-between, but wholly rewarded when seen; even so, their are many surprising and genuinely fun moments that are worth watching for any audience."

These Hollywood monsters have been around seemingly since the advent of the motion picture, but I do not believe that any other picture has been this disappointing from the genre.

All this does nothing to make up for a terrible screenplay and mediocre direction by Stephen Sommers (of ""The Mummy"" series fame).

","Van Helsing is an example of the worst kind of Hollywood Popcorn movies; it's violent, no sex, filled with CGI effects and no plot (or too much plot that doesn't go anywhere). This very much reminds me of Underworld (also starring Kate Beckinsdale)- a pure set design piece. Van Helsing is a mysterious hunter of supernatural villains (all of the standard 19th Century English Monsters) working for Rome (the Church). After dispatching a very phony CGI villain in Paris he get sent to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula. I'm so disappointed. I adore the actors and the set design but the CGI is extremely fake and the plot might make sense to the MTV generation (as long as they are on a sugar-induced frenzy). Pointless violence is boring however lots to like but it's a missed opportunity. Don't spend your hard-earned money, wait for the DVD. Josie Maran as one of Dracula's wives is a real looker."

","Its over the top with some crazy fantasy put in to boot. Decent accent by Kate Beckinsale only, Hugh sounds a cross between Harrison Ford and Hugh Grant and his sidekick is a fleshed out C3PO.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers has had a memorable stab at the thirties classics, including the obvious and the Bride of Frankenstein, although the most detailed character is the monster, a little more wouldn't go amiss. The trouble with the film is the high octane action with no room to breathe, like Die Another Day. The character I was most looking forward to was the The Wolfman, whom has a confusing storyline that with the fighting against Van Helsing becomes the rest of the films main suspense. A sham, because the mood could have handled a rest, creating a nest errie surrounding. The ending is like a scene from King Kong, a similarity with the end of T2 and a bit of a Tarzan Lookalike in there as well. The musical score is not hitting the target particularly the horse carriage scene. Generally the plot strengthens during the film, but not to make is a great one to watch. Unfortunately the film adapted a pure action flick rather than a restrained thriller, which giving the potential atmosphere would have been a real bloodsucking treat."

"cloudcastle","6","0","1","13 June 2004"," Great show. Not a Movie Experience.
","I fell in love with the premise of this movie. For all you fantasy fans out there, it was taking an old cleric/scholar and turning him into a kick-butt paladin/assassin. The more I read the promos, the more I loved the idea.<br/><br/>Then I saw the movie.<br/><br/>I still appreciated the premise. The scripting was pretty good, minus two or three scenes. Great action movie. The overall movie experience was lacking.<br/><br/>Its special effects were its great strength and weakness. They spent so much money and time on getting the effects right, they seemed to skimp on the little things: choreography, accent coaches, wardrobe, music, lighting, set design. These are the things that make the movie an experience rather than just a show.<br/><br/>VAN HELSING & ANNA (Lead characters) The two main characters were very well done. I can't really complain much about them. They were well written, well acted, well directed, well wardrobed. . . I do wish they had given some character development as to why Anna was able to fight so well. But it was a long enough movie as it was, maybe they cut it out for time.<br/><br/>Dracula Richard Roxburgh did an excellent job in his execution of his script. But he could have made his speech about having no heart a little more than one-dimensional. Let's face it, in a movie like this, we appreciate a villain that has SOME redeeming quality. His interchange with Van Helsing was much more impressive. And he handled his death rather well. Excellent method of showing a vampire's healing abilities.<br/><br/>THE VAMPIRESSES (Dracula's brides) The vampiresses should have just been extras. Their action sequences were great. But every time they opened their mouths, I rolled my eyes and was just waiting for the next scene. They didn't really add anything to the plot or the movie except for their fights. I didn't even think they were sexy. Especially not in those campy outfits they had on. They looked like they were trying out for some psychic hotline ad.<br/><br/>CARL (""I'm not a monk. I'm just a friar"") This was a work of genius as far as character creation goes. They give you a great taste of what it would be like if James Bond had Q with him on his assignments as a sidekick. Although I feel it was a simple part for an actor, I have to give David Wendham credit for performing it well.<br/><br/>IGOR His line,""It's what I do"" pretty much sums it up. You can't have a movie like this without Igor. And he was doing exactly what we expected him to do. But someone was going to ask ""why is he doing that?"" So, they had Dracula ask for us. It's just what he does. Don't question it.<br/><br/>SET DESIGN Most of the scenes were very good. But I'd think the most important set would be inside Dracula's castle. And that is where the set designer really disappointed me. Maybe it was partially the lighting and camera work. Maybe other little factors. But the cobwebs were overdone and the entire set looked too plastic. The colors were just slightly off to make it look like it was faked. Again, if I'm there to just see an action movie, OK. But the promos made it seem like it was going to be a little deeper than that.<br/><br/>WARDROBE Van Helsing was well outfitted. As was Dracula. I could even say that the friar was done OK, but how can you go wrong with a plain brown robe? Everyone else looked really campy. Anna's wardrobe: designed well, poorly excecuted. It needed slightly different fabrics or colors that would project differently on the big screen.<br/><br/>SPECIAL EFFECTS The battle scenes with the vampiresses and even the baby vampires were good.<br/><br/>I never felt like I was suspending any disbelief. I just looked and felt I'd been transported. The transformation sequences were good for both Dracula and the werewolves. But when they had their final battle, they fell victim to the same problem that all heavily CG characters have. The speed and balance of the characters is always slightly off from reality. The only way I could console myself was that these were superhuman creatures able to violate some laws of physics in a fantasy movie. Even then, it was an effort to suspend my disbelief. Van Helsing's weapons were very well designed. Obviously not realistic for the era. But it was not too big a stretch for this genre of movie.<br/><br/>EXPERIENCE This is a quality of movies that I don't see much comment on. It takes into account things like flow of the movie, emotions not only portrayed by the actors, but absorbed by the audience, the feeling that you are actually in the scene.<br/><br/>For this quality, I'll have to give an 8 for a few scenes, but a 2 or 3 for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>SUMMARY If you're looking for an action movie that has someone being the superhero and kicking butt (Swarzennegger's --Commando) it's a great movie. They made some effort at being an intelligent movie as well, but only had limited success at executing that goal.<br/><br/>If you want a movie that made you feel like you want to hear more about these characters and this world you've just been introduced to (Lord of the Rings), this was OK, but not a great movie.<br/><br/>Cloud Castle"

","I found this film disappointing almost purely because it had some excellent elements that were crowded out in an attempt to pack too much into to smaller space. Firstly what was good about the film. The opening sequence was excellent and really grabbed my attention with a black and white recreation of the famous sequence involving a mob of Villagers burning down a windmill with Frankenstein's Monster in it, this sequence was excellently filmed although this may be due to the strength of the source material rather than the director. Secondly the actor Richard Roxbrough who played Dracula was fantastic and gave across a fantastic air of charming evilness with a particularly good speech about the heartrates of victims as he is about to dispatch them. The settings were also excellent with plenty of nice touches such as a semi built Eifel Tower in the Paris sequence. However the film was spoilt for me by the music which was an inappropriate trance type selection and by the seemingly obilgatory comedy side kick monk who added nothing whatever to the plot. Lastly Hugh Jackman seemed to be struggling to add anything to Van helsing which wasn't his fault as his character was utterly one dimensional. The film wasn't bad exactly and filled a dull Sunday afternoon but it had to much chaff nd didn't develop its strong points. In fact a series might have been better with Van Helsing encountering each Monster in turn."

","Dear God, I still can't believe this can be true(!) <br/><br/>I've recognized it at the first moment, the ""Vampire carnival"" scene is filmed entirely in the interior of the ancient and one of the holiest grounds in the old Europe, in the great St. Nicholas cathedral of Prague of Bohemia. They even removed the ancient benches. I feel really disgusted and say angry of what those ignorant cinematographers did.<br/><br/>This is and it was one of the most admired and one of the holiest grounds in the old ""Holy Roman Empire"" and the ""Kingdom of Bohemia"". This was the Church of choice (besides St.Peter's) for Emperors and Kings in the middle ages when the Prague was capital city of the Roman empire from the Baltic to Adriatic sea. This is master-piece-church of the Gothic/late baroque, made by the most skilful artists of Italy, Germany and Bohemia for God sake!<br/><br/>Church people said that they have no idea of what filmmakers will do in the inside. They ""rented"" the cathedral for some big money so the church people were happy for the ""donation"". My brother said that he saw a spot about it in our local television. I am surprised that the city is not suing producers for this.<br/><br/>So what now mr. Sommers ? Will you go to Vatican and use the Sixteen Chapel as your next playground ? Because the old town cathedral at the very heart of Europe is ready for a new dedication after this.<br/><br/>Another clear example of ignorance of American filmmakers is the scene where the ancient emperor's Charles IV bridge of Prague and the (obvious) city landscape of Prague is shown and ""the vampiress"" named the city Budapest (!). So the filmmakers now trade Prague for Budapest ? It's like show landscape of New York and say Moscow. Bohemia's Prague has nothing in common with Magiar's Budapest for God sake! It would be better if they use no names at all. <br/><br/>The CGI made castle scenes looked fabulous so why they decided to use those well known Prague sightseeing and renamed them.. ? It is odd, it's unoriginal and it feels horrible (at least for mid European).<br/><br/>I admire Sommers for his previous flicks, but he will be send to hell for what he did in Van Helsing.<br/><br/>:-)"

","Even though I love Universal's classic monster movies (as well as Hammer Films' versions, including Kronos, AKA Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter, I decided to chance Van Helsing. I mean, ""how bad could it be?"" Famous Last Words... <br/><br/>I did have reservations. For one thing, how could this new film manage putting (almost) all the classic Universal monsters into one movie? Even Universal had a hard time pulling that off -- in fiilms like House of Dracula, House of Frankenstein, et.al. The studio finally got it right when they added Abbott and Costello to the mix and turned the formula into a comedy. Would Van Helsing be a comedy? I wondered... <br/><br/>I held out hope that what little excitement I'd seen in teasers on TV would translate into grand scale entertainment, and that Van Helsing might not be a *great* movie, but might be a fun summertime distraction. WRONG. <br/><br/>All this movie offers is a ""video-game-on-steroids"" type of experience. This comes through on a number of levels, but one of the most obvious is demonstrated by the way the ""heroes"" leap and spin and tumble and jump and bounce and twirl and plummet and so on and so on...in ways so humanly impossible that after the first or second ""fight scene"" I was thinking, ""these vampire-fighting characters have no mortality whatsoever; they're invincible...they're BORING!"" Any potential thrill of seeing them put in situations of peril was quashed -- after all, you can't kill a cartoon character, and that's what these characters are: totally one-dimensional. The leads in Van Helsing are so ridiculously superhuman, in fact, that it becomes clear that they're never in any real danger no matter how ""scary"" or ""startling"" the imagery attempts to be. Even when mortality finally catches up with one of the characters it's not that upsetting. After all, this film is only a video game on steroids...<br/><br/>I am forced to compare it with Conan The Barbarian (arguably another comic-book hero film) or Superman: The Movie (wholly based on DC comics lore), either of which greatly surpass Van Helsing for having soul at the core of their productions. Van Helsing is hollow and gassy. It simply lacks heart.<br/><br/>The barrage of SFx is dizzying and because there is so much action with little time-out for recovery, the effect is mind-numbing. Wearying. Tedious. Cheap-shot moments with werewolves leaping at the viewer startle you to consciousness every so often, but otherwise the pace is monotonous. I found myself checking my watch more than once wondering when the ""ride"" would end. It felt like it was going around in circles at one point! The storyline (what little there is, and of emininent unimportance) is rattled off in quick handfuls of sentences by the main characters, so quickly that it's clear the film makers have little interest in the fantasy elements except if they can be employed to set up the next elaborate action sequence. The plot, as it is, is totally flushable anyway... This film plays not like a film but like a hugely overstyled video game. The camera follows the action the same way it might in a video game. The characters move from one level to the next as in a video game. The result is pretty ugly, obvious, and tiresome. Worse still, the monsters culled from Universal's prestigious history bear no resemblance whatsoever to the legends created by Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr., et. al. What was the point in Universal's making such a big deal about ""reviving"" these characters? I know, I know...marketing. Marketing (with a capital M). Well, this film is all about marketing. You can smell it like the stink of a rotting corpse even before you enter the cinema. It almost seems pointless to critique characters in such a one-dimensional production, but it must be said that Van Helsing the character rings hollow, and Hugh Jackman does little to elevate the cardboard hero any higher than absolutely necessary. Any number of talentless nitwits could have played the leads (or the monsters) in this film, and in some cases it seems nitwits were actually cast. No doubt the nerds out there who actually play video games all day long will feel this is a superhero they can sink their teeth into -- and even (dare I say) ""identify with"" <smirk>... The sad fact is, not even great performances by better actors could transform this film into something more than the slick marketing trash it is. SFx is certainly the REAL star of this show. But it's an overbearing star, continually bludgeoning you into senselessness with one daring set-piece piled on top of another. There's no time, if any, to recover from this, and the effect is numbing -- somewhat like the bloated feeling you get after eating too much. By the time the film is over you're simply grateful the roller-coaster has stopped long enough for you to get off. <br/><br/>I was grateful to see the current state of digital effects, which have come a long way in recent years -- and continue to astound. But in this case it was overkill. I was very impressed with a burning windmill in the beginning of the film, one moment I can still recall. There were a few other stand-out moments, but I can't remember those now because they were swept away in the flood of other effects and inane story development. <br/><br/>Just what a 13 year old boy might enjoy, one might say (and clearly this is the target audience since nipples have been left off the breasts of the female vampires). But the 13 year old boy inside me decided Van Helsing was junk. Just a slick marketing tool to get people to spend money at Universal Studios, or buy a dumb video game, or some action figures, etc. Because of this method of film making Van Helsing stands to make some money, but can't be considered much value for your buck."

Rub elbows is what the experience is like in a very literal sense of the word. Something about a premiere brings the weirdest talking cockroaches out of the woodwork and in addition to spying stars like Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale I also saw a few has-beens like Eric Roberts and David Heavener trying to sneak into the wings.<br/><br/>Perhaps the highlight of the event was bumping into Arnold Vosloo, who had been in Sommers' two MUMMY pictures and was hanging around for moral support. Arnold is a funny guy, and I quizzed him about how a few years earlier he'd talked to local sports guy Vic The Brick Jackobs and offered to remove the Mummy's curse off of LA so the Dodgers could win a few games. I guess Arnold is so cool because he hasn't reached Brad Pitt status yet and doesn't have a thousand dewy-eyed fans hanging around.<br/><br/>So what to say of VAN HELSING? Save your money and rent the original horror movies. This movie is busy, like the shower scene in PSYCHO being looped over and over and sped up to about 100 fps. It gave me a headache. Definitely not my kind of movie. Oh, but you were born after 1981 you might like it."

","How not to make film: 1. Inherit stable of well loved horror characters from Universal, each with their own fascinating (literary and cinematic) heritage and decide to throw them all into a film. Sounds promising....<br/><br/>2. Ditch virtually all the well established lore and tradition surrounding these characters in favour of stupid unsatisfying premise and threadbare plot. 3. Receive 200 million dollar budget and decide to spend *all* of it on special effects. 4. Ask video game designers to come up with a dozen or so set-piece action sequences(shooting vampires with repeat action crossbow, swinging from rope to rope, obligatory coach-and-horses 'driving section'). Base entire film around these. 5. Cobble together a ""story"" that attempts to fill in the occasional few minutes between these action scenes with some sort of coherent narrative. Fail. Badly. 6. Realize story is so bad that film is actually a comedy. Sprinkle disastrous hotch-potch of story with lame attempts at humorous one liners. 7. Add 'comedy sidekick' character in vain attempt to distract audience from gaping holes in plot. 8. Add Kate Beckinsale in tight black trousers for same reason. 9. Demand all actors speak in a ridiculous ""generic foreign accent"" for that 'school play' hammy feel. 10. Throw in a few references to other films (Bond, X Men) etc. in final desperate attempt to engage audience interest.<br/><br/>I genuinely feel sorry for the art designers on this film. They came up with some very impressive and visually stunning sets, only to see them employed in the service of a truly rubbish, rubbish story. Dracula had all the menace and charisma of an insurance salesman, and Van Helsing himself looked mostly bored. The only character with any semblance of interest was a sympathetic portrayal of Frankenstein's monster. <br/><br/>Stephen Sommers needs to watch a few decent films, and take notes on how they establish and build characters and construct a narrative (almost any Spielberg would prove very instructive). Spewing out a dumb action film for yeah-haaah simple-minded teens with no attention span is soiling the horror canon. <br/><br/>Please don't let this man direct or write anything else till he's at least mastered some of the basics of making a film, rather than ""some stuff that will look good in the trailer""."

","""It had great special effects."" That's about all i heard from any source before going to see this movie. Unfortunately, to a movie, that little five-letter phrase is like what ""Can't we just be friends?"" is to a relationship: A hint that nothing good is about to happen.<br/><br/>So i went to see it anyway? Of course i did. This movie HAD to be good. I'd been waiting for it to come out for nearly a year. Everything about the concept interested me. A sort of Vampire$ meets Blade. I was even thinking about how pitifully the upcoming Blade 3 would pale in comparison to Van Helsing. I haven't been that naive since the 3rd time i said ""I do.""<br/><br/>You probably want me to elaborate on what was so bad about it. I wish i could nail it down to any one thing. But i can't quite put my finger on it.<br/><br/>I'll start with the convoluted plot. James Bond, er, i mean Van Helsing, an agent of MI-6, er, i mean a secret religious security/intelligence agency under the auspices of the churches of multiple religious faiths, is sent (accompanied by Q, er, i mean Carl, the weapons/gadgets expert from MI-6, er, I mean...oh forget it!) to find/aid the last remaining descendants of a family that has been battling Count Dracula for several centuries. Why the sudden urgency? Because the family pledged long ago never to set foot in heaven until the Count has been defeated. Should the last of the family fall, their souls and those of all their ancestors will be forever in limbo between heaven and purgatory. There's an equally convoluted sub-plot/co-plot involving the Dracula family that i won't bother going into as there's no easy way to do it without going spoilers.<br/><br/>The actors/actresses all seemed about as interested in being in this movie as i felt in watching it. Jackman, Beckinsale and Roxburgh, all of whom I've loved in multiple other roles, gave performances worthy of only the most mediocre of after-school-specials. Granted, the movie was so fast-paced that there wasn't much room for petty little things like feeling, or character development, i still couldn't help but imagine as i sat there, how much better the movie might have been if it had been performed as a school play by one of my 2nd wife's kindergarten classes<br/><br/>I hope the writers/producers of this masterpiece are already in a back room somewhere shredding documents and deleting e-mails, because just like in the Enron incident, they've got some 'splaining to do. They're going to have to explain to someone eventually why this movie was made in the first place, much less released in theaters."

","""Van Helsing"", the first ""guaranteed blockbuster smash"" of the manic summer movie season, amounts to the most frivolous abuses of CGI lacking any intelligence or even plot. Starts out somewhat intriguing, broaches the vampire hunter with some style and, well the rest of the movie is simply ruthless, brainless, and frivolous to the extent of disturbance. Generally, a film which boasts fantastic CGI can succeed IF it is reasonable and enjoyable enough for the audience to believe and enjoy its ""popcorn rollercoaster"". Yet, every once in a style, the likes of ""Van Helsing"" arrives, with ample anticipation and, it sincerely disappoints us in its desecrating foolishness, and we are merely lulled to sleep rather than intoxicated by its exhilaration and mindless fun. The creatures conquered by the vampire hunter whose name ""they all know"" are nothing short of ridiculous, silly plot contrivances to excuse the film's lack of innovation for better ideas. And this film could have greatly succeeded, if only handled on the right note, and not on the silliness of vampires, bats, and frankenstein creatures, none of which are either convincing nor exhilarating. Heart pounding music and impressive CGI, yet scarcely in the right places. Even the summer movie season should promise us more than ""Van Helsing"". ** out of ****"

Fair enough: the initial scenes are fun, especially the fight with Mr Hyde and the first attack of Dracula's brides. BUT THE FILM JUST GETS SILLIER. By the time we've been introduced to other-dimensional mirror doorways and a vampire reproductive cycle that seems to be more like an alien pod-laying idea stolen from a Science Fiction move, this film becomes just too preposterous! If the baby vampires had been better designed they could've (slightly) saved this film. As it is, they resemble silly, cartoonish bat-things straight out of a Scooby Doo cartoon. When the first batch attack the village they don't seem nasty enough to the THE BIG THREAT that they're meant to be. IF these critters had actually looked like creepy flying baby vampires they might've worked (but I think that makers of this film wimped out of that idea because they considered the sight of exploding human-looking baby vampires to be too horrible.) The sequence where a vast chamber of hanging cocoons is filled with electricity looks like some out-take from a sub-par Matrix film.

Apart from some of the character names, ""Van Helsing"" has absolutely nothing to do with the original books, or those old movies (although they are cleverly referenced at the start).<br/><br/>In contrast to ""Dracula""'s Abraham Van Helsing, an elderly professor, here we have Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), kind of a cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond on a mission to rid the world of evil monsters.

And it certainly would be one, if there weren't so many brutal scenes at all. The director mixed-up information about all kinds of creatures: vampires, werewolfs, frankenstein's monster, Dracula, jekyll & hyde  in the end, vampires are even killed by silver pegs, which are originally invented to kill werewolfs. <br/><br/>Everytime monster-killer Val Helsing starts off to fulfil his orders, a whizz-kid provides him with the latest stuff to properly kill any evil creatures (like the supplier in James Bond films before every big task). This time Van Helsing leaves to get rid off the big boss' Dracula. Young amazon-lady Anna living in Transilvania carries out her duty to help him. There are a few problems like the people in town who were accomplished to being surrounded by vampires and not willing to support chaos, Frankenstein's monster being the target of Dracula due to the formula of endless life and Anna's brother mutating to a werewolf. But whatever may come into the way of Van Helsing seems to be no real problem, he simply rips it off. <br/><br/>I rated it 3/10, because of the great surroundings and atmosphere in the film. This is really something mentionable: the special effects are quite good (but not well integrated into the film at all, unlike in the film Alien e.g.), the places and localities are somewhat interesting.

","Apologies from the start for any comparisons with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but there are a couple of ""extraordinary"" coincidences. Firstly, both deal with victorian Gothic horror. Where as TLG started as a clever book that was dumbed down for film, Van Helsing from the opening scenes promised to be nothing more than ""Top Trumps"" of horror movies (for the under 20's, ""Top Trumps"" is the same idea as pokemon"") that dealt intelligently with the same characters. Secondly, Mr Hyde was remarkably similar in both films.<br/><br/>Despite the prospect of Van Helsing wiping out every monster of film history, it failed to deliver. Don't get me wrong, practically every monster was in it... just not a lot happened. Frankenstein's monster was for want of a better word, crap. Van Helsing's monk (sorry Fry), reprised the role of Q from James Bond fame, mixed with Pete Prostlewaites' role in Dragon Heart. In other words ""comedy"" relief in a semaphored style. I found myself surprisingly bored through various sections of the movie. Had the movie gone for die hard 3 thrills, it would have been perfect, but too often, it tried to explain it's lack of plot - and failed.<br/><br/>After the first five minutes all originality is used up, and if like me, you have read all the books concerned, part of your brain will be correcting the story throughout the rest of the film - because no-one else has.<br/><br/>Shame really.

Universal Pictures has a stock of classic monsters, and have brought them together for one adventure by re-inventing Dracula's nemesis Van Helsing as a sort of 19th century ghost buster. This project must have been doomed from script stage, though, because that's when Universal handed everything over to writer/director Stephen Sommers, the genius behind those two silly MUMMY re-makes. Sommers rapes and plunders great monster movies, making Dracula, Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster unrecognizable CGI Hulks, with no regard to their actual ""history"" or ""legend"" as characters.

","Other titles for this film could include Van Hellsing and the Search for the Holy Pail or perhaps The Van Hellsing Horror Picture Show. It was terrible, but in its atrocities it was wonderful! I must say it is one of the finest comedies out there to date. The dilemma of course comes in the fact that it is meant to be an action-adventure / horror movie. <br/><br/> From the opening scenes I was expecting a few things. A> A cameo by Mel Brooks, B> A cheesy song and dance number ala Monty Python or Moulin Rouge, C> Someone to do the 'alas' position with their left hand stapled to forehead, and/or lastly D> A man driving a Lexus across the country side beaming, safe and secure due to the fine engineering of his car and the anti lock breaks with somehow make him unconcerned about the mob of villagers or debris from an exploding windmill. <br/><br/>The acting was terrible. I would expect the same level of melodrama from a high school drama club, a bunch of goth wannabes, or a poorly designed White Wolf LARP. The main character of Van Hellsing played by Mr. Hugh Jackman was more of akin to a little kid pretending to be Batman then anything else. The lead chick, played by Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity and Much Ado About Nothing) whose character's name I've forgotten, but whose corset enhanced breasts and leather tight costume will remain in my memory happily, was equally unsatisfying except on the eyes and the fact that unlike most bad ass chicks in movies, she actually would hurt herself doing stunts as someone dressed like her would if they tired to do flips all over the place.<br/><br/>Dracula, played by the same man that was 'The Duke' in Moulin Rouge, was the most uncharismatic, cheesy-monkeyish, fruity, and untalented excuse for a vampire I've EVER seen. At least Leslie Nielsen was supposed to be funny. This Dracula was supposed to be scary I think but believe me when I say between him and his brides I was getting cramps from laughing so hard. His brides were acting like 13 year old pop star fans with breast implants I kept expecting them to ask to go to the mall. This one scene where our man Vald was reminding them that he had no heart and could not love was PLEADING for a musical number complete with fountains and dancing girls ala Los Vegas. <br/><br/>Well what about the other villains? CGI was their friend. The entire movie was most likely done on photo shop. Mr. Hyde was a Wolverine wannabe crossed with the Hulk/Beast and just plain silly. The Wolfman was alright, in a Vampire Hunter D sort of way. Frankenstein's monster was a total fruity goth kitten that I'd expect to see at the Castle, complete with the 'Alas my poor soul, I just want to live' occasional head toss, which on hulking beast charged with electricity does not invoke sympathy, but is so funny you want to slap yourself until you're babbling about jade monkeys at midnight.<br/><br/>Overall, the MVP of the movie was hands down the one intended to be comic relief of the film. David Wanham (Audrey from Moulin Rouge and Faramir from Lord of the Rings) had the best lines and was the character I think audiences will most identify with. At points, he was ACTUALLY ACTING! As the comical Friar Carl he was one part Q (from James Bond), one part Friar Tuck, and all parts amusing. By far my personal favorite character in the entire flick. <br/><br/>And what was up with all the Absinth in the windmill? Was it another reference to Moulin Rouge or maybe just a nod to the beverage of choice by the writers who came up with the cliché dialogue. Though to be honest, at several point of the film I was longing for a little bit of the 'green fairy' myself, as it might have made some of the scenes even MORE amusing.<br/><br/>So as the Python boys like to say, always look on the bright side of life (were you expecting the Spanish Inquisition?). The movie's redeeming qualities other then in Wanham's performance was in the cinematography, use of light and color, and scenery. Very nicely done! Visually the movie was great. From stunts to sets the movie was very eye catching. More over, for a hormone charged public every one had at least one piece of eye candy.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was the bastard gang bang love child of a deranged 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (complete with Oompa Loompa minion), a less cool Vampire Hunter D, and 'Dracula Dead and Loving It' maybe sprinkled with 'Jesus Christ Vampire Slayer'. In conclusion, I must admit I enjoyed myself because I was expecting a crap movie and got one. I didn't have to focus on how horrible the movie was but instead could laugh so hard my sides were hurting. This will be a movie I will be purchasing, if only for a good laugh now and then."
"Ms_Q","5","0","1","29 May 2004"," Disjointed, uneven (SPOILERS)
","Well, it's certainly not as bad as it could be (the trailer for 'Soul Plane' convinced me of that), but it's not as good as it could be, either. The problem seems to be that the director had no idea other than to put all of these monsters together in one movie. Once he'd achieved that, he didn't seem to much care about the rest of the movie, which served primarily as a means of transitioning from one action scene to another. He never made up his mind whether he was creating a serious monster movie, a monster movie with humorous overtones, a parody of monster movies, or an homage to monster movies, or some combination of the above.<br/><br/>The product is disjointed, uneven, unrealized. The soundtrack was relentless, bombastic, and relentlessly derivative. The monsters are so overblown and unrealistic that they lose any power to frighten; they are clearly the creation of mad hackers, not mad scientists. They are incarnations of bits and bytes, not incarnations of evil. The movie lacks any real suspense; we don't much care whether CGI characters disappear from the Matrix  I mean, the movie, and every other 'plot twist' is telegraphed two weeks in advance. Was anyone surprised to discover what or who the 'Left Hand of God' was? Or that Anna did see her brother again?<br/><br/>The script provides opportunities for humor, but none are realized due to poor timing and delivery. The biggest laughs came in response to what were evidently intended to be pathos-laden scenes, but were pathetic in a different meaning of the term. The human characters are as flat and two-dimensional as the digital characters. The blame for this lies with the director and the writers, not the actors. They did what they could with what they were given, but it is clear that the director's real concern was with the virtual characters. <br/><br/>Exposition is not character development. All we know about the characters is what we are told. Van Helsing never convinced me that he was the scourge of evil; he seemed more like a nice guy caught in the wrong movie and trying to make the best of the situation. He kills monster as a means to self-realization? That New Age psychobabble doesn't even make sense today, let alone in the 19th century. Is he supposed to be a dark, brooding figure, or one with his tongue firmly in his cheek? If the second, his tongue keeps slipping, as does his accent. I heard American, English, and Australian, often in the same sentence. Or was that an obtuse reference to his being a citizen of the world? Others have remarked on the similarities to Hugh Jackman's other franchise character, Wolverine. Suffice it to say that midway through the movie, we were referring to him as 'Logan Van Helsing.' Except that Logan, a true cartoon character, displays a deeper level of angst and human suffering that Van Helsing. We laughed when the werewolf howled.<br/><br/>Anna Valerious looks like Wonder Woman by way of Transylvania. There is as much chemistry between Van Helsing and Anna as would be expected between a human and a cartoon character, as well. Unfortunately, her redemption scene elicited giggles and whispers of 'Simba,' rather than sniffles and tears. Well, at least she finally gets to see the sea. <br/><br/>Dracula began with a bang and ended with a whimper. The character was wonderfully campily evil to start, but lost all control of his accent and his sense of proportion mid-way through the movie. Apparently his 'I am hollow speech' was supposed to be pitiful; it was merely embarrassing. Matthew Arnold and T.S. Eliot said it better, and so did Darth Vadar. 'Come to the dark side' is much more evocative than 'Join me. We can be partners.' One is an invitation to become one with evil; the other to open a fast food franchise. However, we suspect that it was merely a trick for Nine-Fingered Vladislaus to get his preciousssss  I mean, his ring  back from that thief he hates forever.<br/><br/>Plot holes are legion, but a few will suffice. Dracula cannot be killed with a stake through the heart, only by a werewolf; holy water, crosses, and necklaces of garlic also have no effect. Why not? No explanation is given for this violation of hundreds of years of folklore, legend, myth, and tradition. People have lived in a village that has been attacked by vampires for 400 years, and it's never occurred to a soul to upstakes and seek a new life in a new world? And the Knights of the Holy Order wait until there are only two Valeriouses (or should that be Valeri?) left before they lend a hand? That's what I call management by exception. Finally, Van Helsing can remember fighting the Romans at Masada, but he's doesn't look a day over 35. In a different movie, we could put that down to his regenerative abilities; in this one, it has 'prequel' written all over it."

"dgeer80","6","0","1","25 May 2004"," A fun ride, but flawed.
","Let me first say that I'm a huge fan of the old 1930's and 40's Universal monsters. My dad, who grew up on those films, introduced them to me when I was pretty young. Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster, and Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man were some of my favorites (along with the Invisible Man and The Mummy).<br/><br/>So when I heard about Van Helsing, and saw the previews, I was excited. I knew Steve Sommers loved those old movies. And judging from what we got with his ""Mummy"" flicks a few years back, I was expecting Van Helsing to be the same kind of film: An updated version of old monsters with a roller-coaster ride plot. Well that's what we got, but it wasn't as good as Sommer's Mummy films.<br/><br/><br/><br/>First of all, their were some plot problems. There's a scene where Van Helsing's horse carriage with six horses pulling it along jumps a broken bridge over a huge ravine that they never would've made it over if actual laws of gravity were applied. It almost looked like the horses were flying like Santa's reindeer. It reminded me of when the bus jumped an incomplete highway in ""Speed."" Never would happen. OK, the carriage didn't quite make it over. It crashed onto the edge of the other side of the ravine. But neither the horses nor Van Helsing should've made it across. Not only that, but they were a decoy, so ANOTHER six horse carriage was behind them carrying the passengers they were trying to save, while Van Helsing was actually a diversion for possible vampires on the road. So they must have ALSO jumped the same impossible jump as Van Helsing did! And their carriage DID make it! Either that, or there was another complete bridge somewhere else. But even then, the timing would be near impossible for the real carriage to end up pretty much right behind Van Helsing's carriage to help him out.<br/><br/>Second, Van Helsing gets bitten by a the Wolf Man, thus he has to become a werewolf himself during the next full moon at midnight. OK cool. However, a plot point that's never really established well is that supposedly the only way to kill Dracula (not vampires in general, but just Dracula) is by a werewolf killing him. This is something new in Vampire lore, since usually Dracula (as well as any other vampire) could be killed by driving a steak through his heart and chopping his head off, or by burning his coffin. So since in this movie it's established that the only way is by a werewolf, they need to tell us WHY. Whenever introducing a new plot point, it must be defined. If it was the usual steak through the heart thing, I'd buy it since that's been in Vampire lore forever. But alas, this is not the case. I can buy that Dracula has to be killed a different way than other vampires because he's the most powerful of them all. He gave his soul directly to the devil to make himself a vampire, whereas all others are just turned into one by being bitten by another vampire. But giving no explanation for a new method of killing him was a mistake.<br/><br/>Another minor flaw was that when Dracula confronts Van Helsing for a duel, it conveniently turns midnight and the full moon comes into view. It would be fine if we were given more of a countdown during scenes. But the way the movie portrays it, it's by happy chance that it conveniently turns midnight just as Dracula confronts Van Helsing for a duel.<br/><br/>Lastly, the CGI. Now, I'm a firm supporter of CGI, and I think it's a great tool. So it really takes a lot for me to actually criticize it. Steven Sommers tends to use CGI in unnecessary places. And in this movie, not only does he do that, but the CGI itself is rendered poorly. The Mr. Hyde character at the beginning suffered from what the ""Hulk"" suffered from as a CGI character. It just looked fake and cartoony. I hate saying that, because a lot of CGI in films like Lord of the Rings, the Jurassic Park series and the Star Wars films look great and are very convincing. But in ""Van Helsing,"" the Mr. Hyde character just didn't look real. His character was done better in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (which I thought was cool), because they used actual prosthetics and just blue screened him onto the frames with other characters to make him look huge. Much more convincing. This is the way he should've been done for Van Helsing. CGI should only be used when there's no other convincing way to do the effect one is trying to achieve. And if it's used, it should be given the same care that was given to Gollum in LOTR, the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, or the CGI aliens in the Star Wars films. Those creatures and effects were convincing. Hyde was not.<br/><br/>Well, enough of the flaws. This movie was fun. The overall plot was cool. David Wenham's friar character was great comic relief. The CGI for the Wolf Man and the vampire effects was done pretty well. The atmosphere was very dark and moody. The Frankenstein monster was done right. He was the best character in the film. Thankfully, his character was created with prosthetic make-up. If he was done in CGI and only given the amount of care that was given to Mr. Hyde, he would've suffered the same fate of looking fake. Dracula's character was cool. I loved how him and his brides walked on the walls and the ceilings. He even had the romanian accent, which was a nice touch. I also like the ballroom scene. It's filled with people, and we see Dracula dancing with Anna Valerious amidst the crowd. There's a big mirror they look into while dancing, and she's the only one visible. Suddenly we realize that the room is filled with vampires since no one else casts a reflection! That was a nice touch. Lastly, I loved the opening scene with Dr. Frankenstein screaming ""It's alive, ALIVE!"" That scene was filmed in black and white, and it even had the monster rushing up into a windmill with angry villagers with torches burning it down just like the old classics!<br/><br/>So overall, I give this film a 6 out of 10. It was fun, but definitely flawed."
"ianrees","Null","0","1","25 May 2004"," Little over cheesy
","Spoiler!! Hmm..i didn't have the highest expectations but it wasn't too bad. The effects were fantastic and the film itself was very well-made, detailed props, fantastic sets and really good effects. The characters weren't particularly appealing though. If it hadn't been for the sweet little friar the characters would be completely lost in the larger than life special effects. The chemistry between Van helsing and Anna was pretty much non-existence and so the kiss was a complete surprise to be honest! And you didn't get involved enough with them to really care when she died.<br/><br/>The script was humorous in parts but fantastically over-cheesy (""I have never been to the sea..but i bet it is beautiful"") and a little over dramatic at times. There were quite a few moments that made me jump, but nothing really sustained scary-wise. So, well-made film graphologically but with an over dramatic story, cheesy script and undeveloped characters it wasn't the greatest film ever made."
"Victor Field","Null","0","1","30 May 2004"," We want the finest vampire slayer known to humanity. And we want her here. And we want her now.
","One early scene in ""Van Helsing"" plays like a cross between ""Men in Black"" and the bit in James Bond movies when Q shows Bond his newest gadgets. Writer-director Stephen Sommers doesn't, however, include anything reminiscent of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" which is just as well - Buffy's run-in with Dracula was infinitely superior to this overblown, underpowered mess. Sommers chucks in Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, the Vatican, and endless rewritings of lore but forgets to make any of it interesting, starting with his characters.<br/><br/>There's some kind of backstory about our fearless vampire killer, but it doesn't really build him up, and not only do we have a weak hero (played with a surprising lack of charisma by Hugh Jackman) but we also have a dull villain in Richard Roxburgh's Dracula; it's all one great big who-cares, a very hollow centre around which all the action revolves. Sommers certainly keeps the action coming, from a Paris showdown between Van Helsing and Mr. Hyde onwards - this whole movie plays like a piece of poorly done fan fiction (which in a way it is) - but without any emotional investment it's all for naught, and despite vampire attacks, all-out fights, and endless special effects it's pretty boring. And not only boring, but stupid (suspension of disbelief is one thing, but when six horses safely leap over a chasm while pulling a coach...).<br/><br/>To make matters worse, it's done with a surprising lack of humour, Dracula's brides overact annoyingly (the loveliness of Josie Maran, Silvia Colluca and Elena Anaya notwithstanding) and there's something wrong when Van Helsing has more chemistry with Frankenstein's monster than with a dishy Transylvanian princess with a nice line in tight trousers and monster-killing. On the upside, Kevin J. O'Connor and Shuler Hensley are good as Igor and the monster, and Kate Beckinsale is lively when the script gives her the chance (and sexy even when the script doesn't); some of the FX from Industrial Light and Magic, Greg Cannom, Captive Audience, WETA Digital and the army of others are very good, and Alan Silvestri's score is too good for the movie it was written for.<br/><br/>But when Van Helsing says ""I think we've overstayed our welcome,"" it's hard to disagree."
"masterblaster882001","2","0","1","29 May 2004"," I've got a bad feeling about this...
","(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>OK, before I even start this, lets just say my expectations were extremely low. The previews for Van Helsing gave me flash-backs to League of Exdrodinary Gentlemen, which isn't a good thing. The flick started off alright, with a nice fight between Helsing and Dr. Jeckyl (Mr. Hyde?). However, thats where the fun pretty much ends. As a movie goes on, one expects the characters to be developed and given, well, character. All we know about Helsing is that he was found by the Vatican, and he hunts monsters for some secret government agency. When the protagonist has a mysterious past, its expected that in the movie, he's going to find out his past history. This, of course, never happens. At any time does the movie even try to tell the audience where this man came from.<br/><br/>Anyway, our protagonist goes on a journey to, wait for it, Transylvania where he, wait for it again, battles Dracula! Now this isn't your normal, everyday Dracula, who is slick, sly and seductive. This is a bad thing. Just when I thought the writer (Steven Summers) couldn't make a character less dimensional then Helsing, he tosses in Dracula. For some reason Dracula needs both Frankenstein's monster and a werewolf to raise his army of vampire offspring. Dracula, who is thousands of years old, calls Helsing by the name Gabriel. Apparently, he and Helsing have been battling for centuries, but neither Helsing nor the audience is ever fully clued in to this fact. Dracula only gets lamer when his weakness is revealed. For a reason unknown, Dracula is immune to the usual vampire slaying repitoir of sun light, garlic, and stakes to the heart. His only weakness is, werewolves. Wait, dosn't Dracula employ werewolves? Yes, he employs them for his personal protection, which is totally ludacris. Would Superman wear kryptonite underwear because of the added support? I think not. Oh yeah, Dracula is also a married man, three times over, who knew.<br/><br/>If I had a dollar for evertime I saw a twenty minute long ""fight scene"" between the brides of Dracula, or a werewolf, or any monster and Helsing, I could have paid for the movie, thrice. This presents another problem. Van Helsing is an action movie by nature, and one would assume that the movie sensibly sacrifices plot for explosions, death, and snappy one-liners, however it fails miserably at presenting any good action qualities. It regurgitates the same fights, by moving the location and number of people in the fight. The first fight will be on par with other recent action movies, the others will bore you to tears. The character development problem plagues this movie to every extent. Frankenstein's Monster, a John Goodman-esque meat-head, is either a super intelligent genius or a complete blithering idiot. Somewhere Mary Shelly is spinning in her grave at 100mph. Helsing discovers this poor sack in a cave, which Helsing conveniently fell into, and immediately falls in love with it. Even after Frankenstein insist that Helsing kill him because he is the key to Dracula's evil plan, Helsing insist that he won't, and that he must protect Fathead, and thus drag the dying horse of a movie on for another hour. Lastly, the movie takes itself way too seriously, for a flick that should've been a mindless monster bashing. Steven Summers, seems to think that when people go to action movies such as Van Helsing they are expecting to see a moving story with intense. This, of course, isn't true. Action movies should contain minimal plot, but still contain enough smooth and witty dialogue so the audience doesn't fall asleep from repeditive fight scenes made up of characters who the audience could care less died. <br/><br/>When making an action movie, a writer/director must follow three simple rules: 1) The enemy must be something hated by all: I suggest Natzi's, Commies, Terrorists, Robots from the future, Aliens, all of which will be hated by all red-blooded Americans, forever. 2) Special Effects alone don't make an action movie: Hooray! Explosions and Monsters that look soooooo real. Special effects work only when applied sensibly, or with good use (see Jurassic Park or Lord of the Rings). They are not made to replace dialouge or character development. 3) The audience MUST be able to connect with the protagonist: Whether its a vampire hunter or a NY police officer, the audience must be able to see life in the leading role. A lame character has no pull on the audience when the movie puts said character into danger.<br/><br/>Van Helsing failed on mostly every level. I'll give it points for nice visuals, but after two and a half hours, they get old. This is one of the first movies I've been too where I've seen people leave then movie before its been finished and show looks of disgust after the movie finished (and I saw 8 legged freaks). If your not wanting to pay 7+ bucks to see the poster for Spiderman 2 and the trailer for The Village, go to the library and read Bram Stroker's Dracula and Merry Shelly's Frankenstein, or if your not into the reading thing just rent some old monster movies. Trust me on this one.<br/><br/>Rating: * (1 out of 5 stars)"

","I had such high hopes for this movie.  I really did!  I loved the ""Mummy"" movies and Hugh Jackman was so wonderful in the X-Men films, so I was sure that ""Van Helsing"" would be great.  I was wrong.<br/><br/>""Van Helsing"" simply tries to do too much.

Everyone is here: Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, a couple of werewolves, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and some pretty cool looking vampire<br/><br/>brides and their hideous offspring.  One would think that with such an ensemble cast, this movie would be a thrilling rollercoaster ride.  But it's not. I'm not sure how such an action packed, monster filled movie can be so dreadfully dull, but I found myself falling asleep within 15 minutes.  Hugh Jackman was good, as he<br/><br/>usually is, and Kate Beckinsale as the butt-kicking beauty was only slightly less effective, but the dialogue is corny, (and sometimes, much too modern for the Edwardian setting) some of the acting borders on frantic and annoying<br/><br/>(especially in the case of Richard Roxburgh) and the plot simply tries too hard to mash together too many stories into a two hour time slot.  Frankenstein's<br/><br/>Monster was quite likable and very cool to look at, and David Wenham (Faramir from LOTR) provided some nice comedic touches, but I simply grew tired of cast members endlessly swinging across great chasms on ropes and sexy vampire<br/><br/>women going on and on about killing their victims instead of just going ahead and DOING it, already...a point addressed by Kate Beckinsale late in the film. The ending was both cheesy and a total downer but by that point, I was just<br/><br/>happy to see it end.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film, and I tried, but ultimately, I found it to be empty, emotionless, lifeless, flat, uninvolving, and shockingly dull.

","Van Helsing is not a movie, but rather a conglomeration of special effects attempting to be held together by B rate acting and virtually no plot. Granted, while a few of the special effects are cheesy and unrealistic, most are quite impressive, as are the computer graphics. It is easy for the viewer to be drawn into the movie by any of the action scenes.  However, while the special effects are convincing, the acting is equally unconvincing. Like a huge splash of ice water to the face, someone has to speak and we're brought right back into reality.  While there, it doesn't take much to notice the weak, hole-riddled plot.

","The first thing I can say about VAN HELSING, is that for the first time I have witnessed a side effect of vampirism  not only do they suck the blood off of you, they also suck your acting skills. What was Sommers thinking when he casted that group of community-theatre z graded actors, who cannot even maintain the same accent for more then one scene? The name of the title should be VAN HELSING  ADVENTURES IN OVER ACTING. It was the first time a fantasy movie can be accused of bigotry  the use of monsters stereotypes was borderline racism! What's wrong with some originality, why not try to, I don't know, something that wasn't done for a gazillion times? Couldn't Sommers find a new perspective for an already repeated Dracula/Frankenstein/Were-wolf story and outline? He did such a great job with THE MUMMY, why didn't he take the same great formula he had and just transferred the monster plot to it? For god sake, they didn't even a little bit of comic relief  nothing to ease the pain! You just cannot maintain a PG monster movie with absolutely no blood and gore without something for the soul! The lack of humorous relieves, combined with a bland story line that features nothing new, added to one of the most bad and ridicules acting performances (I am talking especially to you Kate Beckinsale and Richard Roxburgh), and you have one of the worst movies ever made, a stale experience at best, with a lesson to be learned for future directors  CGI is not a substitute for a plot or for acting quality.

Normally I do not do that. <br/><br/>Van Helsing is an updated version of Dracula with a few more twists put into it. The storyline and plot do have a bit to be desired, but who cares? There is so much action in this movie that you really don't notice the fact that these characters have been done, practically to death.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action adventure/horror movies.<br/><br/>It has all of the ingredients to be an eventual classic. Action/horror/sex appeal/comedy/drama. <br/><br/>This is one movie that I will more than likely purchase when it is released onto DVD."

","My husband and I had already read the rotten tomatoes review that gave it a dismal 24% but wanted to see it for ourselves. It was bad almost from the start. All the main actors (especially Richard Roxburgh as Dracula and Kate Beckinsale as the princess) had terrible accents and seemed to lose all acting ability. The story was poorly written, every cliché known to man was used, and the editing was very choppy. It seemed more like a comedy spoof than a serious film and we laughed the whole movie. For instance the part where Van Helsing as the werewolf was fighting Dracula. Dracula got cut and had his blood on his fingers and did some hilarious number where he stopped fighting and was deciding whether to lick his blood off of his fingers. I was in the floor rolling because his acting was so bad and the scene was just out of left field. This was a poor choice for Hugh Jackman. Even seeing his hairy rippling chest (does he have one movie that doesn't?) wasn't enough to save this movie."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5","0","1","26 May 2004"," Definitely not great, but surely not as bad as some claim
","This is a movie about the well-known famed monsters of the 1800's, mainly Dracula, The Wolfman and The Frankenstein Monster. While the original movies, and pretty much every movie about one of these creatures is a horror movie; this is, however, just a comic book movie that features them, and Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing. It has no horror in it at all; several of the creatures in the film are ridiculed more than they're feared(well, mainly Igor, but at times Frankenstein's Monster too). The movie does do something to pay respect to the source material, but, alas, most of it is lost in special effects. Nearly every scene features some form of special effects; there are more effects in the film than there are action sequences. I don't know any other films by Stephen Sommers, but in this, the action consists of far too much CGI, thereby giving us something to look at, rather than something to be excited about; granted, the CGI does look pretty good, but some ""all-live action"" action sequences would really have helped. I also found the action scenes to be fairly repetitive. Half of them either start or end with someone being swung by a wire/rope/whatever. That's an OK idea for one or two action scenes, but in this movie, it happens no less than five times. Then it just gets tedious and bland. You start to wonder if the director has too few ideas for how to put together action scenes. It also made me wonder if he had seen too much Tarzan as a child, and wanted to copy him swinging from tree to tree. Most of the action scenes also involve far too much talking, and far too little action. There was a scene were the vampires kept talking on and on for five minutes or so, before finally attacking the victim, whom they had cornered from the beginning of the scene; of course, this only happens to the main characters, anyone else is killed instantly. Which just makes it all the more predictable; quite unfortunate, seeing as how it was seemingly made to create tension and intensity. The action scenes are fairly intense, but the director hardly ever gives us time to breath between them, thereby just annoying the viewer, rather than giving an intense feel to the film. The action, whilst being intense, fails to excite or entertain, which leaves the viewer feeling bored. The talking in the action scenes also usually kill any form of excitement, rather than intensify it. In fact, the film seems to prefer special effects over action; there were several scenes that could have become great action sequences, instead something ""unexpected"" happens, and we are ""treated"" with more CGI. They also seemed to love the things they could do with the special effects far too much, resulting in them overusing it to the extreme(main examples being Dracula's walking on walls and werewolves & Mr. Hyde jumping constantly from one place to another, which just annoys and distracts the viewer). The plot is OK, but very far-fetched and only barely makes sense. I got the feeling that the script was written more or less around which plot twists the director wanted(in fact, if I'm not mistaken, Sommers also wrote the script, as well as directing it), and which action/special effects sequences he wanted in the film. The acting is not particularly good, but not bad, either(well, some of it, but most of it is OK). The Monster has the delivery of an opera singer... I wasn't sure if I should laugh at the poor acting, or clap at the notes he hit. The characters seemed too much like clichés; the bad-ass hero who cracks jokes and saves the day, the strong female who can fight for herself, except for when she needs to be rescued by the hero, the slow, goofy sidekick who's only in the film(at all) to provide comic relief, etc. The humor in the film is decent, however there is a little too much of it for a dark film based on horror movies. A few of the jokes did make me laugh, however, the goofy nature of several scenes made me laugh harder. All in all, a decent comic book movie that lacks any of the serious nature of its source material. I recommend this movie to fans of comic book movies, but fans of any/all of the source material should be advised, that this does not pay very much respect to the original stories. Just remember; you were warned. 5/10"

","Yeah, this is one of the best comedies i've ever seen. It's like ""Naked Gun"" but it's funnier to watch cuz, i think, this movie wasn't meant to be a comedy. The actor's playing is pretty bad, and the plot is just terrible. Guys, Dracula's children, millions of them (Godzilla), need Frankenstein's creature in order to be born. He will give them some kind of energy.......Who can stop evil Dracula, here comes our hero - Van Helsing (i think, they got the name from Bram Stoker's Dracula). This guy is kinda like James Bond (agent 007) of that time, and Vatican has some kind of secret agency, like FBI or something. There are so many fancy weapons (i think, they got some of them from Blade) in this movie (don't miss the part when our hero went to Vatican). In general, this is the must see movie.

","Ever heard of a spoof, or a parody perhaps... why is everyone taking this movie so seriously when it should be obvious to one and all that the director intended it to be a parody of all the old horror movies... comparing this to the original Frankenstein, Dracula and Wolfman movies is like comparing Airplane to the original Airport or Posidon Adventure... it is great, it is funny, it pays homage to so many of the old horror flicks that you almost get dizzy keeping up with the references... if anyone for a second thought about taking this movie seriously you only had to see Kate Beckinsale's outfit to realize that the director was thinking more of Zena than he was of a transylvanian maid... duh why do you think Van Helsing was wearing a fedora, for style perhaps, no cause you were supposed to think of him as Indiana Jones..., and the ballroom scene was a perfect lift from ""Dance of the Vampires"".... and the Q character could not have been more in your face ""I am a complete parody of Q in the James Bond movies"" if he'd have tried... come on folks this is not rocket science, noone is going to be cured of cancer by a movie, this is entertainment pure and simple and all of the actors had a blast overacting their pants off in this wonderful parody... if I have one problem it is that the CGI was a little too much sometimes.... I think the stage coach scene would have been much more fun if we had seen Hugh Jackman (or a stuntman) actually jumping from horse to horse rather than seeing a CGI character do it... however a couple of scenes scared the poop out of me (particularly the stage coach scene where they are driving along the edge of a cliff - read scared of heights anyone - also read plucked straight from the Bram Stoker's Dracula of late)... oh btw I am very confused at the people who want to know more about Van Helsings past..., were you not paying attention? It is stated quite clearly, VH is the archangel Gabriel, he originally killed Dracula... which is what turned Dracula into a vampire... sorry if you didn't catch it, perhaps you were too busy comparing to the lighting to that in Nosferantu..... oh and as for the princess's death.... well Dracula was dead, she could now die in peace knowing her entire family would be going to paradise her family's mission was over..., sorry you probably missed that too cause you were too busy comparing the lightning bolts in this one and the original Frankenstein... come on lighten up folks turn off your damn critics brain and enjoy this movie for what it is damn good fun. I loved it and will watch it again and again to catch more references that I may have missed the first time (I am sure there are loads of them). Can't wait to get it on DVD."

","I don't know what the hell is wrong with critics and people who downplay this movie. Lets start with my list of defenses:<br/><br/>*A complex plot? If you think the plot is complex and you do not understand it, you are sadly in the wrong cinema. I have read about most of the creatures (ie, frankensteins monster, vampires) and with an understanding of how they work had no problems understanding the plot. Those who did not were simply misinformed, or not informed at all.<br/><br/>*A strange opening sequence? To be honest, I think the opening was the best part. The black and white shading was quite significant. It uses the time when the stories were created to mesh the different characters into one story. It shows how scared people were at the time, as well as it sets the scene for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Personally, Van Helsing defies all the text book rules of cinema. But isn't that what makes good cinema? Run Lola Run wasn't textbook. Neither were many other greats. We still know them. So take your time to think. Van Helsing in my opinion is more than a must see. Because one must see to defy those who do not."

","What in the name of all that is sacred was that about? The company is only interested in getting a bigger audience(reducing the certificate, hence depriving us of what could have been a decent, if certainly not great monster movie), Stephen Sommers - he made Stargate, didn't he?, Hugh Jackman wants to be the next Bond so badly he obviously couldn't wait, Kate Beckinsale should start acting at some point in her life (what with Pearl Harbour, Underworld and now this), Richard Roxburgh tries too hard ... and I could go on. Apart from that, all the questions brought up by the screenplay are left unanswered (I won't reveal anything), the dialogue is plain awful, and to be honest the whole premise in which the movie is based is preposterous - I can't believe the Vatican hasn't reacted. As for the special effects, I seem to be the only one that noticed the blue screen pretty much throughout the whole movie. And, what's with the music? Could be the most irritating score in (and for)a long time - certainly not what I expected from Alan Silvestri. I tried to sleep through it, and I couldn't, so I decided to wait and see if something good would come (it does, without revealing anything, it's the wolf man transformation), then I tried to get my money back, but working in a cinema myself, I never paid in the first place, so now I am aiming to sue all the parts involved for emotional distress. The worst movie in history? Surely not. But pretty close, nonetheless."

How can you ever be able to turn such a potential idea in such a mess? I cannot imagine how anyone can think that this thing is valuable in any way. There was no acting, not even bad one. The action scenes are really over the top (I just say: swashbuckling at the bridge). The characters are as deep as the water level in the ""see of silence"" on the moon. The humour was as funny as tickling yourself with a fondue fork.<br/><br/>The story was a big balloon: nothing with a bit of colourful plastic surrounding that very nothing. The end was as predictable as the ending of Troy, but Troy is a classic epic. Everybody knows it. Fortunately, not everybody knows ""Van Helsing"" though... and that's a good thing. The only two good points about the flick are the music and the -spoiler- not so happy end. <br/><br/>I won't even buy this movie if it would be released at the price of 1.00 A complete waste of time and money and a complete waste of time that I even considered posting this here, but maybe I might save other people from this disaster."

","Van Helsing<br/><br/>Directed by Stephen Sommers Runtime: 132 min <br/><br/>OK, lets face it. This film is pap. It's cliché, hokie, and silly all at the same time. It's a CGI simulacra filled with attractive, athletic men and beautiful women with luscious curves and outfits that leave just a smidgen to the imagination. <br/><br/>Non-stop violence, bloodshed not to mention 5 classic literature (One is pleasant surprise!) icons that never seem to tire of constant celluloid exploitation. <br/><br/>Maybe that's why it was so much bloody Fun! <br/><br/>Being the horror fanatic that I am It was hard for me to contain my excitement when I heard of this film. However over the few months that preceded its release that excitement gave way to scepticism the more I learned about the intended plot and characters. Incorporating so many horror legends in one film that was barely 2 hrs long? No sure if that would work.<br/><br/>Though I'm still not sure that it acquitted its self on those grounds the plot threads do tend to touch and cross but not unduly or clumsily: No-one legend is left out in the cold. Each has a logical place (though be it stretched within the confines of the already fantastical plot) And all have a go at the spotlight. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has found a wonderful vehicle to pour all the angst that he never got to express as Wolverine. With a spaghetti western inspired costume and weapons that even by today's standards defy the laws of physics and technology, he nonetheless manages to keep us entertained.<br/><br/>But why the hell is he using a American accent? <br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh as Dracula gives a level, measured performance that never goes over the top. But the look is never quite convincing and never intimidating. <br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale exists solely in this film to give VanHelsing a potential love interest and keep us all awake and the 14 -35 crowd interested.<br/><br/>Boos for the in and out, ultra fake Eastern-Euro accent. Kudos for doing a great deal of her own stunts. <br/><br/>The essence of the Frankenstein monster is effectively and expertly portrayed considering the amount of screen time the charter is given to develop. <br/><br/>And a perversely enjoyable performance given By Robbie Coltrain as a character I won't reveal at this time. <br/><br/>I'm a werewolf biased person. So I won't bore you with how much I loved the wolf. OK, maybe a little. A newly imagined man-wolf-wolf-man morph was inspiring! And the sheer ferocity of the creature makes you want to get on both knees with respect. The only character that inspires fear on any level.<br/><br/>Over all I think it was money well spent. Ten bucks and time that would have been wasted in front on the tube, XBOX controller in hand.<br/><br/>2.5 D@*%s up! (Out of five) <br/><br/>Go to the movies!"

When you're in Popcorn City, you don't stay long in the museum of high art.<br/><br/>The New York Post blusters that Van Helsing `requires considerable suspension of disbelief'. No flies on those guys, eh, what with the streets being chock-full of vampires, werewolves and Frankenstein's monsters these days? Maybe they were referring to Kate Beckinsale's unsmudgeable make-up. Of course it's silly, loud and all over the place  that's the point. Those of a pretentious disposition are advised to stay home and pore over their Ingmar Bergman collections.<br/><br/>This is non-stop, tongue-in-cheek fun. Even the exposition is larky. As scene crashes on top of OTT scene, it's amusing just to spot all the films being ripped off/borrowed from/homaged/pastiched: Aliens, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Stagecoach, Desperado, Gremlins, From Dusk Till Dawn, Star Wars, and any James Bond you care to mention.

And I don't think that anyone expected Anna to die. Even though it sorta sucked that she died, it was a good ending. The fact that she died made the movie more realistic, because not everything has a happy ending. The graphics were awesome, especially with the werewolves. Plus, Hugh Jackman was hot.

It's possible to make an intelligent film that appeals to both adults and children - the original Star Wars trilogy and The Lord Of The Rings are proof of this.

Bram Stoker honestly will be rising to kill Steven Sommers in a fit to some how right the wrong that was this movie. I am sick to death of films being made purely to make money. This was in noway a good film. It was not slick, no sophistication that usually accompanies vampire movies. I could not take Dracula seriously, there was a comic relief monk. I strongly recommend avoiding this movie for the purposes of trying to put stop to Hollywood cheese. The ending was pitiful with Jackman looking into the clouds seeing Beckinsale's character uniting with her family, is this type of cheese really necessary, brutality is what was needed especially when dealing with the vampire of all vampires Dracula. Sommers has destroyed the story in every sense. There really is only one thing i can say had any substance in this movie and that was the special effects and they should not have been wasted on a film such as this. I seriously hope that the monster movies as a genre have not disappeared.

Nobody has any right to think this movie is less than perfect.<br/><br/>The story was so incredible! The way they worked in Frankenstein and the Wolfman was beyond sweetness.

Oh, and I can't even begin to describe how amazing the special effects were. They were probably the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And lets not forget the characters. They were probably the best part of the whole thing. Here are just a few aspects of how cool they were:<br/><br/>Van Helsing:<br/><br/> From the previews he looked like one of those Spiderman ""Oh, my life's work is also my curse, it's so hard, boo hoo hoo..."" but this guy wasn't all crybaby about it. He took pride in nuking the hell out of all evil. I know what you're thinking, how all vampire hunters are automatically cool, but no other ones can even touch him. He doesn't just run around with a stake in his hands like these other idiots do. No, he gets a kick-ass auto-crossbow and blasts the crap out of them. Screw garlic necklaces and all that other pansy garbage. This is, like, the new age of vampire hunting.<br/><br/>The Friar:<br/><br/>Now this dude was my hero. He's like some quiet monk guy who's helping Van Helsing with all this high-tech equipment, but he still finds time to do the no-no cha-cha with a random chick. Plus, he was always there when somebody needed his help<br/><br/>Dracula:<br/><br/>No more of these boring old geezer vampires who look like they'll have a heart attack any second. If you cross him the wrong way, say good-bye to your soul. He'll be like talking to you one second, and then all of a sudden *chomp* you're dead. Before you know it he's picking pieces of your neck out of his teeth.<br/><br/>Anna:<br/><br/>Cool. <br/><br/>Frankenstein monster:<br/><br/>You except him to be some mindless monster going ""ugg....uuugggg..."" all the time and just being a huge inconvenience to everyone else. But once again a character's not what you expect. He looked so ugly, yet he was so peaceful and friendly. He was willing to sacrifice his own life for others. Now that's a stud right there.<br/><br/>Torches, flying, darkness, crossbows, bombs, gravestones, ooze, secret passageways, huge jumps, pitchforks, insane laughter, racing coaches, revenge, thunderstorms, and more. WHAT ISN'T THERE TO LIKE????<br/><br/>If you thought this movie was bad in any way, shape, or form, please kindly tattoo the word ""worthless"" on your forehead and bury your face in the sand.

Had me on edge, and it's been a while since I've been to a movie like that. Definitely worth the price of admission."

","I followed the hype for this movie pretty closely and I was excited that it was directed by Stephen Sommers who borough us the Mummy films and starred Hugh Jackman. But about 30 minutes in the movie goes on auto-pilot and the effects completely take over. It seems doubtful taht Hugh Jackman had to do much physically for this film as CG(computer generated) versions of him seem to be doing all the work. I enjoyed the campiness of this film, the supporting cast was great (Richard Roxburgh is great as an over the top Dracula and David Wenham as the bumbling side kick gets most of the laughs) but I felt like I was watching a cartoon. And maybe taht was the whole point, but I'm a little old fashioned and I don't mind some of that new fangled CG stuff to make way for some good IL' traditional stunt work. I think given a smaller budget this movie would have been more then just a 2 hour sense assault."

","I expected this film to be Corny as most of the films Hollywood has been putting out lately, and I found it to be so, but differently. It seemed like this film was TRYING to be cheesy which worked for it, I think. Although there's not much depth to it and some parts are slightly predictable, the character development is quite entertaining. At first glance the previews might also make it seem like the effects are not good either. I, again, think otherwise. They were quite fair and the eccentricity of some of the ""creatures"" works well with the overall feel of the film. I may just be biased because I already have an overwhelming love for vampires and the like, but even so, the exaggeration adds to the over the top feeling the film tries to capture. <br/><br/>Also, I can't say I didn't enjoy Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxburgh's acting (and themselves of course). Guys will probably like the hilarious wives of Dracula. Its quite amusing because they seem groupie-ish (hanging around him all the time and emoting the same feelings he does, but in a more exaggerated way ^_^).<br/><br/>So yea, pretty good!<br/><br/>Oh yes forgot to mention, lots of homages to old monster films make it even more interesting."

","I know some people believe that this movie wasn't really good, but I disagree. The movie was a great mix of action, suspense, and humor. For those that believed that some scenes were a little campy, it should be reminded that they were trying to bring back some of the old horror movie experience (as shown with the black and white scene) and not bring everything in all new. The special effects were great and the movie also brought new twists to the characters while mostly keeping their traditional roles. Also the ""friar"" brought in humor at just the right times to create a great balance of content. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes this genre. It really is lots of fun."
"author1995","Null","0","1","24 May 2004"," Hit and Missed Opportunities
","I was rather sceptical when I heard about the movie's monster parade, but they are meshed into one piece astonishingly well, I think - Dracula was killed and accepted vampirism rather than die, the gypsy's vowed to stop him and thus took onto themselves the curse of the werewolf (if you look closely, you notice that all werewolves apart from Van Helsing are family members, even if they need to be bitten to get infected), because only a werewolf can stop Dracula (that is also the reason why the gypsy's need to stop the count before they are allowed into Heaven - werewolves don't look good with angels' wings, after all), and Dracula hires Frankenstein because he wishes his children to live, a feat that only the obsessed Doctor can accomplish. Van Helsing as Dracula's killer only makes everything come full circle.<br/><br/>That's the hit, now the miss. The vampires' ball is set magnificiently (re also Polanski's Fearless Vampire Killers and the ball there), but it's missed opportunities all along. Much more could have been made of masks. Much, much more of Carl's fool costume. And the weird artistes were not used to their full effect. The entire ball should by rights have been one of the high points of the movie, instead it was a rather short quote and a waste of space that gets only worse when you consider how much money must have gone into it. A pity, really."

","The polls seem to be hovering around 50%, for those who like the movie and those who don't. There's a simple explanation. While I'd imagine a number of people thought as I did, ""wow, that looks awful, but it's by the guy that did the Mummy remake,"" it all depends on why you watched the Mummy in the first place. If you saw the Mummy because it looked like a cool, Indiana Jones-esque adventure movie and special effects showcase, you may not care much for Van Helsing, despite all its action. On the other hand, if you saw the Mummy remake because you owned and loved the original 1932 movie, with all its outdated campiness, then you'll love Van Helsing. It's like watching ""Frankenstein v. the Wolf Man,"" or something along those lines, only with updated style and effects. So, if you are a big fan of all the Universal monster originals, you have to see this movie. If you are not, well.. you probably want to do something else with your 5 to 10 bucks."
"shawnrhod","3","0","1","18 May 2004"," By far - Not the Movie to 'Kickoff the Summer'
","Well, this happens to me only once in awhile. I decide to see a 'Blockbuster' movie on opening day. Problem is that I don't have a chance to assess creditable reviews on media blitzed Hollywood movies, which exaggerates false promise and almost always disappointswith few exceptions (i.e. Spiderman 1, Gladiator).<br/><br/>Van Helsing was no-exception. This was out write terrible. I guess this could have been my fault. I new the direction the movie was headed. A Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) directed, PG 13 rated, summer blockbuster that needs to cover its cost by grabbing the widest possible audience. Lets make a vampire movie for the family, so to speak. OK, with that said, I will expect a fast action, corny (yet sometimes funny) dialog, computer animated joy ride. If this is your cup-of-tea, then the 'formula was there.' However, the movie lacked all the major support elements. <br/><br/>The story was muddy and boring. What was Dracula's end result? Gremlin babies to fly around and do what, torment the world. This was never really clarified for me. Besides why in the world would Dracula want to create little gremlin vampires when he has an endless count of full grown, equally as menacing vampires chilling at his masquerade. If death by a certain creature were the only way to destroy Dracula, then why wouldn't he eliminate or keep the threat as far away as possible??? There are many questions like these you'll be asking yourself during and after the movie. Like, what happened to the original ware wolf, and did they literally bite that idea from Blade 2 (you'll understand when you see the movie).<br/><br/>Maybe the Friar Carl played by David Wenham (Lord of the Rings), would have been a nice comic relief but the exhausting vibe of the rest of the movie absorbed any liking one could have for the witty Friar. In fact, all characters were boring; I don't care how good they looked. Kate's character had fluctuations in her accent. Hugh's character has flat. Dracula had a clip in his hair, and the women vampire's were sexy, but unnecessarily screamed and wined. I could care less what happened to the characters in the end. It turned out to be comical and I just wanted the movie to conclude.<br/><br/>Kate and Hugh are terrific actors; they are both attractive and have immense screen presence. Putting Kate (the Vampire movie lover) aside, I'm extremely disappointed in Hugh. I don't expect him to pick up the slack for a horrific screenplay, but I do expect him to make better decisions in the future. I have no problem if Hugh is chasing money and popularity, but at least set a standard for movie selections. This is your first big mistake 'Hollywood Hugh,' please don't make another, at least not anytime soon. I'd hate to compare your movie selections to your Aussie counter part Heath Ledger.<br/><br/>I was hoping to see a different movie here, one for adults or the less squeamish child. I needed Van Helsing to follow along the lines of 'Allen Hughes's From Hell,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula,' and/or Sleepy Hollow. These movies were dark and had an eerie feeling. They as well as director M. Night Shyamalan prove that subtle suggestions and a brilliant story can have a greater effect, then CG and overwhelming media hype. <br/><br/>I hope this movie isn't an inclination of this summer's silver screen newbies. I'm very skeptical of 'Troy' and 'Spiderman.' However, I'm extremely excited about the Village."
"MartPol","6","0","1","24 May 2004"," Stop it! You're hurting my ears!
","As we might all have guessed before setting foot inside the cinema, Van Helsing very quickly and very loudly proclaims that it comes from the same director as the two recent Mummy films. Stephen Sommers appears to be entirely incapable of understanding tension, character development or indeed quiet moments of any sort, and succeeds in spending the entire film slapping on sound and visual effects in such thick layers that the audience becomes stupefied.<br/><br/>Aside from a few original and interesting bits - the characterisation of Frankenstein's creature and Igor, the James Bond spoofery at the beginning, the exploding mini-vampires - it's also a film that relies almost entirely on cliche. Sommers just can't help himself using tired camera angles and hackneyed script, and seems to have asked his composer to add 'atmospheric' (lazy) string music to just about every scene. He's also not averse to constantly reusing ideas once he's had them: people screaming/shouting ""Van Helsing!"" and people being thrown into walls appear to be among his favourites, and there are so many instances of Van Helsing's sidekick doing/saying something reluctant/cowardly, that it just stops being funny.<br/><br/>Sommers needs to learn a few lessons from Steven Spielberg - how to loosen up a little and let the audience become interested in the characters, and how bombarding us with surround-sound bangs and screams from beginning to end is not the best way to make an action film."

"movieguy1021","Null","0","1","18 May 2004"," Van Helsing: 4/10
","Van Helsing officially started off the 2004 summer movie season. By the looks of it, it's gonna be a crappy season. Van Helsing takes whatever of the audience's intelligence (but then again, since this is from the director of The Mummy, the audience doesn't have much), and throws it out of the window. Every other scene contradicts the other, and there are so many plot holes and unnecessary plot developments that it's hardly worth following. Now, before you chastise me for taking an action movie too seriously, let me go into the plot.<br/><br/>Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is someone who fights evil for the current hot topic in films-a secret order of Catholic priests. He is sent to Transylvania to defeat Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), as that will save the whole Valerious family from Hell (long story). Once he gets there, he battles the brides of Dracula with the last remaining Valerious, Anna (Kate Beckinsale). Along with his nerdish sidekick Carl (David Wenham), they go to battle evil, along with all of Universal's other monsters, Frankenstein and The Wolf Man.<br/><br/>There are two schools of thought for this movie. One is that it's an entertaining movie with intentionally bad CGI, a movie you should just sit back and enjoy. The other is that as much as you wanted to enjoy the movie, you couldn't because of the story. I am in the second. I enjoyed writer/director Stephen Sommers' Mummy movies, as I was able to suspend my belief, something I was not able to do for Van Helsing. The character of Van Helsing was, I believe, in the Dracula series, yet he was taken completely out of context as this monster-hunter. At least the movie makes sure that we know who the Universal characters are.<br/><br/>To prove my point, here are some examples of how little this movie cares about entertaining our brains. A subtitle claims that Vatican City is in Rome. Although technically it is, the Vatican is a country, not ""part"" of Rome. Latin writings used improper grammatical syntax. Vampires, which everyone knows can only come out at night, attack in the broad daylight. Full moons come a dime a dozen. Werewolf transformations, which supposedly cause the transformer the first time, flows seamlessly when someone becomes a werewolf. Vampires can travel quicker than Transylvanian horses, ""the fastest thing on Earth"". Whenever anything touches the ground, it blows up. Werewolf serum can only be given within the twelve strokes of midnight when the werewolf first transforms, and, by God, according to this movie, those are the longest twelve strokes ever. Raging monsters, such as Mr. Hyde, can control their actions. And no one, not even the physically fit Van Helsing, can swim down about one foot. And people say ""leave your brains at the door"" for this one. Even if you do you'll still find faults.<br/><br/>As for the action sequences, sure, they beat twiddling your thumbs, but that by no means means that they were exciting. It's like the culminating fight in The Two Towers: after a while, seeing random computer-generated freaks fighting each other becomes boring. Sometimes it flaunts itself, saying ""look what we can do!"", but much better (and emotionally involving) transformations took place in The Hulk. And sometimes the movie seemed bored with itself, so it added stupid smart-aleck sayings by Van Helsing-almost none of which were funny. Jackman looked out of place in this role-no wonder he originally refused it. He doesn't know what to do with the character, but it's not his fault. It's the script's fault, and I suppose that Van Helsing is the best you can do with a crappy script like this one.<br/><br/>My rating: 4/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for nonstop creature action violence and frightening images, and for sensuality."

Hugh Jackman is just doing his usual ""I wanna be Clint Eastwood"" routine...and those accents - it is SO getting at my nerves that they both make up some phony accent but doesn't even have the common decency to stick to it. Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to brush his accent away in his recent movies, these two ""actors"" are having a quite hard time remembering to USE their phony accents all the time - not very believable when ordinary American accents (Jackman) or English accents (Beckinsale) slips through...very amateurish indeed!<br/><br/>Still an entertaining movie though, but many things does that this is just average in the end..<br/><br/>5/10"

'Van Helsing' is an interminable, hokey, and noisy action-adventure film that's a monster mash, with none of the original mythology, but feels more like a 2-hour videogame. Late 19th-century monster hunter Van Helsing gets sent to Transylvania by a secret organization to take out Count Dracula, with the help from gypsy vampire hunter Beckinsale (can you buy that Transylvanian accent?), but first he must slay his way through the Count's three vampire brides, the Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's monster. Characters and plot take a backseat for overproduced, yet staggering, set pieces and special effects overkill (we know nothing about the title character). Interest level lags at times and repetition pads the two hours. Running Time: 131 minutes and rated PG-13 for non-stop creature action violence, frightening images, and sensuality. * 1/2"

","In this age of FREDDY VS. JASON, LEAGUE OF EXTRORDINARY GENTLEMEN and the upcoming ALIENS VS PREDATOR, where team-ups and dream duels are getting attention, siccing one of the original monster hunters onto the phalanx of Universal's monster stable seems like the ultimate idea borrowing from such great premises as FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN and Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN. Unfortunately VAN HELSING is more akin to ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN. <br/><br/>Perfect in concept, Stephen Sommers sets Man of the Church, Vampire Hunter Van Helsing to confront and destroy the most unholy of monster triumvirates, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Werewolf  and throw in Mr. Hyde to start the adventure off. Beautifully paying homage to FRANKENSTEIN at the film's start, VAN HELSING soon degrades into clichés and the convenience of unoriginality. From the scene in Rome where Friar Carl plays Q to Van Helsing's Bond to Van Helsing and Anna wading through hordes of unborn vampire sacs ala ALIEN's Ripley to the Indiana Jones-style stunts, the overused familiarity of the scenes became tedious. Sommers even had nods to Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS and if the Frankenstein Monster broke into song and soft shoe like Peter Boyle in YOUNG FRANKESTEIN, well, that wouldn't have been too surprising.<br/><br/>What VAN HELSING does offer is some fun action, cool stunt work and great camera angles taking the viewer along on this magical monster tour. Hugh Jackman proves, once again, that he is indeed a great action hero and holds together a mediocre script on a rather good- looking film with a solid cast. Richard Roxburgh's Dracula will hopefully be remembered and Kevin J. O'Connor's Igor blended both horror and humor. Alan Silvestri's score was perhaps too good for the likes of this movie and is a definite high point.<br/><br/>If sequels are to scare up, hopefully Sommers will bring the Van Helsing character back to its more creepy and mysterious origins. One needs look no further than Coppola's 1992 Dracula with Anthony Hopkins in the hunter's role. Adding too much 'super' in the 'supernatural' role made VAN HELSING, like it's final battle scene, both wanting and wacky."

Where to start?<br/><br/>Firstly, check the cast list Sommers, Brendan Fraser isn't in this one. Without his irresistible goofy wit the one-liners will flatten. And without his reliable gung-ho, love for the hero is also sliced in half. Without Oded Fehr to back him up there's no co-adventurer we'll swear allegiance to.

You can't Nintendo it all up and make these beasties as commonplace as vermin! These characters existed before they existed, every culture knows em, passed down over centuries.

I anticipated the witty humor and intriguing action of Sommer's past film, ""The Mummy."" I was extremely disappointed. The plot, or should I say lack of, is simply a device to propel continuing action scenes. The characters are flat, undeveloped and uninteresting. The attempted witty dialogue fails miserably. It is the most awful screenplay I've ever encountered. The directing was beyond horrifying, reducing the performances of Jackman, Roxburgh, and Beckinsale to cheesy, overacted stereotypes, and what is with Dracula's brides striking ""vogue"" poses in the background all the time? The only saving graces of this film are the special effects, action scenes, and the wonderful comic relief performance of David Wenham. And, unfortunately, these are not enough to make the movie worth the time or money required to see it."
"sweet_cuppin_cakes","Null","0","1","16 May 2004"," Mentally challenged film (SPOILERS)
","Van Helsing is an abysmally stupid film. As I write this review, I have had to delete almost every sentence I've written. I can't even begin to articulate how idiotic it is. I suppose I'll just have to number off the weak points, that you may do what you will with the information I give you.<br/><br/>1. The film copies most of the popular films of the last... well, most films, period. Take, for instance, the opening sequence, featuring a large, poorly-animated CGI Mr. Hyde, which struck me as a rip-off of 2003's Hulk.<br/><br/>2. Hugh Jackman's hasty, apathetic, circular Sign of the Cross. Wax on, wax off.<br/><br/>3. Kate Beckinsale's outfit. Because, if you're going to go capture/chase/kill monsters, and there's a chance you'll have to do a lot of running, best to wear sexy, thigh-high boots, spandex pants and a corset.<br/><br/>4. Hugh Jackman's occasional lapse into his natural Aussie accent, a problem I've spotted in both X-Men movies before this.<br/><br/>5. The Van Helsing character himself: A tough guy who fights evil, can't remember his past, and has some unrevealed connection to his mortal enemy. I liked him better the first time, when he was called Wolverine (and you must understand, dear reader, that I do not particularly care for Wolverine).<br/><br/>6. The most unscary Dracula ever witnessed. It's scary how not scary he is.<br/><br/>And you can taahhll he's Drraahhhculaaaahh by his faahhntaahstic Traahnsylvaahnian aaahhcent.<br/><br/>7. Kate Beckinsale's hasty manner of speaking throughout the entire film. At least she saved me 30 more minutes of sitting through this film by speaking so unnecessarily quickly.<br/><br/>8. Anna Valeria's unexplained animosity towards Frankenstein's Monster. I mean, she really had it out for the poor guy. She begs Van Helsing not to kill her brother, who has become a violent, murderous Werewolf. Hey, it's understandable not to want your brother to die, but she couldn't get it through her thick skull that he was going to kill innocent people, including herself, which meant that she would never have a chance to kill Dracula, and Bubby Dearest would never get into Heaven. But she's simply FURIOUS at Van Helsing for refusing to kill Frankenstein's Monster, a sweet, kind, articulate hermit who never hurt a fly. In fact, she eagerly GRABBED A GUN OUT OF VAN HELSING'S HAND, just to try and shoot the poor guy!<br/><br/>9. The fornications of Van Helsing's Fryar friend. Because you see, as long as you are not technically a man of the cloth, it's perfectly acceptable to go against God's law.<br/><br/>10. The eggsacks out of which baby vampires are born, dripping with Dracula semen. Mmm mmm, good.<br/><br/>11. Jabs at oral sex during a pivotal battle scene against Dracula's Brides.<br/><br/>Distasteful.<br/><br/>12. Dracula's mirror. Why oh why does Dracula have a mirror? Was he planning on entertaining all the little vampires once they had arrived with his ""magic"" flying hat trick?<br/><br/>13. A plot hole I could get lost and starve to death in. We are told that Van Helsing has some sort of connection to Dracula, but that's it. It's never even touched upon after that.<br/><br/>14. Anna Valeria's lament of never having seen the sea, which I suppose was supposed to make me feel bad for her. I've never seen the sea either, toots, but I don't go complaining to monster slayers about it.<br/><br/>15. Transalvanian horses. Weren't you aware that there are magical, super-fast, flying horses in Transalvania? It's true! Anna Valeria says so!<br/><br/>16. Dracula's servants, which appear to be leftover Jawas from Star Wars.<br/><br/>17. Dracula's masquerade ball. I wasn't aware that so many vampires moonlight as circus performers.<br/><br/>18. Much swinging about on chains towards the end of the movie. Think Spider-Man, only less sensical.<br/><br/>19. The entire chase scene involving the magical horses. They pan over a big map, as though they've been traveling for months, even though the race is presented in real-time over the course of ten minutes.<br/><br/>20. Anna Valeria's death. After an entire movie's worth of being slammed with much velocity into any number of hard objects and getting up without so much as an ache, she is suddenly killed after the Van Helsing Werewolf slams her into a soft couch.<br/><br/>I've really only begun to touch upon how lacking this film is. You'll really have to see it to understand how truly, tragically moronic it is.<br/><br/>That said, I must give the Devil his due by saying that I really enjoyed the opening sequence, a beautiful black and white scene that mimics the original Frankenstein up to a point, when Dracula comes into play. Really brilliant.<br/><br/>All in all, I suppose that, if you watch this film while drunk, and knowing full well how stupid it is, you can see the stupidity as endearing and humorous, and enjoy the special effects, which were well done, for the most part. Me? Well, it looks like my sister and I will be breaking out the camcorder and filming a parody this summer.<br/><br/>3/10."

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie. The thought of all the great monsters(together)and the ultimate good guy sounded like it would be good. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The film was not only full of holes but had the flat no depth look of a video game through-out. I am tired of computed generated films. I want to see as much ""real"" as possible and not be short changed. All the unnatural moves and absolutely impossible things do nothing to make the hero look like a human.<br/><br/>Whatever happened to cinematography?

"dr_scott","6","0","1","16 May 2004"," I wanted to like ""V.H."", I really did...
","I like Hugh Jackman (""Van Helsing's"" Recalcitrant Hero); I like Kate Beckinsale (The Stunning Heroine); I like Richard Roxburgh (The Sexy Anti-Hero) and David Wenham (The Hero's Quirky Sidekick). And the first quarter-hour of ""Van Helsing"" (""V.H."") starts off promisingly, in Paris, with our hero battling Mr. Hyde (Dr. Jekyll's alter ego) in Notre Dame cathedral. Granted, some liberties have been taken with the Parisian geography and Notre Dame's architecture, but who cares? I wanted to see a big, over-the-top movie, and ""V.H."" is certainly that. But, like Count Dracula, it has no heartbeat, no real soul. (How's that for an analogy, eh?) It's one gravity-defying set piece after another. I found myself thinking about the last generation of movies and movie-goers: If you were in the ticket queue and you overheard someone coming out of the theater saying ""Weren't the locations in the film beautiful?"", you knew that the person was looking for something nice to say because film itself was a stinker. Instead we now say ""Weren't the effects fantastic?"" And indeed, the combination of motion capture and keyframe animation - especially when the brides of Dracula swoop in to terrify the poor Transylvanian villagers who must live with not only vampires but also werewolves and - for a time - Dr. Frankenstein (who leaves his misunderstood ""monster"" behind) as well. (Why don't these people move?) I felt particularly sorry for Jackman: It's one thing to play the strong, silent type, but it's quite another to not have enough material to really (pardon the pun) sink your teeth into. And I don't believe I'm spoiling the film by saying that in the climactic fight scene finale, he's hardly seen: His digital double does all the heavy lifting. But in a way this was the logical conclusion, since throughout the film almost all the other main characters appeared to enjoy themselves more than V.H.--even if they were often guilty of chewing the scenery (again, sorry about the pun). So my advice would be as follows: Want to see Hugh Jackman? Watch ""X-Men 2"". Kate Beckinsale? Go for a little film called ""Shooting Fish"". In the meantime, I've heard that there will probably be a ""V.H. 2"", and why not? When your enemy is the undead you can go on and on and on...."
"justanrmlcritic","6","0","1","16 May 2004"," Amazing what special effects does for people.......
","After reading most of the people that say this is an ""awesome"" movie I find it hilarious how people get awed by special effects. The movie itself was just OK. Sure special effects are hard but they shouldn't make a movie good or ""awesome"". I was hoping a lot better of a movie. Acting was nothing special, plot sucked, and some moments that were suppose to scare people actually made me laugh... (like when Dracula screamed at his brides) Only decent part of the film was the special effects. Everything else was lacking. I left the theatre thinking that movie sucked. There is a lot missing in this movie. If the movie is so amazing might as well buy it on DVD instead of paying $16 bucks and the theatre and another $20 for the DVD....."
"Rob_Taylor","7","0","1","16 May 2004"," Van Helstink
","Let me start this review by saying that I was predisposed to like this movie right from the start. I like horror movies and the meeting of three great movie legends - Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's Monster - seemed to me to be an interesting and entertaining combination. Plus, the movie was by Stephen Sommers, director of The Mummy, which is one of my favourites. Then there was the cast - Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham. All these factors combined to bring a great sense of anticipation in me that this would be a great movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>It's not bad, by any means, but the things which make a movie great just aren't there. In trying to understand why this film didn't do anything for me, I can point to several factors, one of which, ironically, is one of the reasons I thought I would enjoy the film - the meeting of three screen legends. But let's go through it point by point.<br/><br/>Firstly there's Richard Roxborough. Now, he looks like a good Dracula, I'll give him that, but unfortunately, from the moment he opened his mouth to deliver his characters first line, I found myself struggling not to laugh. His accent isn't terrible, but it's just the wrong side of a Realistic/Carry On movie accent to be anything but humorous. Any menace his character had was ruined by that.<br/><br/>Secondly, there's altogether too much swinging from ropes, cables and chains in this film. It's entirely pointless, for the most part, and speaks of a lack of imagination when writing the scenes. The opening scene at Notre Dame cathedral, for instance, involves a scene with ropes. There's countless others throughout the film until you're left with the feeling that you're watching a Tarzan movie.<br/><br/>Thirdly, and perhaps the most annoying. The CGI. It's just plain cack. None of the creatures look particularly realistic, in fact, they look like exactly what they are....CGI. Now, you'd think that a director whose movie The Mummy Returns was so slammed for the awful CGI Scorpion King at the end would have learnt from that mistake, but apparently not. Don't get me wrong, the CGI in VH is not anywhere near as bad as in TMR. But at no point in any of the scenes involving living (or unliving) entities do you not know that they are CGI. Although not awful, at some points it does begin to make you sigh sadly. Likewise the cuts between real actors and CGI are not done as well as might be expected. And what was the deal with the CGI Dracula? Talk about overweight! That just looked ridiculous.<br/><br/>Fourthly, the combo of all the legendary monsters. I had thought this would be a good thing, but in fact none of the creatures got the development they deserved, instead being relegated to ""also-ran"" status. I think if they had picked one monster and written a story around that - a la The Mummy - it would have made a better film, and provided for sequels. As it is, Stephen Sommers has shot his load by using all three staples (and never mind Dr Jekyll at the start!) and hasn't anywhere to go after this. At least, nowhere that makes any sense, anyhow.<br/><br/>Finally, the physics. No, I'm not going to go all ""undead-can't-exist-because..."" on ya. It's just that a lot of the CGI scenes involving falling, or swinging from ropes just don't look right. The eye perceives something that doesn't gel with your experiences of reality. And, as a result, the whole scene is ruined. It seemed to me that most of the swinging arcs in the film were actually parabolas, not arcs. In fact, the whole film has a ""watching someone else play a video game"" feel.<br/><br/>There are some bright moments to the movie, though. Well...OK. One. David Wenham gives a truly hilarious performance as Van Helsing's side-kick. Along with Kevin O'Connors Igor, these two improve the film no end. I've noticed this before in some movies - when you care about minor characters more than the main ones - it's usually an indication that the film isn't that good.<br/><br/>In summary then, the movie fails to deliver it's promise, though I doubt that'll stop it from becoming a hit this summer. At no point do you really feel either frightened or amazed. Nor does it really make you care about any of the characters. At no point do you feel that VH will fail in his mission to destroy the Count. In short, there are no surprises, except the execrable CGI.<br/><br/>In other words, another movie that has failed to live up to the hype surrounding it, much like Kill Bill 2, although not that awful. I can only hope The Day After Tomorrow and Troy don't go the same way. Watch it once, then forget it."
"lisaberrry","Null","0","1","15 May 2004"," Mr.Sommers owes me $13.90
","I hated this movie more than words can describe.<br/><br/>It was long. It was drawn out. It was predictable. This in itself wouldn't be bad, but it didn't have the campy feeling movies like this usually have. If it was trying to be a satire of a horror fantasy action movie, it might have been interesting, but it was trying to be serious.<br/><br/>Here are some specifics that bothered me (re: **********SPOILERS*************)<br/><br/>1. Killing the Mommy Vampires didn't kill the baby vampires. If the first set of hatchlings were, as was said, one litter from one bride, it stands to reason that all of the little Vampires were created by the Brides. Rules of Vampiredom should ensure that killing the mommy kills the babies. However, it took killing Dracula to kill the babies. One could argue that it was Dracula's idea to use Dr.Frankenstein's method that made them, but Dracula didn't actually do the leg work. If anything, since it was Igor pulling the switches and Frankenstein giving the juice, killing one of THEM should have been what killed the babies.<br/><br/>2. Wipe the blood off your lip, Anna. I know you know it's there. I don't care how ""sexy"" that was supposed to look, it was annoying.<br/><br/>3. How long does it take to bite Dracula? If you're a big tough werewolf that can grab him by the throat and hold him there, giving him a little nibble should be easy as pie and not take 30 minutes of my valuable time.<br/><br/>4. The cloud scene was stupid and hokey as hell. We know Anna's family was all saved and could go to heaven. We're not retarded. Don't beat us over the head with it. Also, did this make anyone else think of The Lion King?<br/><br/>5. I think the vampire babies popping was subliminal messaging to get movie patrons to buy more popcorn. I guess that's not really an annoyance, just an observation.<br/><br/>6.If I were Dracula, I'd be carrying the werewolf antidote with me everywhere. EVERYWHERE. I'd have gallons of it made and carry syringes full of it everywhere. I would sleep with it under my (coffin) pillow. I would bathe in it daily so that when werewolves bit me, they'd be instantly cured and their bites ineffectual. I wouldn't leave it at the top of some stupid tower that's not easily accessible. That's just asking for trouble.<br/><br/>7. The howling at the moon scene after Anna is killed looked like something a Kindergarten Special Ed class would make.<br/><br/>8. I haven't been able to predict a movie this entirely since Sweet Home Alabama, where I sat on the couch next to my best friend and recited the lines, almost word for word, as the characters were saying them. NOTHING shocked me or made me think in this movie. NOTHING!!!!!!!<br/><br/>In conclusion, next time Stephen Sommers wants to make a movie, I suggest he save himself time and money and simply vomit on some paper for a script, then rub dog feces on film. The effect would be the same. Also, Mr.Sommers owes me $13.90 and 3 hours of my life."
"herumesueni","1","0","1","19 May 2004"," Plan 9 From Transylvania
","Okay, in all fairness, this film doesn't have quite the level of overall badness that made Plan 9 From Outerspace what it was. But it's definitely up there (down there?) with Battlefield Earth.<br/><br/>The special effects in Van Helsing are horribly lacking. The CGI (which is used way too heavily) is over used and LOOKS like CGI. Some of the CGI effects reminded me of Ray Harryhasuen's stop motion creatures from Jason and the Argonauts and the Sinbad movies. (by the way...the special effects in those old films were BETTER than in Van Helsing)<br/><br/>The action isn't really all that exciting. Part of the problem is that overuse of CGI...what's the fun in watching two animated characters doing battle with one another? Add to that just about every movement in the action scenes being telegraphed beforehand and you have a real lack of excitement(oh, look, wonder why those chains are there...gee, he's swinging from another on).<br/><br/>The script is extremely poorly written. When half the theater is laughing at what's obviously intended to be the most poignant scene in the film, it's not a good thing. Especially where they're groaning at all the (attempts at) humor. And what, exactly, killed one character? Heart attack? They even manage to make Dracula into the only really sympathetic character in the film...and I'm not sure Van Helsing isn't a serial killer.<br/><br/>On top of that, EVERY BIT of mythology about vampires and werewolves is completely thrown out the window. <br/><br/>This movie is just beyond bad. The only people who should see this are people who really love bad movies like Plan 9 and Battlefield Earth."

","Huge Hugh Jackman fan, I have to say that first.  Why did the movie have to stink?  The film was obnoxiously melodramatic (ex. Beckinsale's hair tosses and running sequences were annoying).  I sometimes found it hard to understand what Dracula was saying.  His brides were absurd; posturing, screeching and moaning excessantly.  The special effects were amazing, however dizzying.  The film did pay homage to the horror films of old: the opening scenes featuring the creation of Frankenstein's monster shot in black and white.  Although most of the film was well, ""over the top"". Hugh, however, did the best he could with what he had before him.  I would recommend the film to Hugh Jackman fans, for everyone else; wait for the DVD."

","If you like having your eyes relentlessly pounded with special effects for an hour and a half then you may possibly think Val Helsing is a satisfactory movie. Personally i was bored to death. The worst film i've seen at the cinema since queen of the damned. Now i'm a lover of special effects but not when they are grossley overused to overcompensate for a complete lack of story. I really am struggling to believe what i have just witnessed - the scenery, the effects, the costumes - must have took so long and cost so much. Instead of being impressed it just makes me think, ""what a dreadful waste!"" Not even hot vampire chicks could save this stinker!<br/><br/>The acting was bad, it wasn't scary or funny, the characters i didn't even remotely care for - infact i didn't care about anything i saw on the screen throughout.<br/><br/>And its the little things that really annoy me. I like some realism in fantasy - the vampires in this movie morph into nudity and then morph back into clothes. Clothes aren't living flesh, clothes don't change into vampires and back!<br/><br/>What an utter rubbish film! You know the only people i can imagine liking this film are very young boys who love computer games because the whole film is like watching a computer game - non stop monsters and action. Sound exciting? Trust me on this one - it isn't!! It's just a piece of turd in fancy packaging trying to be a thorntons luxury truffle.

Ok ok so maybe Blood Moon comes close (that REALLY bad Australian horror movie that sent me walking after only 30 minutes...)...  Actually the reality is I haven't seen a $150 million dollar movie made worse than this.....  This takes the cake. Bad accents, bad acting, relatively ok CGI but chronically noticeable CGI all the same...awful awful awful.  Admittedly Hugh Jackman was ok, but my god the rest of it is atrocious.

There are several contradictory stories about Dracula from the movies from comedy ot tragedy.  They are all true to Braham Stoker's novel.  This is a good movie for Haloweene time.

"Tony43","Null","0","1","18 May 2004"," Bloody bore
","There really isn't too much good to say about this flick. The action was virtually non stop, so non stop that it made this two hour film seem to be four hours long. It would have worked a little better if a little more thought had gone into things like story development and PACING.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale acquit themselves well, for what they get to do, which is damn little.<br/><br/>Richard Roxburgh, who plays Dracula does not, coming off as rather bland in comparison to the two men most associated with Vampire roles. Call him camp if you will, but Bela Lagosi did a much better job and so did Chistopher Lee. They both had personality enough to make them interesting antagonists. This vampire was more a copy of one of those super villains that populate James Bond movies. He was never believable, nor particularly interesting. A guy whose only goal is to suck the blood out of you so he can go on living turns out to be far more interesting than a meglamanic who wants to rule the world. Who woulda thunk it? The answer is, anyone who understands drama would have.<br/><br/>But the James Bondian villain angle leads to the big problem with this film and so many other big budget Hollywood films these days. When you lay out $170 million or something to produce and market a film like this, you try to cover your bets and I guess the best way to do that these days, beyond the computer graphics and the over hyped sound track, is to copy things that have been successful before.<br/><br/>So they dreamed up this Ven Helsing guy (actually stolen from old Universal monster movies) and copied his character from James Bond movies. They copied the opening sequence from the original ""Frankenstein"" film (but tried to pawn it off as a loving tribute). They copied the three flying wives of Dracula from just about ever World War Two war movie ever made in which Japanese Zeros attacked a defenseless village. They copied the the chamber where the baby Draculas were incubating from the ""Alien"" movies.<br/><br/>They probably copied a lot of the action from other current movies, but I rarely go to see them, so I can't cite the source.<br/><br/>But from what I can figure, the largest budget item in the production package must have been for tracing paper, because they copied an awful lot.<br/><br/>They didn't spend much on the script though, because there was virtually zero character development. Of course, these stories don't exactly revolve around character development. They are pretty much targeted at a poorly educated, over stimulated youth market that drifts from one cheap thrill movie to another week after week. And Marx thought religion was the opiate of the people!<br/><br/>Overall, this one was a big waste of time. Go back and look at those old Universal monster movies and you'll have a much better time."

I believe this is a great movie, but it should only be viewed by older children and adults.  Ages 13 and up like the ratings says.

But these don't disturb the overall flow (such as it is).  The characters are engaging.  I'll see anything for Hugh Jackman anyway.  Kate Beckinsale has really proven herself as an action heroine (she can now be forgiven for ""Pearl Harbor"").  Richard Roxburgh plays a campy, but very Lugosi, Dracula.  And all the supporting characters do an excellent job as well (the Brides, Carl, Frankenstein's Monster, etc.)  Even the effects weren't too bad, and they're a tremendous improvement over ""The Scorpion King,"" so Sommers should be congratulated.

","What a disappointment ... My high expectations for this latest Hugh Jackman film have been dashed.  I think the director could not decide what to do with this subject.  It started out campy, progressed into cartoon-like overdone special effects, and tried to throw in romance along the way.  It failed on all levels.  The characters are cardboard cutouts, unbelievable as action heroes, and uninteresting.  Did anyone else think that the characters of the Transylvanian siblings were straight out of a soap opera?

Don't listen to the REVIEWS, go see it and DECIDE for yourself.  It is an AWESOME way to kick off the summer movie season!  One more thing, try not too blink too much during this movie-if you blink you WILL MISS SOMETHING."

"rixrex","Null","0","1","12 May 2004"," Hypertensive, overblown and was done better several times already.
","Much too much of everything except good plot and characterization.  Peter Cushing is still the best Van Helsing, and Christopher Lee the most believable energetic Dracula, and Lugosi cannot be beat for suave and subtle sex appeal. This new Dracula didn't know whether to be Lugosi or Lee, and the whole sub-plot of Vlad the Impaler is thrown away. The wolfmen (there are three) try to bring pathos to their curse, but Chaney, Jr and Oliver Reed both did it better.  And remember when the Frankenstein monster was the most fearsome creature in the Universal arsenal, not some weak sister as portrayed here, a complete waste, typically following Universal's attempts to make this monster a kiddy attraction. They forgot that the creature was fearsome when he had the mind of a murderer. This was all done better in House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula, where the climax in those two films was the re-animation of the Frankenstein monster, feared by all and second to no other supernatural creature. The werewolf/vampire battle looks like a rip-off of Howling 6: the Freaks, where it was also done better and on a smaller budget.  And for well-written, well-acted, and literate monster film making, clearly the Hammer films still are the best and likely will be for many years to come.  Let's hope that they don't dust off the Creature from the Black Lagoon for this type of re-make!"

","Van Helsing starts off well enough with an homage to the classic Frankenstein film starring Boris Karloff, but it all goes horribly, horribly wrong.<br/><br/>
It is a basic James Bond style plot, with supernatural monsters subsituting as international terrorists, and with Mr. Jackman/Van Helsing playing the role of Mr. Bond.<br/><br/>The Blowfeld of the movie, Dracula couldn't have been worse if they tried. It was so over the top, I found that in scenes that were supposed to be scary/shocking I found myself giggling and rolling my eyes uncontrolablally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kate Bekinsdale (sp?) was alright.  Her accent wanted to make me gag, but it wasn't the worst Romainan accent I've heard, just the cheeziest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The worse part of the film was the anti-climactic, climax.  They set  up the plot up around Van Helsing's missing memories (Wolveriene anyone?) and then they really fail to reveal the suprise.  How does Dracula Know Van H?  Not really sure, they ellude to some kind of religious connection, but fail to state it explicity, therefore making the climax just fall flat on its face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Good.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was David Wenham's portrayal of the sidekick/Friar Carl.

","The film was most disappointing to one who is a horror connoisseur.  I am a man of 44 years and my first horror film I viewed when I was 5 years old in New York City called The Horror of Dracula with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  Peter Cushing would roll over in his grave.  As everyone knows he was the best Van Helsing the business has ever seen, hence Hammer Productions.  This film was an abomination.  I just hope Christopher Lee doesn't go to see this film.  The gentlemen who portrayed Dracula was insubstantial.  Lon Chaney Jr. played the role better when he was Count Alucard (now that's Dracula spelled backwards).  For 6 months I looked forward to seeing this film.  I have wasted 26 good dollars.  The only time the make-up and special effect shone was the last fight between Dracula and the werewolf.  Where was Rick Baker on this film?  You should have spent the bucks and went with Rick.  Not only Dracula, Van Helsing was ineffective too.  When will Hollywood get this right?  It has been a long time since 1979 and Frank Langella's Dracula.  Even the master Lawrence Olivier's blind walk-through on Langella's film as Van Helsing made your film look very pale, good sirs."

This is a dinamic romp, winking at the best action movies ever made, with a lead character who is a mix of Indiana Jones and James Bond (mostly the latter), and we have a very good looking (can I say gorgeous?) heroine, a classic villain who as usual steal the scene with the better jokes of the movie, and a bunch of other characters, that are as usual thin as paper but normally fun or really beautiful (the vampire brides are as usual very beatiful). In this respect the movie is good, probably only a little too long and too similar to a comic book adaptation (but it is better than the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).

","I REALLY tried to like this movie, for the sake of Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and David Wenham, all of whom I absolutely adore.<br/><br/>
But in all honesty, there were only two things that kept me from falling asleep: the special effects and Carl (David Wenham's character). I happen to be a Lord of the Rings fan, so I was thrilled to see him in a comedic role (similar in some ways to his Audrey in Moulin Rouge). He is by far the most amusing character in this film and the only comic relief from the crappy story line.<br/><br/>The plot was more than a bit lacking. It was slow moving, and I had really expected it to pick up at one point, but it didn't. Half the movie was Van Helsing and Anna (Kate's character) deciding how to kill Dracula.<br/><br/>

(Spoilers Ho!)<br/><br/>Dialogue - Surely one of the first rules of movie making must be to avoid pointlessly reminding people what happened ten minutes ago/ will happen ten minutes later? Again and again we get smacked with the reminders... must of the verbal gags are amusing, but then we lead into another problem...<br/><br/>Dracula - Sorry, sorry, I wanted to like him as a bad guy, I really did. I wanted to believe he was actually evil, I wanted to believe he was at least a bit more than your stereotypical 'I vant to suck your blood' stock vampire, but Richard Roxburgh wouldn't let me do it, and though I found one line of his pretty funny, and I'm certain it was what he was given in the script rather than him himself... He was good as far as it went, but you wonder if Roxburgh + better script could have done so much more...<br/><br/>Ending - for those of us who have seen it I think thats nuff said...

It really is. I mean, go and see this film just for an education in how to never make a film- its a laugh from start to end- its just a shame it never meant to be one, or at least, if it did, it should make it more obvious.<br/><br/>Basically, Van Helsing is an incredible parody of films like LXG, but it doesn't actually seem to be trying to be a parody. All the actors, and the director seem to take their job far too seriously. So basically, you have a choice- accept it as a comedy, or try and accept it as a drama.

"rosscinema","4","0","1","16 May 2004"," Outlandish, to say the least
","I grew up watching the Universal horror films and when I heard that they were making this I had the suspicion that I was going to be disappointed. I guess I'm from the old school where I prefer original make-up over CGI effects and many times during my viewing of this I thought I was watching a Warner Bros. cartoon. Story is about monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who works for the Vatican and he is told that Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) is in Transylvania causing trouble but first though he goes to the Notre Dame cathedral and kills Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing takes an inventive Friar named Carl (David Wenham) along with him and when they arrive in Transylvania they are almost attacked by the local villagers but some flying vampiresses swoop down and he manages to kill one. He meets Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) who has been fighting Dracula and his brides as well and later Van Helsing learns that her brother Velkan (Will Kemp) is actually the Wolf Man. <br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Dracula has been searching for Frankenstein's Monster (Shuler Hensley) so that he can learn the secrets of creation and bring his own offspring to life. Along with the Wolf Man and his brides Dracula has Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) to help him and after Van Helsing and Anna find The Monster they set out to get him. Van Helsing gets bit by the Wolf Man and in two days the moon will be full so now they must hurry to stop Dracula's plans.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Stephen Sommers who did the ""Mummy"" films and while he genuinely brings tons of energy to his films there are just too many CGI effects for my taste. The whole film is so cartoonish and silly that it goes way over the top and there isn't a scary moment in the film. Jackman looks like he rummage through the wardrobe department from ""Indiana Jones"" and found the right getup to wear and Beckinsale looks like a Victoria Secret model with her corset. Also, Beckinsale demonstrates so many flips that she would be a cinch to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Wenham as Carl is the comic relief and he has the best lines in the film like after the Wolf Man jumps out of a window he asks ""Why does it smell like wet dog""? And why do the werewolves in this film have the ability to crawl up walls like a lizard and be able to jump like a grasshopper? Dracula wants to bring his offspring to life but they are in cocoons. Why are they in cocoons and how does the living dead mate? Roxburgh as Dracula is especially hammy and along with Beckinsale you have to chuckle at the attempts at a Romanian accent. The part of the film about the Monster I found a little more interesting but he's so chatty! Frankenstein's Monster speaks better than most people today and he seems equipped to be an English teacher. The last 20 minutes of this film is so silly and drenched in CGI effects that it ceases to be a film and instead is more animated. The Monster and Beckinsale spend most of the last 20 minutes swinging on cables like Spiderman and Beckinsale's character is thrown and tossed like a rag doll and there is no way she could keep getting up. As old as the original films are they still have more impressive special effects and are genuinely scarier but if someone told me they liked this as just escapism and entertainment I wouldn't argue. But for me it's just utter nonsense and completely outlandish and over the top and I still recommend the old Universal horror films over this."

"PlutonicLove","Null","0","1","9 May 2004"," What the Helsing?
","Alan Silvestri has graced us with innumerable sublime scores, from the heroic, fanfare-heavy `Back to the Future' to the strikingly simple `Forest Gump' to the sprightly, jovial `Mousehunt' to the propulsive, percussion-driven powerhouse `Predator.' His work ranges from the divinely subtle to the outlandishly epic, but rarely is it ever intrusive or over the top. Consequently, when he feels the need to violently pummel me with snare drums, I instantly know something is wrong. Well, of course Silvestri's score for `Van Helsing' is obnoxiously loud - it has to compete with piercing vampire screams, earsplitting thunder, and enough creaks, crashes and explosions to destroy any surround system. I can only suppose director Steven Sommers (`The Mummy,' `The Mummy Returns,' `The Mummy Forever,' `The Mummy and Robin' and, of course `Abbot and Costello Meet The Scorpion King') figured this would be the only way to keep his audience awake. Hell, Van Helsing's (Hugh Jackman) heroic theme even blasts at full force while he is leisurely strolling to Paris while adjusting his hat.<br/><br/>No matter. After finishing his assignment in Paris (featuring a brief cameo by Mr. Hulk, of `Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hulk' fame), Van Helsing returns to the Vatican to have a long chat with the Italian Basil Exposition, Cardinal Esposizione Del Basilico (Alun Armstrong, overacting with zeal). As Van Helsing apparently suffers from both short- and long-term memory loss, Basilico spends most of his time reiterating their shared past, then assigns him to travel to Transylvania in order to guard princess Anna Valerious (anorexic Kate Beckinsale, dressed in a mildly fetishistic leather and cotton outfit), the last surviving member of her ancient, vampire-hunting family. Turns out one of her ancestors stupidly promised God that he and his unfortunate relations would neither rest nor enter heaven until Dracula was defeated. ""In retrospect, an obvious mistake,"" Basilico quips. Thus Helsing now must make sure that the poor dope's family won't be lost in purgatory.<br/><br/>Friar Carl, played by David Wenham of `SeaChange' fame, aids Van Helsing in this debatable quest by supplying him with daylight grenades directly out of Guillermo Del Toro's `Blade 2,' spinning razors, silver bullets, holy water and a rapid-fire crossbow with a seemingly endless supply of ammunition. (Now, it should be pointed out that nowhere in Bram Stoker's classic novel -- or its many cinematic adaptations -- does Van Helsing use anything even remotely like this crossbow, but it has long been hypothesized by reputable literary scholars that he was in fact modeled after an oddball historical personage by the name of Wilberforce H.K. Smithington who may have used something like it.) Before I forget, judging from his affected British accent Wenham is under the regrettable delusion that he is providing voice-over for Pino Van Lamsweerde's `Asterix in Britain.' ""It was a real doddle copping down here to Transylvania, what what? Just smashing,"" one can almost hear him say.<br/><br/>Still, in terms of sheer ludicrousness none of the above can even compare to Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his brides (three obnoxious Maxim models). Roxburgh's performance is obviously modeled after both the Count from `Sesame Street' and an Ed Wood-era Bela Lugosi. ""Beware,"" Dracula warns. ""Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep. He eats little boys... puppy dog tails, big fat snails. Beware. take care."" Later, he demonstrates how a vampire eats a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. ""I like to eat the peanut butter first,"" he exclaims, leaving deep tooth marks in the drained chocolate cup. Meanwhile his wives unanimously pretend to be in a Joel Schumacher film. When they're not gesticulating wildly or turning into androgynous, Marilyn Manson-like flying Barbie dolls, they boast even worse accents than Dracula, taunting and playing with Valerious in what `Ebert's Bigger Little Movie Glossary' refers to as the ""Fallacy of the Talking Killer."" Helsing and Valerious might as well have fought three Jar Jar Binkses instead. ""Your blahd vill keep me beautiful forever,"" Bride #3 sneers. ""Vat do you zink about zat?"" Valerious replies: ""If you're going to kill someone, do it. Don't just stand there talking about it."" Apparently, she's a fan of `The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', where Tuto utters the similar, famous line ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk."" Or perhaps director Steven Sommers was a little too aware of the fact that the brides could have easily killed Valerious 20 minutes into the film, but instead opted to merely lick her face, ala `The Relic.'<br/><br/>Ah, but the many `homages' don't end there. Besides the aforementioned films, Sommers pilfers scenes from `Return of the Jedi' (Luke burning Vader's remains and the following metaphysical appearance of Anakin, Obi Wan and Yoda), `Raiders of the Lost Ark' (the desert chase, where Indy's private parts come dangerously close to the wheels of the truck), `Speed' (the bus jumping the bridge), `The Lion King' (Simba's father in the sky), `Twister' (a cow being tossed around for comic effect), `The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (`The bells, the bells!') and of course the Bond franchise (Q, a rip-off so obvious that it has been pointed out by every single reviewer on the web). Also, he recycles plot devices from his own films, such as the illustration explaining how to kill the monster, a device used in `The Mummy Returns,' and Kevin J. O'Connor's performance as Igor, identical to Joey `Tooch' Pantucci from `Deep Rising' and Beni Gabor from the first `Mummy.'<br/><br/>
Oh, and of course there's the rope swinging, reminiscent of both `Tarzan' and `Spider-Man.' Never in my life have I seen this much rope swinging in utter defiance of all known physics. Almost every major character, even (I am not making this up!) the Frankenstein monster, gets to swing hundreds of feet across canyons and ravines, smashing safely through windows or against walls without ever suffering any visible harm -- ""Pull the strings,"" Dracula yells. ""Pull the strings!"" At one time Valerious falls hundreds of feet, smashes against several ropes on the way, gets electrocuted, and is still able to catch the edge of a bridge, holding on with one hand. This makes me wonder why she hasn't considered simply strapping on an ACME jet backpack instead? And why, I must ask, didn't Friar Carl supply Van Helsing with an oversized magnet?<br/><br/>Incidentally, does anyone remember those mildly amusing yogurt commercials from the early '90s where people would eat a ""heavy"" sandwich and consequently fall through the floor? The exact same thing happens to Van Helsing and Velerious here, except that the sandwich has been replaced by absinthe. Yup, there's nothing funnier than people falling through shoddy floors! Of course, the floor doesn't even mess up our heroes' hair. This makes me wonder. is Van Helsing immortal? Or is he just ageless? Sommers seems to hint at the fact that Helsing is in fact archangel Gabriel, the left hand of God, and was present at the battle of Masada. What the hell is that all about? And why does Dracula keep werewolves around if they're the only ones who can kill him? And. vampire baby bats? (""One, one bat! Two, two bats! Hahahah!"") And what the hell are those mole-men working in Dracula's laboratory? And why does the coach catch on fire when struck by a wolfman? And why does Dracula dress like a Flamenco instructor? And won't Frankenstein starve to death, stranded at sea on that ridiculous raft? And . oh, never-frickin'-mind!<br/><br/>I'm not even going to get started on the abysmal special effects on display here. Let's just say they're not nearly as convincing as Bert I.

","I saw this film yesterday and I have to say it was not as brilliant as I had expected but still very enjoyable film. The overall storyline and action was great but there was a few moments that let it down.<br/><br/>SPOILERS The script was good but i found there were a few bad or out of character lines. one of those was, towards the end, when dracula was backing away from van helsing/werewolf and saying something like ""maybe we could be friends"" i found this to be very cheesy and unlike the evil dracula from the rest of the film. Another thing i didn't like was the fact that a few things were not explained fully (although that may just have been me not paying attention). there were also a few cheesy bits like van helsing jumping off the carriage and firing two guns in slow mo.<br/><br/>but there were plenty of things i did like about the film. David Wenham was great as the comedy friar and had a lots of funny lines (""I don't know if you've looked in the mirror lately, but you kind of stick out in a crowd."") hugh jackman was good as the dark hero, although i'm not sure what accent he was ment to be doing and kate beckinsale was feisty and sometimes a little bit vulnerable so that van helsing got a chance to come and save her (but i still have no idea how she managed to run or fight in that corset). the opening black and white scene was brilliant and a great way to start the film. i also thought the way frankenstein was portrayed was good. the action scenes were great i loved hugh jackman jumping from horse to horse. the CGI baby vampires (and the CGI big vampires for that matter) looked scarily realistic although they sort of reminded me of the flying monkeys from the wizard of oz. it was not a particularly frightening film but there were a few bits that really made me jump like Mr hyde suddenly appearing from the top of the screen.<br/><br/>Over all i give it 8/10"

","Wow, let me tell you, Van Helsing has got to be the most action-packed thrill ride I have ever seen! I absolutely loved Steven Sommer's The Mummy and the Mummy Returns, because the action, plot, and even hints of comedy made the movie extremely fun. Actually, I was skeptical about Van Helsing when I first saw the preview. It looked like another monster movie that jams too much into it, with nothing exciting and fresh about it. I was doubtful that one movie could have all these famous monsters, and have them make a classic movie. I was wrong! This movie was awesome! Combined with the best special effects I have seen since LOTR, a cool and interesting plot line, and even cooler characters, Van Helsing is a must-see movie this May. I especially liked Anna Valerious, and her ""I dont need any help"" attitude. Trying to grab and throw any weapon available at her nemesis, Dracula, was something that made me laugh. It reminds me of The Mummy Returns when Evie is trying to drag a bench in front of the museum doors to block the dead warriors from getting to them, and Rick says ""Honey, what are you doing? These guys don't use doors!"" And the warriors bust out of the walls, frightening them both. I hope this was even the littlest bit helpful on deciding to see the movie, because I know I'm going to see it over and over!"

","Some had a cool idea for a movie, but definitely pitched it to the wrong people. Oh wait, the guy that had the idea for the movie wrote the script. Which leads me to one conclusion: Sommers should have stopped writing movies after The Mummy Returns, at the latest. This movie had so much potential, but was wasted on terrible scripting, and way too much CGI. And not even good CGI. They should have just done the whole thing in CGI, a la Final Fantasy (even though I didn't much care for that movie, either). The only humor came from seeing David Wenham go from Faramir to a dorky, horny... friar? I forget what he was, even though he made the same joke about it twice. The second time was the funnier. The love interested between Jackman and Beckinsale was sophmoric at best. All in all, I thought it was lame. But hey, I work in a theater, and some kid saw it three times in a row, so to each his own, as they say."

The basic flaw with the whole thing is the fact that the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. First it was a comedy, then a special effects extravaganza, then an action movie, then a horror movie and finally a love story. Only problem is, it really is none of them. I found it very hard to care about anything that was happening on the screen.

"sleepyelf","Null","0","1","8 May 2004"," Next time, proofread the script.
","I watched Van Helsing tonight. I felt like it wasn't even the final release of the movie. One problem that you have when you are the writer and director of the movie is that you can't quite see when your writing is terrible. Sadly, this problem was in full force in this movie. Now, I'm willing to suspend disbelief to allow for Vampires and Werewolves and the like, and even allow for the changes to the legend of vampires, but to totally destroy the plainest laws of continuity and nature? This I cannot tolerate. For example: we see a scene where our brave heroes are at the bottom of a tower. It is snowing. Meanwhile, more than 300 feet up, it is raining. This does not compute.<br/><br/>The story terrorizes us with loose ends, never quite explaining how some characters ever came to be what they are. The movie glides forward on its special effects and terrible, terrible acting. When we first meet Count Dracula at the beginning of the movie, I was hoping so dearly that he died early on so I wouldn't have to hear his poorly coached accent any more. To be fair, though, Hugh Jackman was his same badass self all over again.<br/><br/>This movie, my girlfriend told me, was not good, but was cool. I encourage you not to believe this mistake. If you want a movie that is cool but maybe not the best, go watch The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, or Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Or maybe even go rent a good one that's also cool, like Minority Report. Don't waste your money on this one. Wait for video. And even then, have your friend rent it."

Unfortunately, I've just enumerated all the reasons for seeing this movie.<br/><br/>I went into this movie hoping to see a decent action/horror flick, light on plot, and was surprised to find that the movie didn't live up to even those meager expectations. Van Helsing never seems to be in mortal danger at any point in the movie, which left me with a ""Who cares?"" attitude throughout. The arch-villain, Dracula, is something of a wimp, who spends most of his time letting his wives do his dirty-work while he sits around various castles and walks on the ceiling.<br/><br/>Besides seeing the breathtaking Kate Beckinsale in a swashbuckling outfit, the only other bright spot to the film was the performance of David Wenham as Friar Carl. Wenham shows his acting abilities as he goes from the proud but troubled Faramir in Lord of the Rings to the stooped, studious, witty and faithful sidekick in Van Helsing.<br/><br/>If you want an action/horror flick, in which you can drool over Kate Beckinsale, go see Underworld. If you want a loud action movie with gadgets, gizmos, supernatural powers, and great special effects, go watch or re-watch the X-Men movies.

The plot is non-existent, the dialogue is awful, and the way the dialogue is presented by the actors is monotone and disjointed. Every bad movie cliche can be found in one form or another in this film. The plot just doesn't make sense, and it seems that the writer (Stephen Sommers) came to a couple points and didn't know how to get out of them, so some bizarre realization was made and everything worked out.  The chemistry between the hero and heroine is also non-existent, and the progression of their relationship is both confusing, forced and therefore, unbelievable.

","Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (known for movies such as `The Mummy' and its successful sequel) one would expect `Van Helsing' to run along similar lines as its predecessors.  Unfortunately, this next installment in the Sommers Saga, somehow does not live up to standards set by the previous hits.  The main characters in the film appeared to be one-dimensional adaptations made for the popcorn/ bubblegum audiences that Hollywood counts on for Box Office success.  Whilst this formula seemed to work on `the Mummy', there is something missing of the '6 parts Action, 4 parts Comedy, 3 parts Horror and 1 part Romance' recipe of preceding attempts.<br/><br/>Dracula was portrayed as a garish, over-the-top revision of a character whose infamy had once made him one of the more feared creatures of literature.  Here, he felt to me simply as a cartoon version of the real nature of what many of us will recognize.  His Brides on the other hand were irritating - I'd always come to think them as being frightening, yet seductive beings, being the underworlds representation of sirens.  Here they are bad actresses disguised (poorly) by computer generated images, worse dialogue, and terrible accents.<br/><br/>That being said, the title character himself was quite delightful to watch. Van Helsing's comedic talent, cavalier attitude and general Byron-esque heroic tendencies did leave this audience member rather pleased.  However, due to Jackman's earlier movie choices in X-men and X-men 2, the similarities in Van Helsing and Wolverine were of course made - no spoilers will be revealed here, suffice to say that the drums of imminent misfortune play faintly in the background.<br/><br/>His love interest, played by the stunning Kate Beckinsale, is simply that - a love interest played by a captivating i-am-so-ballsy-stay-out-of-my-way sidekick.  A woman, who one might add, doesn't wear very appropriate clothing for wintry conditions.  There's comedic relief, in the form of Van Helsing's Little Helper (a.k.a. Carl - played by the talented David Wenham!) who I must admit got a few laughs out of me.  Other peripheral characters were much the same, that is, they were the stereotyped clichés that we are all accustomed to seeing.  The addition of further literary legends was a little absurd - Dr Jekyll/ Mr. Hyde for example?  Why is he involved here? Confusion abounds.<br/><br/>All things considered, the film was relatively enjoyable, if by enjoyable you mean a night out where judgment and any reliable thought process must be left at the bathroom sink.  It delivered large doses of action and broad comedy followed closely by a few startled gasps (ok, maybe not a few). After all, what more can you expect?  This is Hollywood, where the men are men, and dollar signs rule their world.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/5"

The movie tries very hard to weave together subplots and to build some amount of compassion for the characters but fails miserably. Comparisons to last year's equally disappointing League of Extraordinary Gentlemen are not far off. Both films lack substance and rely mainly on flashy visuals and predictible stories to occupy their audience's time. A lone high is the film's opening, which only serves to make the rest of the movie an even bigger disappointment.

","You'd think it would be impossible for Stephen Sommers to sink lower than the cinematic abomination that was The Mummy Returns, but somehow, he's done it - this endless barrage of phony CGI effects is a tough slog to get through. The effects (particularly the animation of Dracula's brides and the werewolves) are atrocious, but the shockingly poor animation of Mr Hyde at the beginning made the Hyde from League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen seem like Gollum. This basically comes off as a poor mans League, right down to Richard Roxburgh prancing about as a hammy villian. Hugh Jackman is okay, but less charismatic than usual - and Kate Beckinsale is wasted in a role that again requires her to do little more than pout and look pretty (that's pretty much all she did in Pearl Harbor and Underworld). But it's really Sommers who should take the blame for this - relying too much CGI and ridiculous action scenes that never seem remotely real (especially the carriage chase scene) that you really don't care.

I think they should have saved some of those characters for other movies like they would with a superhero movie. For example, in Batman the only villain was the Joker.  Not most of the villains he faces.  I think they should have changed a few things about the actual character of Van Helsing, (his age, reputation, etc.), and perhaps the amount of time they would take between parts of the story.

","Stephen Sommers latest is an attempt to profit in the line previously taken by ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" but, of course, with a twist. (I may mention a couple of **spoilers** but this movie is spoiled on origin).<br/><br/>Van Helsing (the mythical vampire killer of Bram Stoker´s Dracula) is sort of an immortal slayer searching for monsters (in the first minutes he does Mr. Hyde) to kill with weaponry a la James Bond for the nineteen century. He is cleverly sidekicked with a comic-relief frail to feed him with clever weapons for every season).<br/><br/>He meets Beckingsale, a sort of Rumanian warrior part of a clan fighting Dracula for centuries (which V.H. is sent to help to avoid 9 generations of her family skipping Heaven-as dumb as it sounds). Full of CGI and a plot so contrived that keeps the audience laughing where it attempts to thrill, this idiotic mishmash is a definite must avoid for anyone with enough braincells to read the title.<br/><br/>Dracula and his women have caves full of ""eggs"" (suspiciously looking like ALIEN cocoons) and are looking for the way for them to live, so they all can dominate the earth (it's never clear why they just don't simply bite a few thousand peasants to populate the region with vampires), and they somehow understand that by using Dr.Frankenstein's machine with a werewolf they can canalize electricity into the ugly cocoons to spawn a few thousand little green demons (that look like suspiciously like the gargoiles from the Hunchback of Notre Dame). The mummy was bad, but was popcorn-watchable-if-you-don't-have-anything-else-to-do, he has gone beyond: this is his worst yet, but we must wonder if his next: Van Helsing II: the mummy of the Louvre, won't go further down."

The film is a showcase of special FX, loud music and handsomely looking set pieces all put together in a ""mish mash"" of a movie. The only original thing in it is the fact that nobody had ripped off so many other films before...OK, fine, let's all call it an ""homage"" to the old ""monsters movies""... but I have to say, as a lover of those films, this one didn't really cut it for me. Am I really too old for this? But then again, everybody else seemed to love ""The Mummy"" and its lousy sequel, so I guess they will all flock to see this too. It certainly looks expensive for most of its length (20 minutes too long, by the way) and the CGI work in places is some of the most impressive I've seen recently (but Mr Hyde is just as bad as the HULK was last summer)... I just wish they could also spend some money in making sure that the audience cared a little bit more about what's going on the screen. The story is really thin and the dialogue is almost non-existent while the comic relives are so few that when they come you almost forget you're supposed to laugh (in fact in the theatre where I was, nobody ever did!). Having said that, I can see a sequel coming up pretty soon. So who's next? Let's bet: the mummy, the monster of the blue lagoon, the invisible man? The Smurfs?

It's obvious that the ""writer/director"" (I use those words because technically that was what Stephen Sommers was hired to do) had nothing but contempt for those films, and a complete misunderstanding of what makes those films work, or he couldn't have possibly made this film based on them. He gave Frankenstein's creation the power of speech to make him a whining self martyring pain in the ass. Vampires can walk around in the day time. A werewolf would turn back into a human if there is passing cloud cover over the moon, no really cloud cover, a Vampire hunter who can shoot hundreds of arrows and not hit a moving target in the heart, another vampire hunter who never carries stakes or any weapon that can destroy a vampire and cannot fend off a vampire by herself, and a village full of people living under the constant threat of being a vampire's next meal, who when they hear the sound of hundreds of beating wings at night, go outside en masse to see what's there!"

"Jonnyok98ub","1","0","1","5 May 2004"," Typical Garbage with Too Much CG
","I never thought I would say this, but this is perhaps one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time; it is actually worse in many respects than New York Minute.  The major problem with Van Helsing is that in some ways is in the expectations, which are mainly due to the over-advertising we've been bombarded by since the Super Bowl.  This is one of those May releases that everyone gets excited for, and every time you turn on the TV you either catch an ad for it, or one of its immensely attractive stars sitting comfortably on Jay Leno's couch, discussing how amazing an experience it was to make this movie.  I wish that experience had translated over to the audience I was sitting with.<br/><br/>Van Helsing fails because there is really no reason to watch it.  The whole movie is an excuse to do CG, and every place that you could possibly conceive of having a CG image, Van Helsing gives you two.  This film seems like what watching a really high strung individuals daydreams would be like: nothing is static, nothing is developed, everything is constantly in motion, and by the end, you just feel sick to your stomach.  The main plot, and I will try not to simplify it too much, is as follows: Gabriel Van Helsing works for a secret agency in Rome that kills monsters.  He has to travel to Transylvania to help save a family from Purgatory.  Action ensues, attractive people share screen time, there are tons and tons of CG effects, convenient plot twists occur, and the movie ends.  In between these `plot points', we are treated to average action augmented with an incredible amount of average CG.  I felt like I was watching a movie on the Sci-Fi channel about crocodiles that kill babies or something, because the effects are so below average they become honestly distracting.  If there was a plot, and I'm pretty sure there wasn't one, I was so distracted by the bad CG and lack of real environments that I just completely missed it.<br/><br/>The acting is average, although a little bit more hammy and fun than I had expected.  For a movie that looks this dark and has this much action, trying to recreate The Mummy was not a wise idea.  What made The Mummy work was the actors really being interested in playing these characters out, as well as the characters themselves being funny and interesting.  The characters in Van Helsing are flat, uninteresting, and seem to be going through the movie on `bad action film' rails.  There are some ups, downs, but mostly this ride just makes you feel sick.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I can't even enjoy this film as a campy throwback to an older era, where films were actually made on soundstages and sets had to be constructed.  The physical reality of movie making used to inhibit the imagination of these wild directors, in that their visions had to be tempered to what was possible.  This would result in excellent compromises between reality and fantasy, and would also force filmmakers to focus on characters as opposed to scenery.  Nowadays, with computers, most filmmakers are not limited in their imaginations, and it all pours out onto the screen like so much vomit into an airplane toilet.  After awhile, I just don't care about `cool' or `being impressed', and this film was trying to do both with CG.  If you want to make a good movie, focus on the characters and the story.  If those are strong, CG can really help, and not be such a distraction.<br/><br/>3 out of 10"

","*MINOR SPOILERS*<br/><br/>What do you get when you take a woeful script, an incoherent story and a bucket load of special effects?  Why, it must be Van Helsing!<br/><br/>In the interest of fairness, I'll start with what I liked about this movie. The visuals is striking and the production design outstanding.  Every set is suitably moody and atmospheric.  The special effects are the real star of the show, no surprises there, and are beautifully done.  I suspect, however, that this has something to do with the fact that virtually every scene takes place in near darkness and that hides a multitude of sins.  The action is also outstanding- the stunt work is well done and there are a couple of great set pieces.<br/><br/>However, this is not enough.  Much has been made of how bad the script is and unfortunately it is truly appalling- the actors founder with characters lacking any depth or chemistry.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale have both been better.  Kate's career has been on a steady downer since Pearl Harbour- does this girl have a thing for overblown, special effects laden tripe where she gets to wear tight costumes or what?  And as for Hugh, there were a couple of points where I got the feeling he was going to nod off and go to sleep.  His job was to look surly, wield impressive weapons (Freud would have a field day here) and occasionally come out with the sort of droll one liners that would be better placed in the next Die Hard movie.  A mysterious guy with an anger management problem and no clue about his past? Gee, Hugh, where have we seen THAT before.<br/><br/>The supporting players fare no better.  David Wenham is wasted in the standard 'sidekick' role, Richard Roxborough chews scenery as Count Dracula and the less said about his brides the better- all three of them act from the cleavage and are about as frightening as a clown at a kid's birthday party.<br/><br/>I could go on- the story is all over the place and the finale leaves several loose ends untied.  Van Helsing's burning quest is to find out his origins. He doesn't.  This can mean only one thing- a sequel...or even worse, a franchise.  Yeesh.  <br/><br/>There are too many gaps in the plot, too many developments left unexplained. Why is Frankenstein's monster so critical?  Where exactly do the werewolves fit into to it all?  Yes, this is a monster movie, but too often things just seem to be inserted because they look cool rather than them having any relevance to the plot.  It all slaps of sloppy film making.  It's similiar in many ways to The Mummy, but unlike that movie, this is seriously lacking in humour.  The fun quotient just isn't there.<br/><br/>'What do you expect, it's only a popcorn flick' is the defense I've heard most often.  I'm sorry, but no.  I've seen enough examples of good popcorn flicks to know that some things are inexcusable.  Even action fans deserve good dialogue and a story that makes sense.  Pirates of the Caribbean is the example that most readily jumps to mind.  Even though there were several plot gaps there too, you were having too good a time to really notice.<br/><br/>Save your money.  Rent X-Men and Underworld, make it a double bill and call it a night."

I mean WHAT acting? There was a lot of over-acting though so if you're going by quantity and not quality she was perfect!

All of the negative comments I'd read before seeing it were disproved as far as I'm concerned. The score was great, the sound engineering fabulous, and overall the sound was no louder than any other action movie (Matrix anyone?). The CG was absolutely incredible. I went in knowing (from an interview with Stephen Sommers) that Frankenstein was entirely CG ALL the time, and was blown away to find that he looked and acted more real than a REAL Frankenstein (i.e. guy in a body suit) would look. I personally liked the lines that others are complaining about. They were comfortable, humorous, timely, well-delivered, and often sarcastic in just the right measure. This is one film that will be looked back on highly, but that some like to bash simply because it has all their favorite classic creatures in it but in a different context then some viewers like. It also is an unapologetically fun, playful film, and I appreciated the thrill ride it delivered. I also was not annoyed by the use of FX.<br/><br/>
All in all, I think it's far and away the best Stephen Sommers film EVER. I pretty much hated Return of the Mummy II - mostly because of the horrendous ""scorpion king"" CG at the end. But for the most part both Mummies were fun, but nearly as fun as Van Helsing. <br/><br/>So, lighten up guys. Don't be so arrogant as to think you're above this kind of fun film. You can't honestly tell me that you think the dialogue, story, and even CG were nearly as bad as they were in the Matrix trilogy. Granted, the Matrix trilogy got away with a passable story, and horrendous dialogue only because of its marvelous CG... <br/><br/>*sigh* I'm done ranting.

We were left shaking our heads in exasperation."

","You know how big budget American movies have this reputation of being bad (due to badly contrived plots, bad unrealistic affects, generic hero/heroin, obvious ending, eye candy that isn't all that sweet) yah that's the kind. Well this movie, let me tell you, is the KING of all the movies with that stereotype. Let me explain something first of all, this is NOT a review of Van Hellsing, maybe, one day, when I have nothing better to do I'll write one, today is not the day, however. Today is the day when I will simply say this is quite possibly the worst big budget action movie of its genre. The guy who did this was famous for the Mummy. Personally I feel the Mummy was good (ok, so the second was bad but still) THIS, however well let's put it this way, the first 5 min are good. The second color filters into the movie it goes downhill. And just when it hits the bottom and you know it can't get worse, it starts borrowing into the ground to get even lower. I would like to also stress that this movie has more plot holes that I noticed (upon one viewing only I might add) then all other movies I have ever seen (and I'v seen a lot) that, right there, should say something."

","At least it's not The Hulk. What else can be said? This was warm dog-doo served to look like a movie. The Hulk was cold dog-doo. This was an interesting premise twisted, contorted, turned into a bucket of vomit and thrown at you while you're standing chin deep in a vat of warm urine. The Hulk was cold urine. Summers needs to go to everyone who saw this apologize in person for what he did to the movie industry. He turned it back 50 years. The Hulk turned it back to before ""talkies"". I'm going to go rent Glitter now. Perhaps that will cleanse my palette. It's only redeeming quality was...now give me a minute...I can think of one - Hold on..."

","Let me start off ny saying that the minute I heard about the concept for this movie, I was against it. Learning that Abraham Van Helsing (the real Van Helsing) was being replaced with ""Gabriel"" was a small comfort. Right from the beginning, any source material was thrown straight out the window. Instead of investing any intrest in the main characters, I found myself rooting for the town undertaker/gravedigger who seemed to possess the innate ability to lead every Transylvanian mob. The only positive thing I could say about this movie is that the graphics involved in animating a flying vampiress/demoness have progressed greatly since the days of Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness. In fact, instead of wasting any of your money on this overblown piece of $#!*, go out and rent Army of Darkness. You'll get more that your money's worth with twice the plot! Seriously though, don't see Van Helsing unless you wish to indulge your inner masochist."

","I never thought I'd find a film to challenge Waterworld's seemingly unbeatable levels of drivel and inconsistency. If anyone was going to have a chance at that ""honour"" though I would have bet on Sommers and indeed he has plumbed new depths here.<br/><br/>There is really nothing good to say about this travesty at all. Who keeps green-lighting this ass-clowns films? The rest of Holywood must be ecstatic right now knowing they can't possible make the worst film of the year no matter how hard they try.<br/><br/>I hope Beckinsale and Jackman were well paid as this will do nothing but harm to both of them. Everyone else attached to this fiasco can probably rely on people's minds erasing their memories of it in self-preservation."

","Van Helsing is a popular character from literature, and indeed the movies. The arch-nemesis of Count Dracula, he has always been portrayed as a middle aged gentleman, with a few eccentricities (none more so than in Coppola's Dracula film when Anthony Hopkins played him as a total loon.)  Now, the character has been stolen and changed by Mummy writer and director, Stephen Sommers, to be portrayed as a younger action hero, who hunts not only the legendary Count but also every other supernatural monster which stalks the earth.  Much in the same way that other famous characters from literature were altered for The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen.<br/><br/>Every now and again, a film comes along which is designed to just be a popcorn' movie, putting bums on seats, and throwing action and adventure at you.  This, I think, is one of them.  If this wasn't the intention of Sommers, then he has made one heck of a turkey of a film! The plot is weak at the best of times, being that Dracula is using werewolves to hunt his enemies, whom he wants to use in Frankenstein type of experiments.  Van Helsing is sent by the Vatican to sort him out.  The dire-logue (sic) is awful, with really forced exposition done in a pantomime style (I resisted the urge to shout `He's behind you' on a few occasions), and this shows that Sommers is perhaps only slightly better at script writing than a certain George Lucas.  Sommers' last two films, Mummy and Mummy Returns, both suffered from the same sloppy writing, so the pattern is starting to show. However, Van Helsing isn't really a total disaster.  Despite the ropey acting and the terrible script, it is a success, in a `leave your brain, common sense, and desire for a good story at the door' kind of way.  Indeed the action comes so thick and fast that just as the tedious talky bits start to drag, BANGaction kicks in and you just sit back and accept it.<br/><br/>Effects wise (because at the end of the day, that is all a Sommers film is about) it treads the line between impressive (castles, scenery, wolfmen), and dreadful CGI (people swinging from castles, bat-creatures, cows)  This lack of consistency in the effects is, perhaps, the one thing which lets the action down at times as it becomes harder to suspend disbelief (which is bad enough when people can fall great heights without breaking limbs, or even a sweat!)  Visually superb, but overall let down by some rushed effects.<br/><br/>Overall, it wasn't a completely wasted 2 hours.  The film was marginally more enjoyable than Tomb Raider, and Torque.  I will no doubt buy it sometime down the line on DVD (probably when it is in a 3 for £20 offer at HMV).  But I can't really be bothered watching it again on the big screen, despite having plenty of opportunity, which I think speaks volumes about the film."

","Van Helsing seems to have been written by the same screenwriter who wrote The League of Extraordinary Men. That movie had a lot of characters we are all familiar with (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, etc) as the good guys. Van Helsing, on the other hand, has werewolves and vampires as the bad guys. This film may be better than League of Extraordinary Men. But its flaws don't allow it to be a good movie either.<br/><br/>Caution: the following may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>The first problem comes from the fact that most of the battles between Van Helsing and the evil vampires are simply repetitive. The female vampires battle against Van Helsing and his friends, and they are defeated. After a few minutes, the vampires come back for more. They are defeated. People start to get bored because they are overwhelmed with a sense of deja-vu. Dracula brings his offspring back to life. Then they die. Later in the movie, he brings more offspring back to life again. We are just getting more of the same stuff. Another problem is cheesy dialogue. Most of it comes from the female vampires. All these problems are  nothing compared to the disappointing ending you are going to see.  <br/><br/>The visual effects are great in this movie. It seems that every time a movie is short on plot, Hollywood glosses over this shortcoming by saturating it with the most beautiful special effects money can buy. But not even that can stop you from getting bored before the movie reaches its climax."

","*Contains Spoilers*<br/><br/>Steven Sommers is dangerous. You may not have been conscious of it until now but the man has abilities that would make many of his more fantastical characters seem redundant. Like a photochemical blue ring octopus, Sommers can paralyze the human body in less than two hours, causing higher brain functions to shut down completely. Gradually secondary functions, such as motor control, breathing and the ability to sit up straight encroach on impossible. Before long you're looking down the business end of misanthropic meltdown, a few frames away from becoming undead yourself. Will Hugh Jackman show up to put you out of your misery? Will he f***.<br/><br/>You've seen Van Helsing before. I know you don't think so at the moment but cast your mind back to Sommer's last reworking of classic, better made horror fare, The Mummy and you've got the tone, characters and production methodology reproduced with a painful attention to detail. Evidently people attending the former sent all responsible the wrong message, namely that what the public wanted was more of the same, so you see you've only got yourselves to blame. I'll certainly be punishing myself this evening.<br/><br/>
VH was supposed to be Sommer's slightly darker take on Universal's classic monster flicks but Sommers is no James Whale, though based on the evidence presented here he deserves to sample Whale's favourite pastime soon, preferably at the hand(s) of the seven footer playing Frankenstein's monster. Said creature isn't a bad metaphor for this flick, stitched together as it is from Whale's movies and Sommer's previous efforts. A copy of a copy then and with all the generational loss that implies, it's a depressing indictment of the directors big dumb fun' approach but it's too dumb to be any real fun and big in this case simply means the great man's trademark noise, wall to wall (sometimes surprisingly shoddy) computer generated effects and so close to one dimensional they can taste it, characters who constantly talk exposition rather than say anything, `We've got to get this to Van Helsing', `She's DEAD', `we've got 48 hours to save you/the world/our dignity' etc <br/><br/>The characters and plot, and I use the term lightly, replicate the Mummy perfectly. Jackman stands in for Fraser, the guy you've never heard of is John Hannah providing the not in any way comic relief and Weisz is brought back from the cine-dead as Beckensale, impersonating her kick ass heroine Schick with care but being careful to have a east European accent so that the Mummy's leading lady can't show up at Universal and claim her pay packet. She even dies for God's sake. <br/><br/>It's a poorly cut up corpse, messy in the mid-section with a blaring, ear bleeding soundtrack designed to stun the audience so that they won't notice the plot holes. It starts promisingly enough with a black and white prologue that recalls the original Frankenstein but after that this one heads for the grave with Jackman's Indiana Van Helsing, more a monster killing James Bond than anything conceived of by Bram Stoker, getting his orders from the Vatican(!), stocking up on weapons and sodding off to Transylvania to kill some really very good looking women and saving the world. That's it and you should know that by going to see this movie you're only encouraging Sommer's to make more so don't do it. He can be stopped but only if we all pull together. It's demographically target overproduced bilge from the vat marked franchise' but who are these people exactly? You, me? The teenaged gang sitting behind me in the cinema loved it, laughing in all the right places and evidently lapping up every minute. That they looked like habitual drug users was a matter of some concern. At $135M wouldn't it have been cheaper just to give these kids smack?  I lost two hours of my life today and although I'd only penciled in some light cooking and a screening of Gag Factor'(the biopic of comedian Tommy Cooper), I can't help but feel a little bitter. Cooper's gagging was impressive to say the least, incidentally.<br/><br/> Complete cock."

","Saw this on UK preview today, and in a more forgiving mood you could call this a brain-off action flick.<br/><br/>Even so that was no excuse for copying and pasting from: The Mummy (hey look the slave henchman's been typecast!), Aliens, a one-scene homage to Predator, Sleepy Hollow, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (along with its rubbish CGI from one of 8 different effects houses), Underworld, Blade, the Bond films, Evil Dead III, Raiders of The Lost Ark and Gremlins 2.<br/><br/>If you're in a bad mood, it's just terrible. Mind you I didn't like LXG either, so if you also hated that, rent this- the effects won't look so naff on a television.<br/><br/>Why? Scene-chewing exposition and a lame script that's travelog not dialogue, though the actors do their best and the chief villain of course has the best lines and provides the most fun. The whole project seems to have overwhelmed Stephen Sommers and more so, his editor. It's only partly redeemed by an ending which doesn't cop out Hollywood style and terrific, ironically OTT soundtrack from Alan Silvestri.<br/><br/>So, the first 2004 summer season flick, and unlike five years ago, it's not an unexpected surprise hit. It's not fair to keep knocking Sommers over the head with the Mummy movies, but even Deep Rising was better."

","I liked the Mummy, I thought it was an entertaining movie.  I hated The Mummy Returns with a passion but that looks like one of the greatest movies of all time compared to Van Helsing.<br/><br/>Not only does this movie have a script that appears to have been thrown together by drawing words out of a hat, Stephen Sommers also appears to have drawn movie cliche's out of a hat and thrown them into his film wherever he gets the chance!  This movie is really that bad that I was in stitches laughing.  Kate Beckinsale is her usually awful self, Hugh Jackman does all he can with the stupid script and ""that guy who plays Dracula"" has a good look, but cannot pull off a Romanian Accent.<br/><br/>With Dracula being perhaps the coolest bad guy in movie history, why can nobody ever produce a good film involving him?  If you found Underworld to be entertaining or even good, God help you, then this movie is for you. However if you have seen more than a few films, you will realise how incredibly cheesy and stupid this film is.  All it needed was the Stars and Stripes at the end to round it off as being Van Cliche."
