"Filmnerd1984","9","139","167","30 August 2009"," Superb Swedish Thriller!
","Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller."
"UnknownRealmsDotNet","8","29","32","22 July 2012"," I hate to say it, but more rounded than Fincher's version
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has been a worldwide phenomenon for a while now. In book form, the original film, and the Hollywood remake. It is a disturbing, yet riveting tale, as is the story behind the author who made it. While Fincher's version is visually and stylistically more striking, I feel this original Swedish film does a better job bringing the disturbing mystery to the silver screen. Structured much more fluidly than the Hollywood version, the mystery of a missing girl flows and develops slowly, dishing out red herrings and suspense with each turn (something lacking in the Fincher version). It also stays closer to the original title of the book (and theme) Men who Hate Women. In the end, this is a dark tale of what rape does to women and to the world. Not everyone's idea of 'entertainment,' but a thought-provoking mystery for those with strong stomachs."

","This film was very well-made with superb cinematography. The actors all portray their respective characters perfectly, although Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, Michael Nyqvist as Michael Blomkvist and Sven-Bertil Taube as Hanrik Vanger deserve a special mentioning. They are all very likable and believable.<br/><br/>The films story is very exciting and puzzling (for those that haven't read the book) and the pace is steady with some really tense situations. The investigation part of the story is excellent. Although it is 2.5 hours long it is never boring.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was also very fitting and helped to set the mood of the film. This is far above any other Scandinavian thriller production, and I look forward to the rest of the films/series.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone!"

","I went to see this film having heard nothing about it at all and another film I wanted to see wasn't on the Sunday matinée bill...so, this looked interesting...best 5 Euros I've spent in a long time. Very, very good thriller but NOT FOR CHILDREN and I was genuinely surprised how much I enjoyed it - well filmed and well acted by the main protagonists; I know nothing of Swedish actors but apparently Michael Nyqvist is well known and I thought Noomi Rapace was brilliant (a young, headstrong, tattooed and ""talented"" computer hacker Lisbeth Salander with a traumatized past) I thought the film was superbly directed (Niels Arden Oplev); I am already looking forward to the second film later this year AND I will go and buy the books..."
"AudioFileZ","7","111","140","13 September 2009"," A Worthy & Different Crime Mystery When Compared To American Films Of The Genre
","An intrigue fueled slow building thriller, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a refreshingly different take on the ""whodunit"" crime genre. This Swedish movie has loads of great cinematography, taking advantage of the beautiful Swedish country side as well as framing the eerie story. The principal characterizations are quite well suited by the cast who fit naturally in the roles they play with great realism. Like I have already noted this is a much different presentation as compared with American filmed crime thrillers. Even though this obviously has a well-funded budget it is grittier and less commercialized thus lending a realism over glossiness. The music score also adds quite a bit of ominous darkness.<br/><br/>I guess if you want to be overly critical you could punch a hole or two here or there, but I think this story comes off so most all viewers will ignore any inconsistencies in favor of the mysterious pieces which, eventually, add up, but not too fast – keeping the viewer invested and hoping to figure out how it may all end.<br/><br/>Though graphic at times, it isn't ""porn-horror"", ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a dark story where the unsettling pieces fit. I am fairly certain it will not be released in the US, but if you can see it do so as it is a well crafted and executed drama."
"yris2002","7","166","218","7 June 2009"," well crafted, engaging and thought-provoking thriller
","I am among, I guess, those very few people in Europe who have not read the best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson, but, not feeling in the mood to see another too emotionally engaging romance or drama, although its being my favourite genre, I went to see what is depicted by Larsson's fans as a captivating and gripping thriller.<br/><br/>Indeed, I can't say whether the movie proves adherence to the novel, which is something by the way difficult, considering the length of the book, however, I can say that the product is a well-crafted piece of cinema, which leaves also interesting food for thought. Used as we are, as southern Europeans, to see at Northern, and mainly Scandinavian countries, as models of democracy, economic progress and social welfare, it's quite surprising to see a modern Sweden stained by corruption and unscrupulous tycoons. Moreover, it is quite upsetting to get to know how Nazi extremist and insane ideas were rooted not so much in the history of the country, but in the conscience of people, in this case of a powerful and wealthy family, where the hatred towards the Jews has mixed with the hatred towards women, turning the lives of whole generations into a hell of ferocious violence and horror.<br/><br/>As far as the thriller story, it's engaging, but carried on very carefully, every aspect being under control, with flashbacks constantly reassuring us about aspects we have already perceived, without moving a little apart from a well consolidated stylistic model of this kind of movie genre. Sometimes a little slow, sometimes too indulging in violent scenes, but with a strong directing consciousness supporting it. Convincing and really good the performances offered by the whole cast, unknown to the great public, but I would underline the actress playing Lisbeth as really outstanding and upsetting in her mental and emotional distress. On the whole, it's not a masterpiece, but a good and well made movie."
"ralph_2ndedition","8","199","264","25 February 2009"," A captivating piece of cinema!
","The music lends a threatening aspect to the opening scene, where we in slow close ups  on and off deliberately out of focus  get to follow the opening of a package. Inside the package, post marked in Hong Kong, is a framed plant. The camera starts to move backwards, taking in more of the room and revealing Sven-Bertil Taube as the opener of the package. He holds the frame in his hands, lowers his head and slowly starts to cry.<br/><br/>Niels Arden Oplevs Män som hatar kvinnor is based on the first of Stieg Larssons three bestselling novels, meaning of course that it is basically guaranteed large box office numbers  but the expectations will probably match those numbers. Weather the film manages to live up to these expectations I cannot say  seeing as I am one of the probably only eight people who has not read Stieg Larssons books. But as a piece of cinema, completely removed from its literary origins, it definitely leaves an impression!<br/><br/>The music mentioned above, written by Peter Fuchs, is the first thing to register in the mind as something interesting Something that make everything feel very serious. The impending-doom-score composed by Howard Shore, for David Finchers Se7en, springs to mind  and this only a few seconds into the film.<br/><br/>The cold, hard, uncomfortable reality  where the movie takes place  is populated by a highly recognizable legion of people straight out of Swedens acting elite (Gösta Bredenfeldt, Lena Endre, Ewa Fröling, Björn Granath, Peter Haber och Marika Lagerkrantz to mention a few) and they all seem to have been so thrilled to be a part of this project that they almost as one has taken their characters a step back, allowing the spotlight to be shone on the two main characters, who also get to drive the story forward; the reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Mikael Nyqvist), who is digging through a 40 year old murder case involving a well known corporation family with Nazi connections, and the 24 year old computer hacker EMO Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) that every day hacks Blomkvists hard drive, captivated by the puzzling evidence (or lack thereof).<br/><br/>Nyqvist gets the job done playing what is basically the lesser of the two parts. You instinctively feel sympathy for him, and sympathizes with him  even in his very first scene, in which his character is convicted of slander, and sentenced to prison.<br/><br/>But when the lights come back on in the theatre, and you gather up your half eaten box of popcorn and your coat, it's not Mikael Nyqvists understated but persistent reporter you will remember mostit's Noomi Rapaces leather-and-stud clad, tattooed, pierced, heavy makeup wearing biker chick, Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>Weighted by old wrongdoings as well as new ones, Lisbeth is covered in emotional scars, making her a very interesting character  that easily could have been a silly rehash, a Gunvald Larsson in leather. But Noomi Rapace bases Lisbeth in real emotions rather than clichés and hammy over acting. You can tell that there is a real person behind that steely gazed, unyielding face, something that make those parts of the movie, where we get to come with her through what must be some of Swedish cinemas most horrendous scenes, feel that much more awful. You almost can't help looking away, as she is abused over and over again<br/><br/>The relationship between Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander is the only part where I felt the movie rushed things just a tad. But this is only a mild piece of criticism, as the lack of insight leaves the audience feeling that they, just like the character Mikael Blomkvist, don't know what to make of Lisbeht Salander.<br/><br/>Besides the two leads, I want to single out Peter Haber, who really got to show off his skills! He is obviously good for more than just playing the silly father of Sune or the annoyingly correct police Martin Beck.<br/><br/>I have, like I mentioned earlier, not read the novels by Stieg Larsson, and I have an automatic aversion towards Swedish cinema; which I usually find stiff, with acting taken straight out of the latest grocery store commercials. In other words, Swedish film has its work cut out trying to sell me anything. But, and I am not ashamed to admit this, I'm gonna go ahead and BUY!!!<br/><br/>In the narrow little world that is Swedish cinema there is a lot that one could  or even should  avoid. But this movie is not something to be ignored! So leave the kids at home (this is NOT a very pleasant film) and head for your nearest multiplex to take in of the most thrilling Swedish films in a very long time!"
"anders_noer","8","69","89","28 February 2009"," Loyal adaption of best seller book
","""Män som hatar Kvinnor"" is a whodunit thriller revolving around sadism towards women. It is based on the first book in Stieg Larsson's crime trilogy with the main characters journalist Mikael Blomkvist and outcast hacker Lisbeth Salander. For the record, this trilogy has had rave reviews and been among the best selling books in Scandinavia. <br/><br/>An aging corporate executive, Henrik Vanger, employs Blomkvist to solve the puzzle of his missing niece - A girl who mysteriously disappeared 40 years earlier. It has become an obsession to this man to shed some light on his missing niece's fate, and he is desperate to have closure before it's his own time to pass. Over the years 82 year old Henrik Vanger has been gathering a substantial amount of hints and clues, but he was never able to put the pieces together. Acclaimed journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired for his researching skills, following a thorough background check. Blomkvist's recent committal order doesn't discourage Vanger. He shows no interest for compromise in getting the right man for the job.<br/><br/>Eventually Blomkvist teams up with secluded computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Their investigation unfolds a complex set of clues leading to a string of morbid sadistic murders spanning decades. Pieces of the puzzle slowly start falling into place, as inevitable confrontation with the hidden villain draws closer. Alongside this main plot line, both of our main characters have to deal with personal problems that act as obstacles for the main chase and help us understand our main characters.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>When I read ""Män som hatar kvinnor"" a few years back, I told my friends: ""This would make a great movie"". It sure does. ""Män som hatar kvinnor"" is an ambitious project. Casting (character and location alike), adapting the book to script and production seem to set new standards for Scandinavian movie making. It has an international feel and does the book great justice. Key scenes from the book are flawlessly executed and the characters are captured very convincingly. Fans of the book shouldn't be disappointed. Almost three hours running time allows great depth and detail, but even at this length some plot lines have been left out. This does not hurt the overall feel though. It is still a coherent movie focusing on the main plot line. Avid fans can turn to the text version for further explanations, and still be intrigued. <br/><br/>The Lisbeth Salander character is an inventive take on a heroine. She is a believable and obvious contrast to the sadistic, women degrading evildoers. This 90 pound female hacker is depicted as being the craftier, stronger and more energetic of our heroic duo. This does however hurt Blomkvists character a bit, leaving him seemingly not too bright and kind of helpless. I DO like a female heroine though, which is a welcome twist to the classic detective genre. The novels give Blomkvist a bit more room to shine on his own, which is the only thing I'm missing in the movie. <br/><br/>Great performances all around. Most reviews will obviously comment on Noomi Rapaces outstanding performance as Lisbeth Salander and put her on a well deserved pedestal. I'm going to point the attention to Sven-Bertil Taube (Henrik Vanger) and Peter Haber (Martin Vanger) who both do great jobs as supporting actors."
"karenbickley","10","93","129","12 March 2010"," Great Movie!!!
","I saw this movie in Sydney, Australia and it was really great. A really good thriller!. I have read all three of the books and wondered how the movie would be. The theatre was packed and it was in subtitles but you could hear a pin drop. We were all glued to the screen. Once it gets going your are hooked! At the end everyone clapped. Some of the scenes are graphic and violent but if you have read the book you already know this. However, even though I had to ""read"" the movie I cant wait for the next one. At least I hope they are making a movie for book 2 and 3 I would not take my 14yr old to this but it is something I would see again. Highly recommend!"
"shatteredrifle","Null","10","11","30 August 2011"," The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo: A Crime Drama Like No Other
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo takes us into the investigation of one Harriet Vanger, who disappeared when she was just 16 years old and has been missing for the last 40 years. Still distraught about Harriet's case, her uncle, Henrik Vanger, hires troubled journalist Mikael Blomksvist to find out what happened. Along the way, he teams up with Lisbeth Salander, an eccentric hacker genius, and what they uncover is far worse than they could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>What is beautiful about this film is the simplicity of how it was made without it appearing cheap. It is proof that the lack of special effects doesn't make a film dull. In fact, it only makes other aspects shine. The movie is dialogue-driven, and a lot of things are explained through the conversations. It is quite unfortunate that I do not understand Swedish (and I had to use the subtitles while watching it) because I feel it would have been a better experience if I did.<br/><br/>Of course, behind these dialogues are the two leads Blomkvist and Salander. A recipe for a good movie is comprised of a compelling story, characters viewers can sympathize with and care about, and the interactions among these characters. For the most part, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is able to accomplish these things. Because of the film, I now understand why Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows) has suddenly been propelled to the spotlight. Indeed, her performance as Lisbeth Salander is incredible. The late Stieg Larsson would have been proud of her interpretation of his title character. Salander is arguably the most unique female protagonist the industry has seen for a long time. From her looks to her personality, we see her as complex yet somebody we can understand, talented and so sure of herself and yet at the same time so awkward. Michael Nyqvist portrays Mikael Blomkvist with an air of confidence and authority that is just fitting for the character. We can understand why Salander, not big on trust, eventually warms up to him. If Salander is the loose cannon, then he is the straight arrow that holds the film together.<br/><br/>As a fan of the book, I believe this adaptation was able to give sufficient justice. Like in all adaptations, many elements of the story were changed. However, most of these changes were done for a smoother flow and for a more viewer-friendly experience.<br/><br/>Later this year, David Fincher will be making a Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Even with stars Daniel Craig and Robin Wright attached to the project, it must pack a wallop so they can surpass the high standard that this Swedish production has set. Truly, this film has made me want to venture more into European cinema and find all the wonders it has to offer.<br/><br/>The Verdict: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a dark, gritty, excellently-done crime drama that others will try to emulate but probably won't be able to. That being said, it is not for everyone and not for the faint of heart. There is a reason that this is Rated R. The movie is very long compared to the running time of most movies coming out recently. Thus, in order to fully enjoy and appreciate this gem, one must be patient. Everything shall fall into place and in the end, you will discover that it was one of the best ways to spend 150 minutes of your time. Trust me when I say that watching the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an intelligent, heart-wrenching, unforgettable experience."
"kosmasp","8","91","129","25 October 2009"," Dark Thriller
","While I haven't read the books/novels, I enjoyed the movie very much. Even if it's only part 1 of the trilogy, it still feels like a movie that has a beginning and an ending. I can't say how that works in the books, but the translation to the screen seems really good (voting here underlines that).<br/><br/>While thrillers are mostly considered TV material and this one might borderline on that fine edge, it still deserves to be seen on the big screen. The actors (mostly unrecognizable to the worldwide audience) are really good. The editing and pacing is great and it's really a great suspense movie. A little thriller that dares to go to dark places."
"Andy-296","10","59","86","17 January 2010"," Excellent thriller
","This Swedish film is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. Based on a best seller novel by Stieg Larsson I haven't read (the first in a trilogy), it starts with Mikael, a middle aged investigative journalist being asked by the old patriarch of a powerful business clan to solve the disappearance of his beloved 16 year old nephew forty years ago. Since this happened during a family reunion at an isolated island, the patriarch believes that she was murdered, and that only a member of the family could have done so. Mikael is soon joined in the investigation by Lisbeth Salander, a troubled but brilliant twenty something female hacker, and soon they are lifting the veil on the very dark secrets behind this prestigious family. Gripping throughout, the film benefits from a number of terrific performances, especially Noomi Rapace playing Lisbeth Salander and Sven Bertil Taube as the patriarch of the clan. While the film is more than two hours long, it is never boring, and all the loose ends are tied brilliantly at the end."
"TheExpatriate700","8","17","22","14 June 2010"," Good, Taut Thriller with Excellent Character Development
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or as it is originally titled Men Who Hate Women, is one of the best contemporary thrillers I have seen in a while. It combines a suspenseful plot and brutal violence with a deep exploration of its title character. It goes beyond its plot, revolving around a missing persons investigation, to become an at times disturbing character study.<br/><br/>Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace are essential to the film's success. Both actors inhabit their roles convincingly, making us care about people who could have been stock characters. Although the bulk of praise has gone to Rapace, Nyqvist's performance is also worth attention. As Blomkvist, he provides a stable counterpart to Rapace's impulsive Lisabeth Salander, at times coming across as the more sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the level of graphic violence, particularly sexual violence, in this film. Although this may be off-putting to some viewers, it helps establish one of the film's most important themes: the impact of violence on its victims and its capacity to warp the human personality. The most graphic scenes, which come early in the film, help establish this theme, and play an important role in characterization as well.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this film will be remembered at Oscar time. It is far better than most of the dreck that Hollywood has on offer."

"Quotable","8","89","140","2 March 2009"," Nice piece of work
","My low regards for Swedish film industry aside, this is a really well crafted movie. Director Oplev apparently knows the ropes enough to make the Swedish crew seem plausible. The old school with SB Taube and Hirdwall usually deliver good characters, and Nyqvist as well. The younger talent strikes me as a bit more stiff usually and deliver dialogs as they read directly from the script. Not here. The only one that I find off, is actually Lena Endre. Not that she is bad, but she is just as we always see her. Music-wise, a big step in the right direction. I think of Howard Shore scores from Seven and Silence of the lambs. Too bad that the movie sound, the dialog in particular, doesn't hold the same standard. Also, not to give anything away, in the final scenes- bear in mind Bourne Ultimatum last scenes, and Silence of the lambs final. In short, hats of to this magnificent film. This is the proof that you don't necessarily make a good flick just on million dollar budgets as in Arn(lame), but with the right talent. In this case I salute director Oplev."
"SchimoCro","8","7","8","10 January 2013"," A true-blooded crime thriller
","A true-blooded crime thriller with a good dark atmosphere and very strong story, which certainly is not something unseen in the world of detective fiction, but it comes as a refreshment given to contemporary film offer. Wealthy tycoon Henrik Vanger hires controversial journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, to investigate disappearance of his niece, which happened 40 years ago on the island wholly owned by Vanger family. Blomkvist was sentenced to three months in prison for planted libel against corrupt entrepreneur so Vanger decides to investigate him before hiring. Lisabeth Salander gets the job of investigating Blomkvist but she continues to monitor his computer after the job was done. So, after she sees his new job for Vanger she starts helping him, firstly indirectly and soon directly. Their investigation leads to revelations of dark secrets Vanger family. Although plot is relatively simple, characterization of main characters is thorough which is not strange since this movie is just first in trilogy. In simple words, movie is very good, without both positively and negatively extremes. Perhaps some viewers will not like politicking, and the story certainly could pass without the Nazis, but all in all screenplay seems solid. Acting is at a high level, and there are no big objections on directing. Noomi Rapace that embodies Lisbeth is fantastic, but the rest of the cast is not far away. Perhaps the most remarkable is the atmosphere, which is a typical Scandinavian strong, cold and dark and it suits to story perfectly. The very end is a typical Hollywood and serious viewers will probably feel bitterness because the story had great potential to go in a more interesting and original way."

","It is a quite uncommon event, that a Swedish film should get so much attention pretty much anywhere, not just in Scandinavia or, outside its home regions, the art-house circuit (Bergman isn't exactly multiplex stuff). Of course, when the film in question is based on a best-selling novel, nay, the most profitable book in Northern Europe, it's a whole different thing: partly because of the unique circumstances surrounding its inception (the author was a journalist who wrote fiction just for fun and died shortly after submitting the final version of the manuscripts), Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy has shocked and enthralled readers all over the world, which explains why the adaptation of the first chapter, Men Who Hate Women (retitled The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in English-speaking countries), has become the most successful Swedish movie of all time. That, and the fact that it's a very good film.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the main character is, like the late author, an investigative reporter, a man in his late forties named Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist). Sentenced to a six-month stint in prison for allegedly forging evidence against a powerful businessman he wrote about in the magazine Millennium (hence the trilogy's title), he still has the time to carry out an assignment handed to him by one Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube): to find out what happened on the day Vanger's niece, Harriet, disappeared. Dis she simply vanish, or was she murdered? As the plot thickens, Mikael receives unexpected help from Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a young hacker with a troubled past and continued problems with her legal status, more specifically her sleazy guardian.<br/><br/>In the transition from page to screen, some elements had to be abandoned, obviously: gone are the data on abused women that opened each section of the book (the major contribution of Larsson's journalistic side), as well as the sly references to past detective story staples (Blomkvist and Vanger mention Agatha Christie when discussing their investigation). In terms of plot, on the other hand, the adaptation process is worthy of L.A. Confidential: no unnecessary subplots (do we really need to see Mikael sleeping with half the women he encounters?) or irrelevant side characters, just Blomkvist and Salander, an odd investigative couple whose essence is best summed up by Mikael's line: ""You know everything about me, and I don't know sh*t about you."". It's that kind of weird humor, spoken in plain, brutal Swedish, that gives the film its heart, along with a decent dose of mystery.<br/><br/>The Scandinavian landscape has its part in guaranteeing the story's success, too: like in the wonderful Let the Right One In, the cold, snowy environment provides the ideal backdrop for one of the most chilling (pun not intended) and grisly tales of murder ever committed to film. Staying true to the book's bleak core, the violence is depicted without many restrictions, especially in the central rape scene that justifies the original Swedish title and sets The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo aside from the majority of Hollywood's sanitized thrillers.<br/><br/>In short, this is a riveting, rewarding experience. Needless to say, an American version is already in the works to please subtitle-weary moviegoers. It's not necessarily a bad idea (look at what Chris Nolan did with Insomnia, originally a Norwegian picture), but can there really be a Tinseltown actress brave - and good - enough to take over from the mesmerizing Noomi Rapace? Well, at least she still has two more films to steal before that happens...<br/><br/>8,5/10"

"Philby-3","8","21","31","16 February 2010"," Grim but absorbing
","This is a grim and gritty tale lightened somewhat by an upbeat ending. Its origins as the first novel in the millennium series by Stieg Larrson is evident in a somewhat meandering storyline and a running time of two and a half hours, with the inevitable excisions from the book. Nevertheless the film stands up well on its own.<br/><br/>Sweden seems to produce detectives at the end of their tethers, ""Wallander"" for example, and the protagonist here, Mikael a journalist, starts out facing three months in jail for defaming a shonky business tycoon. I thought criminal defamation was a thing of the past, but not it seems in Sweden. Mikael has been set up, but the case has brought him to the notice of Henrick Vander, the patriarch of an old industrial family, who commissions Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his favourite niece, who disappeared from the family's island retreat nearly 40 years ago. Mikael joins forces with the tiny but intimidating Lisbeth, an ace computer hacker with a dark past and an agenda of her own.<br/><br/>They soon discover that the Vander family, except for their client who is a nice old gent, are as about a dysfunctional a family as you might ever meet, on a par with the Essenbecks of Visconti's ""The Damned"". There are skeletons everywhere, not just in the closet. However Mikael and Lisbeth crack the case, after the usual quota of menacing moments and dashing around chasing red herrings and actual clues. Filmed in the midst of a Swedish winter the atmosphere is pretty gloomy, not to mention just plain cold.<br/><br/>Michael Nyqvist inhabits the role of Mikael pretty comfortably, spending quite a lot of time looking surprised, but Nooni Rapace as Lisbeth is something else again – practically an elemental force – never was someone so vulnerable and so dangerous at the same time.<br/><br/>Nit-pickers will be delighted to learn that in a short sequence set in outback northern Australia, Mikael's FWD has the correct licence plates and its steering wheel on the right. However the lighting was most peculiar and the sheep a bit out of place – you mostly see cattle in northern Australia.<br/><br/>There are apparently two sequels in the pipeline, and despite some rather grisly moments I will line up to see them.

","I rarely include spoilers in my reviews. The only reason I will in this one is for the benefit of Noomi Rapace and other members of the cast and crew who made this movie perfect. Hollywood does the weirdest things. Rather than give a new writer a chance, they'll remake an absolutely perfect recent film. Bizarre. I truly hope it backfires on them. Seeing the trailers for the remake, I'm baffled. It's flat. There is nothing in their eyes. Noomi Rapace is gripping in this film. She's my hero. This film contains the most brutal rape scene imaginable, and I nearly had to stop watching, but I could not stop watching *her* - there was something about *her* that promised me that this was not gratuitous sadism. I cheered my guts out when she cleverly trapped the human predator and exacted justice. I had not read the book, so I had no idea this was coming. Noomi's performance is beyond 10. I can't think of another actress who has gone this deep in drama, and I want her to know, it was a very satisfying movie to watch - not mere entertainment - it was cathartic. Thank you."

","I basically enjoyed this film, as reflected in my rating but it is certainly flawed.<br/><br/>My preconception before watching the film, based upon the images of the main character, was that this was quite possibly a film that gets a lot of it's traction from the beauty of it's female star - dressed up in that Gothic she's-a-bit-disturbed kind of Matrix chic.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that the eponymous character does actually have some depth, and didn't have me groaning at tank grrrl clichés too often.<br/><br/>The film then heads off into what seem to me kind of interesting waters and is gearing up to be intelligent, well-paced, suspenseful and unconventional.<br/><br/>The problems arise when the film starts tying the mysteries up. The kind of devices that you would dismiss in a TV drama as being clichés, start surfacing with alarming regularity... It becomes more difficult to suspend your credibility... Things take on an increasingly BBC 2 Poirot kind of feel.<br/><br/>Then when you feel that the story has been told, the film continues for another unnecessary 20 minutes or so, most of that time spent spelling things out in a slightly patronising way..<br/><br/>The final scene seems well and truly out of place. People may say that ""if you read the book it all makes sense""... Maybe, but this isn't the book, and the film needs to stand on it's own two feet.<br/><br/>So I would say this is half a good film, and half a late night TV murder mystery. Worth seeing but doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion."

","Saw this unfortunately in the English dubbed version. But, that actually did not detract from the fact it's an awesome movie. What a story and so well played. If you don't know the story it will keep you entertained from start till finish (and then 2 more movies to see on the same level). Although not a massively exciting story it seems at first glance it develops so well. Well acted I think. The dubbed version they could have used better voices but you can see the intensity of the filming in the acting. Swedish police series are often very good, they are realistic. It's not about cars flying through the air and guns blazing cops. It's the human story behind it that matters, this could have happened in real life!

"bburns","10","16","24","27 June 2010"," Goodbye Ingmar Bergman, Hello Raymond Chandler
","I've always been cautious about seeing Swedish films made in the last 30-40 years. The reason is that--unlike America, Britain, Germany, China, Mexico, Italy or Australia--there is almost no controversy over who is Sweden's greatest filmmaker. And thus nearly every Swedish film I've ever seen not directed by Ingmar Bergman has either been a rip-off of the great man's work or just shallow trash. (Substitute ""Kurosawa"" for ""Bergman"" and you'll know why I also tend to avoid Japanese cinema). Nonetheless, I kept hearing about this film and the book that inspired it. As a lover of mystery novels and film noir, I decided that I need to at least give this movie a chance. And I'm glad I did. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" owes almost nothing to Bergman and everything to the novels of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Ross McDonald.<br/><br/>It begins when a sickly, elderly billionaire industrialist who knows better than to trust his awful family wants to investigate the 42-year-old disappearance of his niece--the only relative he ever loved (think ""The Big Sleep""). Through intermediaries, he hires Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace)--a hacker/private investigator with a troubled past and a large dragon tattoo on her back. Her assignment is to vet disgraced leftist journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) to see if he's up to the job. Eventually Blomqvist agrees to do the job and quickly realizes that he needs Lisbeth to help him. Revealing much more of the plot would be unfair.<br/><br/>Aside from the serpentine plot (involving Nazis, serial killers, and a clandestine romance), the thing I liked most about this movie was Rapace's performance as the inscrutable Lisbeth. Maybe there's a pattern here, or maybe it's just me, but--along with Kristen Stewart in ""The Runaways""--my two favorite female performances of 2010 thus far have been portrayals of angry, leather-jacketed bisexual young women. Without changing facial expressions, Rapace is somehow able to show anger, fear, love, sadness and embarrassment at the appropriate times. And I feel the scene where Lisbeth is raped by her parole officer ranks just as high if not higher than the scene in ""The Accused"" that won Jodie Foster her first Oscar.<br/><br/>According to this site, there is already an American remake in the works. I don't know how that's going to work. Parts of the plot are fairly Euro-centric (i.e. jail-time for libel, a local Nazi movement run by Hitler himself). Plus, the film retains novelist Stieg Larsson's radical anti-capitalist, anti-government views, which most Americans would find unpalatable.<br/><br/>The future of Swedish cinema rests on movies from that country being watchable without giving up their artistic merit. Swedish filmmakers need to step outside the notion of becoming ""the next Bergman"" because there will only ever be one Bergman. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a great first step along that path."
"gamepower","8","52","92","21 August 2009"," One of the better thrillers
","My brother and I were late for this movie, so we only got to see the audience when the lights went back on. I'd describe it as above 50. The reason is probably that this is not your average Hollywood murder movie.<br/><br/>It has most of the elements that thrillers of this kind have. Clue by clue you are lead to the murderer, but the answer is only revealed at the end. Where is movie differs from most common thrillers is that characters are described more realistically, without certain bounds that most movies seem to have. This adds to the intensity of 'Men who hate women'.<br/><br/>This intense detective has some interesting twists, and should be quite enjoyable for most adults."
"apoltix","9","19","32","17 February 2009"," Very enjoyable and exciting movie
","I saw this movie today in a pre-release screening 10 days before the official release in Denmark.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie. I haven't read the book, so I can't compare the two. I'm Danish, the movie is Swedish (info: Denmark and Sweden are neighbors and share a very similar language), and I haven't really seen any Swedish movies before.<br/><br/>You can compare this movie to Kongekabale (2004). The themes are somewhat similar: secrets must be researched and uncovered, and someone tries to kill others in order to prevent the secret from getting out.<br/><br/>I think both the main characters (Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander) are likable characters. My favorite is definitely Lisbeth Salander, as her being tech-savvy is something I can relate to. You get to know Lisbeth's history, while Mikael's is not revealed too much. I think this might be something missing from the plot, though I don't think it's that serious, as it's not really crucial information that will render the rest of the plot fuzzy and confusing.<br/><br/>Again, there are several times in the movie where you get to know Lisbeth more. I think this is because the majority of the people watching this type of films can relate more to the journalist (Mikael), than the Gothic computer hacker Lisbeth. I actually liked this, since her part of the movie catches my fancy. That being said, I also liked the rest of the movie. Very exciting. Hard to keep your eyes off the screen at most times.<br/><br/>Definitely recommendable."

","This is the way Hollywood should learn to balance the suspense of a thriller and the character of a good drama. The chemistry between the two leads and their ability to convey the complexities of their relationship are a huge draw when watching this movie.<br/><br/>The girl is complex, and this first movie in the trilogy only gives a glimpse of her back story - a violent young woman, who at 24 years old is still saddled with a guardian who wants to oversee her money and all her activities. Even though she is the title character, the investigator/journalist who crosses paths with her is really the driving persona in the story. We follow him into a murder mystery, where her story is only a backdrop to her character and her motivation for helping the investigation.<br/><br/>The murder mystery itself is just as compelling as it begins to take the lead. While the structure of setting up such complex characters before getting into the main storyline is a little foreign to the American audience, it's necessary for a story with such characters and it's handled seamlessly here. The story never loses its drive, and its climax touching on issues of race dynamics, twisted psychologies and dysfunctional families, is worth every moment of the film's buildup.<br/><br/>And the second movie in the trilogy is even better!"
"Sylviastel","10","6","8","19 January 2012"," Suspenseful, Intriguing! What movies should be about!
","This film is not for children or squeamish adults. This film has shocking moments like Lisbeth's relationship with her appointed guardian for instance. I won't spoil the circumstances but it's worth noticing Lisbeth's sense of justice throughout the film. Without knowing it, she is following Michael Blomquist, a disgraced journalist with prison time for libel. Anyway, he has six months so he takes a leave and is hired to find out about the disappearance of Harriet Vanger. The Vanger family is one of the wealthiest in the country but they have their share of secrets. Anyway, the story slowly unravels at a decent pace. I haven't read the books but I was interested in seeing the Swedish film over the American version of the same story. Maybe it's because I think Sweden has a great cast in this film. The actress who plays Lisbeth Salander is fantastic in this role. She was plays Lisbeth in the trilogy. I can't wait to see those films."
"john-souray","3","28","52","14 July 2010"," Epic in length only
","The copy of this I rented has the presentation of a feature film, but I think it may have been edited from a Swedish television series adapting a trilogy of novels, of which this is the first. This version is a little over two and a half hours, but the IMDb notes that there is a fuller three hour version which I'm guessing might have been the original TV presentation. What was in that extra half hour? It might contain material that answers some of the criticisms I make below, but I wouldn't want to bet on it.<br/><br/>The basic plot is that an investigative journalist, smarting from losing a libel case brought by a corrupt businessman, and facing a jail sentence (for libel? They must do things differently in Sweden), is hired by a wealthy businessman impressed with his integrity to investigate the disappearance, decades earlier, of his niece. The businessman is convinced (for reasons that are not entirely clear) that she must have been murdered by a member of his family (note that this is a very old-fashioned family-based capitalist enterprise, on the Buddenbrooks model).<br/><br/>With over two and half hours to explore, one might hope for some real plot and character development and some fine dramatic scenes, but the drama is almost entirely dead. Here are some of the things we don't get (I could list more, but am avoiding spoilers): <br/><br/>We get very little idea what the family enterprise actually is. There's a photo of a ship;are they shipbuilders, perhaps? Or are they just exporting goods?<br/><br/>Though the family are mostly gathered on the island, and the investigator assembles a handy photographic family tree, we scarcely get to meet most of them, even less witness any dramatic interplay between them. I remember one scene only in which the family actually get together to attempt to deter the investigator. <br/><br/>We have been assured by the patriarch that the family are greedy, grasping,selfish vipers, but we are treated to none of the dramatic or satirical fun that might come from this. <br/><br/>Though the island has great symbolic significance, it has no cinematic presence at all. The bridge that we are assured is the only way on or off the island might just as well be a bridge across a river for all the difference it makes.There is little sense of remoteness, isolation or confinement. <br/><br/>There is a dark undercurrent of previous Nazi involvement. But this is just stated baldly, as a fact. We get very little idea of what this meant or even really when it was. During the war? Neo-nazi revivalism? Both? And apart from the fact that we can take it as given that Nazis are nasty people, there is no attempt to explore how this actually affects their actions and beliefs. <br/><br/>More simply, what we have here is the Swedish equivalent of an English country house murder, basically dealing with the rich and privileged, and with the cast of suspects conveniently assembled in a single location. But instead of the detective teasing out the solution by interrogating the suspects, playing them off against each other, and catching them out, all we get is seemingly endless shots of the investigator or his computer-whiz sidekick tap-tap-tapping away on their laptops (Apple Macs, if you must know, and heaven knows you get long enough to admire the speed and smoothness of the software).<br/><br/>Look, I know that the Internet and cheap computing has brought about a revolution in thinking and behaving and that film-makers are struggling to come to terms with it, but let me propose a general working rule for film-makers. Computers are not dramatically interesting. <br/><br/>It's like voice-over. You can get away with it a bit, and sometimes it can even enhance a film; but if you find yourself relying on the voice-over, then chances are you've gone wrong. You're failing to tell the story properly in the medium of cinema, and if it's just a straight narration, your audience would be better off reading a book. So it is with computers and internet investigations. You can have a secondary character who's a computer expert, or you can have one episode of intensive computer use if the plot absolutely requires it. But if you find that the whole drama relies on it, or worse, that you have to fill all your screen-time showing it, then you can be sure you've gone badly wrong. Your audience would be better off surfing the net themselves, or composing electronic music, or photoshopping their snapshots, or playing games.<br/><br/>What was that? Oh, yes, the sidekick. Well, that's the woman ""with the dragon tattoo"", though why she has it I still don't know. It's just the title of the film. She's a young lesbian punk, though hilariously, as in every middle-aged liberal man's fantasy, the investigator succeeds in ""turning"" her just by the sheer non-sexist force of his personality. Oddly enough, she has her own sub-plot, involving a corrupt ""probate guardian"" (I think that's a subtitle mistranslation for parole or probation officer), which is much more interesting than the main story, but over rather quickly. This I think, properly scripted, would have made a much more rewarding film of about the standard 90 minute length.<br/><br/>And the libel case comes back at the very end, though bizarrely it seems to have nothing to do with the main story. True enough, life's generally not like that, and not everything is connected, but it is characteristic of the scriptwriter's complete absence of any sense of drama that this opportunity to create some dramatic unity is muffed.<br/><br/>The flashes of sexual violence, just about acceptably presented as would befit a television programme, are nothing more than a desperate attempt to inject some artificial edginess into this ditchwater dull plodding drama."

In addition I usually find your mainstream thrillers and crime dramas gut rottingly dull. <br/><br/>What you get with this film is a clumsy crime thriller who's main protagonist is a dark, complex, but poorly drawn female. A good portion of the film is spent justifying her eccentricity in a series of gratuitous scenes where she is made to perform sexual acts. I understand the theme of men who hate women etc. My problem is that it seems to be saying the only reason someone could be like this is through some kind of abuse or tragedy. I find this sort of logic simplistic and annoying. The scenes themselves are a cheap way to get you to feel something for the character. That said Noomi Rapace does an excellent job considering the drivel she is given to work with - she almost manages to polish a turd. The acting from her supporting cast is clunky to say the least.

Then it becomes idiotic. Then it gets boring.<br/><br/>A procedural drama is fine. A procedural drama spiced with dynamic, interesting characters is better than that.

","Although this Swedish version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' was followed by two sequels and an English language film a couple of years ago directed by David Fincher, it is very much the best of the four films.<br/><br/>It is a very loyal adaptation of the book (generally one of the most faithful book-to-film adaptations around), which is a fantastic read and has become of my favourite books recently, adhering closely to many of the book's events and such and also perfectly maintaining the bleak and murky atmosphere the book effortlessly creates. However, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' works even better on its own terms. The central relationship between Mikail and Lisbeth is ever so slightly rushed, however it still resonates while wisely not taking over the story too much (doing a much better job in this aspect than Fincher's.<br/><br/>Fincher's version may be more audacious visually, though this film is a long way from a hack job, and the script here does occasionally lack polish and flow. However, the atmosphere is much more effective here and there is generally more tension and chills, and personally prefer the performances here too (though Rooney Mara in Fincher's film is certainly no slouch).<br/><br/>Enough with the comparisons. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' (2009) does look great, the bleakness of the setting adds so well to the atmosphere and it's tightly edited and very nicely shot. The haunting and doom-laden score fills one with dread and creates a lot of rich tension. Neil Arden Oplev's directing is masterful, building on the tension and suspense to frightening heights while also directing with a lot of class.<br/><br/>'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's' story is incredibly gripping, there is a lot of subplots and characterisation and the film remarkably makes everything intriguing, layered and complete. The long running time allows this to happen admittedly, but with a good deal going on and with deliberate pacing the film easily could have rushed through things or neglected aspects but very rarely does those things. The subplots are superbly chilling with constant and effortless delivery of shock after shock. The bleak and murky atmosphere is present throughout, as is the dark and at times brutal (but not gratuitously so) tone, with plenty of twists and turns that shock and surprise better than a lot of thrillers from the US.<br/><br/>All the acting is very good indeed, but it's the two leads that really impress. Michael Nyqvist makes his vulnerable and flawed character a fascinating character that could have been less complex in lesser hands, but the film does belong to Noomi Rapace, whose seamlessly enigmatic performance is positively screen-burning.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film and one of not many book-to-film adaptations that treats its source material with respect. Swedish thrillers don't get much better than this. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

So I looked into the subtitled versions i eventually I watched the original extended Swedish version with English subtitles. And boy am i glad i did! The story follows a journalist called Mikael Blomkvist who is about to be sent to jail for publishing an article on a certain man. But he is given 6 months before he goes into jail. He is then asked by another man called Henrik Vanger to help him look for a girl who disappeared 40 years ago. Mikael looks into this case that was closed many years ago and is determined to find this girls body before Henrik dies. Mikael finds this case extremely difficult and i about to give up when a girl called Lisbeth Salander a hacker working for some company, hacks into Mikael's emails and solves one major puzzle for him. he then persuades her to help him in finding the person who was responsible for this girls disappearance 40 years ago. With Lisbeth's help they find a trail of murders that happened through out the years and that all seem to link back to the girls disappearance. This film was very interesting and entertaining and kept me wondering who the killer was right until the end. But it is also quite violent in some parts and also has a lot of swearing through out.(This doesn't bother me, but some people might find it offensive.) Also there is quite a graphic rape scene in the film, no nudity is shown but there is a lot of scream's, this people will find disturbing and difficult to watch (I did!) I thought this movie was very well written and cleverly done, So it deserves 10/10. I haven't read the books so i can't compare. But after i watch the trilogy i may read them!

The plot time line was mixed up and everything, and the Millennium magazine seemed to have been tacked on to the movie, when it really does play a Major role with Mikael and the Vanger Family but was only a foot note in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Though if I had never read the book I think the movie would have been OK, I think the characters could have been fleshed out and I felt the conclusion was rushed quite a bit. But I consider it a good mystery/thriller, though it could have been so much better."

","I'm at a loss. The book was so dull I couldn't finish it, and decided to watch the movie instead to discover the 'amazing' characters and 'gripping' plot everyone's talking about.<br/><br/>I can't work out whodunit in an episode of Miss Marple, but even I was ahead of the protagonists. The thought that this was a murder mystery that had flummoxed the greatest brains in Sweden for 40 years was laughable. Clunky plot, ridiculous clues, convenient misidentifications - this has got the lot.<br/><br/>The only things I can see that mark this film/book out as being in the slightest bit different from average TV-movie fare is the completely gratuitous sex scenes.<br/><br/>I'm not the kind of person who says 'I'm no prude but...' BUT The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like a middle-aged man's nasty sex fantasies mixed with humdrum missing persons case. It even features that most pathetic of porn titillations - the lesbian who only really needs a good man to convert her (and presumably to get her to leave her live-in girlfriend who's completely disposable, of course). By the end, the edgy, rather ugly, punky lesbo Lisbeth is even transformed by a blonde wig, spiky shoes and some golden backlighting. Presumably so that the plain-as-a-potato saggy hero has a PROPER trophy for all his daring journalism. Effing dire.<br/><br/>On top of that it's packed full of clichés and cardboard cut-out characters. The much touted Lisbeth Salander is vaguely interesting until she decides randomly to have sex with the hero - a decision so out of character for a lesbian abuse victim that it would be laughable if it wasn't so insulting.<br/><br/>I couldn't watch this film without thinking of the millions of people who have been conned into thinking they are reading/watching some kind of breakthrough master of crime at work. I also couldn't help thinking that I'm happy Stieg Larsson is dead so he can't profit from his tedious claptrap.<br/><br/>A really unlikeable film, and I despair for the world."

","I went to see this based on the trailer, which gave me a totally wrong impression of it, as does the American distribution title. The ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is really a rather subsidiary character and frankly not very interesting. What this is really about is an uninspired murder mystery, and the real protagonist is yet another investigative journalist, and not one with a whole lot of personality. The actress who plays the titular ""girl"" makes a pretty sincere effort to turn an unbelievable fantasy into a real person, but I've seen all the relevant clichés rehashed too many times to have much interest in seeing them again. The ""magic hacker"" trope is relied upon heavily but is never executed very credibly. Once again, we're expected to believe that any kind of data can be downloaded from anywhere as long as you wear something cool enough while you're tapping randomly on the keyboard. It's not a bad movie, but it's nothing special and will mainly appeal to people who have already bought into the whole murder-mystery pot-boiler genre."
"lavatch","Null","2","2","10 November 2019"," The ""Extended"" Version is Superb!
","The outtakes that were compiled for the special ""extended"" version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" added to the atmosphere and the character developments. Above all, the new footage helped to clarify a number of the plot strands in the Swedish adaptation of the best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson.<br/><br/>The principal narrative of the search for what happened to the character ""Harriet,"" as begun by the tycoon Henry Vanger was not terribly compelling in its own right. Harriet had been presumed dead after the passing of forty years, yet Henry Vanger received an annual reminder that forced him never to forget the disappearance of Harriet.<br/><br/>The evolving relationship of the two collaborators, Bloomqvist and Lisbeth Salander, is what makes the search intriguing. The beautiful photography in the outdoor scenes and the remote location of the Vanger enclave also contributes to the mystique. The film could have been a mundane ""Clue"" or Agatha Christie mystery; instead, the film had psychological depth and nuance.<br/><br/>Above all, it is the magnetic Noomi Rapace who sustains attention for three hours. Her compelling interpretation is guided by the intensity of her eyes, as captured in the close-ups and the camera angles. The character development is unforgettable, as she begins to discover human compassion in the kind journalist, who becomes her colleague, companion, and lover while relentlessly pursuing the truth."

","I thought this movie was a well done adaptation of the book! The way I had imagined the characters, buildings, countryside, offices etc while reading all were very similar to how they were portrayed in the movie. However, I'm wondering how much I would have liked it had I NOT read the books. I feel that movie adaptations often leave out a lot of ""back-story"" and when you add that to having to read subtitles (which seemed very basic) - I really felt I knew more about the story than those who never read the books. I'm not sure if that makes sense, I just think I enjoyed the subtitled movie more because I had read the books. This movie is NOT for kids, or for watching on your iPad on the plane! Some very disturbing scenes."
"toll-8","8","2","2","8 November 2011"," See for Lisbeth Salander alone.
","Based on the novel of the same name, this film follows three characters as they intersect each other's lives. Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) is a journalist who has just been sentenced to three months in prison after claims of libel from a corrupt business tycoon. Blomkvist believes he has been set up but nothing helps his case. He is given six months to handle his affairs before being locked away. Henrik Vanger is an elderly man who receives framed, dead flowers once a year from an unknown source. The flowers used to come from his niece who disappeared forty years ago and Henrik believes she is dead. He has never given up hope on finding her and hires Blomkvist to look into her disappearance to give him piece of mind, especially since he still receives the flowers. Blomkvist accepts this last job before he goes inside.<br/><br/>Next we introduce the most intriguing movie character I have ever seen, Lisbeth Salander. A socially inept lesbian with short hair, nose, ear and lip piercings and tattoos draped across her back and arms. She is the girl of the title. She is introduced as a researcher who is secretly photographing Blomkvist during his trial. Also being an expert computer hacker she is hacking into his computer so she can see what he sees. After having a troubled up bringing she is left in the care of a guardian, with her Mother in a hospital. Her new guardian however attempts to blackmail her for sexual favours, before savagely raping her, something she manages to film and gain revenge on by tattooing this man's chest. These scenes are some of the most harrowing I have seen and expertly filmed. <br/><br/>During his investigation, Blomkvist is sent an email from Lisbeth which helps him with the clue he is struggling to solve. After this he recruits her to aid in his investigation. This is where the film really gets its wheels. From here on in we dive into a world of family conspiracy, incest and rape and the battle of vulnerable women against controlling men. I did not realise that this is what this film was about. Those of you who have read the book will but those who haven't will get a bit of a shock.<br/><br/>I have to say I struggled to get into the beginning of this film. Many have told me that to enjoy the book you have to persist with the first fifty pages and once you do the book gets a hold of you. I felt this was definitely the case with the film also. It took a while for it to get going and considering it is subtitled I found myself becoming a little switched off. However I'm glad I didn't as once I had got past that section I was gripped. When Blomkvist and Salander finally meet, the film really gets going. Before that seems too long and at that point of the film I thought that too but now I have finished it I realise how important it was in giving insight into the characters, especially Lisbeth.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is nothing to shout about but where the film really grips you is the characters. OK maybe not characters but character. Blomkvist is a little dull and not your typical hero and considering the title of the film, I was surprised to see him be the main character. Lisbeth on the other hand is intriguing. I want to know more about her, even know. Very little is told and the character alone keeps you hooked on the film. She is bigger than the entire plot and she makes you take notice whenever she is on screen. Noomi Rapace is fantastic as her and even manages to give a Gothic woman covered in piercings and tattoos a very sexy edge. The chemistry between the leads is great and the relationship is not clichéd in the slightest.<br/><br/>I don't want to say too much about this film as it is one you really have to see. Get past the first twenty minutes and the subtitles and enjoy the characters on that screen. Lisbeth Salander is fascinating. She is to be played by Kate Mara in the American remake and she has a hell of a pair of shoes to fill. There is so much to enjoy in this movie and 'she' is a character you will all enjoy watching. <br/><br/>The film is definitely for adults only with scenes of violence, rape and bondage but the excellent direction and cinematography handles it all tastefully although they are a little harrowing. The performances in these scenes are just fantastic. I can't state this enough: go and watch this movie."
"teajel","7","2","2","21 July 2010"," The girl with awesome tattoo- a dark mysterious well made crime movie
","Girl with dragon tattoo comes as a good mystery film that full of suspense and thriller and with a excitement like a b-movie this ambitious mystery crime drama also delivered it with an unique and interesting central character that deeply acted by a tremendous actor <br/><br/>The story follows  a ambitious journalist named Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who worked for the magazine Millennium, lost a libel case brought on by corrupt Swedish industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström. The magazine & he were ordered to pay for damage and Blomkvist was due to head for prison in the next few months.<br/><br/>While waiting to serve his sentence, Blomkvist was approached by Henrik Vanger's representative. After some hesitation, he came to see Mr. Vanger, the frail & wealthy octogenarian of The Vanger group, who lived in a remote island, surrounded by other family members' houses.<br/><br/>It turned out Mr. Vanger wanted to hire Blomkvist to unearth the truth behind his niece Harriet's apparent murder some forty years ago when she was sixteen. Although her body was never found, Mr. Vanger believed it was murder because that day there was an accident on the only bridge that linked the island with the mainland. The bridge was closed, nobody could get out & nobody could get on the island. Yet, Harriet just vanished into thin air. There's not a day gone by which Mr. Vanger didn't think about her.<br/><br/>Before going to the island to see Mr. Vanger, Blomkvist didn't know that he was being followed & photographed by Lisbeth Salander, a punk who made a living as a computer hacker.<br/><br/>The young woman had problems of her own. Due to crime committed in her youth ( later we learnt that when she was much younger, she had set fire to a man, presumably her abusive father, in a car ), she had to report to a guardian who controlled her money. One day, he forced her to give him a blow job or else he threatened to accuse her of causing trouble and have her put into a psychiatric hospital. <br/><br/>When Blomkvist found out his PC had been hacked into he was able to trace back to Salander & came to her place. He persuaded her to collaborate with him in the investigation of Mr. Vanger's niece. Together they dug up more troubling and disturbing information. The story of course was perfectly written with a lot of twist in it and make it mysteriously dark disturbing at some point making this a really good crime movie with it's own charm. And also with a weird chemistry that later builds between  Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth salander that also make the movie more exciting and fun in a bizarre way make the movie character looks like a dark moody and bizarre version of starsky and hutch.    I really recommend this to anybody who like a crime drama movie with an interesting central character and with an acting that really lives up the movie this is really a must watch crime drama on it's own creativity"
"DVDZombie","4","10","18","23 August 2010"," Ridiculously overrated
","This is yet another one of those movies. You hear about it, everyone seems to be raving about it, the reviews are all positive, you wait and wait for a chance to see it. The time finally rolls around, you settle in for what you think will be a fantastic film, you watch it and by the time it's done you wind up wishing you could get the last two hours of your life back.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is that it's so slow, you could watch paint dry and find it more thrilling. The acting overall is decent, but the story is disjointed and at times you forget what's actually going on in the movie because it keeps switching back to one of the dumbest sub plots I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Parts of the movies plot that are supposed to connect with each other never really seem to and the parts that do connect well don't really seem to add up. Then there's the character of Lisabeth, who is the focus of the movies sub plot and ties in...or rather is supposed to tie in to the main plot line later in the film. The character is so over done, you might think you were watching an Anime cartoon instead of a live action movie. Mainly, it's her wardrobe that causes that and if they had simply dressed her normally, Lisabeth would be a far believable. There are other issues with her, but her wardrobe is just so ludicrous for most of the movie that it sticks out like a sore thumb. There's also the issue of the scenes involving her probation officer, which I had heard were horrid and hard to watch. All I can say is, nothing to see here...move along. Yes she gets raped and yes she returns the favor but both scenes are done so poorly it's hard to find either really offensive or shocking. How you have a teenage girl get raped and then rape her attacker, yet manage to show less violence then a 90210 episode, I will never understand. Aside from that, is shock value all the producers were after here? <br/><br/>Between the assault in the subway tunnel, the office sex scene, the rape, the revenge rape and so on, the film makers seem to have forgotten they were supposed to be making a thriller. I won't give away the ending, but I will say this. It's not much of a shock and it wasn't worth sitting through this movie to see it. From beginning to end you feel like you waiting for something that just never happens. The pace is terrible, the thrilling moments are a yawn and the entire movie feels like something from the nineteen nineties. All of the characters are cliché and the storyline is rife with plot holes. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go wash my Blu Ray player out with soap."
"colinrgeorge","5","10","18","6 April 2010"," ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""
","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is hardly what I expected from the highest grossing Swedish film of all time. Maybe it's the graphic rape, I don't know—I was expecting something more commercial. The good news is that in such moments, ""Dragon Tattoo"" is disquietingly powerful. The bad news is that they lie few and far between an otherwise mediocre mystery. Swedish actress Noomi Repace plays the eponymous lead, Lisbeth Salander, and brims with a badassery on par with Franka Potente of ""Run Lola Run."" She's terrific, but let me say this up front—The character and her performance are better than the film (or at least its second half) deserves.<br/><br/>The first seventy-five minutes impressively juggle gritty, squeamish scenes of Lisbeth's abuse at the hands of her slimy probate and her subsequent revenge, with a straightforward, slow-paced thriller involving Mikeal Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), a journalist convicted of libel, being privately hired to shed light on a long cold family kidnapping case. The two threads are remarkably dissimilar in theme and style, and it's a peanut butter and jelly situation for the film; they complement each other ideally, preventing the other from becoming tiresome.<br/><br/>But as should be expected from a story with simultaneously unraveling plot lines, we soon reach their intersection, and although it's a matter of personal preference, for me ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" flounders once its characters coalesce. For starters, Lisbeth's infinitely more interesting arc (and consequently, its stylish flourish) is swallowed by Mikeal's when she becomes his investigatory partner midway through the film. The 'straightforward, slow-paced thriller' takes hold, with the odd addition of a buddy cop dynamic. Generations collide! Lisbeth understands computers and Mikeal has antiquated taste in music!<br/><br/>It's a weird turn, and one I don't think ""Dragon Tattoo"" really recovers from. The character of Lisbeth is far and away its highlight, and if anything, as the film progresses, her role becomes increasingly marginalized. She loses the snap and snarl that she has independently as she and Mikeal inevitably get intimate, and maybe for some, watching the two change each other as the case comes into focus will be the emotional apex, but I found it a disappointing detour. Lisbeth's act of unflinching vengeance early in the film is neither topped nor matched—She becomes more boring in Mikeal's presence.<br/><br/>Maybe it's that a relationship in general doesn't feel convincing for so scarred a character. Certainly this is the implication of Lisbeth's interest in sex above intimacy, but it feels like a requisite development dictated by genre expectation rather than an organic attraction between the two characters. That she uses sexuality as a vehicle for self-empowerment is an interesting angle, but then I don't buy the legitimate affection later on. Lisbeth has a photographic memory and is haunted by her past—She isn't the sort of person whom I believe has a dormant tenderness.<br/><br/>""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is long, and by the end of the engagement, I felt exactly what the dual story lines prevented me from feeling: tired. The wrinkles in the mystery aren't especially surprising, and the plot is stretched to the point that I'm almost inclined to forget what I found initially so compelling about the characters because where it takes them is so much less so. Lisbeth is fiercely independent, and watching her emasculate her pervert probate has a gratifying brutality that seeing her play second fiddle in a PI procedural couldn't hope to.<br/><br/>My mixed feelings about the film make it difficult to consolidate a final score, so I'll leave it here: ""Dragon Tattoo"" is a film I half-liked."
"ProtoJ18","3","15","30","1 September 2010"," ""And I would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for you meddling lesbians! And your little Journalist too!""
","When I saw this movie I had been told a couple million times it was the 'bee's knees' and if I knew anything about film, I'd be enraptured by its 'goodness'. That's about where things go terribly wrong.<br/><br/>First, I'll state what this film does effectively demonstrate: That by dying, and by being 'foreign', you can get hyped like there's no tomorrow by American audiences who really, by now, don't know any better. If you can even get the smallest bit of 'critics' (term used loosely) to spread the word, then the cash flow is guaranteed. Ensured by a movie going public too ignorant to know the difference between good and bad and too weak to disagree with those that think they do. So now let the good times roll.<br/><br/>The number 1 misrepresentation about this movie is that this is a murder mystery (anybody who calls this a thriller probably gets a raised pulse from Sunday traffic so I'm just gonna ignore that.) Oh, there's murder alright, by the second act the movies dishing out murders like it's going out of style. There's a mystery too, or at least it 'seems' like a mystery.<br/><br/>But the movie's not about any of that crap. This paper thin cold case might as well be on CSI: Who Gives a Damn, if that was what it was about. All we need to do is read the title, and it's certainly not, Rich Evil Guys Are Rich and Evil, or The Girl Who Died Or Something Maybe. Nope. It's the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. And she's the whole point.<br/><br/>But first let's take a look at out main 'character' (term used loosely). Interesting. An investigative journalist/writer. Middle aged. Hmm, kinda reminds me of someone. Oh yeah. The author. The only difference is this 'investigative journalist' is boning some butch lesbian who's twice the man at half the age. You ever think to yourself, whittling away on your laptop 'Wouldn't it be kinda cool, and just a little kinky, if some young chick who could beat me up was reading this'? Well, I certainly don't; but this guy does. And that's the point of the novel. To showcase this fantasy girl and build their relationship(?), while they screw around with 'biblical related murders' (never seen that before /sarcasm) and 'a rich family on an island where everyone is a suspect'. They might as well have brought Scooby Doo along for the ride.<br/><br/>So SuperGirl and her sidekick The Bumbling Journalist (who might as well have been slipping on banana peels and wearing his underpants on his head by the end of the movie, for all the use he was) trudge through 'murders' that might have been 'shocking' to audiences back in the prohibition, while having 'hawt sex'. Cause every 24 year old girl with a spiked collar and tattoos wants to have sex with a middling older guy, right? <br/><br/>Eventually we learn that 'rich white males', who rape and kill girls because that's what every rich white male does (duh) are behind this fiendish plot. And by exposing him doing stuff you'd think any PI with half a brain could have done 40 years ago, they convince the villain to crash his car for no real reason... and then bring the 'dead' girl back from Australia where she was just waiting for a spunky lesbian and a down on his journalist to bring her back. She hadn't contacted her beloved uncle because... well... ummm.... and then the move ends. But not before the Journalist pulls a Jennifer Aniston on his poor broken heart and DragonTattoo brings down even more (!!) rich white males (those bastards!). And then a little Mary Tyler Moore shot of TattooGirl that says, 'oh you just gotta love her'.<br/><br/>So: If you wish a butch chick was scoping out your computer right now, or want to nod along with the rest of the movie going yes men who don't know how to form an opinion of their own, then go see this movie. If not, you're probably better off with Scooby Doo."

The book was probably great. The movie is grisly. The actress at the center gives a game performance, but the movie never earns the right to display its endless disturbing examples of destructive human behavior by illuminating their origins or consequences in any discernible way.

","Dear movie critics, stop overpraising foreign language films, they are not automatically better than films in English. Anyway, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is actually the tale of a professional hacker that is very goth and very anti-conformist, that meets a crusading investigative journalist that has just been wrongly sentenced to prison for libel. Before heading off to the big house the reporter agrees to investigate the 40 year old disappearance of a young girl for a very wealthy man with not long to live. The reporter investigates the case for a time before the dragon tattooed girl hacks into his system and uncovers a lead for him, ultimately leading to both romantic and professional partnerships.<br/><br/>The movie spends an inordinate amount of time establishing the hardships faced by the dragon tattooed girl : her step father was a drunk that abused her mom, she set him on fire, got sent away, is under legal supervision, can't control her own finances, is raped by her legal guardian, is attacked by roving street gangs, gets revenge on her guardian by filming his rape of her and then raping him with a dildo and tattooing ""I am a sadist pig and a rapist"" on his chest. The anti-social goth girl with issues is not real difficult to get across so the mountain of character establishment was really unnecessary. With a running time of 2 1/2 hours some trimming up would have been appreciated.<br/><br/>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo seemed more like a dark, high production value Lifetime movie than an international film sensation.

"smprescott-1","1","24","53","7 August 2010"," Fancied Up TV Thriller Fodder
","What the creators of this film have done is to take the Gruesome TV Thriller genre and give it the appearance of an art film by providing a more intricate plot, a sense of immediacy and far better production values. If you like CSI Miami, you'll absolutely love The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br/><br/>That's the entertainment value. What is the value of this film as a component of popular culture? Back in the late 40s, proponents of film censorship defended it by arguing that without it, movies would eventually succumb to the law of gravity and become a force for cultural degradation. Cultural liberals have used this argument as a laugh line ever since. Watch this movie (or any of the others like it) and if you can then roll your eyes over the cultural degradation argument, you are a confirmed member of the dreaded liberal cultural elite. For the rest of us however, it should be obvious by now that the dire prediction has come to pass. The question as to how society digs its way out of the moral cesspool is 'beyond the scope of this review' but I pose it for your consideration.<br/><br/>What is the political value of this film? Quite high actually if you are a radical feminist. I have not watched it a second time in order to precisely document my remarks but I do believe that roughly half of the male characters in it spend a great deal of their leisure hours torturing, raping and killing women using Bible passages as a guide. Except for science fiction and horror films there is a general understanding that movie scripts should be reasonably believable. Can anyone seriously believe that four out of a total of seven or eight male characters in any given setting are sexual psychopaths? This is the worst kind of stereotyping and it is shameful.<br/><br/>Take a reliable TV formula, add three or four tablespoons of sex and violence, a dash of feminist anger as a substitute for ideas and a sprinkling of cinematic platitudes. Bake until half-done and you get The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. If you can watch it for free, its tolerable adult escapism but nothing more."

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo or as it was originally titled, Millennium: Part 1: Men Who Hate Women is a very dark movie in the style of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Seven."" It also has a lot in common with the excellent book Place of Execution by Val McDermid and its very good TV adaptation, especially in the part that deals with the investigation of the old disappearance case of a 16 years old girl. It is interesting that David Fincher who had made""Seven,"" is working on the American re- make of the tattooed girl already, even though the Swedish film was released less than a year ago. The film is good, not great but certainly very watchable and it is the most interesting when Noomi Raspace's Lisbeth Salander takes the screen. This is a character with obviously something so horrifying in her past that had changed her forever and altered her life in many ways. Lisbeth is a a Computer hacker of highest class and she helps to the popular but fallen on the hard times financial journalist Mikael Blomqvist who faces the jail time for the lost libel case against the powerful industrialist to solve the cold case of the mysterious disappearance of Harriet Vanger. The beautiful and sweet 16 year old girl from a wealthy and influential family disappeared without a trace 40 years ago, and her uncle, 82 year old Henrik Vanger the owner of Vanger Corporation, wants Mikael to take a closer look at the case. The film is long, 152 minutes, but is quite watchable due to good pacing, interesting story, and one of the most fascinating, complex and enigmatic characters that I've seen in the movies in long time. Must warn you that the movie fits its original title Men Who hate The Women and contains several scenes of violence toward women and equally brutal but in my opinion and in the opinion of my 80 years old mother and my husband highly justified but difficult to watch revenge scene. As it is well known, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the adaptation of the first book in the phenomenally successful Millennium trilogy by a Swedish journalist Stieg Larsson, published after his sudden and untimely death. Larsson wrote the books for his pleasure, and decided to offer them for publication shortly before his death. Larsen called the first novel Men who hated women, but it was released in English as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. <br/><br/>Millennium trilogy is one of the world's best sellers. Three novels were translated to over 40 languages and sold 27 million copies. Larsson stated that the main source of inspiration in create the character of Lisbeth, was Sweden's most beloved heroine of children literature, Pippi Long Stocking by Astrid Lindgren. I would add Pippi the survivor of nightmarish horrible childhood ... I have not read the books yet but I most certainly will and I will be waiting for the rest of the movies' release. I am intrigued by Lisbeth's dark sides as much as her brilliant intellect and her personality. She is the best part of the film and I want to learn more about her."

","If reviewers think that a movie with a tedious (3 hours) story line made up primarily of a how to guide to sadomasochism, bondage and discipline, serial rape and serial murder is a great movie it makes me really sad. I would have walked out of the movie but I did not want to embarrass my friends who brought me to see it. The sex was simulated but the violence was very explicit. There were numerous scenes of torture as well. While many felt the movie was well acted and well directed I would also disagree. The motivations of the characters were very unclear. For the most part the only emotions people showed were hate and glee over causing others physical pain on the one hand and the screams of physical pain by the victims on the other. As a matter of fact the emotions people showed were closer to those seen in a psycho ward. However, I do think the reason there is so poor character development and motivation is due to bad acting and directing. I must admit I do not understand why people go to bull fights either just to see animals being tortured.<br/><br/>Since I first posted this review, I have read the last two books of the Millennium Trilogy. They are masterpieces. I disagree quite emphatically with those who say the pictures follow the books. Stieg Larsson through his translator, carefully develops characters and the violence while it does occur is a minor part of the books. The most glaring difference is the nuance of the books. The books are spy, murder detective thrillers to be sure, but the underlying purpose of the books is to promote a scathing indictment of Swedish society after the cold war. Each volume tackles a different aspect of Swedish society. Human trafficking, internal secret police operations and corruption in the corporate world."

","Based on the novel of the same name by Steig Larsson, having a title such as Men Who Hate Women clearly states that the film is disturbing. There are two main characters. Mikael Bloomkvist, a disgraced and humiliated journalist who is called upon by an ostracized member of the Vagner family to investigate the disappearance and possible murder of his niece Harriet. The other main character is the one that really grabs our attention. Lisbeth Salander, a strange, tattooed and pierced 24 year old who professionalizes in computer hacking. Her attention is fixed on violence against women, in which her own presence is a repeated victim of. A group of male thugs beat her, her guardian (which I don't remember why she needs him, but it's explaind in the later episodes) viciously and repeatedly rapes and beats her, all with no general reason except that she is a woman, living in a sadist man's world.<br/><br/>However, it becomes clear throughout the course of the film, that Lisbeth is a woman who does not take any crap from anyone. She scares the misogynist group of youths away with a broken bottle, screaming like a panther, leaving them shocked that she would defend herself and not succumb to their violence. She allows herself to get raped a second time only to video tape it, therefore using it against her rapist. She tortures him very brutally, sexually abusing him and tattooing him for what he really is, a sadist and a rapist pig. I found myself smiling when she did this.<br/><br/>She and Mikael come together in the middle of the film and they work on the case, leading them to shocking discoveries of brutal and hateful grisly murders, the story getting more and more twisted just like a normal good thriller should. Lisbeth is really the true heroine of the stories; a weird, strong and fascinating creature, played brilliantly by Noomi Rapace. The film, long, graphic, gory and very hard to watch and follow, is a brilliant Swedish masterpiece."

The movie doesn't shy away from graphically explaining the elements and harshness of the stories many plot lines from intersecting in a twist of movie making greatness. Noomi plays Lisbeth so close to the book that you think Steig wrote her character with Rapace in mind all the way. The best part of the movie is that you can then move right into the sequels without having to wait. Thankfully, the Swedish makers didn't wait in between films and released all three in the same year, 2009. The makers of the movie also did not dilute the movie or 'dumb it down'. It's an excellent movie based on some very disturbing themes."

","Shortly after receiving a six month jail sentence, which he won't start serving for six months, journalist Mikael Blomkvist receives an interesting job offer; Henrik Vanger, an elderly man, wants him to investigate the disappearance, and presumed murder, of his great niece who was last seen when she was sixteen in 1966. He is convinced that the killer must still be alive as somebody is sending him pictures of flowers each birthday just as she did; clearly somebody out there is taunting him. Before hiring him Henrik had Blomkvist checked out by a security company who employed young hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate him; she continues to show an interest in him and follows his investigations by hacking his laptop. She makes an important breakthrough and contacts him; after that they join up and continue an investigation that unearths murders of women going back to the '40s, Nazi sympathisers within Vanger's family and ultimately the realisation that the killings have not stopped and they are in grave danger.<br/><br/>That covers the core mystery but almost as important is Lisbeth's back story; we learn early on that she is in the official custody of a state appointed guardian who has the power to have her sent back to a psychiatric unit if she doesn't do what she is supposed to. When given a new guardian he uses this authority to force her into performing sexual favours and ultimately, in a particularly gruelling scene he rapes her. She shows her strength by later turning the tables on him; it isn't for some time though that we learn what her original offence was.<br/><br/>Having watched several Scandinavian TV dramas in the last few years I was keen to see this film; I must say I was not disappointed... although I do wish the subtitles had been a little larger! At two and a half hours it isn't a short film but I never found myself looking at the clock as the time flew by. The characters were great; particularly Blomkvist and Lisbeth; actors Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace did a fantastic job bringing the characters to life. The mystery itself was gripping and there were a few edge-of-seat moments when it looked as if one of the investigators might not survive. There are a couple of particularly gruelling scenes of a sexual nature, that earned the film its '18' certificate, which might put off some viewers however if you can get through those there isn't anything else too disturbing. Aside from having great characters and an interesting mystery the film looks great with beautiful Swedish winter scenery. I can't say how good an adaptation of the book this is or how it compares to the more recent English language remake but I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting a thriller that doesn't over rely on nonstop action or special effects."
"zardoz-13","10","3","4","20 December 2011"," Lurid but Gripping Mystery Thriller
","This lurid but engrossing mystery thriller about a cold-blooded killer who kills women for fun is riveting stuff from start to finish. Danish director Niels Arden Oplev helmed the first of the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium"" trilogy of thrillers. Clocking in at 153 minutes, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a gripping account of the search for a girl who mysteriously vanished and one of her relatives who hires a journalist who has just lost a libel suit against a billionaire industrialist to find her. Retired industrialist Henrik Vanger hires publisher of the Swedish political magazine Millennium, Mikael Blomkvist, to solve the 40 year disappearance of Henrik's great-niece. Henrik puts Blomkvist on this cold case based on a profile prepared for him by Lisbeth Salander, a computer whiz with a history of having been abused by her father. In flashbacks, we learn that Lisbeth set her abusive father aflame and she has been on probation since the incident. When she starts hacking into Blomkvist's computer to solve the mystery herself, the journalist contacts her and she joins him. Lisbeth knows a whole lot about abuse. Not only did her father take advantage of her, but she finds herself raped and sodomized by her new probation officer. Lisbeth turns the tables on the evil man when he ties her down to a bed and has his way with her. Little does he know that she has recorded a video of him ravishing her. Later, she gains the upper hand, ties him up, and tattoos on his stomach the words ""I am a sadistic pig and a rapist"" on his stomach. Eventually, as Blomkvist's investigation takes him dangerously close to the truth, the rest of the Vanger family objects, particularly after Henrik suffers a heart attack. Oplev doesn't waste a single second and you cannot take your eyes off Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is an unforgettable film."

","This Swedish crime chiller is based on the first of a trilogy of novels from Stieg Larsson. A dishonored tabloid journalist Mikael Blomkvist(Michael Nyqist)is hired by Henrik Vanger, a wealthy industrialist and patriarch of a close-knit dysfunctional family, to find his niece, who disappeared over forty years ago while an abused teen. Mikael, found guilty of defamation, starts his investigation and efforts are compromised by a young hacker named Lisbeth Salander(Noomi Rapace). The journalist allows the rebellious hacker to join in the deep search that uncovers dark secrets about the powerful Vanger family. Mikael and Lisbeth soon have to deal with keeping themselves alive. Three graphic scenes of sexual assault, a couple of erotic sex scenes, and a fair share of violence makes this dark mystery a very satisfying and intriguing couple of hours. Miss Rapace is not the most well endowed, but is not shy in showing why she is THE GIRL with the DRAGON TATTOO. Hard not to like this one. Also in the cast: Sven-Bertil Taube, Peter Haber, Lena Endre, Bjorn Granath and Ewa Froling. Filmed entirely in Sweden, except for a final scene shot in Spain."
"TxMike","Null","3","4","18 May 2011"," Well-crafted mystery, but Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander is the best reason to see this.
","My wife is a constant reader and she spoke highly of the trilogy of novels, the first being the book this movie was made from. So now we are in the process of watching all three, which were apparently all filmed in succession over about 18 months. We watched with the dubbed English sound track. The dubbing is done very well, fairly closely matching the mouth movements.<br/><br/>Michael Nyqvist is Mikael Blomkvist, investigative journalist who writes an expose' but appears to have been set up. His source materials either disappear or appear to be fakes, and is ultimately convicted of slander and scheduled to spend several months in jail.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, a very unusual 24-yr-old, short haircut, multiple piercings, and always in black, crosses Mikael's path. She is an expert computer hacker and insightful investigator on her own, and digs into his life. What she finds is that he in fact is innocent, an honest man. They eventually work together to solve a 40-yr-old mystery.<br/><br/>The mystery is the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, only 16, and since then presumed murdered. This happened in the 1960s, but a body was never found. The elder Vanger patriarch wants Mikael to investigate and solve the mystery. He believes one of the Vanger family members, which includes several Nazi sympathizers, must be the guilty party.<br/><br/>During this first movie we also get a glimpse of Lisbeth's past, which included a stay in a mental facility, and an overseer who abused her. We also see the video she made secretly, which is destined to show up again in the other movies.<br/><br/>All the characters are good, but I can't say enough about Rapace as Lisbeth. She creates a character as memorable as any. More closely akin to Nikita than anything else. This DVD has a 12 minute interview with her, in English. I am glad I saw the movie first, because Rapace in real life looks and acts nothing like Lisbeth. She made quite a transformation for the role.<br/><br/>Good movie, even though it is long at around 2 1/2 hours, I was always anxious for the next scene, the next development. Now I am interested in what the American remake will be, but I can't imagine that it will be as good as this one.<br/><br/>November 2019 edit: I just rewatched it, much of it seemed very fresh, I enjoyed it as much after 8+ years dormancy. Don't read the last paragraph below if you want to avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow, you may want to quit reading at this point: As the investigation into Harriet moved along, using old information and old negatives from the 1960s, plus notations in the back of Harriet's bible, Lisbeth figured out the notations referenced bible verses. This led to the realization that the murdered people were Jewish. Eventually this led to one of the Vanger men, and then figuring out that Harriet had fled before she too became a victim. They located her in Australia, brought her home for the reunion with her elderly uncle who was looking for closure before he died."

","I had never read the book, so my boyfriend and I had no idea of what to expect when we went after winning a first-screening pass. The actual plot was very good, but we ended up leaving early (after approximately 8 other people left before us)because of the intense sexual violence. I did think that aside from that, the movie would have been great. I think that the fact that so many people left ahead of us indicated that we were not the only ones who thought that the brutality of at least two of the scenes was too much too handle. The acting was very good, and the characters personalities drew you into the picture right away. I do think that this movie should get at least a restricted rating."

","Noomi is such a great actress that she's the only one to make me break my promise of not buying anymore DVD as long as I haven't finished to watch all my collection. That's why I can review it now in the middle of my TV shows DVD. <br/><br/>What i knew about ""Millenium"" was nothing but it reached my radar by a past colleague who has read the books. I remember also to see the poster in the subway and it made me think about the singer of the group rock Indochine. But, it's only with ""Prometheus"" that I have discovered Noomi as a very promising young actress. <br/><br/>Thus, she gave me a ticket for a noir trip in Sweden and it's good. Living in the so-called European Union, i have always wondered why in France, we never have the movies from our cousins. Thus, it's a miracle to have a Swedish blockbuster, all the more than in our all-visual society, it's again a book that has started it. <br/><br/>Going to Stockholm was a come-back for me because i used to visit a friend there and i think i have been in a few locations. In all cases, the movie is a fine production with beautiful landscapes and great insight about Swedish way of life. The investigation is interesting because it mixes old past with brand new technology and if you pay attention, you can understand what happens, which is not the case in a lot of movies. Sure, some moments are a bit flat (the abuse, the family reaction, the pursuit, the flowers gifts) but at last, the tension and the mystery is ever present. <br/><br/>About the cast, this Swedish team is excellent and proves that there's a life outside Hollywood, which is paradoxically what Noomi is actually seeking. There, she was perfectly cast because as i have seen in ""Prometheus"", she exudes an inner rage, a survival instinct, a raw sensibility that made me think to the young De Niro. This wasp character is also interesting to discover because she isn't really into talks. You really have to be patient to reach her and as the film ends, you really want to follow this strange couple into their next adventures!"

","Somewhere along the way, the detective genre in both books and movies has drifted. In the formative period where the form was strong enough to stick, the idea was a to create an engaging puzzle. The narrative was the thing and the game was to sort out the causal agency among possibilities in a sort of quantum logic. Other than the recurring detective, characters and settings were there to color the puzzle. In fact, filling them out would reveal their inner motivations, and that had to be kept hidden.<br/><br/>Then I suppose in the late 70s, detective fiction became what the publicists called ""psychological."" The genre bumped up against the procedural. Readers lost the desires and skills required to play the simple game, so the game evolved into what I call a vocabulary of folding devices. In the process, detective storytelling started getting judged by the same rules as ordinary drama, for better or worse.<br/><br/>Those rules may overemphasize character definition. We have to have an absurdly sharp but easily described set of ghosts that haunt every character that matters. Mix that with Lutheran Swedish filmmaking and you end up with something like this. The mood is refined and disturbing. The camera does not probe because we expect the characters to project to us. People are damaged, seriously damaged and they spread it around themselves. Cold is the same as gloom.<br/><br/>I have not read the book. It is possible that the language used there is able to bridge the inner cosmos of our two detectives and the world they are discovering. Surely the matter is the same: sexual violence. (Blomkvist's situation here is not quite clear; a lover at work may have helped frame him.)<br/><br/>Anyway, you get two movies. Visually and tone-wise you have the heavy Bergman. There is no mystery or coherent story outside the characters. The characters are cartoons, so outside our experience that they cannot connect, only display.<br/><br/>The only engaging things were the stories within: the photos primarily.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","There is certain view regarding European cinema as sophisticated and intellectual. So on one side is the high art - i.e. European cinema, on the other - commercial hot-dog avatars shoot in the US of A. It is sometimes true, sometimes not, but as a consequence both the audience and critics seems to look at European production already expecting some artistry to be there. Sometimes there is some art there indeed but more then often there isn't much, and ""The girl with a dragon tattoo"" here is unfortunately an example of the more common case. The problem is, once the critic gets into this ""state of expectation"" it's sort of easy to fool her or him with a lousy and pseudo-artsy movie.<br/><br/>One thing is good in this otherwise very mediocre production - the pictures by Jens Fisher and Eric Kress. The way they shoot light on snow is remarkable and to them I am truly grateful since otherwise I would have totally lost 150 minutes of my life. The storyline is 100% cliché, how many movies about psychotic killers hiding between rich have we seen? How many about revenge for personal issues? How many mixing these two threads? How very original. About the ultra right twist - there are much better Swedish books - yes, mystery too - dealing with this subject: Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö wrote some of the really good ones already in the 60's. <br/><br/>Neither is ""The girl"" a good mystery. If you force yourself into paying attention , if you somehow managed to focus, the answer to the puzzle is blatantly revealed in about 1/3 of the movie, then you just get bored and irritated looking at both heroes playing really dumb. One of the reason why you wouldn't want to pay attention is rather poor acting, especially from Noomi Rapace, not that Michael Nyqvist is much butter - just watch him jogging, probably his best acting in the whole movie, The other reason - the movie is unnecessary looooong, mostly due to some really gross scenes that carry zero importance for the main plot but effectively change the genre from mystery into something close to exploitation, gore-shock films. ""The girl"" pretends to be sort of realistic flick, the same way Mou Tun Fei's ""Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre"" does, and just the same there are people that have a taste for it (or to be precise, a lack of taste whatsoever). Shall the rape and torture scenes be cut off, the audience would get a decent, forgettable mystery, a bit below the original Swedish Wallander series; the way it is we got some pretentious, boring BS, with scenes that can excite only some poor, tormented souls. Oh, and let us not forget about the glorious epilogue, honestly, how low it can go?<br/><br/>One last thing - I use the term ""porn"" the way Eco ones defined - if for the most of the movie the viewer is just waiting for sth to happen while watching boring stuff, this is definitely a porn movie."

","I watched this movie with my brother about 10 days ago at the cinema. I didn't have any expectations. I hadn't read the book, and I hadn't heard anything about the film, except for the title several times. After seeing the movie, me and my brother talked about it while going home. We agreed totally on our opinions: It was a poor crime story, full of clichés and OK acting, but nothing more.<br/><br/>The story actually reminded me a bit about the story in The DaVinci Code. Two people, one middle-aged man and a far younger woman, a murder case with religious elements in it, things that happened a long time ago that are suddenly and mysteriously revealed during the movie, etc etc.<br/><br/>This movie was full of clichés, and the story about Lisbeth and her sponsor (or whatever he was), didn't have anything to do with the rest of the story. It was just an isolated story put into the book/movie to show another ""man who hates women"". The scenes with them that was supposed to be disturbing (blowjob scene, rape scene), was not disturbing enough at all, and in the end she gets her revenge anyways, without anything more happening to further ticken the plot, or play a part later on in the movie, so there's really no point to this isolated story, if you ask me. Just a meaningless story written for the audience to love, because the little girl actually gets her revenge this time. Yay!.. It's just so typically mainstream-shallow. <br/><br/>When it comes to the the rest of the story, that is, the main story, I don't know how much I wanna dig into the details etc, so I'll just keep it simple and sweet: It was shallow as mentioned. It was full of the typical crime/detective/mystery murder case clichés, plus, of course, the stereotypes. You have this Lisbeth character for example, who's supposed to be young, conflicted, unhappy, maybe a bit traumatized, cold or closed or whatever, but very intelligent (which is not so unusual or unrealistic for persons which fit this kind of description). What I thought was so unrealistic and stereotyped, was that she was able to work as hard as she did, and put up such a good fight to whoever she ran into (or whoever ran into her), and the whole character was just supposed to be observed by the viewer, as someone you don't fully understand, someone that makes you think, whatever. I don't know, but I just thought the whole character portrait failed, partly because of her acting, but mostly because of the character itself.<br/><br/>There's a lot of other things I could mention, like the murderer himself and how ridiculously unoriginal that whole thing was, but I'll just end it now before this gets too long..<br/><br/>-Totally clichéd and predictable story. -OK acting, but somewhat weak at times. -Stereotypes that are easy to read and understand, even though you're not supposed to understand them. -Obviously meant for the mainstream audience, especially for those in their mid-40's to mid-60's.<br/><br/>I'm seriously giving this movie 1 out of 10 stars, and take my advice if you've seen good movies before and know how to watch a movie: STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!..."

","Although this is much better than the usual slew of Swedish cinematic mysteries, a few queries must be made: why always inject the same actors in Swedish film? Why is their ""acting"" confined to existing, just like wooden objects - most notably Mikael Nyqvist - and not in an interesting IKEA way, even? Why is women still being portrayed as in this film? The low-down of the film is this: a journalist is sentenced to jail for slander, but gets a job from the very rich head of a corporation: find his niece. At the same time, a goth tries to make her way by digging up info on people for magazines, while combatting her demons from the past, which means she has to deal with an abusive counsellor which is obligatory if she's not to be ""shipped off to the mental institution, and we wouldn't want that now, would we?"". Seems to me that in the world of film-making - largely controlled by older men - girls who are individuals, who refuse to conform and basically do things the way that men go about (unpunished) get what this girl gets in the film. All the while, she gets entangled with said journalist and they try to solve the case together. I'm told the books are very well-written, but watching this is like watching the husk of same old Swedish mystery film of the past years re-juvenating for yet another Swedish mystery film. With the same actors. And their same old wooden selves."

The acting was on par with a television production as well. Tori Spelling would have been more credible in nearly every role. Some of the scenery was nice, and I like how he filmed the various bridges they drove back and forth over.<br/><br/>I can give Oplev credit for one significant feat: he has single-handedly proved that there are some butt-ugly Scandinavians! Michael Nyqvist could probably beat Tommy Lee Jones in the Worst-Acne-Scarring-Evah contest. Noomi Rapace has the body of Iggy Pop with breasts, and one facial expression. One.

Personally I have not read the book, but I must admit that I had quite the high expectations for this picture.<br/><br/>It really manages to keep the interest level up all through the movie, but although it fails to bore me I cannot help but feeling that it could have been made better. First of all, I think that it really is easy to predict the storyline while seeing. For the observant viewer this may turn out as a moment of irritation; especially when the dialogue seems to reveal the progression before the viewer gets to independently think or even make up his/her mind. In other words, I think the creators underestimates the viewer (or perhaps are targeting a larger amount of viewers).<br/><br/>Second, I really don't see what the big fuzz around the story is! Well, as I told, I haven't read the book, but the story presented in the picture is not that original and interesting that I thought. But that's my opinion, because I think the extremes aren't shocking enough compared to what is needed in todays media world.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I also think there are too many clichés and shortcuts in the plot.<br/><br/>On the positive record, there are some very good scenes, and the main actors are doing a good performance. Not extraordinary, but surely good acting. This, accompanied with the tensity the movie maintains throughout I'll give this a rating of 6,5 of 10."
"secondtake","8","5","9","14 July 2010"," A pair of amazing performances and a circuitous whodunnit
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009)<br/><br/>An ambitious, complex (at first), offbeat Swedish thriller. There are some really refreshing aspects, not the least is the two main characters, who are not the stereotypes that American (and British) movies seem to be trapped into. That is, these two are really interesting, and driven to succeed, and not just pretty or suave or sexualized. So we focus on the plot for its own sake, and the characters for theirs, avoiding at least some of the threadbare clichés of this kind of step by step detective/conspiracy thriller.<br/><br/>At first the story will seem overly convoluted, but it's nice to remember those certain movies where you have to trust the story to explain itself over time, which it does. Movies that don't dumb down, which this one doesn't. There are, unfortunately, some apparently necessary familiarities with uncovering a crime, like photos that get blown up to reveal new details, and tie-ins with mythic or medieval sources (in this case, an old Bible). And the mistreatment of women. There is also a sense that the perpetrator, since he or she isn't known to the viewer, is a bit abstract, and not, until the end, a threat.<br/><br/>This throws our attention on the quest for information, and on the two leads. The idealistic reporter, played by Michael Myquist, and the counter culture corporate spy, a young woman with piercings and a troubled past, played by Noomi Rapace, are absolutely first rate. They underplay their rather juicy parts. Admiration goes especially for Rapace, who could have hammed this up terribly, or just cheapened her role, but she does a prize-winning twist on all that, and you come to like her more and more as it goes.<br/><br/>The last two minutes? Boy I hated that. It's as if a certain honesty and love of pure truth and justice is thrown out the window for glitz and artifice. But wow, the two and a half hours up to that point are riveting, wonderful stuff. And American viewers should know that this is just the first third of a trilogy, already filmed and released in Sweden, so there's still a wild, intelligent ride ahead."
"ODDBear","8","5","9","25 July 2009"," Top notch Swedish suspense film
","As a virgin coming into this film; I was very impressed. Having heard nothing but great things said about the book, expectations were pretty high but the film delivered.<br/><br/>The mystery is a good one; yes, somewhat clichéd as far as the bible quotes are concerned but well written, suspenseful and always interesting. It's a nice touch how clues are always scattered about and some really insightful viewers may pick up on it.<br/><br/>Now the characters; Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) is the disgraced journalist who, thanks to his dogged dedication in pursuit of the truth no matter what the cost, gets lured in by a wealthy man to try and solve a forty year old mystery. Lisbeth Salander (Rapace) is the emotionally scarred, tattoo filled and pierced computer hacker who eventually teams up with Blomkvist in his search for the truth. These are two interesting characters, somewhat a cliché if you want to focus on the negative but well played out; especially Lisbeth who we'll probably get to know better in subsequent films. Blomkvist somewhat takes a backseat to Lisbeth but the two complement each other very well.<br/><br/>Along with being a good mystery and suspense film; ""Man som hatar kvinnor"" is also quite the brutal film, with excessive scenes of rape, beating and utmost humiliation. While somewhat tough to watch, they don't feel out of place and do enhance the plight of one of it's main characters.<br/><br/>Technical credits here are also top notch. Terrific cinematography and beautiful scenery abound here, top notch music score as well. All actors come off well, particularly Rapace as Lisbeth.<br/><br/>If they do as well with the subsequent films in the series we're well on our way to a great Swedish trilogy of suspense films; and that's only a good thing.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"johno-21","8","6","12","9 February 2010"," Dark thriller
","I saw this last month at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival where it played to full theaters. The novel by Stieg Larsson from which this film was adapted is heavily stocked in large American bookstores and I would assume many who went to the screenings had read the novel. I had not read the book but I did talk with several who did and although they liked the novel better and felt it was too difficult to condense the book into a two and half hour movie they did like the on screen adaptation by Nikilaj Arcel and Ramus Heisterberg. Two and a half hours may seem long to some but this film keeps your interest throughout and even though it may seem slow at times I did like its pacing. directed by Niels Arden Oplev this is the story of Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Myqvist) who is a disgraced investigative journalist who is awaiting a prison sentence. He is hired by an aging tycoon Henrik Vander (Sven-Bertil Taube) to do what the police couldn't and solve the disappearance of his niece nearly 40 years before. He is aided by a goth computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who is a genius at investigations herself. This unlikely combination takes on the unsavory Vander family that is filled with Nazi sympathizers. There are some disturbing violent scenes in this dark thriller that may not be suitable to some. Nyqvist, who seems to be in almost every Swedish movie made is kind of stiff in this role but Rapace is intriguing. Nice production design by Niels Sejer and music score from Jacob Groth. This will play in American art houses and expect an American remake. I would recommend it an give it an 8.0 out of 10."
"ally_d25","8","4","7","16 April 2010"," Tantalising, engaging thriller...
","""People always have secrets. It's just a matter of finding out what they are.""<br/><br/>Forty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from a family gathering on the island owned and inhabited by the powerful Vanger clan. Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder and that the killer is a member of his own tightly knit but dysfunctional family. He employs disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, ruthless computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate. But the Vanger's are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.<br/><br/>Based on the immensely popular novel by Stieg Larsson, 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is the first of three films based on Larsson's bestselling 'Millenium Trilogy'. At 2 hours and 32 minutes long, 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a tantalising, engaging crime thriller that doesn't let up until the credits roll.<br/><br/>The film's score can be heard before a picture is even seen on screen and sets the tone for the entire movie. What can be heard is a soundtrack that is simultaneously foreboding whilst also creating a sense of urgency. The score continues in much of the same vein for the duration of the film, in that it manages to convey dual emotions, and is uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>The casting of Noomi Rapace as the girl who has the dragon tattoo, Lisbeth Salander, was a stroke of brilliance. Though her character isolates herself and is unsociable, to say the least, Rapace has created an engaging, endearing, likable, piercing character, managing to convey subtle emotions and who holds your attention from the moment she walks on screen. There are no scenes in which Rapace shies away from the task at hand and she's a standout. Michael Nyqvist, with the lesser of the two lead roles, is likable but slightly overshadowed. However, he gives a perfectly acceptable performance. Between the two lead actors there's also a to-and-fro sort of chemistry that works on several levels.<br/><br/>The movie's script is solid. At all times what's being said on screen is interesting and the need to fill every little moment with dialogue doesn't appear in this film. Instead, the script wisely leaves moments of silence which, when coupled with what's occurring on screen, creates a dynamic happening. The script manages to give clues without revealing too much, leaving the details of the final twist to be a shock.<br/><br/>Overall, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an absorbing film that's well worth watching, even if you don't particularly like foreign films."
"jonathanruano","10","5","10","1 September 2010"," One of the Ten Best Films of 2009
","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is probably one of the most daring and original films ever made and easily one of the ten best films made in 2009. This is a film with several different plot lines - one about a very gifted, but anti-social and violent, outsider named Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who eventually triumphs over amazing odds, another about a brilliant and gutsy journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nvqvist) who takes a chance on a daring story, loses his reputation and liberty and then searches for a comeback, and another about a millionaire Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) who, before he dies, wants to find out who murdered his daughter Harriet - that all come together in surprising, original and creative ways. This film is also a murder mystery which is so complex and profound that it is engrossing to watch Blomkvist and Salander work together in trying to solve it.<br/><br/>What I find remarkable about this movie is that Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev and writer Nikolaj Arcel are able to take all these different plot lines and create a uniform masterpiece out of it with great cinematography (and there are some really good images in this movie) to boot. And yes the movie lasts for 2 hours and 30 minutes, but I can say unequivocably that this film is so interesting that I did not notice those 150 minutes go by. Furthermore, the performances in this movie are incredible. Noomi Rapace brings to her performance an intellectual brilliance and frenetic energy - as evidenced even by the little things like smoking one cigarette after the next or the abrupt way she interacts with others - that makes the character Lisbeth Salander fascinating to watch. Michael Nyqvist is also wonderful as the journalist Blomkvist who develops the most unexpected, but nonetheless believable, relationship with Salander. But even my assessment here does not give this film its proper due. I feel like telling everyone don't ask me about the plot and don't ask me about the characters. Just watch the movie and experience it for yourself. I would recommend ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" to anyone, except to those under the age of 18 since they are likely to be very disturbed by the graphic scenes in this picture. This is a film for adults. Thumbs way up."

It is very slow, and has a couple of graphic scenes.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in modern day Sweeden. An old rich man pays a middle aged reporter (Mikael) at the end of his career to find his niece who disappeared when she was 16 in 1966.

"dave-sturm","9","5","10","3 April 2010"," Differences between book and movie
","This is only intended for Americans who have just now seen the subtitled Swedish movie, which only opened this weekend, and have not read the book and are curious if the two differ.<br/><br/>The movie is about 95 percent faithful to the novel. Having read the novel, I was surprised how true the movie was to Stieg Larsson's intricate, but understandable, plot.<br/><br/>But there are differences.<br/><br/>For one thing, Erika Berger, who is a major character in the novel, is merely depicted as the person in charge of the Millennium magazine's office. She's the attractive middle aged woman who kisses Blomqvist after following him as he leaves the office early in the movie. In the book, she and Blomqvist have been having a torrid affair for years. And she is married. And her husband tolerates the affair (those Swedes!).<br/><br/>This has a significant impact on the ending of the novel. What is not depicted in the movie is that Lisbeth Salander has fallen in love with Blomqvist by the end and goes out to buy him a very thoughtful gift for when he gets out of prison. But when she approaches his place with the gift, she sees him and Erika coming out of his apartment laughing, kissing, arm-in-arm. It breaks Lisbeth's heart to see this and she tosses the gift into a Dumpster. That's how the novel ends.<br/><br/>The part about Lisbeth spending her stolen fortune on a tropical vacation is actually the beginning of the second novel, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire,"" which sends Salander and Blomqvist off on a new adventure a year after the end of events in the first novel.<br/><br/>""Dragon Tattoo"" contains intriguing hints about Salander's early life. Why was she in a mental hospital? Who was the man she set on fire? All this is explained in the second novel, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" as we learn all about Salander's ugly life story. And believe me, it is ugly. If any woman in fiction has earned the right to vengeance, it is Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>I have read all three in the Millennium trilogy. I can testify that if you liked ""Dragon Tattoo,"" book or movie, you will love ""Played With Fire,"" which is the best of the three novels and the most action packed.<br/><br/>The third novel, ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" is actually a sequel to ""Played with Fire."" In fact, ""Hornet's Nest"" begins at the moment ""Played with Fire"" ends.<br/><br/>The last two novels have already been filmed in Sweden and await release in the U.S. And as we know now, ""Dragon Tattoo"" is due for an American remake for release in 2012. Presumably, Hollywood will also film the entire trilogy.<br/><br/>I seen postings bemoaning an American remake. I am not among them. I envision six movies featuring Lisbeth Salandar and, to me, that's pure bliss. One down, five to go.<br/><br/>How tragic that Stieg Larsson cannot give us another book. He died of a heart attack before he even saw the publication of his trilogy, much less see his writings become the stuff of fiction and movie legend."

","In one of the most pleasant surprises to grace the screens in 2010, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (or if you prefer, Män som hatar kvinnor) is one of the best films of the year so far. Director Niels Arden Oplev has placed a stamp on foreign and independent cinema in a big way that I haven't seen since Fernando Mierelles blazed the screens with City of God. <br/><br/>Oplev's Swedish-language film, based on the popular book series by the late Stieg Larsson, and adapted for the screen by Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg, tells the story of a journalist and a female computer hacker, who's paths cross in order to solve a 40-year old missing person case within a powerful and corrupt family, where no one trusts no one. The film is such a terrific and smart thriller, encapsulating all the great things about the mystery genre into one tightly wrapped cinematic experience.<br/><br/>One of the most spectacular things to come out of the film is the breakthrough and stellar performance of newcomer Noomi Rapace, who sizzles in her role as ""Lisbeth Salander,"" the guarded yet vulnerable computer genius, who finds herself drawn to the honorable ""Mikael Blomkvist"" played tenderly by Mihcael Nyqvist. Rapace bares her soul in the complex Lisbeth, which allows her to keep the audience at a distance, never allowing us near unless she gives permission. It's a rare experience in film to feel so distant from a character yet yearn and fight to be close and understand them, that's the achievement of Rapace's performance.<br/><br/>Nyqvist is the film's Knight in shining armor, trusting himself to the character and laying it down so effortlessly. He gains the trust and admiration of the audience early on and sustains it for the long runtime of 2 hours and 34 minutes. The rest of the cast, all turn in superb and fierce performances from the grotesque family members to the heinous and evil parole guardian, you will find yourself on a emotional roller-coaster.<br/><br/>What the film does is set the pace and the excitement for the future adaptations of the series, The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, all slated for releases in the next year. Hopefully with its very independent and limited release, a honorable movie-goer can experience the new generation of mystery films standing next to the greatness of Alfred Hitchcock's infamous thrillers in his career. Oplev and his writing team reinvent the genre and raise it to new levels.<br/><br/>***½/****"

The film is dark yet brightly shot and directed. The main characters of Lisbeth and Micke are really well acted and very believable. I like to be shocked and scared and this film provided on both counts. It has a fair amount of adult content and sexual violence but this is totally relevant to the story and nature of Lisbeth's character.

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","6","13","28 May 2009"," The Pleasure of despair
","It's a thriller that comes from the northern long winter Scandinavian nights. The rhythm then is slow, but the story is packed with suspense and logical absurd illogicality. The illogicality of criminal minds. It is also Swedish under another light. It is interested in the past, during Hitler's tenure but also after that tenure, after the second world war. In an industrial family with four brothers, three of them turn Nazi, and in modern times, when the story starts and the brother who did not turn Nazi is trying to find out a niece of his who disappeared in the early 60s, one of the three is completely gaga and a recluse, and the other two are no longer present. The business is in the hands of the son of one of the three (who died the day or so when the niece who was his daughter disappeared) and he seems to be a nice gentleman. The main character, a journalist hired to do the job by the non-Nazi brother, finds out his computer is visited by a hacker who sends him some info about his investigation. The two are pairing on the case and find out the truth which is brutal and grossly rude. No details about that. You have to see the film. But the film is fascinating because of this very mesmerizing power of that guilty past that survives even in the present. A Nazi monster will always be a Nazi monster and he will train his own son into the same barbarity. In fact he is a Nazi out of historical coincidence. He is a criminal first of all and he is thankful when history gives him the opportunity to be a criminal hero. The film though is a little bit short about that killer of women being a hater of women. It is generally slightly more complex. Actually the surviving criminal will confess before committing his last crime that it is not hatred for women because he rapes them, he is even demonstrating to them some humane gestures because he is attracted by the hope these victims entertain in those moments and he thoroughly enjoys the feeling he reads in his victims' eyes when they realize there is no hope, they are going to be killed. He finds his pleasure in these silent sentiments and feelings he drinks from the eyes of his victims as if it were some liquor. That's where the film is stronger than we may think. It shows how these criminals have perverted their pleasure into finding it in the utter hatred of their own victims that is only the last light in their eyes when all hope is gone. That's probably what a SS felt in Auschwitz. Sweden is haunted by this past that is shown as being still perfectly present. I am kind of inclined to say that there is no hope because such criminals will always exist and they must be kept away from any lethal tool that they could use on living beings, with the supreme perversion of killing themselves in the very process of killing scores of other people, suicide terrorists and their suicide attacks. The inventor of that kind of terrorism that transformed some volunteers into perambulating killing bombs has just found his human end in Sri Lanka, Prabhakaran, of Maoist inspiration. There is no way to prevent such derangement in some people, we can only do as much as we can to identify them, keep them under surveillance and give them no official occasion to cultivate and satisfy their perversion under some official uniform.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"

","I watched Män som hatar kvinnor at the cinema earlier this day. Right now I'm probably one of the few people in Sweden that have never read any of Stieg Larsson's books so I entered the cinema without any expectations on how it should be. I had read a few reviews that seemed rather positive. When I left the cinema I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist who receives the mission to solve a 40 year old disappearance. A girl, Harriet, disappeared in 1966 and now her uncle, the 82 year old businessman Henrik Vanger, gives Nykvist the mission to solve this mystery. To his help he has Lisbet Salander, an EMO and a computer hacker with a troubled past that we see glimpses of throughout the film. The story is always exciting, new clues are given all the time and we don't get to know the guilty until the end. There are several intensive scene, the most intensive is probably the rape scene towards the start. Now I don't want to give away to much to those who read this review, but trust me when I say that there aren't any slow moments.<br/><br/>Basically the whole acting élite in Sweden has been assembled (it feels as if only Mikael Persbrandt is missing). They all play their roles very well which is quite an accomplishment considering that there is a certain risk for overacting. Noomi Rapace as Lisbet Salander is especially impressing, her role could have become a caricature of the troubled and destructive EMO girl but none of that is a problem in this film. Salander becomes a living human being. Peter Haber deserves to be mentioned. Here he showed that he deserves better than to eternally portray Martin Beck the policeman.<br/><br/>My brother, who had read the book before, told me that they had removed some parts of the plot. Of course that's expected from a film adaptation, and I suspect the film did not loose out on it. On the contrary, it seemed like they removed some unnecessary details that only would have dragged down the pace. He also told me something interesting. He said that when he reached the cellar scene at the end he thought: ""Oh no! This book was so good, and now you end it with this unrealistic over-the-top scene!"" A few days later, he read the first media reports about the Fritzl case.<br/><br/>This scene is connected to the only thing that somewhat annoys me with this film. All businessmen, except for Henrik, are portrayed as criminals. At the very least they are liars who do not hesitate to send innocent people to jail. The rest are Nazis and/or sadistic killers. I know that not are families are happy ones but this becomes a bit to much of a caricature of the corrupted family of businessmen.<br/><br/>I would like to finish with something else I liked. (MINOR SPOILER) The film often departs from convention. After Salander and Blomkvist have made love I expected them to stay in bed and have some serious discussions about their lives and society in general. Instead, Salander leaves the bed and goes out of the room with a rather surprised Blomkvist shouting after her: ""What?! Where are you going now?!"" That made the audience laugh."

","When I was looking at the selection of films that were available at the local BlockBusters that a friend of mine has recently joined,I instantly noticed the cover to a film that I wanted to view right away,called The Girl who Played with Fire.But,due to a friend of my dads telling me that it was the second part to a film that had the very intriguing title of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,I decided to take the risk of getting both parts that are currently out at once,with hardly knowing anything about the highly-praised novels or characters.After having seen this two and a half hour epic first film,I feel that it is one of the best film- related decisions that I have made in the last few years... The Plot:<br/><br/>After having lost a huge court case,over articles printed in Millennium magazine about arms trading, investigative journalist,and Millennium editor Mikael Bloomkvist decides to stay underground,in hopes that if he does go to jail,the Millennium magazine wont fold.How ever,during the Christmas period Mikael gets a phone call,from an old family friend asking him to come visit him.When Bloomkvist arrives,he is told that a girl who used to babysit him was kidnapped decades ago.With the man telling Mikael that he has tried everything that he could do to find her,but he now feels that the only option that he has left is to ask Bloomkvist to look at the case.Meanwhile,a goth Cyber Punk called Lisbeth Salander has been given a job at hacking into Mikaels computer,to look into his activates.When she discovers the case that he is working on,Salander starts sending Bloomkvist cryptic E-Mails.Due to Mikarel surprisingly,being easily able to find her IP address,he goes to visit Salander,to tell her to stop hacking into his computer,and to instead work with him as a partner.Although she is at first very hesitant to, (due to having experience a lot of abuse from men in her life)Mikarel slowly starts to build up a working (and trusting) relationship with Lisbeth.Although they both soon discover,that what seems to be a one missing person case,is in fact something a lot more disturbing... View on the film:<br/><br/>The people who I think glow the most (like a new tattoo) with this film.are,the screenwriters Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaja Arcels.Whoses amazing screenplay makes the very twisting story in the film, impossible to pause from for even a minute.And though I do have to say that the original title that author Stieg Larsson gave to the book,was not exactly the most subtle title that I have ever heard (Men who hate Women-which is one of the main issues that the film series looks at)The script has a very strong amount of subtlety,with some of the main clues to the ending of the film being put right at the very beginning of the film,which are more noticeable on repeat viewings of the movie. With the murder mystery of the film, I strongly feel that this astonishing screenplay, is one of the most thrilling stories that I have seen this year, with all of the cyber hacking parts, not being filled with time wasting made-up techno babble,and the clues in the film to the murderer (such as one of the best parts in the film being the ""moving images"" section)being completely gripping.<br/><br/>From the very first moments of the film,I was instantly struck by the performance of Noomi Rapace as Lizbeth Salander.In an interview with her on the DVD (that I watched after the film) I was shocked to see how much of a physical change Rapace had done for the role,with her beautiful feminine appearance,being replaced by a very masculine,Gothic look.Along with her impressive physical change,Noomi gives a stunning performance,by always smartly making sure that Lizbeth never turns into a ""woe is me"" kind of character,but instead is someone who is damaged,yet extremely determined to ruin the people that tried to destroy her.Whilst Rapace is understandably praised,I feel that the performance of Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist is very under rated.Whilst there are a few things that the character does that feels a bit out of place (Im not that sure how many investigated journalist would know how to handle a gun)Nyqvist does a great job at showing Mikael not looking down on Salander,or trying to be some sort of ""uncle"" to her. Instead,he makes the characters investigation skills something that is very focus and précis.The relationship that Blomkvist has with Lizbeth,is performed by Nyqvist impressively not as condescending,but as someone who seems to be really trying to get Salander to see that he really wants her to have a stable friendship with him,and that he treats her as an equally to himself.Although there are a few signs that he may be looking for something with her,that is more than a ""friendship"".<br/><br/>Although the film does feature some violent,or very aggressive moments (Slaanders meetings with her ""welfare officer"",are easily the most disturbing parts in the film.)Impressively director Niels Arden Oplev,does a fantastic job at making the nastier parts of the film never feel out of place,or not being related to the characters struggles.Instead,the scenes help to show (especially in the last half an hour of the film) how Lisbeth and Mikaels partnership,completely complements each character individually,and as a whole.One of the most surprising scenes in the film for me was the sex scene,with Opley doing a clever role-reversal,by having Bloomkvist be the one who seems to have at least a little bit of a desire for there relationship to now become a bit more personal,whilst Salander treats the time that they slept together,as not that important,and as normal as making a cup of tea!.Also,I have to say that the voice dubbing with the film,is by far the strongest and most natural sounding dub that I have ever heard for a film. Final view on the film:<br/><br/>An astonishingly gripping mystery-thriller,with a fantastic script,stunning performances of unforgettable characters all done with great directing by Oplev."

","My wife rented this one from our local library. I remembered reading Roger Ebert's review of the sequel ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" and being intrigued by this one. I personally am a huge fan of foreign films having seen entries from Mexico, Japan, Germany, Spain Italy and China but other than Bergman's ""Fanny and Alexander"" I was unfamiliar with Swedish cinema. I think it is the best film I have seen this year, a Swedish ""The Silence of the lambs"". It is much darker than anything Hollywood puts out but to European audiences the graphic violence and nudity i'm sure is fairly routine. The two leads Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace are brilliant with Rapace especially deserving mention. Her Lisbeth Salander is the year's most nuanced female performance. When she is on screen you cannot take your eyes off her. Hollywood is already planning a remake of this to be directed by David Fincher. It can't top this one and no other actress on the planet can play Lisbeth after Noomi Rapace. If you can handle the subtitles and the graphic violence plus the 2 hour and 25 minute run time you won't see a more compelling piece of cinema this year."
"jzappa","8","4","8","5 September 2010"," Public Justice, Private Happiness
","I'm always ready to censure the MPAA in whatever way I can. When they say, ""Strong brutal violence including a rape,"" we think, well rape is strong brutal violence! You could've just said strong brutal violence without giving anything away! But in the case of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I'm beginning to see why they make that distinction. I could've seen someone get killed with seven chainsaws and not be as disturbed as I was by the rape scene that occurs a few minutes short of an hour into this surprisingly standard but strangely bewildering film. This rape is foreshadowed by a forced blowjob. The man is in knowingly and insatiably sadistic control of the woman. Then comes the rape proper. It goes on longer than it needs to in order to make the point that this woman is brutally raped. What is it telling us? An emotional point of reference, I believe, for the unraveling of the investigative plot later to come.<br/><br/>Walking into this film adaptation of one of the most astonishing literary success stories in years, I was excited because of my previous experiences with Swedish cinema. The subtleties, the artfulness, the minimalism especially. Bergman, Sjostrom, Kaurismaki. I was off-put by the very mainstream American handling of the story, which is frankly, on the surface, quite an American creation. It's a mystery thriller, two unlikely underdog heroes teamed up to crack an ongoing case. And that's great! But there is also an edge to this story not unlike Mike Yanagita's scene in Fargo. During the story, we are subjected to seemingly extraneous chronicles of pure evil, harrowing brutality and subtext that seems constrained by the otherwise tight clockwork of the case-solving plot.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I am continually intrigued by said unorthodoxy of its structure. I have yet to read the book, and maybe I will soon. I love the first shots of the saga's heroine, Lisbeth Salander, as she walks alone through pedestrian tunnels. This is where I become absorbed in the tone and style of the picture. And I'm not let down as her character arc continues. She is truly one of the most intriguing main characters I've seen in a movie in a very long time. She is a mystery, characterized by significant hang-ups in her interactions outside of those she knows or chooses to engage, along with unvarying yet strangely contrary patterns of behavior and interests. I love her chemistry with Blomqvist, the journalist-under-fire who seems to be our central protagonist, how their arc together flirts with formula, but ultimately defies it.<br/><br/>The performances are effective all around. But while all of the performances are powerful, including those of Michael Nyqvist as the admirably zen journalist, and Peter Haber as the implacable brother of the vanished girl in question, this movie and this character are endemic to Noomi Rapace, to the degree that casting anyone else as Lisbeth in a way almost sounds fool-headed. She commands a sophisticated and enticingly refractory performance in a story that shaves off coatings of society cues and behavioral expectations to reveal camouflaged penalties women suffer for their selfhood."
"DICK STEEL","9","4","8","3 August 2010"," A Nutshell Review: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","Based upon the novel by the late Stieg Larsson, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is one of those films that is crafted superbly enough for Hollywood to take notice and want to toss it on the remake gravy train. Daniel Craig has been attached to star, and you will understand why David Fincher has been appointed director of the upcoming Hollywood version, because the mystery in this film is something right up Fincher's alley, and I felt cutting close to his Zodiac at times as well. But why settle for a remake when you can now watch the original?<br/><br/>Niels Arden Oplev directed a sprawling introduction to the world of the titular computer hacker known as Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), as well as that of an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who's waiting to serve time for his supposedly libelous Millennium magazine article on an influential industrialist. We follow separate narrative threads that introduce both main characters and the challenges they face in their lives, one with a jail term looming, while the other having to surrender to the whims and fancies of her parole officer who's out to look for sexual favours in exchange for lenient reports.<br/><br/>But of course our spunky Lisbeth is more than that damsel in distress. Noomi Rapace gives her plenty of attitude as she takes charge of situations, never cowing away from fisticuffs should the need arise, and possesses enough mean streak in her by way of a grunge punk rock look to wonder why such inner high walls built to shield herself from the injustices that she had suffered. Michael Nygvist's Mikael also isn't our typical alpha-male, and is more the down to earth type of hero who relies on his wit, written word and networking abilities to see him through a paid assignment by a tycoon to track down his missing niece.<br/><br/>The narrative takes some time to warm up, and when it finally does, everything careens at full speed, with the investigators coming together to pool resources and smarts in solving a 40 year old mystery. The two and a half hours seemed to be compressed, with Oplev demonstrating a measured yet intense grip on how the proceedings of the story will unfold, with bit by bit revelations becoming the hook to draw you into the mystery. In some ways, the story may resemble in part to that of Murder of the Inugami Clan, where an extended family comes filled with relatively bizarre characters each hiding little secrets that threaten to explode, and each contributing a step closer to the truth.<br/><br/>While Oplev designs a mystery thriller, there are some tools of the trade used in horror films that get employed to great effect here as well, especially the build up of anticipation where the dynamic duo begin to get close to fishing out results, with nicely done interplay between light and shadow, and jump cuts even that worked to keep you at the edge of your seat. You'll find yourself inevitably attracted to the plight of the characters and will invest enough emotions that will root for, and desire that they emerge unscathed from an investigations that seem to scream Trouble and Danger.<br/><br/>There are the follow up Swedish films in Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, inclusive of this installment already released so far outside of Singapore, and hopefully we'll get to see the other two hit our shores soon enough. This one's left uncut, so all the nudity and graphic, gruesome stills were intact, in which the latter can be a little bit unsettling. But don't let that put you off from an engaging mystery, and finally you can watch something the world out there has been raving about! Recommended!"
"david-phillips-4","8","4","8","18 March 2010"," Excellent detective yarn
","With Stieg Larsson's books flying off the shelves and director's such as David Fincher rumoured to be interested in directing the Hollywood version, the first film version, made and set in the book's locale of Sweden is an excellent movie. I have not read the book, so in this case I could only view the movie as just that, a movie. My instinctive was that the movie was formulaic. That is to say that it followed a very well worn and familiar path that detective stories follow (stories because this can also encompass detective literature). That's not to denigrate the movie at all; the film is an absorbing detective story that has enough about it to engross you for the full 2 and a half hours. Which is where, I think, we do start to notice differences between detective stories. Detective stories have a lot of exposition to get through as more often than not, the information gathered about all of the protagonists helps lead to the culprit. The key to that in film is to handle the exposition in such a way that the audience does not realise that they are purely being fed information. Varying the locations and the characters that provide the exposition helps enormously; particularly if you have a strange character in a strange location providing the details. In TGWTDT, the characters do have depth and the locations are generally good, but this gimmick is not relied on too heavily. Nor is the tried and tested ""if you think the pace is flagging, have someone burst through the door with a gun"" used at all. Instead, I felt that the film held my attention by appealing to the puzzle solver in me. The detectives, in this case a disgraced journalist and a professional hacker, are meticulous and methodical in their approach. They uncover clues and patterns throughout their investigation, all of which got me thinking along the same lines and, occasionally, coming to the same conclusions at the same time. So another key area for success with a detective story is to keep the audience engaged, but not to let them get further ahead with their own investigations until it is time to crank up the tension because we now know what is about to befall our heroes. TGWTDT provides all of these. It is low on action, but when action is called for it delivers with short sudden bursts that jolt the viewer. It also carries with it a level of brutality that provides shocks in place of action sequences. If you want something that doesn't jolt you out of your comfort zone (watching a detective unravel the mystery without engaging your own brain), then avoid this. If you want an engaging and involving detective story experience then go see this movie. I have intentionally avoided referencing the story, as I think this movie is probably best viewed with no preconceptions. Having said that, my girlfriend had read the book and felt that the film, although abbreviated the book, did include most of what was required and was still thoroughly enjoyable. www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com"

Each characters was like a cut-out from an old Agatha Christie novel - except instead of false clues to keep you guessing this one adds in rape, torture and Nazis.<br/><br/>Looking back I would say that the movie depended too much on the two main characters - neither of which were played well enough.<br/><br/>I read in other reviews that the book is better than the movie.

","Wow! If you only think that, mainly, what we do know about Scandinavian cinema regards Ingmar & Ingrid Bergman, Max Von Sydow or Liv Ullman... How sad can it be for a really good movie like this to not have an international promotion! Sorry, I cannot recall the actors' names (sorry again!) but I think it's one of the best thrillers I've seen lately. Precisely (director) driven, beautifully played, great score, very interesting screenplay (and, I have no doubt, a great novel as its source...) all comes to almost 2,5 h of really ""who dunnit"" master work. I just saw it 20' ago, so I might be still excited by it, but I cannot make any comparison to any other Hollywood high/medium budget nice stories, with super-stars trying to be good detectives or profilers and failing to it. The first thing that comes to my mind is ""Se7en"", a movie that kept me to the edge of my seat. I felt almost the same now... Finally: all my respect to these high-class actors (the old Vagner, Martin Vagner himself, as supporting actors) but all my esteem for the roles of Mikael & Lisbeth. I hope to hear more from them. Don't miss it!"

Lisbeth is a very interesting and intelligent girl, which I think you don't quite get in the movie.<br/><br/>In some scenes the acting of Noomi Rapace is brilliant, as well as Peter Andersson, and the chemistry between them is really uncomfortable.<br/><br/>But I must recommend the film, and I'm eager to see the 2 following movies based on the books 2 and 3 (if they will be made)."
"vikpk","2","15","46","4 October 2009"," Went way too long, too pretentious
","Slow paced film, a wanna-be hybrid of Euro and American cinematography. The acting is believable to a certain extent and the motivation of the characters seems to be supported by the plot and their character development, with some exceptions. The female character is unlikely to be so savvy at her research abilities at such a young age. The build up of the ""guardian"" of the female character is flat and merely designed for the audience to hate him so that all feel relieved when ""he gets what he deserves."" No sense of relief for the viewer at that scene though, only disgust at the lowly and despicable scene of violence. The female is disproportionately and unbelievably powerful in solving the problems of the main protagonist - both intellectually and physically. Along those lines the movie follows the Hollywood trend of the last years ""females rule"" - smart, independent women in their early 20s, who fix the mishaps of sturdy, well framed, but somewhat stupid men, and who leave to the lady to get what she wants. The only difference is that the woman in the Swedish flick is not a PhD, but a rebel with a tattoo the size of her body. The plot does develop in a logical sequence and has some twist and turns. However, they come way too slow to keep you interested and on the edge of your seat. The story telling is OK with the exception of when the story moves to other, far-off locations. There is no transition or any scenes to show that the protagonist goes to a foreign country, for example. Unless you're a fanatical fan of the Euro ""cinema"" -- not worthy the long two and a half hours."

","This version being the original is perfection, the US version makes me weak to my stomach. We have a lot of upsetting personal feelings about Hollywood taking this version being a beautiful work of art, and destroying it's flair by making the cheaply crap based Hollywood version remake. I have written many articles on this specific version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and each time I go to see more on this movie online, I see that the US Hollywood Crap version seems to be the first in the searches. Yes this film has subtitles, but the acting, and story-line are of the highest quality. Hollywood cannot conceive the understanding of artistic values, or original creativity they only take from others and destroy the art in cheap remakes. Noomi Rapace is by far an incredible actress, I've watched almost every film she has been in. I also watched every film that starred Rooney Mara which is extremely un- impressive. Rooney Mara is the new Christina Ricci, and in acting abilities it is impossible for her to take the staring role of The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo even in a remake and make it anything realistic. We've written a huge discussion on this film and the rest of the series on our official website.

","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2009) (Swedish books and movies) I had not read the Swedish book(s). The Steig Larsson books are still best sellers. I watched the movies with my wife who helped me follow the complex plots. The Swedish actors, accents, personalities and interaction are typically European and gritty. Dubbed English and closed captions make the content understandable. The Dragon Tattoo books and movies are complex, violent thrillers. Stop here spoiler alert. These movies depict multiple murders, political intrigue and graphic sexual torture. The movies run 2 to 2 ½ hours but don't drag. Sexual activity is explicit but not erotic. The Swedish author Stieg Larsson began the books as a hobby and later learned their market value. Larsson was a workaholic, ate junk food, was a heavy smoker and died prematurely of a heart attack. The foreign films are well worth watching. Noomi Rapace is excellent as Lizabeth, the tattooed girl. Journalist Michal Bloomkist works tirelessly to solve the crimes. A caring relationship between the two protagonists continues in the books and movies. I also enjoyed The Girl Who Played With Fire (2009) and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (2009)"

","The Millennium Trilogy has become a publishing sensation, selling millions of around the world and made its author Stieg Larsson a household name after his death. A film adaptation was always going to be in high demand and the Swedish version is to make a feature film of the first novel and TV adaptation of the other two novels and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is one of the most successful Swedish films to date.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is a journalist who has been sued for libel and sentenced to three months in prison. With his reputation in tatters a major industrialist, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) hires him to investigate an old mystery, the disappearance of 16-year-old great-niece Harriet (Julia Sporre). What makes the mystery even deeper is that it happened on an island that had no access to the mainland, no body was ever found and the Vanger family is distrustful, hateful bunch, so murder seems likes the only explanation. Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) is a skilled private investigator and a computer hacker and she has a very dark and troubled pass. A sadistic lawyer, Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson) has control over her finances and Lisbeth has to find a way to neutralise him. Both Blomkvist and Salander are brought together and investigate what happen to Harriet, finding that something much bigger has been going on.<br/><br/>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a great novel, a real page turner making the reader really wanting to find out what happens next. Niels Arden Oplev and his writing team really a really great job at adapting the novel. If you are a complete purist you will never be happy with film adaptation but The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo does not cut much out, only a few subplots and change a few elements to avoid the film being over loaded with characters. The only changes that really cause any problems are the offer to Blomkvist for him to take what is a seemingly thankless job, his relationship of his daughter and his distrust of religion and some elements involving the business of Millennium which becomes important later in the series. But these are fairly minor and the film does a good job at getting round these issues.<br/><br/>Oplev certainly made a stylist thriller and for a film that is 2 hours, 20 minutes long, he made sure that his adaptation was a tense, fast pace affair. Scenes of particular note are when Lisbeth are with Bjurman, where you could cut the tension with a knife because of the strong interplay by Rapace and Andersson and Oplev handling behind the camera. This is a dark moody film, filled with great acting throughout. The cast really fitted their roles being very much like their counterparts in the book. Anderson was particularly creepy as Bjurman and Rapace had a lot of fight in her as Lisbeth. Nyqvist made a really good Blomkvist and I want to see what The actors in the Hollywood version have a lot to live up to. Oplev made sure that his version is very hard hitting film but so is the book and Larrson did not hold back. Everything worked in this film, the music, the editing, the cinematography and art direction. It is a well made adaptation.<br/><br/>One criticism I have of the books is that I find some of Larrson's characterisation of some of his villains. In The Girl in the Dragon Tattoo it was very complex and believable about how sadists, rapists and serial killers are like, but later on Larrson goes for big conspiracy theories about big business and Security Services and most of the bad guys are hate women, blaming them for all their problems. There is also Larrson's politics, pretty much everyone good is centre-left, no one is even mildly conservative and Larrson has a real disrespect for the centre-right. I have same problem with Tom Clancy who idealises Ronald Regan and most the Republican party and vigilantes and anyone who is a Democrat or a peace activist or supports anything the Republicans disagrees with is a someone who wants to hold back or destroy America and the West: rant over!"

"mirwais-orbit","10","2","3","25 June 2011"," Surprised and breathless.
","I'm from Brazil and I never heard anything about this story, nor the Millennium trilogy or anything about it till one day I was caught reading some news about David Fincher's new movie which is entirely based on the original 2009's Swedish movie based on Stieg Larsson's novel 'Men Who Hate Women' (Män som hatar kvinnor, 2005). From that moment on I looked for more information about it, read everything I could find and the more I was informed about, the more I was curious about.<br/><br/>Finally I could have the possibility to get the entire original movie trilogy to watch before watching any American version that are set to be release, or even trailers. Today I've watched the first one and I'm breathless. It's one of the best investigation/crime movies I've seen. Its impressive, well constructed, edged plot is really intense. The characters are also edged, full of interesting psychological layers, completely out of what is usually created. The story is extremely well developed and all the parallel stories withing the main plot are tied amazingly, being easy to follow even with its complexity level. I mean, there are no unnecessary twists or red herrings that American movies usually have just to play with the audience, the main plot lead us to the subplots with no efforts because the effective screenplay and direction naturally hold our attention in a full-circle story, guiding us from a defined beginning thru a fully coherent and satisfying ending.<br/><br/>The acting level is another top thing. Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander are responsible for entire movie effectiveness, both are completely different from each other, but at the same time their chemistry is amazing and their relationship may be complex but understandable. At first impression Noomi Rapace's character may seems awkward and move with all of our inner prejudices, but then you're intensely touched by her past and story and her difficulties to adapt herself into a harsh world and that's when you finally realize once again that prejudice isn't the best judging tool for anything.<br/><br/>Every single scene in the movie has its reason to happen and that is impressive and refreshing for those ones that are tired and so used to American movies filled with empty scenes. It's a movie with some disturbing images, but as I said before, it's effective and necessary for the development of the characters and also for the deepness of the story.<br/><br/>Now I can understand David Fincher's reasons to make an American version of the trilogy, not because since Seven (1995) there wasn't so many interesting thriller movies, but because 'Män som hatar kvinnor' not only can be easily the best one since Seven but maybe better than Fincher's classic. But really, I can't understand the reasons for an American version when the original Swedish one is superb, with an extremely top notch production. So I hope Fincher doesn't overdo the elements that the original retained in the exact doses, but unfortunately we can expect an extremely cleaner version.<br/><br/>After watching the first part of the Millennium trilogy, I'm much more excited to watch the other two parts."

There's a great contrast made between the aristocratic mansion of Henrik Vanger, the modern home of Martin Vanger, and the ramshackle cottage used by Blomkvist.<br/><br/>The story is the excellent plot from the book, and this film gives full rein to it, including the explicit sexual violence, the painstaking detective work, and the unusual relationship between Blomkvist and Salander.<br/><br/>It's a really good movie."
"fuelrod","7","37","143","2 March 2009"," Some must penetrate the HYPE!!!
","First - I have not read the book, so I'm not one of these hardcore but also biased Millinium fans.<br/><br/>2 1/2 hour is far to long for this movie. Especially when it takes almost 3/4 hour before the plot starts to roll, and the plot pushing mystery is solved 1/2 hour before the end credits - I and the others in the cinema did a lot clock checking during this show...<br/><br/>I don't have the exact numbers but I'll guess this is serial killer movie no. 427, and it's serial killer movie no. 423 where quotes from the Bible are a (or THE) major key in solving the riddle - To put it nice the murder plot was a perfect cliché and so predictable it almost became a joke.<br/><br/>The movie introduces a lot of characters but all except one are through the movie presented as shells and not persons we get to know and therefore understand. The exception is the Lisbeth character but the portrait of her insists on her being so mystique that she ends up being an impersonal caricature.<br/><br/>The conclusion is that the movie is a standard Scandinavian socio-thriller very suitable for a 1 1/2 hour TV-show in the style of Beck or Wallander. As a cinematic movie it's mediocre - to long, to full of clichés, character building to flat & impersonal and the plot to predicable."

","I had heard a lot of good things about this Swedish film adapting the best selling books in the ""Millennium Trilogy"", so I had to see what all the fuss was about. Basically in Stockholm it has been forty years since the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, most people, including her uncle Henrik (Sven-Bertil Taube), believe that she was murdered, even though her body was undiscovered. To find out the truth Henrik, with his lawyer Dirch Frode (Ingvar Hirdwall), hire journalist and Millennium magazine chief-editor Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), who was recently released from prison for slander, to investigate. Also hired for the same investigation is ruthless computer hacker, with the large tattoo of a dragon on her back, Lisbeth Salander (BAFTA nominated Noomi Rapace), who hacks into Mikael's files. Both have travelled to Hedeby Island near Hedestadt to follow leads to see what happened to Harriet on the last day she was sen, with the access to some revealing photographs, where she apparently is looking at her kidnapper. While Mikael examines these photographs, Lisbeth needs some favours, such as money, from controlling lawyer and her probationary guardian Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson). It is when Lisbeth refuses to give Nils sexual favours that he turns aggressive and sadistically rapes her, but she gets her revenge after revealing she secretly taped it, threatens to release it, and tattoos the words ""I am a sadistic pig and a rapist"" on his stomach. Eventually Mikael and Lisbeth cross paths, and realise they are both on the same assignment, so they join forces to continue the investigation, where revelations of other murders and dark family secrets crop up. Obviously this investigation is putting Mikael and Lisbeth in danger, so there are one or two chase sequences, and along the way it seems the couple are becoming very close indeed. After so much searching and determination, Lisbeth seems to go off somewhere, but Mikael finds Harriet (Ewa Fröling) living and well, after being afraid to go back, she was the one sending the suspicious flowers in frames, and her uncle is overjoyed when they reunite. In the end, Mikael returns to his working as a journalist, while he sees Lisbeth disguised in photos going off somewhere after hacking millions out of the account of Hans-Erik Wennerström (Stefan Sauk). Also starring Lena Endre as Erika Berger, Peter Haber as Martin Vanger, Marika Lagercrantz as Cecilia Vanger and Björn Granath as Gustav Morell. If you are lucky enough to have the English dubbed version, I think this film makes much more sense that way, Rapace is brilliant as the title character, and Nyqvist is reliable too. The director makes sure there are plenty of shock moments, the tension keeps building, and there are twists and turns to revel, it is an impressive crime thriller. It won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Very good!"

","What a refreshing escape from Hollywood movies! The heroin Noomi Rapace is highly believable, which makes her action scenes incredibly watchable. You just know that this woman is not too different from people you know or see around in Brighton. She is QAQV (quiet and quite violent). It's a real mystery story and it is that, you realize, that demands you focus on each scene. It is a very intense movie so go prepared to stay frozen for 90 minutes. The movie is being remade in Hollywood, but with another actress (from Nightmare on Elm Street) but the calm power of Noomi Rapace cannot be replaced and I would guess that the new version will be (as usual) a poor remake with the most powerful 'indy' scenes removed."

","With Hollywood as well as moviegoers apparently stuck on stupid like never before in 80 years -- the current ""Inception"" is Exhibit #1 and ""Shutter Island"" is #2 -- along comes this Swedish made drama for persons like us who prefer intelligence when we see a movie.

But what a brilliant and engrossing exercise in movie-making, turning an overworked genre into wonderful originality.

"amarv","9","4","9","14 April 2010"," one of the better crime mysteries that you will see
","The movie is rated R with nudity & some violence.<br/><br/>In ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" directed by Niels Arden Oplev, is adopted from the 1st book of the hugely popular ""Millennium Trilogy"" series written by Stieg Larsson. Spare a thought for Larsson because he died before any of the trilogy books were published. The movie is the biggest ever Scandinavian movie & the highest grossing movie of Europe in 2009. There are 2 more sequels to this film which have been already released in Sweden & will be released in U.S in the coming months. I didn't read the novel but as the movie is gradually unfolding, you can actually feel like reading the book. The literal translation of the Swedish title is Men who hate Women.<br/><br/>Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) is a retired former head of a business empire as well as the head of a big dynasty. 40 years ago his niece Harriet has disappeared & her body was never found. Henrik, for whom Harriet is like a daughter, is convinced that she is murdered by some one from his own family & he employs a tainted journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) to find the murderer. Mikael gets an unlikely partner in the form of the antisocial computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who is fighting some demons from her own past. They form an unlikely detective pair & together they must find the murderer before they themselves became the target.<br/><br/>For a movie to be a good crime thriller, in my opinion, you need good screenplay & editing along with great story & performances. DEcent music doesn't hurt either. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a perfect package of all the above.<br/><br/>The plot is not as simple as I've mentioned above. There are many layers to the story. Characters in the movie are not some simple caricatures but are filled with real meat & flesh. Michael Nyquist as the disgraced journalist has done a very good job. All the supporting cast are good.<br/><br/>But the performance of the movie goes to the girl with the dragon tattoo Noomi Rapace. Hers was the toughest job. She played the role of a young woman who has been abused since childhood by society & most of the people that she knows. So she develops a kind of apathy towards the society. Even when she finally finds a man whom she loves, her troubled past means she can't trust him. Also she is afraid to take the next step & can't express her love. Lisbeth Salander is one of the more complex characters that you will see this year. In an interview Rapace said that she knows Lisbeth in & out. It shows in her performance. After the movie I googled Noomi Rapace & I was astonished with the difference between the real Rapace & reel Lisbeth. If I give you the pictures of Rapace & Lisbeth, you would think they are completely different persons. A double thumbs-up for Rapace. Of late, I've heard that some idiots are remaking this. Whoever takes her role has a really huge shoes to fill in.<br/><br/>Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg have done a good job in adopting the screenplay to the big screen. Anne Østerud has done an exceptional job with the editing. With appropriate background score & good cinematography the movie was very well made.<br/><br/>Niels Arden Oplev has handled the 150 min movie very well without letting loose the grip anywhere. Of course the screenplay definitely helped him.<br/><br/>I was dangling whether to give this 8 or 9 but since I'm not witnessing the release of many good crime mysteries these days, I went with a 9. Without a doubt, this will be one of the best crime mysteries that you will see this year.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit http://amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/"
"Quinoa1984","8","4","9","9 April 2010"," (review of American cut): what a mystery movie should do nowadays- absorb us in and get us set for anything
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is concerned with its plot, but also, and maybe even more-so than in most American films, with the characters. It's as if the Swedish filmmaker behind the film, by way of the very popular book(s) by Stieg Larsson, doesn't want to compromise anything with the characters for the sake of the story. So the film becomes a balancing act between its themes and its characters, its plot and its persons going through trying to figure out what happened to Harriet Vanger forty years ago. I'm not saying they're the most fully rounded and developed beings in a mystery movie ever, but I'm glad to see that a filmmaker has the guts to put the characters up front for us, particularly the force on the screen in Lisbeth Salander played by Noomi Rapace.<br/><br/>It's her that we're given as the real lead of the story - by the end it feels as if the story, however neat and tidy it might seem (and, perhaps as a slight fault, be it through the cutting of the Swedish version or not, a little too tidy), continues with her and not journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and given perspective. While the story, about the search through the case file closed long ago for the disappearance of Harriet, is engrossing once it really gets going, it's also about women, and the violence done to them. We've seen a killer with this sort of sick method before, of the kind of 'true' evil and hatred that comes out of repression and racism and, yes, inbreeding. But not put into the context of a lead character who, throughout her life leading up to this case she stumbles upon, has had to put up with the worst in men. Really, really bad men.<br/><br/>Indeed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo carries with it a rather nasty undercurrent that may turn off viewers expecting just a mystery story. In its own right it's as hard to take as Silence of the Lambs was for audiences back in 1991, as we're brought in to what sort of frame of mind might do such a thing as kill an innocent girl (or, as we learn, more). But what it is, at the least, is just a plain well-told story. You know the kind, where we're given hero-characters (maybe more flawed here than usual, but still) put to task to find out just what happened. And like a really grisly and humanly ghastly murder mystery as the layers are peeled away it feels ickier, the images of those pictures, those slaughtered girls Harriet alluded to in her notes, appearing before us like ghosts.<br/><br/>If the director exceeds at creating just a bit of mood with his story (and, while a repititious method, the dissolves and super-impositions create a really strong palette visually to draw upon), he also cast his film with some strength. I'm sure just based on this film Rapace doesn't have to worry about a career for a while, and not just in Sweden. I could see her playing as a tough girl in a thriller here in the States, or, just as well, a more vulnerable character as Lisbeth is both (albeit I've yet to see her in anything else, this could work just fine as a calling card showing a multitude of range with the exception of, of course, comedy). Her character is like a cross between a femme fatale and a runaway from life, dangerous and hostile with layers built up to protect herself (and, sometimes, it has to come in handy with horrors like her really sick-f*** new probation officer). On the opposite side of her is a more subtle turn from Nyqvist, who has to be more restrained as he's the more 'normal' character, or with more on his plate (his character is after all being set-up in another case he worked on).<br/><br/>So, the ultimate effect of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that of solid storytelling matched with strong characters. We want to see the characters solve the mystery, as dark and depressing as it gets (and really as lurid as it does too, something David Fincher can work with perhaps in the American remake). While it's not really a 'perfect' thriller or mystery by any stretch - some plot holes, such as why the characters don't take the pictures touched by the intruder fingerprinted when they're so investigative about everything else, or why Lisbeth lets a character go in a crucial scene - it involved me more than I can think of from a mystery-killer movie in a while. I'm sure I'll want to revisit again, if only for that breakthrough performance from that actress, and for some of those impressive visual-story bits with the pictures (watch as they move!)"
"rich_alderson","8","4","9","16 March 2010"," Very competent adaptation of complicated novel
","Really enjoyed this film despite having read the book and therefore knowing the ending which I won't spoil here. Rapace will deservedly get most of the plaudits, but kudos also to some of the minor cast members who do a good job bringing their roles to life. Salander's sadistic guardian, Bjurman, is particularly well played as a thoroughly loathsome individual.<br/><br/>Plot is very well interpreted for the screen with some aspects left out for logical reasons. Kind of wanted more of the Wennerstrom stuff, but I guess they covered it pretty well without disrupting the main story. As I said, despite knowing the ending, I found it very absorbing and it was fun watching Salander and Blomkvist make sense of the few available clues.<br/><br/>Looking forward to The Girl who Played with Fire!"
"Bolesroor","10","3","6","27 February 2011"," Excellence
","""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a rich, suspenseful mystery that sucks you in from the opening seconds and does not let go for the next two and-a-half hours.<br/><br/>The problem with most mystery films is that there's no mystery at all: clichéd characters, uninspired acting, a paper-thin plot and a lack of genuine suspense. This film is the exact opposite.<br/><br/>First, the acting. Noomi Rapace is brilliant as Lisbeth Salander, a brutish hacker with a violent past, and Michael Nyqvist is perfect as Mikael Blomkvist, a magazine reporter who's been framed by a dirty industrialist. Neither of the two leads ever hit a false note... they're not just characters, they're real people with elaborate back-stories and wonderfully complex personalities.<br/><br/>The case of Harriet's disappearance is so challenging that the film never dwells on Lisbeth and Mikael's emotions; the satisfaction comes from watching them try to deal with their personal issues while they chip away at a mystery so deep it almost consumes them. Every time they solve a piece of the puzzle they find five more pieces, and the story behind the Vanger family tree is so layered- and twisted- that there's almost not enough time to cover it all in one movie.<br/><br/>Every minute of the film is thrilling: it's directed with a focused urgency, an immediacy that keeps the tension high but never feels manipulative... the two and-a-half-hours feel more like forty-five breathless minutes. The result is a magnetic watchability- ""Godfather""-like- that is almost hypnotic, the stuff of great cinema.<br/><br/>I'm very difficult to please when it comes to movies, but this was one of the most substantial, exciting films I've seen in years. Acting, story, suspense... ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a triple-crown winner, and an excellent movie not to be missed.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

","This is a great film and deserves to be rated higher. I am very fussy about films but was captivated by the whole trilogy - if you like the first film then it is well worth watching the next two as well. The acting is subtle and not overplayed, and there's no dramatic music and cheesiness that you get in your usual dose of US blockbuster - it is a genuine thriller and great to have such a strong and multilayered female character. The very last scene at the end of the third film (""the girl who kicked the hornets nest"") sums up the whole three films. Why oh why are they doing a remake with Daniel Craig, what a mistake, the original is excellent and perfectly fine to watch with subtitles."
"Meven_Stoffat","10","3","6","9 November 2010"," One of those rare movie experiences...
","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is, all at once, a taut and suspenseful action thriller, and an interesting study of human nature.<br/><br/>A writer for Sweden's number one magazine, Mikael Blomkvist of Millennium, is facing a hefty fee of 150,000 kronor and a sentence to time in jail for slander and libel. Before his jail time is to happen, he gets a letter from Henrik Vanger, the head of a wealthy family. A man of 80, his niece had disappeared 40 years ago and was never found. He writes to Mikael asking him to help solve her mystery, and in turn, will help him out with the pickle he's in. So he moves to Hedestad, an island 3 hours away from Stockholm to get started on his work.<br/><br/>A tattooed and pierced computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander has been following Mikael's case for quite some time. Lisbeth has Aspergers (or some sort of autism). She's sexy, but she's troubled- she's had a troubled childhood being in and out of behavioural centres. However, fate, or so it seems, leads Mikael to Lisbeth, where they both work together to solve this amazing case.<br/><br/>This very film is why we go to the movies. At 152 minutes, your interest is held. It is a long movie, but the length is the last thing on your mind when watching it. Dragon Tattoo manages to keep you entertained, it immerses you in these awesome characters. They become your friends for 2 and a half hours, and the whole time you feel like you're solving the mystery with them.<br/><br/>This film is full of suspense, and for its entire duration I was on the edge of my seat. Michael Nyqvist is just GREAT as Mikael, and everyone else is great, but the real highlight is Noomi Rapace. She is one of the most gorgeous and talented actresses out there right now. It struck me how so different she is in real life too- in this movie, she just IS Lisbeth. She is more than just a pretty face, she is an amazing actress, and it's such a shame that there aren't many actresses like her nowadays.<br/><br/>In short, do not miss this flick. Even if you don't like foreign movies, do see this film. It is one of the greatest movies I've had the good fortune to see at the cinema, and a film that just improves with repeat viewings."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","6","14 October 2010"," Very impressive Swedish rendition of The Millennium Trilogy
","The ""Millennium Trilogy"" crime thriller from late Swedish novelist Stieg Larsson has stirred up considerable excitement in the global cinematic scene. While David Fincher's upcoming remakes undoubtedly creates expectation in the mass Hollywood fan, connoisseurs of the international cinema likely prefer the original Swedish rendition, even if they are not Bergman loyalists. Critics seem unanimously impressed with Noomi Rapace, some to the extent to comparing her casting to the titular role to similar discoveries such as Franka Potente in ""Run Lola run"".<br/><br/>The establishing scenes of this movie seem unusually long but make sense in relation to the two-and-a-half hour movie, which is in turn the first one of a trilogy, shooting of which has all been completed in 2009. In the first hour, we see in parallel the two protagonists. Lisbeth Salander is a 24-year-old computer wiz-hacker with a traumatic childhood. Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), barely old enough to be her father, is a divorced investigative journalist on a collision course with a powerful family of right-wing extremist which gets him into a libel suit and a prison term. He has six months of freedom before serving and is hired by an elderly billionaire to investigate the mysterious death (body not found) of a beloved niece forty years ago.<br/><br/>The story really starts, an hour into the movie, when the two protagonist meet and become partners in the investigation. The plot itself (gruesome serial sex murders with Biblical overtone), while serviceable, is not exceptionally impressive, particularly to seasoned murder mystery fans. The main attraction of this movie, most agree, is in the characters.<br/><br/>Blomkvist is a mild-mannered, unspectacular hero that does not impress the audience by first sight but wins them over gradually with his gentle, unassuming, dependable persona. This makes for good complementing compatibility with Salander, tom-boyish looking, hard as a nail, and generally described as ""damaged"". Their relationship starts out quite professionally. Quite interesting is that she knows all about him (she has been ""hacking"" him) while he knows nothing about her, and seems content with this disparity. When on one occasion she seeks him out rather unexpectedly at night (they are staying together in a small bungalow close to the crime scene to facilitate investigation) as a provider of an orgasm, it can almost be described as business-like. This denotes trust more than passion and, in view of her traumatic past, is quite significant. As well, from behind her tough and icy appearance, there are fleeting moments, especially when she is concentrating on her work, of childlike innocence that betrays a trace of vulnerability.<br/><br/>The mood of this movie is by necessity somewhat gloomy but never suffocating. Shots of the beauty of Nordic natures are breathtaking. There is no lacking of sexual violence but these are necessary part of the story and not manipulative. But in the end, it is because of the characters that the audience would not want to miss the two sequels."

","This film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's critically acclaimed novel brings together all the attributes of a classic murder mystery that is vibrant, intense and consistently intriguing.<br/><br/>The Swedish film, directed by Niels Arden Oplev, opens with a sentimental scene and shortly followed by the journalist's alleged law breaking.<br/><br/>Michael Nyqvist plays Mikael Blomkvist who is shortly asked to solve a mystery that has plagued Henrik Vanger for years, the disappearance of a family member over 40 years ago.<br/><br/>Keeping close tabs on Mikael's activity is 24 years old Lisbeth, a quiet yet clever individual who gets mistreated by her guardian and who soon gets wrapped up in Mikael's investigation and soon the clues are flowing and the film gets better and better.<br/><br/>The initial slow moving scenes help engage us into the worlds of each character and with such close detailed segments, such as Mikael's family life and Lisbeth's job and guardian changes we are immersed into worlds of deceit and corruption.<br/><br/>The plot boasts heavy life issues. There is a strong focus upon sexual hurt, the rape scene at the beginning is squeamish to watch and one of the eventual conclusions is equally horrible. All necessary and credit to Oplev who doesn't shy away from the pain and anguish of the film's most poignant moments. The high certificate's for this film are down to these moments of sexual indiscretion and violent themes and all fit necessarily into the film's plot.<br/><br/>The mystery of the missing girl pans out very well. Somehow the director is able to lay traps for you to interpret who is who and who may be a killer and what happened all those years ago and for that factor this has to be the best mystery film I have watched in sometime.<br/><br/>There are many factors elsewhere to enjoy. I personally loved the fact that this film had many features that in a Hollywood film would be corny but were handled with respect and a unique nature, such as the flashback scenes and the more intimate moments, all perfectly balanced and with blissfully no music to coincide with each moment.<br/><br/>Its hard to compare to other films but there is a feeling of a Scorsese with an excitement of a Hitchcock here, though its quite subtle and that makes this special. It isn't a copy, it isn't a wannabe Hollywood it is raw, real and ravishing.<br/><br/>Last year I tried to start the novel but unfortunately did not follow it through. Having watched this film and loved it I shall definitely pursue the sequel, the girl who played with fire, which has recently been adapted into a film. Given everything that took place in this film I got the impression that the books would all be powerful, exciting and intense and should anyone ask, I would suggest read the books then enjoy the film."

","Swedish puzzler/thriller about a damaged young women, Lisbeth Salander(Noomi Rapace), whose skills as a hacker(including her technical know-how in regards to surveillance)are well utilized by a specific corporation, helps a soon-to-be-imprisoned news reporter, Mikael Biomkvist(Michael Nyqvist, in an excellent, understated performance)as they attempt to find out what happened to a wealthy man's niece, Harriet. Henrik Vanger(Sven-Bertil Taube)is a very old man who yearns to discover what happened to his beloved Harriet, who vanished some 40 years ago, still receiving pictures of flowers from who he believes to be her killer. As the two join forces after a unique set of circumstances unifies them(paid by a Vanger personally to dig up any information pertaining to Blmkvist, she finds nothing criminal, which motivates Henrik to hire him; her continual hacking into Mikael's hard drive, she provides info which assists in moving the case forward), the search for Harriet may actually uncover a serial killer who was using bible verses as a means to symbolize the horrific crimes. Could Harriet have been a victim of this killer as well? Also, Blomkvist finds that several of the Vangers were Nazi loyalists. This is one of those thrillers which carries two down a dark road which yields unpleasant truths about a powerful family, the ole ""skeletons in the closet"" are revealed. The scene where Blomkvist is bound and seemingly at the mercy of the remorseless psychopath is chilling to the bones.<br/><br/>A word of warning: there's a guardian assigned to Lisbeth who is a perverse deviant who wants sexual favors(which soon includes rough sex and anal abuse)in return for granting her money that she normally handled herself. He blackmails her by threatening to send her back to a psychological ward if she doesn't ""behave"" and adhere to his desires. This includes a terrible rape which may be hard to watch, but there's payback for this sumbitch's evil deeds..Lisbeth gets his ass big time(emphasis on ass). Interesting development, the much older Blomkvist is startled when Lisbeth wakes him up in the middle of the night to have sex with him(could be a little creepy for some folks, but I found it rather surprisingly erotic). Important storyline involving a flashback to Lisbeth's past could explain part of why she's so distant, such a loner who has a hard time attaining emotional bonds..it also deals with why Lisbeth needs a guardian in the first place.<br/><br/>What I found absorbing was the use of photographs as a way to unlock the great mystery, and I think the investigative side of the movie(following the leads one step at a time, dead ends are removed, Lisbeth a major contributor to the answers which come to fruition)can be gripping if you let yourself be taken in.<br/><br/>A story thread that is almost forgotten once the central plot takes over involves Mikel's future prison time due to his being set up by faulty sources in regards to a corrupt businessman he was trying to expose(this businessman's fate is a humdinger)."
"christian-326","6","3","6","8 August 2010"," Part of the plots were pointless but overall good movie
","Overall: I think the movie suffered a little in terms of the plot. Maybe its the director's intention to stay canon to the book but I personally felt that really messed up the entire storyline for me. The movie however is a great thriller with an extremely well thought out murder case.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Extremely well thought out storyline in terms of the murder case. I like how it drew with realities such as Nazism and male supremacy. The numerical references in the story really keep people guessing what's behind all this.<br/><br/>The bad: Parts of the movie such as Lisbeth's sexual abuse by her parole officer could have been left out as they had nothing to do with the main plot what so ever. These I felt were distractions to the main plot (i.e the investigation of Harriet Vanger's murder) <br/><br/>Another plot line I felt was pointless was Mikael Blomkvist's charges. Its very anti-climatic that you begin a plot line that does not have anything to do with the main storyline. I thought this was a becoming an investigation into Wennerström's life.(I have to admit that I never heard of Stieg Larsson before and I have not read any of his books)<br/><br/>The ending of the film felt draggy because once the ""murder"" of Harriet Vanger was resolved there was little plot to develop anymore. The director could have summed up the movie there but vague and useless plot lines such as Lisbeth stealing from a bank were generated. That really made me feel like the director was trying to make this a longer movie."
"cadillac20","8","3","6","7 July 2010"," A very solid and suspenseful mystery
","2010 has been a year full of misses at the cinema. I haven't seen too many films I would call memorable, and even fewer I would say have made my list of top films of the year. But allow me to add one to that list. Though it isn't a perfect film, this Swedish cinematic treat is great in its old fashioned ways and creates one of the coolest and most memorable characters of the year.<br/><br/>The film is a murder mystery that starts in two different lives. We meet Mikel Blomkvist, a reporter who has just lost a court battle against a major company in an attempt to expose its corrupt CEO. We also meet Lisbeth, a punk-looking hacker who works as a researcher for a security firm and appears to be in some kind of legal trouble. After the initial court battle, Mikel is invited to an island by a powerful and wealthy retiree to help put to rest a 40-year old murder mystery. Along the way, Lisbeth and Mikel's lives become intertwined and together they attempt to finally solve the mystery.<br/><br/>The film plays mostly as an old fashioned murder mystery, with Mikel sifting through clues and Lisbeth using her computer skills to scour for information. Both main characters are played very well, with Mikel being the very intrepid and determined reporter. He's quiet and somewhat reserved, but has a good head about his shoulders and is quite smart. While he is good, he is a bit ordinary and doesn't particularly stand out. This works in that he is relatable, but this also causes him to be overshadowed by the best character in the film, Lisbeth.<br/><br/>From the first time we meet her, we are introduced to a character who is unusual but also very cool. She is unlike anyone else in the film and has a very good depth of emotion. Her appearance not with standing, this is a woman who doesn't take crap from anyone. Cross her, and you will find yourself in a world of hurt. This is evidenced twice early on, first when she is attacked at a subway by a group of young men and second when she seeks revenge on a superior (probably one of the more painful scenes in the movie). She certainly gets the most painful and powerful scenes of the film and shows many layers that make her one of the most interesting characters I have seen all year.<br/><br/>The mystery itself is quite good. It's very involving and thankfully, very old fashioned. There isn't a whole lot of action here, but the movie presents enough of a mix of character development and suspense that you're never really bored with anything happening. Just when it seems like the film might slow down, it gets back apace with more of the mystery. There's also no wasted camera work here. You might half expect to find lingering shots or useless cinematography, but there's none of that here. <br/><br/>I guess the least that can be said is that the film is wholly entertaining. The characters are never boring and the story is quite good with some very pleasant twists. It's not perfect. In particular, one sex scene seems a little out of place and Mikel and Lisbeth's relationship seemed a little forced, but these are minor complaints. I got over them quickly. This is a very entertaining film that I am proud to call one of my favorites for 2010."
"anneonymousone","9","3","6","28 June 2010"," Blast! Now I'll have to read the books!
","THIS ***WILL*** CONTAIN SPOILERS.<br/><br/>I saw this movie because I thought I would never read the books and because it received excellent reviews. Now I'm going to have to read the series. (No reluctant reader here; I'm complaining only because I have a huge summer reading list, and I prefer to read books before or instead of seeing the movies.) <br/><br/>It was only after the movie that I saw the translated title _Men Who Hate Women_. That surprised me, because towards the end, I kept thinking that the movie addresses what happens when good men (Mikael Blomkvist, Henrik Vanger) genuinely value women and are willing to take us---and the pain that has been inflicted on so many of us---seriously. Their job is not to redeem men as a group, as all men do not require redemption, but to remind us that not all men buy into the role of abuser, and that some take a stand against it. There are a variety of kinds of allies. But now I have to read the books to find out if Henrik Vanger ever took a public or private stand against his brothers' Nazi involvement.<br/><br/>At least one previous reviewer decried the graphic nature of the violence. The two scenes in which Lisbeth Salander is abused were difficult to sit through, partly because I am a survivor of violence against women, and partly because I kept wondering why the camera lingered on the details of such horror. When she attacks her attacker, it became clear to me that the camera is reporting, not exploiting. There was no joy for me in what some may see as revenge, and none for her, either. It is only through the use of his ""language"" of physical domination and the threat of financial abuse that Lisbeth can get free of him and, perhaps, make it clear to unbelievers that rape is more than the legalistic definition of sex without consent; rape is degrading, profoundly dehumanizing, and not sexy in the least.<br/><br/>It struck me as thought-provoking violence, rather than gratuitous. It also made me consider the worth of retribution. (I saw the American edit, which means, if these other reviews are to be trusted, that I do not know how Lisbeth was tattooed. That might add another layer of understanding the scarification she performs as a reminder to the man of what he has done, as a warning to anyone who might voluntarily sleep with him, and as a consolation to anyone else he may abuse that this man has abused others, and one fought back.) <br/><br/>My brain just now reeled at the realization that the scene in the cellar near the end (when Mikael Blomkvist was looking at the dates and pictures of the women who had been murdered) is a mirror to the scene where the carpenter's (?) widow shows Mikael the honeymoon photos. <br/><br/>I loved that there were few actors who might be thought of as ""Hollywood hot."" Granted, they are all of similar BMIs, but the camera lingers over real faces: those that are hiding, those that are pockmarked, those that have wrinkles. It is those faces that are perceived to be imperfect that are the most lovely. It is a character's intention and a viewer's attention that create genuine beauty. The trope of Lisbeth's hair as both armor and vulnerability got a little old for me.<br/><br/>Many reviewers here commented positively on the music. There were many times that it was too formulaic, and one scene where I thought Angelo Badalamenti needed to be listed in the credits and receive residuals for the movie's borrowing of pieces of ""Laura Palmer's Theme."" <br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding. Many Americans will not see movies with subtitles (which is why I had so much room at the theater) and will not stand for silences, thinking them wasted time. These silences are necessary at times for viewers to process the information they have received, to make predictions, and to think about the experience of watching the movie itself. As a Bollywood fan, I was not aware of the length of the movie at all, and was surprised to read about the run time(s) in the comments.<br/><br/>A previous commenter was concerned with the movie's end portraying Lisbeth as using the money she stole from a thief as a tool to become like the abusers, and I had the same problem as I watched. This situation may be addressed differently over the course of the novels and/or movies, but without a different resolution, her abuse of her law guardian becomes a mere imitation, not a move towards justice. And the domestic terrorists will have won.<br/><br/>It is my hope that this movie does not follow me into my dreams."

","When journalist Mikael Blomquist is sued by a financier,due to allegations of corruption (and is looking at possible jail time),he is temporarily given a ""holiday break"" from the magazine he is working for. Mikael is hired by the aged patriarch of the highly dysfunctional millionaire family,the Vangers. Mikael is given free reign to find out just what happened to Harriet Vanger,who vanished from the family at the age of 16. Mikael finds out just how screwed up the Vanger clan really is,and is drawn into a web of corruption,political graft,potential murder,sexual perversion,and other elements he probably should have just taken a pass and just taken time off,instead. Also figuring into all of this is a mysterious young woman known as Lisbeth Salendar,a woman who has been the whipping girl for far too long (she has a short fuse,an attitude problem,and other dark issues as well). Somehow,these two bond to try & sort out all of this insanity. Denmark's Niels Arden Oplev directs from a screenplay written by Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg,from the celebrated novel by the late Swedish author,Stieg Larsson. This is the first chapter in a trilogy of films based on Larsson's novels,which has already been filmed,and has been released throughout Europe. I eagerly await the next two films. Spoken in Swedish with English subtitles. Not rated by the MPAA,this film contains pervasive strong language,strong sexual content,nudity & some graphic,bloody violence that will disturb some (and this is from the same country that originally banned Star Wars in 1977,because it was considered too violent for it's time)"

However, it is just that: an okay film <br/><br/>It has some excellent things going for it - the cinematography, some of the acting. But the eponymous girl with the tattoo is so over the top that it all verges on cartoon somehow. <br/><br/>One of the things I most love about reading a book and watching a film or a TV programme, is the suspension of disbelief.

Also, there is a woman who the audience is expected to feel compassion for. This woman who knew more than anyone that said serial killer was always a complete fruit cake with sadistic tendencies. Did she send even an anonymous letter to the police to keep an eye on this bloke? In the same way she sent the flowers to her uncle?? Managed to do that anonymously didn't she? <br/><br/>Nup. She didn't. None of it adds up. .....and I say this from a veteran of English police drama's. <br/><br/>Realise I am in the minority here. If you love it, good on you.

","This Swedish who dunnit missing heiress/murder mystery/serial killer saga is a notch or two above the usual but nothing special. I guessed at the biblical connection immediately (Magda etc..) but was hoping against hope that this mass market cliché would not turn out to be true.<br/><br/>Once the biblical connection was forged this movie went from a 7 to a 5 and then when the Nazi and Jewish connections were added it went down to a 0. When will they bury that tired theme!?--now almost completely incredulous as the villains age into their late 80s or 90s.<br/><br/>I found the violent sex scenes rather middle class and tame...sodomy and oral sex is the best they could come up with? But the girl gets even with a dildo! So innocent and corny as to be laughable.<br/><br/>The cinematography was below average--nothing soothing fun exciting or unique in the visual department in fact the opposite.<br/><br/>The violence against women social message was overdone baggage especially the unbelievable subplot of the probation case manager.<br/><br/>The serial killer stuff is sort of grafted on as something historical and incidental to the main action... If I had known the movie contained these sub themes I would never have watched it--I like mysteries not horror movies.<br/><br/>I came apon this movie in a round about way. I had watched ""Headhunters"" a Norwegian movie which is 1000 times better than this film and when reading up about it I chanced apon this title in some way. Not in the same league at all.<br/><br/>It got an extra star for the Swedish provenance and the suspense part of the who dunnit--up to the bible clue that aspect was quite good and is successful in hooking you into watching the movie.

"paul2001sw-1","4","4","10","6 February 2011"," Nicely adapted, but dull
","There were some good things about Steig Larsson's bestselling thriller, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo': it was readable, there was a well constructed socio-political backdrop, and the core plot was an cleverly constructed variant of that old chestnut, the closed room mystery, with a solid detective story to eventually unpick it. There were also some things I disliked: the story was supposedly written to highlight male violence against women, but arguably revelled in such violence itself and then ""balanced"" this by equally grisly elements of revenge; the author's relentless plugging of Apple Macs was tedious and devoid of novelistic purpose; the central male character appeared to be a highly flattering portrait of the author's alter ego; while the central female character, Soljander, appeared to be pretty much whatever the author wanted her to be at each moment of the story, sexy and unsexy by turn, and a miraculously brilliant computer hacker to boot. Also, the taut central plot ultimately dissolved into something much more gruesome, but also less convincing. This (Swedish) film version (the first of two, the other made by Hollywood) gets some things right, most notably through its interpretations of the leading roles. Soljander here seems more coherent and thereby interesting, than she does in the book. But the book's greatest strength, its procedural detail, is harder to follow, and the director tends to rather spell out the meaning to compensate. The greatest failing, however, is shared with the book, and it's simply that the story is wildly over-complex, Larsson had a clutch of interesting ideas but maybe lacked the confidence to trust just one; either that, or he correctly judged the public appetite for wild, over-the-top tales. I've seen worse thrillers; but I have to say, I found this one dull."

We don't really know why Blomkvist agrees to investigates Harriet's death or why Salander takes interest.<br/><br/>In the book Salander rages like an insane person. This isn't really expressed in the movie. OK she fights back when some guys attack her in the subway but that doesn't really certify insane anger..<br/><br/>Why did martin run away after being hit on the shoulder with a golf club? Isn't he a sadistic cold blooded killer and THIS scared him off. wow Harriet could have saved herself a lot of trouble had she invested in some clubs. In the book Salander does more than strike him with a club. <br/><br/>Also I found it interesting how the bit about Martin taking sexual interest with Blomkvist was completely left out. <br/><br/>Mellinum is hardly incorporated, which is a major focal point of the book.<br/><br/>It was painfully long.<br/><br/>If you like this movie and now want to read the sequel ""the girl who played with fire"" well forget it, you won't understand much because the film really left out a lot of crucial info."

","When I saw all the great reviews and the trailers for this movie I was really expecting something a little more exciting.<br/><br/>This is a mystery movie about a girl who disappears sometime around WWII. Her uncle (old rich guy) hires a reporter to find out what happened to her. He suspects someone in the family offed her.<br/><br/>At the same time another story takes place that eventually merges with the main story. A girl (19? 20?) who had no parents and is taken care of by a guardian works for a company that does ""research"" for old rich guys or whoever else is willing to pay I guess. The old rich guy in this movie hires her company to check out the reporter to make sure he's on the up and up.<br/><br/>Her guardian dies and is replaced by a man who sexually abuses her. She manages to get back at him, and blackmails him into leaving her alone.<br/><br/>She discovers some facts regarding the girl who disappeared and sends them to the reporter. The reporter finds out who she is and recruits her to help him. Here is gets a little gross as the reporter looks to be in his late 30s or 40s, but they have an affair anyway. I think they just had to throw a little nudity in to keep people interested. IMHO they could have left out the entire sexual abuse thing and had a much better story (or at least just used a few short flashbacks so we could understand why the girl is so hardened).<br/><br/>Early in the picture the old man shows the reporter some pictures made of framed flowers and plants the missing girl used to give him as birthday presents. He shows the reporter an huge collection of these and claims whoever killed her is sending them to rub it in (since she was a favorite relative). At this point the end of the movie was completely ruined for me as I knew right away she must still be alive and sending him these gifts every year. This was such a amateurish mistake. I don't know if it came from the book or the movie, but it sucked.<br/><br/>There was some excitement in the movie as someone tries to kill the reporter, and eventually they find the bad guy, the girl kills him off (justifying all the scenes with the sexual abuse and some flash backs), finds the missing girl (who is an older woman now) and reunites her with the old man.<br/><br/>Too long, and some slow boring parts. I did not watch it with the subtitles so it may have been a little better in the original language. It reminded me of some boring Canadian movies from last decade, but not quite as boring.<br/><br/>I rewatch movies in my 600 strong collection quite often, and even though I bought the blu-ray version of this movie I doubt I will ever take it out, dust it off and watch it again. I liked the actors. The production values were adequate for a movie of this type, so I guess it was just not my cup of tea. Some reviewers seemed to think it was the best movie since they figured out how to pre-slice bread, but I don't see it myself. Each to his own I guess."

"FilmRap","8","3","7","27 August 2010"," The storyline will pull you in whether your read the book or not.
","This is the Swedish portrayal of the first of the three popular novels by Stieg Larsson. There is an American film of this novel due out in 2011. One of us read the trilogy and the other did not. When you have read the book , you are aware of all the subplots, relationships, twists and turns that are left out and of course you pretty much know how the mystery is solved. With a few exceptions, the movie followed the book fairly closely. The one of us who didn't read the book was pretty much able to keep track of the somewhat complicated plot and the various Vanger family members which could be a tad confusing. The male lead here is not a crusty or a brilliant detective but rather an investigative journalist by the name of Mikael Bolmkvist (Michael Nyqvist) who has just been convicted of libel with a pending jail sentence and has been asked to investigate the disappearance of a the niece of wealthy Henrik Vanger which occurred about 40 years before. The female lead is not the typical beautiful women you might expect to see in this situation but rather a very unusual 26 year old girl name Lispeth Sallander (Noomi Rapce), boyish, attractive, body piercings, dresses in black, rides a motorcycle. and has the huge dragon tattoo on her back. As a child she has had some type of psychiatric care and requires a guardian to manage her finances but is a brilliant computer hacker and has a photographic memory. There is violence, sex and nudity at times in combination but all in the service of the plot, not overdone, but enough to clearly deserve the R rating. The story will pull you in and the direction by Niels Arden Oplev captures the gamut from the beautiful outdoors in Sweden to the effects of painful violence. Despite it being almost 2 and half hours, the film does not drag at all. If you like this movie and are a fan of the late Stieg Larsson who didn't get a chance to see the great success of his work, there are two more Swedish movies in the can which complete his trilogy and then there is the American version of the first book which is coming out next year. I also heard that additional stories were found on the author's computer. The Netflix DVD which we viewed had an interview with Noomi Rapace who was quite impressive as she described how she approached her role and inhabited Lispeth for 1 1/2 years while the three films were being made."

","In true Bergmanesque fashion this languid Swedish gem of a movie starts slowly and gradually speeds up to walking pace. But let that not put you off. It's an understated little gem of a thriller that gradually unfolds with a complex and multi-layered story that is packed full of repressed sexual abuse messages.<br/><br/>At its core a political activist and writer (Michael Niqvist playing Michael Blomqvist) is hired by an industrialist to solve the 40 year old mystery around the disappearance of a slightly loopy teenage girl. Running simultaneously is the back story of a young super hacker (Lisbeth played by Noomi Rapace). Although a lesbian she gradually falls for, 30 years her senior, Blomqvist.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is subtle, even the fact that at no point in the movie is there any reference to its title, other than in one beautifully shot scene and even then it's almost incidental. The chemistry between Lisbeth and Blomqvist is so delicate you think it will shatter at any second, instead it grows millimetre by millimetre into a great double act. For that one has to applaud director Neils Adren Oplev whose work is unfamiliar to me.<br/><br/>It's to be released next year as a Hollywood remake with Daniel Craig replacing Blomqvist in the male lead role but bravely, the studio has stuck with the beguiling Rapace in the title role and =as it's to be directed by Michael Fincher we can expect good things because at the core lies a brilliant story that has been brilliantly written. (in fact in many ways this movie reminded me - albeit in a much lower key way - of Se7en.) It centres around abuse of all kinds, fundamentally sexual, but also racial and religious all wrapped together in a neat package that carries a strong moral and emotional punch and the good news is that the other two books in this series have also been filmed by the same team and are due for release BEFORE Hollywood enters the fray.<br/><br/>It's out on DVD now but please choose to watch it the way it was intended.

"robert-temple-1","9","3","7","13 August 2010"," The first of the Stieg Larsson films
","All of us who have read the three Stieg Larsson novels have eagerly awaited the cinematic versions of these riveting stories. The first novel was titled MEN WHO HATE WOMEN, but in English this was changed to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, due to the fact that the heroine Lisbeth Salander has such a tattoo. Larsson's main theme in his fiction, however, was the horrific abuse of women in Swedish society, which proves that it does not take a burka to reduce a woman to a humiliated state. It has recently emerged in press reports of a forthcoming book about Larsson by an old friend that the formative experience in Larsson's life was a traumatic incident in his teens where he witnessed the rape of a girl he knew by three of his friends, and was too much of a coward to intervene to stop them. He later asked the girl to forgive him, and she refused. He spent the rest of his life seared with guilt over this and his atonement was to write these horrifying exposés of the underbelly of life in modern Sweden. The three novels are known as 'the Millennium Trilogy', after the magazine Millennium of which the hero, Michael Blomkvist, is editor. Larsson himself was editor of a similar magazine, the name of which was Expo, because it did exposés, particularly of the ex-Nazis and Neo-Nazis of Sweden (who figure strongly in this film). Sweden is well known to have been a major 'ODESSA' destination for fleeing Nazis after the War and repository for much of the Nazi gold, and as a left-winger, Larsson campaigned against the Nazis and their sympathisers relentlessly. Many of these people were amongst the women-haters, rapists, torturers and imprisoners of women whom Larsson also wished to expose, as he does in this story. The Swedes have filmed all three novels, and all these films have already been shown there. The first of the series is now available on DVD with English subtitles, soon to be followed by the other two. The DVD of this film contains an important interview in English with the actress Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth (she pronounces her name Noomi to rhyme with 'gloomy'), as well as one with the producer. Both are very much worth watching. The casting of the two leads in the film is perfect. Rapace spent a year and a half 'as Lisbeth', making the three films, and apart from being too tall, is otherwise just about identical with the character in the book, to a truly astonishing degree. Michael Nyqvist is also perfect as Mikael Blomkvist. The Swedish films also have authenticity from having been made by Swedes in Sweden. Hollywood is currently doing remakes of all three films, but there is depressing news about that. They have chosen the infinitely boring and uninspiring (not to say highly irritating!) Daniel Craig to play Mikael Blomkvist. He is absolutely not right. Of the three novels, this one is the least interesting, because it is essentially the horrific saga of the dysfunctional Vanger Family, many of whom were Nazis. The most interesting of the three novels is the last one, which exposes the fantastic corruption of a rogue faction within the Swedish security services. That is the scariest of the books because of its wider implications. The intensely neurotic and introverted Lisbeth Salander is a remarkable literary character creation, a kind of autistic computer genius with a photographic memory who solves advanced mathematical equations in her head for fun. What we learn about her background and vicissitudes is such a horrifying revelation of some of the unpalatable aspects of Sweden that it puts you right off that country, and if it weren't for my faith in Selma Lagerlof, I might think the country should be shunned as a consequence. A great deal of material from the novel is necessarily omitted from the film, which contains very little about the character and story of Wennerstrom, for instance. One of the finest performances is by Peter Andersson, as the evil and sinister Nils Bjurman. He is so convincing, one wants to attack the screen. Sven-Bertil Taube is just right as the elderly Henrik Vanger. As regards the forthcoming Hollywood versions of these films, there are so far two sparks of hope: Erika Berger will be played in the Hollywood versions by Robin Wright (formerly Robin Wright Penn), and she is a very good choice indeed for that character, better in fact than the Swedish actress. And Stellan Skarsgard will play Martin Vanger, which he will do brilliantly. If he were younger, he would be the perfect Mikael Blomkvist, but he is 59, 17 years older than Craig, and so it wouldn't work. The casting of Lisbeth has not been announced, and we all must wait nervously for this casting decision. I suppose the little lost waifs Winona Ryder or Jennifer Jason Leigh would have been suitable when they were younger, especially the latter, as she was able to be tough as nails whilst at the same time being as fragile as a cobweb (never knew how she did that!). Let's hope producer Scott Rudin can think laterally and come up with some brilliant inspiration or even find an amazing unknown. He has a chance to 'go for gold', so let's hope he makes it. Of course, they could always cast Noomi Rapace, as she speaks English and knows more about Lisbeth than anybody alive. Why not? All three Swedish DVDs are already on sale with German subtitles, but only this one so far with English subtitles."

","It's so hard to find a decent suspense thriller nowadays, isn't it? I mean, most thrillers out there DO thrill, but once the film is over you realize all the movie did was spook you momentarily, and you don't even wanna start identifying and analyzing the various goofs, mistakes and unbelievably stupid twists it took for fear of ending up with pieces of a failure in your hands. Yeah, Hollywood tends to do that nowadays with the so-called thrillers that are spewed out by the week. Thank heavens there are still people around who know how to make a thriller that thrills AND manage to make it a heck of a film, complete with a practically flawless plot, characters to die for and an ending that begs for a sequel. One such film is Niels Arden Oplev's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", which I just finished watching and which I love beyond words. And, um, the film's Swedish, by the way...and just as a small side note, I think Swedish filmmakers should all teach Hollywood a lesson or two where thrillers are concerned: in 2008 the Swedish thriller ""Let the Right One In"" wowed audiences worldwide and now comes ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" with equally powerful results. Need I say more? Anyway, the film's about reporter Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) who's been accused of libel to one of Sweden's larger companies because he published an article in the Millennium journal which he couldn't prove afterwards. Before Mikael serves his short sentence in jail, he accepts a job offer from Henry Vanger, the leader of a highly wealthy family, to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger (Ewa Fröling) who mysteriously went missing 40 years ago and whom no reporter or private investigator has managed to track ever since. Henry suspects someone from his large, wealthy family killed Harriet and is bent on discovering the truth before he dies of old age. Henry believes Mikael is the right man for one last go at the search because of the Intel he's received on his private life, a dossier which a highly intelligent, highly pierced and tattooed computer hacker called Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) has managed to built up. Mikael and Lisbeth team up to solve the age-old mystery surrounding Harriet's disappearance and the disturbing family connections that they must uncover before finally reaching the truth.<br/><br/>Remember Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs""? A flawless thriller if I ever saw one. Remember what made the mystery and the suspense reach out to us? Flawless leading performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, that's what. We'll, we have the same exact case with this film. The story is very mysterious, the truths that are being unraveled on screen are nerve-racking, the suspense keeps you at the edge of your seat...but the lead characters, especially Noomi Rapace (whom I'm ready to hand over the Academy Award to) convinces us that it's not just another thriller à la John Grisham, but that there's actual HUMAN, believable characters there in the mix. Lisbeth is a goth, troubled young woman heaving a heavy past on her shoulders, and she turns up the attitude to the max playing out the fearless heroine of the story... but her down-to-earth performance, her multi-layered characterization, her pitch-perfect acting make her Lisbeth character jump out of the screen and touch us, win us over. We soon find ourselves actively rooting for Mikael and Lisbeth, actually CARING about what happens to them and believing every single thing that happens on screen...and all (or most of it) because of her wonderful performance. The film's focus is principally on Mikael, but whenever Lisbeth's on screen she steals the show hands down.<br/><br/>The story is extremely well done too. Based on the best-seller by Stieg Larsson, it's the first part of his Millennium trilogy (which he managed to complete before his death, may he rest in peace) and which chronicle Mikael and Lisbeth's adventures. While I was watching the film I kept thinking ""this is the modern version of The Godfather meets Sherlock Holmes"". The Vander family is everything the Corleone family might've been like in the 21st century; they're scary, evil, powerful and degenerate, and each member hides dark, gruesome secrets, and they're all being faced by Mikael and Lisbeth, common people like you and me but extremely intelligent and resourceful. Quite the cinematic mix, don't you think? I heard the sequel, ""The Girl who Played with Fire"" is already out in Sweden, and that gives me something to look forward to. They also tell me that the American remake of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is also underway, and that gives me something to fear. The U.S. just loves remaking the best films from around the world and they always end up destroying them; and I can't live with the idea of someone else destroying Lisbeth Salander. I heard they're thinking of casting Kristen Stewart in the American version; I recommend casting Noomi Rapace instead. Or better, just digitally insert Rapace's scenes into the American version and the film will have a good chance of being saved.<br/><br/>Look, the film's excellent. It shines with a special brilliance I seldom see in thrillers nowadays, be them American or foreign, and it's a movie experience I'm bound to remember. I highly recommend it. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!"

","A pretty good adaptation of the excellent first book of a trilogy by Stieg Larsson it is entitled - ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" This Swedish film confusingly renamed as ""Men Who Hate Women"" is currently being remade in English in Hollywood, god knows what they will do with it.<br/><br/>There are rumours of George Clooney being cast in the Michael Blomqvist role, hopefully they will cast someone young and good such as Ellen Paige as Lizbeth Salander. Her character is so strong that it will require an appropriately young and talented actress to pull it off.<br/><br/>The film differs slightly in plot from the book but only in areas where it progresses the plot and increases the pace of the film.<br/><br/>Essentially the story is the same and the dark gripping plot is a refreshing change from those more conventional thriller mysteries that usually have boring two dimensional ""who done it"" detective type characters.<br/><br/>I thoroughly recommend this film as a stand alone entertainment experience, it slots into the trilogy as a description of the meeting and early collaboration between the two main characters.<br/><br/>The story of the trilogy as a whole centres on the Lisbeth Salander character, the three interlinked stories are full of rounded interesting depth-full characters who interact in a believable and sometimes uplifting way, it also has dark grim stories within the plot and nasty villains who all press Lisbeth Salanders buttons, sparking vengeful reactions that are unexpected and equally intriguing.<br/><br/>I recommend not only this film but also the two sequels and all three novels which are all of course packed with additional details.<br/><br/>Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace are both excellent in their respective roles these films are unusual also in the respect that there are two leading heroic characters instead of just one.<br/><br/>If you like intelligent mystery thrillers you will really enjoy this."

The actress could never pass for 14 or 15 years old. The actor who play Mikael Blomquist was NOT attractive. In the book he had charisma and women fell for him left and right. <br/><br/>The story jumped all over the place and had I not read the book, I would have had no idea what was going on. So much was left out. The book is long enough they could have done what was done with The Hobbit and made it multi-part.<br/><br/>In short, a huge disappointment."

","Niels Arden Oplev coheres together an excellent re-telling of Stieg Larrson's first novel in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' collection.<br/><br/>The ambiance is certainly dark throughout however atmosphere is lighted with the occasional use of black humour. In all fairness, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is certainly a disturbingly atmospheric novel to place on the big screen and this makes the movie difficult to view in certain areas.<br/><br/>The narrative is fairly simple as a Swedish journalist (Michael Nyqvist) is on hand to help a desperate old man (Sven-Bertil Taube) re-ignite a search for his daughter, 40 years after her disappearance. As her personal life gets on top of her, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) stumbles across journalist Mikael and forms a partnership in a bid to assist him in his investigation. <br/><br/>The story maybe decent however is often rather bloated and isn't as engaging as it could perhaps be. Also, the film is rather worded; this isn't always a negative however it is considering it's duration stretches over two and a half hours.<br/><br/>The anchoring of the film is down to the chemistry between Nyquvist and Rapace. It ranges from various things such as their awkwardness at fist, their ability to work as a team and their differences in personalities which add a darkly comedic factor to a rather adult themed tale.<br/><br/>Another recommendable feature is the concluding half an hour which ties everything up sufficiently well and injects a essence of energy to the affair.<br/><br/>All in all, superb characterisation and on-screen chemistry from the leading cast members as well as a fitting conclusion make 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' a fabulous if gritty watch. Had it not been let down for its frequently slow pacing and familiar plot, it would have scored higher."
"frezeframe","10","2","4","15 August 2012"," *Sweedish version SUPERIOR to US version*
","My actual rating for this is about a 9, but I'm giving it a 10 because for some reason it only has a 7.8 on IMDb. Since IMDb is US dominated in usage, I can only guess it's because many IMDb Americans can't handle subtitled Swedish movies. <br/><br/>This original version of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of the most compelling and realistic suspense films in existence. It is uncensored, raw, and uncut. Make sure to watch the Netflix extended edition. <br/><br/>The Swedish cast, locations, culture and music all serve the story well. The acting is of the highest caliber you will find anywhere, and the action, sex and brutality move the tension and suspense forward in unexpected ways. <br/><br/>If I had to categorize GWTDT, I would say it's Sherlock Holmes meets Twin Peaks, with a serial killer Psycho kind of twist, and a pinch of Hacker. But it really stands on it's own. I've never seen anything quite like it. It's refreshing, smart, sadistic, seductive, charming, and thrilling all at the same time. It really plays with your emotions. You will see some very disturbing things, but are never left without a sense of justice. <br/><br/>There are a few things I didn't like, but the movie is so interesting and the characters are so compelling that you are completely engaged in this masterfully suspenseful and tense story.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is just the first part of the 3-part Millennium Trilogy. The next two parts (The girl who played with fire, and The girl who kicked the hornet's nest) are compromised, a bit forced and not as natural as the first, but they are still excellent- and still have the same strong character base that made it successful in the first place. <br/><br/>Check this out!"

It's so well done you just can't look away. The whole movie is so good that you don't dare look away. And you shouldn't look away. This flick is about as good as it gets. <br/><br/>Here's a hint, don't cross Lisbeth. She'll have your ass on a platter, probably barbecued. Her character is by far the most interesting and complex.

","First of all, I haven't read the books yet, so I'll definitely read them, now that I've enjoyed all 3 films. First of all, Michael Nyqvist, reminds me of Liam Neeson, very handsome actor and he excellently played his part of journalist, Mikael Blomqvist, with great strength and emotion, and of course, not to mention, the real main character, Lisbeth Salander, also very well played out by Noomi Rapace. Lisbeth is a computer hacker who manages to break into journalist Mikael Blomqvist's laptop computer. When she discovers that he's working on a mystery about a young girl's disappearance in the mid '60s, she helps him out by sending him clues. But when Mikael discovers that Lisbeth's been sending him clues, he figures out how to track her down by her emails, and pay her a visit. Eventually, the two decide to work together on the mystery. Together, in the first 2 films, their screen chemistry really mixes very well. The unfortunate flaw about their relationship is due to her unpleasant childhood, Lisbeth is fully unable to commit herself fully to Mikael. All three films have lots of twists and turns, even some surprises to make you jump out of your seat, or couch."
"rzajac","9","2","4","15 March 2011"," Smart thriller: Intelligent, truly thrilling, with a satisfying ending
","First, the ending: It's hard to end a movie. So many movies that start off like true labors of love somehow dwindle off into the sunset without a proper sense of finality; ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (TGwtDT) doesn't have this failing. That's very important.<br/><br/>Why do I like this flick? I think it's because the the filmmakers succeed in creating protagonists which are both larger-than-life *and* believable; a hard balancing act to pull off! You get drawn into their lives, and truly root for them. The admiration you feel for their exertions and stepwise successes is akin to how Watson felt when watching Holmes work. And yet another part of what you feel is hope and concern, which comes from the sense that they could be you. They're truly human-dimensioned, so the viewer is encouraged to settle in and identify with them.<br/><br/>At the end of all this drama comes the exposing of a great evil--and it's believably banal in character; a very effective move by the producers and director.<br/><br/>Speaking of which: Perhaps the most refreshing thing about TGwtDT is how it feels ""of a piece"", and not afflicted with the kinds of narrative and character development abandonment associated with mid-project cold feet on the parts of the producers. It really does appear that everyone knew what they wanted from the outset with TGwtDT, and they stuck with it to the end. And as a result the product never disappoints the good-faith expectations of intelligent viewers. They might have copped out and done a midproduction rewrite that simply posits and sews up the original issue: The 15-year-old girl's disappearance. But the filmmakers decide that actual moviegoers have enough brain cells to rub together to grok the Heisenbergian uncertainty that's thrown in to achieve a lifelike tone.<br/><br/>My one small remonstrance is that the voice-over work for the English dub felt about 95% there. There were occasional lapses in delivery that stuck out for me. One certainly hopes that the Swedish deliveries are 100% there! If you like mystery/thrillers, this is one you definitely have to check out."

","It seemed to go on forever but I wanted it to. I found the plot and mystery particular and new, and more than anything realistic in its story telling. I like the main female character for her silent thinking women scenes. I heard something on NPR that compared her to Bella from Twilight, and it is simply not true. Lisbeth is a new breed of female characters, she stands her ground silently and although is victimized she still has the will to fight back without feeling sorry for herself.<br/><br/>The actress does an excellent job in transforming into this cold character, but she still maintains the intrigue into the character.<br/><br/>Even with that in mind the characters are hard to connect to and even harder to completely understand, for these are not your typical heroes or heroins, rather they are just brilliant people who live in the situation of circumstances.<br/><br/>Overall this film is a good reflection on the popularity of the book series (something I brought and will be reading soon)."

The execution is solid the cinematography captures the beauty and mystery of the Scandinavian landscape and showcases each frame, the score contributes and sound effect is brilliant. The editing is mostly slick but there are a few times when the film moves slowly.<br/><br/>The film touches various issues from hacking to sexual abuse and discrimination against Jews post the Second World War.

Unfortunately he could not enjoy the remarkable success of his book publishing and now the sensation of the 3 outstanding films called: The Stieg Larsson Trilogy.<br/><br/>David Fincher is directing (2011) the American version of the first film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

The books are, forgive me, almost dull in parts. The author goes in to so much detail, so much backstory, so much minutae of Swedish political history, that they become hard to read. The meat of the stories is excellent, but it is hard to slog through some parts of the books.<br/><br/>The real story in the first book ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" doesn't really start until about a third of the way through.

The author uses way too many difficult Swedish street and place names that all but Swedes will not understand.

This movie ran for over two hours, so that most of the important events in the novel are all accounted for. There were some details which were altered for cinematic purposes, but that was also OK, since it fits right into the story without altering major plot points.<br/><br/>In the book, more pages were spent on journalist Mikael Blomkvist, the movie, on the other hand, gives practically equal, or even more, time to Lisbeth Salander, the pale thin Gothic female computer hacker with a disturbed past, facial piercings and the dragon tattoo, who helps Blomkvist solve the mystery of Harriet Vanger, who disappeared more than 20 years ago. Actress Noomi Rapace portrays the titular character Lisbeth bravely and with conviction.<br/><br/>I say I was also disappointed in a way that having read the book cannot make me a fair judge whether the movie was able to effectively build up the suspense into the revelation of what really happened. The movie, though not exactly how I imagined some things, is a very faithful retelling of the book's events, no surprises.

","The first cinematic instalment of the bestselling thriller 'Millennium' book series by Steig Larson is one that is certainly worth a watch if you haven't already. It focuses on computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (a star making performance by Noomi Rapace) and journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) whose paths cross when Salander is discovered spying on his work on his current case involving the 40-year old disappearance of a young girl. I think what elevates the whole film and indeed the story are the performances; every single person portrays their character no matter how small brilliantly and it engages you instantly from the start. The investigation is riveting and you genuinely care about whether they are going to solve the case or not. The backstories of the two central characters are also captivating and Lisbeth's past is shown quite cleverly in the film through nicely done flashbacks and slight nods to what could have happened, leaving much to the audiences imagination. The times it doesn't leave much to the audiences imagination are potentially what will leave viewers divided. There are two unsettling scenes in the first hour of the film depicting sexual violence very realistically; they are disgusting but also integral to the plot and build up to an extremely satisfying revenge scene that would not have been as effective had the previous sequences not been as graphic. Ultimately, it did effect my enjoyment of the film in terms of rewatchability as they are intentionally harsh scenes that are hard to shake off. Nevertheless, it is a strong start to a very promising trilogy and Lisbeth is a fantastic character!"

The basic story involves a journalist who is asked by an aging industrialist to investigate the disappearance of his niece some forty years ago. However, the investigation throws up something much darker - that there has been a serial killer who is in some way involved. The disappearance of the girl is a kind of locked room mystery, or rather an island cut off from the mainland by a blocked bridge. The film basically follows the plot of the book, with just a few changes which seem to be to fit it into the film's running time, although it still runs for two and a half hours. Does it work? On the whole I think it does, if you can accept the more improbable aspects of the plot, and credit must be given to Noomi Rapace for her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander. I found the film to be alternately gripping and repellant. I found myself wondering whether the film was condemning violence against women, or exploiting it. It seem to be a thin line there, which the film occasionally strays to the wrong side of. So a good effort, but flawed."

","I finally decided to sit down and watch the first part of the hyped 'Millennium' trilogy..and I'm glad I did. It turned out to be a surprisingly good thriller. A masterpiece compared to all the other thrillers produced in Sweden for the past ten years. They are the main reason why I've avoided this movie for so long. 'Män som hatar kvinnor' (Swedish title - literally means 'Men who hate women') has a good story. It's not that original, but it works. Also, the scenery is nice (Hollywood remake will also be filmed in Sweden). But the two main actors (Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist) are the main reason why I loved that movie so much. (They both got big Hollywood gigs after the success of this trilogy). Rapace is particularly convincing as the hacker.<br/><br/>Note: Written in 2010"

","The 'Millenium' trilogy of books is a series that has sold million of copies. A film adaptation was only a matter of time. Fortunately we are presented with an original authentic Swedish perspective which refuses to shy away from the visceral violence that the book bathed in. A disgraced reporter is hired to solve a murder case that has been unsolved for 40 years. He soon gains assistance from a professional hacker, where the two unevenly work together. It's a murder mystery, but what differentiates this from typical crime investigations is the journalistic approach and its characters. There are no elaborate car chase sequences through bustling streets or extensive shoot outs with the eventual culprit. It's more intellectually stimulating than that. Arcel's screenplay succinctly places breadcrumbs, leaving you ample opportunity to attempt to solve the case whilst the two protagonists do the same. This is then accompanied by an unconventional relationship between Lisbeth and Mikael. These two individuals are very different, yet very much alike. Their odd chemistry, and at times provocatively seductive, make them interesting and alluring. Rapace's performance is the stand out. The grunge attire and transformative makeup enhance her dominant performance. Being able to balance the vulnerability of Lisbeth, particularly during the terrifying rape scene, with the aggressive side. Nyqvist on the other hand I thought was bland for the most part, unable to make Mikael an investing character. Although he did become more involving towards the second half, particularly as he gets closer to the culprit. The pace is consistent for this long thriller, that is until the case is solved. The final twenty minutes meander slightly and lose that taut tempo that Oplev had produced. Primarily due to no progression in the story. In saying that though, the vast majority of the film was a gripping mystery that embodied the cold harsh environment of rural Sweden. Very much looking forward to the next chapter!"

","If you read the books, this film version will not disappoint you nor fail you. First I was very sad that Michael Nyqvist passed on so early. Noomi Rapace fell into Hollywood's radar because of this trilogy when she played the barbarically abused Liesbeth Salander and avenged herself and the very few souls she cared for and when she could she did with pouncing brutality. This is the crowning glory of many Skandikrimi wherein the viewer is not only taken to the cold and isolated region of Sweden where only God knows what one truly does when no one is watching, no matter how rich or reputable a family is. This film is beyond-the-grave brutal and complex. The English version was only limited to Part One ( Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara) mind you that the story is not limited to that one and does not end there. To grind your teeth and self-induce a breakdown the viewer must watch until the end of the third, only then can one piece what happened and who did what in the criminal web. It is also saddening that the author, Stieg Larsson died before completing the fourth manuscript, there's surely still a lot to come from that brilliant mind of his.

When I first watched this set of movies (before it was even thought of to be remade in a horrible fashion), I had zero idea what I was getting myself into and had no idea what to think. So I eventually checked this out from my local library and sat down to watch it.<br/><br/>Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace, who would later be in ""Prometheus"") is a devil-may-care computer hacker with her own mysterious past. Then she comes across a story by one Mikael Blomqvist, an editor for ""Millennium"" magazine, that has to deal with the mysterious disappearance of Harriet Vanger, the daughter of rich man Henrik Vanger. In the process, she runs across a number of interesting characters who try and block her progress.<br/><br/>It is eventually revealed that she is a vigilante who takes great pride in what she does and establishes a makeshift friendship with Mikael by the time the movie is over, for he saves her life from the hands of a hulking brute and a lackey or two. The two eventually part company for the time being, of course, since Lisbeth is not the type of person who likes to stick around for too long.<br/><br/>Forget about the subtitles and just enjoy the movie. Granted it has some seriously dark overtones, sit back and watch it. It has suspense, mystery, action, you name it. If you're into anti-hero female protagonists who have no problem throwing a few punches and defending themselves in rather ingenious ways, this movie is for you."

","I had heard of this film of course but didn't realize there were two of them. Now that I know, and after reading other reviewers who've compared the two, I'll look forward to the American version.<br/><br/>This was a rather engaging thriller that took the expected number of twists and turns on the way to a resolution. I found it hard to warm up to the character of Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), but by the time she got around to dealing with her thug guardian Bjurman (Peter Andersson) she won me over. The backdrop of the Swedish National Socialists and the Nazi connection to the Vanger family provided an interesting plot element, as American films don't generally delve into that sort of territory, so that made for a fresh and different perspective.<br/><br/>You have to pay attention though. There are a lot of names and relationships thrown at the viewer and it's a little difficult to follow. Having learned this long ago, I generally take notes and keep them handy while watching. This film in particular, and especially with the unfamiliar sounding foreign names, could be an unexpected challenge for many viewers. However the extra effort should prove rewarding.<br/><br/>As the story closed I couldn't help drawing a comparison to a couple of well regarded American films. The picture closes with Lisbeth having a Kyser Soze moment transforming into a completely different persona, right after having performed a Shawshank Redemption style raid on the Wennerstrom bank account. It was a triumphant ending for a character who endured all manner of degradation while involved with the Vanger case."

","""Män som hatar kvinnor"" (""Men Who Hate Women"") is an adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling novel of the same name, which was posthumously published in 2005. Better known to the English-speaking public as ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", it is the first entry in the Millennium trilogy.<br/><br/>This Swedish production, which is set in Sweden, introduces heroine Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) to movie audiences. A young female hacker with a troubled past, she aids disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) in his investigation into a forty year old missing persons case. The circumstances surrounding the disappearance are mysterious and the facts seem to point to a member of the girl's extensive family as the culprit.<br/><br/>The title ""Men Who Hate Women"" is borne out in relation to the central mystery and also in Lisbeth's dealings with her legal guardian. The violence may be a bit much for some to take but it doesn't overshadow the well-constructed detective story that propels the movie's plot.<br/><br/>The acting is unquestionably highlighted by Noomi Rapace's performance, which was justifiably nominated for a BAFTA award. She excelled in the demanding role of Lisbeth Salander, working well in tandem with male lead Michael Nyqvist. The supporting cast is uniformly convincing but largely unexceptional.<br/><br/>In terms of production values, this fairly modest film can't really be expected to compete with the big budget American version. Nevertheless, it still manages to hold its own. Director Niels Arden Oplev may not have the visual flair of David Fincher but his work here is quite satisfactory on its own terms. Similarly, the music may not be as distinctive as the American version's but it gets the job done.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I found that this adaptation of the novel seems to have the upper hand in terms of both casting and storytelling. Either way, both versions are well worth watching for any fan of mysteries or thrillers, not to mention for the stellar performances of their respective leading ladies."

Because there is little of that. The whole thing, beside investigation and mystery, is about revenge and how you should return violence with violence. It depicts evil and the fruits of evil and no real or true message about how you should deal with evil in this world beside violence. The film implicitly tell us that it's OK to kill, it's OK to beat and torture someone, if that person is already evil. It's OK to kill your father if your father abuses you. It is OK to stand and watch someone die although you can help, because that person is evil. These kinds of things are understandable but they are wrong messages to be sent into this world already full with too much evil and violence.<br/><br/>The main character of the film is presented as a woman hero, someone who is very strong, very smart, with a dark and hurtful past.

A tiny woman with a lot of attitude who is looked down upon by everyone and taken seriously by almost no one and certainly not cared about by many. She is, however, incredibly intelligent, full of fire and distrustful of everyone. With good reason.<br/><br/>The casting of Noomi Rapace is both brilliant and inspired. A rather small woman with a surprisingly strong presence and immense talent to play the shockingly resilient and strong-willed Salander.<br/><br/>The murder mystery being investigated is full of twists and has a shocking conclusion. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.<br/><br/>However, this film is extremely graphic. There is a lot of nudity, violence and material that may make some viewers very uncomfortable. This includes a brutal rape scene. And a scene where the rapist is very fittingly punished by his victim. Sexual abuse in general plays a prominent theme throughout the story. It can be difficult to watch at times. I don't think I need to say that this is not a movie for kids to be watching.<br/><br/>As a whole, though, I would highly recommend this film.

But this is the deceptive opening scene to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, a smart, uncompromising thriller that will grab you by your temples, squeeze and not let go until the very end.<br/><br/>The elderly man is Henrik Vanger (Sven Bertil-Taube), whose life is about to intersect with two unlikely protagonists and soon-to-become allies.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyquist) is a well-known investigative journalist, who has just been sued for libel by a big-time industrialist, and lost. Not only is he disgraced, but facing jail time. So ""Kalle"" Blomqvist certainly has nothing to lose, when he gets a call from none other than Vanger for the most unlikely of reasons - to help him solve the 40-year old murder case involving his niece, Harriet, whose body disappeared without a trace.<br/><br/>And unknown to Mikael, Vanger has had him thoroughly checked out before hiring him. A security company has been dogging his every move during and after the libel trial, and that includes having every bit of intel gathered on him by one of their most well-known 'specialists'...a master hacker and 'researcher' named Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace, who now can be seen in the latest SHERLOCK HOLMES adventure.) TATTOO is all about the circumstances that bring these three diverse characters together, while exploring a tale of twists and turns that also uncovers the darkest recesses of the human psyche. And as with every good noir thriller, it doesn't skimp on all the adult stuff: sexual assault, blackmail, torture, murder...and even worse.<br/><br/>Not having read a single one of the books, I am now definitely interested, but not before finishing the film series, which should be excellent if this initial entry is any indication. The cinematography is superb; the dark, brooding score complementary but not intrusive, and director Niels Arden Oplev keeps the action tight, tense and captivating in all the right places.<br/><br/>The most remarkable thing of all, though, are the performances of the leads. Nyqvist and Rapace are both outstanding, digging deep into the complexities of their characters (especially Lisbeth, who is not like any heroine you have ever seen in a suspense thriller for quite a while). It's also admirable that they aren't Hollywood-perfect...which has me worried about the David Fincher remake.<br/><br/>Because a gunfight or an explosion doesn't happen every five minutes, and it's in Swedish with English subtitles, a lot of people will probably give this a pass. Which would be a terrible mistake, because the story, direction and performances will definitely reward anyone willing to give it a shot, with one of the best 'whodunnits' to come along in years.<br/><br/>I think enough of this not just to award it a '9', but also to urge you, dear movie fan, to see this version FIRST, before you plunk down your twelve bucks for the big-budget studio 'makeover.' It's two hours well spent, I promise."

","Mikael Blomkvist is a staunch reporter, now facing jail-time for a fabricated exposé on a businessman. His face is everywhere, and he takes a leave of absence from his paper to avoid sullying its name with the scandal. With time before his sentence is carried out and nothing to lose, he agrees to investigate a 40-year-old murder case, where he partners up with a Goth expert hacker, Lisbeth Salander. The duo have an amusing odd couple dynamic, and in general, the characters are interesting and memorable. This is a deeply disturbing, gritty, brutal, dark film(albeit the amount of actual blood and gore is small; the sexual content is strong and plentiful). The thematic of authority figures abusing their power and particularly attacking women(the original title of Men Who Hate Women seems far more fitting than this ""Dragon Tattoo"" stuff, but oh well) is explored well. This has a fantastic pace, the two hour, twenty minute running time flies right by. The mystery is gripping, and it keeps you guessing whilst allowing the viewer to piece it all together as the leads do so. And the investigation isn't made easier by the entire Vanger clan being suspects for the death of, well, one of their own, so they could inherit the empire(and no two of these people can stand each other... so, really, just like any other family). That does bring me to one issue; there are entirely too many people to keep track of, specifically in this mass of potential killers. We can't remember all of them(the one aspect where that is true of this movie, and where I could see this being better as a mini-series), and it feels like a side-effect of this being a novel adaptation(I can't compare the two versions, as I have not read it), since books can spend more time delving into a large ensemble. The humor is bleak and, in a cynical way, satisfying. This has phenomenal acting, particularly by Rapace. Her role is intriguing, and you want to know more about her. This feels really credible(everyone's actions make sense) and realistic. I haven't watched this dubbed, but like I always say on this issue, deal with the subtitles. It's best in the native tongue. The DVD comes with ""exclusive""(they look like the ones they showed in theatres when these were coming out) trailers for this, the second one and a teaser for the third one. I recommend this to anyone who can handle the content. 8/10"

","What a seemingly insurmountable task to adapt and execute the multiple story lines and brimming of Stieg Larsson's novel ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Despite all the slicing and dicing (yet still a two-and-half-hour run time), credit belongs to this Swedish filmmaking team for still managing to replicate the novel's extraordinary pacing. <br/><br/>The sacrifice, unfortunately, is tone. In spite of the length, director Niels Arden Oplev makes the film into a full-on sprint. We never get a chance, with the exception of the magnetizing character that is Lisbeth Salander and Noomi Rapace's performance as her, of getting under the story's or characters' skin. We barely have enough time to really understand what kind of a character Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) is before he's engrossed in solving the film's core murder mystery. Yet despite all those complaints, would I or anyone be able to do any better without needing to make the film in two parts? I'd like to think there's a way, but I would not volunteer the man-hours necessary to carve it out.<br/><br/>""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" tells the story of a business reporter named Mikael Blomqvist who ends up disgraced when he loses a libel suit thanks to faulty information used in an article trying to take down a billionaire. Needing to lay low, he receives a call from another rich businessman, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taub), who offers Blomqvist ridiculous compensation to work on solving a 40-year-old mystery involving Vanger's missing niece, who he believes was murdered.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lisbeth Salander (Rapace) is an information collector (aka hacker) with a troubled past and a number of tattoos and piercings who is doing her own research on Blomqvist and ultimately ends up getting wrapped up in solving the mystery as well.<br/><br/>Although iffy on what it cuts from the book and what it alters, the adaptation succeeds at juxtaposing a lot of separate scenes in the novel into one sequence in the film. A common method for combining story lines and sub plots, this is particularly effective in picking up the suspense. As such, the film flows well and the key moments like the end and some pivotal events in the Salander subplot do not lack the impact or intensity that they require.<br/><br/>""Dragon Tattoo"" moves at an entertaining clip, but never engulfs you like the novel and that will ultimately lead countless people to declare the books ""so much better."" The themes, tone and depth simply do not exist. I imagine some of the production elements such as cinematography and a better score come with a lack of budget too, so that doesn't help matters.

"KathleenML","5","3","8","11 July 2010"," Big Disappointment for Readers of the Actual Book
","If you have read the book like I, you will be more than likely disappointed at the departure the movie took from the book. I realize they had to cram a big book in 2.5 hours, but was it necessary to change important key factors in the book to do that? Here are two BIG issues with the movie that I felt should not have been changed <br/><br/>1. The timeline of events is nothing like the book. When played events that happened after Mikael got out of jail I figure they took his jail time out of the movie, but were left blown away to see they depicted his time in jail in a 100% inaccurate way. <br/><br/>2. Two very important characters are cut out of the movie. Anita wasn't dead in the book and Mikael's daughter figured out what the numbers in Harriet's diary stood for before Mikael even knew about Lisbeth. <br/><br/>Other than those two, there were some major departures from the book that were irritating as a reader of the book, for example Mikael and Erika's relationship, Henrik'sinvolvement with Millennium, the issue with Wennerström. And some small details like how Mikael tracked down the lady from the photograph and the cloths Martin was wearing. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie itself wasn't bad. In my opinion, the book was more graphic than the movie, so that didn't surprise me. If I hadn't read the book I would probably have a lot higher opinion of the movie. Watch the movie, it's not bad, but don't let the movie cloud your judgment of the book if you have not yet read it."

","Noomi Rapace plays Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I don't know why she has it or where she got it, because the US version of the film is only 152 minutes. Perhaps it is in the Swedish version at 180 minutes or for sure it must be in the book.<br/><br/>If you don't know from the US title you are seeing ""Men Who Hate Women"" you sure find out fast. One guy is a sadistic rapist pig and he isn't the worst of the lot.<br/><br/>Art imitates life when Lisbeth takes a golf club to a guy and his SUV. Like Tiger Wood's wife, if you are into punk this girl is a nineteen. That's a ten with a nine iron.<br/><br/>At 152 minutes there is plenty of time for story and back story to explain almost everything. Still there are holes that you can drive a truck through and you have to wonder why the police hadn't solved the old murder cases with the evidence there for the two super sleuths to patiently uncover.<br/><br/>The movie is dark and it looks on the dark dreary side with color that is just enough off to make the white snow blueish. The score is often loud and warns of foreboding. It's a film that makes you appreciate the genius of Hitchcock and the scores of Bernard Herman.<br/><br/>If murder, rape, incest, mutilation and graphic violence is your idea of a good time at the movies you will not be disappointed.

I have to say that the acting is fantastic and convincing, as is the directing. I hope to see more of these actors and actresses. I must keep an eye out for other films they have been in or will make, as it is not so easy to see some lesser known Swedish films here in UK.<br/><br/>In this particular episode, we learn of related crimes and why possibly Lisbeth is being targeted.

"Chris Knipp","Null","3","8","28 March 2010"," Very bad rich people
","It should not be too hard to enjoy the new movie, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' Rarely does the art house audience receive such a juicy piece of stuff as this gruesome Swedish serial killer mystery. The format is spruced up with a kinky investigator romance replacing Sherlock-Watson camaraderie. The background material, exploring which fills up most of the lengthy 150-minute screen time, is made up of shocker family history reaching back to nail big-time European industrialists as not only Nazis but sadistic criminals. This is as good a time as any for some very bad rich people. The investigative unreeling of the story, which comes from the first in a ""Millennium"" trilogy of international bestsellers, has parallels with Fincher's splendid 'Zodiac.' The production values of this gory Swedish film are excellent and the acting is impeccable, starting with Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander. As the twisted little lesbian computer hacker with the tattoo and piercings and dyed-black punk hair who teams up with indicted yet charismatic investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), Rapace eagerly gobbles her role.<br/><br/>There's only one trouble. 'Zodiac' is scrupulously faithful to lurid Seventies America criminology. Despite the detectives' ample use of up-to-date technology, 'Girl' just feels too much like old-fashioned Euro-trash fantasy. It makes the bad guys bad in every conceivable way, starting out with the offense of being mega-rich capitalists and moving on quickly to anti-Semitism and misogyny; the original film/book title means ""Men Who Hate Women."" The story line runs so far to sensationalism there's no room for complexity except of plot twists. You're well entertained if flaying, hanging, rape and immolation are recurrent fantasies of yours. But the reliance on showing gore and violence is unnecessary. It's different in a novel where one only imagines them. Director Oplev has overly jazzed Larsson's already hysterical catalogs of vice. Zodiac managed to be scarier without actually showing its serial killings, something Fincher learned between 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac.' You can't help feeling jacked around by Stieg Larsson's novel as director Niels Arden Oplev has transferred it to the screen. There's a certain irony in this, since Stieg Larsson himself was a genuine expert on racist hate crimes and right-wing conspiracies. However, he wouldn't be the first expert to tart up his information too much in molding it into fiction.<br/><br/>Another reason for the film's unsatisfying aftertaste is that as so often with book (I won't say ""literary"") adaptations, the movie suffers from the burden of conveying too much material in too little screen time. To begin with we're fed a lot of information. We learn that the dysfunctional, ultra-rich Vanger industrialist family is ripping off government funding to set up a fake business in Russia, and that the journalist Mikael Blomqvist, who publishes the magazine Millennium in Stockholm, has just lost a libel case brought by accused Swedish industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström, which could cause Millennium to go down. In disgrace, Blomkvist agrees to be hired by Vanger, the aged former Vanger companies CEO, Henrik. The old man offers both to rescue Blomqvist's magazine and to supply him with proof of Wennerström's corruption. Blomqvist is officially to spend a year writing the Vanger family history, but the elderly Vanger wants him in fact to go back and solve the case of his niece's disappearance from the family's privately owned island 40 years ago. He's convinced a family member did away with the girl, and he trusts Blomqvist as a journalist -- and no doubt sees he's no publicist for the Vanger family.<br/><br/>All that adds up to a pretty big dose of introductory exposition.<br/><br/>When he comes to the island to work on the case, Blomqvist very quickly begins to see the connection of a series of country-wide murders stretching from the forties into the present. Meanwhile the movie simultaneously starts to fill us in on the story of the Dragon Girl. Evidently she was hospitalized for violent behavior earlier in her life and must still report to a state ""guardian."" When a new replacement comes he turns out to be an repulsive sex pervert who bribes and threatens Lisbeth while abusing her; then she gets ample revenge. These scenes are creepy, violent, and disturbing. Ingeniously, the plot brings Lisbeth and Blomqvist together by having Lisbeth hack into his investigation -- and contribute to it, when she has insights into the possible serial killing he has found.<br/><br/>The fascination of Larsson's ""Millennium Trilogy"" evidently arises very much from these two personalities, Blomqvist and Elsbeth, both complex and conflicted, who are gradually drawn together and even become a couple despite Elsbeth's violent, traumatic past and lesbian leanings. This has to be one of the more original detective couples. In contrast the stories of hate, rape, murder, and incest that emerge in the investigation seem at once excessive and conventional. Though we don't really learn quite as much as we'd like to about Blomqvist and Elsbeth's back stories, they still tend to seem more interesting and three-dimensional than the hackneyed catalog of vices served up for the Vangers. These Euro-trash megabucks folks veer into Hannibal Lector territory, but they're not clever or fiendish like Hannibal, just awfully, awfully nasty. The film ends with a resolution of the mystery that is pretty corny and pat, as well as once again breathless and overcomplicated. For the next ""Millennium"" film -- and there's an American remake of Part I already planned -- I'll need more and better synonyms for ""lurid."" And I hope the filmmakers get hold of some better-formatted English subtitles. Of these, at least ten or fifteen percent were illegible.<br/><br/>'Män som hatar kvinnor' (the Swedish title) was released March 19, 2010 in the US."

I was slightly shocked to see that what the book takes over 130 pages to do, the film does in (first) five minutes. I was also very concerned that if I hadn't read the book, much of what I saw would be incomprehensible. It appeared to be a collection of set scenes from the book without allowing the story to flow from one scene to the other. I was expecting something .other. than a Biblically crazed sex attacker, with some money. I had an inkling who the Killer was, but also expected that Harriet would turn out to be Lizbet Salanders Mother in a Mental Home.

She has led a dark life after a horrible upbringing. She has been abused by the ""system."" She hooks up with a high profile investigative reporter who is known as a bit of a womanizer. The two find themselves in the middle of a case involving the disappearance, many years before, of the daughter of a very rich man. This leads them to uncover many unsettling facts.

Michael Nyqvist as Michael Blomkvist was charismatic and surprisingly sexy in the lead male role. I felt a real connection to both characters.

Mikael has 6-months before he goes to jail<br/><br/>I know Hollywood is about to do the American remake of this film, but if you want to see a really engaging and well done story by actors who deserve Oscars, then go get this one. There are sub-titles, but they are short and not at all distracting. However, of course, if you know the Swedish language then the sub-titles would probably be a distraction. <br/><br/>This is probably the most engaging mystery thriller I have seen since The Ghost Writer.

"Eternality","9","2","5","16 August 2010"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an outstanding serial killer mystery-thriller, and one of the best films of 2010.
","Based on the immensely popular novel of the same name by the late Stieg Larsson, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an outstanding serial killer mystery-thriller, and one of the best films of the year. The first part of the ""Millennium Trilogy"", Dragon Tattoo precedes The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, both of which are already made into films in Sweden. Such is the anticipation for their release outside Sweden that many filmgoers are beginning to hop around in excitement.<br/><br/>Directed by Niels Arden Oplev, who works mainly in television, Dragon Tattoo is a remarkable effort in feature length filmmaking. Oplev shows exquisite skill in crafting a mystery-thriller that is never formulaic, expressing the desire to deliver a picture whose characters are more important than the story, which in itself is already fascinating to begin with. He takes his time to flesh out the two lead characters by providing viewers with more than a summary of their current life situation, and slices of their past that they could not forget, giving the leads an uncommon depth.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) and Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) are the two leads. The former is a disgraced financial journalist who is waiting to serve his jail term in six months' time. The latter is a genius computer hacker who is sexually taken advantage of by her sadistic caretaker. The first half of the film documents these two characters separately, only bringing them together much later. By that time, the film's murder mystery has become so engrossing that it threatens to overshadow its characters. Yet, it does not.<br/><br/>The story follows Mikael who is paid to pursue an unsolvable case of a young woman who disappeared forty years ago from an island. Through old-school journalistic techniques, and with the help of Lisbeth's prowess in IT, he uncovers a chilling cultish plot by a Nazi sympathizer who rapes, tortures, and kills women. When the real identity of the killer is revealed at the end, it may not be much of a shocker. However, it is the journey towards that revelation that is integral to the haunting cinematic experience as created by Oplev.<br/><br/>Dragon Tattoo is frightening and it crawls deep under your skin. Mikael sticks loads of old, black-and-white photographs of suspects on his wall to organize his thoughts and try to find links or clues that would shed light on the mystery. Oplev shoots extreme close-ups of these photographs, as if they are blown up to the proportions of a theatre screen. Looking at them gives a creepy feel akin to literally staring into the eyes of a cold-blooded murderer. Repeated exposure to these photos build suspense, of which it cumulates in the film's most unnerving sequence when Mikael breaks into a suspect's house to find criminal evidence.<br/><br/>Dragon Tattoo clocks in at about 150 minutes, which makes the film a long (but still satisfying) ride. However, it turns rather draggy in the final twenty minutes as Oplev tries to tie up all the loose ends. The film has been such a competent example of storytelling that cutting the entire final segment would not have caused any problems other than irritating a handful of Larsson's more vocal fans.<br/><br/>David Fincher, the reputable director of Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007), both of which share eerie similarities with the style and content of Dragon Tattoo, is set to direct the Hollywood remake of Oplev's film. I usually condemn any news of Hollywood remaking foreign language pictures, but Fincher's Dragon Tattoo is something I would really love to see.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
"estebangonzalez10","9","2","5","10 August 2010"," An engaging dark thriller
","¨He was a man who hated women¨ Perhaps this quote is what better summarizes the movie which is based on Stieg Larsson's best selling novel ¨Män som hatar kvinnor¨ which is the first book of the Millennium trilogy he wrote. The title has been translated in English as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, a very attractive one, but not as strong as the literary Swedish translation which means The Men Who Hated Women. Larsson died in 2004, before these books were published and became worldwide sensations, but the trilogy was complete and once they were published his first book sold over 8 million copies. Now, his books have been turned into movies and these films have become a great success overseas. A Hollywood remake of these movies are sure to come our way soon, but it would be better to check out the Swedish versions first which were all released last year. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was directed by danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev (who directed the danish award winning film We Shall Overcome) and the novel was adapted for the screenplay by Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg. The film tried to stay faithful to the novel although there were some changes, but the dark mood and the violent scenes remain. Many people were turned down because of the strong violent and sexual scenes in the film which were very realistic and gruesome, but I think they really helped set the tone of the film and explain the characters motivations. The location of the film also contributed to the overall dark mood and helped build the suspense and tension. This was just one of the best suspense thrillers of the year and reminded me of Fincher's masterpiece, Se7en.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is a journalist who works for Millennium magazine in Sweden and has recently been sued by a business tycoon named Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Stefan Sauk) for libel against him. The truth is that Blomkvist has been framed and the proof he had against Wennerstrom was false so he is sentenced to three months in prison. He has six months before beginning his sentence and he receives a job proposition from Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), a former CEO of the Vanger group, who lives in an isolated island along with the rest of the members of the rich family. Henrik has hired Mikael because he wants him to investigate what happened to his disappeared niece, Harriet, who he believes has been murdered by someone in his family forty years ago, although police officers haven't been able to find any clues over the years. The reason Henrik hasn't given up looking for the killer is that every year on his birthday he receives a portrait with a flower as a gift from different parts of the world that he presumes is from the killer. He says that the killer has to be someone from the family because there was an accident on the bridge the day Harriet disappeared and no one could get in or out of the island on that day so it couldn't be an outsider. Henrik loved Harriet very much and took good care of her because her mother was irresponsible and her father died an year before she vanished. Henrik's brothers were all Nazi sympathizers during the War and he suspects one of them is the killer. Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) is a computer hacker who is pretty good at what she does, but is a very troublesome teenager who has very poor social skills. She was hired by a security agency to follow Mikael during the trial and became very interested in him even after her work was done. She hacks into his computer and begins helping him with the case. Together they decide to dig back in the past, but someone isn't too happy about it.<br/><br/>The film works as a very dark and intelligent thriller. I think the film was adapted very well from the suspenseful novel and that the movie has a darker Agatha Christie feeling too it. There are a lot of mysteries to be solved and the lead characters are interesting. Noomi Rapace is the true star of the film and she carries this movie brilliantly as her character is probably the most mysterious of them all, but we begin to understand her motivations as the film progresses and we get glimpses of her past. She gave a terrific performance and her very flawed character still makes for a hero who we sympathize with because she is a victim. I really enjoyed how the movie unfolded and how the mystery was built and resolved. I was expecting for the movie to have an open ending because I knew it was a trilogy, but I was surprised to find out that it actually had a decent closed ending. I really enjoyed this movie and am looking forward to seeing the sequels.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

This held every element of dark crime, great mystery story, leads that seemed to come to a dead end, yet finds new light. The emotional baggage that Lisbeth held herself would have made a new story altogether, but both give this film a great hoist with some romance, regret, sadness, and forgiveness. A wonderful tale that fits the thriller category."

","One of the stronger films, that the Scandinavians have produced in recent years. And I must admit- one of the best (if not the best) movie that I've seen lately.<br/><br/>""Girl with a dragon tattoo"" definitely has some rough scenes and certainly can't be called ""light Hollywood-like entertainment"", but that's one of the things that make this film so particularly appealing.<br/><br/>It's done rather simply, it isn't flashy. But the scenery itself is beautiful enough, and the actors have a certain look to them, a different approach to acting- those things combined create a fresh, vibrant experience.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this film if you're looking just for fun, light, relaxing evening movie. However, it isn't exactly the regular usually depressing and mentally demanding European film either. All in all- it's a film, that should be watch by every film lover."

","Loved this film and hope the US cinema doesn't remake it as it is fine as it is. Noomi is superb in bringing the character Lisbeth to life. All in all I can't wait for ""Fire"", and ""Hornets Nest"". Currently reading the books and don't find that precise following of the book doesn't take anything away from the film. Provocative and a grabber! I really loved the look of the film from the onset and give props to the set dressers and location scouts for making this gritty looking piece. Why remake something that is good even if it's in a foreign language? I didn't find the subtitles to be distracting at all. Anti hero is an understatement here as Lisbeth has layer upon layer of interest. Bring it on, and please don't stop at 3. This is refreshing and I'd compare it to the US made Bourne series."
"siderite","9","2","5","26 June 2010"," Good thriller movie
","The feel of the movie is similar to that of the first ""Les rivières pourpres"" film. Same high class isolated community, a mystery and some people investigating it. Based on the first book in the Millennium trilogy, written by Stieg Larsson, it follows an investigative reporter and a girl hacker trying to find the killer in a 40 years old murder.<br/><br/>The plot is complex and each character has their own definite personality and story. The actors are playing well, too, even the ones in secondary roles, which adds to the overall atmosphere. I am not a big fan of the mystery thriller, but I enjoy the occasional well done film and this is clearly one of those. Given that the movie will be remade by the Americans, with actors like Daniel Craig and Carey Mulligan, other people have thought the same as me. I would still recommend seeing the Swedish version first, though.<br/><br/>Bottom line: really good mystery thriller, the only one in the trilogy that can be watched standalone, I think. The other two don't bother presenting the characters and are obvious continuations of the same story. There will be a US remake in 2012, but I say you should not wait for it and watch the Swedish version."

But the book was unbelievable and a lot is left out (probably out of necessity because there are just so many nuances/plot layers in the book).<br/><br/>The acting was very good - the lead actress was really perfect for the role.<br/><br/>While there were some brutal scenes, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be as I can be on the squeamish side.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie, and the book is among the best I've ever read.

","An exceptionally well done version of the novel of the same name about a profoundly dysfunctional young woman computer genius who teams up with a disgraced male journalist on the verge of middle age to investigate the disappearance 40 years ago of the great-niece of a wealthy industrialist. Readers of the book will not be disappointed in this excellent film treatment. Some subplots and characters were discarded or altered, but the book was so densely plotted that was inevitable. The two leads are both compelling but Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander is absolutely spellbinding. She has the perfect combination of toughness and vulnerability with a hint of possible psychopathy. You cannot take your eyes off her while she is on screen. The movie is very violent in some scenes, a violence that women will be much more sensitive to. There are rape scenes that are graphically violent although not sexually graphic. Some may not regard these as very violent simply because they do not involve blood or gore but they are very disturbing and hard to watch. Salander's revenge is a little more traditionally violent. There are some scenes that foreshadow the second book (The Girl Who Played With Fire) as well as cover the material from the first book. To fans and non-fans alike, I recommend this movie highly. The likelihood of an American version soon to come is quite depressing. Don't wait for it. See the original Swedish version."
"ferguson-6","8","2","5","18 April 2010"," An Untrainable Dragon
","Greetings again from the darkness. What usually sets apart a great mystery thriller from an average one is the story. In part one of the Millennium trilogy based on Stieg Larsson's books, the story is really good, but the point of difference comes in the titular performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth. American audiences are rarely treated to this type of raw, gritty performance from an actress. She alone makes the film worth seeing.<br/><br/>Please don't get me wrong ... I really like the film. A murder mystery who-dunnit that on the surface appears like an Agathy Christie story, it quickly proves to us how looks can be deceiving - both in story line and in characters. Though the story wraps up a bit too neatly, the long winding road (over a fortuitous bridge) gives us a wild ride of hints, suspects and research that is a blast for those who enjoy such things.<br/><br/>Michael Nyqvist stars as Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative writer who gets set up on charges of libel against a powerful businessman. While awaiting his jail time, Blomkvist is hired by an 80 year old uncle of a girl gone missing some 40 years ago. Oh yes, she is part of the Vanger family who live on a private island and who have multiple members with a history of Nazi loyalties. As Blomkvist investigates the ancient mystery, it turns out he is being followed via super-hacker Lisbeth. After a few twists, these two turn into a highly unlikely, but very interesting and effective mystery-solving couple.<br/><br/>Besides the performance of Rapace, what really sets this one apart is that the villains really aren't the most interesting characters - Blomkvist and Lisbeth are. We are treated to a great deal of character development for both, and trust me when I say, Lisbeth's story is not pleasant.<br/><br/>I hear this will be Americanized in the remake and that makes me sad. The edgy undercurrent of sex, abuse, politics and religious racism will undoubtedly be softened and surely the lead actress will bring little of the fascination that Noomi Rapace delivers."
"aharmas","10","2","5","25 March 2010"," The truth is not so simple
","Nothing is simple here; there is a high level of complexity to the mystery at the heart of the story, and that drives the film ferociously to the very satisfying ending, one that will not leave cheated or confused. The movie is finely tuned, giving the audience much respect for their intelligence, and plenty of pleasure, as old cobwebs are cleared up and the thriller builds up its tension, captivating us, introducing us to memorable characters. These are full of flaws and demons, forces that control and haunt them, leading them to perform actions that could be either punishing, purgatory, or cleansing. Much is left to be the imagination of the viewer, as if the need to know adds excitement to the chase and the hunt.<br/><br/>Much of the fascination centers around the performance of the mysterious female investigator. The character is intense, hurt, angry, and resolute to find justice. It is clear that something tortures her, and her desire to tie loose ends serves some sort of purpose not clear to us, and it is possible the resolution to these questions would eventually be known to us. What is most obvious is that we have discovered a fantastic new fictional character, one who is powerful, creative, astute, and dangerous. Much in the way Clarisse in ""Silence of The Lambs"" needs darkness to help her recover from earlier trauma, Salander has plenty of emotional baggage, and her fury is the fuel that keeps her going. At times, it blinds her, with her rage take plenty of risky chances.<br/><br/>In the end, the mystery at the heart of the film is solved, and there are shocking revelations, a couple of action pieces, giving us a peek into the distorted mind of the criminal, and a glimpse into what our heroine's past might be.<br/><br/>There is a powerful and complex family in the middle of the interesting plot, one with its set of skeletons in the closet, one that is not shown in the kindest of lights; yet there is careful peeling of the layers, and much resistance to bait us with unnecessary red herrings. The introduction of possible leads is done intelligently, as rays of lights and color to add more dimension to the story and the characters.<br/><br/>""Girl"" is dark and intense, with people who live complicated lives and have met or seen pain in horrible ways. We don't see the episodes themselves,but see the results of those events, and how they might have shaped their future. It is not a comic book character, but one with real dark forces lurking in the past, and we are left hungry for future revelations. It's satisfying to know writers are still coming up with original story lines, and that somehow these make it to the movies. People familiar with the series also have reasons to be frustrated, but if this film is a sign of what is to come, three might be our magic number."

"MegaBowman","8","3","11","8 April 2010"," Here's what should have happened...
","This review is intended for those who have seen this movie already.<br/><br/>In summary the movie was well considered, and the convergence of the characters was done without any noticeable problem. As the story revealed itself, it produced some powerful scenes and thrilling moments.<br/><br/>The movie touched on just enough uncomfortable activities such as rape, violence, racism and corporate malpractice to make the movie engaging.<br/><br/>However, I believe as the viewer of this film, it would have been MUCH more powerful if we saw a change in Lisbeth's character. At the end of the movie, its uncomfortable for me to see her being entertained by the same things the entertained the people she investigated.<br/><br/>Lisbeth's character should have evolved. What lessons have we learned from the film? Did she not learn anything from Mikael? What should have happened in my eyes is that after she let the murderer burn and have Mikael give his thoughts on the matter, there should have been another opportunity for Lisbeth to make a mends as a person.<br/><br/>This would have substantiated her theory of ""everyone has the same chance and make their choices in life"". It would have been nice to see her face the same situation between saving someone bad or letting them burn, and to see her make that decision to not be the ""punisher"" in life.<br/><br/>To have a final scene of her walking away with money as a result of a corporation profiting from third-world drug cartels was a big disappointment and didn't do her powerful role justice. She did not learn anything, and it leaves us sitting there in discomfort as we being dealt the ridiculous lesson of ""If someone does you bad, then you should do the same or worse back"".<br/><br/>I actually think it would have been nice also to have been given more detail as to why she burnt her own father. We know why, but there was so much detail in her subsequent actions in life that we can't compare it to much about how bad she was treated.<br/><br/>The scene with the mother could have been more powerful, and would have been a great opportunity to flash back to the horrors of abusive husband. The balance wasn't there, we know more about HER horrific behavior than that of her father. It was too imbalanced.<br/><br/>If this movie ends up having sequels, then a better ending would have been Lisbeth handing over her medical file instead of the corporate file and have Mikael learn about her OR still have her give her investigation of the corporate file but end with the start of Mikael typing on his laptop. We don't need to be dragged into another story and then they rush through scenes of another investigation.<br/><br/>It so unfortunate that everything else was so good, but the movie failed so horribly in it's ability to teach us anything good. But, it was definitely an entertaining 2 1/2 hours but its sad I can walk away with hope for myself and others."

","Watching ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" felt the same as watching an average Criminal Minds episode (not the good ones).<br/><br/>The plot is about a crime investigation, where a journalist and a computer hacker team up to find the murderer of a rich man's teenage niece a few decades ago.<br/><br/>The plot is filled with a series of useless subplots whose only purpose seem to be:<br/><br/>a) Justify the later behavior of the female lead (yes, she can let a guy burn in flames as we already saw what she did with her parole officer)<br/><br/>b) Give screen time to actors whose characters play no relevant role in the story<br/><br/>c) Explain (in very long 30 minutes) that the journalist is facing false accusations and is a honest man, thus the perfect guy for the job - who conveniently happens to have been babysitted by the missing girl during his childhood at the rich man's house.<br/><br/>The pace is so slow with two parallel story lines that come together only in the last half of the movie, and someone could die of boredom before the duo solves the mystery.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, but there is no sense of isolation, which is expected from a movie set on a island that is connected to the mainland by a single bridge - oh sure, the reason for setting the story on an island is to make possible the photo evidence on which the whole investigation is based on.<br/><br/>All in all, the plot does not connect well and is just another one of those hyped movies which fail to deliver what they promise.

Consequently, the film has major continuity issues. Who are the characters? Why do they come into play? All this is so fuzzy ! <br/><br/>The most interesting part of watching a mystery is, to me at least, the way the detective goes about unraveling the mystery. The book does this brilliantly, almost at a real time pace, which makes it a bit too fat, but the movie shows none of that. Lisbeth does not crack the code of the verses. She does not match the photographs to note that the guy wearing blue sweater is Martin in the pictures. Also, Anita Vanger (the real one) is not dead in the novel and locating Harriet is not as simple as a Google search of Anita Vanger. <br/><br/>I am just so mad for them butchering up the novel.

","This superb cinematic adaptation of the novel captures all of the intense drama and intrigue of the main story while justifiably (and mercifully) abridging the details of the rather mundane and yawn-inducing narrative frame that sets up the central plot. The film, however, is rather long (over two and a half hours), but it definitely rewards the time investment—the performances are excellent, the story is engrossing, and the plot graphically illustrates the original Swedish title of the film (""Men Who Hate Women""). I suspect that the length of the film, combined with the need to read subtitles (along with many Americans' cinematic chauvinism), explains why most Americans will not see this movie but will instead wait for the altogether unnecessary American remake (starring Daniel Craig). Their loss. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is one of the best intelligent thrillers of the last few years."

Again, no problem. It could not have been done better--only enough is shown so that you know exactly what is going on and can feel the anguish. But there is no gratuitous or unnecessary violence shown. Kudos to the director for making great choices and to the actors for their brilliant portrayals.<br/><br/>The casting is superb. I know that some people do not like to see films with subtitles, but I am really wondering if the American version will in any way be able to even come close to the beauty and brilliance of this film.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to read the books and then see this beautiful and haunting film, which provides another way to experience this intense, idealistic and inspiring story."

Not only for the suspense, but for the idea of how a young Goth woman uses her computer smarts to help an embattled journalist solve a forty-year-old murder in a Swedish town. The movie also incorporates the history of the Nazis in Sweden (although that country avoided involvement in WWII).<br/><br/>It is just amazing how they let the story evolve. I couldn't have come up with something that clever if I'd tried. I really liked it when Lisbeth teaches that one guy a lesson! But above all, this is definitely one that I recommend.

","What I liked about this film is that, even though there is a conventional plot to it, there were multiple simultaneous plot lines, all of which were developed superbly and with an eye to telling the story of Liv. The male protagonist doesn't really go through a major shift, besides having his mysteries solved, like Sherlock Holmes or Indiana Jones. Also, the rape of Liv was one of the most disturbing things I've seen in films, yet I didn't mind it being there (unlike in other films where I sometimes get the sense the filmmaker just has a fetish- ""lust, caution""). The effect? Liv becomes a living breathing character. I liked her. I thought she was totally believable as a hateful lovable bad-ass."

","The first of a trilogy based on Steig Larsson's bestselling novels, Dragon Tattoo is a macabre, yet fascinating, story that will stick you for a long time. Scribes Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Hiesterberg have successfully transferred the intense content from book to script, complete with interesting, multi-layered characters, ambiguously intriguing sub-plots and a highly-intelligent and mature theme – all of which demand your undivided attention. The complex plot will be most appreciated by those who don't mind thinking through a movie whilst those who just want to switch off may struggle to keep up.<br/><br/>Danish director Oplev treats his material with the utmost respect. Every shot is crafted meticulously, nothing in the frame is filler. Every word has importance, every look a meaning. The hard-to-swallow moments are handled with such care that their impact is strengthened, causing some scenes to be very difficult to watch, despite nothing overtly gratuitous being shown on screen. It's the lingering looks or the animalistic sounds that get under your skin, it's the malevolent sneer of one particularly evil character before he commits a heinous crime that'll get you angry. But this is Oplev's objective. Sexual abuse, murder, abduction, torture – these aren't issues that are meant to be brushed aside, no matter how uneasy it makes you feel.<br/><br/>Getting most of the critical plaudits so far has been Noomi Rapace and it's easy to see why. Her gravitas performance as the complicated Lisbeth is filled with subtle nuances and unspoken feeling. Rapace manages to beguile us with her busy eyes; something is always going on behind them and we can't help but wonder. But if Lisbeth is Dragon Tattoo's Joker, then Blomkvist is its Batman and Michael Nyqvist does a solid job in the less-meatier role, shrouding Blomkvist in restrained emotion that adds an extra level of interest.<br/><br/>This Swedish film is a tremendous, multifaceted drama / thriller that deserves a viewing at the cinema.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","I have heard of the substantial changes in the plot from the novel's. Usually in cases like these it will cost the movie a huge rating off my list for distorting the original source material, unless it is for a good reason. But so what? Just by solely comparing this to the American remake, this is still much better as a movie, due to the following reasons: plot flow makes more sense (many things that were not conveyed properly in the American version is explained very well here), more development flow especially from the lead characters (you get to hear more of their thoughts) as compared to the 'plastic' facade of the lead characters in the American version. And setting-wise, it looks more realistic to me. Actions make more sense. For example, how the American version of Lisbeth is able to, all by herself, physically intrude upon so many P&C files, across secured buildings without much disruption or paperwork, and in such a short time, is such an imaginary James Bond-feel that will never happen in real life. In this Swedish version, her research relies more on hacking and on third parties to carry out her work. The Lisbeth in this version is less omnipresent in a way, which is in turn more believable."

","Haven't read the book or seen the Hollywood remake, but having recently enjoyed the likes of ""Borgen"" on TV I wanted to experience the Swedish original adaptation of the Stiegg Larssen best-seller (subtitled version). I wasn't disappointed. An ingeniously plotted whodunnit thriller, it cleverly sets out its stall, clues, suspects and all and weaves them all together before tying up every loose end by the final scene. It also gives us the unforgettable character of Lisbeth, the punk-ish computer hacker whose distrust and resentment against patrician older men is explained much later in the piece, at the same time completing her identification with the missing girl at the heart of the story. <br/><br/>Probably the most unforgettable scenes are those where she is firstly forcibly raped by her appointed guardian and even more so in the graphic scene where she takes her revenge. I was however unconvinced by her trysts with the investigative middle-aged journalist with whom she forms an unlikely alliance to crack the case, not least as we had previously seen her in bed with another female much earlier.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the Morse-like attention to detail in the 40 year-old mystery, based on the intense scrutiny of snap-shot photography at a town parade and the ""Se7en""-like use of themed murders, where the key to the killer's motives are referenced in Biblical quotations. I can forgive this plagiarism when it's as skilfully managed as it is here. Yes, it is asking a lot to swallow that a witness on the same day so long ago would retain an insignificant picture which unwittingly contains the killer's image, but I'll give it the dramatic licence it needs, as it was still an intriguing plot device.<br/><br/>There's a terrific, heart-stopping climax at the killer's lair when Lisbeth comes to reporter Nvqvisst's nick-of-time's rescue immediately followed by an arresting scene where she presumably at last expunges her own demons by refusing to spare the by now helpless killer. The acting throughout is superb by the whole cast and the photography marvellously evocative of the appropriately cold desolate Swedish landscape, the setting for the horrendous crimes. The background music too was apposite and unobtrusive. I look forward to the two successors with relish even if it seems unlikely, given Lisbeth's transformation and migration to sunnier climes in the final moments."

","This is a review of, Män som hatar kvinnor, also known as ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" the first of the European films based on the Swedish novels written by Steig Larsson. Bruno Wang loves this series...far better than vampires or witches! It is the first in the successful trilogy of Swedish films based on the popular ""Millennium"" book trilogy that includes, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.<br/><br/>This is not a comparison between the European and the American version with Daniel Craig. Both of the films have strong points in their own right. Män som hatar kvinnor is the original 'first film' and it stays very true to the story telling plot of the book series. In addition, it develops the characters on a very deep and emotional level.<br/><br/>In Män som hatar kvinnor, we are introduced to the highly complex Lisbeth Salander (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) and given deep insight into her troubled past and her underlying beliefs about good and evil, right and wrong. All of the main characters are brought to us in a much richer and meaningful way so that we get a true sense of drama as the plot unfolds.<br/><br/>The story surrounds journalist Mikael Blomqvist who must take his leave from Millennium magazine after losing a disgraceful libel against a Swedish power broker. Shortly after receiving a jail sentence and fine for libel, Blomqvist is hired by one of Sweden's wealthiest business tycoons, Henrik Vanger. Vanger hires Blomqvist to try to solve a 40 year old murder mystery involving his niece Harriet.<br/><br/>What Salander and Blomqvist quickly discover is the Vanger family has a dark and sordid past and they eventually uncover that certain Vanger family members were involved in brutal, ritualistic serial murders involving young women. The movie is very graphic in its presentation of sexual themes and violence. It is also clear to the viewer that Salander has experienced her own severe emotional trauma - which ultimately leads to her being a champion of the film and a champion of women.<br/><br/>The main theme is that of the hero, Salander, and her ability, along with Blomqvist, to piece together clues in order to solve a four decade murder mystery involving the deaths of young women. However, unlike the American version, in this film we see the real complexity of the hero Lisbeth. When Martin Vangar dies in the fire following the crash of his automobile Blomqvist asks her if she could have saved him and Salander replies; ""Yes. But he was evil and he hated women..."" Blomqvist then says that is something he could never do. This powerful scene helps set the stage for the next two European films in the trilogy, it helps us to understand the workings of Lisbeth and leaves it to us to judge her actions.<br/><br/>I give this film a Bruno Wang 5 out of 5 stars. Män som hatar kvinnor succeeds in telling a rich story line about the struggle of a young woman who has experienced deep emotional trauma. The film is gripping and also filled at times with very disturbing imagery."

","I felt like writing about the movie after watching David Fincher's remake of the movie, which i felt was totally pointless and was no way better than the Swedish original. Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, is a computer hacker who draws a few 'raised eyebrows' with her sartorial and tonsorial preferences. She's consigned to a sex-starved businessman after the death of her mother. The man who is supposed to take care of her, takes advantage of her for she's dependent on him for allowances and uses her to satisfy his sexual pleasures. Mikael, a financial journalist buried in a scandal, is hired by wealthy patriarch Harriet Vanger to solve the case of his missing daughter. Lisbeth helps Mikael find out every single detail pertaining to the events before and after the missing of Mr.Vanger's beloved daughter. They finally crack the case. Lisbeth helps Mikael prove his innocence; he is found 'not guilty' of the conviction. Lisbeth uses her expertise in hacking to rake in billions of Swedish kronas and flees the country disguised as a blonde.<br/><br/>It is one of the best thriller movies of the modern day with a totally unpredictable plot. Noomi Rapace's performance will perhaps remain the best performance by an actress in a leading role in a foreign language film for a long time. The editing of the movie couldn't have been better, quite exquisite. A well-made thriller."

","Noomi Rapace is Lisbeth Salander, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" a 2009 Swedish film also starring Michael Nyqvist. The film is based on the first book of the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson.<br/><br/>Nyqvist plays journalist Mikael Blomkvist, a reporter who broke a story about a well-known businessman, was sued for libel, and lost. He knows he was set up, and he has to wait six months for his sentencing. The executives on his newspaper suggest that he lay low for awhile. A paid assignment comes from a member of the powerful Vanger family, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube). Henrik is old and frail, and before he dies, he wants to see if Blomkvist can solve the disappearance of his niece forty years earlier. Blomkvist lives in the guest house of the Vanger mansion and gets to work.<br/><br/>Soon he realizes that he's not alone -- someone -- Lisbeth Salander -- is hacking into his computer and looking into the case as well - not because she has interest in it, but because she's investigating Blomqvist for the security company for which she works, Merrin Security Inc.<br/><br/>Lisbeth is a goth, on probation for a crime we don't learn much about initially. She has been given a new probation officer (called a guardian) who asks for sexual favors in order to grant her money from her account. Despite what she's going through, it doesn't take long for the reporter and the brilliant computer hacker to join forces. They can probably crack the case, but it doesn't seem likely that Blomqvist can ever crack Lisbeth's hard shell. She's a mysterious, pencil-thin, seemingly hard and unemotional woman who won't answer questions about herself.<br/><br/>This is an incredible film that despite its gorgeous cinematography, is very dark, filled with mystery, tension, sexual perversion, murder, monsters, and violence, not to mention a few twists to the story.<br/><br/>Totally absorbing. I have not seen the American version yet, which I understand is also excellent. The performances in this version are marvelous. Somehow Rapace manages to show that Lisa has some vulnerability, and one really roots for her and doesn't blame her for some of her more aggressive actions.<br/><br/>""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" for me was a very raw, intense experience, so I'm not sure I'll see the American version. But I am looking forward to seeing the two subsequent Swedish films from the trilogy. Really excellent, and not recommended for those with a squeamish stomach."

","The girl with the dragon tattoo is by far one of the best films I have seen in years, many years. It felt as if I was watching 2 movies at the same time. Crime detective work with a feel of a documentary all mixed together in such a way that I truly couldn't wait to see what happened next. I found myself playing along, wondering who was the killer, who was the hero and who in the family were the sociopaths.<br/><br/>When the story focused on Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel Craig) at the beginning I felt as if I was watching a true crime thriller in which there was an obvious foe in which this story would revolve around. Very shortly I was enthralled with Lisbeth Salander(Rooney Mara). I suddenly was watching a docudrama that sucked me in even deeper. I couldn't help but feel pure joy when she confronted her foe. I was feeling emotions that I rarely have felt watching a movie. Never before have I felt so emotional for a character, not just feeling sorry and sadness but excitement, happiness, pleasure and surprisingly a massive adrenaline rush. It was pure. It was jealousy. I wanted more.<br/><br/>Once the two ""good guys"" teamed up and the story had thickened even more I got pulled in even more, so much so that I didn't want this movie to end. I cheered, literally cheered out loud when they got together. I felt as if this wasn't just a story being told in a movie by some actors but as if they were real people, living, breathing, real people.<br/><br/>Towards the end when Mikael was caught and taken to the ""pleasure room"" the suspense of it all was truly vicious, so vicious that I was actually sitting on the edge of my seat. That moment when Lisbeth came in I surprised myself by feeling relief, relief that her love, the guy that was going to fix her life and give her back all the things her father stole from her as a girl was safe, safe because of her.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours about this movie and it will definitely will consume hours of my life in the near future when I discuss it with my brother.<br/><br/>Of course however there is one thing that held this movie back from being in the top 3 all time favorite movies of mine. What is it you may wonder and I shall tell you. The End. Yes, the very end of the movie, the last 15 seconds of this movie enraged me, saddened me, just plain broke my heart. I have loved and lost and the pain I felt in the aftermath came back, hit me right in the chest. Even now as I type this I still feel sadness for Lisbeth AND Mikael for they had what few rarely get. TRUE LOVE. The last 15 seconds turned an amazing crime thriller/docudrama into nothing more then a tragedy, as if it was something straight from William Shakespeare himself.<br/><br/>In closing I give this movie a 9 out of 10. It captured me and truly made me feel as if I was a part of this story. It allowed me to feel what I haven't felt in along time, and that folks is what a good movie should do."

","I have not read the book, not seen the theatre version, or seen the remake for dumb audiences that cannot be bothered to read subtitles. I have watched the original Swedish TV mini series in two parts. A good mystery made in laid back, brooding Scandinavian style - a la Wallander (Hendriksson) and 'The Killing.' The thriller aspects are not overdone, so cars do not jump off roads in CGI and endless build ups are avoided. The story of a left wing, crusading journo (Blomqvist) trying to uncover a 40 year old mysterious disappearance of a multi-millionaire magnate's niece is deftly and slowly told against a background of shuttered lives and shuttered doors on an island setting. The interconnection of the journo and a rather psychotic young woman (Salander) works naturally and the unlikely Holmes/Watson combo solve the plot without too many blistering coincidences or plot contrivances. the acting is restrained and good - not too overboard and emotional (as the remake appears to be) - the direction slowly building to a climax, and the script - given the material - not too over cooked. A small problem is the porno-like violence involving Salander, which, while not graphic, seems overdone for the plot and a little tacked on. But have to see the other two films/books to judge whether it is all part of the bigger scenario. Why was a remake really required, except for US dumba**es?"

","Now I haven't seen many Swedish movies. If I have, I can't remember them. I got out this movie from the local video store and I watched it last night. I was quite surprised how well done this movie was. I was captivated by the excellent performances by the Swedish actors, all of whom I've never seen before. Every actor was the exact portrayal of the character in the book. Henrik Vanger, Lisbeth Salander, the evil Nils Bgurman and others. At first, I wasn't convinced by Mikael Blomkvist; but as the movie moved on I gradually got to him him better and was enthralled by his performance.<br/><br/>I didn't know how the movie makers were going to tackle the horrific rape scene or scenes in the book. It was unsettling to watch, but it worked. I nearly had my finger on the fast-forward button but managed to get through the gritty scenes.<br/><br/>I've read Stieg Larsson's book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo about 6 months ago. I loved the book. I thought it would make a great movie but I wouldn't think that a Hollywood blockbuster would do it justice, as this book is obviously set in Sweden. But this movie has done that."
"orion_ss1","9","1","2","28 December 2011"," Far better than the 2011 remake
","The book was great. It took a while as the book ( like the movie ) bounced between Lisbeth's story and Michael's until they merged. While reading I thought the book too bogged in details, but watching the movie I thought too many important details were skimmed over.<br/><br/>I do believe the movie was faithful to the book's plot ( more so than the 2011 remake ). Both developed the characters well, but this movie went deeper into both main characters. The book made a great deal of Blomkvist's jail sentence, and his preparation to go when they called him ( not the same as out on bail awaiting appeal like we do in the US, but I digress ), and when he did go the whole jail aspect merely evaporated ( I do not consider that detail a spoiler, as it was so trivial ). <br/><br/>If you only have time to watch one, I'd recommend this one; the original."
"wadechurton","6","1","2","26 December 2011"," Don't get excited, it's just classic noir elements with a lick of paint.
","After finally catching up with this one, after all the hype and bluster it was something of a letdown. Not a disaster, nor even a complete failure, but it didn't live up to the claims of excellence. 'TGWTDT', for all its computer-hacking punky female lead and squirm-worthy scenes of sado-masochism, is a firm-handed throwback to the film noir 1940s. You've seen this sort of story before; detective gets hired for an unusual case, hooks up with a spunky can-do girl assistant and both put their lives in danger when they discover more than they bargained for. The movie goes on for around thirty minutes too long, there are a couple of painfully glaring plot holes (we're asked to believe that an expert computer hacker can't arrange an alternative bank account for herself, for example) and the evil social-worker sub-plot was pretty much as unnecessary as it was unpleasant. Most crucially, it was just a little too hard to empathise with Lisbeth, which would have helped immensely, but as a character she remained too 'distant'. Whilst the acting was merely okay, it was the unfolding of the movie's old-fashioned hard-boiled thriller plot which commanded the attention, and the direction was well up to par although there could have been more 'tautness' to the whole. A mixed bag, but one to be enjoyed (bar the 'social worker' subplot) as basically a homage (intentionally or not) to classic film noir."
"ajs-10","8","1","2","18 October 2011"," Riveting thriller from the pen of Stieg Larsson with a truly memorable performance from Noomi Rapace
","Based of the first novel of the 'Millennium Trilogy' by Stieg Larsson, this Swedish film adaptation is (IMO) quite excellent. I should make it clear that I watched the extended edition which runs for just short of three hours. Also, being a bit of a purist, I watched it with subtitles, although there is the option of a dubbed version for those not quite so brave. I was quite surprised just how enthralling it was and, having never read the novels, just what a well written drama it turned out to be. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist is the editor of a magazine, 'Millennium', that has accused businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström of some wrongdoing. The case went to court and Blomkvist lost. He has just three months before he has to go to jail for six months. Unbeknownst to him, he has been investigated himself by a professional hacker, Lisbeth Salander, who works for a security firm. The reason becomes clear when Blomkvist is hired by wealthy businessman, Henrik Vanger, to investigate the disappearance of his niece more than forty years ago. Moving out to the remote island where the Vanger family all live, in separate houses, Blomkvist is soon embroiled in the case. Little does he know though, but Lisbeth Salander is still keeping tabs on him and when she sends him the answer to a vital clue the unlikely pair end up joining forces in order to solve the case. There is an awful lot more to tell but I dare not say it or the Spoiler Police might find a way to make me disappear.<br/><br/>A very well made film with an almost washed-out look to the visuals which always makes me think of northern climes. I also thought the music by Jacob Groth was excellent and fitting the, at times, haunting piece very well. As for performances, well, both Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander were outstanding particularly Noomi Rapace. Also worthy of note were; Lena Endre as Erika Berger, Sven-Bertil Taube as Henrik Vanger, Peter Haber as Martin Vanger, Peter Andersson as Nils Bjurman, Marika Lagercrantz as Cecilia Vanger, Ingvar Hirdwall as Dirch Frode and Björn Granath as Gustav Morell.<br/><br/>On the DVD the film is split into two parts, each of about ninety minutes. This, I found, made it feel a little bit like a TV adaptation rather than a cinema release. Don't get me wrong, all the production values of a big cinema release are there, but I did, at times, feel like I was watching a major two-parter on HBO (or Sky Atlantic for us Brits), albeit in Swedish. Despite this, I still very much enjoyed this mystery thriller and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the other two parts of the set. Maybe I'll have to watch a couple of things in English in between too much Swedish at once can really get taxing. Over all though, totally engrossing with some truly excellent performances Highly recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.2/10 IMDb Score: 7.7/10 (based on 48,699 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 86/100 (based on 165 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a very good film. It had fantastic performances, a very engaging storyline, and some great cinematography. I expected it to be more obscure in the way foreign films are. For example, a foreign film like Let The Right One In certainly has a distinct style from an American film despite its subtitles. This doesn't. It actually has the look, mood, and feel of a film that could have been made here in America (by ignoring the subtitles part)... which is why I wonder why Fincher decided to remake this. I'm sure the material interests him but unlike Let The Right One In, this doesn't feel too un-mainstream for the general public. In fact, if one was to disregard that it has subtitles I would actually think it was made here. It was a very good film, but I I don't know how Fincher can expand or differentiate his film with this. That means I hope he does different things with it. Let Me In might have had like the same storyline and the same dialogue many times but it certainly had a distinctive tone and atmosphere that applied to itself only."

","I remember the days when I used to date a few girls with dragon tattoos. It marked me as a guy that liked Gothic chicks, or something like that. I thought that was unfair stereotypical criticism not only to me but for the young ladies. OK, this never happened (well, maybe a couple of times it did). I was just trying to be a guy with a ""girl with a dragon tattoo"" story, but obviously that intro did not make its mark. Anyways, most have heard of this foreign flick adapted from the late Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel about Mikael Blomkvist, a Stockholm disgraced reporter who is employed by Henrik Vanger, a geriatric Swedish millionaire in order to unravel the mystery of who killed Vanger's beloved niece Harriet. Vanger offers Blomkvist a wealthy fee for his services, the only catch is that the murder occurred 40 years ago and it is not fresh blood anymore (ouch, I hit below the belt on that one, must have been the dragon inside of me), and another catch is that Henrik requests for Mikael to investigate some of the family members of his own Vanger clan. I guess Henrik is of the ""school of thinking"" that a family who is rich together also kills together. However, where this movie gets profoundly skin deep is in the character of Lisbeth Salander, a gothicetta computer hacker who has been able to hack away on Blomkvist's CPU for sometime and eventually ends up teaming with Mikael to investigate the Vanger cold case. Salander is witty, crafty, sexy, sly, sharp, and also has one big ass tattoo on her back. I thought that Director Niels Arden Opley's film adaptation of Larsson's masterpiece literary offering was more than OK but not perfect, but then again Opley could just do so much in incorporating all the intrinsic details from the book to the movie. Screenwriters Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg probably knew that they were playing with fire in adapting a Larsson book to a movie screenplay, but they actually excelled with a well-knitted movie scribe. I must report that there was no libel in Michael Nyqvist's suave performance as Blomkvist, but it was Noomi Rapace's multi-layered thespian effort in her Lisbeth portrayal what fired me up the most about ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". Noomi is looming as a major actress! I have yet to see the film's sequels ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" (not based on all the girls who have dated me) or ""The Girls Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" (not based on all the girls who have kicked me where it hurts the most), but I doubt those films can reach the achievement of its praise-worthy predecessor. **** Good"

","Perhaps it is the current need to see that evil eventually consumes itself that make films like THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (AKA ""Män som hatar kvinnor"") so successful. Or it may be the posthumous fame given Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy (from which this film is 'Millennium: Part 1 - Men Who Hate Women') that has prepared an audience of believers. Whatever the reason this first installment (the other two installments have already been filmed and are ready for release) is being hailed as an epic masterpiece, a film that will go down in cinematic history as a classic. And for that reason you may want to see this current long exploration of the evil of man. But is it a masterpiece.....? <br/><br/>Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg adapted this book for the screen and the script is interpreted by director Niels Arden Oplev who has cast the many characters of the story with some excellent Swedish actors. By the end of this multi-twisted tale we are left satisfied with the balance of good over evil - or are we? After all we're only part way there and, as in the BOURNE SERIES in this country, subsequent parts to the story become only more bizarre - and exciting. At any rate, the story in brief deals with an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) whose apparent loss of a case of libel against a wealthy corrupt corporate group results in his being chosen by an elderly but mentally vigorous gentleman Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate a long buried case of the apparent murder of his niece -a deed Vanger is convinced is associated with his disgustingly morally corrupt family. Blomkvist is fascinated and begins his tedious examination of film and facts that seem to add clues as to the mystery surrounding Harriet Vanger's disappearance. Enter a punk rock appearing, pierced and tattooed young girl Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Repace) who ends up assisting Blomkvist in solving the conundrum. After some rather confusing bits of replay of Lisbeth's past and the revelation of her current situation with a guardian assigned to control her after her recent discharge from an institution, we are allowed to watch the discovery of 40 years of serial killings of young girls: the fact that they are all Jewish and that Vanger's family contains a number of ex-Nazis boils the pot. Much gore, visual exposure to violence and the results of violence flood the screen as the eventual discovery of the true history of Harriet Vanger is uncovered. <br/><br/>The film is two and a half hours long but seems much shorter because of the rapid fire sequencing by the director. Much praise has been heaped on Noomi Repace as Lisbeth and while she performs well, and looks bizarre, one wonders why all the hoopla. This is a good film of its kind, very well transforming a book into cinematic excess, and for those who crave gore and acts of depravity it will probably please. For film goers who prefer thinking to raw action this may not be the choice of a film du jour. In Swedish with subtitles and with English dubbing. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

It doesn't seem to care whether or not the audience can or will relate to the two protagonists, neither exactly bursting with charisma, charm or even presence and even without the body piercings the female lead would be hard to fancy unless you'd been on an uninhabited island for a quarter of a century. Not that either is a bad actor, indeed the whole cast is well up to snuff with at least one - Sven-Bertil Taube - being familiar via his films with Bergman. The mystery isn't really much of a mystery and anyone reasonably au fait with the genre will be one jump ahead of the two sleuths from the third or fourth reel.

However, the darkness in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is suffocating rather then compelling and originality or vibrancy, that I thought this film may produce (having no concept of the story), and based on its huge literary success was non-existent. Dan Brown's adaptations (Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons) although a poor relation to his page-turning books had stimuli, something of consequence. In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo you are joining a murder investigation which has been unsuccessful for over thirty years, and of little relevancy apart to an ensconced and broken family. Furthermore, the private investigator discovers clues that any astute and professional police investigator should of deduced.<br/><br/>The main plot, driven by excellent performances from the two leads never gets in gear. The main protagonist's unclear past and eccentric behaviour does not excel the film in any character driven manner, and their attempt to make this film a character study come murder mystery falls flat. The screenwriters try to bring in a couple of subplots but these are barely introduced before they are just as quickly concluded.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a cumbersome and idle affair with the story essentially not evolving at any satisfactory level.

Naturally beginning here, he's less spectacular but much more real. The plot, based in the same novel, has it's natural similarities, though they can still be found pretty different, especially the second half. Easier to follow, solid and consistent. It's also understandable that the American let himself float around Blomfvist's personal life, compromising the main point of the argument. On the other hand, 2011 version has a great scenery. The Winter is astonishingly well generated and Lisbeth has an awesome character, perhaps leading Mara to an Oscar. Noomi Rapace kills as Lisbeth Salander. Doesn't have half the image and style of Rooney Mara but achieves equal level excellence. I won't say the same about Michael Nyqvist, as Blomkvist, who was visibly overpast by Daniel Craig.

It only occurred to me once I started reading Stieg Larsson's subsequent novel that a key 'twist' or piece of information that he keeps hidden from the reader until the final third of the book was already blatantly obvious to me. As a result of this, I couldn't help but feel slightly robbed of the chance of being sucked into the story, and any hope of resolving this twist on my own accord.<br/><br/>This movie does not explicitly spell out what is to happen in the second story, but if anyone has even a limited experience in cinema, or even a basic understanding of storytelling, then you will most likely come to the conclusion that I made (while watching this movie), and be thoroughly upset when you already know one of the 'secret' moments in the second novel.<br/><br/>Based on my experience, I would recommend reading ALL the novels before one sees any of the movies.<br/><br/>Of course, if reading the books is not in your plan, then go ahead and see the movies - they are great!"
"brandypants85","9","1","3","2 February 2011"," Fabulous Movie - But not exactly in sync with the book...
","I have seen the Stieg Larsson novels on the shelves of American bookstores for the past several years, and I wasn't really that interested in the beginning because I thought it was more of a ""detective fiction"" type book... and, although an avid reader, I'm not a big fan of crime fiction. Alternately, as a foreign movie ADDICT, I will watch pretty much anything because I enjoy analyzing the differences in non-American films. My friend mentioned it to me, but cautioned me that it was very hard in some places to watch (I'm sure you know the scene). Finally, I couldn't keep myself away any more and decided to watch it.<br/><br/>I was blown away. I never imagined that this movie would be so profound, so emotionally enthralling. The movie is so gripping that I found myself actually experiencing a level of emotional involvement that surprised myself. The perplexing storyline draws the viewer into feeling similarly desperate that the mystery must be solved, and keeps you on the edge of your seat with curiosity as things become more and more twisted. I also enjoyed the development of individual characters that influences the way they are in their every day operational thought and motivation. <br/><br/>After watching the movie, I finally decided I wanted to read the book. I'm not sure exactly why, since I already knew what happens... Perhaps I thought it may go into further detail, or perhaps now that I've finished the book - it was so moving I can't even remember what motivated me to watch it in the first place. Although I still absolutely love the movie, and have no regrets about watching it first (I doubt I would have found it as enjoyable if I had already read the book). After finishing the book, and reflecting on the similarities and differences, I was a little disappointed that there were differences that I thought were so important in the book. I assume since the movie was two and a half hours long, this was probably to avoid a running time of over three hours. I didn't care for the fact that certain characters that I believed to be pivotal were completely left out in the movie, and I also thought that some things were changed that were completely unnecessary - such as the way in which Wennerstrom was eliminated in the end, and the relationships between Lisbeth and her Mother, and Blomkvist and Erika. <br/><br/>The biggest disappointment in all (but again, I must stress the fact that I am still VERY fond of the movie), is the way that Lisbeth is portrayed. In the book, she is such a heroine. Her emotional actions and personality are portrayed quite a bit differently in the movie, and I wish they would not have downplayed the relationship between her and Blomkvist so much. I thought that the pull in her between the hardened girl with the disturbed past, and the vulnerable woman who just wants to be loved... created a way in which I feel any woman could relate to her - and I feel this made her even more a heroine.<br/><br/>Lastly, I wish she would have worn the t-shirt that says ""Armageddon was yesterday - today we have a serious problem."" in the movie!!!"

","The film has gained its popularity since its domestic run in Sweden, adapted from the first book of Millennium Trilogy (the rest two, The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest were all released in 2009). <br/><br/>As a crime thriller, the film's global success lies in its well-arranged hackling of all the clues and releases them slickly (a little bit predictable as well), however the main attribution is to introduce a new star Noomi Rapace into Hollywood, her appearance and performance are so coherent with the character, which I can hardly sense she is acting. Millennium Trilogy is Noomi's stepping stone to success, next year we will see her in the new Sherlock Homes film along with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. <br/><br/>As a punk-look hacker, our heroin shows sheer feminism, the highlight arrives when she is inserting a dildo into the pervert's anus and tattoos him later. Actually the revenge is not men-offending, on the contrary, it gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the callous vengeance finally fulfilled. <br/><br/>I am very much stroke by the murder cases here (especially a frigid location of Sweden), it seems that the cruelness and coldness of the nature surrounding is overspreading inside people as well, as for me, posing the excuse of the brutal crimes on the flimsy religious and sexual grounds is too unrealistic. <br/><br/>The cinematography is another merit, at times I saw the snow scene against a mesmerizing sea-blue sky set off by the haunting score. I hear rumor says that the second and third feature is not as good as this one, I find it is a perfect ending I just stop here and wait for David Fincher's remake coming out next year, which certainly I am more interested."

","The Novelist Stieg Larsson died in 2004, where none of his ""Millennium"" trilogy has been published yet. There was a tragic story that I found behind the making of those books. When Larsson was 15 years old, he witnessed the gang rape of a young girl. He never forgave himself for failing to help that poor girl at that time. The girl name was Lisbeth. Thiz movie is the first adaptation of those trilogy books. Sometimes I find myself enjoying so much pleasure by watching European movies like thiz Scandinavian movie. The movie is filled with splendid cinematography. I have ever thought that High Definition (HD) Camera would not be able to accomplish thiz kind of remarkable views. I was wrong, many nowadays Directors are still able to create a great nuance with precise treatment through their HD Cameras, sometimes even better. The movie is directed by Niels Arden Oplev. The story tells about the troubled journalist Mikael Blomkvist has to work side by side with a genius punk Gothic hacker, Lisbeth Salander in order to solve a mystery about a missing young girl named Harriet, for the event that had occurred 40 years ago, upon the request of a billionaire industrialist, Henrik Vanger. I have to mention that Sven-Bertil Taube has made a solid performance as Henrik Vanger. Michael Niqvist is very convincing to create his dual side character as Mikael Blomkvist. And surely, the most memorable performance belongs to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander. I realize that those characters are so difficult to play especially for the two main characters, Blomkvist and Salander because of their complicated motives and backgrounds. I simply called thiz movie as classic thriller with modern contents. Classic which makes us pays attention to clue by clue to get closer to the hidden villain. It is what classic thrillers do. Modern which floods with audacious elements such as the anti-hero characters, ironical sexual abuse scene, unusual moral conflict and many more. I heard that next year, they will remake thiz movie into Hollywood version. My opinion is don't expect too much, even though the Director will be David Fincher who is capable to translate dark tone into intriguing crime thrillers like thiz, he had already proved that through ""se7en"" (1995), ""Fight Club"" (1999) and ""The Zodiac"" (2005). The newest James Bond, Daniel Craig will be the main figure as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara (""The Social Network"" {2010}) will be played as Lisbeth. I think no matter how hard they will try. Thiz Swedish movie has already set up the bar so high and seems undefeated at thiz time.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

","The Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is so good that it presents a serious challenge to the forthcoming American remake. It's difficult to imagine that Rooney Mara (whom I've never seen in anything) can compare with Noomi Rapace as the damaged, violent, brilliant computer hacker who is as much at the center of the movie as the lead male, Michael Nyqvist (playing Mikael Blomkvist, the temporarily disgraced journalist employed to determine what happened many years previously to the young niece of a wealthy industrialist),<br/><br/>It will also be interesting to see how Hollywood handles the violent and explicit sex scenes that go much beyond anything Hollywood has shown as well as the gore that is as savage as any I've seen in a film not about the Holocaust. Don't wait for the American film to see the Swedish version. It's exceptional.<br/><br/>Having seen the American version, I can now say that the Swedish version is much better, largely due to the performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth. However, Mikael Blomkvist is also better than Daniel Craig. There is nothing remotely Swedish about Craig -- and this is a story which takes place in Sweden. As to the sex scenes, they are not QUITE as violent and explicit as in the Swedish film, but they come close enough. However, the American film has another serious defect. It simplifies the complicated plot of the novel and, in doing so, makes some things obscure that are perfectly clear in the Swedish film. I regard that as a loss.<br/><br/>I wonder the other two films in the trilogy will also be duplicated in the U.S. and, if so, how close they will come to Stieg Larsson's achievement."

","Watched this film last night on British pay to view. I was initially put off by its length, however I felt the story was strong, acted well and the differing characters were contrasted superbly. The subtext of ""don't be surprised about what goes on behind closed doors"" and I think a look into some of the more unsavoury aspects of Sweden's past was another insightful subtext.<br/><br/>It certainly wouldn't be screened by the Swedish tourist board and only reflects on a small aspect of the community.<br/><br/>A brave non conventional thriller, no real hero, all characters flawed to a degree, and I think an almost predictable ending, however a good watch!"

The actress who plays Lisbeth,Noomi Rapace, adds a dark and Captavating feel to her,already interesting,character. <br/><br/>At times this film is pretty unsettling and hard to watch so I wouldn't recommend this for people who get easily unsettled; however,I would strongly recommend this because it is incredibly captivating. <br/><br/>At 2 and a half hours this film is never boring and will have you glued watching it especially during the climax.This film is certainly a must see and is an excellent crime thriller."
"Leasey","4","1","4","25 December 2011"," Disappointing.
","I must say I'm somewhat surprised at the high ratings being dished out for the 2009 version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo... especially from those who have read the book.<br/><br/>My curiosity was sparked having seen the trailer for the 2011 film. I read the book first and tore through it in one sitting - loved it. Did the same with the second book a couple of days later - also awesome. The 2011 movie is not on general release yet, so I decided to watch the original Swedish version in the meantime - and I can't help feeling let down.<br/><br/>I think the reason for this is that so many little bits of the book that really caught my imagination were either just totally left out of the film, or skirted over quickly - The mystery of who was in the window; the mass search of the confined island; the old police officer telling Blomqvist the story of the murder in Hedestadt decades earlier to Harriet's disappearance; then suddenly realising they were connected an the subsequent investigation with all its gory details. <br/><br/>I found the pace and sequencing of this film to be really hard going. One one hand I found it to be very slow, but on the other hand I found it very frustrating that not enough time was really given to explaining what was going on! It was like they tried to include a great deal of content, but completely failed to flesh it out - lurching incomprehensibly but slowly from one plot hole to the next. I'm not sure if I was just zoning out because I was bored, but I found myself wondering how anyone could follow this film if they had not read the book. <br/><br/>I realise that when adapting books to film certain things need to be either marginalised or even left out due to time constraints - but at two and a half hours long the makers could have done better with what they did choose to include. <br/><br/>The acting was OK - nothing amazing. If I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have thought Lisbeth was that much of an interesting character. Some of the photography I thought was excellent. A lot has been said about the 'gritty and brutal' sex/rape scenes, but to be honest I personally did not find them to be as traumatic as many peoples reactions have made them out to be (not suggesting rape isn't traumatic - I've just seen dramas that have contained far more graphic content). <br/><br/>I didn't learn it until after I saw it, but the Swedish 2009 version was originally intended to be the first 2 episodes of a 6-part TV series (a number of other reviews seem upset that events that occur in the first 45mins do not have much to do with the main plot - however it is worth bearing in mind that this film is only the first third of the story). <br/><br/>I anticipate the 2011 version will be by far a more superior film."
"cag_cag","5","1","4","22 December 2011"," Could of done better.
","I watched this film after reading the book. I think the script could be a lot better. The boring period up to the biblical discovery could have been better emphasised. The cold barren landscape of the Swedish winter and the enclosed solitude this creates. It is an alien environment more should of been made of this. It creates the general atmosphere. Mikael's daughters relevation replaced by Lisbeths was wrong. The film should of taken off at this moment and included Lisbeths past at this point. This would of accentuated the hideous crimes better. Lisbeths character could of entered n a more acute manner highlighting the similarity between the alienation of one side and the other. Mikael and Lisbeth, winter and spring, Nazi and the abused etc. after all Lisbeth does bare a resemblance. In the book Lisbeth sleeps with Mikael because he is different from her previous experiences. The film ignores this important distinction and drifts more towards a Hollywood film. The parts that are not in the book suggests to me that Lisbeth is not that far removed form the culprits. I know that there is a lot to cram into a film but I expected more from a Swedish film. However, quite a lot is there the pro Feminist, the Anti Nazi, Gays and the Anti Capitalist etc."

","It's hard to put into words how these movies make you feel. I just finished watching the third one and my life is pretty much changed. If you get the chance, please PLEASE watch these movies. I could not stop thinking about this movie the entire day after I saw it. I just kept wanting more. Then I came to this wonderful website (GO IMDb!) and found out that the director, in all of his wonder and glory, made all three movies in the same year! Bravo, bravo good sir.<br/><br/>So if you want a trilogy that is completely and effortlessly unique, that will keep you strapped to your seat or whatever it is you're sitting on, and that will take you for the most intense cinematic roller-coaster I personally have ever experienced.. go watch them. Like now.<br/><br/>P.S. I also noticed that we, the great United States, are going to re-make these films in 2011. I find this absolutely outrageous! There is NO way they can top these films. Take it from a film student and seasoned movie watcher, these films are masterpieces that stand on their own.. it would be wrong to try to make them into blockbusters for $$$. Just wrong.<br/><br/>And if you still don't believe me, take ""Let Me In"" for example, the new Americanized re-make of a perfectly good Swedish? film ""Let the Right One In"". The Swedes sure know their stuff because that film was the single greatest vampire film I've ever seen hands down. It's beautifully simple and intensely thrilling. I refuse to watch our version because it isn't even a movie made about the original Swedish book, its a re-make of the movie! So unnecessary! I fear that the same thing will happen with this little gem, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo."
"ruthnoakes","7","1","4","10 September 2010"," You think Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is just hype?
","I deliberately resisted reading the whole book before watching; I read enough chapters to love the book, but avoid clouding my judgement of the film. I was hoping for another Swedish gem, something I could enjoy as much as I loved Let The Right One In (not the remake).<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (""Män som hatar kvinnor""), was directed by Niels Arden Oplev and based on Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy. I loved the story telling within the film, the tale itself is irresistible, as is the heroine Lisbeth Salander (played by Noomi Rapace). But again that is mainly credit to the book, not necessarily the filmmakers.<br/><br/>I admit the film was atmospheric, held my attention, and the story seduced me. But some chunks of the tale felt like they were included only to appease the book's fans. For example, we probably didn't need such routine intervals of Lisbeth's past. Her past is vital of course, it grants context, but so much of it added nothing to the plot, and felt like it was there just to break the pacing between sub-plot and main-plot.<br/><br/>We could have instead been teased with briefer hints and flashes to her past. But I suppose they wanted to find a balance between her tortured past and tortured present. It felt too prescribed, too calculative, trying too hard to force us to see everything of what she is, rather than letting us interpret. I suppose I found it mildly patronising.<br/><br/>I was not offended by the more graphic scenes, which I won't reveal as I don't like spoilers. I actually liked the fact that she was portrayed as a strong, independent female. Her dynamic with the journalist Mikael Blomkvist (played by Michael Nyqvist) was effective, and there wasn't anything startling wrong with the film. It just wasn't everything I had hoped for.<br/><br/>I should refer back to the film I mentioned before. Hoyte Van Hoytema was responsible for the cinematography in Let the Right One In, his style is subtle but irresistible. Whereas The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, despite not being poorly filmed, certainly had no distinctive style or anything visually new to offer.<br/><br/>I think the girl With the Dragon Tattoo is living proof that the books are always better than the film. But I am glad they made it into a film, because it means more people are encouraged to read the books, which I have found to be excellent. I would recommend watching this film, but don't do so if you're expecting something groundbreaking or revolutionary."
"Robert_duder","8","1","4","25 August 2010"," A dark twisted mystery that mystery lovers will draw to
","You can't make ten steps without seeing something about The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy. Recently (before seeing the film) I tried to start the first novel but found it oddly difficult to get through so I watched the film. The movie is everything that I've heard people say about the series. A dark twisted thriller on an isolated island and an eccentric family with a very dark secret. I have to imagine that this film does its very best to keep true to the source material which can be a challenge when translating a very popular book such as this. The film has the exact pace of a Television series. When I say this I mean that it reminds me of watching a great episode of a superb detective story...something like Columbo, or Father Dowling of the 80's. Obviously the film is much darker than any TV show could possibly be. The violence, gratuitous nudity, rape scenes and general foreboding setting is dark enough to make this a definite adult thriller. The chemistry between the characters, who are complete opposites of each other, is really excellent making them the perfect duo to solve the mystery.<br/><br/>I certainly can't speak to any previous performances of the actors given they are Swedish. Michael Nyqvist plays reporter Mikael Blomkvist to near perfection. Sometimes an actor embodies his character to the point of becoming that character and I believe Nygvist does exactly that. I can't imagine anyone doing this role (even Daniel Craig.) He is perfect. Noomi Rapace is no different as the girl with the dragon tattoo Lisbeth Salander. She embodies the role and draws you into her twisted, emotionally disturbed character with a powerful ability that enhances her abilities to be a detective. Her character goes through a lot of changes throughout but she does it with such character and chemistry on screen. Nygvist and Rapace both as actors and their characters couldn't be more different and yet they have this amazing chemistry as partners. Lena Endre seems to play what is supposed to be a main character as Nygvist's lover and also his co-worker but honestly she is barely a supporting character. There is no depth or real reason for her to be there. However I feel like the same could be said for almost all the other supporting characters. Peter Haber, Sven-Bertil Taube, Marika Lagercrantz and Ewa Fröling while good don't really stand out amongst the powerful story and the powerful performances of the two leads. Taube is probably the best of the supporters but he doesn't get enough screen time to truly make it effective.<br/><br/>I think its a real shame to not have director Niels Arden Oplev helm the American version of the film. He clearly has an incredible grasp of Stieg Larsson original novel. I know this because every word I heard someone ever say about the novel is precisely what the film showed me. I can't emphasize enough that this is a very dark film, there is no happy ending and this film clearly sets up the future of the trilogy. Lovers of mysteries or thrillers who are looking for something off the beaten path then you will love every minute of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Its almost too complex for its own good. My only wish is that perhaps they would have linked together the clues a little better. I mean, ultimately (in my opinion) Blomkvist and Salander never truly uncover any major clue that leads them to the killer but rather happen upon a string of lucky happenings. You can't get away from the effect this story has had on recent pop culture and if they do it right and stay true to the story the American version will be well worth seeing although it will never be as gritty as this, the original film to the book. 8/10"
"ruby_fff","8","1","4","12 August 2010"," A whodunit by its own right, cognitive solutions and resourceful set-up for its next two trilogy companion films
","""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" introduced us to Lisbeth Salander, the heroine focused in Swedish author Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy. It is said that Larsson was impressed by childhood heroine ""Pippi Longstocking"" (from the pen of Swedish children's author Astrid Lindgren) who is known to be a brave, independent girl with exceptional stamina and courage. So Lisbeth's character was modeled after Pippi, in a way. A modern Pippi, Lisbeth sure is: fearless, intelligent, uninhibited, and very much in control of herself at the prime age of 24, a loner with a mysterious background.<br/><br/>This whodunit is without the involvement of police-detective or inspector (so it's not quite like Poirot or Sherlock Holmes) - we are following two consummate investigative brains, one is that of the ever-revolving, daring Lisbeth Salander's, the other is Millennium journalist Mikael Blomkvist's which is just as bold if not reservedly so. Hence the cognitive, methodical unraveling of the Vander family mystery at hand that Blomkvist was given, by fate if you will, linked up with Salander (reluctantly or not) - together they're on the trail to decode a 'forty year old' murderous secret. The nature of the investigation somehow was very close to Lisbeth's heart and being. The original Swedish title ""Men Who Hate Women"" might provide inklings to the topic, then again, is that all there is? Danish director Niels Arden Oplev elegantly delivered the characters and storyline without over-the-top gratuitous action, chase, or gore. Yes, there are certain scenes that are 'unapologetically' frank, physical, sexual or otherwise - but they were crucial to the core of the story and the decoding process of the dark history in stored for our protagonists. (It may not be as grand as the Vatican exposure in ""Angels and Demons"", but the suggestion of the Third Reich connection is no small matter, either.)<br/><br/>It's been 4 months 12 days since I last saw ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and the detail deductions, investigative discovery steps by the two leads were still vivid in my mind when I recall the film. That's kudos to the impressive portrayals of Lisbeth by Noomi Rapace and Blomkvist by Michael Nyqvist. Together they have played off each other, one fiery and one more reticent, one more venturous and the other cautious, under the thoughtful direction from Oplev, and thanks to a competent production crew of two screenwriters, cinematographer, two editors, composer, production, costume and sound designers, makeup, and talented supporting cast, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is an entertaining suspenseful thriller, even when you have to read the subtitles, the tension and high drama, you will appreciate, from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Whether you'll see all three films in the ""Millennium"" trilogy or not, this first installment is worthy of your time if you like movies."

You see, what this reviewer needs to know, he gets the information from the movies he watches. The attack on Pearl Harbour? Were Kate Beckinsale, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett somewhere dodging the bombs set off by Michael Bay? Oskar Schindler? The 1976 Tangshan earthquake? Was Feng Xiaogang somewhere making people cry with his weep a minute story? So when this reviewer hears his more intellectual friends talking about the Millennium Trilogy, he has no idea what this was about until some kind film distributor brought this movie adaptation to Singapore.<br/><br/>Based on an award winning crime novel by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson, this movie version tells the riveting story of a journalist who is employed to search for a woman has been missing for 40 years. He is assisted by the titular character, a girl with a dragon tattoo, who is a computer hacker.<br/><br/>The short synopsis sums up the 152 minute movie in a few sentences. If you have read the novel, you'd know there are a lot more details that have been left out. That is intentional because, if like this reviewer, you are one who doesn't read (you should, really – there's nothing to be proud of when you go around telling people that you don't read), the greatness of this movie is sitting through it and discovering the details bit by bit – yes, all two and a half hours of it.<br/><br/>Director Niels Arden Oplev manages to captivate his audiences with this movie like how he would with a well written novel. Minute by minute, he makes you pay attention to the plot development and character evolution like how you would flip through a book page by page. You anticipate the unfolding of the story plot like how you refuse to put down a book, because you want to find out what happens in the next chapter. Before you know it, you have finished the book, oops, we mean, movie, satisfied with the journey you have just taken with the characters.<br/><br/>The casting of the two main leads is spot on too. Michael Nyqvist plays the journalist who is determined to uncover a mystery that has spanned a few generations. The actor's credible performance makes you go on this dangerous, perilous and almost fatal ride with him. There are occasions you feel his fatigue, but the power to carry on engages you. Even more commanding on screen is Noomi Rapace who plays the girl with the dragon tattoo. Her mesmerizing and compelling presence is a gem, given the uncountable sweet young things out there trying to make it big. The role requires her to go through some torturous moments, and the graphic violence may just make you squirm in your seat.<br/><br/>And why are we not surprised that Hollywood is going to have its own version of this Swedish movie? With Daniel Craig signing on for the role played by Nyqvist and the crucial role of the computer hacker still unknown, we can only wait with abated breath how our American friends will fare with David Fincher helming the production as director. Meanwhile, we shall await some kind distributor to bring in the second and third installments of Larsson's trilogy, The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. If they are as fascinatingly well made as this movie, then this reviewer be better off watching the movies rather than, ahem, visiting a library to pick up the books."

","I must admit that I never watched any Swedish films before and this one was a novelty thing, if I may say so. t first, I was a bit skeptical and sour about that, but then this slow, growing film got me in and made me thrilled. Outstanding work, great plot, mesmerizing slow tempo which is a big plus. Marvelous severe Swedish nature. And then, Blomqvist and Rapace as two main heroes. I must say, they both play great. Very convincing and very thrilling. The plot is a bit predictable, especially, when we were given some hint about Nazi connections, but then, it still rocks good! There are some drawbacks, of course. Some nudity, graphic violence and rape scenes are not appealing at all, and deeply disturbing, and I am awfully sorry, but the view of hairy armpits of Lisbeth does not add to the pleasure of watching. Anyway, minor goofs and violent details did not spoil the general big picture."

","A journalist is hired by a rich man to investigate the disappearance 40 years earlier of his niece. This Swedish film of the first entry in the phenomenally successful ""Millenium"" trilogy of Larsson is entertaining in spite of uninspired casting, undeveloped characters, and a clichéd plot. Nyqvist is too bland of an actor to play the leading role while Rapace is just weird in the title role. The plot is contrived and far-fetched. Apparently, in Sweden everything is documented and readily accessible by the public, including expense reports of private citizens. Extraneous subplots (libel suit, Lisabeth's guardian) detract from the main story line and make the film overlong."

","Translations of books to movies that have satisfied my imagination are practically non-existent. Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park may be an exception. OK, I know this is not a Hollywood adaptation, but still, Stieg Larsson must be turning in his grave. He spent some 500 pages to develop high level detail of characters and a complex intertwined plot, only to have it butchered in on screen. Yes, I've read the book, and that may be the source of my disappointment. But I fail to see how such obvious key elements are missing. Blomkvists' motivation for taking the job in the first place....the suggestion that it was purely for money goes against the actual personality of that character. I am yet to see the Daniel Craig version and sincerely hope that it has been more respectful to the author's original brilliant and captivating story. The film itself is technically OK in terms of cinema...well acted, well shot, but the story is a fraction of its former self.<br/><br/>UPDATE: OK, I have now seen the Daniel Craig version. Do yourself a favour and watch it, rather than the original."
"tombrookes2007","9","1","6","8 September 2010"," Violence in a Volvo - Sado-fueled Swedish Crime Thriller
","Firstly, 'The Girl With' film is very good indeed. Having read the 'Millennium' trilogy of the award winning, best-selling books by the late Stieg Larsson, it is difficult not to compare the two mediums. The point to realize is that the films are solid enough to represent and serve justice to the books, in combining ways, being impressive in their own right.<br/><br/>The films pleasingly stick to its Swedish routes, being shot in Sweden and also in Swedish (with optional English Dub versions that are also good). It also remains low budget in feel, being dark and full of tension and with moments of suspense and shocking content (i.e the several rapes/sex scenes). There is a Hollywood adaptation being planned, with Daniel Craig being confirmed as the lead, and this I feel is a real shame, as it will undoubtedly lose some of it's integrity.<br/><br/>The book's original title was 'Men Who Hate Women', which really is the theme and underlying subject matter fueling this excellent modern crime drama thriller. This inclusion and obsession of violence against women in contemporary Swedish society, addresses psychological issues of crimes and how people's backgrounds can ultimately affect them later in life. <br/><br/>It is great that the stories will reach a bigger audience base but it is a bit of a shame that many will miss out on reading such quality novels. To stop myself comparing the two I would say most thriller and drama film fans will enjoy both of the 'Girl' films, probably finding them more shocking, impressive and scary than the avid book fans. <br/><br/>My only criticisms are that some scenes are rushed, such as the super speedy and ridiculous computer hacking, evidence and research processing and many of the other characters are simply visited briefly and with no depth. But, in all fairness a film that is over 2 hours does well to cover a 538 page book with 30+ chapters!<br/><br/>Comparing the film to the Book; <br/><br/>The film is a straight copy of it's 2005 published book, and having read the book first I noticed these ten main differences, changes and cuts:<br/><br/>1.Mikael Blomkvist's affair with Erika Berger was cut out (although there is a miss-able mention of him having found a woman, just a woman who was already married)<br/><br/>2.When Blomkvist reviews records of the Parade there is now a video clip, as well as just photographs. <br/><br/>3.I do not remember any attack on Lisbeth Salander, in the tube station. She is also colder, more petite and harsher than some readers will have imagined. Does this make her less likable? Or is this the point of film 2? <br/><br/>4.Blomkvist has flashbacks of babysitting by the missing girl<br/><br/>5.Lisbeth sports a huge tattoo on her back, as well as one on her leg, the book's front cover shows her with a small dragon on her shoulder.<br/><br/>6.Blomkvist also does not have sexual relations with suspect Cecilia Vagner. <br/><br/>7.The sex scenes are changed slightly in detail. <br/><br/>8.The dungeon and small village is different in appearance. <br/><br/>9.Lisbeth also has flashbacks, these are not in the book but do add to the film and explaining her character's troubled past. <br/><br/>10.Blomkvist works solely from his new cabin home, not venturing into the local town when at the Vagner's estate.<br/><br/>Other interesting facts;<br/><br/>It is the 2010 best-selling foreign language film in the UK.<br/><br/>David Fincher is set to direct the Hollywood adaptation of the book, he directed Seven, Fight Club, Panic Room and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt is obviously a fan.<br/><br/>The main characters of Blomkvist and Salander's inspiration originates from Kalle Blomkvist (a Swedish fictional detective) and a grown-up Pippi Longstocking (a Swedish fictional story about a super human girl). <br/><br/>Stieg Larsson, the writer, worked on his books as more of a hobby, with them only being published after his death in 2004. By 2010 they have sold over 27 million copies in 40 countries. His career in writing includes Science fiction journals, political paper journalism and detective inspired stories.<br/><br/>Love it / Loathe it<br/><br/>You may love it for the excellent story, reader or not, and the themes, graphic scenes and characters. However, this could also be the reason you would hate such an adult thrilling romp."

","All the reviews had showed the examples why this movie is good and unique and inspiring so I wont repeat those things.It is really a great movie but I have just a tiny critique about the final episode. I think they should end it after the car accident or lets say Kalle's release from jail. The money transferring stuff was a bit unnecessary and lets say childish and scratchy. I think this happens a lot in European movies because due to the smaller film industry European directors have less chance to describe themselves so they try to show multiple concepts in just one shot. Maybe the American version will be shortened a bit in scenario and strengthen the details of tracking the killer episode. I still give credit to the text and direction they are purely unique and thrilling."

","There are not many films that you are still thinking about several days later, but this is one. The acting from a cast of (in the US / UK ) unknowns was first rate. Not having a well known star helped with the sense of disbelief. Somehow when watching Jennifer Aniston, for instance you always know its her and you can't forget its a film your watching. This was very real, too real in the rape scenes, and in the graphic coverage of the serial killer, but not poorer for attempting verisimilitude. Yes some parts of this were uncomfortable to watch, and God knows how the TV will ever show it uncut. But I applaud the film makers for doing it so well. I couldn't help thinking what a mess Tarantino would have made of it. The female lead was brilliant. I hope they film the other books in the series and let her reprise the role. Easily the best thing I have seen this year."

Even my wife who reads a million Sue Grafton type murder / mysteries was surprised by the major revelations in the movie and did not guess whodunnit as it she is apt to often do.<br/><br/>Although I would give the plot and story and easy 10/10, what I didn't like as much were the actors. I didn't find them believable and sometimes they were too stiff. Not bad acting but just not as good as this story deserved. Maybe too Swedish? Maybe just 2-dimensional? I didn't start warming up to the actors until the last 1/3 of the movie where it seems they must have gotten into the zone with the characters they were supposed to play.<br/><br/>Noomi Rapace did a decent job as the lone-wolf-hacker-for-hire with the troubled past. Michael Nyqvist wasn't terrible, just so so. Better towards the end though.<br/><br/>I do have to agree with some of the other comments about the scenes of sexual violence, especially the scene with Lisbeth's ""Guardian"" in his room. That scene made me cringe and squirm in the same way the rape scene from Blindness made me squirm and cringe. It is brutal. You've been warned.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is worth your while and you will enjoy it if movies like Usual Suspects, Oldboy, Seven, or Silence of The Lambs are your thing. Don't be dissuaded by the comments about the actors as you should watch Män Som Hatar Kvinnor for the plot mainly."

","At first glance Lisbeth and Mikael have nothing in common. The former is a shady tattooed young hacker with an explosive temper and the latter is a nerdy traditional journalist and family man with a penchant for jogging in the woods to ease a troubled mind. Despite their differences, Lisbeth and Mikael collide in more ways than one. As Mikael investigates an unsolved murder perpetrated 40 years ago in a remote northern town, he quickly wades in over his head. Lisbeth's skillset could be helpful to Mikael, but since cooperation isn't her style he had better hope there is truth to the old saying; an enemy of an enemy is a friend.<br/><br/>Produced at a mere $13 million, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo became a worldwide sensation which returned ten times that amount. It did a number of things right including turning the crime thriller genre on its head, frequent role reversals, unpredictability, compelling characters that hit rock bottom and claw their way back, casting the talented Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth, and more. There is depth without pretentiousness. Old school thrills come in modern packaging. Nothing is as it seems (""fair is foul and foul is fair, hover through the fog and filthy air,"" - Macbeth). Intriguing themes include trusting instincts, redemption and determining the appropriate punishment for evil deeds. There are flashes of disturbing and brutal violence and rape.<br/><br/>For the Brits it was the best film NOT in the English language. The Swedish version of the film is more authentic and realistic than the latter Hollywood adaptation. For one thing, Michael Nyqvist is more vulnerable and believable as Mikael than strapping Daniel Craig. The Hollywood version, despite such drawbacks, is still worthwhile as it includes interesting plot twists and is very stylish. The film is based on the novel by Stieg Larsson."

","Having read the books quite a few years ago, I don't remember much of the details from there, but think this film greatly captures the essence of the book. It is of course, not an exact adaptation, however I did not feel that they missed much out that was crucial to the story. There are some discrepancies compared to the book though that I think are unnecessary changes. Just to note, this is the Swedish version that I watched, maybe I will watch the Hollywood one to see if it's better though I don't think it will be.<br/><br/>The cast for this did a good job and was a really good fit for the characters they were portraying; with the exception of one actress that I felt did not fit into the image of her character. Nyqvist does well as Blomkvist, a confident kind of gentle person with attention to detail who had a pretty good upbringing. In contrast Rapace as Salander has had a much darker life and she portrays this perfectly. Her stoic expressions and speech delivery depicts how she has that emotional barrier and makes sure not to get attached to anyone.<br/><br/>The story too is shrouded in darkness and reflects Salander's life. There is quite a bit of gruesome and grotesque images in the film, but fortunately it is easy to tell when it will appear so I can be prepared and avert my eyes. There is also some thriller action and the music score does well to match the mood of the scenes.<br/><br/>This film also had great cinematography – especially with landscapes. Lots of beautiful shots and some great aerial perspectives.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"carbuff","10","0","2","11 May 2015"," Come on, if this isn't a ten, what is?
","Getting right to the point, this is brilliant. Subtitles don't bother me at all--I can read. <br/><br/>I can't imagine why anyone would watch anything other than the extended edition from the comfort of their home. I doubt I'll ever watch the Daniel Craig production, since inevitably it will be slick and over-produced with too much action (although this version is hardly lacking) which will spoil the atmosphere--Hollywood botches all adaptations from foreign source material. <br/><br/>I read almost all nonfiction nowadays, but I do read the reviews of nearly all popular books to stay in the loop. I understand why this trilogy was such a hit in the book form. I wonder if the author, had he lived, could ever have repeated this success, since it seems to be such a singular achievement. <br/><br/>The film has only one slightly sour point in my view, which may actually be a positive. Specifically, if I didn't know better, I would swear that radical feminists were behind this film. I'm a heterosexual male, and I realize that a lot modern entertainment is frequently criticized as being misogynist, which is likely true, although I am probably not the best judge of that. This film, on the other hand, seems to have a very strong anti-male bias to it. <br/><br/>There are really no foul female characters in it, but, when it comes to the ""bad"" male characters, they are downright vile. There are, of course, some ""good"" males in the film too, but the bad ones are really, really repugnant. Makes me feel kind of slimy just being a guy. I expect women are yelling, ''You go girl!"" I suppose some people (radical feminists) would argue that this just reflects reality. While obviously I've got rather personal objections to that, it's not bad to see women get in a few swings of their own. <br/><br/>In summary, this very well-made, very feminist film with a very physically and very intellectually competent non-stereotypical multi-dimensional female lead character is very fresh and very welcome--that's a lot of verys, but it earned them all."

Both have their strengths and weaknesses and it's interesting to compare them.<br/><br/>Noomi Rapace's portrayal is more like a normal person and less punky than Rooney - she is actually quite sweet, although she is less beautiful than Rooney. Noomi reminds me of Nadal. The actor playing Mikael in the Swedish version is a bit stony looking. Daniel Craig was more charming. The Swedish version couldn't boast the star power of Christoper Plummer and Joely Richardson.<br/><br/>The Swedish version is better in some ways: the crimes are more clearly explained. The English version is a bit rushed and confusing in some crucial plot areas. It was interesting to see Lisbeth's parents which is shown in the Swedish version not the English one.<br/><br/>The English version has better casting, a better score and the Zurich transformation of Lisbeth was one of the best parts of the movie.

Then it suddenly flips to scenes of ghastly torture and sexual violence. I had to leave the room. The villains are just so twisted, you can't help but enjoy the poetic justice eventually handed out to them. The heroine is a weird duck. She won't volunteer any information about herself, and she behaves unlike anyone else in film. She is officially mentally ill. I think she is inter-sexed with strong male muscles and female nipples. The film, oddly, has one of the happiest endings I can remember. The film is in Swedish(Danish?) with subtitles. My roommate and I had great fun looking for English cognates. It turns out Swedish (Danish?) is much more like English that I thought it would be. The wintry Swedish (Danish?) countryside reminds me of my home Canada, but it is definitely different.

"brando647","8","0","2","6 March 2012"," Good Adaptation of Larsson's First Millennium Novel
","I remember this movie getting a lot of buzz when I was in college. A lot of other students were chatting about it, but I never really looked into it until David Fincher (one of my favorite directors) chose to adapt the book for American audiences in 2011. So yeah, I was a little late to the party when it came to appreciating Stieg Larsson's Millennium series. It was Fincher's adaptation that grabbed my attention and I've since read all three books and watched the extended additions of each of the three Swedish films. So now that I've had enough exposure to the series to form a reasonable opinion, let me say that I enjoyed the Swedish version directed by Niels Arden Oplev, but not as much as I enjoyed Fincher's version. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a complex story revolving around the forty-year-old unsolved disappearance of a sixteen-year-old girl. Controversial journalist Mikael Blomkvist has been disgraced in the courts when he's found guilty of libel against a billionaire industrialist. Facing a sentence of three months in prison, he's sought out by the wealthy Henrik Vanger to solve the mysterious disappearance of his niece Harriet in 1966. She disappeared without a trace and previous investigations have yielded nothing: no body, no evidence of foul play. Just gone. Henrik believes a member of his unsavory family murdered Harriet, and he hopes Mikael can find the answer he's been waiting for. But Mikael will need help, and he turns to antisocial computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, a woman with a mountain of her own issues, to solve the case.<br/><br/>Having read the book before I watched the Swedish film, I know that a lot was left on due to time constraints. The book is just too detailed to fit everything into a feature film of reasonable length (and this movie already pushes the boundary with a total three hour runtime). The exhaustive detail behind the Wennerström affair, Blomkvist's brief tryst with Cecilia Vanger, further details about his investigation into Harriet's disappearance, and more were removed to trim the story down to a manageable length. I'm cool with that. I understand, and the movie still manages to put together a taut mystery that will keep you engaged until the final reveal. If you haven't seen the movies or read the books, be forewarned: these are slow-burning story lines. Both the book and the movie move pretty slowly at times and can take a while to get moving, but grab hold of you when they do. Mikael's investigation involves a lot of searching through archives and old photos so it doesn't always make for the most interesting cinema material. Fortunately, just when your interest threatens to weaken, the movie throws out a curve-ball to thrust you back into the story. It's a rich story that does weaken a bit when adapted for the screen, so I'd certainly recommend anyone who enjoyed the movie to seek out the book as well if for no other reason than to fill out the rest of the story.<br/><br/>I'm not going to bother comparing the primary cast members here to those in Fincher's film because they're separate entities and I felt both did admirable jobs in filling the roles from the novel. Noomi Rapace is Lisbeth Salander, the title heroine of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. She does a pretty awesome job bringing Lisbeth's her awkward antisocial personality to life, but there were times when it didn't feel legitimate. It wasn't enough to rip me out of a scene or anything, just a minor nitpick and a minor complaint. In general, I thought Rapace did a fine job embracing this character and I she was a great choice for the trilogy. The same can be said for Michael Nyqvist as Blomkvist. I had a hard time accepting him at first because I had come to envision Daniel Craig in the role, but he grew on me fast and I've come to believe he was an excellent choice. I'd even go so far as to say he was a better fit for the character than Craig in terms of style and personality. The two of them have great chemistry between them that helps their odd relationship work. The two of them were inspired casting on the film's part and establish themselves solidly in the characters they would then portray in two more movies. This deliberately-paced foreign film may not appeal to mass American audiences, but those of us who were willing to give it a chance are in for a good film."

I won't tell anything more. This is a movie one of its own kind, so it must be seen.But I always see that if any good foreign language film is made, Hollywood always tries to make a rehashed version ( 13 tzameti is a good example, the original french version is a way better than the Hollywood version.)<br/><br/>The Hollywood version of G.W.D.T looks dull compared to the Swedish version. The actors look perfunctory and the performance by them is not very good. When you make a rehashed version of a foreign flick, you are supposed to make the film better than the original film ( Example is The Departed directed by Martin Scorcese)<br/><br/>I'd say stick with the original Swedish version because the performance by the actors are more lively.

","Well, for all the hoopla surrounding this title with book and multiple language remake, I watched the original version of The Girl with Dragon Tattoo. First the good part, Noomi Rapace is a standout performance basically due to her excellent subtle wildness, sexily dark and decent performance as the central character of the film (not necessarily).<br/><br/>There are few good scenes with the ones worth mentioning with disturbing and gripping tension between the lawyer and lisabeth along-with the climax where serial brutal murders and the psychology behind the motive is described by the killer.<br/><br/>Rest, I would say the brutality shown is uncalled for as it was just a way to forcefully make things more gripping which could have been done either ways by improving the screenplay and adding punch moments. Also, all the talk about the 'hacker' girl doing the stuff had no technical relevance imho for the film although its part of the story originally but it should have been more focused on the finer nuances.<br/><br/>Overall, do watch it for some sherlock holmes moment to unearth the mystery which is a result of excellent story."

","Incredible thriller that reminded me of the first time I watched Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. It's been planned meticulously, with an airtight pacing that knows when to speed up or slow down. The first hour has the protagonists separated, which allows them to each grow on their own merits. When they finally meet, the relationship doesn't feel rushed or forced and it's great to see them grow. The film also manages to have an intriguing mystery, without resorting to overblown ridiculousness. The cinematography was breathtaking, making small apartments stand out as worlds to be explored. Rapace has a fine career ahead of her and I can't wait to see the next two parts in this trilogy."

","Hey everyone out there who responds to really excellent actresses at the top of their game. I have long been an admirer of Lena Endre, through Gossip and Faithless especially. I firmly believe she is the best actress around at the moment and would be a huge star if she were more arrogant (which she most definitely is not) and American (which I am so glad she is not). She has a deep and devastating well of emotional depth and an ability to access those emotions with breathtaking honesty. Noomi Rapace is a good young actress (although I must confess of the young Scandinavians I prefer Anna Bjork but that is personal preference) but Lena is the undisputed master of her craft and it is about time she were given the credit she deserves. This is an actress that Ingmar Bergman called the ""Stradavarius of actors"", the directors perfect instrument. I could go on for hours but please take this thought away with you. Flashy, over exposed emotions are meat and drink for an actor, inhabiting and examining the arc and consciousness of another human being is witchcraft, soul stealing. Lena Endre can steal anyone's soul in a crystal clear 24 frame study of perfection."

","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the adaptation of the first of three novels in a literary franchise penned by Swedish author Stieg Larsson; a recent series of books which went on to garner domestic, and later international, responses of an highly affectionate sort. Their reputation, or aura, appears only to have intensified following Larsson's own unfortunate passing in 2004 at the age of 50; a tragic happening that saw the series remain stagnant for a few years until reaching the stage of filmic pre-production brought about by joint-Swedish and Danish companies. As each book was adapted into a film, and consequently did the rounds at European festival circuits as well as multiplex cinemas alike, the staying power of the whole franchise has escalated – the effect of these numerous things totalling up and resulting in the much more recent announcement, begrudgingly to most, that accomplished American director David Fincher will be reworking them in the English language. This initial adaptation more than makes the grade, the film an electrifying and inspiring slice of cause and effect thriller film-making; a story all-at-once brutally but brilliantly fleshed out from twisting, turning and often sordid foundations into a cut-and-dry piece we are behind every step of the way.<br/><br/>If, in the franchise, there is this overall sense of danger intensification with each new title (the beginning with a titular ""girl"" and her dragon tattoo spilling out into that same titular girl and her consequent ""Playing with Fire"" which further still leads onto a subsequent ""Kicking"" of a ""Hornet's Nest""), then so too is there such a sense as to the general well-being of the central characters in this first film. The film arrives on account of Danish director Niels Arden Oplev , a man working from a screenplay by his Danish colleagues in Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg. It is driven by Swedish performers from an original Swedish text - this sense of two sets of varying people, from differing nations or otherwise, coming together and working towards one goal additionally prominent throughout the piece. Our two leads, a tall and somewhat spindly 24 year old female hacker/surveillance expert named Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, and her eventual ally Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist), a disgraced but ultimately innocent middle-aged man, are two people whose binary oppositions to one another are plentiful, but their forging of a team and taking on the elements epitomising much of the behind the camera camaraderie.<br/><br/>Lisbeth cuts an odd figure, a shaggy looking young woman with piercings over most of her face; spiked black hair and similarly toned makeup. She spies on Blomkvist on account of a security firm whom want tabs kept on him, a journalist with a Stockholm magazine who finds himself six months away from a jail term for loosing a libel case on a powerful domestic businessman. Lisbeth comes across as a post-modern spin on the old private eye character from decades old. Alone, wry and facing imposing odds in a brooding city locale, we observe her treading a fine line between the moral course and the righteous one never really knowing what to think of her. Like private investigators of old, she watches another human being in the only fashion you'd expect for this day and age: via illegal access to their laptop and SMS in-boxes - all before being caught up in a wider web of smut and danger that she didn't initially envisage.<br/><br/>In spite of his initial troubles with the law, Blomkvist is a character the film constructs as homely and friendly; an alluding to innocence through time spent at home with a large, loving group of close friends at a Christmas function. In tandem with this, Nyqvist delivers the subtly disparaged reactions required to have us tempted into siding with him when required as he stands in the street with the news coverage of his case's results all around him. Prior to his sentence taking effect, he is given a job by a company tycoon named Henrik Vanger (Taube); a job that sees him charged with finding a certain Harriet, Henrik's niece, who vanished as a young girl nearly forty years ago. Where Lisbeth cuts a dash as a 21st Century private eye, Blomkvist will go on to epitomise a more classical breed of private investigator; a man of fair age granted that grizzled look and forced out and about into a sea of investigation and logical deduction. In the vein of an American film noir from yester-year, this lead must get the low-down on a specific person who has gone missing.<br/><br/>The body of the film is the two of them working together, a happening born out of Lisbeth's independent attitude to down-tools at her end and contact him over something he's missed in the disappearance. Around their coming together lies a delicate, intricate character study on top of a diligent thriller narrative which keeps on going and keeps working as well as it does. Lisbeth is established to despise men with the men in her life for the best part of the opening half an hour being slimy, grotesque and exploitative. The realisation of her Misandric attitudes, more broadly linked to a past tragedy in life, is wonderfully inserted into the meat of the film's investigative strand; her coming into contact with Blomkvist the bonding with a male specimen that is kind, understanding and is ultimately an individual doing what he's doing for the greater good of another female. Together, they battle what essentially transpires to be a bone-chilling right-wing force of misogyny. The film is an exciting, diligent thriller; a film with an intelligent character study and a cracking narrative always asking us to keep up to its speed, the likes of which it is difficult not to whole heartedly recommend."

","Män som hatar kvinnor is something so rare as a good, tense and exciting Swedish thriller. Based on a successful novel it got a well developed and well worked story that is adapted well to the screen. One of its main strengths is that the characters are well written, outside many stereotypes with a partly hidden but always relevant history that is revealed along the way.<br/><br/>It is a long movie, with a running time of at least 150 minutes (depending on version), but that is due to that the movie really takes its time to establish the characters before the mystery is introduced. I think that was a good choice. It makes the movie long, but never slow or boring. There is always some development to keep interest, to keep viewers on the edge.<br/><br/>The weakest link in the movie, unfortunately, is the mystery. The solution presents itself almost immediately, and is too easy to resolve. However, that doesn't take away the suspense either. So Män som hatar kvinnor is a really good thriller. But to go from good to great, it needed to keep the solution a secret longer.<br/><br/>7/10"

","(Credit IMDb) Forty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from a family gathering on the island owned and inhabited by the powerful Vanger clan. Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder and that the killer is a member of his own tightly knit but dysfunctional family. He employs disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, ruthless computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate. When the pair link Harriet's disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from almost forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history. But the Vanger's are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.<br/><br/>This is well made, often intense, and a good sense of mystery, but as I said in the subject title it's hard to get through sometimes. I understand the point was to be leisurely paced, but sometimes it was too much to bear, and I sometimes thought ""Get on with it"" That being said it contained many chilling moments. Where she gets revenge from the rape is not only chilling, but heavily powerful as well, and it certainly stuck with me. While the middle is hard to get through, the finale made up for it. It was touching, intense, and even shocking. Noomi Rapace is also a pure stand-out.<br/><br/>Performances. Noomi Rapace is a revelation. Her eyes tell the story most of the time, and I was purely astonished by her performance here. She was the main reason that kept me watching. Michael Nyqvist is very solid for the most part. Not as interesting as Noomi's character, but he was good nonetheless. His chemistry with Noomi was good as well.<br/><br/>Bottom line. It's certainly a professionally well made movie, but frustrating to watch sometimes. Is it worth a recommendation? You bet! But if the middle didn't drag so much, it would have been even better.<br/><br/>7 ½ /10"

It reminded me of Murder She Wrote, but on a heightened level.<br/><br/>The true colors of the Vanger family unfolds, and one cannot help but try become the Sherlock Holmes within the audience - for Harriet and her uncle's sake. The island becomes too small for all, as Salander and Blomkvist gets closer to opening Pandora's Box.

","Lizbeth had a particularly tough childhood. She is introverted and afraid of any intimacy or closeness.<br/><br/>Now 24 yet her body resembles that of a teenage boy, wiry and slender. Her face is often covered by lengths of lifeless hair, and often on top of that by a hood drawn close. She has a few more facial piercings than would probably be deemed necessary by mainstream society (the guy who cheated around on Sandra Bullock might like her though), and her attire might best be described as ""Goth casual"".<br/><br/>Perhaps not the chick you'd take home to meet Mum for Sunday brunch, but Lizbeth is not a thug or anyone's skanky girlfriend.<br/><br/>She is also not helpless. After a random attack in the subway Lizbeth fights back even though she is clearly outnumbered and probably outmatched. In desperation she refuses to yield and grabs a broken bottle, swinging it wildly until the thugs leave, but worse yet is still to come for Lizbeth.<br/><br/>After her existing parole officer equivalent fell ill she is informed that she is to deal with a new man. Bossy,manipulative and sleazy, he imposes restrictions on her activities and bank accounts. When Lizbeth informs him she needs cash for a computer he demands ""favours"", then doesn't give her enough cash anyway. Lizbeth goes back to ask for more cash, he repeats his demands and goes a step further, too far. <br/><br/>Way too far.<br/><br/>Lizbeth's response is cool, calm and calculated, but brutal and immediate. It would be fair to say that the demands on her schedule and finances clear up significantly.<br/><br/>Loosely described as a ""researcher/assistant"", Lizbeth is a skilled computer hacker, contracted by those that need Top Secret info but don't mind not knowing how it was sourced. She also benefits from a photographic memory and amazing powers of logic and perception. None of this helps with her people skills though, Lizbeth is still terse, often rude and easily offended.<br/><br/>Lizbeth is contacted for help one day by Michael Blomquist, a journalist in trouble for his personal written attacks on a well known politician. The story is a big deal in the media at the time.<br/><br/>But we'll get back to that.<br/><br/>///////////////// <br/><br/>Michael is hired by a wealthy recluse named Henrick Vanger to investigate the disappearance and presumed murder of a 16 year old girl some 40 years prior. The girl happened to be a carer of Michael's when he was a little boy, wanting to stay out of the limelight for a while he takes the job and moves into a house on Henrick's estate.<br/><br/>Vanger is blunt and forthright, informing Michael that he is sure that the killer is not only still around 40 years later - but is likely a member of his family. Being from Sweden some of Henrick's brothers and other family members had Nazi ties earlier, and they still hold extreme views. Henrick receives a framed pressed flower each year on his birthday from a different point on the globe and is positive he is being teased by the killer, as this was what the young girl Heather did as a child.<br/><br/>In the ensuing days Michael meets some of the extended family and members of the local police force, both inform him that he is wasting his time and effort.<br/><br/>In one of those photo manipulation things that I am positive can only happen in movies Michael manages to find a significant breakthrough, he also finds a code written by Heather, but is disappointed to find that the code is already well known and that despite best efforts no-one has yet been able to crack it to see what it means.<br/><br/>/////////////////////// <br/><br/>When Lizbeth helps out with the code from afar via email Michael tracks her down and asks for her help. For whatever reason Lizbeth agrees and moves in to the remote home on Henrick's manor with Michael.<br/><br/>From here Lizbeth and Michael form an uneasy alliance, Michael is generally a friendly and personable chap but quickly realises Lizbeth reacts quickly and negatively at any attempt at conversation once the topic moves to her.<br/><br/>Lizbeth initiates sex but it seems more as a truce making exercise than real intimacy, and once proceedings end she is soon back to her own bed. As they progress through and seem to be moving closer to a solution they become more at ease in each other's company, however Lizbeth is still prone to becoming instantly defensive and withdrawn, and she wants no part in dealing with authority.<br/><br/>A major development seems to suggest that they are on the hunt for the perpetrator of a series of murders involving young female victims, and it seems that their investigations might be attracting the attention of those that may want them to cease and desist.<br/><br/>////////////////// <br/><br/>It must be said that for a while it seemed that there were too many goings on happening concurrently and there was no way to bring them all together, but even at 2 ½ hours this film didn't really drag on too much.<br/><br/>Thankfully once the truth is finally exposed and the full story is apparent it all makes sense and falls into place, this isn't so much a whodunit in the standard sense but it was nice to have some satisfactory closure rather than an arbitrary ""well I guess we'll never know"" copout.<br/><br/>The investigation serves more as a backdrop for Michael and Lizbeth's relationship as it develops, which allowed tidbits of information about her past and the reasons behind her mental state to be released.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Lizbeth is indeed a complicated girl, a magnetic screen presence, even when subtitled."

","The Europeans excel at producing thriller movies. This, the first of a trilogy, maintains that high standard.<br/><br/>The story: a disgraced journalist is hired by the head of a super-rich industrialist family to find his niece, Harriet, who disappeared forty years earlier. Together with a raunchy, Gothic, young female computer hacker, the two unlikely partners in detection unravel the mystery of Harriet's disappearance and unearth a horrific family secret.<br/><br/>As stories go, it's on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense that gradually builds to a finale that includes a nod to Silence of the Lambs (1991) and others similar. So, yes, the plot treads well-known territory; however, it's distinctive from others you may recall, in that the young female hacker is one of the cleverest and toughest female protagonists to grace the screen since Ripley socked it to the mother of all Aliens (1986).<br/><br/>So, it's an ultra-violent (at times), in-your-face tour-de-force combination of introspective and analytical detection, coupled within moments of brutality that some will – for sure – find difficult to watch; in that regard, I'm reminded of the gory brutality of Eastern Promises (2007). The acting is, in my opinion, almost flawless; only some of the early scenes and clips seemed a bit stagy. Kudos, however, go to the two main stars: Michael Nyqvist as the convicted journalist, Mikael Blomqvist; and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander – a newcomer for me, and one whom I will continue to watch as her career develops.<br/><br/>Cinematography, editing, and sound-track are all topnotch, as expected from well-produced and financed Swedish films. Coupled with a narrative structure and script that grab you by the throat, I had no trouble sitting through the entire 152 minutes without any fidgeting or clock watching. Overall, the pacing and the gradual revelation of the interlocking story details reminded me very much of the way the mystery unfolded in The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), one of the best mystery/detective stories ever put to film (although, the book was much better).<br/><br/>My only (muted) criticism of the story comes to this: while I know, from personal experience, that almost unbelievable co-incidences do actually occur, there is one very necessary story co-incidence – a married couple, on honeymoon, who take and keep a crucial photograph – without which the mystery would have forever remained unsolved. You'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>And see this one, I think you should, despite any misgivings you might have about reading sub-titles. It's a very visual story, and the talking is just enough. I'm eagerly looking forward to the second and third chapters. Highly recommended."

It nearly turns into two or three movies by the end, though it's satisfying enough despite suffering from slow pacing throughout much of the second act. The climax of Act II feels like it should be the end of the movie, but alas, the main premise has not yet been answered, so we march into Act III, which is a bit choppy and unpolished, though it does deliver an emotionally satisfying climax, contrasting with the action-filled climax of Act II. The resolution, so long in coming, stretches into multiple plot lines to cover all the bases and tie up loose ends, with a somewhat glaring ""hole"" that I cannot reveal without including a spoiler; but by this point you just want the movie to end and so don't care so much, as it's been a good-enough ride.<br/><br/>Out of all the movies out there, this one is certainly better than overrated movies like Inception (no villain except Cobb's guilt, no danger because all action takes place in the dream state, and nothing at stake we care about!) and Avatar (dialog to rival the worst B movie ever made - Titanic deserved being #1, this movie doesn't deserve to be in the top 10!).

Both the actors do a good job with their characters.

But also it was because the writers didn't skimp on her character development, like they did with the storyline.<br/><br/>So the impression I was left with was, while this was a good attempt and a very watchable movie, it wasn't near as gripping as the book was. I wouldn't mind seeing another attempt with a Hollywood remake if they put some talent behind it, just to see what someone else could do to bring the mystery that the book possessed to the screen."
