"Jared_Andrews","7","16","17","15 December 2018"," Ryan Coogler's deft touch could have made this great
","The best moments of 'Rocky/Creed' movies are the ones that make you feel something. Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few.
Adonis ""Donny"" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series.
Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies.
On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out.
Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle.
Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason.
In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy."
"tomek-sulkowski","5","332","455","4 December 2018"," Protagonist has no arc and an emotional development of 9-year old. I was rooting for Drago in this one.
","Seriously, Adonis has shown nothing but how needy and insecure he is. I didn't buy his change at all and really couldn't feel what was he supposedly fighting for in that last fight. Yeah he had a kid in a meantime, but he remained the same selfish brat.<br/><br/>Both Dragos were FAR more interesting. Victor being this kinda confused brute, and Ivan having an actual arc: from using his son and manipulating him for any cost to gain back the approval of the wife and Russia, to accepting that it's the son who is important to him now, and spending time training (running scene) with him back in Ukraine by the end.<br/><br/>If this was a setup for Drago spin-off then kudos, I'm interested!<br/><br/>Watching the dilemmas of Adonis I caught myself rolling my eyes twice or thrice, and I'm not the rolling-eyes type. I seriously feel the need now to watch a GOOD fighting movie now to see if I haven't lost it and just stopped liking these, because I just don't get all the praises this movie gets."
"arabnikita","5","248","349","27 November 2018"," Weak all over
","Creed 2 (my personal 3 key points):<br/><br/>*A boxing movie with 10 minutes of boxing+training and 2 hours of talking and deciding things.<br/><br/>*Nearly a copy paste of Rocky 4 and if you thought that that fight was unrealistic, wait for this one.<br/><br/>*When Rocky was fighting in his movies even against a Russian I wholeheartedly wanted him to win because he came from nothing, struggled and had spirit. Adonis acts like boxing is his hobby, I just cant feel for him.<br/><br/>I cant say more without spoiling... But very weak overall"
"rishabhsinha2611","5","230","323","5 December 2018"," Dissapointment!
","Some poeple really liked it. But i guess i was expecting way too much from the film. The trailer was brilliant. And creed 1 was a much superior film. The film lacked soul. Everything seemed superficial and predicitable. Even the fight in the end was sort of a 10min montage. The Rocky series is known for its background scores, gritty action and is motivating. Creed is just a film without a backbone."
"slhaokippublic","1","106","149","16 February 2019"," Maybe the protagonists and antagonists should change places.
","Oh man.<br/><br/>We kind of expected it to follow a formulaic plot where the hero loses and then wins in the end. But what this movie does to fill out the in-betweens is so crammed full of cliches you couldn't fit in a fart even if you wanted to.<br/><br/>I actually rooted for the Drago father-son duo. Accidental? Not so much. We've a protagonist who is very unlikeable. Just because he's the lead doesn't mean we must like him automatically. He comes across as unsympathetic. In this second installment he just comes across as a spoiled brat.<br/><br/>And what's up with the wife? They just had a child and she feels the need to ""get out of the house"" and go to the studio or something. Do new mothers relate to that? Cos that was a huge talking point among the group of friends i went to see the movie with, mostly friends of my wife. I think that happened so that we could have that scene of Adonis alone with his child but there could've been better ways to bring that about. The story writers gave her this hearing-impairement issue which is passed on to their daughter, maybe to make her more sympathetic. But it doesn't elicit that response. And her singing as her husband walks towards the ring was so cringeworthy. It even ended abruptly. She had her music and that could've been written into the story better.<br/><br/>As for Ivan and Victor, they were the true underdogs in this movie. A father fallen from grace, left by his wife and abandoned by his country, living vicariously through his son's victories, looking for redemption. The movie tries to portray Victor as a brute with barely a line the entire movie but this relationship had potential for so much more friction between a father driving his son to serve his own needs and a son who's a man in his own right who could've had interesting clashes with his father. But no, the movie needs us to root for the heroes so apart from their training montages we rarely see much of the Drago's relationship.<br/><br/>And the Russians. The wife and entourage stand up and walk out before the match is over. And the son and father lose heart. I get that Ivan's point this whole time has been to get his ex-wife's approval/respect and his country's acceptance again but that story is so poorly written it just doesn't hit. With a runtime of over two hours, they should've done better.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are also poorly choreographed and edited it looks uninteresting. Maybe an actor more the size of Adonis for a better suited match would've been interesting. To make Victor that much more bigger for the sake of villanous threat was a mismatch.<br/><br/>I actually wanted Victor to win. The movie was that bad."
"andymclennan","4","124","178","13 February 2019"," So predictable
","I really enjoyed the first film, but this one is so predictable and derivative, they've clearly run out of ideas.<br/><br/>The training and fight sequences (which make a Rocky movie a Rocky movie) only make up a short percentage of the running time.
In between those sequences is where this really suffers - ""Mr and Mrs Creed"" are no Rocky and Adrian.<br/><br/>The fights are decent enough but it's all too predictable.
Time to let this franchise die with dignity."

"AGood","7","6","6","23 February 2020"," We Need a Viktor and Ivan Drago Spin Off
","This movie is not as good as the first Creed. It felt like a remake of Rocky 3 and was just too formulaic. However what made the movie for me was the final scenes where my appreciation of the movie changed by simply seeing the final round from the perspective of the Dragos and the aftermath of the fight with the Drago's.<br/><br/>Adonis is done for, his story arc is ove and I don't want there to be more for him. He is happy and complete. Rocky's story is now done too. But Ivan and Viktor Drago were the only interesting people in this movie. And I simply want to see what happens to them both now after this ending.<br/><br/>I want to see them pick up the pieces and be successful. They've earned it after the ending which was unheard of in a movie of this type.<br/><br/>Please Sly and Dolph make it happen."
"dtnmusic","3","123","190","11 December 2018"," Shows how many fake reviews are out there
","Very MINOR spoilers. First of all, take a look at all the recent 10/10 reviews, and it still sits at 7.8. Do the math. Sad that studio's do that. Anyways, very lame story, way too much forced drama outside the ring. Infact, this is hardly a boxing boxing, it's days of our lives with a few fights in between. I almost walked out 2 or 3 times. 2 people actually did, out of 10. Basically every situation was forced and/or not believable, in a bad way. Next, Michael B Jordan does a horrible job of being the heavyweight champion of the world. Such a pansy throughout, in the ring, and outside. Get this, even as the son of Apollo Creed, even as the champion of the world, he has not one friend or entourage member. Reeeeally. All I kept thinking was, THIS guy is the same status/level as Mike Tyson was? This pansy who has no friends, no money, and goes to a diner with his girl after winning the belt? And the patrons, sort of care he's there? Oh and his woman, who sells out the Fillmore as a singer, doesn't get recognized by the black crowd. Cool. Don't get me started about her singing performance while walking Creed into the ring at one point. Ugg. I'm gonna get writer's cramp. I'm out."
"psychotico","2","83","127","13 February 2019"," Not what I expected
","The first fight was better than the second fight.
Adonis ribs are broken again and he fights as if they weren't broken... very unrealistic and stupid hollywood fantasy. Makes me sympathize more with Drago, no moral in the end, Russians made to look bad for the second time, guess it's easy when they are presented by non-russian actors."
"gashf-86701","3","112","177","1 December 2018"," Terrible sequel
","I'm not sure if I saw the same movie as 90% of the people on here who voted it 9 and above.<br/><br/>I thought it was slow, a movie that lingered on the moody pouting Adonis Creed and his fiancé who is dealing with her hearing loss. Adonis wins his belt early in the film with a unconvincing fight scene and then is targeted by the rejected mommy's boy Son of Drago who is a bit of a beast.<br/><br/>Long and short of it is this film meanders around the slow paced relationships between Adonis, his wife to be and Rocky. It never really gets going and then it really gets unrealistic when you see the head to head between Creed and Drago with Creed clearly being a super middleweight at best against the heavyweight Russian. It's as if boxing has thrown out all its weight classes and put AJ in the ring against GGG.<br/><br/>I won't give much more away but I considered walking out during the early stages of the film but was interested to see how it ended. Was funny to see Brigette Nielsen back though and Ivan Drago cuddling his son at the end.<br/><br/>Hopefully Sly will hang up his gloves after this one."

"MJL_Uncensored","9","181","298","24 November 2018"," Delivers the Kind of Punch You Expect
","You have to give Sylvester Stallone credit--he has a gift for remixing the same movie over and over and again and making you actually care. Maybe it's because he focuses on the one thing that matters most in storytelling: compelling characters. And Creed II is full of them.<br/><br/>First, there's Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), the brooding, bratty, world champion with a chip on his shoulder. There's Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), the downtrodden wise sage who only recognizes his role in things when the chips are down. There's Bianca Taylor, a talented singer suffering from hearing loss and her love for a self-destructive boxer. There's Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), the weary widow of Apollo Creed who is consistently forced to check her man-child son, and then there are the villains. Ivan and Victor Drago (Dolph Lundgren and Florian Munteanu), the Russian outcasts seeking redemption for the failures of Ivan Drago. Everyone has a purpose in this film, and everyone has a place in moving the narrative forward: avenging the actions of Rocky IV.<br/><br/>This is a straight-up reboot of a Cold War classic, complete with the final match taking place in Russia. You know what to expect. The challenge from Ivan's son is the kind of storybook rematch the sports world loves. You know Creed has to take the fight to prove himself. And you know at some point, Victor Drago will get the better of him, setting us up for a training montage that never seems to get old. You see, when Rocky IV was released, it wasn't just a boxing film, it was practically a propaganda film about the superiority of American values and ideals. In Creed II, it's not about the country--it's personal. It's about discovering what matters most to you in your career and your own life. And as cliched as that may all sound, it works amazingly well in this film, thanks in part to the strength of the movies character development, phenomenal actors who keep the theatrical bits grounded and brilliant fight choreography and cinematography to settle scores.<br/><br/>I'll be straight with you, we shouldn't like Adonis Creed, but we do. He's a temperamental grown man baby that even knocks himself in the movie for ""acting like a b---h."" We shouldn't care about Victor Drago--he's a carbon copy of his android like father Ivan and barely has enough dialogue earn a film credit. But we do because we know that his father is living through him. The once powerful Ivan is an outcast in his homeland, and Victor's mother walked out on both of them because she has no respect for losers, so they're surprisingly sympathetic characters in their quest to be menacing. And we shouldn't care about Rocky's meandering ruminations about putting family over boxing when at no point in his career, did he ever do the same. Yet somehow this movie manages to make you care because the film understands that it's real power are in those small reflective moments building up to the fight. Moments like Creed's return to the local cheesesteak house and being welcomed by the fans who urge him to take the battle against Drago. Moments like Bianca and Adonis laying on the floor together like they did in the first film pondering their relationship and what Adonis's decision means for them. It's moments like Rocky pondering the broken relationship he has with his own son and trying to figure out if he dares to make amends. This is the glue that holds these films together--putting family above career and ego. And when it finally comes time to fight, your emotions are so heavily invested in the outcome that you'll find yourself (as did my audience) verbally cheering on Adonis Creed.<br/><br/>And in the end, it's the smallest of gestures by Sylvester Stallone (which I won't spoil) that lets you know that Rocky Balboa has nothing left to give and it is now Adonis Creed's time to shine in whatever sequel they have planned for us. Creed II a great time at the movies, even if it's a predictable one."
"bledingham74","10","256","431","21 November 2018"," Seriously considered walking straight into the next showing when it was over
","All movie I kept looking at my watch because I didn't want it to end. It was 130 minutes that felt more like 45.<br/><br/>The fights (and there were more than normal) were great, but the movie was much more than about the fights. It was about family, loss, motivation, legacy, and the part that really touched me was the focus on fathers and sons.<br/><br/>Dolph Lungdren and The Big Nasty were perfect villains, but unlike most movies you see the loss that the villains endured and what shapes them. I couldn't help but feel for them a little too - particularly the son.<br/><br/>Sly was obviously great as Rocky, and he was more down to earth and relatable than ever. Smart how they keep fading him more and more into the supporting role as Caple, like Coogler do a great job of remembering he is not the focus. I loved that Little Duke got more of a roll, and I think that he's someone who would be able to carry the franchise as mentor/coach if Sly ever decides to give this up. Phylicia Rashad was charming as MaryAnn, and you could feel her emotions going through this again with the family who took her husband's life. MBJ and Tessa Thompson were absolutely brilliant, and their chemistry is just so natural. Bianca walking out with them and singing leading Donnie to the ring for the final fight - CHILLS!!!<br/><br/>The ending fight sequence, and what happens after and how they have separate endings at the same time for Donny and Rocky made it the best ending of any of these films.<br/><br/>As a lifelong Rocky fan (my Dog's name is Clubber), I think I actually like the Creed franchise more. I like the cultural difference with Creed, and it just seems more grounded and for lack of a better word quality writing and directing. If they make 10 more I'd go and see all of them!"

"vladanzivanovic","1","113","191","9 December 2018"," Absolute trash, you can polish a turd but it will always be a turd.
","Spoilers? Nothing you haven't seen in the trailer...<br/><br/>This in honest assessment. I'm not going be dishonest to you like the others will.<br/><br/>There are many issues. Firstly, this franchise should never been made.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing but a sad cash grab. You can't bring back a killer in Ivan Drago and pretend it is all cool, and yes it could of worked, IF they established Ivan Drago's return sooner in the series, maybe hinted him in the first Creed, and at least give him some back story, maybe show a flash back, just anything... what is going on here, and have not been this disappointed since Star Wars Episode 8. The problem here is, there were way too many loop holes, and plot issues, mistakes, decisions Stallone even regrets that were made in the previous Rocky sequels, for anyone to be able to patch things up and move forward.<br/><br/>Adonis Creed, the character you gave a chance, but in the end, he is just too damn unlikeable, and complete child with a loud mouth, throwing tantrums, disrespecting Balboa as well. ""I'm dangerous"" after hearing that, I couldn't help but burst out laughing... yeah, real dangerous!<br/><br/>At least Apollo was serious enough as a character, and had the qualities that were likable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately in Creed II, I just can't help rooting for the other guy. Plus Creed is way too small in size to take down the Russian, makes no sense at all. Why did Creed want to fight Drago Jr? Creed was adopted and never knew his real father, so it felt forced and really had no place as a story, because like I said ""too many issues from previous Rocky sequels"" that are completely unsalvageable.<br/><br/>To make it worse, the antagonist Drago Jr came across as a big teddy bear, just didn't feel he was menacing enough, awful casting decisions cost them in a big way. The writing of Drago Jr character gave him about as much character as a turnip and it didn't work, at all. Not to mention Viktor Drago looked nothing like his parents, so I ask the question - was he adopted? Perhaps Viktor and Adonis share something in common, if they decide to make a 3rd part, heaven forbid.<br/><br/>The music, forgettable, bad, just complete garbage, who green lit this?<br/><br/>They were also trying too hard to make the premise feel like real life, which is the same mistake Rocky 6 did with bringing in subpar real life sports commentators, just cheapened the entire production. It was like watching a typical ShowTime boxing advertisement on pay TV, not an A grade film production.<br/><br/>No wonder Stallone retired Rocky, after watching the dreadful performances throughout the entire cast, he did the right thing and had no choice but to shelve Balboa once and for all. Also I was disappointed with Stallone in this one as well, was he trying? Or was it the writer's fault? Did the creators not watch any of the previous films? They should be ashamed of themselves, pathetic effort folks.<br/><br/>If things couldn't get worse, think again. They cut the Ivan Drago vs Rocky Balboa fight in the hospital, they also cut Spider Rico's funeral, and... they cut the locker room scene between Adonis Creed and Viktor Drago. IF they added these scenes? And dropped the crappy music? Who knows, it could have been watchable.<br/><br/>Balboa is also not his punch drunk self either, it's like an alternate timeline movie, it felt like something else. It's not the Rocky we grew up with.<br/><br/>They will tell you, it's just like Rocky 3 and 4, and they will tell its great! They will say ""long time Rocky fan"" but really if they were? They would just tell it how it is, and they will tell you that Creed II sux."
"DomNickson843","1","93","158","4 December 2018"," Completely unnecessary.
","This film is completely unnecessary just like the first movie. Adonis Creed is such a lame, cocky, unlikable character. In every fight scene he gives off that ""Jerkface"" vibe. I mean even the opponents in the first creed are rediculous and unmemorable. Everytime I saw the first ones trailer I was like, ""Why did you make such a cash grab of a series?"" It was basically a cloned tumor leaching off the success of the brilliantly written Rocky series. It wanted to be Rocky so bad but it sucked!<br/><br/>Then I heard about this sequel and I couldn't help but feel that this movie could of worked if they presented it in a way as if Adonis was going to join his father Apollo's side six feet under. I think that maybe if they built Drago's son up like they did in Rocky IV they would of had the suspence they needed to pull it off. However, Drago's son doesn't have too much build up because this film is focused more on Rocky and Drago's past. These two stole the show even if they weren't trying to.<br/><br/>The ups for this film: The old school cast reunites. Other than that everything is overdone and honestly makes me rather watch Rocky IV again."

","I paid half price to see this, and felt I paid for what I saw. For instance, it's predictable. There was quite a few scenes that did nothing for progressing the movie. I wondered why they moved Adrian's grave to a new location. I wondered why they didn't make Drago's ex wife (Bridgette) walk over to Apollo's wife and say good luck like she did before, only this time she could have told her to fk off? I wondered why Rocky was telling D to not fight Drago when Rocky didn't exactly the same thing to avenge Apollo's death? The movie was dry and soulless. The music could have been inspiring in moments to move you along. Father Drago could have been a lot more human and aggressive than just plain angry and silent. They rushed this movie."

"nsharath009","8","101","185","19 November 2018"," ""Creed II"" is an outstanding sequel and one of the year's best films
","Creed was a major surprise. Seriously. As much as I love the Rocky franchise, was there any reason to assume that what was essentially Rocky VII, just without a focus on the character we know and love, would be a success? Sure, it had an exciting young actor at the center and an up and coming filmmaker in Ryan Coogler at the helm. But still, how good could it be? Well, the answer was that it turned out to be an Oscar nominee, a Golden Globe winning film, and one of the year's best. Now, Creed II hits this week and, defying all odds, is nearly as good. This flick will also end up on a top ten list for me. It more than delivers, it flies high. What easily could have tarnished what's come before instead movingly builds on it. This is one of the ten best films of 2018, unlikely as that may seem.<br/><br/>The movie is a sequel to Creed, continuing the Rocky series by focusing on the late Apollo Creed's son Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan). First the number one contender for the heavyweight championship of the world, Adonis soon becomes champ. It's a wonderful night for him, his girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson), and his trainer, former champ Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), A challenge unlike any other is coming though, in Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), the imposing son of former Balboa/Creed rival Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Everyone knows that Ivan killed Apollo in the ring, so Adonis feels like he has no choice but to fight him. Rocky warns him of the danger, but it's no use. Thus begins a true Rocky sequel, just told with all of the additional emotion that Creed brought to bear. Steven Caple Jr. directs a script that Stallone co-wrote with Juel Taylor (Cheo Hodari Coker and Sascha Penn also worked on drafts at one point), while supporting players include Wood Harris, Russell Hornsby, Phylicia Rashad, Andre Ward, and more. Ludwig Göransson composed the score, while cinematography is by Kramer Morgenthau.<br/><br/>I'm not kidding. Creed II is phenomenal. Joke that it's Rocky VIII if you must, but there's way more to it than that. The emotional stakes that both Adonis and Rocky face, not to mention both Drago men, are effective and impactful. That's a true testament to Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone for sure, though also for returning player Dolph Lundgren, plus Florian Munteanu. Tessa Thompson again is fantastic, while Phylicia Rashad lends some gravitas in her few scenes. Again though, this is about Jordan, and whether he's with Stallone or Thompson, he has electric chemistry with both. The fight scenes don't have the style that the aforementioned Ryan Coogler brought last time, but they're still among the franchise's best. Very little here will surprise you, but damn if it isn't incredibly moving to watch.
Don't expect Creed II to contend for Academy Award love like Creed did, but I will say that Jordan and Stallone are just as good this time out (the same goes for Thompson as well). The former is even more front and center, while the latter truly becomes a supporting character, though one with literally decades of history that both the actor and the audience is pulling from. This is an example of how amazing studio films can be when they actually care. This may have been made in part because of money, but the powers that be also made sure that everyone involved was invested. The end result is a brilliantly entertaining movie with tons of heart.<br/><br/>Fans of this franchise are in for a real treat, as Creed II hits all the notes you want from both a Creed sequel as well as a new Rocky installment. It's hard to imagine anyone who's a fan not falling in love with this one too. You'll literally stand up and cheer. The confidence with which the filmmakers and stars work within the expected realm of the series is really something to behold. The way this is going, I'd watch Jordan and Stallone make another half dozen of these. Together, they've truly given you reason to care about this franchise. Once you see it, you'll understand why..."

","The movie begins with Creed, a loud-mouthed thug, beating a generic adversary and claiming the heavyweight championship. On the other side of the world, in Ukraine (later Russia, who cares, it's all the same, right?) Ivan Drago silently (as not to invoke too much humanity) trains his son while living in abject poverty conditions, his son also working carrying bricks for a living. Then we cut back to Creed just being super rich and pampered and successful, he's not even carrying his own luggage. Then Drago shows up in America, ready to challenge Creed (because of the stupid and laughable reason being that his wife left him because he lost to Rocky), and Creed reacts just like a back alley thug, with ""dey iced my pops"" and when Rocky tries to put some sense into him, telling him that his fight with Drago was not worth it because he had brain damage afterwards, Creed lashes out on Rocky and goes on to get beat by Drago's son, who of course plays dirty and cheats apart from being stronger and better, only to not learn anything, never give out a valid reason why Creed fights (his story is not Rocky's at all, Rocky was fighting for dignity), quick training montage somewhere dirty as to reflect how he's humbling down, and then beat Drago's son anyway. By the end of the movie I felt so sorry for Drago's son, even after they tried so hard to portray him as an amoral brute. This was supposed to be the fight that avenges his father and it played out superficially, the adversary was cardboard and that was bad, Apollo Creed had personality, that's why they are still using him goddammit, it's a movie that tries to portray that working hard will bring results but actually portrays the opposite, pampered rich loud-mouth thug beats poor Russian fighter that carries bricks for a living, and misses a huge opportunity to delve deeper into the struggles of parents that have children with disabilities."

"rickyspanish-06172","3","74","135","2 December 2018"," This Movie is for Girls - RIP Rocky
","This movie was lame and disappointing. I am a huge Rocky fan and really enjoyed Creed, I also consider Rocky 4 to be one of the greatest films of the 20th century, so needless to say I was super excited to see this film.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see the Dragos come calling from Russia and Creed and Rocky dive head first into 90 minutes of action. Instead Adonis is supposed to be conflicted about fighting Drago and Rocky tells him not take the fight. Why? I am still not sure. We're never offered a real reason and given the back story that's amazing. I felt like the movie was trying to just shove internal conflict and emotion down my throat from the very beginning. You'd think Creed would jump at the challenge and we'd see awesome montages, fighting, wins/losses, whatever. Instead the story drags, it's predictable, and even the montages suck.<br/><br/>Creed and his girlfriend get engaged and conceive a baby while still living in their crappy apartment in Philly. I couldn't help wondering how the Heavyweight World Champion and his trainer Rocky are still broke. She has the baby (who cares), and the baby might be deaf (who cares). They take the baby to get hearing tests (who cares) and Creed cries (who cares). This goes on for like 40 minutes and basically ruins the movie.<br/><br/>The only redemptive part of this movie was that Dragos were cool and fun to watch and of course Stallone is always fun to watch as Rocky. I was surprised to see Bridgette Nielsen which was also a treat. But in the end this movie was so bad that I couldn't help but cheer for Viktor Drago and hope that Creed gets killed in the ring just like his father."
"plet-54046","5","42","73","22 November 2018"," Predictable

"Carolyn_Channing","9","45","79","20 November 2018"," A worthy sequel
","Essentially hand-picked by Coogler to take on the sequel, Caple orchestrates a worthy sequel that still has those needed references to the ""Rocky"" franchise the fans crave, but makes a point to build up Adonis' own story.<br/><br/>From a screenplay by Stallone and Joel Taylor, ""Creed II"" picks up six fights after Creed lost to ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan in the first movie. Having won them all, he's now up against the champion Danny ""Stuntman"" Wheeler (Andrew Ward) for the title. Creed takes the belt (and the keys back to his car that Wheeler took from the brief fight they had in the first movie) and closes the night by proposing to his girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson). All seems to be going right for Creed.<br/><br/>But in the Ukraine, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) has dreams of a hero's return to Russia by shaping his son, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), into an even more powerful boxer than he was. In exile since losing to Balboa in ""Rocky IV,"" the Dragos wake up every morning with a singular goal: beat Creed like Ivan did his father. This leads father and son to Philadelphia to challenge Creed and Balboa to a title fight. With footage from ""Rocky IV"" used in ESPN highlights, Creed can't look away from footage of his father dying in the ring at the hands of Drago over 30 years ago. Of course, the two sons are going to fight.<br/><br/>The movie then turns to the deep-rooted drama that happens in all the ""Rocky"" movies: why fight? With the guilt of not calling off the Apollo Creed-Ivan Drago fight still hanging over him, Balboa doesn't want any part of it. But of course, Adonis wants to avenge his father. This leads to an impasse between the two that causes some soul searching for both men.<br/><br/>""Creed II"" gives us the intense training montages and incredible fights that are a trademark in the ""Rocky"" franchise, but what really stands out are the things that happen outside of the ropes. What starts out as a revenge tale slowly evolves into a story of fathers and sons and the building of new legacies. At its core is the work of Jordan, who again as Creed delivers a performance that shows why he's a movie star. His charisma matched with his talent is a total package that any franchise dreams of. Then there's the chemistry between Jordan and Thompson that adds another powerful layer. Stallone, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing Balboa in ""Creed,"" once more delivers in the role that has defined his career - especially in the movie's powerful ending.<br/><br/>What Coogler did with ""Creed"" was special: taking a beloved franchise like ""Rocky"" and reshaping it for a new generation. But Caple took on an even riskier assignment by doing the sequel. Thankfully he succeeded, and he did it by focusing on the characters and not the legend of the intellectual property"

","Wow just saw an early screening, what an amazing movie experience. I will not spoil anything, just give a honest review. After watching the first movie I was very surprised how great it was, and already then like many others I thought how insain it would be to have a epic revenge rematch with Creed and Dragos son. Rocky 4 was definitely the best sequal in the series thanks to the awsome, buff, brutal, aponent Drago.<br/><br/>I read alot about people wanting this, and when this was officially announced I was overwhelmed! The history behind this match is everything, and I love the way they keep expanding the epic story so well. I loved Creed I was more then a movie to me, and creed 2 takes it to other level. I'm not however saying this is 100% perfect, but certainly a great experience! Fan of the series or not watch this it is a great entertaning, high quality, action packed, inspirational, emotional, heartwarming movie almost anyone can enjoy."

","This film is great. It's so very deeply moving. Tears streamed my face during certain deeply meaningful scenes in this film.<br/><br/>The film isn't really about boxing nearly as much as it is about the love of family. Like the 1961 film ""The Hustler"", it's not really about winning and losing, either. It's about familial love, especially the love of fathers and sons, estrangement, loss, forgiveness, redemption, and reconciliation.<br/><br/>The film is about true family values and how very much more important they are than anything else in this life. Although the boxing scenes are great, they are only incidental to the overarching theme of family in this film. My most heartfelt kudos and thanks to the filmmakers of this great story."
"krzysiektom","2","70","131","24 November 2018"," Must be a mistake
","Maybe i watched a different movie, because i cannot believe how good or even raving reviews this one is getting. I have found Creed II disappointing, with a simplistic and predictable script, full of cliches. At least the boxing and training parts should be good, but they weren't either. The boxing in this film seems more like street fighting, with boxers landing more clean punches within the first minute of the fight than Mayweather jr or even Tyson in his heyday could in entire 12 rounds. Completely unrealistic. And training for such an important fight in a desert? Please. The film doesnt say anything honest about the boxing business, we see here a successful US boxer living like a recluse, in a mediocre apartament, surrounded only by his one loyal aide and his wife, what about the usual entourage and swarm of people like masseurs, coaches, media assistants and publicists, financial advisers and groupies? What about the money and the financial motivations? Every top boxing fight is basically about earning millions of USD, in the real world. It is a simple film for the naive audience. OK if it was at least entertaining, but nope."

","This movie definitely needed Ryan Coogler to serve as a director. When I first watched Creed 1, I was skeptical but was impressed because there was a lot of heart and emotion in the film. Even though Creed lost in the first movie, you felt his growth was bigger as a boxer and a person than in this one.<br/><br/>This movie felt like somebody's fan fiction come to life. It's totally predictable and doesn't take any risks. The fighting isn't bad but the emotional growth that Creed experiences in the first movie seems to be totally ignored so that they can make him an irrational hothead just so that he can take the fight with Drago."

"Robert_duder","9","41","74","24 November 2018"," Living up once again to it's 40 year legacy
","Creed breathed new live into the Rocky franchise because it's less about Rocky and far more about Adonnis Creed. The best thing about Creed II is that it focuses so heavily on father and son relationships and what that means in three very different circumstances. Rocky and his son are estranged and Rocky doesn't know how to reach out to him and there is that father-son relationship between Rocky and Adonnis. You have Adonnis and Apollo, the son trying to live up to his father's legendary status but now also avenge his death and you have Ivan Drago and his son where he has raised this child in the shadow of his own failure. Rocky IV is generally considered the highlight of that franchise and certainly his greatest battle and this being a direct sequel to that makes Rocky fans happy and fans of the new Creed storyline happy to. It has deep drama and story, incredible action and intense performances. The scene where Drago and Rocky meet in Rocky's restaurant is complete perfection.<br/><br/>
I wasn't sure how I would feel about Michael B Jordan taking over the Rocky franchise and whether I could ever buy him as the underdog boxer that I would root for. Creed was good but I still wasn't sure. I'm no longer unsure. Jordan completely owns this role and proves himself fully. He leads this film with great power and intensity. Sylvester Stallone returns as Adonnis' mentor and trainer Rocky Balboa. He takes even more of a secondary position in the film but enough that fans will still love seeing him back in the role but doesn't get in the way of the main story. Dolph Lundgren is incredible in this film. This might actually be his best role he's ever had period. In Rocky IV he was a machine that was meant to be a steel monster but now we see his humanity and what the loss has done for him and how he's trained his son. He is literally the highlight of this movie. Equally as impressive is Florian Munteanu who plays Drago Junior. He captures that steel monster that his father once was but he plays so much drama and intensity in his expressions. There is a scene with him and his father at a dinner table where you literally see him looking for approval. Tessa Thompson also returns as Bianca and gets even more screen time and an even better role than the first. Her and Jordan have good chemistry and I wasn't sure about her either until this movie. Phylicia Rashad also returns in a larger role as Adonnis' mother and gets some really solid screen time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Steven Caple Jr. had a big job ahead of him. He's a virtual unknown director taking over for someone who got fans and critics on their side with the first Creed. I was worried this was a mistake bringing on a director with little experience but he captures this story and takes what Creed started and vaults it into the stratosphere. He packs almost too much into one film but it harkens back to the great Rocky films, pays homage to that but hyper focuses on Creed and that new legacy. Creed II is as good as the best from this franchise and ensures we get more in the future. Watching my idol (Stallone) hit the big screen yet again was an unforgettable experience. 9/10"
"cliffmerayah","7","3","3","2 January 2020"," Not the greatest but still really good
","Creed II delivers the punch but doesn't quite land the knockout. While the familiar formula still works as inspiring as ever, it is mainly good ol' Rock that steals the protagonist's spotlight. Without Sly's solid rock performance this movie would have been just another fight movie. And although the Creed saga reaches new hights in storytelling, we must admit that Adonis just isn't as charismatic as Rocky or as his dad, Apollo. This time he can't even step out of his opponent's shadow, who has a far more compelling story to tell than the one Adonis brings. So, this might not be the fight of the century but there is certainly some rumbling in the jungle. Hopefully we haven't seen the last of Rocky Balboa, cause he still knows how to bring magic to the big screen."

","The uber villain from the Rocky franchises returns. Whoever watched the original Rocky movies will not forget Ivan Drago - also known as Dolph Lundgren in real life with an amazing performance that is literally as 1 dimensional as possible and still or rather because of that is in one of the best Rocky movies made. So it makes sense for him to return here and to reprise his iconic role, training his son to take on Creed.<br/><br/>Dumbing down again (evil as evil can be), he brings gravitas to the movie. Which does not quite reach the heights of the first Creed, but still is quite enjoyable. Especially with all the history contained in the movie.

I said lots of bad things about it. So, is it not worthy to see it? Not, it is worthy to see it in a theatre or buying its blu ray for sure. It is better then some Rocky movies for me, including 3 and 4. Also, cast did a great job. Micheal B. Jordan, Sly Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Dolph Lundgren, Florian Munteanu... They all were amazing. It was a great experience to see Ivan Drago again in a different situation, facing with Rocky again, seeing his background story after the events of Rocky 4, his relationships with his son and wife... About Viktor, he is a better villian than Conlan in first Creed. But he couldn't be the greatest Drago. His father was more scaring and bigger than him. And their fight with Adonis was not so intense and brutal. But Adonis was still on fire, he was great. On the other hand Creed II is our last time to see Stallone as Rocky. This is so dramatic. Oh, final sequence was so dramatic too. It was a great ending."

So when Creed 2 was announced, that whole ""here we go again"" response kinda happened one more time. Especially considering it was picking back up the whole Drago/Creed story once more... surely this time it won't answer the 10 count, right?
Wrong!
What's actually happened is we've got what is probably a contender for the 2nd best movie of the Rocky franchise! Creed 2 follows in the same footsteps of its predecessor in style and substance. Although the main story was slightly predictable, which you could gather from the trailers. It still throws in a few little twists here and there.
What made this movie so great however, was the way it seemed to sign off (if it wanted to). It felt like we had gotten closure. I got a little emotional I'm not gonna lie."

"jon.h.ochiai","8","19","32","25 November 2018"," What We Love...
","In ""Creed II"" elder noble Sylvester Stallone reprises as legendary Rocky Balboa. Rocky asks Adonis ""Donnie"" Creed, played by amazing Michael B. Jordan, ""What are you fighting for?"" World Heavyweight Champion Donne was physically massacred in a previous fight with 6' 5"", 245 pound 'beast' Viktor Drago, played by real-life German boxer Florian Munteanu, son of Ivan Drago, surprising Dolph Lundgren.<br/><br/>Recall from ""Rocky IV"" Ivan killed Adonis's Father Apollo Creed in an exhibition boxing match that Rocky declined. Rocky could have saved his best friend Apollo by stopping the fight, but he didn't. That haunted Rocky for the last 33 years. In ""Rocky IV"" Rocky traveled to Moscow to fight Ivan to avenge Apollo's death. He knocks out Ivan in the final round. Steroid juiced Ivan was supposed to be the ""perfect"" fighter. Perhaps, not. This all happened before Adonis was even born. In the past.<br/><br/>So what is Donne fighting for? Director Steven Caple Jr. creates Donnie's journey in ""Creed II"" with less poignancy and clarity than the original ""Creed"". Steven replaced Ryan Coogler as director with somewhat lesser human transparency. Yet, ""Creed II"" is good enough. ""Creed II"" is the compelling narrative of the 'Sins of the Fathers'. In a touching moment in Rocky's restaurant ""Adrian's"" Ivan confronts Rocky for the first time since they fought.<br/><br/>Granite-like Dolph as Ivan commands subtle gravitas. He says to Rocky, ""Because of you, I lost everything."" When Ivan lost to Rocky he plummeted from virtual paragon to social outcast in Ukraine. His wife left both him and his son Viktor. All Viktor knows is fighting. He was ""raised in hate"" by Ivan. We witness their ""tough love"" relationship as the movie opens as Ivan chastises Viktor to run faster while driving in his van. They both have something to prove.<br/><br/>That volatile Father-Son dynamic is the realistic anchor of Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor's screenplay. Sly and Juel might have intended for more Shakespearean, but the narrative is too broad and unfocused. In ""Creed"" I was in tears as Donnie tells Rocky not to stop his fight. He still had something to prove: ""That I'm not a mistake."" In ""Creed II"" Rocky has become the Father, Donnie needed. However, Rocky is incomplete in his own relationship with his son Robert, played by Milo Ventimiglia.<br/><br/>Donnie must reconcile his late father Apollo's legacy, a man he never knew. Totally chiseled Michael B. inspires authentic suffering and vulnerability as Donnie seeks to discover himself. The boxing scenes in ""Creed II"" are visually astounding. Michael gained 20 pounds of muscle and along with Florian trained intensely for months.<br/><br/>Where the fights in ""Creed"" had an authentic realism, ""Creed II"" is more theatrical in the shear speed and power displayed on screen. The traded blows make you wince. That visceral emotion comes across in the first fight. Donnie is the valiant champion, who is truly afraid. Viktor is bigger, faster, and stronger. How can he win?<br/><br/>It's in the life outside the ring that redeems and transcends ""Creed II"". In the whimsical scene after Donnie wins the Heavyweight Championship, he asks his ""Unc"" for advice in proposing to Bianca, radiantly beautiful Tessa Thompson. Bianca is Donnie's longtime girlfriend, the gifted singer-composer gradually losing her hearing to a degenerative disease. Rocky tells Donnie to forget what's in your head, go with what's in your heart. When ""Creed II"" shows its heart as Michael B cries watching the diagnostic monitor in the hospital, it reminds that humanity and family worth fighting for.<br/><br/>Michael B eloquently defines the Hero in his courageous acts and in the power of his tears. He and Dolph discover the forgiveness in our sins of the past. Michael empowers ""Creed II"": Life is about the passion of what we love, whether we win or lose.

","I've always been a huge Rocky fan, and I mean HUGE. Seen the movies countless of times. I thought the first Creed was ok, it wasn't necessary but I was just happy they tried to continue the Rocky arc, and the execution was ok.<br/><br/>This movie is a whole different story. It felt very forced, which is understandable since it came out only 3 years after its predecessor. There's absolutely nothing to like about the protagonist Adonis Creed. He has this entitled, emotionless aura around him. And at times he just looks like a fool without life experience trying to follow in his fathers footsteps. Of course he has a kid.. how predictable. And of course Mary Anne Creed doesn't want Adonis to fight Viktor. So the story felt like it was written by a kid. The way Adonis talks to Rocky is really disrespectful too. And why is Michael B. Jordans acting so bad in this one? Never liked Bianca either, it just didn't feel like she's supposed to be in the Rocky franchise, she's quiet boring. I guess she's supposed to be tough, but she comes of as annoying. He's your stereotypical weak man who can't live without a girlfriend (oh Hollywood LOVES to depict them). And she's your typical feminist know-it-all gal who brings zero to the table. The hip hop music doesn't add anything of worth to the movie either, but rather made it feel even more like a B-movie.<br/><br/>I must admit, the Viktor Drago story was pretty interesting, and I felt sympathetic for him and his father. I was hoping he'd win in the end. A handsome struggling fighter with a tough upbringing. He felt far more realistic than Adonis with his predictable background.<br/><br/>All of Sly's scenes were good, he's such a legend and a kind person, it's hard to dislike him, even in a bad movie.
Personally the last 3 minutes were the best in the entire film. See for yourself which scene that is."

I had goosebumps the entire final fight due to my adrenaline levels being so high. The movie exceeded my expectations by a long shot, and here's why.<br/><br/>The movie is not only extremely fun, but also smart. The final fight is built up throughout the entire film, and the payoff is extremely satisfying. The color grading is intelligent as well, as it uses blues and greys in Drago's scenes to show how harsh and cold his environment is, while using oranges and browns in Creed's scenes to show how warm and comfortable his is. Also, the movie expresses emotions and feelings that the characters have so well that the audience feels everything that they see.<br/><br/>The ending to this movie is spectacular. Your adrenaline will be at its highest peak from start to finish.

","Creed II is not a bad film, but you have seen it before. Creed II is a combo of Rocky III and Rocky IV. Just about every single scene is taken from the two Rocky movies. Creed wants to fight Drago, but Rocky does not think that he can win because Drago is hungry - Rocky wants to fight Clubber Lang, but Mickey thinks he cannot win because Clubber is hungry. Creed loses to Drago and then hesitates to fight again and has confidence problems - Rocky loses to Lang and has confidence problems. Rocky gives Creed the speak that gets him to admit his fears - Adrianne gives Rocky the talk to get him to speak his fears. Creed changes his boxing style to fight Drago - Rocky changes his boxing style to fight Lang. Creed goes to a new training facility that is tougher than his previous one - Rocky goes to a new training facility.
While it was a fun movie to watch - there was nothing original. It was Rocky III with some sprinkling of Rocky IV all over with a new boxer."
"thebricks","1","45","92","24 November 2018"," All the Rockys are the same movie, mix it up for once; terrible!
","You know a movie is bad when you can predict the plot from start to finish. If you had to ask someone to write down the plot of this film with the sole guideline that it not be edgy, this is what you would get from most people. It basically was a remake of the Rocky with Drago without Apollo Creed dying. Whoever wrote the script for this movie should be ashamed of themselves. There was zero attempt to be original, zero attempt to make the film nuanced, zero attempt to develop characters. The Ukrainians/Russians were the worst. This is 2018, not the eighties. It felt like the Soviet Union never fell in this movie.<br/><br/>I didn't like the Drago subplot specifically. It was beyond lazy. There was no point bringing Drago's ex-wife back. Develop the character if you're going to do that, don't just put her in the movie without a good reason for her to be there. We're also meant to assume Drago's dad was completely shunned by everyone after the first movie, which just wouldn't have happened. There was no rematch? He didn't continue his career? He didn't move to Little Odessa, NYC, join the mob, train fighters? London? Come on. His mom just gave the younger Drago up, apparently?<br/><br/>One last thing, Michael B. Jordan was the weak point of this movie. It's official, he can't act. His performance in this film was embarrassing. It had to be said. He used to try before, but now it seems like fame has gotten to his head. I wouldn't be disappointed if Creed was recast for the third movie. TBH, I'd rather see a proper film about Drago and his son, just with a better actor. There's more of a story there than with Adonis Creed.<br/><br/>Can't recommend. Don't even bother on video, it's that bad. The audience at my showing loved the movie and even clapped, but they must have never seen a Rocky movie before because it basically was a carbon copy. A shameless one."
"confrank","8","9","14","24 November 2018"," A very worthy sequel to Creed, and surprisingly deep for a Rocky IV follow-up
","The one fight I was excited for this year more than Khabib vs. McGregor. Creed makes a triumphant return with nearly the same fireball energy of the first. I won't lie and say this film astounds you with a new and innovative spin on the main formula: the biggest twist in the film is that Dolph Lundgren CAN ACT?! Who knew? A lot of the over the top showmanship and bravado of Rocky IV makes a familiar return along with the Dragos, but the film makes a much more powerful impression with vastly superior acting and directing. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Michael B. Jordan is an absolute star and I could see him in just about anything. The subtraction of all that Cold War propaganda bullshit doesn't hurt either.<br/><br/>One of my biggest weaknesses a film can exploit is by having an epic training montage. This film has multiple and I was practically bursting out of my seat to drive straight to my gym as they pumped up my blood pressure to some moderately dangerous levels. Really all I wanted from Creed II was to revel in the excitement of drama and intensity cranked up to the max while feeling every hard hitting punch it threw. Thanks to the emotion oozing out of almost every scene, that's precisely what I got."

","3 years ago when Creed was released I was hoping that it wouldn't ruin how Sylvester Stallone had presumably said goodbye to his beloved character in ROCKY BALBOA. Thankfully, I was proven wrong. Not only did it meet low expectations, it exceeded them with flying colors. It didn't reinvent the Rocky formula but it gave it much needed shot in the arm
Ryan Coogler created a film that could stand on it's own, but fit perfectly into the Rocky universe.<br/><br/>Now comes Creed II. It is a tad less effective than Creed but it is better than most of the Rocky sequels. It again respects the formula but is grounded by a very good performances by the cast but especially Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed. Both Creed films belong to him, as they should. He is a terrific actor. Sylvester Stallone wrote this sequel but makes the great decision to keep the story about Adonis, but Rocky plays a important role.<br/><br/>I hate giving spoilers but most people already k om that Creed II is about Adonis being challenged to fight the son of Ivan Drago, the man who killed Apollo in ROCKY IV. Dolph Lundgren is back as Ivan and gives I believe as good as a performance as he can as a bitter man that lost everything after losing to Rocky. He is training his son Viktor to be the champion he failed to be. All of this is fairly predictable but this time the script gives Ivan Drago some humanity that was not at all present in ROCKY IV. Obviously, Adonis takes the fight feeling that he has to. He has still not been able to construct a legacy that his father had left. He asks his girlfriend Bianca to marry him and shortly after the marry they find out that she is pregnant. The chemistry between Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson that was so good in the first film is again present here. The great thing about the first CREED was that the quiet, more character driven scenes made the film better. That is the case again even though this sequel is more formulaic. Sylvester Stallone proves again here that he is capable of bringing something to his Rocky character that had been lost in most of the previous sequels. He plays him with wisdom but also with regret.<br/><br/>All of this of course comes with the obligatory fight and training sequences which are done very well again. They are not as showy as the other sequels but because we care about Adonis they are really effective. Like Ryan Coogler before him, director Stephen Caple Jr. puts a lot of emphasis on his characters as well as the fight sequences. If there is a misstep in Creed II is a cameo by Bridget Nielsen as Ludmilla, Ivan Drago's wife that had left him and their son due to his failure. She appears at a victory dinner for her son and comes to the final fight only to leave her son again. But, that is my only complaint. Creed II is certainly predictable lwhen it comes to the final fight, but ends on a poignant note with both Adonis and Rocky. This film is what it is, a very good sequel to a great film."

The family aspect of the movie felt absolutely natural and fit perfectly with the film's flow. The father/son relationships were brilliant.

"Bertaut","6","17","31","15 December 2018"," Decent enough, but adheres too rigidly to the Rocky template
","<a href=""/title/tt3076658/"">Creed (2015)</a> was probably the best of the remakequels (ostensible sequels that are, for all intents and purposes, remakes) that came out in the mid-2010s, and was the first Rocky film not written by <a href=""/name/nm0000230/"">Sylvester Stallone</a>, and not directed by either Stallone or <a href=""/name/nm0000814/"">John G. Avildsen</a>. After <a href=""/title/tt0479143/"">Rocky Balboa (2006)</a> did the seemingly impossible, redeeming and concluding the franchise after the damage done by <a href=""/title/tt0100507/"">Rocky V (1990)</a>, Creed did something even more unlikely - revitalising the franchise with Rocky himself as a supporting character. For the sequel, Stallone is back as a writer (sharing credit with <a href=""/name/nm3541432/"">Juel Taylor</a>, from a story by <a href=""/name/nm0672011/"">Sascha Penn</a> and <a href=""/name/nm1854539/"">Cheo Hodari Coker</a>), with <a href=""/name/nm4023702/"">Steven Caple Jr.</a> directing. Whereas Creed was essentially a remake of the original <a href=""/title/tt0075148/"">Rocky (1976)</a>, Creed II is more of a combination of <a href=""/title/tt0084602/"">Rocky III (1982)</a> and <a href=""/title/tt0089927/"">Rocky IV (1985)</a>, with some elements from <a href=""/title/tt0079817/"">Rocky II (1979)</a>, and whilst it hits all the beats one expects from a Rocky movie, the problem is that it hits them so slavishly, and does little else. It also, perhaps inevitably, suffers badly in comparison to its predecessor, especially in terms of direction - whereas <a href=""/name/nm3363032/"">Ryan Coogler</a>'s directorial work was assured, distinctive, and inventive, Caple Jr.'s is pedestrian and functional. Had it strayed from the formula just a tad, the way Creed did, the way Rocky Balboa did, it would have been a much better film. The kernel for a terrific film is there, but the execution is not; it features a litany of clichés; it's dull and repetitive; and the antagonist's subplot is infinitely more compelling than the main plot.<br/><br/>In Rocky IV, former WBC Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (<a href=""/name/nm0001835/"">Carl Weathers</a>) was killed in the ring during an exhibition bout against Ivan Drago (<a href=""/name/nm0000185/"">Dolph Lundgren</a>). Determined to avenge the loss of his best friend, reigning champion Rocky Balboa (<a href=""/name/nm0000230/"">Sylvester Stallone</a>) travelled to Moscow, where he defeated Drago. 33 years later, Ivan's son, Viktor (the man-mountain that is (<a href=""/name/nm8108730/"">Florian Munteanu</a>), is training as a professional boxer in Ukraine. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, three years after his professional debut, Apollo's son, Adonis (<a href=""/name/nm0430107/"">Michael B. Jordan</a>), is preparing for a championship bout. Upon winning the title, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor (<a href=""/name/nm1935086/"">Tessa Thompson</a>), who says yes. Life seems perfect. That is until Viktor and Ivan head to the US and issue a very public challenge.<br/><br/>From an aesthetic point of view, Creed II is largely unremarkable (there's certainly nothing as epic as the single-shot fight from the first film), but one aspect that did stand out is the sound. As the first film established, Bianca is losing her hearing, something which is manifested in the aural design of Creed II several times. At the start of the film, for example, as Bianca walks through the backstage area prior to the title fight, the sound of the crowd is soft and distanced until she puts in her hearing aid. Later, when Adonis is training in a swimming pool, Bianca and his mother, Mary Anne (<a href=""/name/nm0711118/"">Phylicia Rashad</a>), are talking at another location, with their conversation carrying over his scenes. However, every time he goes below the water, the sound of their voices dulls as if it were diegetic. When Adonis is knocked down during his bout with Viktor, all sound is pulled from the film, only returning when he locks eyes with Bianca in the crowd. Even Adonis's marriage proposal involves her hearing aid.<br/><br/>Thematically, legacy is a huge issue in Creed II, particularly as it relates to fathers and sons - most notably Apollo and Adonis, and Ivan and Viktor. Rocky himself is something of a surrogate father to Adonis, and is estranged from his own son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia), and a grandson he has never met. Whilst Creed saw Adonis use boxing as a way to symbolically bond with a father he never knew, Creed II is more concerned with the emotionally fraught terrain that can result when fathers try to live vicariously through their sons, and when sons must live with their father's failures. Everything Viktor does, for example, is an attempt to earn Ivan's approval, whilst Ivan sees Viktor as the only way to atone for what happened to him after losing to Rocky.<br/><br/>Indeed, the depiction of the Dragos in general is especially interesting, and is both one of the best aspects of the film, and one of the most problematic. In Rocky IV, Ivan was a cartoon villain, a badly written, pseudo-xenophobic hyperbole of what some Americans seemed to think Soviets were like. He was barely one-dimensional. In Creed II, he's still relatively thin as a character, but Lundgren is given enough room to portray him as essentially broken, living on nothing but bitterness, resentment, and shame. When he meets up with Rocky in the latter's restaurant, promising, ""my son will break your boy"", he comes across as more pathetic than anything else, a million miles from the almost automaton-like warrior of three decades prior. When Ivan mentions their fight, Rocky tries to dismiss it, ""that's like a million years ago."" Ivan, however, replies, ""but just yesterday to me."" One gets the impression that from the moment of his loss he's been waiting for this, seeing his son as nothing more than the delivery method of his vengeance. Ivan has raised Viktor in pure hate, teaching him that the only thing that matters is winning, but you can see in every move that Viktor is far more concerned with earning his father's respect - winning as an end unto itself means relatively little to him. There's a lot of pathos in that, and both Lundgren and Munteanu act the hell out of the complex dynamic. Working with Stallone for the fifth time, Lundgren's understated and subtle performance is easily the best of his career, and the best in the film, with the quietness that spoke to lack of interiority in the previous film, here suggesting a deeply felt pain.<br/><br/>The training montages also do something very interesting in respect to Viktor. Showing him jogging through economically impoverished communities, stacking crates, lugging around bags of cement, and working with less than state-of-the-art equipment, the parallel is not to Ivan, who trained with hi-tech gizmos and gadgets in Rocky IV, but to Rocky's training in the original film. Indeed, whilst Adonis lives in a luxury apartment, Viktor and Ivan live in a dingy bedsit in Ukraine that recalls Rocky's original digs in Philadelphia.<br/><br/>The problem with all of this is that the Dragos' story is by far the most compelling one in the film. One should not come away from a film named Creed II wishing there had been less Creed and more of the antagonists. Set against the complex and fascinating Drago family drama, Creed and Bianca's story is pretty insipid. The most dramatic and heartfelt moments of the film involve Ivan and Viktor, and the long middle section where Creed falls into a depression seems to go on forever; the whole time we were watching him fall apart, I was yearning to get back to the Dragos.<br/><br/>And this feeds into the film's most egregious problems - its rigid adhesion to the Rocky template, and the concomitant predictability. Chances are that everything you think might happen in Creed II does, as the film makes no attempt whatsoever to be original. Aside from the Drago subplot, there is nothing here that we haven't seen before. Granted, the Rocky franchise has always tended to wear its predictability like a badge of honour, and the core template does undoubtedly work. But even when a film adheres to that template, one shouldn't be able to predict each narrative beat with near perfect accuracy. Even Rocky V, as awful as it was, tried something new, culminating with a street fight rather than an in-ring bout. It didn't even remotely work, but the thinking behind it was admirable. Aside from two unexpected cameos, Creed II never once caught me off-guard, doing nothing original, unexpected, or in any way daring. And because of that, for large portions of the runtime, particularly the middle section, the film is interminably boring.<br/><br/>Even the boxing itself is not especially well-done. <a href=""/name/nm0605190/"">Kramer Morgenthau</a>'s cinematography is fine, but nothing special, and pales in comparison to <a href=""/name/nm0016662/"">Maryse Alberti</a>'s work in the first film. Aside from <a href=""/title/tt0081398/"">Raging Bull (1980)</a> and <a href=""/title/tt0248667/"">Ali (2001)</a>, both visually unique in their own ways, Creed is arguably the most technically proficient boxing movie in terms of in-ring competition. Creed II, however, shoots all the fights very conventionally, holding a fairly uniform three-quarters distance from the actors, with Caple Jr.'s only trick seeming to be slow-motion, which he grossly over-uses. This has the effect of making the fights seem repetitive, even when the story being told is different (which isn't helped by the fact that Ivan tells Viktor to ""break him"" about 153 times).<br/><br/>Although there are some laudable elements here, Creed II is a disappointment in almost every way, from the dull and soulless domestic scenes to a dénouement that goes beyond suspension-of-disbelief, with not a hint of unpredictability. By deconstructing the Rocky template, Creed found its way to unexpected thematic depths, whereas Creed II exists entirely on the surface. Sure, the Rocky melodrama is there, the Rocky fights are there, the Stallone one-liners are there, but with a narrative focused almost entirely on the less interesting characters, this has to go down as a missed opportunity. Apart from the Drago subplot, everything is by-the-numbers. Yes, we care about these characters, but that's primarily because of the previous films, and whereas Creed forged a path very much its own, Creed II returns us to the safety of the overly familiar."

Also, I've seen a lot of people, complaining about the Dragos and their story in this film. I loved it and personally would love either a stand-alone Drago movie or for them to become more involved in a possible follow up in the growing Creed franchise. Most of the emotion in this film came from the Dragos and they hardly spoke but you could read the story they were writing with their expressions which is beautiful and says a lot of the skill of acting by those two. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, literally everything, the story, the music, the fights, and the acting. I highly recommend this film and am disappointed in my self of how long it took me to watch it but am glad I did."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","4","5","7 December 2018"," Creed II packs a punch and retains its heavyweight champion belt.
","The 'Rocky' franchise has spanned many decades, bolstering brutal fist fights and acclaimed scenes of cinematic showmanship. Much like its predecessor, this sequel eloquently balances the personal life of Adonis Creed and the exhilarating boxing matches, creating a film that feels more like a personal journey. A conquest in creating a legacy. Creed is now the heavyweight champion of the world, in which the infamous Russian boxer Ivan Drago let's his son challenge Creed, making for his most personal fight yet. Boxing films and most sports films in general are predictable. They follow a formula. Yes, this sequel is over reliant on said formula and loses the freshness of Coogler's previous entry, which remains superior. However, this is such an assured and solidly made film that I just couldn't help but sit there and get myself involved. A low blow to the rib cage? I punched the person sitting next to me. Struggling to get back up? I'm on the edge of my seat muttering ""come on! Get up!"". It's infectiously entertaining, and the reason for that is due to the astute focus on Creed as a character. His burning desire for Bianca as they start a family. His thirst for redeeming his father's name after Ivan killed him in the ring. Not only is he wanting to leave a legacy in the sports world, but also in his own personal world. Stallone's script and Caple's directing allowed an adequate balance of this, enabling every punch thrown to be of the utmost importance. And my God do you feel them! Jordan is a tank, and clearly all those months of training have been worth it. But Munteanu, a professional boxer, is an absolute machine. A beast of juggernaut proportions. Highlighting the ""David vs Goliath"" scenario that Creed must face head on. Performances were excellent all round, particularly Stallone, Jordan and Thompson. Lundgren reprises his role and actually does a decent job, establishing a delicate father and son relationship. Also, that final match made me sweat, profusely might I add.

","Greetings again from the darkness. The theatre was packed and I don't recall having heard a louder outburst of cheering for any movie moment. Was it predictable? Yes. Did it deliver what the fans wanted? Absolutely. Is it (as my son asked) ""ROCKY IV in 4K?"" Yes, that's pretty much exactly what it is. So despite CREED (2015) director Ryan Coogler opting to make BLACK PANTHER instead of this sequel to his own movie, I've seen proof that it's clearly a crowd-pleaser ... which is what the ""Rocky"" franchise has always done best.<br/><br/>Michael B Jordan returns as Adonis Johnson/Creed and Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky Balboa. And although that would likely be enough, we also have Tessa Thompson as Adonis' girlfriend Bianca and Phylicia Rashad as Adonis' mom, both also from CREED. We see an early training/boxing sequence in Russia featuring (professional boxer and chiseled human mountain) Florian Munteanu as Viktor Drago being trained by his father Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). If you are a fan of the franchise at all, you know exactly where this is headed - and so does opportunistic boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle (Russell Hornsby).<br/><br/>Think of it as 'Revenge vs Redemption'. Adonis fighting the son of the man who killed his father Apollo is the obvious revenge side, and Viktor fighting to redeem his disgraced father Ivan, who lost to Rocky 30 some years ago. This one lacks the real world Cold War element of ROCKY IV (1985), and while it's missing the political heft of that film, it still packs quite a punch as a revenge flick ... even if there was no other possible route this sequel could take. If anything, the filmmakers should be commended for not force-feeding any cheesy political statements on today's environment.<br/><br/>""What are you fighting for?"" This must be both a necessary boxing question to answer and a tough one, as it seems to get asked over and over during the film. The combination of writers: story by Cheo Hodari and Sacha Penn, characters by Ryan Coogler, and screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor, place quite a bit of focus outside the ring. Relationship quandaries are at every turn: young married couples, father-son (double whammy), mother-son (another double whammy), and first time parents.<br/><br/>Director Steve Caple Jr seems more comfortable outside the ring himself, as the boxing match camera work does not hit the level of the first, although audience members' emotions run even higher. Perhaps to overcompensate for the more basic camera work, some of the sound effects for rib punches may have been pulled right out of battle scenes in war movies - they sound like explosions, and are exaggerated so that we viewers might ""feel"" the ribs cracking.<br/><br/>Wisely the relationship between Adonis and Bianca is a key element this time. Mr. Jordan and Ms. Thompson have tremendous chemistry, and the filmmakers deserve credit for hitting the hearing-impaired issue head-on. It's a topic that's rarely seen in movies, and appears to be very well handled. There are some other ties to the ""Rocky"" franchise with Wood Harris playing ""Little Duke"", son of Duke, played numerous times by Tony Burton throughout the Rocky films, and there are a couple of other (very) familiar faces that pop up from both IV and ROCKY BALBOA (2006). On the music front, Ludwig Goransson is a rising star composer thanks to FRUITVALE STATION, CREED, BLACK PANTHER, VENOM, and now CREED II. He toys with the familiar Rocky numbers, but some will argue not enough.<br/><br/>This sequel is more grand scale than the first (which was identity driven), yet more restrained than IV. Sure we have the mandatory zany training montage (zany may be too mild), and the final bout is held in Moscow (even though it makes no sense that the champion would agree to this), but it's definitely more low-key when comparing Bianca's musical intro to James Brown's ""Living in America"".<br/><br/>For fans, it's great to see Rocky Balboa and Ivan Drago back in the ring together - even if only for a moment; however, maybe not as thrilling (dramatically speaking) as when the two first reunite Godfather-style in a table at Adrian's Café. It's a surreal moment that both Lundgren and Stallone play perfectly - one with pent-up emotional turmoil and the other quite content with what life has delivered. Of course, Sly can play Rocky in his sleep ... and no that wasn't meant to encourage one-liners followed by rim shots. He's comfortable with the shuffles and mumbles of an elderly Rocky and it's a pleasure to watch an old friend. The only real question remaining ... is the ""Creed"" franchise gonna fly now?"
"Rageypoo","1","15","27","16 February 2019"," A heavy hitter with weak acting
","I want to start by saying I love the Rocky franchise. I think Stallone is a fantastic writer and director and I think he did a spectacular job in this film despite what he had to work with.<br/><br/>The story has a powerful premise that is completely missed by the acting. Instead of this being about Apollo Creed, and the death at the hands of Drago, that should have sparked a bitter rivalry between their sons...there was almost zero tension between them. What we got was a very small glimpse into the life of Drago's son, and Drago himself, and a bland story about Creed's son and his girlfriend and having a baby with some hearing issues to try and pull at heart strings. Basically all the growing up Adonis did in the first Creed is completely out the window so he can fight Drago's son, and his reasons for wanting it are completely unrealistic, it's not like he knew his dad so there's no hatred or revenge for what happened, like at all.<br/><br/>This is nothing like the original Rocky series, not at all. This was barely memorable and I'll be honest, I don't even remember half of the characters names from this movie because they're so forgetable. Creed was full of character, rocky was too, so was mickey and even adrian and paulie. There was just nothing there!<br/><br/>I also want to mention how weak the boxing scenes were. In rocky you can tell the punches were really far away and telegraphed, but the actors did such an amazing job at making it look and feel real specially in the second movie and beyond. You can tell Jordan is not a fighter, at all. Drago's son looked the part and it seemed like he was probably a fighter, but it was completely eclipsed by Jordan's lack of skill and believablitiy.<br/><br/>Overall this movie really surprises me with the high rating reviews. I wasn't impressed with the first movie either because of how weak Jordan's acting is, I think Creed deserved a better actor in honor of Carl Weathers and his brilliant performance. This movie just made me want to watch rocky again and forget it even exists.<br/><br/>This movie SHOULD have been better, but it falls flat."
"xmike-25541","4","15","27","12 February 2019"," Dumbest Boxer fighter in boxing movies universe
","Really ? 7.6 ? For what ? Only person who acts like sane or normal person is balboa.. Creed could be stubborn and it would be ok with me. But he is just dumb, spoiled, arrogant prick, who gives a f** about rocky and disrespects him two times with really ugly way.. Too bad that writters or producers didnt shape him like REAL Apollos´s son. It would be miles ahead better and nicer to watch. This Cred is unwatchable and unhearable person who cant even propose his girl. Biana is annoying, arrogant as well in final match, screaming like black teen same as Mayweathers daughter (vs McGregor). She screams to the crowd after first round like horny cow, really..Drago junior before EVERY move, talk or action looks at his father , seeking permission.. in way like, he would seeking permission even to take a pee. Story itself is predicatble from first second. What bothers me most is the desert period. Rocky inclining that Adonnis has to change his style but we dont get to know anything closer about that change, i mean, remember rocky or rocky 3 ? changes in boxing style were explained and well executed. Here ? nothing.. Bad movie with best old Rocky you can get. I really enjoyed watching Sly bcuz it wasnt cliche like in Rocky Balboa film.. He acted normal and naturaly."

"HollywoodJunket","10","15","27","24 November 2018"," Emotional Pull in CREED II
","It was three years ago that director Ryan Coogler brought us Creed which in that, brought fans an update of the life of legendary fictional boxer Rocky Balboa, the role that made iconic actor Sylvester Stallone an icon.<br/><br/>In Creed Stallone had taken young boxer Adonis Johnson (portrayed by Michael B. Jordan) under his wing as his trainer and mentor. In Creed 2 audiences will see Adonis strive to reach another level in boxing that was achieved by his deceased father Apollo Creed, and Rocky Balboa. Creed 2 takes us on his journey as Adonis battles personal conflicts to crack into his inner beast and higher self.<br/><br/>Creed 2 brings the characters full circle when Balboa is faced with an old Ukrainian challenger, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) when he pits his son Viktor Drago to avenge his boxing defeat by Balboa over thirty years ago.<br/><br/>We rejoin Adonis in his current life as a successful boxer having six consecutive boxing wins under his belt and recently crowned the Heavyweight Champion of the World. The upmost highest level and honor achievable by a boxer.
However, something still isn't right in Adonis' world. He seeks to find it and is certain that the answer rests in accepting the challenge laid upon him by Viktor Drago. Adonis gives boxing fans what they want ""the fight the whole world wants to see"" even against Balboa's warning due to his own experience when Ivan broke things inside of him that ""have never been fixed.""<br/><br/>Creed 2 this time directed by Steven Caple Jr. does a great job of keeping the heart and story from the original and seamlessly bringing audiences up-to-date with the same characters in their present day lives. The heart, the soul, and struggles of the characters are exposed making for emotional moments in the movie, as was also in the first. Audiences may catch themselves with a teary-eye here and there throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Actress Tessa Thompson, who plays Adonis' girlfriend Bianca, returns. As well as actress Phylicia Rashad as ""Mary Anne Creed"" mother of Adonis and widow of Apollo Creed. Not returning, as mentioned earlier, was director Ryan Coogler who directed Creed. Surprising since Stallone mentioned at a Q&A of a past screening of ""Creed"" that Coogler reminded him of himself.<br/><br/>Boxing fans will apreciate the realistic boxing scenes in Creed 2 along with the behind-the-scenes stuff that we don't get to see and hear. For example Creed 2 takes viewers inside of the ring to hear the dialogue shared between trainers and their boxers.<br/><br/>We can be sure that actor Michael B. Jordan who plays Adonis was roughend-up again in real life during his training for the movie. At the same Q&A Stallone stated that Jordan took some real punches for his role. Stallone recounted that Michael ""got so banged-up and knocked-out."" These gyms, Stallone stated, are very territorial and it's their turf. ""They don't want to look bad. So, they unleash on him (Michael)."" While real-life singer Tessa Thompson went to Philly and wrote her own songs to submerse herself in the role.
Creed 2 does a great job at honoring Rocky and fans will be able to connect well with it by enjoying the reconnecting of past character Ivan Drago to the modern-day threat Adonis Creed as he seeks his redemption through his son.<br/><br/>Creed 2 places Adonis on the ultimate boxing throne. However, he soon finds out that the real challenge is how to mantain his new found glory, and proving to himself and others that he is worthy. The outcome that happens because of that inner struggle is the driving force in Creed 2."
"kjproulx","9","20","38","30 November 2018"," A Rock-Solid Continuation to the Rock/Creed Legacy
","When it comes to the films in the Rocky franchise, you can pretty much predict how each film will end when the set-up takes place throughout the first act. This is both a positive and a negative that this franchise faces, due to the fact that the formula of these movies is about as perfect as you get when telling a story like this. When Creed hit theatres back in 2015, I was blown away in thinking that it was in the discussion of best films in the entire franchise. This was a tall order to follow in Creed II and while it doesn't quite hit every stride it needs to in order to be classified as one of the greats, I have very few complaints about this follow-up. This is the way you make a sequel.<br/><br/>Young Adonis Creed's past isn't all sunshine and rainbows. His father having been killed by Ivan Drago in the fourth installment has him hellbent on a revenge kick when confronted with the opportunity to fight the son of the man who has put so much pain into his life. While this premise may just seem like a way of pleasing fans of the cheesy sequels in the past, it really isn't that at all. While the boxing matches are worth the wait, the heart on both sides of the ring is present this time around. With new obstacles to face in his personal life, the arc that Adonis goes through here was fantastic in my opinion.<br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan continues to astound me when it comes to his performances on-screen. Even though he hasn't always been in award-worthy films, his performances have always been out of this world. Once again, he embodies this character with enough emotion and energy to carry this movie from start to finish. His chemistry with Tessa Thompson has carried over from the first film and even digs a little deeper this time around. Their relationship reaches new heights, as well as new lows here, which is very reminiscent of the way Rocky and Adrian were in the second Rocky movie. The emotional core to this overall story hasn't been lost and I loved every bit of drama as much as I loved the boxing matches, which were incredible as well.<br/><br/>After Ryan Coogler departed as both writer and director (having done the first film), I found myself slightly concerned that the first would become lightning in a bottle, but that's not the case. Placed in the hands of Sylvester Stallone to write and given to newcomer Steven Caple Jr. to direct made for a nearly superior sequel in my opinion. The flare of this character was brought to the screen in the first in a very captivating way and that's not exactly captured here, but further explored. Taking the characters you love and expanding them is what a sequel is meant to do and this one did that beautifully.<br/><br/>In the end, Creed II's only true weakness is the fact that it does feel formulaic at times. You can see where the film is headed most of the time, but that really doesn't take away from the fact that it's extremely effective. I found myself on the edge of my seat during the matches and in emotionally invested in the surprises throughout the course of the film. This truly does feel like the conclusion of certain chapters in this franchise, but I wouldn't mind seeing a third if it can be as well-done as these first two were. Creed II is a fantastic follow-up in my opinion and if you're a fan of this franchise, I highly recommend checking it out."

","This movie was executed excellently. It has good ties with not only creed but also rocky movies too. Micheal B Jordan killed it as usual and displayed great emotion. I was mind blown by this movie. I could tell what was going on in these characters minds because they make it clear through great acting. There's tons of excitement in all the fight scenes and especially the entrances blew me away.

"rodwhitt","9","14","25","22 November 2018"," Predictable, but with a bigger heart and everything you want in a Rocky film
","While this film is the eighth in the Rocky franchise, it is very predictable from start to finish. It is hard for the eighth film to do something completely different in a loved franchise and end up like...you know, Rocky 5. So this movie has a very modern take on what made the original Rocky's so beloved. Stallone also gives one of my favorite performances as Rocky, and Michael B. Jordan continues to impress on the screen.
What stands out about this movie the most is how much it focuses on family and loved ones. Creed II has arguably the biggest of all of the movies prior.
With everything fans love about the Rocky films, and the biggest heart of the franchise, Creed II is easily one of the best movies of the franchise, top 3 at least."

"ironhorse_iv","8","6","9","17 December 2018"," Ring the bell! It's time to step back into the ring for Creed 2. Is it worth watching? Yes, it is.
","This sport movie directed by Steven Caple Jr, came out, swinging, and it did not miss! Without spoiling the film written by Sylvester Stallone and Cheo Hodari Coker, too much, this motion picture was action packed from start to finish. It was a totally hit for me! I love every minute of it; even if this 'Rocky' spin-off film, still follows the same guidelines as any of the previous franchise films & the story mirrors 1985's 'Rocky IV', a little too much, by having Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) fight Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) yet again. This time under with their protégés Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) & Ivan Drago's son, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu). Like 2015's 'Creed', which in return, is a soft reboot of the first 'Rocky' movie that released in 1975. I didn't mind, too much of this eighth entry in the storied 'Rocky' film series and the second in the 'Creed' successions, being too similar to the fourth film in the franchise. While, all the familiar schmaltzy tropes & callbacks may make this somewhat of a predictable rethread. The movie did give us, some new material to work with. Some examples are the way, the film gave a lot of scenes of hardship to the villains, making them, a lot more sympathetic than any other antagonist, besides Adonis' father in the past. I glad that they're not robotic one dimensional meatheads. Honestly, to tell you, the truth, this sequel kinda fix, some of the problems, I had with the 2015 movie, as well. Some examples were the lack of resolve to Rocky's rocky relationship with his absence son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia). I'm glad that oddly, out of the blue, forced subplot finally got some closure, here. I'm also happy that the film gave Adonis's singer-songwriter love interest, Bianca (Tessa Thompson), a little more depth. The loss of her hearing subplot was very compelling. I just wish, the movie focus, a little more on how that loss was effecting her singer career as she is struggling to maintain it. Regardless, I like how the film shows how much this tragic, including the birth of his daughter has cause Adonis; to the point that he has to rethink his career choice. Can he still afford, being a good friend, husband & father figure, meanwhile still somewhat maintaining his self-driven attitude in a dangerous profession that could end his life? It's a challenging question that Adonis has to ask himself. Regardless, Jordan really does show great details of the boxer's struggles of trying to figure out, what he's really fighting for. He really put an outstanding performance. Not only that, but he has great on screen chemistry with all of his co-stars. I can really believe that his character really does love his family. Sylvester Stallone is also good. While, his character has less to do this time around, Stallone still excels at mentoring Creed and reminding him what's truly worth fighting for. I just hate that second half plot mandated friendship break, involving him and Creed. I found, the reasons for them to hate each other for a bit, very weak, and somewhat forced. Of course, also prediction, as they make up in time for the climax. As for Tessa Thompson, she does well within her limited role, keeping Adonis's growing ego in check, while also being a good wife & mother. Because of this, the audience really does root for Creed to win, because it will seem to be for nothing, if he doesn't. Not only that, but Jordan's boxing skills are pretty impressive. He really did put a lot of work in the gym, gaining 25 pounds of muscle to match the real life boxer, Florian who had to lose 20. Both of them, really put out a realistic intense match with their choreography. Not only that, but the way, this movie was shot was amazing. Kramer Morgenthau's cinematography was outstanding. Brutal, and grounded. The training montage here, was a lot more intense than the 2015 version. As for the background music that went with all, these amazing scenes. Composer, Ludwig Göransson did a hell of a good job. Despite, not being a huge hip hop fan, the score mixed with some rap vibes sounds really epic. It wasn't as annoying as I thought, it would. I also glad the movie didn't seem Blaxploitation. That would had been cheesy and cartoony. Never once, did I felt like I was watching a movie target to a certain audience. It felt like an every person movie. I'm also happy that the movie wasn't portray in a simpleton over patriot jingoism propaganda matter, as well. However, I kinda wish the film didn't make everybody from Eastern Europe seem like they had a blunt serious demeanor. It makes the film, a little bit stereotypical. The private dinner scene for the boxers is one such example. Russians are not that uptight, stern and cold. Despite that, I still dig the cameo of a certain familiar woman. Without spoiling it, that was fun to see. Nevertheless, it would also been awesome to see Geraldine Hughes return as Marie from 2006's 'Rocky Balboa', as well, as it seem that storyline never got finished. Hopefully, she can return back in the next film. Regardless, overall, 'Creed 2' goes the distance. It was a total knockout in all departments. A entertaining movie worth seeing."

Tessa Thompson's Bianca is once again lovable and she has great chemistry with Jordan's Adonis Creed.<br/><br/>My biggest surprise (in a good way) has to do with the character of Ivan Drago, portrayed by Dolph Lundgren, who continues to be my favorite antagonist in this franchise.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I gotta say that this movie has a great balance when connecting with the previous movies (mostly Rocky IV ofc) and doing its own thing and building its own future and legacy.<br/><br/>Rocky IV is my favorite movie of the franchise and I really wanted Creed II to succeed in everything I was expecting, but I was like ""eh, it will definitely be good, but maybe not that much"" and, damn, I got everything that I wanted and so much more.<br/><br/>What are you doing reading this review?

","I will just get this out of the way: If you are a fan of the Rocky series, you have nothing to fear. Creed II doesn't hit all of the highs on the original Creed but it's another crowd pleasing entry into the Rocky series.<br/><br/>Creed II picks up three years after the events of Creed, with Adonis riding high on personal and professional success. That is until he is challenged by Viktor Drago, the son of the man who killed his father. If you've seen a Rocky movie, or any boxing film, you can probably guess what happens next. Creed II hits familiar beats, but it hits them quite well. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br/><br/>Where this film really succeeds is in making Viktor seem like an unstoppable force, while also making him, and his father Ivan, sympathetic figures. Viktor is the best Rocky antagonist since his daddy over 30 years ago. Donny and Bianca's journey through the film is also very well handled, with Michael B. Jordan turning in another great performance.The character with the least to do here, surprisingly, is Rocky. That is probably where Coogler would have elevated the movie the most.<br/><br/>But what do we come to any Rocky/Creed movie for? Underdogs overcoming long odds. Catching up with characters we love. Training montages. Boxing matches that make you want to go out and fight someone. It's all here. Don't overthink it. Just enjoy it."

","Adonis Creed is heavyweight champion of the world. To defend his title, he accepts a challenge from someone with a very close connection to Creed: Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago, the man who killed Creed's father Apollo in the ring. Ivan is coaching his son and is determined to win the belt that Rocky took from him. Viktor Drago is unstoppable and Creed's odds against him are slim.<br/><br/>To my surprise, I enjoyed the first Creed movie. I was never a fan of the Rocky movies and I figured Creed was just going to be Rocky rebooted.<br/><br/>Turns out it was better than that. Rather than style over substance it had character depth and good plot development. The characters were engaging and the story was interesting.<br/><br/>Creed II continues in the same vein with an interesting plot and decently drawn characters. Maybe not as engaging as the first movie, but the intrigue of the David vs Goliath battle between Creed and Drago makes up for that.<br/><br/>Like the first Creed, this movie ties in with a Rocky storyline, so once again we have a refreshing of the Rocky story and a handing over to the new Rocky, Creed."
"MrPupkin","8","2","2","9 November 2019"," It is a solid movie that further cements Jordan as a star, and that's mostly because of how he portrays Donnie's personal development.
","A powerful sports drama, Creed II is extraordinarily compelling and full of thrills. After winning the heavyweight championship Adonis Creed is challenged by Viktor Drago, the son of the man who killed his father in the ring, and Adonis accepts, seeing a chance to right the past. Michael B. Jordan is excellent, giving perhaps his best performance yet, and Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren are also really good. And, the script does an impressive job at creating engaging character arcs and the fight scenes are incredibly intense and exciting. Creed II is a definite KO that ranks among the best in the franchise."
"damiandimitrov-68829","9","2","2","3 November 2019"," Incredible Emotional Journey
","Loved every second of it. Real story, with real challenges and real fighters. Drago was the perfect silent killer with his cold family. I expected nothing more. People moaning about character development don't know what the reality of sport and boxing is. Most of these elite athletes are killing machines hunting success. They don't show feelings and they ain't nice. As for Adonis he came back from the dead and showed great qualities as a father. Sick movie. Rocky got to spend some time with his most loved, on and off the ring."

","Seriously, Adonis has shown nothing but how needy and insecure he is. I didn't buy his change at all and really couldn't feel what was he supposedly fighting for in that last fight. Yeah he had a kid in a meantime, but he remained the same selfish brat.<br/><br/>Both Dragos were FAR more interesting. Victor being this kinda confused brute, and Ivan having an actual arc: from using his son and manipulating him for any cost to gain back the approval of the wife and Russia, to accepting that it's the son who is important to him now, and spending time training (running scene) with him back in Ukraine by the end.<br/><br/>If this was a setup for Drago spin-off then kudos, I'm interested!<br/><br/>Watching the dilemmas of Adonis I caught myself rolling my eyes twice or thrice, and I'm not the rolling-eyes type. I seriously feel the need now to watch a GOOD fighting movie now to see if I haven't lost it and just stopped liking these, because I just don't get all the praises this movie gets."
"wrightiswright","7","2","2","25 May 2019"," My Review
","All in all, probably as good as a movie with such a predicable worn-out plot could possibly be.<br/><br/>You know what to expect: Creed gets to big for his boots, loses his next fight, Rocky is on stand-by to give him some sage advice, blah blah blah... and then a million montages later, he defends his title, the triumphant music blasts out, everyone celebrates... Roll Credits.<br/><br/>Oh, and Rocky reconnects with his family, and Creed's wife has just had a baby. Got to give everyone the 'perfect' ending, right?<br/><br/>The boxing sequences are as usual the standout here, especially the final one. You'll actually feel like you're being pounded in the ring with the combatants... which believe me, is much more gratifying than it sounds.<br/><br/>It was also a stroke of genius bringing Dolph Lundgren back from Rocky III (a much inferior movie to this) providing a true rival to our leads as him and his son resurrect the ghosts of the past to cause angst in the present. Chilling.<br/><br/>Stallone is as charmingly dunderheaded as usual in the role of Rock Balboa he was born to play, Michael B Jordan as Creed is a moral fighter who it's very easy to root for... in fact everybody here acquits themselves well, the only problem being that we've seen this kind of stuff loads before and despite the many positives here, it still feels like the same old format warmed up a bit.<br/><br/>Still, I won't deny having enjoyed the experience. Just a little more innovation to the standard storyline would be nice next time... okay? 7/10"

"classicsoncall","8","2","2","3 May 2019"," ""If you wanna give pain, you gotta be willing to take the pain.""
","For me, ""Rocky IV"" was the low point for the movie franchise, being it was cobbled together with a bunch of scenes from the prior three movies, loaded up with a resounding soundtrack, and having what I consider some of the most cliched dialog you'll ever find in any film. Oddly, ""Creed II"" follows some of the same pattern as 'IV', but works in a much more effective way by delivering new takes on the boxing angles and providing a human dimension to Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and his relationship with wife Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Perhaps the most obvious similarity to ""Rocky IV"" was the desert training scenes that mimic Rocky's (Sylvester Stallone) intense preparation for the Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) match in the Russian countryside. That to be contrasted with Viktor Drago's more polished training regimen under the tutelage of his father, maybe not as technologically monitored as in the earlier film, but enough to demonstrate a contrast between the two fighters.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, it seemed to me like the actual fight scenes and the buildup to them were rushed in this picture. I had to watch the movie in two separate installments because of time constraints, so that might have affected my thinking. Given all the emotional significance attached to the importance of a Russian victory, both personal for Viktor and for the country's prestige, I thought it was out of character for Ivan Drago to end the match by the throwing in the towel for his son. However it did appear that Viktor's resolve to continue the fight crumbled when he noticed the empty arena seat vacated by his mother (Brigitte Nielsen), who left early rather than endure the despair of her son's defeat. That would also have played into his father's decision to end the bout.<br/><br/>Now that the Rocky franchise has spanned more than four decades since the original movie back in 1976, one would think it would be high time to call it quits, but I wouldn't bet on it. Adonis Creed is still the World Heavyweight Champ with additional challenges to face, and there's still that issue of baby daughter Amara's hearing left unresolved. That could have been successfully handled here, but if it can contribute to yet another sequel, then I guess, why not?"
"tonypeacock-1","7","2","2","26 March 2019"," Rocky IV.2 as much as Creed II
","Creed II or Rocky IV.2 carries on many of the familiar themes of the Rocky franchise, most notably the film Rocky IV from 1985.<br/><br/>Now many Rocky aficionados find Rocky IV the most entertaining of the original Rocky boxing franchise.<br/><br/>Creed II finds lead character Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) face the demons of his late father Apollo Creed when the son of his father's killer (in the boxing ring) Ivan Drago, Viktor Drago comes on the bocing scene.<br/><br/>Like Ivan in the 1980s, Viktor now is a biological freak when it comes to boxing. Bigger, more powerful than any other fighter in the world who threatens Adonis's worldwide domination of the 'sport'.<br/><br/>The reappearance of old characters such as Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) and Ludmilla Drago (Brigette Nielson) is entertaining.<br/><br/>The dialogue of some of the characters, in particular Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is sometimes difficult to decipher.<br/><br/>The film is pretty formulaic. Indeed I would call it Rocky IV.2 at times in scenes involving rematches, crying wives and training montages in the middle of nowhere.
Fans of the genre will not be left disappointed however I can't see the Creed franchise developing further? Could be wrong!"
"scott_starwalt","10","2","2","25 March 2019"," My personal opinion
","If you are truly a fan of the Rocky saga, then I believe you will be a fan of this one. I don't see how anyone wouldn't be entertained watching this movie. I have read reviews saying there were slow points but honestly, I enjoyed every minute of it. In my opinion, this movie is excellent!"
"margulanabutrlov","9","2","2","22 March 2019"," Creed II Review
","Against the wishes of cornerman Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson), new heavyweight champion of the world, Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), faces Russian Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), the son of Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), the man who killed Adonis' father.
Creed was that boxing ideal: a haymaker out of nowhere. Writer-director Ryan Coogler and star Michael B. Jordan took a practically moribund property and made it at once old-school and modern, deftly mixing full-blown romance with punishing pugilism, nuance and social awareness to stave off any potential triteness. Creed II, with Coogler only on executive producer duties, is sadly a lesser effort, full of programmatic plotting and on-the-bloodied-nose writing, but leavened by the chemistry of its stars and its commitment to the beats of the series.
The jumping-off point for the sequel is not Rocky II but Rocky IV, aka 'The One Where Rocky Grows A Beard, Chops Wood And Wins Over Moscow'. By 1985, Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed had been relegated to Sacrificial Sidekick Status, and it's his death at the hands of Ivan Drago that provides the engine for the new film. Under the tutelage of Ivan (Lundgren), Viktor Drago's (Munteanu) rise as a contender for Adonis' (Jordan) newly won heavyweight crown throws the young fighter into turmoil, as shown by endless scenes of him debating (with Rocky, Bianca, his mother) whether he should take the fight to avenge his father. To further compound his confusion, Adonis and Bianca (Thompson) are about to become parents, and have to face the prospect that the baby might inherit deafness from Bianca. The first film leaned into its more melodramatic elements. Here director Steven Caple Jr almost feels embarrassed by them, never letting the fears of the prospective parents register.
The big problem here is the writing. There's more speechifying this time (""Are you here to prove something to other people or prove something to yourself?"" barks Rocky (Stallone) at Apollo) and the exposition - often done through through TV punditry - lacks Coogler's economy and subtlety. While Creed made Adonis' life in Philadelphia authentic, Creed II doesn't bring telling specificity to Adonis' new world as a champ: it's just a tired litany of spacious apartments, lovemaking montages to R'n'B and interactions with the smallest entourage in boxing history. It's also a film that wears its subtext on its stars-and-stripes robe. ""It's Shakespearean!"" announces a ringside commentator, referring to the nexus of fathers, sons and tragedies in play. Creed II is Shakespearean minus the wit, profundity and emotional heft.
On the other side of the pond, Ivan and Viktor are given a thread of a through-line about trying to work their way back into the graces of the Russian boxing establishment. Although it's nice to see Stallone and Lundgren share the same frame again, Ivan and Viktor remain ciphers. Viktor, in particular, is granted all the complexity of a Brosnan-era Bond henchman.
Still there's pleasure to be had in spending time with these characters. Jordan and Stallone still retain their first film chemistry. Jordan and Thompson also still vibe, despite the latter being denied any inner life of her own. The film continues to find fun in all the Rocky staples. There are montages that cross-cut between Adonis and Viktor training - the former shadow boxing underwater, the latter doing impressive things with ropes - although sadly not to sub-rate synth music à la 1985. And Caple Jr mounts impressive fight sequences, using slow mo sparingly and a great use of POV shots - the light of the doctor's torch will stay with you. And it's a hard heart that doesn't respond to the impossible-to-resist button pushing - that music - in the enjoyably OTT boxing finale."

"Thanos_Karagioras","7","2","2","8 March 2019"," The story continues...
","""Creed II"" is a Drama - Sport movie and the sequel of ""Creed"" in which we watch Adonis Creed fighting not only for his title against Viktor Drago the son of Ivan Drago who killed his father but also for his respect. Rocky Balboa for one more time is the personal trainer of Adonis Creed as he was for his father Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>I liked this movie and I enjoyed it very much due to its connection not only with the previous Creed movie but also with the Rocky movies. The direction which was made by Steven Caple Jr. was simply amazing, with many good scenes which combined very well the power of the athletes and the pain they were feeling. He also combined very well the life of Adonis Creed outside the ring and his relationships with other people and how he was influenced by these relationships. Regarding the interpretations, I believe that for one more time Michael B. Jordan who played as Adonis Johnson - Creed was simply outstanding and his interpretation reminded his equally good interpretation in the first movie. Another very good interpretation was Sylvester Stallone's who played as Rocky Balboa and he was very good at his role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Dolph Lundgren's who played as Ivan Drago, Florian Munteanu who played as Viktor Drago and Tessa Thompson's who played as Bianca.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that ""Creed II"" is an amazing movie with many good scenes, plenty of action and some very good interpretations made by its cast. If you are a fan of the movies of Rocky and you enjoyed the previous movie ""Creed"" then I am sure that you are going to love this movie as well. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I believe that every person can gain something by watching it."
"XabisoM","8","2","2","8 March 2019"," Pretty Good but predictable
","Creed 2 does justice to its predecessor in raising the stakes and character development. Adonis still treats Rocky like trash though."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","2","2","8 March 2019"," An OK sequel that relies way too much on nostalgia.
","While I have only ever seen the original Rocky (1976) and the spinoff/reboot Creed (2015), I'm still aware of some of the details of the Rocky franchise as a whole. I know who some of Rocky Balboa's (Sylvester Stallone) opponents were over the years, including James ""Clubber"" Lang (Mr. T) and Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Consequently, even though Creed felt like it took the franchise in a new direction by focusing on Apollo Creed's (Carl Weathers) son, its sequel, Creed II (2018) felt too steeped in the franchise's history and nostalgia to be anything more than a rehash of Rocky IV (1985).<br/><br/>If anything, having Apollo Creed's son, Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), face off against Ivan Drago's son, Viktor (Florian Munteanu), as a revenge match that followed the same plot points as its predecessor smacks of lazy and clichéd writing. I would have been much more interested in this film if, even despite all the training each son endured, the outcome would have been different than before. Pulling out all the recognizable bits from past Rocky movies makes it seem like there's not many more rounds this franchise can go before falling to the mat.<br/><br/>I will applaud the filmmakers' restraint for not including that weird robot that was in Rocky IV, but a lot of the sentimentality and overly dramatic sub-plots seemed like they were trying too hard to get an emotional response from the audience. Fortunately, the boxing in this film looks brutal, a testament to both the choreography and training of the actors to make the fight seem so real. It's probably not anything more special than what Creed had in terms of cinematography, but if you're looking for a boxing match that doesn't require pay-per-view, this movie can fit the bill.<br/><br/>An OK sequel that relies way too much on nostalgia, I give Creed II 3.5 stars out of 5."

So I watched pretty much as a standalone movie.<br/><br/>What I didn't like were that some emotional scenes felt forced. Like it was dramatic for the sake of being dramatic. It didn't go with the flow of the movie. The other side is that more dramatic scenes were hits than misses. What I also didn't like was some of the decisions of the protagonist and the antagonist felt selfish considering the circumstances.<br/><br/>What I liked was that this movie had a lot of heartwarming moments because of great strength of character shown by the characters.

You have a standard script with a downfold in the middle and rise at the end but there was to many talking and scenes with didn't mean anything e.g. love scene at begining or a outside lamp scene . What really impressing is fighting quality and camera movement. Both main actors are really good trained. And main thing is father and son relationship at some point I had teardrop. What for dislikes is end music editing. If you using Rocky music so make it right. Wait for the moment and releasit what we have now is a simple soundtrack with no effect. And what is with rap music when black actor (no offensive) is main actor. With first Rocky films music was the background and it was strong.

This is a sequel to the 2015 Creed movie-which is a spin off of the Rocky movies-following the life of Michael/Adonis Creed, the son of Apollo Creed, from the Rocky movies. If you are a Rocky fan, you should enjoy this movie. Sylvester/Rocky Balboa is Michael's trainer. Tessa plays Michael's singer girlfriend that has a hearing problem. Michael is riding high since he became the world champ but Dolph/Ivan Drago puts a crimp in his celebration by challenging Michael to fight his son, Florian/Viktor Drago. If you remember from the Rocky movies, Dolph killed Michael's father in the ring so there is some bad blood between them. Even Sylvester is wary of the fight-wait until you see Florian and you will probably agree that it's not a good idea. The guy is huge. The fights are brutal and staged very well. There are a couple of cameos from people that were in previous Rocky movies.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sports action violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.

I liked the original Creed a lot. It was an idea that was just crazy enough to work, but don't expect the same from this one. Sorry, but those who like Creed II are too easy to please. The best part about it is Sly Stallone's excellent acting, unlike Michael B. Jorden who brings an unsympathetic and pouty quality to the role of Adonis Creed. Unfortunately, the commercial success of this movie will warrant a third installment. In Creed III, I say kill Rocky once and for all, have Adonis win a fight in his honor, and let's all move on and look to the future instead of trying to recapture the magic of cheesy 80s movies."

The music contained in the film is very much in accordance with the scenes in the film, thus adding more value to the film.<br/><br/>The characters featured in the film are very deep. When we watch the film we can see how the characters play the film to the fullest. As if we were not looking at a film, but seeing a life journey of a boxer who became a world champion.<br/><br/>This film basically shows about the feeling of struggle, pain, love, and family. Because the film shows that Adonis struggles to achieve his goals with the support and encouragement of the family, and a motivator named Rocky. Therefore, I recommend this film to be watched. Where the message to be conveyed in this film is do not be easily discouraged to achieve something, even though we have to bother first."

"olliethehut","10","4","6","28 July 2019"," The sequel Rocky 4 deserved
","Disclaimer - Yes, I'm a huge Rocky fan. And yes, Rocky 4 is my favorite of the original series.
Rocky films get a bad rap - naysayers will claim the fights are not realistic, the acting is questionable, the story lines are predictable and the outcomes too easy to predict. What so many reviewers fail to realise is that for the majority of us, these things dont really matter.
Creed 2 is in every way a Rocky film, and also in every way the best possible sequel to Rocky 4. It brings the story full circle, for fans of the series it has shout aloud moments of fandom, for those who just want a boxing film it has hero's and villains.
Its rare that I feel animated enough during a film to actually shout at the screen. For Creed 2 I was like Paulie at the conclusion of Rocky 4. Its not perfect (all it needed was a little Robert Tepper montage!) but as an up to date sequel it is excellent. 10/10 for the Rocky fans."
"iceman88869","5","4","6","14 February 2019"," Just ok
","This movie felt like a hallow shell of Rocky 1-4. I really felt there was no real climax. Nothing getting your blood flowing. If you have seen one Rocky movie, you know how everything is going to go. I will say Creed's girlfriend was not as irritating in this was as she was in the first Creed movie, but that is the only positive.<br/><br/>This movie is compared a lot to Rocky 4, which IMO is the best of the Rocky movies, but the only reason to compare it is because it has a lot of the same characters. Nothing more. When Creed trains, you don't get the sense that he is really getting any better. Rocky does not give him advice on how to beat Drago. He just trains him in a way that seems horribly weak compared to the way Rocky trained in Rocky 4. This is just a very shallow version of Rocky 4.<br/><br/>I seriously don't even think people know what a good movie is anymore with all of the horrible movies that come out these days. Me and those people rating this movie a 9 or 10 much have watched different moves."

","Three years after the events of Creed, Adonis Creed (Jordan) is at a career high. As the proud owner of the WBC World Heavyweight Championship title, Adonis has found himself in a worldwide spotlight. With his relationship with singer-songwriter Bianca (Thompson) going strong and Rocky (Stallone) in remission, Adonis prepares to leave Philadelphia behind in order to begin the next chapter of his life in Los Angeles. Shortly after taking ownership of the Heavyweight Championship title, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu) arrives on the scene with his father, Ivan (Dolph Lundgren), seeking a victory that will reclaim glory to the Drago name following Ivan's defeat by Rocky thirty years prior in Moscow. Fueled by hatred for his new rival, Adonis does not hesitate to go toe to toe with Ivan. Still guilt-ridden for what happened to Apollo in Rocky IV (1985), Rocky refuses to help train Adonis for the fear of history once again repeating itself. Adonis refuses to back down and moves forward in training without Rocky, unaware of the challenges that will push him to his limits.<br/><br/>Steven Caple Jr takes over directing reigns from Ryan Coogler here, but Creed 2 is no slump of a sequel. Creed 2 is a much more personal story than its predecessor as it follows Adonis desperately trying to prove himself in order to successfully continue his father's legacy. Michael B. Jordan is brilliant once again and provides strong depth for Adonis, portraying him as a much more complicated and troubled character this time around. Stallone (back on writing duties once again) proves that Rocky is his definitive role and is an exceptional screen presence as always. Although Rocky keeps to the side-lines here, the film dives further into his lingering guilt for not throwing in the towel during that pivotal moment during the Apollo V Drago fight, and we see how those troublesome memories cloud his judgement when Adonis expresses his desire to take on Viktor in the ring. As for the fight scenes themselves, they're brutal and shot ferociously. The final fight between Adonis and Viktor is one of the very best fights featured in the entire Rocky saga and easily matches the raw, nail-biting energy of Apollo's fight with Ivan in Rocky IV. What Creed 2 also does rather well is shine a light on the Drago family, making sure they are not portrayed as one dimensional antagonists. The film takes the time to give them proper characterization so we can understand their motivations clearly, and even gets us to care for them a little too.<br/><br/>Creed 2 is a great sequel with heart and strong characterization throughout, and it serves as a beautifully fitting end to Adonis Creed's story, as well as Rocky's."

","What a great feeling was to see all those past legends back after 33 long years.
Ivan drago with his son seeking for revenge. even Stallone's wife in real life back then Brigitte Nielsen was back. my god what a de-zavu was this.
And the surprises don't end here. remember rocky's son from the 6th film in the series Rocky balboa aka Rocky VI ?
yes that dude who played the grown up son in 2006 is back too and this time with a surprise for rocky.
Dudes I will not spoil it for you but if u love rocky films then this is THE FILM to watch as it brings a huge nostalgia to the fans who grew up with those films 30 long years ago and beyond.
the last fight was all the money. a great recapture of the last fight from the rocky IV film but the best thing was kept for last.<br/><br/>the last like 10 minutes of the film are the best minutes I ever saw in a rocky film and that's all i'm gonna have to say about that.<br/><br/>Now......it's time to reveal the only reason I rated this film 9 stars and not 10 stars.
This film has the worst soundtrack of all rocky films before that.
the music was uninspiring and boredom if u exclude a few classic rocky instrumentals we got but only at the end of the film in the last fight.<br/><br/>this soundtrack shows why the 80s were the perfect decade for music.
never the less they should have used even repeat damn it the songs we loved from like 33 years ago.<br/><br/>bring on...eye of the tiger.....burning heart...no easy way out.....that's what we wanted to hear again 33 years after the events of rovky IV in CREED II.<br/><br/>if u can't deliver the proper songs then bring back the old.<br/><br/>Anyways that serious flaw will not destroy a perfect movie from any other aspect cause let's not forget guys that the rocky series were also much about music. the music which defined the series.<br/><br/>so that's why the 9 stars but the film gets AN A grade. ok...A - but an A never the less.<br/><br/>Can't wait for Rocky 9 aka creed 3 (as I hope stallone will change his mind and will appear in the next film also.)"

I was hoping the same for creed and I was UP MOST HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS. With this new generation usually the remakes are garbage to me because the originals are normally gone or the story line just doesn't flow correctly with the story. NOT THIS MOVIE. Not only did it have the perfect story line but it also refreshes your head to the rocky movie in case you happened to forget some parts. It was full of family , pain & dedication. This movie shows the trial and errors between creed and rocky's Life. I think what I love most about it is the fact rocky brought back that authentic ""rocky"" while B. Jordan gave us that new feel YET equal to the struggle that rocky went through. I could care less for boxing but the fighting scenes where EVERYTHING !!! I highly recommend!!!"

","I consider myself a Rocky/Creed fan having seen every film in the franchise upon its initial release. This one ranks DOWN with (and including in the film/plot) the worst aspects of II, IV, V.<br/><br/>The script is tired and retreads plot elements and dialogue from previous movies and except for one surprise was utterly predictable otherwise.<br/><br/>I'm still confused how Rocky's son, Robert, whom the champ is relationally disconnected with, is clearly in the opening as one of Creed's side crew members? Did they add the plot line later and want us to pretend we don't see him in one of the first shots of the film?<br/><br/>In short this was a long drawn out soap opera with predictable and unbelievable fight aspects thrown in to boot.

","The trailer for ""Creed II"" boasts about a showdown between Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and the son of Ivan Drago as an event that will ""rewrite history."" A more accurate description of ""Creed II"" is that it recycles history. In fact, it is a history that for the most part excludes Adonis Creed.<br/><br/>Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) and Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) have a history. Remember Rocky IV? If you do, then you also remember that Ivan Drago and Ludmilla Drago (Brigitte Nielsen) have a history. Ivan Drago and Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu) have a history, and we learn that Ludmilla left both Ivan and Viktor after Ivan was disgraced in the aftermath of his defeat. Adonis Creed's involvement in all of this history is trivial in comparison to Viktor Drago's involvement, as Viktor was around to witness the humiliation of his father's shame. Adonis Creed has no recollection of these events, except for a cursory glance at the death of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) on his tablet.<br/><br/>""Creed II"" is somber, both sonically and visually. It is also anticlimactic, as quizzically, Adonis wins the heavyweight championship belt in an uneventful bout against Danny ""Stuntman"" Wheeler (Andre Ward) very early in the movie. So much for a rousing pandemonium packed payoff. In the end the fight between Adonis and Viktor feels more like the ""gotcha"" of a gimmick intended to spur ticket sales.<br/><br/>And oh yeah, I suppose it's time to start referring to Adonis Creed and Bianca Taylor (Tessa Thompson) by a celebrity couple name. Bianca lovingly refers to Adonis as ""D."" ""Dianca"" has a certain ring to it."
"Ch-Debus","2","7","13","15 February 2019"," Creed 2: Cruise Control
","Rocky IV was the first title of the Rocky franchise I saw in the early 90s and few movies ever had such an inspiring and lasting impact. I had never seen any Rocky or Creed movie hat followed Rocky IV until now.<br/><br/>Only a few minutes into Creed II, the question came up, is there no easy way out? - Admittedly, the easiest way out would have been to leave the cinema straight away, but as I am reserving this measure of last resort for the worst to come - which could happen anytime soon in today's mainstream cinema - I had to endure 120 minutes of utterly bad movie making.<br/><br/>The story is a waste, completely predictable and at no moment one would feel any sympathy or whatsoever with any of the characters. It even does not occur to me why the main character (Adonis) should be considered the good, sympathetic guy while the other one (Viktor) is the villain. Actually one does not care. The best contribution from the movie came actually from Dolph Lundgren, at this was rather as it was nice to see him again, after Aquaman, and not because his acting was outstanding.<br/><br/>The music and the use of music in the movie is also simply bad. Maybe unfair, but comparing to Rocky IV again, these two movies are miles apart. Here an inspiring soundtrack, there some undefinable rap songs.<br/><br/>One moment in the movie, which clearly demonstrated that this is bad movie making was at the end of the second fight. There it is simply said, the Russian audience is supporting Creed, in Rocky IV you could really feel how over time the mood of the audience was shifting to support Rocky. But again in this Creed movie you do not feel any sympathy for any character whatsoever.<br/><br/>I also never realized why Rocky is at the end visiting his son and grandson, but so be it. Similarly the ending scene at the grave of Apollo does not convey a lot of emotions but rather leaves you cold.<br/><br/>Overall, a big disappointment. In all fairness, hard for me to explain why such a B-movie gets such a positive rating on imdb.com. For me a 2 / 10 at best."

","Writing unoriginal and predictable sequels has been done before, by Sylvester Stallone, in the Rocky Series. I actually liked the Rocky movies upto 4, with all the ones after being pretty hopeless. The character of Adonis Creed is totally unlikeable, unrelatable and has the emotional intelligence of a 2 year old toddler. The film is a complete rehash of virtually every Rocky movie and it has no value added for anyone who has seen any of the previous films. It's so bad, I'm writing this review as the film is playing out the last 30 minutes, I don't care what happens to any of the characters. You feel no emotional attachment at any level, with any of the main protagonists. How anyone can score this film 10/10 and say it packs a punch, delivers a knockout or other boxing pub, is beyond me. I am usually patient with find and I can usually pick our something worthwhile. Even the boxing scenes, a high quality feature of the Rocky movies, is sadly lacking in this movie. Terrible choreography and fight scenes, just put the cherry on top or what is arguably one of the worst boxing movies to hit the screens in a long time. Please please please Slyvester, stop making these terrible movies!!"
"methodman-14473","10","7","14","21 November 2018"," Amazing, bittersweet performance by Stallone. One for the ages.
","Raw portrayal of young Adonnis as he struggles to understand his identity and answer the question if he is really worthy of the Creed legacy. The film takes you through his journey as he feels thoroughly humiliated and abandoned to the point where he doubts himself as a man and, in order to help him, Rocky is forced to relive painful moments of his life as the events unfold in an eerily similar manner to his own past with Apollo. A passing of the torch also slowly comes into focus as Rocky grows old and weak and knows he won't always be in the picture. Bring a hanky."

Drago is the superior fighter both in merit and also from the morale underdog role (impoverished, mom abandoned him, his dad was disgraced, etc).

There's something about boxing/combat movies that are so compelling and this was no exception. Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan, and Tessa Thompson (even though she was a bit underwritten) were all as good as they were in original if not better. They even managed to make Creed's adversary sympathetic, and while you weren't rooting for him, you definitely felt and understood his motivation. The fight scenes were choreographed amazingly and definitely packed a physical and emotional punch (lol) I thought the music was a good choice and while the score wasn't always the strongest there were still solid moments. I nearly cried when the Rocky theme came on it was beautiful. I don't think there was a dry eye in the entire theater you could feel the energy building with each punch.

","Viktor Drago is a nice person. He grew up without his mother ,without money but he is disciplined and he is not cocky at all. BUT the problem is that he should be the star of the movie because in addition to his good qualities , he is also a much better boxer than Creed. In the first fight,he destroys him, Creed is down and out of the blue, Victor lands an unnecessary punch which gets him disqualified. Why would they rip off this victory from him? I mean he could at least become a champion because he deserves it and then they could ask for a rematch. But he was deprived of the chance of becoming a champion and this is a mistake.
Ivan and Viktor Drago deserve to make a comeback. Drago did not kill Creed on purpose in Rocky 4. It was Creed's choice to continue the fight even if he was badly hurt and Rocky's choice not to stop the fight even if he could,because Creed did not want to give up. What kind of logic is this? In Rocky 4 I rooted for Drago because Creed chose to die than accepting the fact that he was outmatched by his opponent. Sometimes you have to know when to give up. Drago was a very solid character in the two movies he appeared and at that time it was Cold War time so in USA they had all these movies with the bad Russians (and they still make these movies, unbelievably in every action movie there is a bad Russian). I feel that the movie was biased against the 'bad Russians"" who actually were the only ones who deserved the title"

","Creed was not only the best Rocky Legacy film, but possible the best sports film of all time. Hell, I can tell you now that Creed is in my top films ever made, period!<br/><br/>Nothing about this sequel does this franchise justice. Creed had drama, conflict, humor and action, and from the opening sequence, it continued to build until that climatic end. The sequel makes you fight to stay awake, and cross your fingers that there will be a payoff. Once the closing credits rolled, that track was best part of a terrible film.<br/><br/>This film was cursed from the jump and despite efforts, everyone involved dropped the ball. Stallone write a script and was set to direct. Wiseley, they took the reins from Sly, but I have to say Stephen Caple was the wrong guy for this job. There was no excitement, no comedy and no true gripping conflict. Everything about this film was forced and rushed. The story itself had great promise, but they just couldn't tell the story in a way that stirred up emotion. I have seen a couple honest reviews of this title where the reviewers advise how bad this movie is, but claim true Rocky fans will appreciate the message and story. Sorry, I don't have that appreciation. I don't think they could resurrect the story because they threw too many twist into this in order to stir drama, but since it was poorly planned and executed, you are left feeling like the director didn't know the stakes of what he was taking on.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know what happened to Coogler. His name was never mentioned early on, then he advised that he was working on Black Panther, but the productions timeline for Black panther and production schedule for Creed II didn't overlap. I don't know if Creed was a one off story for Coogler or if he had a fall out with the studio, but they murdered the franchise by not allowing Coogler to continue his vision.<br/><br/>There is nothing like great promise going to waste and this title fell far short of the goal. My nephew thought the movie was epic, but he also thought Venom was the best action film of the summer.<br/><br/>I gave this two stars. It would have been a single star, but I will carry one star over from the original film to give this a second star.

","When you look at the comments section of YouTube. In the video of Apollo Creed vs Drago on the Fandango MovieClips channel. You will notice a lot of fans wishing that Adonis Creed would fight Ivan Drago's son. The creators of Creed (2015) must've known how to do proper fan service. Because here we are, the movie that fans wanted for years!!<br/><br/>When I heard about it, I was shocked. It was a good shock, I was thinking. ""Ivan Drago, that evil boxer from Rocky IV had a son? I have to see this!"" It was also beneficial for the character of Adonis. The darkest part of his past had caught up to him, and he has to face it head on.<br/><br/>Like Rocky IV, I love how much the movie puts an impact on how dangerous the Drago's are. For example: When Ivan and his son Viktor arrive in Philadelphia and are standing on the steps overlooking the city. You can't help but feel that there's a dark cloud looming over the city, because the man who killed Apollo Creed has returned.<br/><br/>It's tough on Rocky too. Because this man, Ivan Drago, is the one boxer he's tried his hardest to forget and now he's back. He tries to prevent Adonis from fighting Viktor, but it doesn't work. I like how both Rocky and Adonis have their own good reasons. Rocky is still beat up over Apollo's death and doesn't want the same thing to happen to Adonis, while Adonis wants to avenge his father and change history.<br/><br/>The emotion and Nostalgia are real in this film. It may not have an amazing soundtrack like Rocky IV, but it makes up for it in story. Rocky knew if Adonis would have a chance at beating Drago, he would have to train like Rocky did. So Rocky takes him to the Desert. Similar to how Rocky trained in Ice-Cold Russia. And let's just say Adonis' 'Hearts are on fire now' XD.<br/><br/>On the final battle, you help but cheer for the hero. (I wish I saw this film in IMAX.) I found it interesting how Ivan threw the towel in. It's a subtle reference to what Rocky should have done in the fight years ago. I love in the end how both Adonis and Rocky get over their personal fears and revisit the people they love.<br/><br/>This movie is a definite win and worthy of being in the Rocky saga. There's just one more thing I have to say. BRING ON CREED III! I want Clubber Lang Jr!"

Its always the big bad zombies - russions (slavic in general), who showen up this ways look like everything but human beings..and thank God there is the good american boy to rise&shine, come and save the day (the end of the movie in this case). The script is simple (in a bad way) and predictable. The whole movie is, as I said in my title - typical American."

Creed I was great, story is already seen but we all liked the idea of something new that has such a big foundation in previous movies. When I saw first trailer for this one I kinda expected something like this, but this movie, as it is, has maybe 30 minutes of relevant story and that's it. For me, it's a big disapointment, cause you watch the movie that is so predictable, and has no emotion at all. I am also a huge fan of boxing and I like movies about boxing, but this one is just so weak. I tried to like it, but it's quite boring and predictable. Another one with big bad Russians."

","If you'd like to watch the 2nd rendition of Rocky IV, by all means see Creed 2. I came into the film with high expectations after the first Creed, but it was obvious that the director decided to go with the same formula that made Rocky 4 so successful. The elements are all there but the story line feels like it's been done before.<br/><br/>On a positive note, there are plenty of heartfelt moments between Rocky and Creed, the acting is good, and the visuals/boxing scenes surely beat out the Rocky predecessors...however there's a familiarity that we've been here before and that it's been done better. Maybe there's no way to replicate the tension of the USSR vs USA of the original, but they tried (admirably) and failed.<br/><br/>""Throw in the towel"" on Creed II and just go binge the original Rocky movies instead."

The beginning and end of the movie hold the only action, albeit action that is, again, poorly executed.

"PizzaBizza","4","4","8","11 February 2019"," Not feeling it
","I watched this yesterday and I seriously don't get the hype. The movie is so full of flaws the I don't know where to begin. From all decisions the movie makes, the director mostly chose the worst from all the options.<br/><br/>Why the heavy focus on the family issue? Who cares? Why drag it out for so long all the time? Why the unrealistic portrait of the life of a World Champion? Does he have no trainer staff, no crew, no fans? Creeds life seems so empty. They live in some place without wallpapers, don't seem to have any belongings and all the characters lack depth. I seriously could not describe them beside their appearance. They are just boring people without interests, without friends, without any life.<br/><br/>Why are obvious questions the movie comes up with not even mentioned, like why a more or less unknown boxer from Russia can just challenge the World Champion? Who sanctioned this? Why is Creed carrying his baby daughter to the gym in the middle of the night? Why doesn't momy care?<br/><br/>Then there is this ridiculous training camp in the desert? Who are these people? Just a bunch of hologram boxers beating each other up in the desert? No accomodations, nothing? Why make the training sequence so dumb? If you want to ""remaster"" the Rocky IV story, why not make an awesome training scene somewhere in Russia again? While there was this topic of high-tech training -vs- lumberjack training in Rocky IV, nothing of the spirit was left in Creed II. Sure, he hits some old tires and gets beaten up by a guy with lots of tats, but all in all the training sequence is boring and hardly convincing. Jordon does not even try to act it out. Yeah, he has muscles, but that's about all there is about this guy, no physical or mental development, nothing. He doesn't even seem to have a particular style. He is just ""a boxer"". He doesn't look or act like a champion, rather like an amateur boxer who is not sure weather to step up to a pro league or not. He is how some teenagers might dream of a perfect muscled-up version of themselves, but Jordan certainly has no fighter personality and I don't buy it.<br/><br/>The fights itself are boring too and lack any clear line. Even the rematch against Drago has nothing new to offer. Stallone tries to be the Mr Miyagi / Yoda of boxing here, but he just is not. He is just an old man waiting to tell his story. Yeah, he asks ""deep"" questions, like ""What are you fighting for?"", but seriously, who cares? Just get to the point. ""Just get to the point"" should have been the working title for this movie."
"saint_brett","5","4","8","30 November 2018"," Mediocre
","The 5 stars I've credited this movie all go to Dolph Lundgren. He's the only reason I went and saw this. And unfortunately he's not given enough screen time. (His role is sinister & vindictive in a Bold and the Beautiful Bill Spencer kind of way, but, without saying much.)
They've cleverly tried to intertwine parts 2 & 4 into this 2018 offering. (When they announced that the final fight was going to be in Russia I honestly thought, ""Hello, Rocky IV, here we go out in the snow again."" But instead they train out in the barren Nevada desert. Guess that had some link to Tommy Gunn wanting water but one must feel the fire burning inside of you instead and you're to utilize it to your advantage? I dunno - At least it was better than that woeful bike scene in Creed 1.)
Sadly there's the lack of a score throughout the movie at times where I found myself thinking on more than one occasion, ""Man, this is boring."" No trumpet solos like Adrian's Theme in part 3 - none of that! Not only that but I find the lead actor Michael B. Jordan one dimensional. He has none of the charisma that Apollo Creed displayed. The same could be said for all movies today - they lack atmosphere and no longer have any feeling.
The baton is definitely handed over to Adonis Creed after the end fight with Rocky's blessing in a touching moment.
And what's lacking in ALL these modern new Rocky movies are the forgotten characters - Paulie, Adrian, Tony and Mick. I mean - what's a Rocky movie without Paulie? Come on! It shows that Rocky's character alone can't hold his own and that the strength of parts 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 came from other players. Even Bill Conti's score is sadly missed.
Want silly? Try this on for size! How's this for silly? Adonis' girlfriend finds out that she's pregnant and gives birth only 3 days later! Things move fast in movie world. Or how 'bout Adonis himself? He suffers 2 broken ribs and a ruptured kidney yet recovers in 3 days' time as well and starts training again. (Movie magic, man! I bet if you were given a life sentence in a Hollywood movie you'd be out in 5 minutes?)
And what happened to all the other contenders from Creed 1? Did they just suddenly retire or aren't in contention anymore for the sequel? I mean - wasn't there one undefeated guy from Creed 1 who was #1 ranked but broke his hand in a scuffle with the British guy? Hmm.
As for Brigitte Nielsen - why was she even in it for? (She won't be winning an Oscar for that performance let me tell you.)
Should have killed Rocky off in Creed 1 with that touching bed scene illness subplot - who knows he may have went close to winning an Oscar for it had they done so? Today's movies can't ensnare the late 70's or 1980's anymore so I say leave alone what came before and try to create something new for today's generation. (You can't keep relying on the past for your spring board today. Give today's generation something they can be proud of and call their own. Sadly the trend will continue.) No more please. P.S. Whatever happened to Cuff & Link in the modern Rocky movies? Or the groovy robot of Paulie's from part 4?"
"zkonedog","8","5","11","22 November 2018"," Not Quite Its Predecessor, But Close Enough To Still Be Great
","The first Creed film, released in 2015, was masterful in crafting a new boxing tale for a new generation, all the while respecting the legacy that Sylvester Stallone had created for that universe. While Creed II may not quite nail that nearly perfect balance all the time, it does a remarkable job as sequels go.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, Creed II sees Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) now an established pugilist fighting for championships with Rocky Balboa (Stallone) still in his corner. At the same time, Adonis is taking the first steps toward family life with Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Out of nowhere (well, the deep recesses of the old Soviet Union, to be more specific), old Balboa nemesis Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) and monstrous son Viktor (Florian Munteanu), also a fighter, show up to challenge Donnie to a match. With the legacy of his father and name on the line, Donnie ultimately accepts the challenge...but this time ""Unc"" (Rocky) will not support him.<br/><br/>To me, the first Creed was an Oscar-worthy (if not winning, sadly) type of film. Creed II isn't quite that ""tight"", but it still makes enough interesting choices and creates genuine emotion to be a great film.<br/><br/>Thematically, the movie is kind of a mashup of themes from Rocky II, III, & IV, what with Adonis coming to terms with family life, struggling to recapture that ""eye of the tiger"", if you will, and finally confronting the paternal demons that continue to haunt him. For the most part, director Steven Caple Jr. deftly balances all those themes. Then, of course, there is the presence of Stallone's Rocky himself, which is always in danger of being a distraction to the overall proceedings but never comes close to that, due to solid writing and Stallone's just general understanding of the character. ""Legacy characters"" can often bog down films they appear in, but the exact opposite happens here: when Rocky is on-screen, his mannerisms and dialogue are an absolute delight.<br/><br/>One filmmaking choice I really enjoyed was the focus on the Drago family. Starting the entire picture off with them really set a tone that was doggedly pursued throughout. To be completely honest, I actually think that this angle could have been played up even more over the course of the movie, as it was fascinating to me how Viktor's journey compared to that of Adonis's. I realize why it didn't comprise a larger portion of the action (most people watching this film likely do not know all the implications of the Drago name in this franchise), but for the die-hards it easily could have. As it stands, that family plot still works just well enough to pay off in the end.<br/><br/>Overall, I came into Creed II with admittedly impossibly high expectations considering my reverence for the original. While I can't say that it checked every box quite as perfectly as that Ryan Coogler-directed previous installment did, it comes close enough to still maintain that sense of gravitas and emotion all the way through. Whether you've been a fan of Rocky since 1976 or are coming to the entire franchise through the Creed side of things, you'll be entertained and moved by the experience here."

"malcolmwrites","4","2","3","12 October 2019"," An unfortunate effort
","Creed II - REVIEW<br/><br/>First of all, and I say this as a HUGE fan of Michael B. Jordan, of Sly, and of the whole Rocky franchise, this is a derivative, motionless movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>In Creed II, the hero loses the first fight because he's compelled to by the script. He wins the rematch, again, because the script says, ""Hero must win the rematch.""<br/><br/>It's all paint by numbers. And the writers and director take great pains to stay well within the lines.<br/><br/>Compare this to Rocky III and IV, which contain all the vastly superior and far more original and organic narrative elements upon which Creed II tries ostensibly to draw.<br/><br/>In Rocky III, Rocky, successful, overconfident and then distracted and distraught over Mickey's failing health, loses to Clubber Lang. He regroups by ""going back to the basics"" under the tutelage of his rival-turned-friend Apollo Creed. His comeback is spurred on by a confession of fear in an emotional shoreside argument with Adrian, who reminds him what it really means to be a fighter.<br/><br/>In Rocky IV, Rocky wins his fight against Ivan Drago by ""going back to the basics"" and working out in the Russian tundra while Drago gets juiced up in his high-tech training facility. It's a Predator-esque triumph of the natural American spirit over a world/universe of burgeoning technology.<br/><br/>We get absolutely none of this thematic subtext in Creed II. Even the astronomically unlikely fact of a newborn baby (of a hearing-abled father and a mother with what appears to have been adult onset hearing loss) being diagnosed as completely deaf upon birth seems contrived and pigeonholed in. And it doesn't come close to even finding the slimmest thread of a heartstring to tug upon.<br/><br/>(I'm not going to even get into the head-scratching choice to turn Drago back into a vengeful, scowling villain after we saw him stand up to his entire manipulative, totalitarian government in the spirit of one-on-one combat with the ""piece of iron"" adversary he came to fear and respect in their epic battle ""to the end."")<br/><br/>So...I wound up giving Creed II what I feel is an accurate if slightly generous four stars out of ten. Mostly because-for all it tries to do and for all it wants to be-I wound up just feeling kind of sorry for it."

","Directed by Steven Caple Jr. Starring Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Wood Harris, Dolph Lundgren, Phylicia Rashad, Florian ""Big Nasty"" Munteanu, Russell Hornsby. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Despite a satisfying wrap-up with closure at the end of ""Creed,"" the temptation to return to the well for another go-around was too strong to ignore; fortunately, while the script reverts to formula and offers few surprises, it still works, thanks in large part to its commitment to character and heart. The premise is the sort of thing that could only exist in Hollywood: after Adonis Creed (Jordan), son of the deceased Apollo Creed, wins the heavyweight championship belt, a challenger arrives in the form of Viktor Drago (Munteanu), son of Ivan Drago (Lundgren), former opponent of Creed's trainer Rocky Balboa (Stallone) and, oh, yeah, the man who killed Creed's pop. Though the boxing scenes are competently-staged and rousing enough, it's the performances, relationships, baggage and emotion that make this a cut above the routine cash-grab sequel level--not just the well-worn ones from the prior film, but also the morose fate of elder Drago and his family after losing his mid-80s bout. Brigitte Nielsen reprises her role from ""Rocky IV"" as well, though it would best be classified as a cameo.<br/><br/>71/100"
"bartramsimon","9","1","1","21 December 2019"," Serious Drama!
","Love the Rocky series warts and all. It's incredible to see the tone and style of these movies shift with the times.
Creed II and Rocky IV couldn't be any more different. Kudos to Stallone and the production team for recognising how to freshen up the franchise and craft a believable story with real character development.
Really the series should've finished with Rocky Balboa it was an appropriate send off but injecting life into Rocky as a mentor to Adonis Creed has taken the movies into a different style and tonal shift.<br/><br/>Colliding this fresh take with the highly bombastic and flashiest Rocky sequel with the return of Ivan Drago isn't easy but I'm flabbergasted at the quality of this piece of cinema.
All the elements are there montages of training and every punch exaggerated but it feels grounded and earthy much like the first two Rocky films were.
Great script and acting performances from all the leads. Dolph Lundgren in particular is a real surprise he has that coldness still but it's laced with an undercurrent of a man who's broken really and wants his life back.
Every expression is very nuanced and the relationship between him and Victor really powers the film for Adonis to face up to the uncertainty in his life.<br/><br/>Also these films have always had great musical scores. An important part of these movies as it's based around sport and music takes on a bigger role.<br/><br/>Loved it my favourite film of all the movies now as it used to be Rocky 3 but this although borrowed heavily from that and 4 enhanced the film to a higher level than it's predecessors.
One thing I didn't expect in conclusion was to to actually cry in the final scenes a statement of how invested I was in the characters by the end."
"twanster-1","8","1","1","15 December 2019"," Great continuation but...
","Overall the movie is a great continuation of the rocky franchise. Keeping rocky alive as a trainer is a brilliant but if they make another episode, they need to progress rocky more. Former world champ, made a sold out comeback fight then went on to train 2 World champions and yet he's still living like a bum.. Makes no sense.. Even as a small business owner he'd be doing better than he's portrayed. If Creed 3 happens I hope they've addressed this or at least explained what he's doing with the fortune he's made..
The whole plot is great tbh, the movie moves the characters along and the appearance of drago is epic. Would have loved more interaction between rocky and drago.
My biggest problem with the movie is the music tho.. Its dreadful.. The training scenes, the fight entrances etc, very poor choice for a soundtrack. It doesn't uplift or even make you will the characters on. Whoever chose the music really let the movie down and because of that it did kill the mood of some great scenes.. Like in the desert training. Awful. I love hiphop but this is like mumble rap rubbish..
Lastely, and this really was a poor choice for this film. Was having creeds fiance sing his entrance.. That was really cringy and really goes back to my point about the music being dreadful.
Other than that tho I've seen the film a few times and it's still enjoyable. I'd like to see more rocky in a 3rd outing, I'm sure I'm not the only one who watches these to see what Ricky's up to."

","Creed II stars Michael B Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, and Dolph Lundgren. After the events of Creed II, Adonis Creed faces off against Ivan Drago the son of Viktor Drago. Ivan challenges him to a fight and Adonis accepts so he can honor his father's legacy. I have never seen Rocky IV, but I do know that Dolph Lundgren and Sylvester Stallone were in it and I like how they decided to reunite these to characters on the big screen. When I watch this I kept asking myself do I need to watch Rocky IV to understand what's happening? And the answer is no I don't because I don't need to know about the events of Rocky IV so I can get a better understanding of when I'm watching Creed II and its not confusing either. The cast is brilliant as they all have excellent chemistry and character development especially by Michael B Jordan as he takes us on his journey from being cocky in Creed. And then in Creed II we see him go from cocky and ignorant, to being broken, and then finally he rises from the ashes. The pacing bothered me at first because when we got to the fight between Adonis and Ivan I thought that the movie was over, but then I looked at my watch and realized that there was another hour left of the film. It annoyed me, but I feel that's what the writers and the directors were given us is because they wanted to show Adonis' life crumble and rise again, but its directed and edited that I forgot about the pacing. I have to give credit to the soundtrack because after hearing that it makes me want to download the soundtrack so I can go the gym. Overall, this is worth seeing it in the theatres, especially if you're a Rocky fan so you can get a wave of nostalgia as you watch Sylvester and Dolph reunite."

But without Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) in his corner, Donnie barely scrapes by with his title - and life - intact. But with his wife (Tessa Thompson) and newborn battling their own medical issues, Donnie doesn't have time to wallow before the rematch.<br/><br/>While the original cast excels in their roles again, the nostalgic narrative of this overly inspirational sequel relies too heavily on Rocky clichés.

"s-maniatopoulos","Null","1","1","22 February 2019"," Good but not like the first one
","The only thing missing from this film is the unique eye of Ryan Coogler, a wonderful director who turned the first movie into a personal experience. This was a wonderful achievement and made Creed one of the best boxing movies of all time: The camera work was impeccable, and most of the time the viewer stepped into the ring with Adonis Creed, felt every punch and rejoiced with every victory.<br/><br/>The second movie brings back an old feud, the legendary Creed vs Drago storyline, which is an exceptional opportunity to build on Rocky's legacy.<br/><br/>But this time around, nothing feels real nor personal. The movie is shot pretty blandly, and it feels like one more boxing movie. What saves it from mediocrity is a very tight script and convincing performances by all cast. Stallone and Lundgren both excel in their parts, and this adds gravitas to the movie, which on numerous occasions flirts with b-movie moments.
However, the cathartic ending, coupled with a predictable yet unrushed narrative make Creed II an overall enjoyable experience, so this is a recommended film.<br/><br/>In the end though, we will never find out what might have been, had Ryan Coogler directed it. The new director cannot repeat the Coogle's achievement, and delivers an average cinematic experience."

Total rubbish and completely USA Propaganda.<br/><br/>2. This movie is almost a bad re-mark of the amazing Rocky IV (1985). In the 1985 movie we see both fighters train really hard and there is a sense of Realism. In this movie we see some training in the desert and is average! Sylvester Stallone really does some hardcore training where as Michael B. Jordan does some basic almost laughable.<br/><br/>3. Nothing New, the story line is nothing new and Sylvester Stallone has said he won't be in another Rocky movie!

Rocky IV (1985) made Box office: $300.4 million
Creed II (2018) made Box office $212.1 million<br/><br/>An 80's movie made more money than a 2018 movie!<br/><br/>5. Drago wins the fight on points and his father stabs him in the back and throws in the towel just before he because the World champion - I DON'T THINK SO!"

I know sly considers himself deep and all that but rocky saying serious philosophical stuff just gets a bit boring.

"a_chinn","6","0","0","26 April 2020"," More of a ""Rocky IV"" sequel and a ""Creed"" sequel
","Solid sequel is entertaining, but felt less like a sequel to ""Creed"" and more like a sequel to ""Rocky IV,"" with Rocky continuing to mentor young Adonis Creed, an excellent Michael B. Jordan, only this time Adonis has to fight the son Rocky's dirty commie nemesis, Ivan Drago, who killed Adonis' father at a Vegas James Brown concert (okay, I'm going glib). With the writer/director of the first Creed film, Ryan Coogler, moving on to bigger and better things, writing and directing duties were turned over to others and this sequel loses some of the human element that elevated ""Creed"" above other Rocky sequels. ""Creed II"" is takes more time to develop characters than most Rocky sequels and avoids the jingoism and silliness of ""Rocky IV"" (there's no equivalent of Paulie and Rocky's robot maid or Rocky's Regan-era anti-commie speech at the end). The subtext of fathers and sons looms large over ""Creed II"" as Rocky and Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago both seek redemption through their sons (a surrogate son in the case of Rocky) that builds to a climactic battle in the ring. But to put the film in perspective, it's really only a few scenes, such as one between Rocky and Drago at his rrestaurant, that have the kind of poignancy that made the first Creed film such a standout. Michael B. Jordan continues to shine as the film's lead, but for me, this film felt like it was more about Rocky and Drago having one last battle. I was also tickled to see Brigitte Nielsen (Stallone's real-life ex-wife) reprise her role from ""Rocky IV"" as Drago's wife (now ex-wife) in a brief cameo that greatly helped to define the current state of Drago's character today. Overall, ""Creed II"" is nowhere as good as the original film, but does offer more humanity than most Rocky sequels and remains an entertaining fight film that's well worth checking out. FUN FACT: Stallone is now two years older than Burgess Meredith when he trained Rocky in the original 1976 film."

","The follow-up chapter to Creed does lack the freshness of the original but Creed II still manages to deliver an adrenaline-fuelled ride that's fun, rousing & rewarding for the most part, and features a story that's 33 years in the making as it pits two second generation boxers against one another in a match that's equally personal to both fighters.<br/><br/>Strongly echoing Rocky IV, the story is set three years after the events of the last film and follows Adonis Creed who has now made his way to the top of the sport, and is the new world champion. But his celebration is cut short when he is issued a challenge by Viktor Drago, the son of former Soviet boxer Ivan Drago who killed Apollo Creed inside the ring over three decades ago.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Caple Jr, his treatment of the scripted material is very much by the books, for the story lacks any element of surprise and is predictable. The film addresses themes of family, legacy, loss, revenge, resurrection & redemption but the dramatic portions don't necessarily pack the same emotional punch that Ryan Coogler's film was able to land for the entirety of its runtime.<br/><br/>The return of Ivan Drago is a welcome choice though, and his presence still retains a formidable aura. There isn't a lot for Rocky Balboa to do here yet the film comes alive whenever he is on screen. The boxing matches are brilliantly choreographed, training montages are expertly edited, and the music accompanying these scenes brim with a pulsating energy that only adds more fuel to the mix.<br/><br/>Leading from the front in acting department is Michael B. Jordan who articulates Adonis Creed's journey through hellfire & brimstone with finesse, and he is terrific throughout. Sylvester Stallone dons his signature role for one last round and does well with what he's given. Dolph Lundgren returns as Ivan Drago and steals nearly every scene he's in. But it is the mentor-disciple dynamic between Balboa & Creed that gives this film its finest moments.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Creed II is neither wholly impressive in filmmaking terms nor resonant enough on emotional scale when compared to its ingeniously crafted predecessor but it does what it set out to do and despite the slump in storytelling quality, the film delivers a blood-pumping, pulse-pounding & adrenaline-rushing extravaganza that's entertaining & fulfilling enough to rank amongst the better entries in the once concluded but recently revived saga. Definitely recommended."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>In what is basically a re-make of Rocky IV - the predictability of Creed II does not hurt this latest installment into the Rocky franchise. Michael B. Jordan reprises his role as Adonis Creed with the ever reliable and faithful, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) by his side.<br/><br/>When Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) and his son, Viktor (Florian Munteanu), show up in the United States right after Adonis has been crowned the Heavy Weight Champion of the World, it doesn't take long to see why. Viktor has been training under his father's tutelage and is hungry for the belt that Adonis now possesses. Old wounds are opened when images of his father's death flash across tv screens, and Adonis takes the challenge and loses badly. Now with a daughter and fiance to think about, Adonis finds himself digging deeper inside of himself than he's ever had to before to face Viktor once more - in Moscow, Russia. But this time, Rocky is in his corner.<br/><br/>I was thinking to myself - this is just basically Rocky for a new generation. In the first Rocky movie, Balboa loses by split decision. Same thing happens to Adonis Creed in the first Creed film. We already knew coming in that Adonis was going to win this one. So, a repeat of events - the only difference is, they combined the 2nd Rocky with the 4th and delivered Creed II. And yet, I still really liked it. There is a lot of style, eye candy, a strong soundtrack and even stronger characterizations. This is a good movie ... for a new generation. Even for those of us who were around when the original Rocky films were in the theaters.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this one. A worthy entry into a solid film franchise. Something tells me we will undoubtedly see a Creed III down the road. And why not? If it stays as entertaining as the first two, I'd go watch it."

Now fans (me included) wanted something original from this movie, Drago's character development, we didn't get this unexpected thing, first match went as we expected and somehow he will find strength to go against him one more time and beat him. And this is what happened, I wanted to see something more than that...What I really like though was the family moments and especially the final scene when Rocky reconnects with his son see his granddaughter for the first time...that was touching.

","Viktor Drago is training under his father Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) in snowbound Ukraine. Ivan has lived in sad infamy ever since his loss to Rocky. To regain their family honor, they travel to Philadelphia to challenge newly crowned champion Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) who has been carefully managed by Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). Meanwhile, Adonis proposes to Bianca (Tessa Thompson).<br/><br/>This is a rather simple idea. The franchise is revisiting Rocky IV and reconnecting with the old characters. In that way, I almost want to revisit that movie at the start with a few flashbacks. This time around, the most compelling characters may well be the Dragos. The best scene is Ivan surprising Rocky with a visit. I like Michael B. Jordan and I like him in this franchise. There are a couple of flat notes in a couple of scenes. His child's hearing test is one. I can accept his pushing the scene to the limit by crying although it would be more emotional if he stays stoic to please Bianca. He could force a fake smile for her until he can't anymore. The point is to transfer the emotional moment to the audience rather than to do a play by number cry scene. Another problem is the final fight. I can't buy him breaking his rib and almost immediately go Superman on Viktor. The rib punch is too much to come back from and Viktor switches from world beater to chump too quickly. Then there is Viktor himself. The size difference is overwhelming. There may be a way to use that but it would be much better to simply use a smaller fighter for Viktor. It's not like he's asked to do any real acting anyways. He's a machine. They should just find a smaller machine. There is also a need to set up Viktor's performance in the climatic fight much better. His montage shouldn't be his endless training with his father. His montage should be him partying and luxuriating in his victories. He should be caught by the siren calls of a Vegas lifestyle to the frustration of his father. That would explain his eventual collapse in the final fight as he runs out of fuel. Overall, this is really good although I would still make a few changes."

It became all about rematches and revenges, the formulas divided the movies into three clear acts the starting point with ""everything's doing great"" then ""everything's falling apart"" leading to self-questioning and existential crises and finally ""everything's great again"" with the final game, final bell music etc.<br/><br/>Yet the series had found its own antidote against these schematic structures: heart. In ""II"", Rocky proposed to Adrian, she lapsed into coma, they had their son, in ""III, Mickey died and Rocky's friendship with Apollo was sealed, there was always a way to look at another direction, but then something changed, the audiences became vaccinated against these emotional tricks. That could pass with ""Rocky IV"" but ""Rocky V"" was the one disgrace too many.<br/><br/>Now let's be honest, ""Rocky Balboa"" and ""Creed"" aimed higher than their predecessors but they weren't that original. In ""Creed"", it was the legacy of Apollo that made us care for young Adonis, Michael B. Jordan's spectacular performance did the rest and drew us into caring for his mother (Philycia Rashad) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson). But story-wise, neither of ""Rocky Balboa"" or ""Creed"" reinvented the wheel and owed their popularity to the whole series and the fact that time make characters like a good wine.<br/><br/>The reason of this lengthy preamble is that ""Creed II"", as anticipated as it was, didn't exactly start on solid ground. The 'surprise effect' was over, Adonis didn't have any major demons to fight anymore. Only the 'Rocky' situation with his son was left pending but after Stallone's nomination, it was time to remind viewers that it was about Adonis. And when I learned that the film would feature the son of Ivan Drago, the shadow of revenges and rematches began to haunt this movie.<br/><br/>Formulas again. I expected history to repeat itself, the two games, one to lose, one to win. I expect the whole doubting about himself and fighting his demons, I even expected the emotional stuff, positive like the birth of the baby and negative with a little misunderstanding with Rocky. I could see this coming a mile way. Then why did I leave the theater so overwhelmed by emotion? Why did the film hit me so hard that it even lured me into taking some decisions with a few demons of mine? Why did I cry?<br/><br/>Emotions can't lie, I love the 'Rocky' franchise but not to the point of blinding myself when it comes to flaws, this film isn't without a few missed shots but seriously, it's as good as the first ""Creed"", if not better at times. Now, I have a dilemma. Should I go deeper in my analysis at the risk of making this a non spoiler-free review and preach a choir? Or should I just kept this vague enough to encourage the skeptics.<br/><br/>You know what? Let's just spoil the whole thing because fans don't need anyone's blessing (kind of like any climactic fight in the series). I refuse to believe someone would need a review's endorsement so let's just that I loved it because it surprised me. And when the greatest opponent of a series is formula, ""surprise"" can only be a victory. And I don't mean the overused ""going the distance"", I mean the truly unexpected ones with an emotional impact, narratively, these are knock-out victories.<br/><br/>The first surprise is that the film might have the best opponent after Apollo Creed. Clubber Lang was tough and raw but he too one-dimensional even in his colorfulness to be taken seriously, Ivan Drago was a killing machine who only needed a humbling experience, nothing substantial could come from him in a movie whose biggest shock was the loss of Apollo. Tommy Gunn was just a joke, and even in the last two films the opponents were only foils.<br/><br/>But ""Creed II"" had the master trump: Drago's son. It was risky because of the whole ""son against son"" thing (sounds like a damn monster movie, as would Apollo said, 'rest his soul) but it works because as the movie progresses, we start to understand Drago's motives and they're interesting, then we draw parallels with Adonis' own motives and they're fascinating.<br/><br/>Indeed, the film starts as your usual sequel and in a way you didn't see coming, becomes a film that makes you think not about victory, but about failing, about the poisoning effect of loss and abandonment in one's self-confidence, and even Rocky's backstory with his son joins the emotional band wagon and we don't have two but three plots that tie up together in a satisfying way, one that made me think of myself and made me realize that sometimes, the biggest victory is also to reconcile yourself with defeat.<br/><br/>And for that, the film offers not just one but two powerful surprising outcomes, one where Adonis ""wins"" on a technicality while lying on the ring after a real massacre, and another where Viktor Drago loses on a thrown towel, one of the best moments in the franchise, and in itself a victory that redeems the two Russians. Going the distance works in mysterious ways, it's one thing to keep moving forward, but knowing when to throw it can be the sum of all wisdoms.<br/><br/>In a way that's what Rocky did when he went to see his son and grandson at the end, a sweet touch that made me realize it was time for him to leave gracefully and I'm sure that ""Creed"" franchise is 'gonna fly' with its own wings."
"gerrypurcell","7","0","0","18 January 2019"," Very good movie, could have been great
","I watched this movie yesterday and did really enjoy it. There are a few things that hold me back from rating Creed 2 as a great movie though. Firstly, Adonis is no Rocky. It was easy to love Rocky. Apart from him having it tough he's a good guy with a real heart. Humble. Adonis is just harder to love. He's like a big kid who wants to be looked after all the time. Ok, now the storyline. It's great and links back to the previous movies well. However, it could have been an hour longer. It fast forwards a lot. In one scene Drago first lays down the gauntlet to Creed. Before you know it they are in the ring. So much more could have been explored. More depth could have been added to Adonis. He might then be more endearing. There could have been more of a side story between drago senor and Rocky. The film didn't really go there. The fight scenes are good, but even though older and more roughly put together I think the fight scenes in the old Rocky movies have more heart. You're with rocky. But wiith Creed 2 it's style over substance and I didn't find myself really hoping Adonis would win. The whole Drago family back story could have been explored more, but perhaps this was intentionally avoided as Drago junior has the potential to be more likeble than Adonis. He's definately more Rocky than Adonis. All in all still a very good movie and a great addition to the Rock franchise."

"whavasi","9","0","0","16 January 2019"," Creed Two Punches Its' Way To The Top Of The Charts
","I have never felt as motivated to start working out and boxing as I did when I was leaving the movie theater after watching Creed Two. From the classic work out scenes to Adonis getting in the ring with Viktor there is no shortage of motivation. Although the motivation only lasted a couple of days, and shortly after I went back to watching TV, for a second there, I felt like I was in the ring with Adonis Creed. Everyone who watched Creed was scared to see if Creed Two could be just as good, and it was. Creed Two is the 8th movie in the Rocky/Creed Franchise and the second Creed Movie. It is directed by Steven Caple Jr. who also directed The Land in 2016. Creed Two is full of packed punches and upper cuts from Creed and classic characters from Rocky.
Creed Two brings back characters and storylines from Rocky IV. Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) gets back in the ring after his biggest fight of his career in Creed. In Creed Two Adonis fights Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), the son of Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), the man who killed Apollo Creed in the boxing ring in Rocky IV. Ivan and Viktor want to repair their reputation and what better way to do that than by fighting the boxing champ of the world. Adonis struggles to take the fight with the fear that he will share the same fate as his father.
Michael B. Jordan plays the role of Adonis Creed better than anyone else could have. He was perfect in the more intense scenes and you couldn't help but root for him throughout the movie. Michael B. Jordan took the role of Adonis seriously in his real life since the last movie. He is significantly bigger and stronger and makes everyone in the audiences curious if they can do his workout routine that is posted all over the internet. Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky Balboa and nails the role once again. In Creed Two Rocky struggles with not wanting Adonis to take and fight and share the same fate as his father. He brings the audience into the movie and connects with them. You feel his pain and regret for Apollo's death and you don't want that to happen to Adonis.
I got chills as Adonis Creed was walking into the ring for the first fight. Playing Icon by Jaden Smith and the visual effects made you excited like you have never been to see a fight. It's not a Rocky/Creed movie without an insane workout scene and they nailed it again. This time they train in the desert and they play Runnin by Mike WiLL Made-It and it made you want to go straight to the gym. They also played some classic Rocky songs like Gonna Fly Now. Mike WiLL Made-It brought a bunch of popular rap songs into the movie and it fit perfectly with the movie. The soundtrack made the movie more exciting and fun to watch.
The plot of Creed Two was brilliant in incorporating classic characters and storylines and mixing it in with Adonis Creed. Unlike the first Creed, Creed Two made a fight mean more than just winning, but about revenge for the death of Apollo Creed. The movie had two fights between Adonis and Viktor in the boxing ring, and even a fight outside of the ring between Rocky and Ivan. The movie seemed to move very fast through the first training season as soon as the first fight began, being so early in the film, it was clear that Creed would lose and that there would have to be a second. Because of this, I believe that the plot was too predictable although it was entertaining to watch two fights.
Overall if you liked Creed will enjoy Creed Two. Michael B. Jordan's role in Creed Two was more exciting and better than his role in Creed. If you want to get motivated or get very excited throughout a movie then watch Creed Two. It was for sure a top five favorite movies in 2018 and I am very excited to see what they have in store for us for the third instalment of the Creed series."
"jadongarcia","9","0","0","15 January 2019"," *SPOILERS* Way more than a replica of Rocky 4
","This film pays lots of respect to previous rocky films and some might say its an exact copy. But its more than that.<br/><br/>The first the thing the film does that stands out a lot to me is how much Adonis resembles his fathers' persona, for instance, in the final fight between creed and drago, in the last break before the last round, Rocky states ""you like the pain, you know why? Because you're dangerous!"" Just as his father said in the Second installment of the Rocky franchise back in '79 when duke says ""this man is dangerous"" and Apollo replies with ""I'm dangerous!"". Also when Rocky visited his son at the end, was so satisfying, its almost what we as the fans needed, to know that Rocky still has his legacy or his arc even in a film about Adonis Creed. I also felt that this film resembled Rocky III by a long shot given the fact that Rocky did not want Adonis to fight drago for his own good, just as Micky did the same to Rocky in Rocky III, and also the fact that they got their rematch after realizing that they didn't have to fight for anybody but for themselves.<br/><br/>However, out of all the special things in this film, there is ONE in particular that I have yet to mention and that is the arc of the Dragos. Its exactly what made this movie perfect, what made it better than Rocky 4, because at the end you realize Adonis is not the only person fighting for something in this film, its Viktor as well. After the fight, Viktor cries in disappointment because he did not win, and what makes the dragos more empathetic is that Viktor was fighting to gain his own father's respect and/or love. Throughout the film, Viktor has this determination to win because he is also mad at the people that left his father, such as his wife and loss of respect from his own country because Ivan didn't win back in '85. And the single line that choked me up after Ivan consults Viktor is that he said ""It's okay"" which proves that Ivan loved his son the whole time, and also the fact that he was the only person who still cared for him, as Ludmilla left as she saw Creed begin to hold the upper hand in the fight and how the audience switches sides when previously cheering for Drago in the beginning.<br/><br/>This film both paid respect to the Rocky franchise and continued Adonis' legacy."
"Lovechef21","7","0","0","14 January 2019"," Creed 2 (Rocky 8): A Family Movie
","Rocky 4 was easily one of the best (the best?) of the series for it's perfect combo of drama, exciting fight scenes, maybe the best training montage (and workout music), and cold war camp, not to mention one of the best messages for peace at the time (""If I can change, and you can change, we all can cheagghhh!!!!"").<br/><br/>(Rocky 4 spoiler ahead)<br/><br/>Creed 2 which builds off the drama of Rocky 4 by having Apollo Creed's son go up against the son of Ivan Drago, the cold Frankenstein's Monster-like Russian boxer who killed Apollo Creed in that movie. People expecting the same kind of film as Rocky 4 may come out feeling both unsatisfied on that same level, but also satisfied enough with a movie that is more about families than who wins a big boxing match. I found that the relationship between Drago and his son and what happened to Drago after 4 to be the most interesting thing about the movie, while at the same time I find it hard to imagine their brief but economic scenes taking up any more time than what they did."

","I didn't enjoy the first Creed as much as any of ""Rocky"" movies but still it was very heart-warming to see some of the actors from previous installments return to their past characters. I hate to say it but the nostalgia was the only thing keeping me interested throughout the movie: return of Ivan Drago, this time with his son trying to take away Balboa and Creed's fame, was a great move but it didn't bring anything new to the sequel; in fact, if it wasn't named Creed II it could have easily been Rocky VII because it felt too much like the fourth part all the way - the same plotlines, the same character development, even the same locations and movie structure in general. The dialogues are also trying way too hard to be meaningful but in reality are plain dull and pseudophilosophical because we've already had the same problems and the same dilemmas in Rocky IV. And in the end we're left with a couple of well-choreographed fight scenes (as usual) and tons of nostalgia: especially when seeing the characters of Brigitte Nielsen and Milo Ventimiglia, sadly only in cameos. The most touching moment for me was Dragos' send-off, the only characters who really had some growth in development. In short, Creed II works perfectly if you haven't seen Rocky IV; it adds nothing new to the franchise but makes it a very pleasant watch nonetheless."

"pauldesimone01","Null","0","0","8 January 2019"," not a rocky worthy film
","I have to be honest I was excited to see creed 2 in the theatre after seeing creed. That excitement disappeared quickly with in the first 20 min of the film. Literally I was watching bits and pieces of other rocky films pieced together to make this film. To the untrained eye or someone with no knowledge of the previous movies this movie could be seen as good, or even above average. But knowing these films in and out it was a unenjoyable ,poorly thought out film. Let me prove that point to you.
1. The backstory of Ivan dragon and his son is so strong yet it was barely used in the film. It was like having a shiny brand new bike, and getting glimpses of it, but never being able to ride it. (What a huge blunder).
2. Creeds mysteriously fine, and ready to fight similar (identical) in rocky 3. Obviously a rushed not thought out project. You had mr t. In his prime and wasted it in rocky 3. This film had the ultimate bad guy and literally wasted it.
3. It's not believable and I say this because it's a movie based on sports. Creed completely looses credit in the way he fights, mentally and physically. The film doesn't make sense rocky himself in his thinking follows the character well but no one else does. So I get that continuity in the characters mental thinking. But highly flawed because at some point you need to think about what is going to make this film more interesting. That was a huge mistake and let's face it action fans of Sylvester Stallone are not getting younger.
4. The passing of the tourch so to speak in this film was overdone, not needed in a self explanatory film, where the fighter couldn't win with out rocky how will he make it in the next film?probably already being shot. The film made money but it could have been a masterpiece tripling what it grossed. This was a blunder!
5. My final point is at points in this film the plot and storyline swayed to is this a rocky film to is this a creed film. As in (Sylvester Stallone is still clutching to relevance in the film) rocky is a big part of the film but entirely taking away from the plot. When you watch the film you will know wat I mean. Total missed opportunities, I could write a rocky film in a week film it and it would blow this film out of the water with that kind of money they had. And I am a huge fan of Sylvester Stallone so don't get it twisted.
The film has points of brilliance but too many missed opportunities. It was boring at times, and never made you want to cheer for creed to want to fight. That in it self was a blunder. Soft"

"niko-oinonen","5","0","0","6 January 2019"," Two stories that don't fit together
","I have rather mixed feelings of Creed II. It has two incompatible pieces. The first piece is the revenge story of Ivan Drago and his son and how they're trying to regain their lost glory in Russia by beating Apollo Creed's son. The other one is of Creed's son Adonis and his new fiancée and their new born baby. Adonis now has something important in his life, something too important to lose.<br/><br/>After his first match with Drago's son he's lying on a hospital bed bruised, barely able to talk. It's a moment that would make one to think twice before entering the ring again. Even Adonis himself recognizes the possibility that his daughter might have to live without a father, if he would face Drago again.<br/><br/>The film stays on this route for surprisingly long. It's a very humane moment where you might even forget this is a boxing movie. Meanwhile we learn that Drago and his son are seeking a rematch in a hope that it would bring back their mother/wife. Maybe it's the accent or the total cold heartedness of her that to me makes their desperate struggle seem unintentionally comedic.<br/><br/>All this time there's a thought in the back in the head that the final rematch fight is coming, but what's happening on screen doesn't feel like it's leading up to it. Instead, it feels like there shouldn't be any match. But of course, that won't do. And there's the laziest transition back to training and to the ring that brushes aside everything that has happened so far. ""I have to fight him again"", he says. All the worries about the baby and the possibility of Adonis getting hurt or dying in the ring like his father are forgotten by everyone. And the built up to the fight is so victorious in on itself that the possibility of him losing is pretty much out of the picture. If the film had wanted to say something meaningful about family and life outside the ring, wouldn't it have been more impactful to the story, if Rocky had saved Adonis during the rematch by throwing in the towel like he contemplates, if he should had done during his father's fight all those years ago. Maybe it wouldn't have been as triumphant, but it would have fit the two pieces together better rather than forcing them together."

","The champion is back. And not only Rocky Balboa, but Adonis Creed, son of his former colleague and rival Apollo Creed. And this time Creed will have to overcome the obstacles that his rival presents to him to retain his title of world heavyweight champion; for this he will need an arduous training (shown in a musical montage), and overcome the fears and doubts that afflict his emotional state. Also on this occasion he must keep afloat his relationship, as well as a new paternity. All this will lead to a great final fight in which not only the championship but the honor is played.
Does this plot sound familiar? Yes, Creed II does not offer anything new under the table, you know what you're going to see before the movie and if you're there it's because you're a fan of the saga of now eight movies.
The director Steven Caple Jr. knows how to take the story very well, even with the predictable that it can be, because he has adequate handling of the rhythm and the dramatic conflict. The fights are well mounted and sometimes feel more brutal than on other occasions thanks to the sound effects.
Stallone, who also serves as a co-writer, can play this role automatically and fulfills. Tessa Thompson is also charming as Creed's wife and Michael B. Jordan looks at the physical aspect and the choreography of the fights, although he is a bit over-acting in the dramatic aspect.
Special mention for the appearances of old acquaintances of the saga such as Dolph Lungren, Brigitte Bradoch and Milo Ventimiglia, who bring the nostalgia factor to the film.
If you have followed the Rocky saga you will enjoy this movie because it is very well made and it fulfills what it promises. If you expect to see something innovative and novel, you better look for other options.
I'm glad that Rocky Balboa is still among us to inspire and excite us."

","There are movies that have an unreasonably happy ending, that go out of their way to portray the protagonist as a super hero - for whom the unvierse conspires so that he/she can succeed.
Rocky series of films are not so happy go lucky after all, which has become thier USP of the sorts. For instance we have a very successful Mr. Balboa who blows up everything he has, looses his fancy house, has a son who doesn't want to become a boxer like him and eventually ends up training Creed's son, is now old and frail, fighting his way through cancer.
Sad to see Rocky so vulnerable in this film but this movie is not about him, it is about Creed, who will probably carry Rocky's legacy in more films to come in the future.
While Rocky trains and helps Creed win against Drago's son, he battles his own inner demons - keeping him away from his son.
While Drago still seething about his loss to Rocky, de-humanises his son's training, he comes to terms with his defeat and realizes what's more important to him - his son.
All of this is captured very beautifully in the film. So screenplay is definitely 9/10. Cinematography is 7/10 and acting is 7/10.
Happy watching!"

","It's been over 40 years since the multi-Oscar winning Rocky hit cinemas with the equally good Rocky II coming out shortly after however the series got a little bit silly with the fourth and fifth chapters. It wasn't until 2006 when the series was reinvigorated and brought back to its more grounded roots with Rocky Balboa which I highly recommend! The first Creed came out in 2015 earning Stallone a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination. It was a spinoff to the franchise but it still focused on plot lines from those films while also creating its own legacy. It made Michael B Jordan a star and he's certainly one of the best actors working today.<br/><br/>Starring Michael B Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Dolph Lundgren and Sylvester Stallone. Adonis and Bianca settle down and plan to get married but Ivan Drago comes back out of shadows to pit his son against Creed. Ryan Cooglar returns but only as executive producer, thankfully the tone he set with the first film still remains untouched here. First time director Steven Caple Jr does a fine job with it pushing great performances from everyone. The film looks and sounds great and he builds on the characters and develops their stories even further.<br/><br/>With a screenplay by Juel Taylor and Sylvester Stallone the writing is a little more clichéd but it feels more and more like the original franchise with nods to all of the earlier films. There are a lot of emotional scenes and some good character moments and it delves further into their past than the last film did. There is never a dull moment there is always something interesting happening that pushes the story forward. There are things that work better than the previous film but there are also a few things that drag it down like the repeated story elements. At times there's a feeling of Déjà vu as it's structured in a similar way to Rocky III - It shows him at the top of his game, then there is a mid section defeat where he has to pick himself up and he even goes to train in an isolated location.<br/><br/>Annoyingly Drago is still a man of few words and his son played by real life boxer Florian Munteanu is in every way the same. 30 years after losing the fight to Rocky, Drago has been cast out from society ever since. His own wife disowned him and their son and so there's a feeling of empathy for them both. The pair don't get much screen time but they still have a good story arc regardless and Dolph Lundren gives a much better performance than his last outing as Drago which was wooden by comparison. There is a lot of drama in the film and the fight sequences pack a real punch, the sound effects are so good with each punch sounding like they really hurt. Seeing Stallone and Lundgren share scenes together is every bit as intense as you would hope. There's also more chemistry between Michael B Jordan and Tessa Thompson who both give terrific performances.<br/><br/>The opponent from the last film was more one dimensional than the one here. With him being the son of the man who killed Apollo Creed, it makes the fight more personal and we learn a few things about him as the film progresses. Sly Stallone was great and he gets some emotional scenes often reminiscing events of his past but the film didn't really need his presence here. He just lingers around most of the time with nothing much to do but it's still good seeing him in the role of Rocky. The music score by Ludwig Göransson has some great themes to it but it doesn't quite capture the same feeling of the previous films. With hip hop tracks by artists such as Future, Meek Mill, and White Dave the soundtrack gives it a modern feel which will connect with new audiences. There is already talk of another Creed film where we see Clubber Lang (Mr T) make a return with his son, hopefully this doesn't happen because it will most likely ruin the franchise, Creed II was a great send off to the series."

","Its safe to say this story was inevitable once the character of Adonis Creed was conceived. At some point he was going to have come to terms with his father's death and the man who killed him as well, that meant revisiting the events of Rocky 4. The movie does not disappoint as far as have the entertaining elements of a Rocky or Creed movie. Any fan of the series should see it.<br/><br/>The only issue I had with this movie was how the character of Drago was written. I think humanizing him at the end by proving he really cared about his son when he threw in the towel in the second fight with Adonis was a nice touch in the story when Drago was more like a cyborg in Rocky 4. But in my view, it was done to late in the movie and felt sort of forced. Through most of the early stages of the movie Drago seemed mostly interested in revenge. In my view having him show his humanity a little at a time would have been a little more compelling and believable. The meeting with Rocky early could have been written better, and had Drago even expressed the slightest remorse for Apollo it would have made his humanization a little more complete.<br/><br/>Overall though, well worthwhile successor to Creed."
"secretzfan","7","0","0","18 December 2018"," Creed 2 beats the odds
","When the first Creed was released in theaters it had an explosion of success. With Coogler's expert direction the film managed to achieve an impressive amount of emotional depth from the audience. Every character interaction felt authentic, and you really could connect with them on some deeper more intrinsic level. Each of the fights carried with them some baggage that allowed us to really care about every confrontation.<br/><br/>With these high standards set it was easy to become hesitant of the second film's ability to live up to its predecessor. This only worsened when when Ryan Coogler made the decision to leave the project and so he could work on the now highly acclaimed ""Black Panther."" With so much going against the anticipated sequel one could come to believe that Creed 2 had a shot at becoming one of the worst movies of 2018 or at least the most disappointing.<br/><br/>Now after three years I can proudly say that Creed 2 does successfully capture the feeling of the first by choosing to be a story about a man becoming a father. Adonis's relationship with his wife, Bianca, is put to the test when Bianca gets pregnant with a baby. This is becomes a issue for the young Adonis as he wrestles with being a boxer and raising his son.<br/><br/>Things become increasingly more precarious when his father's killer, Ivan Drago, comes to town wanting a fight with Adonis pushing the young man to make some pretty tough decisions in his choice to avenge his father's name or to give it all up so that way he can be a husband to his wife and a father to his child. This becomes the emotional hook to carry the story and help us get more enraptured with these characters. In the end Creed 2 is a exceptional film with a lot of intense drama and truly impactful moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more."

"Sabre-El","9","0","0","16 December 2018"," How much punch does the same concept have? Answer: A lot
","After 7 movies based on characters centred around boxing, you would think it can't go on further and whether they can come up anything refreshing to keep the franchise going. But no, they somehow do manage to keep it alive. Not just alive, they manage to make us yearn for more!<br/><br/>This is how good the movie is. It has everything: great fights, drama, acting heart and fan-service. Creed 2 is as refreshing a sequel a franchise can get you. The story is very obvious: every person who has ever watched a Rocky movie, or any boxing or sports movie for that matter, would know how it would play out. And the plot was already given in the trailers. It is the tension, the drama and the stakes that really rake you in. The fight cinematography is superb and the viewer can 'feel' every punch being delivered. The director and crew get a big thumbs up for all this.<br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan does a wonderful job as Adonis Creed. He really lets his emotions out when the scene requires. Stallone is obviously awesome as Rocky. The characters that really make this movie special are Ivan Drago and his son, Viktor. The interaction between the two starts out as simple, but by the end it turns into something so special, it might be the best part of the movie. Viktor is amazing: he's huge, he's fast and he definitely looks dangerous. He is, however, not the robotic character Ivan was in Rocky 4. Even though he doesn't have much lines in the movie, the actor is able to portray all his emotions in the character quite well.<br/><br/>It is lovely to see Rocky and Ivan together on screen after decades. It is something all Rocky fans would have wanted. To add to the fan-service, there are appearances of characters from previous movies that one wouldn't have thought would ever appear in a 'Rocky' movie again.<br/><br/>There are a few complaints I have with Creed 2. It seemed a bit too fast paced. The movie explores different characters and touches on their issues. On each subplot, it does enough for the viewer to get interested, but then it (fast-)forwards and goes to another. I think the movie missed an opportunity to explore these subplots further and to give the viewer more of a chance to immerse him-/her- self in it. That subplot of Rocky 2, where he waits and prays anxiously while Adrian is in coma, is how it should have been done (Ok maybe a little less).<br/><br/>All in all, Creed 2 is one beautiful movie to watch. The ending of this movie is one of the best in the franchise. It is a must-watch for family and especially for fathers and sons to watch together. It is powerful enough to make a grown man cry, especially if he's a Rocky fan."

","So whatever freshness Creed brought to the Rocky universe-yeah, that's gone. Creed is now the epitome of this franchise- we get knocked down, we must get back up.<br/><br/>He has reached the highest success as a boxer, all that's left is fight the son of the man who killed his dad.<br/><br/>Rocky of course is here too and it's the layers of loss and loneliness Stallone has added to this character over the years that has made continuing this franchise worth it.<br/><br/>His relationship with Michael B. Jordan is great too- a blend of mentoring, friendship, jokes, and honest verbal fights on occasion that cut deep.<br/><br/>Stallone and Dolph Lundgren get one scene where we find Drago has lost everything except the ability to talk in complete sentences, which he seems to have gained.<br/><br/>These two will never appear together again except to stare each other down in the ring, where Drago pushes his son hard. The ring is where themes of fathers-sons-and legacies.<br/><br/>There's just as many fights as there are training montages. They're good but predictable and the occasional slo-mo punches don't hold a candle to the style Ryan Coogler brought to the first film.<br/><br/>The best thing about them is the focus on tactics, how do you take down a beast like Viktor Drago? That accompanied with the soundtrack is adrenaline-pumping enough to recommend.<br/><br/>A lot of this does follow the same formula though. There's revenge, there are many comparisons between Adonis and his father, there's an inner turmoil that needs to be overcome.<br/><br/>What could have been cool is actually giving Drago and his son a bit more personality.<br/><br/>But as is- Creed 2 is what you might expect. That's both something that works fine but also a bit of a disappointment.<br/><br/>If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more."
"Leofwine_draca","5","3","8","3 July 2019"," Past its prime...
","CREED II is yet another instalment in the spin-off franchise from the ROCKY series, with Sylvester Stallone playing his old role for supposedly the last time. The first CREED was okay as a spin-off, but this one stretches things too far despite having a decent premise. As a guy who loves ROCKY IV I was delighted to see Dolph Lundgren return to the franchise, this time as a proper actor rather than a mere musclehead. Sadly, the film is boringly shot and only comes alive in the on-fire boxing sequences, which are few and far between. All of the introspection and character building between the youthful characters is rather dull and tired, not to mention a retread of what's been done before in the ROCKY saga. Let's hope CREED II is the last outing for this former champion."

"burlesonjesse5","5","3","9","26 November 2018"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Creed II
","Ivan Drago has an offspring. He snarls, bulges, and fights like bull. Ivan's son Viktor wants a piece of Adonis Creed because Creed just became the non-lavished WBC World Heavyweight Champion. On a side note, about thirty years ago Ivan killed Apollo Creed (the father of Adonis) in a Las Vegas exhibition bout. There's some sentimentality here, some wonted unrealistic fight sequences, some minimal build-up, and a mask of predictability (you're a step ahead of all the characters about twenty minutes in). That's the flax of the inevitably modernized Creed II. It's my latest review.<br/><br/>Starring creaky Sylvester Stallone, megastar Michael B. Jordan, and alley-like returnee Dolph Lundgren, Creed II is the eighth installment in the juggernaut Rocky film series. Stallone is reliable and likable just like in the first Creed and Lundgren is surprisingly good as stone-faced Captain Drago (he emotes a little more this time with molten screen presence). As far as Rocky follow-ups go, ""II"" is earnest and zealous but it feels as though the filmmakers are trying to milk the Rocky storyline to its proverbial bone. These movies tend to make money so I guess the cash cow keep a cometh.<br/><br/>Anyway, Creed II has a story arc that resembles Rocky's II, III, and IV. And because Balboa is no longer wearing the groves and Max Kellerman is now doing some annoying boxer commentating (Kellerman is no Stu Nahan), ""II"" lacks the power, heightened sincerity, and invigorating nature of those earlier Rocky pics. Oh and what's with the limp musical score of Creed II that's hastily provided by Ludwig Goransson. You listen and ask yourself, ""where the heck is 76-year-old Bill Conti when you need him"" (where are county fair rock gods Survivor as well. Natch).<br/><br/>All in all, Creed II is directed by Cleveland, Ohio native Steven Caple Jr. Caple avoids adding too many stentorian fight sequences and instead opts for a dragged out situation drama that goes off into non-sparring tangents. He doesn't want ""II"" to be a popcorn-like, Tommy Gunn Rocky so I'll give him that much. Bottom line: There are hundreds of sequels that are worse than Creed II. That doesn't mean I'm gonna recommend it. ""I must break it."" Rating: 2 stars."
"Spanner-2","8","3","9","22 November 2018"," Solid franchise effort
","While not as good as the previous film, this one is still worth a viewing. Picking up the threads left by Creed this one is basically a sequel to Rocky IV... bringing back Dolph Lundgren, who looks terrific, as Ivan Drago who has trained his son for a shot at Creed's title. This one hits all the right beats. Stallone is still terrific in a role he has now played EIGHT (!) times, Michael B. Jordan is good as Creed and Lundgren provides more depth than he did in the original as the disgraced former boxer who is living a second chance through his son. Brigitte Nielsen even pops up in a couple of scenes, reprising her role as Drago's now ex-wife. The film hits all the predictable franchise notes but they still work.. and when the iconic Rocky theme pops up during the climatic fight scene it still stirs the heart strings. Tessa Thompson is under utilized in this one and some of the mid section drags but I liked the movie anyway."

If anything, it was a good final match even if it did feel more cinematic than real this time.<br/><br/>Of course, I can't end this review without talking about Ivan Drago. Honestly, there really isn't much. If I didn't know anything about Rocky 4, I would have forgotten all about him. I really didn't understand his motivations at all. He's mad because Rocky beat him and humiliated him? I highly doubt that was the case. Adonis Creed at least had a more believable motivation in the mix, however Viktor Drago didn't really have much personality for me to leave much of an impression. There's also a subplot with his mother that doesn't make too much sense.<br/><br/>Also the last time we left Rocky, he had cancer and it's briefly mentioned in this movie but really the whole movie is about him trying to reunite with his son. That's pretty much the arc of Rocky in this one besides him training Creed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this one just didn't have the same impact as the first Creed did. I was really looking forward to this one, but it just felt there. The matches just felt like they were there, but it didn't leave much of an impression for me. Hopefully the inevitable Creed 3 will be better."
"decarloj","7","2","5","23 November 2018"," It was more a Rocky sequel than a Creed sequel
","While the film had it's good parts, and the fight scenes were spectacular, it lacked the spark Creed had. That film was about Adonis, and his internal struggle to find his identity, while the sequel is mainly about his boxing career, which is why this is more like a Rocky sequel. I did like how in the end we finally saw Ivan as a human being, and not a cardboard villain. Brigitte Nielsen had a very effective cameo, in one of the films most emotional moments.<br/><br/>So all in all, if you're going into this movie expecting Rocky VII, you won't be let down."

I felt the script was written in a short time, the lack of good conversations made me cringe a bit and in the same time i had this deja-vu, why?! Because they recycled paragraphs from the previous movies, mostly Creed and Rocky 4. The movie was so predictable, at one point i was talking with my friend how we taught the end will be - we were right-.<br/><br/>Now let me tell you what i enjoyed. Michael's performance was superb, i really felt every emotion he had. The sound directing was ok-ish, i would have changed some things, but still quite good. In short, i think this movie had a big potential but ,ironic, it didn't took it. I would have liked to see Stallone a bit more in some crucial moments, but his presence made the movie 2 times better, i was really waiting for a motivational speech like the one he gave in Rocky Balboa (the best in my opinion) 7/10 Would watch again in the future."

","I'm so sick of these ostentatious reviews - either flaming with heat or slathering with praise. To be clear, I'm no critic but I'm not easily impressed and tend to judge movies accordingly. This isn't an Oscar winner. This isn't a better movie than Creed. This certainly isn't more entertaining than Rocky IV. But, if you liked the first one, this will certainly be watchable.<br/><br/>The biggest downfall of this movie, aside from the predictability, and boy is it ever predictable, is the matchup between Creed and Drago. Although there is backstory to lend credibility to this bout, it all comes off so forced. I think this is in part to Drago himself - who although a physical gargantuan, never seem to convey any real truth behind the motives of fighting Creed. They tried to capture the spirit of Rocky IV, but didn't come close to capturing it's magic.<br/><br/>Acting is good, music/soundtrack works well, cinematography is beautiful, the fights are engaging but I would tend to agree that the fights themselves are a bit sloppy and not technically tight. Again, this isn't movie of the year but more than a turn-your-brain-off summer blockbuster."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","6","25 November 2018"," more than adequate sequel, goes the distance and gets (enough) there
","In many ways, an objectively superior sequel in the Rocky series than Rocky IV, though it's (largely if not completely) missing that film's sense of bombast mixed with some WTF bits. You know the plot of this going on, and honestly you shouldn't really be trying to get something wholly *original* by the eighth Rocky film (or, I should say, Rocky IV: Part II, or The Next Generation, etc). With one small exception on a particular story beat, I called what would happen five minutes in.<br/><br/>In this case, that's fine: what matters is that the filmmakers give the actors some extreme-but-believable melodrama to play, and this does that in spades, and delivers on exciting fights that tell stories unto themselves (and boy these do, in some ways the fights are superior in choreography to the first Creed, if not, obviously Coogler lacking, better shot). As much as, again, Jordan and Thompson deliver, and Stallone continues doing some of his top-tier work in his flagship creation, I found the Dragos captivating most of all.<br/><br/>Here are our antagonists, out for payback on the newly crowned Adonis, and I'm sure somewhere (whether it got buried in another draft or survived here and I missed it I don't know) there's a message about Russia vs USA for this decade that is timely. But I completely understood them - Dolph gets to play a human being here, unlike in IV when he was a comical-sweaty-steroid-packed killing machine - and there's a message about what it means to be the losing side and living with that that makes this not a cookie-cutter narrative.<br/><br/>So it is manipulative, it isn't as earth-shattering as what Coogler did, but so what? It's highly enjoyable and packs heart where it counts as a drama long before it should be considered a sports movie (and that ending... Damn it, Sly, you're not gonna get to me, uh-uh, no sir....)"

"MGPT80","1","1","2","13 April 2020"," A grotesque abomination featuring one of the worst lead performances in recent memory
","If ever a film proved how important a good writer is, this was it. Creed (written by Ryan Coogler) was a surprisingly impressive regeneration of the Rocky movies and was generally lauded by critics and Rocky fans alike. Creed II (written by Stallone and Juel Taylor) however, is an absolute disgrace and should be wiped from the Hollywood hard drive.<br/><br/>Firstly, there was absolutely no reason to make this movie other than sheer greed. There were no loose ends to tie up and no characters to conclude.<br/><br/>The fight scenes, which were pretty good in Creed, regress back to the nonsense we saw in the original Rocky sequels. Hideous choreography and woefully unrealistic sparring sequences. And on top of that we had the commentators spoon-feeding the viewers what they should be feeling about every single exchange.<br/><br/>Something that plagued the early Rocky movies was the endless dialogue about nothing. It was little more than pop psychology being vomited onto the screen to be lapped up by head-nodding simpletons. This returned in full-force here and was not helped by the fact that the two main protagonists were the hopeless Tessa Thompson and the inexcusably bland Michael B Jordan.<br/><br/>How this guy landed such a huge role is a mystery to me. He was just about acceptable in the first movie where his age and naivety somewhat explained his insipid demeanour. But in this follow-up, which calls on him to step up and carry the film, he falls woefully short. And if the writers thought giving these two no-marks a deaf baby was going to make people resonate with them they were wrong. That was a desperate and pointless attempt at sentimentality and it backfired horribly.<br/><br/>I can't express how appalled I am that this was even made, let alone how bad it was. Stallone went out gracefully in Creed and the Rocky character was complete. Yet for some unknown reason, he couldn't help but yank back the scripts and churn out another schmaltzy mess.<br/><br/>One of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This is a little like two dads taking out their boxing career baggage with their son and mentee. Here's the boxer's baggage: Adonis Creed, son of fallen Apollo, ascends to heavyweight champ as the movies opens and soon after Viktor Drago, the son of the boxer who killed Apollo yet lost to Rocky, lobbies for a chance to fight Apollo's son 'Creed II' to make amends for the embarrassing loss his father took. Adonis also wants to fight Viktor to get revenge for his father's death. Let the boxing testosterone and blood flow! Who will emerge with their pride? Much of the story is Adonis maturing and his relationship with Rocky as well as Drago and his son's relationship. Overall, this MILKS the drama out of the large udder of an ultra-familiar plot. The boxing felt less believable conceptually and artistically as I could see the punches yet seeing or feeling the impact. Nothing surprising here yet was well-produced."

"LincolnHawks","8","1","2","28 April 2019"," If I can change, and you can change...
","After watching Creed 2, the second time around, I have a greater appreciation for it. I liked the character development of Drago and his son and Brigitte Nielsen's cameo. Drago character has much more dialogue and human emotion this time around, and I really like how they show what happened to him after his loss to Rocky. Other great moments, include the obligatory training montages, the return of many characters in Creed, the score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, and seeing Rocky reunited with Robert.<br/><br/>I felt a deleted scene from Rocky IV with Apollo, a voice over from Carl Weathers, or a flashback scene so Carl Weathers could some how reprise would of been a nice. Also the lack of remorse to Rocky about the death of Apollo from Drago is missing. Drago has so much development in this film, I felt this would of been a way to complete his character development,and show that he has changed as well. These missing elements make it difficult for me to rate it higher than a 8. It is a solid B.<br/><br/>That being said, all Rocky films are enjoyable, this one is no exception.

"tyrexden","6","1","2","28 February 2019"," Why wasn't it good? Let me explain.
","The 'look' and 'feel' of the film is well done. The directing and cinematography was above par. The story was good enough..... But ultimately, i found myself bored throughout the film. Why? What was wrong? Its not easy to put my finger on it, but if I had to throw out a theory, Michael B. Jordan is what was wrong, both portrayal and the writing of his character.<br/><br/>Look, he seems like a nice guy. He's fit. He's popular. I'm sure the ladies like to look at him... But he's not an actor. I won't even say that he's a 'bad' actor, because i don't find his film appearances to classify as acting, good, bad, or otherwise. He's a just a face. I can't really buy into the character, because its so surface level. There's nothing there. So, its not believable. Its almost cartoonish.<br/><br/>There's a problem, when the audience is exponentially more emotionally involved and empathetic to the Viktor Drago character, who is supposed to be the villain, and rarely even speaks! Even Ivan Drago was a character who the audience could relate to where he was coming from. But the Jordan character, carrying over the exact same drama from the first film, ""Why do you want to fight?"" ""I don't know"" themes get tiring. In fact, those same questions still haven't been answered. Even though the movie tries to show Jordan's motivations several times, never once are we led to any conclusion about his inner thinking.<br/><br/>I think everything i'm saying was a possible issue in the first film, but there was enough going on, that it wasn't a deal-breaker. But now, with a second movie, and the same issues, not addressed, it becomes a problem.<br/><br/>Just think of the other Rocky movies. Stallone is a good actor. The audience is emotionally invested. But can you honestly say that people 'like' the character of Adonnis Creed? There's nothing there."

For me, the best acting performances were inside of the ring instead of outside of it. The cinematography, boxing choreography, film editing and soundtrack inside the ring were even better than the first 2015 film. I didn't think that was possible to out do the boxing scenes of the 2015 film. Stallone shows us his mastery in building up tension and excitement not only through the boxing choreography between Michael B. Jordan and Florian Munteanu, but the camera that follow and rotate around both actors in the ring that give us the feeling of being in the ring with them.

","'It ain't about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit, and still get up. That's how winning is done.'<br/><br/><ul><li>Rocky Balboa, 1976</li></ul><br/><br/>
Ever since the first Rocky movie the series have been one of the most popular and most influential series of all time, and since 2015 in a new colour of Creed. In December we got to see the second adaptation of this action flick.<br/><br/>In Rocky (1976) we met Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) as opponent to protagonist Rocky (Sylvester Stallone). Now it's his son, Adonnis 'D' Creed (Michael B. Jordan) who's in the spotlight. In Creed (2015), directed by Ryan Coogler we saw a old and sick Rocky meeting main character Baby-Creed. With ex-champ Balboa as coach you see Adonnis fighting to the top, and Rocky fighting his disease.<br/><br/>This prequel however is even more personal. Rocky VI (1985) 'If he dies, he dies'. In the fourth adaptation of the Rocky movies Apollo Creed faces the Russian Ivan Drago. He doesn't survive the fight. Rocky defeats Drago later in the movie on own territory, and Russia turns against Drago. Now, 34 years later, Viktor, Ivan Drago's spn, challenges Adonnis for the title of Heavyweight World-Champion. But the title is not the only thing they're fighting for. Can Adonnis avenge his father? Or will Viktor earn back the respect of his country?<br/><br/>2018 was the year of Michael B. Jordan. In February he shined as antagonist in Marvel's Black Panther (also directed by Coogler) where he received an Saturn Award nomination for. He also got nominated for an Emmy for the by him produced TV-film Fahrenheit 451. And yet in Creed II he gives his best performance of the year. The chemistry between him and 3 time nominee Sylvester Stallone (who also wrote the screenplay) is even better than it is in the first movie. Jordan shows he can play the role of the victim as well as winner.<br/><br/>Despite it being the first big movie Steve Caple Jr. directs, he handles it like a professional. Loyal to the directing of both Stallone and Coogler, but with an own touch. Modern rap music processed un scenes like the training montage, or the, often literally, fall down, get up and run through. Building up tension with long takes, change between shots inside and outside the ring. A trademark of Coogler you can see back in this picture. Whether it has the same ambiance as the first Creed, is arguable, but Caple doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Creed II stays loyal to the storyline of the original Rocky movies, acknowledges the quality of previous directors, and has it's own touch. With excellent performances and a good storyline this films is absolutely recommended, especially when you're a fan of the other Rocky films.<br/><br/>9/10"
"tales77","6","1","2","27 January 2019"," Please somebody announce an Ivan Drago movie already!
","Huge Rocky fan here for the past 30+ years. This movie is not so bad, but being not so bad is not fair for anything Rocky related. First, the movie lacks in explaining (for ppl who don't know much about the Rocky universe) why Drago's son is feared besides being big. I don't remember now but I think we don't even have the name Apollo cited in the whole movie (maybe once). How come? Then, the reason for a second fight against Drago's son is almost non existent, being that an essential formula for the ""big fight"" in any of the Rocky films along the past decades. Then, along the movie we get the feeling that the main character is a weak unconfident and scared guy, totally different from the first movie and shows NOTHING of Rocky's or Apollo's characteristics. At the scene where we had Drago sitting in front of Rocky to have a talk I got so disappointed because Rocky just ignored everything Ivan said and went away, instead of replying back and give that moral lesson (see Rocky 6) that every Rocky movie has always granted us. When you are watching this you think you are watching a Rocky 4/for millenials because there is the whole ""they want you to fight in Russia"" thing but their training is in Arizona desert and you only know they are in Russia when the fighters are already in the ring. No snow, no planes landing on a different country, no reporters, no environmental scenes. Everybody knew yeah that Apollo's son would win the second fight, but why Ivan threw the towel to stop the fight? Apollo's son hadn't even finalized the guy yet, or had he? LoL. So many discrepancies on this I would never expect. Please please somebody announce an Ivan Drago movie!"

","Creed 2 (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Creed 2 packs a wild punch as a sequel based on a spin off on the Rocky series on the character Adonis Creed. Yes, the plot feels a little similar to the previous films. Creed (Michael B. Jordan) is having a great life with small boxing fights, moving to the next step with his relationship Bianca (Tessa Thompson) who's music career is taking off, and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) still helps him as a friend. In Russia, Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) and his son Viktor (Florian Munteanu) is rising up in the boxing world and plans to get respect back after being disgraced when his father lost to Rocky. Viktor plans to challenge Adonis Creed to a boxing match. Rocky hesitant on Creed taking the challenge after Ivan's fight with Adonis father did not end well and Rocky is still left a little scarred. Adonis will train himself and push harder to face against Viktor.<br/><br/>The plot was good. Similar to the previous films but it is about the inspirational story with Adonis Creed. The film may have a central theme about being a father figure and being there for family. With Adonis afraid of starting a family and inspired by his father. While Rocky is having a struggling relationship with his distant son. And Ivan trying to inspire his son Viktor. A lot of things is going and moving with the plot and its inspirational theme. The pay off with Adonis training after a brutal first fight with Viktor is spectacular. And the boxing fight with Adonis and Viktor is intense and brutal. You can feel the punches Adonis takes in and the strength to not give up.<br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan was great yet again. Sylvester Stallone aging as Rocky but delivers a great character. Tessa Thompson was great too. And has a couple of musical sequences with her singing career which was stunning. And Dolph Lundgren and Florian Munteanu were both great. More quiet type of characters but menacing from their facial performances.<br/><br/>Overall, Creed 2 is a good film. The story is inspirational with father themes. The acting was great. The training and fight sequences are intense and brutal. It may be a little long with its pacing but definitely a good movie."
"matthewssilverhammer","7","1","2","7 December 2018"," Solid
","2015's Creed gave us a soulful and original take on the Rocky universe, more closely resembling the poignancy of the 1976 original than its sequels. Creed II, however, buys fully into the idea of being a Rocky sequel: blunt force melodrama, strained relationships, numerous training montages, pride-comes-before-a-fall messaging, lots of hospital bed-side conversations, questioning legacies; it's all here. Luckily, just when the predictability seems to deliver a knock-out blow, Creed II stands itself back up with solid emotions and fantastic characters on both sides of the ring.
Adonis is presented with his ""toughest fight yet"" (aren't they all?) when Viktor Drago, son of Russian boxer and Apollo Creed killer Ivan Drago, emerges to challenge him to a championship fight. It's a follow-up to Rocky IV, but its story is simply a mirror of Rocky III. Neither of those sequels are particularly great, but at least in IV we're given a parallel to real-world conflicts, namely the Russian-American cold war struggle. Creed II was primed for a similar treatment, given the current state of American-Russian affairs, but instead opted for a safer, smaller story about drive and legacy.
This film does, however, continue the fruitful series-through-line of living with patriarchal expectations and breaking generational wrongs. The hot-headed and uncomfortably human Adonis is such a brave protagonist choice for this series, following the gentle, unassuming nature of Rocky.
In all the highs-and-lows of this franchise, the enduring nature of the Rocky universe is like a gift to movie-lovers. A faithful comfort food that has managed to stay vibrantly relevant for over 40 years, and one I'd be happy to continue revisiting, even if it never quite reaches the heights of Rocky or Creed again."

I'm in the second camp, I love rocky 4.<br/><br/>To have a film reference something classic from 1985 in 2018, making it work on all levels, proves how well crafted this is.<br/><br/>Stallone proves a humble creator, handing the baton on to the next generation with elegance. While our leading man and his family struggles work perfectly to balance the heart and mind of our main man.<br/><br/>Even Dolph, who I've always loved, puts in an emotional performance with a limited script, burying his demons through his sons talents and drive.<br/><br/>If you're a true rocky fan, this shouldn't disappoint!

While the film echoes Rocky II and Rocky IV the overall result is an entity all itself thanks largely to a smart and lean script by Stallone (who co-wrote with Juel Taylor) and an even keeled direction by Steven Caple, Jr. Jordan and Thompson have chemistry to spare and Stallone elicits some deep low-key acting moments of poignancy and tenderness."

","For once, it kinda reminds you of the 80's US vs Russia/Soviet theme that runs in so many Hollywood movies back then where the ever brutal, spartan-like ideology of the USSR comes face-to-face against the compassionate heroism of USA, but as the story goes the deeper, we'll find out that the even the challenging main antagonist has his own background that humanizes the supposed-to-be-monster character. This is what the new movie of the Rocky-verse has where the old one almost don't: the more we dig deep down the monster's history, the more we sympathize, and the more we realize that the antagonist is actually the dark-side of the protagonist had he put in the same circumstance.<br/><br/>On top of that, scores and the original soundtracks resonates really well with the culture this movie and it's prequel represent, just like Michael B. Jordan's other movie, Black Panther. The training scene is as moving as the ones in the previous Rocky movies, to the point that it almost makes me think that Jordan (as Adonis Creed) wasn't even acting since he is a real-life boxer.<br/><br/>In my most humble opinion, the movie would've been perfect if, before meeting Drago's son, Adonis fought his way back to the top of his performance by beating much and much small fries (compared to the real monster, Viktor Drago), and the same goes both way for Viktor, emphasizing the mirror effect on each other's character. and one more thing: the ending, like any other tournament movies, the ring boxing (and everything that's happening on it) should've been the last place the camera shot before switching to the end credits, instead of a graveyard (oops, Spoiler Alert!!)."

Warner's seers warn us that IF America allows a Moscow pawn in our Oval Office to duck the KGB challenge, the World will vacate America's title and award it to the Chinese who are now waiting in the wings to triumphantly slurp through America's drinking straw! However, SHOULD we destroy Russia's paper grizzly bear NOW--as ""Adonis"" takes down Viktor--China will run home with its tail dragging."
"TheMovieDoctorful","10","1","2","4 December 2018"," Vintage Meets Modern In This Brilliant Sequel
","In an age of constant reboots, Creed II is the franchise movie we both need and deserve; it neither panders to millenials to appear ""hip"", nor trashes its less popular entries in a desperate attempt at validation for elitist fanboys, nor rehashes the original film to satisfy a misplaced sense of nostalgia. Instead, it's a film that loves its franchise for reasons of merit beyond those superficially applied by those outside the true fandom. Creed II is the Attack of the Clones of the Rocky franchise. If you know my stance on Attack of the Clones, you'll know that title is nothing but complimentary. The basis of this argument being that both are sincere tributes to vintage film (40s-60s cinema for Clones, 70s-80s cinema for Creed) with modern filmmaking conventions. (State of the art CGI for AOTC, modern rap and R&B discography for Creed, advanced fighting choreography and modern characterization for both.)<br/><br/>Creed II and Attack of the Clones also both make the effort to critique the toxic and negative affects of being raised in a society that values you only for your abilities. Viktor Drago's manipulations and emotional abuse at the hands of his trainers and extended family keep him underdeveloped both socially and emotionally. He is a tool to them, a prize bull much in the same manner Anakin Skywalker was to the Jedi Council. Though Viktor is very much the antagonist of the film, he remains deeply sympathetic. In previous Rocky films, I always knew whose side I was on. In Creed II, I had no desire to see Viktor defeated or sent home to the shame of the ones who claimed to value him. Ivan Drago is similarly human; a victim of systemic abuse and manipulation who has inadvertently brought his son into the same abusive, destructive cycle. Contrary to popular opinion, Drago definitely had sympathetic qualities in Rocky IV. Here, however, is where we see them fully realized. Adonis Creed is an equally complex character, his sensitive, awkward and almost feminine nature out-of-the-ring is intriguingly paradoxical to his more masculine sense of ego and all-consuming need for victory and validation. His relationship with Rocky takes on an Anakin/Obi Wan angle, the reckless and rebellious apprentice to a strict and overly protective father figure. Even the lovely Bianca Taylor seems fairly reminiscent of Clones' Padme Amidala, a deeply pragmatic, wise and mature professional slowly learning to open up more emotionally and grow more human. She retains an oddly dominant role in her relationship with Adonis, a far cry from the more traditional gender values of Rocky & Adrian's relationship in the original Rocky films (This is hardly a slight against that romance, which was indeed quite sweet, merely an observation.)<br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan gives the performance of his career here. Creed II is a much darker film than its predecessor with higher emotional stakes and Jordan definitely understands that in his commanding, powerful acting here. His more confident and impassioned delivery in public constrasts wonderfully with his more shaky, nervous and awkward delivery around Bianca, wonderfully conveying a man whose confident in his athletic abilities, but insecure in his role as a husband and father. His facial acting is absolutely tremendous as well, his distraught and horrified expressions in the Hospital scene reacting to Rocky's previous abandonment are some of the best acting of the year.<br/><br/>It's Dolph Lundgren, however, who steals the show in the acting department. He proves here that he's far more than just chiseled muscle, his tormented and nuanced facial expressions and sorrowful eyes giving Drago a real sense of emotional and ethical conflict we only saw glimpses of before. His vocal delivery has more pathos and pain than we've seen from the character before, even in his more cocky or angry moments, his insecurity from abandonment and the guilt over his past and what he's done to his own son still hangs over his vocal performance. This is a smarter, more broken, more human Drago than we could have ever expected following his brutal killing of Apollo Creed in Rocky IV. His tortured reaction to his son Ivan's fight with Adonis almost made me feel guilty for not rooting for him.<br/><br/>The rest of the case fares wonderfully. Tessa Thompson brings an extremely commanding screen presence and aura of strength to her role (Not to mention a perfect singing voice. I Will Go To War is Academy Award for Best Song material), Sylvester Stallone perfectly balances between dopey comedic timing and honest emotional poignancy, even first time actor Florian Munteanu does an excellent job portraying the angst and loneliness of the son forced to carry his father's sins. I almost feel bad singling out Lundgren and Jordan when every actor here is clearly excellent.<br/><br/>The romance in Creed II feels especially reminiscent of the aforementioned Attack of the Clones, which is a good thing. The adorable awkwardness of Adonis and Bianca's interactions and the innocence of their relationship is unexpected and refreshing in a film like this, subverting the expectations of a cliched, boring ""jock and R&B star"" love story. Despite (Or possibly because of) their fame, both Adonis and Bianca are somewhat socially stunted, which lends a real sincerity to their more romantic and loving moments. It only helps that Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson have precious chemistry.<br/><br/>While not quite reaching the heights of Ryan Coogler's 2015 film, Creed II is still an emotional, dark, thoughtful and mature sequel and one of the best films in the franchise. Anybody considering themselves a fan of the series, anybody who considers themselves a sports movie fan, should count this as a must watch."
"matthewtweed2","10","1","2","4 December 2018"," This movie is unreal!
","I love the Rocky franchise, arguably excluding the weird 5th instalment. Even Rocky Balboa (6) was great, stupid.... okay sure a bit stupid, a pensioner wants to fight the champion because of a virtual fight where he wins at the age of 60 something, so the champion accepts to prove he can beat a pensioner and then the pensioner proves that heart can overcome arrogance... I digress, it just works!<br/><br/>Where Creed is different, Adonis is damaged in a way that Michael B Jordan portrays far too well. Rocky is relegated to the role of walking fortune cookie which is great. The beauty of this Is, Rocky IV suspended disbelief, are we really to believe that a, seemingly, invincible fighter who murdered a champion with his bare hands can be beaten because some smaller dude flipped some tired and ran a lot in Russia? Sure it worked but really?<br/><br/>First of all, they made Viktor Drago a machine... but a machine with flaws and humanity. This made it believable that Adonis could really beat him. They also didn't lower Dragos standard to meet Creeds, he fought the same in both fights, instead they completely changed Adonis' fighting style and used strategy.<br/><br/>I will be watching again, amazing! Great work."
"MovieNinjaGuy","6","1","2","4 December 2018"," Good but a missed opportunity at excellence.
","I've been a massive fan of the Rocky franchise all my life. The end of Rocky 1 still brings me to tears. Just watched it again the other week.<br/><br/>Whilst Creed 1 was a great continuation of the Rocky franchise I reckon Creed 2 is barely as good as Rocky 5 in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie leaves far too many things lingering along (child / marriage) for no reason and then does things in a similar fashion as Rocky 4 for no reason (second fight in Moscow - why? Why not Las Vegas as THAT would have been the best homage to Creed's dad). It seems the movie is sometimes confused between what happened between Creed and Drago and what happened with Rocky and Drago. Thus the revenge thing just makes no sense.<br/><br/>Once again we get a movie in a Hollywood franchise that throws out the story telling conventions that have worked since the 70s for no reason (As Star Wars 8 did - no time jump there). Creed 2 should have began with the end of Creed 1 fight + success montage leading into championship win and then end in the ring. Absolutely no reason why it couldn't have been done that way. Instead it feels like messy screenplay. Fixing that wouldn't have changed the story one bit.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the desert camp thing. Felt very unlike Rocky / Mickey training routines.<br/><br/>Shame, the tools were all there. I personally would have split it into two movies for year between back to back release as then Creed could have been a finished trilogy. Empire Strikes Back / Infinity War shows audiences are accepting of a negative cliffhanger. Heck even Back to the Future 2 does that well.<br/><br/>Bring back the classic trilogy hero's journey in movies:<br/><br/>1) Introduction of characters with stakes clearly shown, ties things up somewhat but leaves us with opportunity for more
2) Main character revels in success of part 1 perhaps but is soon brought down to earth. He isn't ready to overcome the biggest trial. He reaches absolute lowest point of his journey by the end. In Creed 2 this could have been the first Drago defeat and Rocky not being there. Only for this to be reversed in the sequel after some gut wrenching training and fixing of a broken body.
3) Return of the hero, overcoming the greatest trial and restoring peace."

","So here I am typing away at a review of a film which I thought was bloody brilliant. This film had me hooked from the moment it started and I thought that was amazing. The camera shots they used were suitable. They used too much shaky cam which was good but for some it may have been nauseating. The film gave me good roles which had meaning. Michael B Jordan's character had a good arc and so did Dolph Lundgren. The movie had a lot of themes revolving around it such as Hope, Fame, and Honour which I thought was fine. But overall I think everyone should watch this film as it contains a little cameo at the end of the film (if you have watched every single Rocky film including Rocky Balboa."

"ricardo914","9","1","2","3 December 2018"," Does everything you could ask for
","The Rocky franchise lives on with Michael B. Jordan, who gives a phenomenal performance as Adonis Creed. As usual, Sly does his job on his iconic role of Rocky. Despite being formulaic, this is the first in the rocky franchise where both sides are represented, that of creed and that of drago. This worked because it didn't recognize Drago only as some guy who punches hard, but rather someone you can feel sympathy for. Overall, Creed 2 is a worthy sequel and successfully finalizes the story of Ivan Drago from Rocky IV"

"renofhate","10","1","2","2 December 2018"," Truly fitting and enjoyable sequel
","I wanna start off by saying that Creed II is nothing short of greatness and that it's a very good and fitting sequel to its predecessor, the first Creed movie from 2015. Although I'd say Creed is the better of the two films, not by much, however, I will still admit that Creed II gets almost a perfect rating from me. I would say its fight choreography, cinematography and acting are all spectacular and wonderfully done. The progression is fantastic and we see Adonis Creed go from underdog and good boxer to heavyweight champion and true fighter.<br/><br/>The antagonist, I found, is really good. It's hard to say if he makes for a better villain than that of ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan from Creed, so I would probably say they're equal. Viktor is a conquering, fierce, vicious villain whose input and training from his father knows no bounds nor limits. It was brilliant seeing Drago return and, although this is a spoiler-free review, I will say that he definitely speaks a lot more in this film (but that's a given, really). Ivan Drago is more experienced and wise in this film of course as it's 33 years later, but the change in his character is terrific.<br/><br/>Rocky, of course, is great in the film (as are the co-stars; they're all really good). Stallone's portrayal of elder Rocky Balboa is brilliant in both movies and I love that they center around his character most after Adonis. The bond between him and Adonis is one of my favourite things about the Creed films. So awesome.<br/><br/>For me, personally, I genuinely couldn't have asked for a better sequel. I enjoyed every minute of it, both times I saw it, and I honestly hope they make this into a trilogy cause I'd love to see at least one more film. Solid acting, direction, choreography/cinematography, and the rivalry throughout the movie is superb. There really isn't anything more I could ask for. Its ending is particularly fantastic, at least I would say so, despite having seen others say it's predictable. Does that really matter? The film is nonetheless a stellar and really enjoyable sequel with a lot of amazing things happening all-round.<br/><br/>Creed II - Solid 9.6/10"

"stevenrotherforth","10","1","2","1 December 2018"," Better than the first? I think so!
","Creed II<br/><br/>I'm probably one of the very few people that actually enjoyed Creed II more than the original.
Considering I gave the first Creed movie a 10/10 score on IMDB this sequel exceeded all my expectations.
Formulaic it may be but when you have a formula as tried and tested as the Rocky franchise then this is no bad thing.
Creed II is a hugely exciting movie. One that only works if you have seen Rocky IV and understand the history and rivalry of the Creed's and the Drago's.<br/><br/>Adonis Creed played brilliantly again by the always likeable Michael B Jordan is the newly crowned Heavyweight champion of the world.
His life is rocked when he is challenged by the son of the man who infamously killed his father in the ring.
A challenge that Adonis cannot decline even if it jeopardises his friendship with long time trainer Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>Director Steven Caple Jr has delivered a movie that could have been ridiculously contrived and cheesy but instead is totally believable.
We the audience are convinced by some solid storytelling that Ivan Drago and Apollo Creed did actually fight each other thirty three years ago and Drago did kill Apollo.
This film works because of strong character development.
The Drago family is fleshed out offering a view point from their side of the fence.
The story arcs of each individual urges the audience to invest heavily in what is transpiring on screen.<br/><br/>Creed II is a tremendous looking film and Caple Jr's picture is being unfairly compared to Ryan Cooglers work on the first film.
Ok there may not be some of Cooglers interesting camera work that graced the first film but Caple Jr still handled this film with expertise.
Shots like the underwater pool scene is stunning and the director certainly knows how to sell a punch!
Each landing blow can be felt.
The blows are devastating not only because they are physically powerful but because they're emotionally powerful too.
We the audience feel the blows because we are made to care.
This once again down to the strong character development, direction and performances by all<br/><br/>Stallone is again perfect as Rocky and Jordan is real star material.
As for the Drago's, Dolph Lundgren gives probably the best performance of his career as a bitter and weathered Ivan. His country tossed him out like garbage after his loss to Balboa.
Florian Munteneu as Viktor Drago is a locomotive with menacing screen presence.
He may not be experienced as an actor but his pectorals do all the talking he needs.
A huge tank of a man that looks way too big and strong for Adonis Creed.
Stellar support from Tessa Thompson adds to the dynamic of this movie.
Her relationship with Adonis goes further to strengthen this films believability.
Subplots involving the two make this like the original Rocky movie much more than just a film about boxing.<br/><br/>Creed II is going to be a movie that will transfer
beautifully on to Blu-ray.
Projected on to a cinema screen the picture looked sharp and colours popped.
I can only imagine how splendid this will look in UHD HDR.
Sound quality should be another highlight. In the cinema each punch had a delicious thud that I believe will give any decent subwoofer a good workout.<br/><br/>Creed II was marvellous!
Should they continue with the franchise or let it rest?
Of course they should continue. I'd pay to see more."

Dolph slips back into character as Ivan Drago brilliantly and Stallone....well stallone is Rocky at this point and his heart felt presence is as powerful as ever, this sequal is far superior to its predecessor ""creed"" , my only question is, where can they go from here?

"maurice_yacowar","8","1","2","1 December 2018"," Rocky helps Adonis Creed avenge father Apollo's fatal defeat.
","The new Rocky franchise movie doesn't open on the Rocky world but in the Ukraine. It focuses on the defeated Russian Ivan Drago and his bigger-chip-off-the-old bloc son Viktor. Coming to see a Rocky flick we're jolted to start in Drago's world. But then we're not living in the original Rocky's world either. America is no longer the America - Nam war America - in which Rocky first taught his lesson that sometimes you don't need to win. It's enough to survive.
Present America has nothing of the hope, integrity and purpose that marked even that fractured America. As America seems outside ""America"" this chapter starts in Kiev.
The strain of being outside is arguably the film's driving theme. We meet Adonis Creed as he's winning the heavyweight boxing title. But he feels no security in that No.One ranking, because he's immediately challenged by Viktor, son of the Drago who a few movies ago killed Creed's father Apollo.
Rocky himself is always outside, hoping to come in. We hear him before he walks on camera. The three-step climb into the ring is momentous, he intones. He lives a solitary life in a plain Philly apartment, with only Adonis to care for him. He lives like he lived at the outset, a loner, tossing his ball, crumpled hat and slouch. He owns a restaurant (Adrian's) but he comes in at night to punch the dough - that's all he kneads.
Rocky has three emotional climaxes in the film: (i) the birth of Adonis's daughter, his god-daughter; (ii) Adonis beating (spoiler alert) Viktor; and (iii) his own, long-alienated son greeting him at his door with ""You want to come inside?""
Here everyone wants to come inside. Adonis feels twice compelled to fight Viktor because he has no other connection to his dead dad. He takes Rocky's initial refusal to train him for the ill-advised fight as a personal betrayal, a father's expulsion. In the (yeah, maudlin but hey...) graveyard scenes Rocky and Adonis soliloquize a connection to a dear departed. They need to feel in their dead family member's presence.
As it happens, Adrian remains a stronger presence in Rocky's life than Drago's wife is. She deserted her husband on his loss and repeats that when son Viktor seems about to lose.
Adonis's sweetie Bianca is a partially deaf professional singer. Their born-deaf daughter starts another kind of outsiderhood. But her mother and - thanks to Rocky's tutorial on fatherhood - her father will totally embrace and include her.
Bringing in the excluded extends to the actors as well as to the characters. In addition to Rocky and the Creed family, the resurrections include Dolph Lundgren as Drago dad, Brigitte Nielsen (Stallone's Ex) as Drago's Ex, and Milo Ventimiglia as again Rocky's son Bobby.
Paradoxically, our climactic sight of Rocky has him contentedly on the outside. His boy Adonis is in the chaotic ring celebrating his triumph. Rocky sits in ringside, taking it all in from a lower distance, detached, his back to us with ""Creed"" emblazoned on his jacket. Not Rocky but Creed. His ego is content, His creed has won another. He's not in the ring because he has nothing to prove. Except for his suspended fatherhood."

","Hi ELLIOT GJAZZ here. Just saw CREED2. If there was an Oscar for moody pouted lips , then this would sure win it. Sly, Mikey, Dolph, Florian, Woody all pouted as if they were born that way, hell even the girls Tessa ( incidentally who I liked in THOR RAGNAROK ) and BIG BRIGITTE pouted a little as well. Bruce Willis Mr. pout himself wouldn't have had a look in. The only actor who cracked a smile was Russell Hornsby ( who i saw last in Fences and The hate you give, and was ex in both ).
After I saw ROCKY in 1976 , I went out and bought the soundtrack album as soon as it was available. The brilliant Bill Conti ( responsible for many great soundtracks of which my favourites were GLORIA 1980 and AN UNMARRIED WOMAN 1978 ). I came out the cinema humming GONNAE FLY NOW, which I thought was an extremely original piece. I was at that time into Jerry Goldsmith, John Barry, Michel Legrand, Quincy Jones , John Williams, Lalo Shifrin and many others who I am nuts about. Bill's music was new and different. GFN was used many times in the film, with variants on the theme , however the actual main theme when he was running up the steps is best well remembered. Bill Conti also co wrote some nice soulful songs for the film which again complemented the film well.
Here's the thing after seeing CREED 2 , I wasn't that keen on the constant rapp music, I know it's what the young people are into these days, but it could have done without it. It was a nice Score by LUDWIG GORANSSON . As well as his own composition he did variants on Bill Conti's original Rocky themes, there
Just wasn't enough of that in the film.
Anyway back to the FILM . Solid Performances, from all the cast, the fight scenes were done really well, I felt however it was a little slow and the story kind of not realistic enough for me. I do not like to give away Spoilers unlike Mark Kermode , so I won,t. When I go to a film , I want to come out feeling invigorated, like I did recently with THE HATE U GIVE, sadly with this film I did not."

"MrDHWong","9","1","2","29 November 2018"," A solid follow-up to its predecessor and a great boxing film in general
","Creed II (a.k.a. Rocky VIII) is the sequel to 2015's Creed and the eighth installment in the Rocky film franchise. Starring Michael B Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, and Dolph Lundgren, it is a solid follow-up to its predecessor and a great boxing film in general.<br/><br/>Three years after the events of the previous film, Adonis Creed (Michael B Jordan) has won several boxing matches to become the World Heavyweight Champion. However, Adonis' celebration is short lived as Viktor Drago (Florian ""Big Nasty"" Munteanu), the son of Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), steps forward to challenge him. Despite the refusal of support from his trainer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), Adonis decides to accept the challenge as a means to get revenge against Viktor's father Ivan for killing his father 33 years prior.<br/><br/>Still as feel-good as the Rocky films as can get, Creed II matches its predecessor in just about every way possible. Michael B Jordan is once again fantastic in the title role and he does a superb job holding the viewer's attention throughout the story. His scenes with Tessa Thompson were so touching and added a necessary degree of sweetness to the film that was often needed. Sylvester Stallone is also great as the elderly Rocky Balboa, and despite being limited to a supporting role, he still manages to have a memorable role in the story, especially when seeing him go eye-to-eye with his old nemesis Ivan Drago. In terms of plot, the film is an amalgamation of Rocky III and Rocky IV and while some outcomes were fairly predictable, there are still the occasional surprises to keep the audience on their toes. The only major complaint is that Viktor Drago's character wasn't developed as well as he should have been. There was only really one important scene of dialogue with him and his father but for the most part it just seemed like the only reason he was in the film was to be used as vessel for his father to channel his grudge against Rocky in the boxing ring. Overall, this is a solid sequel and a worthy eighth film featuring the character of Rocky Balboa and it would certainly be interesting to see where the franchise goes from here.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

"KahlilHerring","7","2","7","22 November 2018"," Creed 1 was a KNOCKOUT, while Creed 2 is an Uppercut
","Act 1 was inconsistent as it tried to recapture the magic that Creed 1 showcased so effortlessly. The tracking shots Coogler is known for doesn't have the same effect as it did in the first one. And it feels like this entire fight is contrived and relies more on the DRAGO shock factor rather than building unto the character of Creed instead they kept him stagnant until certain things happen. And those certain things happen REALLY FAST. (No SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Act 2 was okay at best. One of the big differences from this movie versus the last one is that in the first one all the actors had room to breathe and actually act. This movie especially in the second act sets up the characters for that but doesn't really give them the screen time they needed. We see Creed basically get to rock bottom but the film doesn't expand on that and dedicates maybe a scene to that situation and then it just moves along. While somehow and someway they're able to build on Drago's story and make Viktor more likeable and I feel for him more than I do for Creed. Not necessarily a bad thing but a thing I noticed.<br/><br/>Act 3, in which the movie finally feels like a CREED movie. It captures some of the magic from the first Creed and the emotions and stakes are really high for both fighters. Can't say much without spoiling but this act is really good.<br/><br/>Overall I feel like they rushed to put 2 movies into 1 instead of doing what a Rocky 1-3 did. The script lacked here and the acting was a step down from last movie. This includes all cast members surprisingly except the mother. There wasn't enough time to process what was actually happening in Creed's life while juggling other subplots and they TRIED to match the tone of Act 3 the entire movie but it didn't work. Still an enjoyable movie and worth the watch if you want to continue the Creed story"

With that being said, I'm happy to say that this is a very good squeal that matches and even surpasses its predecessor in some ways.<br/><br/>The main thing that I liked about this movie were the personal scenes. The fight scenes and the training montages are good, but the standout moments are the ones between Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson, and the moments where we further explore each and every character. When it comes to the fight scenes and overall excitement, the first Creed has this movie beat, but when it comes to the personal moments and the emotional impact, this movie is the champion."

","I've finally gone the distance with the Rocky franchise, watching Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V, Rocky Balboa, Creed and Creed II almost back-to-back. The fact that I have been able to do so without throwing in the towel is testament to the brilliance of the original format, to which the sequels remained fairly faithful: gritty drama, likeable characters, a lot of pathos, and stunning fight action, with a training montage or two along the way for good measure.<br/><br/>Creed II doesn't break the mould, but it doesn't need to, because the formula still works, albeit with the focus now on Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), with Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) in the corner as his trainer. When Creed is pitted against Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), son of Ivan Drago, the man who killed his father, Rocky refuses to train him for the match, considering his opponent to be too dangerous. Inevitably, Creed is beaten to a pulp by the angry Russian, only hanging on to his title by way of a disqualification, and his pride is hurt almost as badly as his body. As Creed soul searches and returns to health, he must also contend with becoming a new father, his baby girl born with a hearing defect.<br/><br/>Knowing that he will never be happy until he has stepped out of his father's shadow and created his own legacy, Creed agrees to a rematch with Drago, this time with Rocky as his trainer (the Italian Stallion regretting that he wasn't there for the first fight).<br/><br/>Packing an emotional wallop as well as many physical ones, Creed II is a belter of a film, with plenty of heart-warming drama leading up to the inevitable showdown set in Moscow, where the titular character finally gets to prove to himself that he more than just his father's son. It's engrossing stuff from start to finish thanks to excellent performances and sharp direction from Steven Caple Jr., but it is the titanic battle between Adonis and Viktor that seals the deal: it's hard hitting, bloody, and superbly choreographed, with stunning cinematography and that awesome 'spaghetti western' score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. Then comes the moment that the iconic Rocky theme music kicks and Adonis belts seven shades of the proverbial out of Viktor, and the crowd goes wild! Predictable, perhaps, but still a winner."

","Sylvester Stallone is once again making another movie from Rambo franchise entitled,""Rambo:The Last Blood"" which will be shown on September 2019. I just saw the trailer and it shows that Stallone is trying to make another movie of his iconic roles.When Rocky VI a.k.a Rocky Balboa was made,I thought that Stallone would finally say goodbye to Rocky.But apparently,he isn't saying goodbye as he once again made Creed.When it did well in the box office,he once again made another sequel entitled,""Creed II"".<br/><br/>""Creed II"" stars Michael B. Jordan in the title role as Adonis Creed,the illegitimate son of Rocky's opponent,Apollo Creed. He co-stars with obviously Stallone and Tessa Thompson. In this movie,it also stars Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago. It was obvious that the movie will have themes from the Rocky franchise with the presence of Drago and his son,Victor. It was evident that it will comes with the match of both Adonis Creed and Victor Drago in the ring.As expected,anyone who has seen the Rocky franchise particularly ""Rocky IV"" knows what to expect on the emotions on this upcoming bout. Added to that,we also witness how Adonis is affected by his new found fame after he became a boxing champion. Finally,we also get to witness how a person cannot escape one's family history.In short,the movie has a little theme from ""Rocky III"" and a lot of themes from ""Rocky IV"".<br/><br/>It is apparent that the movie did well in the box office.With that in mind, we get to witness that Stallone will continue to portray Rocky until the end of his life.Knowing that he is a limited actor who lives by Rocky and Rambo,he will definitely continue with this Rocky spin-off franchise.<br/><br/>Going back to the ""Rambo:The Last Blood"",Stallone stated that he is doing his final film as John Rambo BUT if it does well in the box office,he will continue portray Rambo. Apparently,that has already applied to his other iconic role,Rocky with the Creed franchise."
"dchowdhuryfilms","1","1","3","1 July 2019"," Greed 2
","Here's how dumb this movie is:
Tessa Thompson asks Donnie if he took a s**t (reference to first Greed), but that happened before the fight with Leo. He then went on to fight Conlon and he's had six fights since fighting Conlon...why is she asking this now? Obviously as an in-joke but you see it makes no sense as a joke but it does forewarn you of similar nonsense to come...<br/><br/>Ivan Drago got his comeuppance in Rocky IV. Yet here he is again still the bad guy. No change. No growth, even though we saw him change during Rocky IV as he fought to think for himself. Greed 2 just forgets that and has him repeat his mistakes and beats on him all over again via his hard-working son.<br/><br/>Adonis is a boy. A temper tantrum child. He can do nothing without Rocky holding his hand and when Rocky does refuse to hold his hand he throws his toys out of the pram.<br/><br/>Apollo had two legitimate children seen in Rocky 2. Where the hell are they in all this? Adonis didn't even know his dad so what's his beef with the Drago's? Why does Drago want to bear Adonis so bad? He already killed his father. It would have made for a more interesting story had Drago come to apologize to Adonis for what he did to Apollo and it would have showed some depth of character but oh no, he had to be the bad guy.<br/><br/>Rocky keeps spouting these 'profound' speeches whenever he opens his mouth. It's like he swallowed a book of profound sayings. I don't recall Mickey talking like this. Only in Rocky 5 (the worst of the series at the time) did he start talking like Buddha. It's like Rocky wants to be profound and deep. Do you remember Rocky 1 ever being profound and deep? Through action yes but never through their mouths.<br/><br/>The fights lacked any energy. Even cheering from the crowd seemed lack lustre. There was no excitement. No anticipation. The score was totally forgettable.<br/><br/>It is what it says it is: Greed 2. A cash grab, nothing more."

It has depth and emotion and real characters with real flaws. Magnificently directed, great acting (is it possible that Stallone got better with age, or is it just the many stereotype roles he's played have betrayed his real acting talent, as shown in Cop Land.) Creed 2 is fantastic. A truly great boxing movie and a credit to all concerned.

The main characters except for Rocky aren't really likable characters, Adonis Creed just doesn't have the same charisma Rocky has. I think this idea had potential and this could have been a really good movie, it's one of those movies you're really hyped about and then fails to meet your expectations.

"tomgillespie2002","7","1","3","11 March 2019"," Surprisingly emotional, exciting and joyous
","One of the many surprise pleasures of Ryan Coogler's Creed was not only its ability to find much life in what was a tired, decades-sprawling franchise, but the way it managed to add emotional weight to the events of Rocky IV, a crowd-pleasing fan-favourite that remains the cheesiest and most ridiculous entry into the series to date. While the death of Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed was shocking and unexpected, it was followed by an air-punching victory for the Italian Stallion underdog during which he also won the Cold War for the U.S., all backed to the most 80s of soundtracks. By following the early career of one of Apollo's illegitimate children Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), Creed added an unexpected gravity to the consequences of the former's reckless lifestyle, mixing family tragedy into what was otherwise a traditional sports movie.<br/><br/>With Adonis now having dealt with his personal demons over his father's neglect and untimely death, Steven Caple Jr.'s follow-up Creed II faces its own battle in keeping the young fighter's story interesting, as well as delivering an exciting boxing movie without bowing down to cliches. Having lost the fight but won the night at the climax of the previous film, Adonis has gone on to win the Heavyweight Championship and achieve global stardom with trusted old dog Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) at his side. He proposes to his girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson), who is concerned that her own hearing loss may be passed down to their unborn child, and with few fighters talented enough to pose Adonis a real threat, he agonises over building a legacy worthy of his father and trainer. Ripples start to appear in his close relationships and personal drive, which only work against him when a figure from Rocky's past re-emerges with a challenge that could not only lose Creed the title, but end his career entirely.<br/><br/>That man is Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), who over the years has worked tirelessly to mould his son Viktor (Florian Munteanu) into one of the most most formidable bruisers on the planet. The film begins with them exiled in Ukraine after the embarrassment of Ivan's defeat in Rocky IV, and their relationship is actually the film's most interesting aspect. Ivan hopes that by making his son the world champion his country will welcome him back, but their bond is fractured and strained as a result. It's a thread that should have been explored in more depth, since it's infinitely more interesting than Adonis awkwardly practising his proposal speech. But the melodrama is backed up with a lot of heart, and Stallone's Balboa is again the thread that ties it all together. Dealing with his own family issues on top of dreading the thought of watching another Creed die in his prime at the hands of a Drago, Stallone is magnificent, capable of delivering chills as his voice is heard for the first time off-camera. It's a step down from the electricity of Creed, but it was always going to be. For what is essentially a remake of Rocky IV, the fact that Creed II manages to be emotional, exciting and joyous despite embracing genre cliches is a monumental achievement in itself."

They're all great. Now as of right now I still can't decide which film was better. The characters get the development needed and the fights are more intense than ever. Seriously Viktor Drago is an intense, menacing force in every fight. Bringing Adonis to his breaking point. His worst condition. They don't hold back. I thought this was the perfect next direction, connecting the old films to the new, without feeling really forced. The end of this also calls back to the history of Rocky which I won't state here. With all the brutality this film brings, it brings just as much emotion. I was getting sad during it not even an hour in, and I'm sure you will too. Basically all I have left to say is the character of Adonis Creed is spectacular and I can't wait to see where he goes next."

","Creed II is a very exacting sequel, and it's better compering with first film this is a lot more and much more excited i loved how they brought back everything still keeps it original with everything Creed II keeps up a lot of legacy's and this franchise to retired rocky to creed it keeps up their legacy. Dolph Lundgren is back as Ivan Drago in big screen and he has comeback to big screen before like Expendables franchise and comeback in films as cameos and TV shows. mostly he has been doing direct to DVD movies for awhile and comeback to this franchise as Ivan Drago with son character victor drago witch i think he is a better villain then to first creed ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan real boxer champion Tony Bellew, i don't care if he is a real boxer or not but i care about character this victor drago is a big tough machine but much scarier then to Ivan Drago. (Florian Munteanu) play's victor drago did a great job on his character he didn't say much not much of dialog he has like lundgren character when he say's if he dies he dies or i must break you. story follows three years after his loss to ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan from first Creed (2015), Adonis Creed (Michael B Jordan) scores a string of victories, culminating in a victory over Danny ""Stuntman"" Wheeler (Andre Ward) to win the WBC World Heavyweight Championship. Danny Stuntman is in first Creed when he punched creed in first film and creed made a deal whoever wins takes his mustang well in this film he got his mustang back after 3 years he lost it, someone else got it now it's his feels like it's john wick car in the first john wick Russians stole his Mustang he doesn't get it back until in sequel in john wick 2 in opening he got his car back just like with this film funny feeling of this film when Adonis in first Creed he lost sparing match he made a bet if someone bets him and he does get knocked out then in sequel it's in actually boxing ring and guy Andre who has his mustang gave it back kinda same feeling of film. then after Adonis bet Andre in boxing match he got everything back to normal Now Adonis is a worldwide star, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor, who agrees to marry him
but When Bianca suggests starting a new life together in Los Angeles, Adonis is reluctant to leave his life behind in Philadelphia. Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad) now after there's a new fighter who is built and tougher and born scarier fighter young fresh meat it's Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu) now he has not been in many movies he is in movie called Bogat (2016) now he got in a bigger role in this film. Meanwhile, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) in a former Soviet boxer who killed Adonis's father, Apollo Creed, in the ring thirty-three years earlier, sees an opportunity to regain the glory that was taken from him as a result of his loss to Rocky Balboa in Moscow later that same year by pitting<br/><br/>his son, Viktor Drago the Russian outcasts seeking redemption for the failures of Ivan Drago. Everyone has a purpose in this film, and everyone has a place in moving the narrative forward: avenging the actions of Rocky IV. people lost respect for Ivan Drago, he lost power, his wife kicked him out and son i don't know what reason, and scene with Rocky and Ivan where Ivan was in rocky restaurant at Adrian's Restaurant it looked intense way how Ivan looked at him looked full of rage anger to Rocky, Rocky was like what is he doing here ? it looked like you wanna watch entire scene great performance by Stallone and lundgren in that scene of movie it looked intense feels intense as well when you watch scene you can't never take your eyes of screen. and the way how this sequel is been made it's very It's so very deeply moving. Tears streamed my face during certain deeply meaningful scenes in this film. it's about winning but not really about winning and losing, either. It's about familial love, especially the love of fathers and sons, estrangement, loss, forgiveness, redemption, and reconciliation in film, The movie does very well of showing the other side of Drago. How life was for him after he lost to rocky balboa. Drago trying to undo his wrongs by living through his son. and creed is highly motivated as well in training, and redemption to take his revenge, this is remixing with Rocky IV continues with Creed II but this story should have maybe been in a first creed film, now this must have been tough for this franchise to go on sometimes but it doesn't feel like it needs a sequel or not people say would it be clubber Lang son or Tommy gun son ? who knows its hard for Sylvester Stallone for him now to think about this franchise to know how it will continue for him or directors and writers for him to know how would they make all creed films in a trilogy. in this film it there is a lot of comebacks a lot of it more then first Creed film because in first one their was comeback like for explame the footage from old Rocky movies or story takes place after all rocky films and last Rocky Balboa movie, continues to Creed now it's continuing to Creed II. who know's maybe this is end of franchise or it will continue it who knows really ? but this film was a great comeback and remixing Rocky IV all together bringing back Dolph Lundgren in big screen again as Ivan Drago. 10.10 it was great experience in theater don't miss out, don't wait until it comes out blu ray go pay ticket now and see it go it's a great film believe me you don't wanna miss this film in big screen you only live once in your life."

","Creed, with its inventive direction, pitch perfect performances and thoughtful screenplay, reset the Rocky franchise and made it worth following again. Creed II isn't quite that strong-notably the direction isn't as refreshing to see-but it is a great sequel and a stronger follow-up then any of the prior Rockys. For my money it is the 3rd best film in the franchise (Rocky, Creed, Creed II). Best of all I think the film really, really helps Rocky IV become a deeper, less silly film given the depth the Drago family is given in this film.<br/><br/>The screenplay follows the conventions of these stories and while nothing big surprises you the film is quite surprising in its details. So yes Don fights Viktor, but who would have guessed a Drago would be such a mother's boy? The film is at its best when it dealing with frayed family relationships. And to see how they get repaired or not. I adore the direction this film went in its story.<br/><br/>Jordan and Stallone give pitch perfect performances again. But I found Lundgren to be the most surprising. He gives a solid and nuanced performance that really complicates our feelings for Drago. Munteanu isn't given a lot of words but he is given a major irony and tension to play. He manages to be very raw, emotive and gives a solid performance. I don't know how much of acting career he can have but he was really good in this part. Credit goes to the director and casting agent as well on that point.<br/><br/>This was a great sequel. It might be the best 8th film in a franchise but I now want a Drago movie in addition to a Creed 3."
"cardsrock","8","1","3","27 November 2018"," The best sequel in the franchise
","A stunning sequel to one of the best films of 2015. Michael B. Jordan is given more of the spotlight, while Sly fades into even more of a supporting role. Jordan is simply fantastic and brings such raw emotion to lift this eighth film in the franchise to nearly the peak of the first Creed movie. The Rocky formula is pretty refined by this point, but man does it still pack a punch. Even with how much fighting is in the film, there are still so many great character moments that really elevate this sequel. One of the most surprising aspects for me is how sympathetic the Dragos ended up being. This was a great experience and if more sequels can hit like this, I'm all for continuing this storied saga."
"kingsgrl2010","8","1","3","26 November 2018"," A Fantastic Continuation...
","I didn't realize how much I missed the chemistry of Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, and Sylvester Stallone until I saw this movie last night. Usually sequels to a beloved film don't end up doing well, granted this is very far along in the Rocky Universe, but only the second in the Creed franchise. Callbacks to the earlier Rocky movies (not just the 4th) are so well done, and will probably make you want to rewatch the whole franchise just to make sure you caught everything. Adonis' journey in this film is one of finding what he is boxing for, what means the most to him, and if the effort is really worth it. His rival Viktor Drago wasn't just a villain. They actually gave him and his father Ivan Drago, real depth and reason. The director Steven Caple Jr. had a very hard task of trying to do a movie after Ryan Coogler. Coogler made a masterpiece, and Caple picked up these characters and continued the journey so well it felt like it was more of the same movie. From the feel, the music choices, the camera shots, and the storyline. You feel very much connected to these characters as you did in the first one, and even might shed a tear at the end."

Now here comes Creed II, which pits the son of the late Apollo Creed (Michael Jordan, not the basketball player, but the star of Chronicle as well as the bad guy from Black Panther, KIllmonger) against the son of still alive Ivan Drago (played by an unknown) in a fight to the finish. Between the two main fights, Creed must deal with the impending retirement of Rocky Balboa (Sly Stallone) as well as his girlfriend and soon to be bride's new child, who will soon grow up to be like Adonis. Even though it's rated PG-13, there are some tense moments that might be too scary for even the youngest rocky fan. The soundtrack and pacing is killer, and the script is uplifting yet emotional. I can't wait for Creed III in two years..."

","As a fan of the original series my whole life, the first Creed movie blew my mind and opened up so many possibilities of where the stories would go and what could happen later...<br/><br/>Then the news came: Creed Jr. would fight Drago Jr.
I've had the story in my head for almost two year by just imagining what could place. Then this weekend came and I sat in the theater. I don't think I stopped smiling except to cry the few times I was supposed to. The movie may spoon feed fans during certain points but you do not mind because of the performances. EVERYONE is fantastic in this movie. Michael B Jordan is better than before, Sly deserves another Oscar nod. Those are the givens. The Drago's however...<br/><br/>REMARKABLE. Dolph Lungren back as Ivan and newcomer Florian Munteanu as his son Viktor stoke the show. I will never be able to watch Rocky IV now without seeing a different Ivan Drago now. Dolph plays him now as a flawed, emotional individual and for good reasons. Florian's performance reminds me very much of a Tom Hardy type character. Very few words and all In the eyes. I hope he knows how great a job he did in a dramatic role and doesn't resort to type casting. He can FLAT OUT ACT.<br/><br/>I'm so proud of this movie. I'm so proud to be a fan."

"mram16","7","1","3","25 November 2018"," Decent entry into the Rocky film canon
","The film opens with Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) winning a title bout and becoming the heavyweight champion. In contrast to Adonis's life as a wealthy, celebrated champion, in Ukraine father and son Ivan and Viktor Drago live in poverty as the younger Drago tries to make a name for himself beating other fighters in the ring. Both father and son are bitter over their family's lost glory, and the abandonment of both by Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen), Ivan's former wife and Vicktor's mother.<br/><br/>After the successful championship fight, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson), who has been perusing a music career despite auditory problems which require her to wear hearing aids. Adonis Creed is a man on top of the world, but things change when a promoter holds a televised news conference in which the newly-minted champ is challenged to fight Viktor Drago. It was Viktor's father, Ivan, who killed Adonis's father during a fight three decades previously before being defeated himself in a grudge match with Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), who is now Adonis's trainer.<br/><br/>Though it seems that none of the people in his life want Adonis to agree to the match, he decides to do it anyway, a decision that leads to a falling out between him and Rocky, who remembers all too well the dangers of battling a Drago, not only from his own bout with Ivan, but also from watching his friend Apollo Creed die in the ring. This parting of the ways is painful for both men: Rocky has become the stand-in for the father whom Adonis never knew, while Adonis has become a surrogate son for the older man, whose relationship with his own son has deteriorated.<br/><br/>Adonis and Bianca move to the West Coast, where he starts training under Tony ""Little Duke"" Burton (Wood Harris), whose father once trained the legendary Apollo Creed. As Adonis prepares for the match he learns that Bianca is pregnant with their first child.<br/><br/>In the first match-up between Adonis and Viktor, Adonis is outmatched by the pure power of his opponent, and while he retains his title due to Viktor's actions leading to a disqualification, Adonis is broken in both body and spirit, and everyone know that he truly lost the match.<br/><br/>Rocky visits Adonis; though their relationship has been strained they patch things up, and after he's had time to heal both Rocky and Burton train Adonis harder than ever before to prepare him for a rematch against Viktor. In the meantime Bianca gives birth to their child, a daughter, who they fear may be afflicted by the same hearing problems as her mother.<br/><br/>Back in their home country, both Ivan and Viktor are now feted by the same people who spurned their family after Ivan's loss to Rocky all those years ago. Though Viktor isn't crazy about these people who showed his family no respect when they were down, Ivan seems to crave their approval, and wants his son to bring home the championship belt.<br/><br/>Finally we get the rematch, in which two men for whom failure is not an option square off, both putting everything they have into the fight.<br/><br/>While the film is not as strong as it's predecessor, it's a good movie and steers clear of of much of the cheesiness that plagued some of the sequels to the original Rocky movie."
"ajwbaseball","7","1","3","25 November 2018"," Rocky 3 with stakes
","While corny in parts, Creed 2 delivers a compelling narrative, some great characters, montages, fights, and for the first time in Rocky history- a sympathetic villain in Victor Drago. If you love rocky, you'll love this, and if you at least like creed, you'll appreciate this."
"rockman182","7","1","3","25 November 2018"," Creed II (2018)
","Like any other film fanatic, I have seen all the Rocky films. The films are formulaic and predictable yes, but they are good fun with enough heart to keep the series going. I did like Ryan Coogler's Creed, though not as much as many others. Still, it showed a fresh new take on the Rocky series and worked through a series of good performances and continuing the legacy of Apollo Creed through his son. I wasn't sure about a sequel without Coogler behind the camera but honestly I don't think Creed II skips a beat. its predictable and goes the route of Rocky IV but still fun to watch.<br/><br/>The film is about the son of Ivan Drago, Viktor and his rise in the boxing scene. he makes a wave and challenges Adonis Creed for the title. Creed has a lot going on, including a baby on the way and a falling out with his coach over the fight, Rocky Balboa. Still, Creed faces off against his toughest challenge yet in Drago, a merciless fighter who looks to hurt his opponents and ultimately avenge the loss to Rocky that his father endured over 30 years ago.<br/><br/>Without any surprise, the actual boxing fight scenes are terrific. People watching in the cinema felt every blow that Creed endures and throws. The film has a long running length which focuses on Creed's rehab and trying to get things with his family and friends right which may bother some and be formulaic but I think its done with taste and still manages to pack a punch with its heart. Michael B. Jordan is clearly one of the biggest stars going today and he doesn't miss a beat in this sequel.<br/><br/>The film feels like a sequel and just feels like it has lower stakes then the first but entertains in the fight portions which is enough to make it a good film. I'd measure it quite closely with the first Creed and think it will be as profitable. Not that mad that this series is spawning off the Rocky series because so far it is working. Just don't go the route of Rocky V and we will be good.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","For the longest time I've been on the record saying that Rocky II was my favorite from the Rocky/Creed franchise, but after seeing this movie I might just have to put it a notch below Creed II. It was that good for me, and it's surprising because I was never the biggest fan of the first Creed. But, no it well exceeded my expectations. Everything to me is done far better in comparisons to the first Creed.<br/><br/>Most notably the villain. One of the reasons I look down so much on the first Creed was I thought Creed's opponent as a character was boring and by far the weakest of the franchise. So when I saw the trailer for Creed II and I saw that Ivan Drago's son was gonna be this movies antagonist I was excited. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed. Sure maybe he doesn't rank as high as some of Rocky's antagonists, but again in comparison to the first Creed he is far better. And just like Rocky in Rocky IV I didn't think he could win the fight or even stand toe-to-toe with Drago even though it's a movie and you know he will.<br/><br/>And I think that's just a testament to how good the fight scenes actually sound. When your watching you almost think your getting hit. As for the soundtrack in this movie again I say it's better than the first. A lot of the songs they picked just bang and depending where placed, for instance the training sequence really got me behind Adonis. Finally the last thing I'll say is I really loved the small things this movie did like bring back the characters of Rocky's son and Ivan Drago's wife now ex-wife played by their respective actors/actresses.<br/><br/>All this and more made for a very worthy addition to the Rocky franchise and as much as I'd love to see these characters some more. Maybe it's better off we end here unless they can come up with something fresh but I don't see it. Nonetheless you got my money."

","I liked the movie, it was good, but it wasn't as intriguing until the end"
"un1","6","1","4","23 November 2018"," Decent
","Actually good-ish. In short: Good character development for Adonis, his girlfriend/wife and Rocky, decent main plot but the good training montages of the Rocky movies were like a character in themselves, in this movie the training montage isn't good enough for me, also the scrip lacks a proper villain backstory - both of which aren't overwhelming things to achieve since they were done properly before.<br/><br/>I didn't go in with high expectations so the movie was actually a lot better than I expected - I was expecting something akin to the Disney Star War movies or something made purely for commercial gain, it wasn't. The plot develops Adonis' story and character a lot but it lacked a developed ""villain"", unfortunately we didn't really get much of Viktor Drago, his motivation and his ambitions other than his dad, Ivan Drago, pushing him from behind and very few moments of his mother. I didn't like the training montage either, I feel like the movie didn't know if it wanted to be a classic Rocky movie or not. There was drama regarding Adonis' family but in the end it's not resolved in any way (it doesn't even seem to affect Adonis after Rocky simply told him a few words). Viktor Drago was played well for what the script allowed the actor to do but If the movie was 30 minutes shorter or if those 30 minutes were spent on developing Adonis' rival then it could have possibly be a movie of the year. Good effort."

"jakebirkel","8","1","5","16 March 2019"," As good as Creed? No. But definitely surpasses most of the Rocky movies.
","Creed II is undeniably formulaic, sticking to the formula established by Rocky movies of the past and sequels in general. While it's not as good as Creed, it's better than almost every Rocky with the exception of the original.<br/><br/>Steven Caple Jr. delivers something poetic and while there is no particularly memorable fight scene, he does use a particular visual style to emphasize drama, suspense, and other varying emotions. Sylvester Stallone returns to his role as writer and this time, it pays off big time. While he does stick to some clear formulaic character arcs with the protagonists, the thing that makes his writing good is the way he handles the Dragos. Ivan and Viktor gain my sympathy and Stallone turns them into so much more than the cardboard cut villains we saw in Rocky IV. He writes Ivan Drago with this intense perfection that honestly left me wanting more. Well done on both writing and direction.<br/><br/>Stallone is great playing what he plays best: Rocky. Tessa Thompson shines as Bianca and the actor who played Viktor Drago did pretty good. Dolph Lundgren got a chance to show why he's an extremely underrated actor in his return to his infamous role as Ivan Drago. He really does kill it in every scene. And yet Michael B. Jordan still kills it more than all of them as Adonis Creed. Creed's raw intensity and hunger to continue upholding his family's legacy while creating his own is perfectly captured through MBJ's performance.<br/><br/>Creed II isn't as good as Creed, but it definitely surpasses many of the Rocky films thanks to confident direction, decent writing, and plethora of finely tuned performances.

I loved how Rocky always remained in his character from the first to end. He always had his handball in his pocket, his hat and great advise. The soundtracks by Bill Conti from the first movie, ""Going the Distance and First Date"" captured my heart.

"traveler_45","10","1","6","23 November 2018"," Does Not Disappoint
","From the very beginning to the very end, Creed II was action-packed and full of emotional punches. I cannot state strongly enough how versatile and wonderful of an actor Michael B. Jordan is. This guy can do it all; drama, comedy, romance, anger, rage etc...there is literally no role he cannot transform into and Creed II is no exception. Sylvester Stallone is back and perfection as always, as Rocky Balboa. Stallone plays Rocky's emotional ups and downs in a way that only someone who truly knows this character could. Tessa Thompson and Phylicia Rashad are fantastic in their roles as Bianca and Maryann, respectively. It was nice to see everything tied in so nicely together at the end of the movie. This movie is about so much more than boxing; it's about family, what's worth it and your motivation to do what you do. Loved seeing Dolph Lundgren back as Ivan Drago; we see a different side to Ivan in this movie..something a bit more human and not so much machine. There are two surprise return characters that I didn't see coming, but was delighted to! I don't want to spoil it, so you'll have to see for yourself.

","The legacy of Rocky is an epic one that has etched its way into the hearts of sports movie fanatics until the end of time. Despite their outdated cinema work, the movies hold such epic bouts of fist flying destruction, brazen masculinity, and surprisingly deep portrayal of sport vs. life. It has worked super well for years, and with Creed reviving the series with a new, modern edge that showed a boxing movie can still pack the punches. So a sequel to continue the new boxer's legacy has emerged to challenge the rest of the Thanksgiving line up in hopes to win the championship of best box office. Will it succeed? Robbie K here to fill you in as I review:<br/><br/>Movie: Creed II (2018)<br/><br/>Director:
Steven Caple Jr.
Writers:
Cheo Hodari Coker (story by), Ryan Coogler (characters)
Stars:
Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson<br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>The Character Development: Adonis Creed's journey was soul searching and inspiring in the first film, and the sequel follows that back in spades. This film is dedicated to the torture of balancing pride of your career while trying to balance the other aspects of life. Adonis goes through a lot of tough mental burdens, which helps stretch the limits of the character. Of course Rocky himself still is finding ways to expand his own dynamic, still finding lessons to teach and learn as he himself goes through the throngs with his indirect nephew. A Rocky films has always been about expanding the character and the traditions continues in the 8th installment.<br/><br/>The Music: You like rap, hip hop, and R&B, you've got yourself a soundtrack that captivates the essence of the film. It's edgy, aggressive beat mixes beautifully with the actions scenes, mirroring the fighting lion that is Adonis in his quest for reaching his goals. Be ready for some hard-hitting beats, with potential aggressive lyrics that can be offensive.<br/><br/>Expanded Villain: Most Rocky movies do a poor job of elaborating on the villainous boxer who wishes to stop our hero. In this film though, the villains get a small subplot that helps to give them more details and appreciation. Balancing this tale with the main story, crafts a much better investment in time when it comes to designing the rival boxer that I really liked, especially when even Ivan Drago contributes significantly to the tale.<br/><br/>The Rocky Feeling: Creed II continues the tradition of the boxing movies, by crafting a tale that is all about getting guys in the macho, masculine mode. Adonis' next tale brings the motivational force to full light, instilling the testosterone fueled training, hype, enticement, and whatever else you are looking for. Guys in my showing were hooting in delight, sometimes batting their hands together during the high adrenaline moments. As for the females, well plenty of shirtless scenes and chiseled bodies to get you swooning if you like that. Past these moments though, classic fans will enjoy the bonds of coach and trainee once again working together to face life gloves up and eyes sharp.
The Final Fight: We know the series is all about that final match, where contender and titan throw themselves into the ring in all their epic, sweaty glory. Creed II has the finale you wait for, filled with the high adrenaline special effects, sound editing, high energy shots magic that studios craft. As the bout progresses the raw emotion of both contenders is unleashed, in a manner worthy of the David Vs. Goliath status they were going for. It is an epic finish to all the buildup and lasts well enough to be worthy of inclusion.<br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>A Little Too Aggressive at Times: For me the in your face, high adrenaline moments were sometimes perfectly executed. Other times it was a little eye rolling and overdone. The in your face moments, and fast to action attitude was fine in the first one, but at points in the movie it was a little sadder to watch. This plot point was supposedly conquered in the first one, yet they decided to harp on it as a recycled device. Small dislike, but we go with it.<br/><br/>Some Unnecessary Subplots: Creed II has a lot of heart and emotion with it, working to integrate a lot of angles to take Adonis' life in to help shape the character. Some of these angles worked quite well for me, and a couple of them didn't. I won't say anything to minimize the spoilers, but there are a couple of tangents they took that didn't quite add to the movie as much as they wanted. I would have liked a few other subplots to get some more detail instead, but given the grand scheme of the movie it's not quite as noticeable.<br/><br/>Carbon Copy: A point that might make or break the movie depending on the audience Creed 2 loses points for originality. While I understand that the first one wasn't unique in terms of stories, Creed 2 really modeled its structure quite closely to one of the original Rocky movies, guess which one. As such, the new coat of paint is quite refreshing, but given how much it follows the original in terms of main plot, it's a little disappointing given the predictability of the movie that comes with it. Will you be disappointed? It really depends on how much you hate carbon copy plots.<br/><br/>
The Verdict:<br/><br/>Creed II delivers on the attitude the trailer promised long ago. By expanding upon the rivals, portraying more life components with career, and maintaining the feel of a Rocky Movie it's going to please many fans of the franchise. Yet, the film still suffers from a tad too much modern aggression, some plot devices that didn't quite need to be there, and a rehashed plot that will make or break the film. Overall though, I liked it and felt it fit very well in the universe and holding quality above a number of other installments. So if you are looking for the testosterone driven plot line for the weekend, check this film out in spades this weekend, maximizing your experience in the theater. Otherwise definitely get ready for this one when it comes out to the wide public.<br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Drama/Sport: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5"

"jimbo-53-186511","4","0","2","27 January 2020"," A lot of sappiness and melodrama, but not an awful lot else
","Following on from the events of the first film Adonis is now champion of the world. However, his elation is to be short-lived when he discovers that someone else is hungry for his title. Its turn out though that this man isn't just any boxer, but he happens to be the son of the man who killed his father in an exhibition match over 30 years. With a combination of pride and revenge, Adonis takes on Viktor, but like his father Viktor is big and powerful so Rocky once again turns trainer to help Adonis prepare both physically and mentally...<br/><br/>Creed 2 is basically a pastiche of Rocky 3 and Rocky 4 (although it's clearly got more in common with part 4). It starts off like 3 where over-confidence becomes the boxer's undoing and the trainer has to take the boxer through a brutal training regime. Of course there are more parallels with 4 in that team Creed are fighting for pride, but the difference between Rocky 4 and Creed 2 is that team Drago are also fighting for pride (Drago Snr had nothing to lose when he first came to America in Rocky 4, but he brought shame on his country after his defeat to Rocky so Drago Jnr is trying to set the record straight).<br/><br/>In fairness the idea of 2 sons duking it out (particularly given the circumstances that has brought them together) has potential, but sadly a lot of the time Creed 2 felt like a lot less than the sum of its parts. For a start, there is am awful lot of melodrama in this film, but the problem is that a lot of it never really seems to add much or feel all that important. We hear endless conversations between the Drago's about Ivan letting his country down and then blaming him for his mother leaving them etc... This would have been fine if it amounted to anything, but it seems to just be insipid dialogue that's merely used to fill the gaps between the training and the fighting. To be fair Ivan may have his flaws as a person and is by no means a perfect parent, but at least he stuck by his son.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film seems to lay with how it fills its running time; in the first film there was a bit of time spent developing Adonis as a character, but that's not needed here so what do the writers do?? Well after the first fight which happens at around the 45 minute mark (which predictably can only go one way or else there'd be nowhere for the film to go in the second half) the film then spends a good chunk of its time focusing on Adonis playing happy families with his new-born child. Admittedly this is a nice aspect of the film for let's say 10 minutes, but too much time is spent on, let's face it, not a particularly interesting aspect of the narrative. Training & boxing is what I came to see and I didn't get enough of either here to be honest.<br/><br/>As far as performances go then Michael B Jordan is OK here (he's not quite as brattish as he was in the first film, but I'm still struggling to warm to his character overall - he's still lacking a bit of charisma). Thompson is lovely and her chemistry with Jordan is pretty good. Stallone is a good presence and handles some of the emotional scenes surprisingly well. Aside from a couple of moments, Lundgren (despite being integral to the story) doesn't add very much -although he's far less robotic than he was in Rocky 4. Nielsen's cameo is silly and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Although the film traipses through several predictable narrative tropes there was one thing that happens towards the end of the film in the final match which I did not expect to happen..<br/><br/>Overall then Creed 2 has a bit too much sap and melodrama for my liking and whilst these things do not always make a film bad they do if they feel as though they exist merely as filler and with how little development each of the threads had here this can be the only reason for their existence. On the whole I found this film less entertaining than the first film and at times I did find it a tad boring."

"metztex","6","0","1","26 January 2020"," Recycled plot again but teachs all must have fear, no fear you get hurt
","Bottom line up front: Like other reviewers, I think was rooting more for Drago. Creed goes into the first fight with no fear and not concept of the consequences. Result, he was a serious danger to himself and anyone around him. He then is nearly overwhelmed and must fight his way out. If you liked the Rocky movies, you might like this one. I had a hard time with it.<br/><br/>I hope they don't make another one of these. I just don't see the point in a fighter who just ""wants"" to fight and does not seem to understand this is not the way to approach this sport. You have to have something else driving you. My take anyway.<br/><br/>The directing was good enough to take the characters in the direction they needed to go in order to for Creed to realize he has to have fear but have the courage to face the fear in the end and not be overwhelmed by it. The big difference in this film, Creed's fear is self inflicted as he rushed into the first fight that was unnecessary. No way around it.<br/><br/>The Drago family shows some bitter realities of the Russian life and culture but from what I have seen (I have actually been in Russia), it is not the ""common"" narrative. Ivan does what a father must and he did what Rocky couldn't do. Viktor was fighting from the same place Rocky was fighting from. While this may not have been the director's intention, this is exactly what it showed."

"generationofswine","1","0","1","24 December 2019"," An Honest Review
","I finally got around to this, and I think my issue with it is Adonis Creed.<br/><br/>I kind of passed it over in the first one, because, honestly, it was just nice to see another Rocky movie, and you did see Creed train and fight and struggle a bit.<br/><br/>What we have is a kid that grew up an orphan, but at a young age got adopted into a life of privilege, had a good job, and didn't have to struggle financially, until he kind of did when he wanted to become a full time boxer... and then the story takes off.<br/><br/>And that was all passable, because he didn't exactly win did he? It was a hard fought first movie and he still had to go through a pretty tough arch to get to where he was that was both interesting and compelling... so despite the relative flaws in Creed, it was an enjoyable enough film to watch and far better than most of the movies we've been getting lately.<br/><br/>By the time Creed II rolls around, however, Adonis Creed is just whiny. And that's really it, his character isn't really allowed to progress any further, he's not allowed to grow in any way.<br/><br/>The poster suggests that there was a hard fought and emotional battle that Adonis had to over come and made it through a better man that when he started. The raw emotion of the poster makes us believe that he faced something insurmountable and came out victorious through sheer will alone.<br/><br/>And, honestly, that is how the fight itself played out and I loved every minute of it. Both Michael B. Jordan and Florian Munteanu sold each and every blow and you could almost feel it as you sat back shoving your face with popcorn.<br/><br/>But in the end, Adonis was still the same whiny little brat he was at the start of the first Creed installment and we are two films in. He hasn't grown in any way, no personal faults were over come. He's not at all a changed person, so you're left with the feeling that you haven't grown with him, you haven't progressed any, and by the end of the film you are left wondering what the point of it all was."

","I like Rocky as much as anyone, but this movie shows that it's time to hang this series up.<br/><br/>I doubt this film could have been more cliche-ridden and predictable. Every overused piece of nonsense is here - the big comeback, talking to graves, the baby, the harsh tragedy, the doubt, the seemingly unstoppable opponent, the reconciliation, heck the movie still does that ""shaky camera"" thing that should never be used again.<br/><br/>The entire film is just so forced and by-the-numbers. At best, this is a cheesy TV-movie. There are even countless laughable lines that seem like they are there just so they can be used in internet memes.<br/><br/>Even the big battle in Russia seems so rushed and fake (well, CGI FX go a long way now, crowd and all), it has zero emotional impact. In fact, absolutely none of these actors in the film make you care about their characters because they simply cannot act, Michael B. Jordan right at the top of that list.<br/><br/>Everyone just sleepwalks through their roles, including Stallone, who frankly can barely be understood when he speaks anymore. But hey, put on the hat and bounce that ball.<br/><br/>The only reason whatsoever to even consider watching this is to see Dolph Lundgren return as Ivan Drago. Unfortunately, he isn't given much to do except keep saying quick soundbites like ""take him down"" to his son. Frankly, Drago's story was a sad one, and he's the only character I really gave a darn about in the entire film. It was also cool to see Brigitte Nielsen make an appearance.<br/><br/>So see this for Dolph Lundgren if for any reason because this film is a joke."

"mrinalmmehta","7","0","1","29 August 2019"," My Review!
","Creed 2 gives a punch better than its predecessor. This one has many real life based situations that blends in so nicely with a Boxing plot movie. When real-life based situations and/or true-life based story are shown, it (mostly) tends to slow the pace of the movie. But nevertheless, this is a heart touching movie and must be viewed only on the big screen. If you do miss it, do a Amazon Prime / Netflix etc. The boxing side of the movie is action-packed and lives upto the title of Rocky series. This flick has a direct connection to Rocky IV and it's connected well even-though the gap is approx. 33 years.<br/><br/>Michael B Jordan has come up real fast in his career and is unstoppable. He nails every movie / tv series he has acted in. He is one the stars to whom I say, ""the future of Hollywood seems secure"". Sylvester Stallone must be proud that he has Michael carrying on the mantle.<br/><br/>The contender debut in Hollywood is strong and I think he might have a few projects coming at him, soon.<br/><br/>Peace Out!"

","I must be honest in saying that I don't expect much from these boxing movies, they're not great philosophical expressions, but they're not supposed to be -and that's ok. It's entertaining, engaging, action packed, with an appropriate sprinkling of drama and emotion.
I appreciate that sustained storyline and characters, developing from the previous movie nicely (not unexpectedly in any way but again, that's ok because the point here is the boxing) In fact, it's all interwoven quite nicely in my opinion, adding to the motivations of the character and, without revealing spoilers, I thought his entrance song to the final fight was a nice touch.
I've seen some reviews against the movie building on the premise that Adonis' character development was lacking and that they wanted to support Victor instead, both of which I will agree with. However, I think the integrity of the antagonist rounded out the plot very well and actually improved the overall storyline. If he were just another rude, bad-guy written to be purposely unlikeable, the movie would be a complete cliche. I found myself very sympathetic towards both Drogo and his son. I wanted to scream at them to stop, that they had all their priorities wrong, that what they were doing was never going to work out for them. At the end, I kind of just wanted to give Victor a hug.
I admit, nothing about the movie is particularly original or surprising, but not every movie has to be. I think it does what it's supposed to do and for that I give it merit. The soundtrack was good and the shots atmospheric. I snorted at the repeated (and very dramatic) use of spotlight on the boxing ring for the final fight but lest we forget it is a core dramatic technique, and that movies are drama, it worked well."

The supporting cast were also great , esp sly Stallone as Rocky , there's so much wisdom he gives Creed that you feel like he's the grandfather you need. The story is about Ivan dragos son vs Creed's boy . When the first movie built on this idea , I thought it was really brilliant how they put a nod to the rocky universe. This time I felt it was more of a cashgrab idea to ripoff the rocky franchise nostalgics. But I was proven wrong with the final act in this movie. Even though this is a sports - drama , I felt the drama part overtook the sports part which despite being super slow was great ! . the training montage in this movie is like a music video but only with bad music. Once again the final act was just really amazing and the visuals were just on par with fine editing and fight choreography . It was like a fusion of warrior , south paw and rocky.

This time, it's Apollo's son Adonis (Jordan) taking on, you guessed it, Ivan's son. After losing to Balboa, Ivan Drago returned to Russia in disgrace, and now he wants his son to exact revenge on his behalf. No clue why Ivan couldn't have done so himself 20 years ago. The story arc is also fairly routine for the series, with Creed (now champ) fighting and losing and fighting and winning and usually winding up a bloody mess at the end, no matter the outcome. Sylvester Stallone is still excellent as Rocky, and Tessa Thompson, although no longer a revelation (thanks to her work in Creed and the Marvel movies), is still quite terrific.

","In terms of the franchise, this is I think ""Rocky 8"" or something like that, so I didn't come to it expecting it to be fresh and original. I expected it to produce good fights, with growing tension, and a big payoff - and for it to do enough around that with the drama to support my investment in the characters. Broadly, the film does this, but it doesn't do it well - only 'okay'.<br/><br/>In terms of the boxing scenes, I was surprised by how they didn't replicate the best of the franchise, and some felt surprisingly flat and lacking in build/tension. They are professionally done, and they have the elements they needed, but I didn't feel the drama or the rush of the conclusion like I have with previous films, and with some real fights. This feeling of it being a lesser copy of something better rings true in the rest of the film too; the training sequences, the personal dramas - they all feel very obvious and lacking a spark, much like a faded copy. In the drama the reference points of proposals, births, personal struggles etc are fairly generically written, but my biggest issue is that the writing squanders a lot of better stuff to give time to these elements. Specifically I mean the struggle of the Drago's as men, and as father/son; the anger, resentment, longing, and missed life in both of them is right there, and when we have time with them it is very well delivered - but far too little. Instead we get direct dialogue between characters, people talking to graves etc - material used before and nothing much added by it. I'm not suggesting the film branches out to explore the Russian characters, but certainly there was more to be had here.<br/><br/>For the rest, it all benefits from a strong cast. Stallone does his usual stuff to good effect, but Jordan makes way more of the material than is on the page. Thompson doesn't do as well but to be fair she is poorly served. I was impressed by Lundgren and Munteanu, in particular how much the latter did with so little. Okay they are not the most complex characters but with a lot of body language and face work they show years of pain and anger, the impact on them as people, and on them as father/son; like I said, I really wanted more on this. Behind the camera I wondered what had changed, and the lack of Coogler seems the most obvious; I did not know the name of director Caple Jnr, and there doesn't seem to be much on his resume to suggest that will change, or that he would have done anything with Creed II other than a workmanlike job.<br/><br/>The film produces enough of the cliché to provide some entertainment value there, but at the same time it does little more than this. The drama is soapy but at the same time much more interesting material is left to small touches, and the boxing action is professionally done, but doesn't have the drama and building tension of the best of the franchise."

","Review:
I've grown up watching the Rocky movies, and I always used to get excited when I heard that Sylvester Stallone was working on another one, but they went downhill after the 4th instalment. Now with the Creed movies taking over, the first movie was quite good, but this film just seemed like a ""Mish Mash"" version of the 4th movie, were Rocky went toe to toe with the gigantic Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), who was basically a laboratory experiment. In this movie, Creed (Michael B. Jordan) is out for revenge against Drago's son, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), who is quickly moving up the ranks, and seeking the heavyweight champion belts. After losing his dad in the ring during a fight against Ivan, Adonis (Creed) agrees to fight Viktor, but without the backing from Rocky, who thinks the fight is a bad idea. I did find the movie quite slow, from the beginning to the end, and the fighting scenes weren't as dramatic as the earlier Rocky movies. The whole concept was, more or less, exactly the same as Rocky 4, and the predictable storyline, which had some corny lines, did become a bit tedious after a while, but it's what's we have grown to expect from Rocky/Creed movies. Michael B. Jordan seems to act the same in all of his movies, so his performance wasn't that surprising, but once he had the baby, and he actually took the fight seriously, it was good to see an emotional character who became more technical with his fighting skills. I did realise a Father/Sons theme, which must have been hard for Sylvester Stallone after losing his son, Sage Stallone in 2012 at the young age of 36. Anyway, I didn't get that ""underdog coming good"" feeling after watching this movie, but it's watchable, once it eventually gets going. I would have liked to have seen some banter between Ivan and Rocky, and it would have been good to hear Viktor speak. As we live in a day and age of endless remakes, I doubt that another franchise is ever going to able to give you that amazing feeling that you get when you hear the Rocky theme again, and the fight choreography looks more staged than intense like the olden days, which is why this average movie didn't meet all expectations. On paper, the thought of Ivan and Apollo's sons coming face to face in the ring sounds like it's going to be a movie spectacular but it lacked the action and intensity that the original Ivan vs. Rocky fight did. A lot of time was wasted on Adonis's back story, which made complete sense in one way, but I personally just wanted to see the fight. With opponents like Apollo, Mr. T and Ivan Drago, Viktor certainly looked the perfect candidate but he wasn't that entertaining out of the ring. I just think that it's time for a new boxing franchise, with some flamboyant characters who will light up the screen. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Steven Caple Jr., who also brought you the Land in 2016. As this is his first major release, he wouldn't have been my first choice to direct a movie which could affect a whole franchise. He did a decent job, but he seemed to have followed the Rocky handbook, more than trying something fresh and new. One of the things that let this movie down, was the annoying backing track, which made the film feel cheap and a bit stale. With Rocky IV being the most successful movie in the Rocky franchise, taking in $127million, closely followed by Rocky III, which was my favourite, I'm not surprised that they chose this concept to carry on the Creed franchise. It would be good to see Mr. T talking trash again, but that's just wishful thinking. Anyway, Creed II definitely didn't have the impact that the early Rocky movies did, but it's still a decent boxing movie, which had some emotional moments.<br/><br/>Budget: $50million
Worldwide Gross: $214million<br/><br/>Genre: Drama, Sport

Pregnant, engages, champion and Drago's drama all at the same time!?!?! hummm... what a coincidence.

","I was curious to see how the story unfolds after a great start for the next gen by Creed. Unfortunately nothing much was achieved cinematically.
Basically a revenge story this one, probably expected , as creed started with the same premise. Creed started by the protagonist, son of creed, coming into boxing to get revenge for his father's death. Naturally drago had to come into his with his own son to have a match up. Less drama there. All the fights follow same pattern. Lose first and then come back stronger and beat the bad guy. Lovely to see Dolph lundgren after a longtime. In the fights His son looked menacing and hugely powerful. Somehow it's difficult to digest that he was made to lose. Also nothing spectacular was done by creed to achieve this feat.
In between the two fights, the movie meanders. No big dramatic thing happens. No intrigue. No special character builds up. Which was an important part of the first instalment.
The wife of Creed had less part and even less singing. The music also was only good in parts.
Well shot otherwise.
A sense of deja vú stays throughout. I didn't see the version with Dolph's Ukrainian/Russian dialogues translated, so didn't get what they were discussing with his supposedly ?wife? Amiss for me.
Overall a disappointment."

But as far as remakes go, it's not badly done and entertaining enough. It is however the kind of movie that really tells a franchise is at the end of the line and they should really stop making more at this point."

"Caleb_Everett","8","0","1","17 April 2019"," Great, but could have been so much more.
","Fantastic film, but it honestly left me wanting more.<br/><br/>First, I really DID NOT like the CGI elements they added to this film, I know they weren't crazy abundant, but it seemed like every chance they got in a fight they felt like they had to make the arena seem larger than life? I didn't fully understand that, I mean I know they didn't want to probably hire a bunch of extras for scenes...but what stopped them before? I mean it's apart of the Rocky universe.<br/><br/>Second, I don't necessarily understand the entire Drago saga? I understand that perhaps he would have had some backlash for losing to Rocky Balboa, but Rocky is arguably (probably) the greatest boxer in the history of the sport. Wouldn't, in time, the Russian government is accepting of the fact that their guy lost...I mean look at Rocky's resume.<br/><br/>Third, I think the film really missed the mark on the whole point of the story. Obviously, this whole film is about the redemption of Apollo, but wasn't Apollo not there for Adonis? Don't get me wrong, I don't want to smear the Creed name, I'm a huge Apollo fan. The story though could have explored the feelings of resentment that Adonis may hold towards his father. I mean, what if when Drago shows up and they bring up the Father aspect, what if Adonis would have been like, ""Screw him, he wasn't there for me"". They really could have explored that.<br/><br/>Then you have a Rocky swing in and talk about the importance of Father-son (yadda yadda yada). You have Adonis see the fault of his ways and agree to the fight. Ok, this is where things get tricky...you don't have them fight twice. Let's face it that whole, lose then redeem yourself, kind of became lame after Rocky III. You have them fight in just one fight, however during this fight, Adonis can see that Viktor is struggling to win, but he is doing it for his FATHER. Adonis then finishes the fight but acknowledges that in some weird way Viktor and he are the same on a bunch of levels.<br/><br/>OBVIOUSLY, my version of it has a lot of holes...don't pick it apart lol. I did enjoy this movie and I'll more than likely watch it again."

","A couple of reviewers say you root for Drago's kid in this one, and you sort of do root for them a bit, or at least, you understand their motivations. Their performances were great, and yeah, probably better than the heroes, but the heroes had terrible lines and a wobbly story arc. Creed's motivations are a bit more confusing, but Jordan reigns in the confusing script, comes across as relatable and makes this a fantastic film. Though I have to add, there is *NO WAY* Jordan is in Drago's son's weight class.<br/><br/>A lot of haters, but I loved this one, the script was a B-. Though really with a few tweaks could have been better, I am ashamed to admit as an avid movie fan I really loved the 80s style training montage(s). The movie manages to pull off a lot of emotional pull for those of us that used to like boxing before the modern era turned it all to trash.<br/><br/>The actors really did a great job, even Stallone, who made his career off of stealing the story of a guy who knocked down Mohammed Ali.<br/><br/>After watching this movie I figured out Jordan was the villain in Black Panther. Turns out he's better than the 'human torch', from whatever awful version of the fantastic 4 he was in, led us to believe. He's in my top 25 favorite actors now. They're even going to potentially have him play a young Morpheus in a Matrix prequel. I'm looking forward to it now.<br/><br/>If you liked the original Rocky movies, outside of the first Rocky, this is the third best one after Rocky and the original 'Creed'. I'd love to see Drago's character and his son make another appearance in a third version or a movie about just *their* characters and see Drago's son achieve some kind of success. They were really great and you actually see them as more three dimensional than most of people in Creed's corner."

However Creed II just pulled an underdogs knockout punch in the dying seconds of the 12th round. I know there is talk of a Creed III but I feel this movie just wrapped up 40 years of story telling.

","It's not a bad movie, the scenes are largely well shot (Outside of the ring), the acting is largely ok, the set, consume, lighting all ticks the right boxes. Where this goes wrong is the plot is very weak, and it is pointlessly weak.<br/><br/>Victor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago is fighting in warehouses in the Ukraine, spotted by a promoter, next thing he is in the US challenging the World Heavyweight Title holder (Adonis Creed).<br/><br/>So here is the rub, no back street warehouse fighter is ever going to get a shot at the world heavyweight title because he has no fight lineage. Victor would need to be on the rankings to get a title sanctioned shot, and yet he's fought no one that is a contender. This means the premise is pretty silly, as is the idea that some big warehouse fighter could actually KO a tier one boxer.<br/><br/>All they needed to do to fix this was show the rise of Victor through the rankings and establish some sort of fearsome KO trend that really built press support for the fight between him and Creed.<br/><br/>On the boxing side, Rocky seems to have one game plan in every fight - learn to take a lot of damage because the more damage you take the more impervious you become to it??? Yep that is like telling a tyre, the more worn down you get the more impervious to getting worn down you become. Oh, and lifting weights, getting bulked up, all that is critical in boxing, forget the fact that the worlds greatest boxers can slip and cover (Think Sugar Ray, Mayweather etc) so they are new impossible for meathead fighters to hit.<br/><br/>The strength of the Rocky franchise has always rested in the humanity of Rocky and his struggle with life and poverty, his desire to overcome his life challenges etc. Stallone has over stretched this in the past, the movies moved from the great breakout of Rocky 1 and 2 to the increasingly silly 4 and 5 and whatever the heck that come back in your 60's was called. Trading off the past success and building new chapters that lack the story integrity only serves to weaken the memory of the former films. But, i'm sure they made good at the box office.<br/><br/>Creed 2 is a movie that could've been much better, and it wouldn't have cost much if anything to fix the plot holes.<br/><br/>Creed 2 still suffers from unbelievable boxing scenes where a fighter is punched full in the face with huge shots and takes several of them shaking them off. Neither Creed not Drago look like good boxers in this movie, they look like meatheads throwing big shot combo's. There is no finesse, but hey it is a movie. However, because the backstory building to the fight is so weak, the belief in it undermines the out of the ring content about family life, rocky and him missing Adrian, the minor piece about the light not working - those more real to life elements are weakened by being attached to the silliness in the core premise.<br/><br/>The Creed movies are a nice attempt at extending the brand life of Rocky, although it really is time to call it a day now."

","Rocky films are based on simple formula. Underdog protagonist, his struggle, he prepares for a fight and the big fight. Here the main guy we are supposed to be rooting for is an emotionless guy who underestimates everyone. He even ignores Rocky's advice. On the other hand we have Viktor, a brute of a man who is son of Ivan Drago. He wants to earn respect for his father and follows his every advice. They face each other. We see how Viktor trains hard and struggles to make living after his father lost to Rocky. On the other hand Creed does a few simple training routines and shoots for interviews. Creed even pushed the old man Ivan on a slight verbal teasing. During the fight Drago walks over Creed, manages to break his ribs, Creed barely manages to save his title because of a disqualification. Next Rocky comes in, rematch moves to Russia. Rocky trains him in a rural facility. And our man Creed manages to beat Viktor witha broken freakin' Rib.
And if you think this came as predictable, wait until you see the filler scenes where characters are busy talking about everything. Training and actual fights have been sidelined. While in Rocky 4 I was rooting for Rocky and Apollo. Here I was rooting for Viktor Drago. Both Dragos came off as sympathetic underdogs. And Rocky series is all about underdog story. Here Creed has failed miserably. I would be happy to see a Drago spinoff, since this Creed is not going anywhere."

The premise for Creed 2 is solid and the previews looked great. So my wife and I were excited to watch the latest installment of this franchise. It started off well but after 45 minutes it lost it's steam.
First off Drago's son is almost twice the size of Adonis.There is no chance in hell this fight would happen in a legal ring because of their weight discrepancies.
The movie then dragged on after Donny's first fight and his trying to find a purpose for himself. The nonsensical toe-to-toe training in the desert was just ridiculous and cheesy. Followed by the walk on music with his wife singing in the background. Then the even more ridiculous fight where Donny found the inner strength to beat Drago's son. Even after the loss, Drago proclaimed his love for his son.<br/><br/>The worst part of this mess is that it tried so hard to make everyone happy and desperately tried to find story line for this movie. It ended up becoming an embarrassment. It ended off so ridiculously bad that I honestly felt bad for Sly.

"Magow-Intermean","9","0","1","22 March 2019"," Creed IIðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’¸Review
","Against the wishes of cornerman Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson), new heavyweight champion of the world, Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), faces Russian Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), the son of Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), the man who killed Adonis' father. Creed was that boxing ideal: a haymaker out of nowhere. Writer-director Ryan Coogler and star Michael B. Jordan took a practically moribund property and made it at once old-school and modern, deftly mixing full-blown romance with punishing pugilism, nuance and social awareness to stave off any potential triteness. Creed II, with Coogler only on executive producer duties, is sadly a lesser effort, full of programmatic plotting and on-the-bloodied-nose writing, but leavened by the chemistry of its stars and its commitment to the beats of the series. The jumping-off point for the sequel is not Rocky II but Rocky IV, aka 'The One Where Rocky Grows A Beard, Chops Wood And Wins Over Moscow'. By 1985, Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed had been relegated to Sacrificial Sidekick Status, and it's his death at the hands of Ivan Drago that provides the engine for the new film. Under the tutelage of Ivan (Lundgren), Viktor Drago's (Munteanu) rise as a contender for Adonis' (Jordan) newly won heavyweight crown throws the young fighter into turmoil, as shown by endless scenes of him debating (with Rocky, Bianca, his mother) whether he should take the fight to avenge his father. To further compound his confusion, Adonis and Bianca (Thompson) are about to become parents, and have to face the prospect that the baby might inherit deafness from Bianca. The first film leaned into its more melodramatic elements. Here director Steven Caple Jr almost feels embarrassed by them, never letting the fears of the prospective parents register. The big problem here is the writing. There's more speechifying this time (""Are you here to prove something to other people or prove something to yourself?"" barks Rocky (Stallone) at Apollo) and the exposition - often done through through TV punditry - lacks Coogler's economy and subtlety. While Creed made Adonis' life in Philadelphia authentic, Creed II doesn't bring telling specificity to Adonis' new world as a champ: it's just a tired litany of spacious apartments, lovemaking montages to R'n'B and interactions with the smallest entourage in boxing history. It's also a film that wears its subtext on its stars-and-stripes robe. ""It's Shakespearean!"" announces a ringside commentator, referring to the nexus of fathers, sons and tragedies in play. Creed II is Shakespearean minus the wit, profundity and emotional heft. On the other side of the pond, Ivan and Viktor are given a thread of a through-line about trying to work their way back into the graces of the Russian boxing establishment. Although it's nice to see Stallone and Lundgren share the same frame again, Ivan and Viktor remain ciphers. Viktor, in particular, is granted all the complexity of a Brosnan-era Bond henchman. Still there's pleasure to be had in spending time with these characters. Jordan and Stallone still retain their first film chemistry. Jordan and Thompson also still vibe, despite the latter being denied any inner life of her own. The film continues to find fun in all the Rocky staples. There are montages that cross-cut between Adonis and Viktor training - the former shadow boxing underwater, the latter doing impressive things with ropes - although sadly not to sub-rate synth music Ã  la 1985. And Caple Jr mounts impressive fight sequences, using slow mo sparingly and a great use of POV shots - the light of the doctor's torch will stay with you. And it's a hard heart that doesn't respond to the impossible-to-resist button pushing - that music - in the enjoyably OTT boxing finale."

"AICLucid1","9","0","2","13 March 2019"," This is a solid film.
","Creed II is a very solid film. It does feel like it peaks a little too early in a few places. Creed becomes the Champ in the first scene he's in and the first Drago fight comes in before the halfway point. The reasons are logical and they serve the story. You just have to trust the movie to be what it will be. It also feels like Stallone is passing the torch of the series to Creed this time. Stallone recently stated that he's retiring the Rocky character. The fight scenes are very well choreographed. The performances are very good, especially Michael B. Jordan, who I'm looking forward to seeing how his career progresses. There's great shots of the city of Philadelphia and the music is its own with the classic Rocky feel in the right places.<br/><br/>You have to believe in yourself. This is a constant theme in every Rocky movie but this is more evident in this film than all the others. Adonis Creed has everything going for him in the beginning. He has fully recovered from the loss in the last film and becomes the champion of the world and now can start his own legacy. Creed is at his highest level of confidence and all is going is way. He's starting his legacy in the ring and is about to start his own family outside of the ring. This doesn't get tested until the first fight with Drago. He is beaten severely and only retains his title due to a disqualification. Creed was hellbent on avenging his father's legacy that he focused on everything but himself. It isn't until he becomes a father that he starts to believe in himself again because he has to for the sake of his family.<br/><br/>An interesting point is that, unlike the last couple of Rocky films where there isn't a villian like character, the Dragos represent hate, spite and malignant narcissism. Especially with Ludmilla Drago (A cameo by Brigitte Nielsen interestingly enough) abandoning her son Viktor when it's clear he is about to lose the fight. Ivan Drago does gain a little humanity back by throwing in the towel to save his son from further injury. Despite his bitterness, through it all, he loves his son. I only wonder how Stallone, as the main screenwriter, was going to handle the bond between Rocky and Robert in light of his own son's passing. It's a bittersweet scene and those tears at the end may have been as much about Sage as serving the scene. You never know in Hollywood, but Rocky going inside his son's home to be a part of a family again is a good way to end the Rocky story arc as he is not alone anymore.<br/><br/>This film is also a testament of the bond between parent and child. Adonis Creed becoming a father becomes his driving force to get back to believing in himself again after the disastrous beating he took from Viktor Drago in the first fight. Distance and death do not ultimately separate this bond, for better or worse. Even Ivan Drago, who was hellbent to repair the legacy he lost and was nasty in his attempt to do so, put all that aside as his son was suffering a defeat and abandonment from his mother, who narcissistically left her son. Rocky was distant from his son for a long time but he shows up on his doorstep in the end and Robert lets Rocky back in. It's never really known what was the catalyst for their distance because it doesn't matter. The bond is never broken."

","I rated this with 10 stars only because although the disappointment of this sequel I really want the franchise to continue, hopefully in a more inspiring way.
The first Creed was not as good as any of the Rocky's but was still good, because it managed to transfer some of the original Rocky energy. But even though this new Creed was though as I revival of Rocky IV, it didn't reached it's potential. It was to fast, predictable, and for me Michael B. Jordan is not up for the challenge.
Also I don't get it why they didn't used more of the old Rocky movies sound track, in my opinion that would have helped a lot bringing to old Rocky atmosphere."

"chasemykleby","7","0","1","9 March 2019"," A solid sequel that will hold up years to come.
","""Creed 2"" Review
(7/10)<br/><br/>This is by no means a Rocky Saga classic, but it is a solid sequel that will hold up years to come.
Ryan Coogler did a fantastic job with the first Creed, probably my favorite Rocky/Creed movie ever, but he did not return for the sequel which left me a little worried going into this film. And while the followup isn't a runaway success in the way that Coogler's installment was, it's still an effective boxing drama which brings greater depth to the Rocky sequels that inspired it.
Caple does an equally commendable job behind the camera on Creed II, even though his directorial approach lacks the impressive technical flourishes (like the single-take boxing sequences) that Coogler brought to the table on the first Creed. And sometimes it feels as though he's trying to do his best impersonation of Coogler on some of his shots. The soundtrack isn't as great as the first one, but solid nonetheless.
Much like their protagonist, the Creed movies continue to carve out a legacy for themselves, yet always keep one foot in the past and continue to honor the traditions of the past. Stallone delivers another moving performance as the older, wiser, and more regretful Rocky in Creed II, this storyline has as much to do with Rocky as it does with Creed. The biggest surprise in Creed II is how the sequel takes the Ivan Drago character - who was a pretty cartoonish villain and stand-in for the Soviet Union in Rocky IV - and transforms him into a genuinely tragic figure whose shattered ego and broken spirit have poisoned his relationship with his son, Viktor.
All in all, Creed II does a very good job of building upon the first Creed's story and themes in a satisfying fashion, while advancing the overarching narrative of the Rocky and Creed movies at the same time. It's not as inventive or groundbreaking as Coogler's film before it, but that's more of a testament to the high bar that Creed set than any failure on the sequel's part. Those who were fans of the original Creed should largely enjoy its followup and may even appreciate how it casts one of the sillier Rocky sequels in a more serious and tragic light."

"itsbobr","9","0","1","7 March 2019"," Very Good Fight Story
","Reluctantly, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) agrees to manage the new Heavyweight Champion of the World Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) - and he is often referred to as Donny - to go against Russian boxer Victor Drago (Florian Munteanu) whose father Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) killed Adonis' father Apollo in the ring.<br/><br/>I have always said that there are 2-thingns that we can always count on most of the time: A fight movie and a movie about a child who goes to Heaven and comes back and tells what was experienced there. Here we go.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an Adonis' fight when he becomes Champion of the World, then a soap opera scenario between Adonis and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) who will become Adonis's wife. Next we see a fight between Adonis and Victor Drago when Adonis wins by Victor being disqualified for an illegal hit and all this is without Rocky in Adonis' corner.<br/><br/>Then later Rocky becomes Adonis' trainer to again fight Victor and teaches Adonis to train differently along with some boxing techniques not previously used by Adonis.<br/><br/>Notables: Brigitte Nielsen as Victor Drago's mother; Phylicia Rashad as Adonis' mother. Wood Harris as Tony, Adonis' manager against the first fight with Victor Drago and he is also he one to let Adonis know Victor wants a rematch, but in Russia.<br/><br/>So we have a very good fight story that includes a little bit of a Soap, concerns over the hearing of Adonis' baby, determination, commitment, loyalty and doing the right thing for the right reason.<br/><br/>The fight at the end l gets us twisting, and dodging blows on the couch we are on. The fight looked too real. I don't know how they do it but the body blows really look too real to just be movie magic. (But that is what it is.<br/><br/>I did notice that when anyone greeted Rocky, they never used the term ""champ"" but instead Rocky or Mr. Balboa. I mean he was a champion of the world at one time and usually ""Champ"" is used. Quite strange.<br/><br/>The ending was very good, but I would liked to have seen that street light in front of Rocky's house in Philly finally light up after Rocky's complaint that it hasn't worked for years, but that is just me. Then again Rocky finally gets up the courage to visit his estranged son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) who now has a son Logan (Robbie Johns). I mention all this because you will see all again in another sequel to the Rocky Balboa story. Pretty sure.<br/><br/>Yes, there will be sequels, but right now we are waiting for that child to go to Heaven and come back and tell us what was experienced there. Can't wait.

"Dragonsouls","6","0","1","7 March 2019"," A dispassionate production of 2 stories in one film
","Creed 2 is a story split in half. One half is a story about love, sacrifice and family life in the modern world, where husband and wife are often taken with career and are unable to raise children. I loved this part of the movie, the relationship subplot between Adonis and Bianca was well written and both Tessa Thompson and Michael Jordan performed best when they were together on screen.<br/><br/>The 2nd half of the story is the boxing part, which was terrible. It was written poorly, acted poorly, especially by Stallone. I though Sylvester Stallone was an absolute piece of iron in this film, no pun intended. Just like Ivan Drago called him in Rocky 4, Stallone was as stiff and as wooden as ever. His acting was just flat out lethargic and bad.<br/><br/>It was so predicatable....and in a sense, it was a remake of Rocky 4 and Rocky 3 mixed together. One of the most unoriginal Rocky movies ever. A complete cash cow in every sense of the word. I was hoping for some remorse from Drago, perhaps a showing of respect between him and Rocky, but there was none of that. The scene between Rocky and Ivan in the restaurant was cringe worthy.<br/><br/>Michael B Jordan is a pretty good actor and overall, he was excellent in this. He stole every scene. I loved Tessa but she lacked energy during the fight scenes. She hardly seemed scared for her husband as he took a beating.<br/><br/>I can't give this film more than a 6. I admit, I was never bored during watching despite the horrible writing. There were some good, human, heartfelt moments, including at the end. I doubt I would watch this film again though, unlike Rocky 4, which was a film I've seen over a dozen times."

","How this gets 7.4 here on IMDB and 84% on Rotten Tomatoes is beyond me. It was an averagely entertaining film but deeply flawed. Maybe i was just in a bad mood because reading some of the negative reviews here none of them point out the problems i had with the film. Basically Creed II tried on one one hand be a very cliched cheesy film but also seemed to think it was a classy, craft-film at the same time. It follows and does many of the same cheesy things Rocky IV did but at the same time pulls back on the musical cues that tell us how to feel and almost mutes the audience reactions during the fights so that everything is subdued. Now Rocky IV is a classic of fun cheese and if you're going down that road then that's how you do it, you can't have your cake and eat it like Creed II tries. The fight shots in the ring were all so obviously filmed in front of a green screen and terribly composited into the crowd backgrounds that it constantly drew me out of the illusion and i don't understand why no one else has mentioned this. As i mentioned before, there's a complete lack of audience reaction and atmosphere during the fights and stirring musical cues were non-existent despite every punch thrown being a silly overblown haymaker that the fighters just shook off. Nothing worked well for me at all, there was no excitement!
I quite liked the quieter moments, that's the true heart of a film like this but as many have stated, Creed just comes off as whiny and weak."

","Okay Trailer was spot on but after seeing this movie i feel like it was nothing special.
I am a Huge Fan of Rocky Franchise although after 3rd installment Rocky Franchise was somehow washed out because of the story plot and weak emotion but Rocky Series is Famous for Memorable acting Whether it is From Pauli e,Mickey,Adrian or even from Rocky. But this movie had no emotion at all and Thoroughly predictable,Nothing Intense as it should be in Boxing Movie,He Didn't even knew his father there was no need for him to fight and the thing in the last scene fighting for himself was totally mediocre, No character Development in the end You will Feel The Emotion For Antagonist rather than Protagonist and feel sorry for him,The Story is 15 minutes of Boxing and rest of the time Family gossip and Adonis Fighting His Demons. At Least i was Hoping For Something Intense Between Creed and Dr ago sons but what we get is Adonis Fighting And His Wife Singing .Maybe Plot would have been better if Rocky would Have Died and Fighting with Emotion But This one is too much and Boxing Scenes were-not that much Realistic go and Learn From Million Dollar Baby.

We see characters from Rocky IV returning, Dolph Lundgren and Brigitte Nielsen who has aged badly.<br/><br/>The film is more of an emotional drama film than an action-packed feature. I found the training and boxing choreography very substandard. Cinematography is excellent - the director of photography Kramer Morgenthau did his job well. Also music in the film is well handled by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. All the actors play their part but the main actors are ill used. Dolph Lundgren and Bridgette Neilsen are not given enough screen time. Also I don't like the actor they chose to be the son of Drago - he looks nothing like him.<br/><br/>The script is the dullest part. This is a two hour film and one you would never see twice.

","Creed 2 is an amazing movie about boxing and about family, although it gets pretty predictible at some points in the movie. It still is a lot of fun to watch. Especially if you like sports. The music is great, camera work is fantastic (just like the first movie) and, although Donny Creed is not a really interesting main character, you are really going to like him and his family during this movie.
The music in this movie is great. The music during the train scene is great. While Donny is training, you hear an amazing soundtrack. Also during the last fight scene you here: ""Gonna fly now"" just like in the old Rocky movies. This gives you a lot of motivation and after this movie I really wanted to go to the gym and train like Donny.
The way the fight and train scenes are filmed. Is truly amazing. You'll ask yourself: ""how did they shoot that"" multiple times, because the camera gets really close and is spinning and gives you the feeling that you are the referee during the fight. You are actually feeling the hits Donny gets because of the great camera work.
Although Donny is not a very interesting character. You are still going to like him and his family. You can see that he only cares about his mom, girlfriend and his trainer Rocky. That is what i like about him. And when he wins the final fight. I was so happy for him and his family.
Creed 2 is a great film and if you like movies about family and sports, not just boxing but any sport, then I highly recommend watching this because you will not be dissapointed."

He's there, but I feel like they are slowly switching the focus more and more to the Creed family/characters which is a good thing IMO.<br/><br/>And finally, the most remarkable thing for me was that they've actually given some depth into Ivan Drago and his fighter characters. That caught me completely off guard. Just watch it and you'll understand too!"

","The Rocky movies have created some great cinema about life. Rocky I, II, Balboa and Creed I all succeeded in making deeply-human portrayals of real and relatable people.
Creed II did it again. This time the boxing, even though probably best executed and filmed ever in a Rocky movie, isn't even all that important. Make no mistake, the big training scenes are in line with the classics and you feel the bodyshots landing, but suprisingly it's just the background of the story.
The real punch of the film lies in it's showing of what life is all about. Doing your best, loving and caring and be there for your family. With a special emphasis on fatherhood. In a very subtile and non-preachy way. A feat in these SWJ-times.
The relationships between Rocky and Adonis, between Adonis and his daughter and between the Drago's are all key in this movie and carry the emotional weight of the film. In a classy way it's a conservative tribute to family love.
It's not the best Rocky movie of all time, but it is a realy good one, and for beeing number so much, that's an impressive stunt. More than worth it's ticket price."

","It should be no surprise, that having Sylvester Stallone still with producer and writing credits behind this movie, and also in front of the camera, that this turned out to be such a solid movie. This movie is developing a new character in the series, the strong - headed, but good-hearted, Adonis Creed, son of the late Apollo Creed. It follows the Rocky movies template to the letter, in that it tries to balance the protagonist's personal life with his success in the ring. But there is a twist. The side story involving Ivan Drago and his son turns out to be as, if not, even more important than that of Adonis and Rocky. They're not portrayed simply as the evil opponents any more. There's more to their father and son relationship than meets the eye. This, for me, is the highlight of the movie. Acting is strong throughout, there are many touching scenes throughout between Adonis and his wife( the discovery of their child having been born deaf, Adonis's marriage proposal), Rocky reuniting with his estranged son and a grandchild he's never met before and his relationship with Adonis, whom he considers, by all accounts, as his own son. You get the inevitable fall from grace of the main protagonist, which was to be expected, and the subsequent build up and later resurgence with training montage included. Cliche some times, but highly enjoyable and entertaining."

The film had a perfect story, with hilarious scenes and also with strong scenes of drama, in this film, Adonnis Creed is exposed to strong emotions that we never saw any fighter in the saga, the same is with Rocky; The characters in the film were very good (especially Adonnis Creed, Rocky Balboa, Vicktor Drago and Ivan Drago) with very good personalities, the soundtrack was also very good, and the sound mix was perfect (able to mix the soundtrack of Creed and Rocky's soundtrack).

"Reelnerd","9","0","2","11 December 2018"," Creed II: A passing of the torch
","Reel Nerd Review: Creed II
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by: Steven Caple Jr.
Starring: Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Florian Munteanu and Phylicia Rashad
Creed II is the follow up to the surprise critical and box office hit that was spun off from the massively popular Rocky franchise of films. Jordan returns as Adonis Creed the son of the late boxer Apollo Creed who was Rocky's closest friend and one time opponent. Steven Caple Jr. takes over directing duties from Ryan Coogler who serves as producer and co-writer alongside Rocky himself Sylvester Stallone.
I loved Creed II even more than the first because it felt like classic Rocky. Whereas the first Creed much like the first Rocky was a more traditional sports themed movie the sequel goes into a full on hero vs villain soap opera. Jordan and Thompson have really great on screen chemistry and are the heart of this film. Stallone is great is great as an older wiser Rocky who is a surrogate father to Adonis.
The son of Ivan Drago, Victor comes out of the shadows to challenge Adonis. Rocky enthusiasts know that Ivan killed Apollo in the film Rocky IV. At first Adonis is reticent to fight Victor but gets baited by a shady promoter looking to make a buck and his ego overrides his better judgement. Ricky tries to talk Adonis out of fighting Victor but his mind is set and he chooses to forge ahead with or without Balboa's assistance.
What I really like is that the so called villains of the piece are not just cookie cutter baddies they have a reason and purpose for what they are doing. Ivan Drago has seen better days after his defeat at the hands of Rocky Balboa. Many of the past films in the franchise including the first Creed never spent too much time or focus on the antagonists.
I must say by the film's end I did feel for Victor and his father Ivan and for all they had endured through their lives in virtual exile. This film is very much about the sins of the fathers coming back to haunt their sons. There is fallout from the way both Victor and Adonis choose to deal with how life has treated them and neither necessarily choose the right path or choose their paths for the wrong reasons.
Needless to say Adonis takes on more than he bargained for and has a crisis of confidence and with the help of Rocky must find his way back to peak physical and emotional condition. Is this film formulaic? Yes it is but many films are and just because a particular film chooses to follow a formula does not mean it will be good or a success.
Creed II is a classic David vs Goliath story and it hits (pun not intended) all the right beats. Stallone through his script brings back all the flair and finesse that made all of the original films in this franchise so much fun and made them classics. There is a scene in this film where Rocky symbolically passes on the torch to Adonis as it his franchise now. Rocky's story has come to end and from here on out it's all about Adonis. If they make a Creed III I'll be there at the theaters ready for the next chapter in this saga."
"Troy_Campbell","7","0","1","9 December 2018"," A fist-pumping sequel.
","A few years since stunning the boxing world with an against-all-odds A few years since stunning the boxing world with an against-all-odds performance in the ring (in 2015's awesome Creed), Adonis 'Son of Apollo' Creed (Micheal B. Jordan) is now the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Yet despite all of his success and glory, the legacy of his late father still weighs heavy on Adonis' shoulders. His pride and stubbornness is pushed to breaking point when he's challenged by Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), son of the man who killed his father. Boxing movies have followed the same formula for decades: underdog + training montage + epic climactic fight = inspiration. Creed II is no trendsetter, but much like its predecessor, it delivers thrills (and feels) within the confines of convention. The script isn't the strongest and falls back on a lot of the same emotional beats as the first movie (although the Drago subplot is surprisingly effective), however there's so much energy both behind and in front of the camera that its narrative shortcomings can largely be forgiven. Replacing Ryan Coogler at the helm, relatively unknown director Steven Caple Jr. brings the requisite flair to proceedings both visually and aurally; his in-the-ring camera placement and soundtrack choices equally adrenaline pumping. As the eponymous pugilist Jordan is as riveting as ever, his superb physicality matched by his dramatic heft to give another well-rounded portrayal with more layers than expected in this type of flick. As his supportive yet fiercely independent girlfriend, Tessa Thompson is an ideal emotional sparring partner for Jordan, whereas Sly Stallone's humbled, wounded-dog Rocky has well and truly run his course in this series and needs to move on. It's not that the Italian Stallion is turning in poor performances, but his beaten down presence is now providing a thematic and narrative road block to the Creed franchise really lifting off. It arguably resorts to clichés and Rocky homages a bit too often, but this sequel still dishes up the fist-pumping rush expected from such a film."

","The first Rocky was brilliant, the five sequels were a mixed bag, and the comeback Creed proved the series could still pack a punch, so there was a good amount of buzz for another instalment to the boxing series. Basically it has been years since Adonis ""Donnie"" Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) was defeated in the ring by ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan. Buthe has scored a string of victories, culminating in a victory over Danny ""Stuntman"" Wheeler (Andre Ward) to win the WBC World Heavyweight Championship. Now a worldwide star, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend, singer-songwriter Bianca Taylor (Tessa Thompson), who has progressive hearing loss. Bianca suggests starting a new life together in Los Angeles, but Adonis is reluctant to leave his life behind in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, former Soviet boxer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), who killed Adonis's father, Apollo Creed, in the ring 30 years earlier, sees an opportunity to regain the glory that was taken from him after losing to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). With the assistance of boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle (Russell Hornsby), Drago wants to pit his son, Viktor Drago (Florian 'Big Nasty' Munteanu) against Donnie, to fight in Moscow. Rocky refuses to support Adonis's decision to accept Viktor's challenge, Donnie feels betrayed and decides to leave for Los Angeles. Adonis and Bianca settle down in a luxurious apartment in L.A. close to Donnie's adoptive mother, and Apollo's widow, Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad). As Donnie and Bianca settle on the west coast and prepare for the upcoming match with Viktor, Bianca learns that she is pregnant. Donnie recruits Tony ""Little Duke"" Evers (Wood Harris), son of his father's trainer, as Rocky's replacement. Overwhelmed with all the recent developments in his life, Donnie rushes into the match, Rocky watches it on television at his restaurant. Donnie seems confident in himself, but Viktor has some powerful shots, the match ends when Viktor lands a brutal chest shot, hitting him while he is down, he knocked unconscious and his rib is fractured, Viktor is disqualified for this illegal move. Viktor retains the World Heavyweight Championship, and becomes extremely popular in Russia, winning a series of fights given top billing. Donnie's body and ego has been shattered, he becomes increasingly disconnected from Bianca. Mary Anne reaches out to Rocky to help Donnie out of his slump, he and Adonis make up, and eventually Donnie recovers from his injury. Rocky agrees to train Donnie properly for a rematch against Viktor, who is suffering near-torturous levels of physical tests by his father. At a State Dinner, he and Ivan meet Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen), his mother, and ex-wife, for the first time several years, she abandoned them both following the loss to Balboa. Bianca gives birth to a baby girl, she and Donnie name her Amara, they are saddened when their concerns about their child come to life, their baby has inherited her mother's progressive degenerative hearing disorder. Viktor continues to taunt Donnie publicly, he is constantly pressured by his father to regain their honour. Rocky takes Adonis to a decrepit location in the California desert to retrain, describing it as a place where fighters are ""reborn"", there he Donnie undergoes a rigorous and brutal training regimen with Rocky, focusing on fighting techniques and training his body to absorb heavy impact. It is known that Viktor's fights have never lasted beyond the fourth round, something that Donnie uses to his advantage when entering the rematch in Moscow. In the tenth round, Adonis unleashes a furious rage, managing to land a sequence of effective blows, knocking Viktor down twice. Viktor's mother Ludmilla departs from the match when the fight shifts in Donnie's favour, Viktor is being emotionally knocked, and Ivan is concerned for his son as he is cornered and receiving multiple strikes without returning any blows. Rocky watches in amazement as Ivan throws in the towel, conceding the fight to Adonis to ensure his son isn't seriously injured or killed. Though Viktor is ashamed, Ivan assures his son it is okay that he lost and embraces him. As Bianca enters the ring to celebrate with Donnie, Rocky lets Donnie have ""his time"", he takes a seat and watches them from outside the ring. Viktor and Ivan are later training together back in Ukraine. Rocky travels to Vancouver to make peace with his own estranged son, Robert (Heroes' Milo Ventimiglia), and meets his grandson Logan (Robbie Johns) for the first time, noting how much he looks like Adrian. Donnie visits Apollo's grave where he makes peace with his deceased father and the burden of carrying on his legacy, and he and Bianca introduce him to his granddaughter, who is sporting hearing aids. Also starring Andre Ward as Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler, Jacob 'Stitch' Duran as Stitch, Christopher Mann as Dr. Percy Ewell and Michael Buffer (""Let's Get Ready to Rumble!""). Jordan shines as the tested boxer who faces many challenges, both in and out of the ring, Stallone has slightly less time onscreen, but remains great as the former boxer turned mentor, it is a welcome return for Lundgren still being mildly sinister, and Munteanu is equally nasty as his son, the cameo from Stallone's former wife Nielsen is alright. It may not be as fresh as before, it is a little predictable in parts, and the dialogue is somewhat clichéd, but you do root for the characters and get involved with the story, it has a well-made (and necessary) montage sequence, and the often hard-to-watch and emotional fights are gripping, a most worthwhile spots drama. Good!"

","Being a Rocky and general boxing fan, I had high hopes going into this film. Especially with the success of Creed and Drago back i was thinking we may see some of the magic that was Rocky IV. Sadly i was wrong. The story seems rushed and boring along with the fights. Within the first 5 minutes he's world champion with no meaning, you can guess the plot straight away and how it ends. Stallone seems bored and just going through the motions as Rocky (its no wonder he has hinted this may be his last film on the Rocky franchise.) The film focuses more on family life which was interesting but as with all rocky films the real wait is for the training montage. And what a disappointment. The score is lacking and there is no real power or feeling of a buzz that your left with unlike all other montages. The penultimate fight itself is good to watch with both Lundgren and newcomer Munteanu making great bad guys. But once again Adonis goes the distance only to be knocked down minutes before the end, an exact copy of his last fight. Who knows what can happen next but i won't be getting my hopes up."

","By my count, this is the 8th time that Sylvester Stallone has put on the character of Rocky Balboa. This time it comes after the resurgence of this character (and franchise) with the introduction of Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and a script that allowed Stallone to explore the character in a way that he had not previously been able to - and garnered him a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his efforts.<br/><br/>In CREED II we are back to an above average by-the-numbers boxing picture with Jordan's Adonis Creed character starting the picture on top, losing it all when he loses himself (and stops listening to Rocky) in his success only to go on a journey of redemption (by following Rocky's advice) at the end. This is, in essence, a regurgitation of ROCKY III and I was somewhat bored by it.<br/><br/>That is, until the final bout, then (gosh darnnit) I was drawn right into the melodrama, pomp and pageantry of the fight and was cheering along with the rest of the audience at all the appropriate moments.<br/><br/>In Creed II, Apollo Creed's son battles Ivan Drago's son. For those of you not up on your Rocky history, Drago (Dolph Lundgren, reprising his role) was the boxer that killed Apollo Creed (Adonis' father) in the ring all those years ago.<br/><br/>Jordan is properly cocky, arrogant, stubborn, shell-shocked, morose, repentant and cocky (again) as the script would indicate. Tessa Thompson (as his wife) deserves better material than what she is given as does Stallone, who falls back to ""being Rocky"" without anything really new here. Surprisingly, Dolph Lundgren does a nice job as the washed-up boxer who's life was ""ruined"" when he lost to Rocky at the end of Rocky IV (not a spoiler). Finally, Russel Horsnby (as the ""I just want to earn money"" promoter of the fight) and Phylicia Rashad (as Adonis' mother/Apollo's wife) are both really good in roles that deserved to be much bigger - and more fleshed out - than they were.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment from this film is the ommision of Director Ryan Coogler. He brought a visceral attitude to the series in the first CREED film and I felt that this spark of energy was just missing throughout this film with Steven Caple, Jr at the helm. It seemed, to me, that this series is quickly devolving into ""paycheck"" movies for Stallone and that really saddens me.<br/><br/>All-in-all a rather above average ""by-the-numbers"" boxing flick with a really good fight at the end of the film that is well worth sticking around for.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

"MackMonMay87","7","0","2","4 December 2018"," Creed 2 is a solid follow up, but not quite a K.O.
","""Creed"" is a brilliant way to continue the long-running and often parodied ""Rocky"" saga. Creed 2 sees Apollo's son continue on in his journey to find his own path and establish his own legacy in the ring, and how that fits in with what his father did before him. Creed 2 has some solid developments in Adonis Creed and Rocky's story, and is filled with continuity and references to the entire Rocky series that longtime fans will appreciate, but the nostalgia-factor also hurts it to a degree as well.<br/><br/>If you've seen the other Rocky films, then you'll be able to tell right off the bat what's going to happen. To be fair, in the boxing genre, there's only so many things that can happen in the storyline that can make it interesting. After all, for the actual sport itself, there's only 3 outcomes: -win, -lose, -draw. The main draw of the Rocky/Creed franchise has always been *how* the main character gets to where he is, and what circumstances surround his life at the time of the fight, not whether or not he wins.<br/><br/>Creed 2 borrows the idea of the lead getting too comfortable and too soft from success, and having to deal with a physically larger, intimidating new challenger from Rocky 3, and it borrows the Drago characters, the protagonist's shift towards a new, more grueling training method, and cultural differences/tensions (although to a lesser degree) from Rocky 4. It's like a remix of them both with Creed in the lead, instead. I will say that if you're new to the franchise and don't realize that the series is referencing itself (Star Wars: Force Awakens, anyone?), you might get more out of the storyline than someone like me who's seen every entry in the series.<br/><br/>The cast carries Creed 2 along, and every single one of them delivers and knows what fans want from these beloved characters. The last Creed saw the dynamic of Rocky having to fight cancer, which contrasted with Creed building himself as a fighter, but this time there isn't quite as interesting of a driving conflict to push things along. It's interesting to see how Drago ended up, and there's a good attempt to show that Drago's son isn't as malicious or intentionally mean as his father, but because of that, the over-the-top rage and drama of Part 4 isn't there, but the more subdued drama of other entries of the series doesn't quite fill that void as well. There's talk of Creed needing to change his boxing style, but stylistically, we don't see him learning that many actually new techniques or new strategy in detail, like Rocky does in the other films when he adapts to new opponents. The training sequence in the desert is good, but as a boxing fan, I would've liked to see them break down his training more and show the audience Creed truly changing as a fighter. (Side note: while still in incredible shape and doing a great job overall, it might just be me, but it seemed like Michael B. Jordan's hands were faster in the first Creed, just my opinion.)<br/><br/>What's missing from Creed 2 is the touch of director Ryan Coogler. As seen from Black Panther, Coogler works really well with Michael B. Jordan, and the difference in feeling between both 1 and 2 is visible and tangible. It's a shame that Stallone himself couldn't direct Creed in Coogler's absence, since Stallone is the one who created these characters after all, and would presumably know them better than anyone else. The cast and their commitment to their parts, as well as the overall context within the Rocky story propel it further than being just average for me, but I would say that boxing-drama/Rocky fans will get the most out of this sequel, and that the more casual viewer could stick with the first Creed. The next Creed should make a plan to hit a little harder when it steps into the ring."

","So when I saw that Creed II was coming to theaters this year, I became extremely excited. At the time, I had only seen Rocky 1 through 3 and Creed. Creed proved to be a massive surprise for me and grew to become one of my favorite films of the past few years. I decided this year to watch the remaining Rocky films that I hadn't: Rocky 4, 5, and Balboa. After watching them, I would definitely recommend a watch of Rocky 4 before going to the theater to see Creed II. With all of that being said, Creed II has become one of my favorite films of 2018.<br/><br/>This film is exactly what I wanted from a sequel to the first Creed. The relationship between Adonis and Rocky is maintained and is my personal favorite part of the film. The villains, Ivan and Viktor Drago, might be my favorite of the entire franchise. Like the best villains in cinema, the audience learns and understands their motivations. Tessa Thompson also gives a great performance. Although somewhat formulaic, Creed II is a fantastic follow-up and one of the most satisfying experiences in the theater that I've had this year."

","You have to Hand it to Stallone.There are only very few people out there who can create even one sequel which actually builds up a story and keeps viewers engrossed. Stallone does a perfect job of fiddling around with the world of Boxing and creating surprise story arcs just from rules of the sport. The characters are all amazing. Its really commendable how Stallone gradually enters the movie in the opening scene and slowly and gradually moves out of the Story with amazing grace. You get a Jedi like vibe about Rocky. Someone had written that it's Yoda meets Rocky film and the guy is bang on right. You will feel that Rocky's life is complete and now he deserves to live out the rest of his days in peace and without getting punched bloody or watching others getting punched so. All the other characters are simply brilliant every one of them. All characters are given just enough screen time but they convey an entire story within the short span.
The review is not complete without talking about Viktor Drago. A genius product of character who conveys everything with just eye contact and body language. This guy has very very limited dialogues but will have a powerful effect on the viewers. Viktor will surprise you and also make you sad and pity him at many points in the movie. STALLONE'S selection of Foreign Muntaneau as his conditioning is awesome and superior to Adonis at every level for real.
Old Ivan Drago has his moments but it is very clear that his will to live for himself is over and he is a broken man who has lost everything in life since the 1985 defeat at Rocky's hands so the story has not much focus on him except that he is tough on his son, you will empathise with the character . It is very clearly shown that both Rocky and Ivan have mo more fight left in them, they are at the end of their days and it's time they embrace it gracefully and both do it with grace in their own ways .There is an amazing moment for Ivan Drago at the climax but hey no spoilers.<br/><br/>The only unclear part was the reason why Creed is fighting for. Though Rocky stresses on it, it is not set in concrete like the Rocky films of past we all knew why Rocky was fighting giants like Apollo, clubber and Drago and even that tommy gunn guy. Creed I explained it perfectly Adonis was an Underdog like Rocky 1. But Creed II tries to show a concrete motivating reason but falls a bit short. That'sy i give it 8 stars if not it deserves a 9 star.
EVEN THEN if the viewer wants some tough motivation there is many such moments and plenty in the final fight. All fights, training and songs are superb. You will cringe at every punch and it will feel real too. Rocky's in- fight motivation and tip talk is amazing, Don't miss this on the big screen the fights are worth it.<br/><br/>This is an Amazing Movie. But pity that in India it has been overshadowed by Enthiran 2.0. This like other Rocky Movies and Creed I (except Rocky 5 maybe) is definitely worth more than one watch.<br/><br/>In age when Novels are being adapted to big screen and the story arcs being cut and ripped for sake of screen time , Rocky's Life is a Reel Novel and absolutely original.
Me on the other hand is waiting for Rambo 5."
"sweidman-28016","8","0","1","4 December 2018"," Good Sequel
","Creed II Review:<br/><br/>Creed II is the sequel to Creed, a spin-off to the Rocky franchise, staring Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed as he takes the challenge to fight the man's son who killed his father, Viktor Drago, a character that I didn't think was really good. I literally just watched the first one last week Wednesday because I've had the movie for almost a year and because this sequel was coming out. I enjoyed Creed and thought it was good and the same goes to this. The story was good for this. It focused more on the family aspect for Adonis which I liked. Tessa Thompson as Bianca, his girlfriend or if you've seen the trailers his wife, was very good. I think I enjoyed her performance much more in this. Her one problem in the last film worsened so it made for some good scenes bringing emotion. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky was good as usual, though he did much better in Creed. Unlike the previous one he won't earn a Golden Globe or Oscar Nomination. He did bring some good lines to the script. Back to the story, I really liked how it wasn't a ton of action and more of a drama. That being said there were some parts that slowed down quite a bit from that and they could've been paced a little better. The action scenes were good and well coordinated however. I really liked the story but there was one part that is heartbreaking that made me love it even more and the dramatic take. You'll know what part when you see it. Steven Caple Jr. directed this as his first major film and he did well. If they continue with these movies, which they probably will, I think he would be a good choice. The score was good like before bringing back the Rocky theme and such. The cinematography got increasingly better, especially during the training montages. The editing was good. It was just a good film. I do think I liked the first Creed a little bit more which slightly disappointed me because the trailers made it look even better, but I still liked it. They just had the issue of the slow paced scenes and a weak disappointing villain. I would recommend seeing it. If you liked the first you'll probably like this one!<br/><br/>My Grade: B+"
"eddie_baggins","7","0","1","4 December 2018"," Cliches and all, Creed 2 delivers
","It may not have the surprise factor of the first Creed, a film that no one really thought would be even half the film it ended up being, but by embracing its clichés and allowing its quality cast to shine, Creed 2 is one of the year's most accessible crowd pleasers and another above average entry into the franchise that won't stay down on the canvas.<br/><br/>Stepping into the shoes left behind by the first films director Ryan Coogler, relative newcomer Steven Caple Jr. may lack the imagination and filmmaking pizazz that Coogler instilled in his boxing outing, but thankfully this polished looking and well put together boxing drama gives good material to its three main cast members Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson, meaning Creed 2 is as competent outside of the ring as it is in it.<br/><br/>Allowing for ample intense boxing scenes (and a stand-out desert set training montage) to keep the long-term fans satiated, Creed 2 is just as much a family drama as it is a boxing expose, as Jordan's newly crowned world champion Adonis Creed comes face to face with demons from his family's past in the form of Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago and his boxing protégé and son Viktor (seemingly one of only a handful of male Russian names if you are to believe the movies), as well as coming to terms with fatherhood with Thompson's up and coming musician Bianca.<br/><br/>The danger with these type of films is that when the dramatic beats take over, time ticks ever so slowly, audiences impatiently waiting for the next bell to ring and the punches to fly but after Coogler's film set things up so nicely, Creed 2 feels like a natural and well-earned progression of the story, that despite not surprising you in any way, shape or form, remains an engaging and likeable experience from start to finish.<br/><br/>A lot of this likeability and entertainment stems from the interactions between Jordan and Thompson, who share an easy going and believable chemistry, while it's a joy to once more see Jordan and Stallone interact together, with the later showcasing that his Oscar nominated turn in the first Creed outing was no fluke, with Creed 2 giving the aging action star another chance to show off his more vulnerable and down to earth persona and if reports of this being Stallone's swansong as his Balboa character are to be believed, we can be thankful the classic cinematic creation has been given such an enjoyable final hurrah.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>An enjoyable treat for long term fans and equally as entertaining for casual cinema goers, Creed 2 does little to avoid its well-trodden clichés but that doesn't stop this from being another bout of rock solid feel good movie-making from the Rocky series.<br/><br/>3 ½ head weights out of 5"
"jwwalrath-227-85487","9","0","1","4 December 2018"," Liked this
","Enjoyed this as much as the first Creed. Well directed, especially considering that this is the director's first big budget film.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is that it has something missing from the Rocky franchise after IV, a really good opponent. Whereas Ivan Drago was like a machine, his son Victor is more like a vicious animal in his fighting style. He actually seems agitated while having to wait to fight. It doesn't hurt that he is a mountain of a man. He's also the most sympathetic villain in the Rocky canon. Once I learned his history and motivations, I honestly didn't have it in me to root against him.<br/><br/>The cast is great all across the board. Again, Sylvester Stallone has Rocky nailed down. Although Adonis Creed has his moments of bad decisions and lashing out in a jerky and immature manner, Michael B. Jordan does such a great job of expressing his vulnerability and raw emotion that you can't be upset at him. Although it is a small role, Russell Hornsby has an excellent scene as a pragmatic and opportunistic fight promoter. You kind of wish he was in more of this. This is also probably Dolph Lundgren's best acting.<br/><br/>The only major downside is that the movie suffers from following similar plot beats from other films in the franchise."
"alindsay-al","9","0","1","3 December 2018"," A Fantastic Sequel that brings the emotion
","I am a huge fan of the Rocky franchise and loved the first Creed film that came out a few years ago, so I was very excited to watch Creed 2 and boy this film delivered. The premise of the film sees Adonis Creed riding a high when he is challenged by Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago the man who killed his father Apollo Creed. Michael B Jordan is back in the lead in this film and he does a brilliant job, his character has such a great journey throughout this film. He has to convey so many emotions during this film and make his character likeable which is tough at times but you end up really rooting for him in this film. Sylvestre Stallone is back as Rocky and he just loves this character, he gives everything into this role to make you care about him and his relationship with Adonis Creed and it is done really well in this film. But the heart of this film in my opinion is Tessa Thompson as Bianca her relationship with Jordon is the real heart of the film and really provided an emotional performance in the film. A huge positive of the film is the anatagonists of Ivan and Viktor Drago, Dolph Lundgren is back and their story in the film is heartbreaking and dealt with really well which provides an extra layer in this film. The story in the film deals with family and how is boxing truly important compared to it. It delas with the perosnal aspect of this fight and I felt it was handled so well that it had me totally rooting for Creed in the final fight. However, the one criticsim i have for this film is that it is very predictable, if you have seen a Rocky film you know exactly how this film is going to play out. The script is great with a really good mix of drama and humour which suprisingly does work in this film. The style of the film is very grand, with amazing boxing scenes that sucked me into the atmosphere of the fight and the story very well. Overall this is a fantastic film that is one of the best films I have seen in recent memory and really deserves a watch."

"paul-allaer","6","0","1","3 December 2018"," As predictable as it is enjoyable
","""Creed II"" (2018 release; 130 min.) brings the on-going story of Creed. As the movie opens, we are in ""Kyiv, Ukraine"", where we see.... Drago (!) and someone we presume to be his grown-up son, getting up and go our for training. We then switch to Creed, now a lifetime 23-1. getting ready for a world heavyweight championship fight, which he wins fairly easily. Meanwhile, Creed is getting ready to propose to Bianca, whom we also learn is pregnant... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to reveal more of the plot should spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this latest installment in the (never-ending?) Rocky-Creed franchise is directed by up-and-coming Steven Caple Jr., although truth be told, the presence of Sylvester Stallone (who co-stars and co-wrote the script) is never far away either. Rocky is still doing his thing at Adrienne's Restaurant, with the occasional mentoring/managing of Creed. The parallels between this film and 1986's ""Rocky IV"" are uncanny. It also makes this film utterly predictable. But don't say that it's not enjoyable, because it is quite enjoyable. It's really interesting to see how carefully the Rocky franchise essentials are being used and protected in the continuation of that franchise that is ""Creed"". I find the return of Dolph Rundgren (as the original Drago) and, in a much smaller role, Brigitte Nielsen (as Drago's ex, and of course ex-Mrs. Stallone in the real world) quite good. By the time we get to the glorious last fight, I am emotional ""all in"". Now we'll have to wait 2-3 years for the next installment of this franchise...<br/><br/>""Creed II"" opened wide (and commercially successful) over the Thanksgiving weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati during its second weekend was attended okay (about 20 people). If you have seen any of the prior Rocky/Creed movies and count yourself a fan of them (and you know who you are!), I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DBD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"cinemawithcj","8","0","1","3 December 2018"," Creed II - Cinema with CJ Review
","Creed II somehow legitimises the most cartoonish (and admittedly/embarrassingly my favourite) Rocky movie - Rocky IV - and brings it into the grounded world of this new Creed franchise. It works.<br/><br/>Even when other things do not.<br/><br/>Steven Caple, Jr. takes over the reigns from the great Ryan Coogler, and while it's nice and thematic to give a relative newbie to mainstream cinema another underdog shot, you can tell this isn't quite Creed.<br/><br/>It is still very serviceable. The boxing is solid and the emotions hit you and the soundtrack rises inside you like all these movies have accomplished before.<br/><br/>Stallone has co-written a film that makes you sympathise with the logical conclusion for Ivan Drago after the events of Rocky IV, and it makes you feel for Adonis Creed's uncertainty in where his life is even after the events of the first Creed movie.<br/><br/>What the film has problems with is its propulsion. It hits so many beats it needs to hit - from the matches to the human drama to the montages - but the way in which it does it doesn't quite snatch you.<br/><br/>You can predict the way the narrative is going to go, but the characters themselves don't feel like they know why it's all happening. Creed is so caught up in his confusion that he doesn't really know why he's doing things, Rocky is a bit muddled on his choices, Tessa Thompson's Bianca has her own problems with her hearing and the threat of their child inheriting their condition, and even Ivan Drago and his one-dimensional son don't quite know what they're fighting for after they've achieved it.<br/><br/>The arcs all work themselves out, but through most of the film you don't quite feel anything that strongly. You don't quite feel Rocky facing his inner demons in the death of his friend to Ivan Drago being brought up to the surface, you don't quite feel Adonis' frustration or motivation towards choosing to fight Drago, you don't quite feel what's supposed to happen to the Dragos in Russia after playing their first hand. Viktor Drago feels like such a wasted opportunity - instead a puppet for his father's failing and losses after fighting Rocky - one just wished he was more than a powerful boxing machine. He's just an obstacle to overcome and a tough one at that.<br/><br/>Everything just feels like it's coasting and a bit more subdued here. Coogler made probably the best Rocky franchise movie not called Rocky (or only to me, IV), but Caple, Jr. plays it way too safe. There aren't as many risks, there aren't as many powerful awards worthy performances (well, none to Stallone's one in Creed), and criminally...Creed doesn't come out to James<br/><br/>Brown's ""Living in America"".<br/><br/>Creed II will get you pumped, and it might make you want to go to the gym or box. It's never going to blow your mind, and it's not the bigger and better sequel you were hoping it to be. It's a shame Black Panther took Coogler away from this sequel (albeit to make a solid and important Marvel Studios Movie), but Creed II still does the job.<br/><br/>Just not as well as the previous outing.<br/><br/>So like Rocky II. History keeps on repeating itself."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","0","1","2 December 2018"," As generic as they come, but incredibly crowd-pleasing and, ultimately, enjoyable.
","'Creed II (2018)' ought to be more thematically rich than its predecessor, thanks to its weighty central conceit, but it ends up being slightly less so thanks to a number of small but noticeable missteps, such as large chunks of time and some key character decisions being glossed over. These things do end up reducing the effect - or, maybe, potential effect - of the piece somewhat, even if they don't prevent it from being an overall entertaining and character-driven experience. Plus, the motivations and development are usually always there, if you're willing to read between the lines and, maybe, assume a little. For while it's essentially as generic a 'boxing' story as they come (franchise elements aside) and, therefore, quite predictable, it's just incredibly crowd-pleasing and, ultimately, enjoyable. The Rocky character does seem slightly under-served (both in himself and in his relationship to the lead), with Stallone's performance never reaching the heights of his last attempt and the writing sometimes seeming somewhat flat, and the construction is sometimes not quite as good as in its predecessor, with some strange edits, camera moves and an overuse of 'slow motion' in the fight scenes. The flick is also somewhat less realistic than the last and does take things slightly 'backwards', perhaps, in terms of the series' progression, though not to a massively detrimental effect (Rocky V (1990)' this is not). That's not to say, however, that the piece isn't put together more than competently - with the fights in particular feeling crunchy and character-focused - and it isn't to say that Rocky isn't a decent character, since he gets quite a large arc - as do pretty much all the core players, including the antagonistic ones - which, while sometimes underdeveloped, culminates in a fairly moving final scene. On the whole, the picture is an entertaining and engaging one that maintains the focus on character so vital in making movies of this ilk work. 7/10"

A number of previous Rocky installments had used various angles and stories but using the same formula would not work today. This was also not a simple good vs bad like Rocky 4. Depth and meaning was given to Drago about their loss and how making it in boxing was important to them as well which gave the film weight.

"hunter-friesen","7","0","1","2 December 2018"," Creed II packs a punch
","The first ""Creed"" film was an entertaining surprise that was able to be both fan service to the ""Rocky"" franchise and a great standalone story filled with rich characters and relationships.<br/><br/>The new sequel, ""Creed II"", goes bigger than the first as the return of Ivan Drago reignites a rivalry thirty three years in the making. Viktor, Ivan's son, challenges Adonis Creed to a match that will determine who will be the heavyweight champion of the world. Accepting the challenge, Adonis fights for his name and to take revenge against the son of the man who killed his father.<br/><br/>Now that Ryan Coogler has moved on to ""Black Panther"" and its sequel, the director mantle now falls to Steven Caple Jr.<br/><br/>Caple Jr. tries to imitate Coogler rather than put his own stamp on the franchise. This technique more or less works, but only because Coogler supplied a proven template that could easily be followed.<br/><br/>The film stays smoothly slow throughout as Caple Jr. allows his cast to freely take reign over the material. Sometimes this proves to be too slow and tedious, but mostly it makes the story more character driven.<br/><br/>The staple of the ""Rocky"" franchise is the fight scenes and Caple Jr. does an alright job with the two major ones. The first one doesn't make much of an impact as it comes and goes with little originality or flair. The second one, however, really comes alive as the sound of bones crunching and the whipping of the camera lends itself to a visceral experience. The original ""Gonna Fly Now"" theme is even thrown in to cap off the grueling bout.<br/><br/>From a script by Stallone and Juel Taylor, Creed II is serviceable enough in the writing department despite being wholly unoriginal.<br/><br/>The overall plot is a beat for beat recreation of ""Rocky IV"". Revisiting that story is great on a nostalgia level, but on a storytelling level it takes away from the suspense. The final fight even takes place in Moscow just to rub it in a little bit more.<br/><br/>The one area that the film truly excels in is its handling of the the relationships and interactions between characters. The conversations between the main core feel authentic and help grow the connection the audience shares with them.<br/><br/>The importance of family pops up more than once as Adonis begins his life as a father and Rocky tries to reconnect with his distant son. These include some beautiful moments of tenderness that provide a great counterweight to the stone cold fights.<br/><br/>The one character that gets the short end of the stick is Viktor, who really doesn't have any reason to be in the movie except for name recognition. In a franchise full of great opponents, this one falls to the bottom of the barrel as Viktor's development as a character is given little thought and brushed aside for more scenes of him beating guys up.<br/><br/>With the ""Creed"" series and his role in ""Black Panther"", Michael B. Jordan is on a hot streak right now. He brings his natural talents to the screen and more than delivers on the physical and emotional demands of the character. He also has that bit of charisma his onscreen father possessed all those years ago. Watching him in the ring is a sight to see as he rolls with the punches and is able to fledge out his character without any dialogue.<br/><br/>Another standout performance comes from Sylvester Stallone as his most iconic character. For two films now Stallone has naturally been able to play Rocky as the wise elder to the young prodigy. His scenes with Jordan are excellent and really lend to the emotional heart of the story.<br/><br/>Tessa Thompson does a good job as Bianca. She proves to be Adonis' rock as she and him further their relationship into parenthood.<br/><br/>Lastly, Dolph Lundgren and Florian Munteanu do a fine job as father and son combo Ivan and Viktor Drago, respectively. Lundgren can be a bit over the top at times, but he does well at being both menacing and vulnerable. Munteanu physically is more gorilla than human as he towers over his competition and stokes fear through his muscles.<br/><br/>Led by powerhouse performances from Jordan and Stallone, ""Creed II"" is able to deliver on the expectations of its predecessor. While it does fall into ""Rocky IV"" esque melodrama at times, Caple Jr.'s film finds the right balance and knows when to strike and when to let back as it sports some thrilling fight scenes along with some touching human moments."

Though he has little to sweet FA dialogue he's the infinity fighting machine of his father & as you'd expect he verses him in a fight, but it's not for the most obvious of reasons.<br/><br/>The film was pretty solid, if not a bit long & could've been snappier in a couple of places! The fight scenes were really engaging & you actually felt for Adonis when the bones of his ribs cracked, the tension of Viktor who you were wanting to back down, but didn't! The film was solid there, but dragged in other areas! But it was over all epic & some what better than the 2016 predecessor!<br/><br/>I won't spoil too much for you, but the film is pretty good & the ending might very well surprise you too!<br/><br/>9/10"

","What a spectacle to behold. Simply great performances, wonderful choreography, clever camera usage and a great addition to this long and epic saga.<br/><br/>I must state that this films strength lay in its strong performances, I wouldn't go so far as to call them magnificent, but they are good. Dare I even say slightly weaker than the first Creed motion picture, but still very strong. Michael B Jordan was a joy to behold, great work with Tessa Thompson. A very deep and visceral performance, filled with likeable emotion, but still nothing too special. Thompson I believe is truly a rising star, and shines very strongly in her dramatic performances and this is a fine addition to her cinematic anthology.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone once again really hits the mark as the classic Rocky Balboa, sparring with such finesse with Jordan. though as I already stated, I believe this to be something of a slight step down from its immediate predecessor. It is a tragedy to hear the news of his stepping down as Rocky, presently it is not known to complete certainty wether this is true or not. But if it is, this was a highly fulfilling performance, and one that will be remembered as a true highlight of his career. All of the Rocky films, but particularly in his later years in Creed, this has been his best work in some would argue, decades.<br/><br/>Steven Caple, Jr definitely has a voice that is distinct from Ryan Coogler, the fighting style definitely is different, but still consistent enough for a gentle flow between the films. The way the fight was handled was not messy, none of this film feels jittery, it really doesn't miss a single beat.<br/><br/>The cinematography was certainly of interest, the colouration focused extensively on deep and light blue hues throughout. Delivering the Drogo's an their Ukrainian/Russian roots very clearly though this clever use of colour. The angles were highly competent, nothing really to criticise, other than it felt a bit standard, definitely not bad. One moment which does standout, is the arrival of Adonis Creed during the final match, that was very interesting. The cinematography in this film was overall very competent but felt a little standard in places.<br/><br/>The screenplay, by Stallone and Juel Taylor felt was by no means bad, but it was very routine. This is something that doesn't sit well in my court of opinion. Yes, this film is good, it is exhilarating and tense, loving and fearful, but it uses the same techniques as previous instalments. Its the same stuff, played again. If it ain't broke don't fix it, which is fair enough, but it feels like a very, very similar product. This film is good, it has wondrous moments, great montages, great dialogue and chemistry, particular with the three main characters, and the more fleshing out of the Drogo antagonists was most appreciated, but it felt a little like the leftovers on Boxing day. Sure its good, but it doesn't feel like the main event that the first Creed film did, this just ain't no Christmas Turkey.<br/><br/>Therefore, while I enjoyed the film and I truly commend its strengths in (although ever so slightly weaker) performances and its directorial take, I cannot claim happiness in its overall execution. But of one overlooks these things I take flaw upon, It is still a very strong and highly enjoyable experience. 7/10"

","Coming off Creed, which in my opinion was the best film of the entire Rocky Franchise, it was going to be tough for Creed II to come close to the excellence of the acclaimed 2015 film. While it's not as polished as the first outing, Creed II succeeds in being a more emotionally satisfying entry with some truly incredible boxing sequences. There's something so special about the father-child angle to this movie, with it focusing on Ivan/Viktor, Rocky/Adonis, Rocky/Robert, Adonis/Apollo, & Adonis/Amara. This is where the film packs the biggest punch emotionally and even moved me to near tears at times. In building those scenes makes every real punch in the ring all the more important, and the fight with Drago contain real consequences. Creed II is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>9.0/10"

Just had to try and ignore it and try to watch the movie.<br/><br/>Now I'm a sucker for a boxing movie, and this one even tho you know the formula is the same as 90 percent of all boxing movies ever made. He fights, he loses, he trains, he wins. But this one is still good.
The fight scenes felt very visceral, some great shots and really good acting.
It seems that all boxing movies now shoot their fights in the tv HBO style, and this one follows that but cuts into close ups and medium close ups with great effect.
This really feels they can now let the Rocky saga finally end.
It wrapped up both Rocky's and Creeds story."

","Why do people behave like they're at their own house when they're at the cinema? I don't get it... And I'm already getting sidetracked. But yeah, people chattering for the majority of the movie and even laughing during pivotal drama scenes. Didn't feel like some guys were seeing the same film. A Spanish family were sitting on the row behind me and one of them was translating all the dialogue to Spanish! I mean, I'm glad you're such big fans of ""Rocky"", but don't go to the cinema if you're gonna have to talk over the whole thing. I'm hearing the dialogue double tracked (since I understand Spanish I couldn't help but to hear most sentences twice). Stuff like that got on my nerves, especially when you've had a long day. You wanna wind down and get some quality movie inspiration at the one place where people should be respectful to the viewing experience. I can forgive reactions such as ""Oh, look it's Dolph! He's Swedish"", ""Apollo was killed in Part IV"" or ""What happened to Brigitte Nielsen?"" etc, etc. It was honestly a distracting theatre visit. Had to get the rant out of the way, sorry.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie though. It's formulaic, yet it hits the targets. If you wanna predict the storyline then chances are you likely won't be wrong. Although there are enough layers to the characters which makes the drama worthwhile. We're on the eight film now and you know the legacy of Rocky and Creed so well at this point that I don't mind having a slower moving middle portion in the film. I wasn't as invested as I would have liked, but I was never bored by it. It's a competent drama film. What brings it down is that notion of the familiar turning points. That makes it though for this sequel to stand out more. I'm glad Drago was brought back and not made into a typical villain. That's one of it's greatest strengths, having opponents that you actually can feel a little bad for. Adonis Creed's struggle with his family life and fame at the boxing was the usual. But the actors handle the material so well that it elevates. The ending does hit a home-run and it's sends a powerful tingling down your spine. Now that's the inspirational journey I was looking for. It hit me at the end, so at least it concludes on a high emotional note. Remember, it's also the history of this series that makes the finale as strong as it is. You feel like you've run up to the last step in front of Philly's museum of art. And that's when the humanity comes back to you. You're alive and ready to fight for what you care for."

"LloydBayer","7","0","2","29 November 2018"," Creed II isn't as impressive as its predecessor, but it's a film Rocky fans cannot miss.
","At a time when Hollywood is increasingly dependent on CGI fueled blockbusters about saving the world (is it seven superhero films for 2018?), it's always a joy when an old franchise has something new to offer, much like an unexpected visit from an old friend. Right from the first Rocky film in 1976, almost every film in the franchise has managed to raise a lump in your throat. That's because the Rocky films, though fictional, have maintained an almost true to life timeline of characters for over two generations. Fans will also tell you that the Rocky films, especially the first two, were less about boxing and more about two conflicted individuals who find happiness and then closure in each other. Somewhere along, we felt a kinship while forgetting that these were just characters played by actors. Then came Creed, an unexpected but wonderful film that many believed to be a spin-off in the right direction. But as much as we enjoyed that film, little did we know (or even foresee) that this was the padded beginning of the end of a beloved 40-year-old franchise.<br/><br/>Part of what made Creed immensely watchable was the gaping wounds in Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Johnson, the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. This sequel digs deeper into those wounds and even rubs it with salt. But those wounds don't belong to Donnie alone. Opening in Ukraine, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) - the former Russian boxer who left Apollo dying in Rocky's arms in Rocky IV - is training his son Victor for a grudge match against Donnie. Whatever political undertone there was in the Raegan era 1985 film is left unexplored, instead, we are given to understand that Drago has been living in scorn for the last 30 odd years. Following the defeat at the end of Rocky IV, his wife left him and Victor, and the USSR has despised him for losing to the Americans. His only chance at redeeming himself is by using Victor to challenge Donnie, who is now the new WBC Heavyweight Champion. Although clearly outmatched in strength, height, reach and even weight, Donnie accepts the challenge. Eye for an eye maybe, but a recipe for disaster as Rocky puts it.<br/><br/>While Creed II might seem like a double-edged revenge film at first, its true intention is more about closure. New director Steven Caple Jr. gives this film a visual grandiose that surpasses its predecessor but only so much. It's bigger, longer, meaner, and stitched together with narrative clichÃ©s, but also reminds us of the frailty of relationships. This is well appointed in the effortless chemistry between Jordan and Thompson (returning as girlfriend Bianca) and between Jordan and Stallone in several scenes. Yet, the best and most tense moment in the film is a sort of face-off between Stallone and Lundgren at Rocky's restaurant. Drago blames Rocky for ruining his life. He also notices there are no pictures of him or the fight in Russia on the restaurant wall. For just a moment, you think they will pummel each other again. The story captures a lot of mental and emotional turmoil in Drago, who is thankfully not the campy villain he was in Rocky IV but a man who must make things right for himself and his son.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler's Creed was a near masterpiece in not only reviving an ageing franchise, but also giving it a fresh new narrative. The fight scenes were tense and exceptional, a feat Coogler repeated with Jordan in Black Panther. The fight scenes in this sequel are satisfying at best, safe at worst. To be fair, sophomore director Caple Jr. had big shoes to fill, and it shows. Like Rocky II, Creed II has its merits but also its flaws. It also shows that this is a film written and produced in the way fans would expect. While this could spawn a whole new generation of fans, there's also a danger to the original franchise. The danger is that we may never see Rocky (the character) again and as played by Stallone. If that happens, this film would be Stallone's last outing as Rocky. And if that's the case, we either didn't see it coming or they completely ignored a swan song in favour of fan service. Either way, not to be missed for Stallone alone. Good bye Rocky!"

","""It may not seem like it now, but... this is more than just a fight."" Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan)<br/><br/>Creed II is indeed more than just about boxing. As in the previous seven Rocky-related films, it's all about the people and not just winning or losing matches, be they championships or not. Initially Creed II is about Adonis, son of the ill-fated Apollo Creed, having a child with singer Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and challenges about the baby's potential hearing handicap possibly inherited from mom.<br/><br/>That's the fight in the first part, not terribly exciting and tedious at times. When the film moves on to the re-match fight between Creed and Viktor Drago (mountainous Florian Munteanu), the film crackles with anticipation as Creed must defend his world title against an antagonist who covets the approval of his country and his family after his father, Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) lost to Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) three decades ago.<br/><br/>Although Creed II could be taken as a tract about letting the past go, it is far more about having faith in oneself and putting family first. Lightly-experienced director Stephen Caple shows himself quite capable of filming fight sequences with ballet and emotional qualities not seen in rougher depictions such as in Raging Bull.<br/><br/>Co-writer Stallone, as he has done with previous Rocky stories, is adept at wringing sentimentality and wisdom out of the dialogue. Ivan laments to Rocky what his defeat cost him in Russia: ""Because of you... I lose everything. My country. Respect. You ever see stray dogs in the Ukraine? They go for days without food. People spit on them, they are nothing. No home. Only will to survive... to fight."" Stallone thus invests his antagonist with sympathy while he provides the reason for Ivan's fierce desire to win.<br/><br/>As the most recent iteration of the Rocky myth, Creed II is serviceable and at times poignant. The glue for this modest greatness is Sylvester Stallone, a writer of note and a one-note actor who nonetheless imbues the champ and his progeny with grit and hope."

"RforFilm","8","0","1","27 November 2018"," Creed II has the same Burning Heart from Rocky IV without going over the top. It's a worthy sequel
","If you were to ask any child of the 80's (or anyone who loves movies from the 80's) what an essential movie from that era was, chances are, they'll say Rocky IV. While a fourth movie from a boxing series may not seem like much, have you seen that movie? It's basically Rocky Balboa fighting and winning the Cold War. Okay, it wasn't that, but given it's time period and the fact that the competing fighter from the heavily controlled Soviet Union, it represented a lot of feat that a lot of Americans had about the Motherland and what could be lurking behind the Iron Curtain.<br/><br/>It may have been the silliest of Rocky movies (any Rocky movie with a robot is jumping the shark), but it embraced its tone enough that I still recommend it as an entertaining film. Like a lot of fans, I had also speculated about Dolph Lundgren's character of Ivan Drago. What would have happened to him after his loss and the fall of the Soviet Union? Would he still be involved with the world of boxing? Thankfully, these and more questions have been answered in Creed II.<br/><br/>After the events of Creed, Adonis Creed (played by Michael B. Jordan) has become the heavyweight champion and seems to be enjoying his new celebrity status. In celebration, he proposes to his longtime girlfriend Bianca (played by Tessa Thompson) in which she accepts. They also agree to relocate to Los Angeles to be closer to the Hollywood scene and be closer to his mother Mary Ann Creed (played by Phylicia Rashad). While this concerns Adonis who doesn't want to leave Rocky Balboa (played by Sylvester Stallone) alone, Rocky seems okay now that he's recovered from his cancer treatment from before.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the Ukraine, former boxer Ivan Drago (played by Dolph Lundgren) has been living a quiet life after being exiled by his home. But he's not alone. He's been training his son Viktor (played by Florian Munteanu) to become a boxer as well. Once ready, Ivan and Viktor travel to the states to challenge Adonis for a match. Nobody, especially Rocky, wants Adonis to take the fight, as Ivan was the one who killed his father in the ring. Adonis accepts it for the sake of his family history. At the same time, he finds out that Bianca is pregnant and he's afraid that the baby will inherit his wife's deafness.<br/><br/>Like a lot of sequels, Creed II does follow a lot of the typical second movie tropes like friends falling out, ego getting in the way, and a later ""eye of the tiger"" style learning to earn that hunger to win. The good news is that it still works thanks to the characters from before. Everyone, especially Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, are interesting and I want to see what's going to happen with them. Whether they fall or rise, their story is never boring and feels good in the place of the Rocky universe.<br/><br/>What makes this work better then I thought is the return of Ivan Drago. He isn't just a man of few words and punches like in Rocky IV. He's a man with a lot of anger, who blames his fight with Rocky as the start of his downfall, who only want's to reclaim the former glory of his days in Russia. It's clear that a lot of inspiration can from the new YouTube series Cobra Kai. Like in the show, they took a character who was a black and white villain, and added more depth to his personality.<br/><br/>Adding to that is his son, who is no joke. I have no idea to what preparation was made, but the movie did a great job at making this beast of a man who makes Adonis look small in comparison. This makes the upcoming fight very anticipated.<br/><br/>Without giving much away, if there's anything to admit, its that if you seen the other Rocky movies, then chances are, you'll know some of the outcomes. It's a sports movie, but I think a lot of focus is trying to make it a part of the Rocky storyline...perhaps a little too closely.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight Rocky IV posters out of ten. Creed II continues both the stories of Rocky IV and Creed in fantastic ways that I'll be ready for a Creed III. It'll depend on how long Stallone will remain a part of this, but even if he leaves, this series is in good hands with Michael B. Jordan. Go see it, take a punch, and see it again."

Creed believes he will heal the wound of his dead father if he defeats Drago's son, but this mistake nearly costs him his title and his soul.

The movie is more than a boxing film it's a film of passion and emotion as it's about love, family, and life and winning at it all is possible thru hard work and determination and going thru pain when you get knocked down and hurt.

"1218gwr","8","0","2","26 November 2018"," More about the characters than trading punches; and kudos to Lundgren
","When reviewing Creed II, you can't help comparing it to its predecessor. My immediate impression was, there seemed to be a lot less ring time, and perhaps less action, in Creed II. At least this is how it felt. But I believe this was effective in making this film different, as it focuses more on the character's personal journeys and not as much on an over-the-top climactic fight (though you can still feel the punches in the film's fight sequences).<br/><br/>Other reviewers have discussed the relationship between Adonis and Bianca. But what is also worth noting is the performance of Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago, and the relationship with his son. Not that there are any long soliloquies from Ivan. This is intentional, as it was in Rocky IV. During the release of that movie, Lundgren appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show, where the host (I believe it was Johnny) commented how Lundgren had so few speaking parts. To this, Lundgren responded that, because he spoke little, what he did say carried a lot more weight (or words to that effect). In Creed II, Lundgren is able to convey a great deal about Drago's emotional pain with a relatively small speaking part (much of it in Russian). He manages to add some depth to the character that was perhaps wanting in Rocky IV. It's interesting how his pain plays out in his relationship with Viktor, and the final glimpse of them together at the end of the film is satisfying, and perhaps even redemptive.
Maybe Dolph should do a Drago sequel. :-)"

","Creed 2 isn't quite as glorious as the first Rocky film, but it's leaps and bounds better than the Ryan Coogler helmed original. This is important, as Adonis Creed (Michael B Jordan ) should be an interesting character study; his internal conflicts with an inherent legacy make him a nice contrast to Stallone's goodguy Rocky. Thankfully Creed 2 handles characterisation much in the way the original Rocky does, with plenty of quiet moments and large doses of realism. It's predictable, and the fights, along with the Drago sidestory, are merely interesting asides. Ultimately, this is an excellent film with likeable characters that just happens to be about boxing."
