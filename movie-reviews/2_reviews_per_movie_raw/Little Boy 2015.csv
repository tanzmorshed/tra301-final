","Not much to say except I'm really annoyed by the critics sometimes. This movie is solid. Has a vintage old-time feel to it. Well acted. Deals with the problems of the times (racism, bullying, war, alcoholism, death) in a dramatic, humorous and clever way.<br/><br/>Great story. Whole family loved it. They dealt with faith in a reasonable way. They pulled heartstrings without being saccharine. The critics are just so dead-set on hating any movie that deals with faith, especially the Christian faith. This movie soft-pedals that faith - but it definitely is a strong element.<br/><br/>Wholeheartedly recommend this movie to families who want to be able to go out together for a movie, and be inspired and entertained at the same time."

","This isn't a perfect movie - but it's a very, very good one. I hardly ever write reviews, but after seeing the really terrible critic reviews this movie has received, I thought I owed it to any potential watchers to let you know that I believe the Metascore is very misleading.<br/><br/>This movie really has no fatal flaws - the story is well-built, the acting is very good (much better than I expected), and the filming is beautiful. The tone of it really gives the right feeling of the time that the movie is set. The involvement of religious themes is only objective, and is viewed from different perspectives.<br/><br/>The only thing I'm missing is a bit more development in a few of the supporting characters, but that didn't really take much away from the overall impression i was left with. Pretty much everything else works really well in my opinion.<br/><br/>So if you're considering watching it, please do! It's a beautiful movie that is guaranteed to make you smile (:"

","It is difficult to express in words the absolute beauty of this film.This movie truly grips your soul as you experience with Little Boy the meaning of relentless, mountain moving faith, the courage to face one's fears, the ugliness of bullying and racism, the power and beauty of forgiveness, and the great hardships that war brings to families. This movie had me crying one moment and laughing the next, but most of all, its impact has remained with me long after I left the theater!It has truly inspired me to never give up and to keep believing when there is no evidence to encourage me to do so. As a middle school teacher, I was blessed with the opportunity to take all of our students to see this film. It was incredible to watch the student's reactions to the film! They were cheering, laughing, and crying all throughout just as I was! Their comments after give tribute to this movie's life changing messages! I have several ""little boys"" who are often picked on for their ""fun size"" (a name they have given for their short stature), and the common reflection for each of them was ""Little people can do great things."" and ""Size doesn't keep you from greatness""! I am truly praising Jesus for this powerful, inspirational, film that has already blessed me, my family, and my students beyond measure! God bless you for making such a beautiful film!"

","Finally a movie that you can take the kids to where both the parents and children love,love,love the film. This is a well filmed beautifully acting movie with a message that can change our world for good.It will make you laugh, cry, applaud, be inspired, dream, pray, and feel good about life after viewing it. The little boy does an incredible job acting along with the rest of the cast. David Henrie definitely has a movie acting career in his future after an award winning performance. It was refreshing to see Kevin James in a different more serious role even though he still had the audience laughing! This is how movies should be made for families and anyone else wanting a clean, uplifting film that everyone from all ages can enjoy! This is one movie you don't want to miss especially while it is in theaters as the sound effects and tract are amazing as well!"

","Little Boy is a poignant movie which gripped me from beginning to end as I followed this child's journey to bring his father home from the war. He displays a faith and determination only a child can have and what makes it believable is that the movie does a great job in establishing the little boy's love for his father, who is his best friend, as his driving force. Jakob Salvati, who plays the little boy, Pepper, delivers a brilliant performance. The movie dealt with issues relevant to the time in a sensitive yet satisfying manner. It made me laugh, cry, and challenged me. With Hollywood delivering so many unsatisfying movies, this is a must see. I have already viewed this twice and will likely see it again. Don't miss this heartwarming story."
"Ramascreen","8","26","35","24 April 2015"," A good cry
","Ya know, I pride myself as a macho strong, independent man, I don't have a pick up truck nor have I engaged in caber tossing like they do in that Scottish athletic games, but I don't easily cry while watching a film, no matter how sentimental it can get. The last time I shed tears was when watching ""Armageddon"" the scene in which Bruce Willis said goodbye to his daughter played by Liv Tyler. But my holy freakin' goodness, LITTLE BOY had me literally crying like four times at the screening, four times, man! And ya know what, I didn't regret it at all. This is a very powerful, inspiring, can-do film, led by child star, Jakob Salvati whose talent is bigger than his appearance.<br/><br/>From co-writer/director Alejandro Monteverde, LITTLE BOY is about an 8-year old boy, Jakob's character, Pepper who believes that he has what it takes to bring his father home from WWII alive. He and his father are really close, so when his father (Michael Rapaport) leaves for war in place of his oldest son, it sets off events in that family, in that community, in that small town that will get them all learning about tolerance, faith, and love. Jakob is given a task by the local priest (Tom Wilkinson) and this list of assignments are supposed to help bring his father back, one of them is for Pepper to befriend the only Japanese resident, Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), it's an uphill task for Pepper seeing that his older brother and the whole town are blaming Hashimoto for the war.<br/><br/>Christian community might see this film as something that they can encourage their members to go to theaters and see with their families and I think they should, but LITTLE BOY is not a Christian film. It also wrestles with the idea of believing in one self, one's will power. But what's great about this film is that it doesn't take sides, it only goes to show that many people hold different beliefs, doesn't always mean that some are more right than others. This child actor, Jakob, blew me away. He's so effortless, you feel his pain and agony, Jakob makes it so easy for us to feel sad for Pepper, makes us want him to be a better kid each day. If you're looking for a good cry, LITTLE BOY is the prefect movie for you, it's a tear jerker but not in a sense that it alienates certain audiences, because anybody who's dealt with loss or separation, anybody who doubts the idea of a mountain-moving faith, can relate to LITTLE BOY.<br/><br/>Please read more at Ramascreen.Com"

","I was captivated by the acting, as well as the cinematography and special effects contained on this great production. I'm glad to see that the filmmakers and actors are bringing this kind of messages to the world through art reminding us that love is the force that brings us all together and that's the path to follow as humanity. I loved Eduardo Ver√°stegui's performance by showing Little Boy the importance of faith. It made me think about how we must have the strength to defend the truth even when some people don't see it. It also made me remember that if we have the courage to go the right way and follow our goals or dreams, based on good intentions, God will give us what we need to get trough difficulties. Not only is it a very entertaining movie with a deep emotional content, but it is also an example of kindness and compassion, great job on bringing all together. The film made me cry, laugh and feel identified at some point with the characters. It takes you on an exciting emotional roller coaster with a beautiful message at the end that will take your breath away."

","""Little Boy"" is an excellent film! It was very well done with period costuming and set designs. It contains a plethora of stories inside the story itself taking the audience through many different adventures. The emotion was high throughout the film with variations in amusing entertainment and very emotional moments that grab your heart drawing you right in! Between tears of joy and tears of sorrow absorbing the emotions of the story with the characters themselves... I could hardly keep my eyes dry. The acting was excellent and the cast was very well put together. Little Boy himself could not have been better cast! He is a gem in this story! I would go back to see it a second time....

I was even more impressed when I with the many plot twists that kept me guessing - I realized at a certain point that there was no predicting in this movie! I had the pleasure of watching a Q&A with the producers and the people behind this film have a great heart and purpose for making this film, which for me is all the more reason for this project to succeed and reach every corner that it can manage to.

"sadamer","9","5","6","28 April 2016"," A real gem
","I rarely write reviews. This movie Little Boy is a real gem. I don't get why we haven't heard so much about it. The scenario is just perfectly written. The cinematography is really beautifully executed and the actors are all great. I was really moved, and actually normally it's is not at all what I'm searching in a movie (I'm much more into the horror/thriller/action genre). So actually I started looking, sure that I will hate it. It was the opposite. But what I loved the most in this film is the honesty of the film. You feel that it is an honest movie. You have so many movies that sometimes that are just pretending. Here it is true emotions. Really awesome film! I will remember it."

","It's hard not to like this movie when you watch it. It has the innocence of forest gump with a touch of sadness. The writing and acting of this movie are simply great. The little boy does a great job. There isn't much more you could have asked of him in this movie. You can actually feel the sadness for the little boy, and without revealing the ending can see that happiness might not be as was expected but is still a part of Hollywood. The writers did a great job of trying to see the world through a child's eye. While showing some of the ugliness of it on the outside. The relationship between the little boy and the ""jap"" is very touching and funny. You can tell he is genuinely concerned for the kid more so than maybe anyone else in the movie. Well done and worth the view."
"BombVark","7","7","10","25 August 2015"," Moderately interesting film
","I am surprised though perhaps I shouldn't be by the rabid dislike of the film by some reviewers. Apparently any film which remotely suggest the existence of a higher being sets them off. I found the film to be rather fair, showing the offsetting views of Fr. Oliver and the atheist Mr.Hashimoto whose character is much more sympathetic than a Christian character would be in most other films of our day. <br/><br/>My problems with the film lie elsewhere. 1) David Henrie's character seems to undergo an enlightenment during the course of the film, but little explanation or cause is given. 2) Why does the father go to war when the son can't? His duty to his country? What about his duty to his family? What about the commandment: Thou shall not kill? It is assumed here that joining the war was the only thing to do. 3) The movie seems to indicate the dropping of the A-Bombs were necessary to end the war, this is nonsense despite what most Americans believe. 4) I should watch the ending again because it seemed like the mistaken identity was due to the fact Busbee carried his dog tags in his boots? This would seem to be both uncomfortable and most likely.<br/><br/>Sadly this had the potential to be a top-notch movie but falls short because of plot holes and ducking the hard questions. Some reviewers liked this film more than I did and I understand that. But if you are looking for a film to watch with your family this one is one of the more interesting ones because it raise some issues which you won't see in standard Hollywood fare."
"smoothgrind-58805","5","33","66","30 April 2015"," Christian Faith = You Get What You Want
","Other reviewers who have said this movie does not hit you over the head with its message of faith are correct. It is more subtle than most of the so-called faith-based movies out there. Furthermore, there really is much to like about this movie, from the outstanding performance of the young Jakob Salvati to the anti-bullying and anti-racism themes. And the anguish of the priest, played beautifully by Tom Wilkinson, who wants to encourage ""Little Boy""'s faith but who knows that prayers often go unfulfilled, gives the film a more realistic feel than it might have had. In fact, had the movie ended when it ""should"" have, after the first of its two ""endings,"" I could have lived with the message that faith helps you get through hard times and I would have given the film a 7. But no, the movie had to cave in to the demands of its Christian creators and send us away with the false message that if your faith is strong enough, it will bring you whatever you ask for. This is what the faithful desperately want to believe, so when the movie tells them that yes, it is true, of course they go wild in their effusive praise. There is a good movie locked inside this Christian fable. It's too bad it wasn't allowed to escape."

"mhol111964-754-567942","6","19","36","26 April 2015"," Not bad but not great
","I saw it today and it was not a bad movie but I was a tad disappointed. The trailer had me thinking that it would be Big Fish-like. The trailer made it look like a fantasy drama that would be ""instant classic"" material but it's really a religious film. It's beautifully shot and I liked the symbolism, and it was quite emotional. However, The film has problems. For instance, Pepper doesn't even really have powers. He only just has ""faith"" and a to-do list, which (for me) was quite disappointing. Another thing is that our protagonist Pepper, while not unlikeable, is quite annoying at times. Like when he does that pose thing, he makes those grunt sounds which went out of hand and started to get on my nerves. Also, there is the ending. Like, for a second I was like ""Oh, so they're going the ""tragic"" route"". Then it got all ""happily ever after"". How Original. I also thought it was a bit too melodramatic at times and quite (I don't usually like this word but it's true here) pretentious. Like on the previews, they make it out to be so ""amazing"" and ""uplifting"", when in reality, it's just a mediocre religious film. I am not trolling. I did not hate the film but I don't really recommend it either. For what it is, it's not a bad film. It has it's qualities. The acting is decent, it has a bit of heart, and it has a pretty accurate depiction of the true events that the film is inspired by. I can see some people enjoying it, but in the end, I can't say I was impressed with it. I'd say give it a go. You might like it but you might not be impressed. If you're a ""Jesus freak"", you may as well enjoy it. Overall, I thought this film was a little on the okay/mediocre side."

When I read it is going to be about WWII I kind a thought to see some action in it, but there were no real action. The story line was rather predictable, but still interesting to watch to relax. I didn't get anything big out of this movie, but for sure this movie may be great for kids and for family, because it is about believing in dreams, how racism is bad (by seeing how disgusting those who are racist looks), and it kind a gives a view in history of WWII, small enough to not traumatize kids too much as well touch of sadness is in it, what may bring empathy in some of those who will watch it .

","This film is well made. It is a Disney-like story about an American family torn apart by the second world war.

"MartianOctocretr5","7","2","2","4 December 2015"," Nice approach to a familiar theme
","This movie was a new approach at story telling. I can't remember off hand any other movie that was structured like this. <br/><br/>It certainly works. The story is told through the titular little boy who is literally just that: a child who is small for his age to the extent his parents take him to a doctor to see if something is wrong. He is small in size, but not in dreams, hope, or faith. His father has marched off to fight in World War II, and the builds upon his heart felt wish of his father's safe and swift return.<br/><br/>Much of the action is allegorical, and the story does need to be told that way. However, the flip side of that coin is that some of the ideas are heavy handed and intrusive. One example is little boy's interaction with a Japanese man, to address the interment controversy which in turn looks at the atmosphere of bigotry that caused it. This aspect of the story is the film's strongest sub-plot, but there are a few minor problems on how it was utilized. The interpretation of the child calling upon spiritual powers was overdone, and inaccurate which undermined what the movie was meant to say.<br/><br/>Excellent acting and a well devised script. The characters are involving, and the story contains all the faith and optimism that it is meant to convey. Ultimately, the concept of the movie works well, and the ending supports it."
"trvlers-77920","3","19","42","8 May 2015"," 3.8/10
","The little boy at the center of ""Little Boy"" pulls a stunt repeatedly which, ostensibly, is intended to be poignant. Eight-year-old Pepper Flint Busbee (Jakob Salvati) sticks out his fingers, scrunches up his face, squints his eyes, screeches with all his might and wills an object to move. Maybe it's a glass bottle. Maybe it's a mountain. But sure enough, through the power of magic or trickery or a well-timed seismic shift, he achieves his goal. Eventually, he tries to use this ""ability"" to bring home his beloved father from battle in World War II. And by this point, his patented move‚Äîwhich was merely shrill and annoying‚Äînow seems just plain goofy and even a little crass. This emotional disparity is emblematic of so much that's wrong with Mexican director Alejandro Monteverde's film, which he co-wrote with Pepe Portillo. It's meant to be a tale of uplift for faith-based audiences, but instead wears viewers down with a heavy-handed narrative, an overbearing score and voice-over that spells out everything in cringe-inducing, folksy tones. ""Little Boy"" takes place around the time of Pearl Harbor in the fictional, coastal California town of O'Hare. ""Just like you see in postcards,"" we're told, as if we couldn't recognize its idyllic quaintness for ourselves. The nostalgia is spread thick here like sugary mounds of frosting. Compared to most movies aimed at Christian viewers, though, this one at least has solid production values. Pepper, who's small for his age (hence the titular nickname), suffers merciless bullying from the bigger kids. His only friend is his father, James (an earnest and enthusiastic Michael Rapaport), who shares his love of comic books, movies and made-up adventures. But one day, James has to go off to war in place of his elder son, London (David Henrie), who's stuck staying home with flat feet. Pepper is understandably devastated to see his father leave, but a sermon at the town's church about the trans-formative power of faith inspires him. He visits the priest (Tom Wilkinson, managing to provide substance in just a few scenes), who gives him a to-do list of good deeds to help him bring his father back: feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, etc. It's a ludicrous notion, of course. Then he adds a task that sounds like the toughest of all to Pepper: befriend Mr. Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), an elderly Japanese man who has returned home to O'Hare after being released from an internment camp. Hashimoto has been the target of universal scorn during the war‚Äî""Little Boy"" doesn't shy away from the cruel racial epithets of the era‚Äîand even some vandalism. But, as a favor to his friend, the priest, he reluctantly agrees to spend time with this misfit kid. The result is an overly feel-good take on the ""The Karate Kid,"" as the reclusive and misunderstood man becomes a father figure, mentor and protector to this bullied boy, who has a retro version of the Cobra Kai to contend with. Tagawa brings a quiet dignity to the role, which is really more of an idea than a fully fleshed-out character. In a similar waste of talent, Emily Watson gets little to do but worry and weep as James' long-suffering wife. Speaking of the cast, there's a curious overlap here with last week's ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,"" which is terrible in a totally different way. Besides that film's star, Kevin James (who tones it down here as the town's widower doctor), Henrie had a supporting role in the comedy as a valet parking attendant at the Wynn Las Vegas. And Eduardo Verastegui, who played the hotel's suave head of security, has a small role here as a fellow priest. (He's also a producer alongside husband-and-wife Mark Burnett and Roma Downey, purveyors of such faith-based properties.) But no amount of talent can counter-balance the garish sight of the townspeople cheering for Little Boy, the character, as well as Little Boy, the codename of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The mixture of jubilation and death‚Äîas well as a fantasy sequence in which Pepper wanders through an ashen wasteland, surrounded by corpses‚Äîis all rather queasy- making. ""Little Boy"" also milks tears out of a major character's fate, but the film's young, blue-eyed star isn't quite up for the challenge of those heavier scenes, or anything beyond being moppet-like and determined. There's no way that a movie like this can do anything but reward such a character for his faith. But even by the standards of this genre, the sentimental way in which the story twists and wraps up is as shameless as it is schmaltzy."

"StevePulaski","2","26","62","24 April 2015"," A film so far outside of reality's ballpark it's playing a different game
","This time last year, we were granted with ""Heaven is for Real,"" a miserably schmaltzy film that was so overwrought in its intentions and portrayal of emotions that it easily merited a spot on my list for the worst films of the year. This year, however, we have ""Little Boy,"" one of the first faith-based films of the year along with ""Do You Believe?,"" a film that will likely earn a place on this year's list. Films like this should insult the audience, if they are smart enough to know they are being condescended to through the use of soft-lighting and cinematography, an overbearing musical score that lets them know when they should feel happy and sad, and sole lines and sequences desperately made to extract tears from the audience who are temporarily blindsided by the fact that these particular events exists so far outside the ballpark of reality it's playing a different game.<br/><br/>""Little Boy"" concerns an America that's plunged in a tumultuous period; World War II's impact and scope is growing, the army needs more soldiers and young men on the frontlines, families are being separated for indefinite periods of time, and Japanese citizens are just being released from internment camps, causing civil unrest. We focus on the Busbee family, particularly Pepper (Jakob Salvati), a stout seven-year-old who is the subject of bullying for his short stature. Despite this, he finds a great connection with his imaginative father James (Michael Rapaport), until he is called to fight in Hiroshima, leaving Pepper with his mother (Emily Watson) and his heavy-drinking older brother London (David Henrie).<br/><br/>During this time, Pepper seeks out ways to exercise and strengthen his personal faith, which a Reverend informs him could help bring his father back. However, this result will only occur if his faith is strong enough. Pepper loves magicians, particularly the great Ben Eagle, who calls him on stage during one of his shows to move a soda bottle. Eagle informs Pepper that the only way to do it is to have incorruptible faith and even the slightest shred of doubt - easily brought on by a crowd full of ridiculing children Pepper's age - will prohibit the bottle from being moved. After a lot of grunting and screaming on Pepper's part, the bottle moves, and Pepper believes the stronger his faith gets, the more likely his father will be brought back home safe and sound. During his journey of self-discovery, he meets Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), an ostracized Japanese man who also helps him recognize his faith.<br/><br/>The level of frothiness in this film cannot be accurately stated. Scenes carry immense artificial weight to them, bathing themselves in beautiful scenery and loud and obvious musical numbers that cast blatant moods of either ""happy"" or ""sad"" unto the audience. Throw in Salvati's innocent face, his perfectly combed blonde hair, and his teary-eyed plea for his father to stay home, and you have precisely the kind of emotional sentimentality I hate. Not a single moment in ""Little Boy"" is genuine, as it all feels conjured up through deliberately facile means of exploiting the audience's emotional complexes. This, in turn, making them think they've seen a good film when they've really just been played for fools.<br/><br/>Shedding tears to a film is something I'm no stranger of; I've probably done it more than a great deal of my peers to films that didn't even upset them. If a film can extract emotion from the audience, that means it has made them care about the characters on screen through numerous different things, including acting, directing, and writing. It's a powerful thing, and when it happens to you, you're almost surprised at yourself. However, ""Little Boy"" is going for the easily extractable tears. Its emotion comes from the aesthetics and how they manipulate the viewer and not from the characters or the situations themselves. Here, scenes beg weeping and other scenes beg you to have an ear-to-ear smile; nothing is subtle, nothing is left to the imagination.<br/><br/>The film's tagline is ""Believe the impossible,"" which is fitting because that's the only way one will receive much enjoyment from this film. Watching a seven-year-old stand before an enormous mountain and eventually come to move it through his faith may be a cute idea in theory, but to watch it happen, in a film that desperately wants you to believe what cannot be done regardless of how much faith a person has among countless other manipulative filmmaking strategies, makes for a desperately cloying movie-going experience.<br/><br/>NOTE: Take a second look at the title while you're at it too; recall high school history class if you must. It doesn't just mean what you think it means, and because of that, it adds one more frightening element to this film."
"pbtax","9","3","4","25 August 2015"," Nice film
","To be sure, this movie is melodramatic, but less so than Saving Private Ryan, for example. Also, improbable- but again, less than Saving Private Ryan and a large portion of the movies out there.<br/><br/>What is it? Just a very sweet (but not insulting), well acted movie that moves along at a brisk pace. The protagonist is terrific, and it is hard not to sympathize with him.<br/><br/>It is also a movie that has nothing disgusting. So it is a nice family movie, though it is NOT a children's movie.<br/><br/>The negative ratings, predictably, focus on the positive depiction of the Catholic Church. I would say it is realistic."

","Must watch it now. Its such an inspiring and motivational movie that will uphold your spirit in enthusiasm through faith in God. The movie has a little to offer from any spectrum, whether your Christian or not. Overall, its a great family movie. You will not be disappointed. Its a movie we can all relate in some sense. It deals with a very interesting motif from a boy seeking and yearning to regain his love for his father. I believe that this movie also makes justice for all of the veterans that have fought in war. Although the movie is not as ""actiony"" as I would have hoped, it brings just the right amount of hope and drama to make it a great film. The combination of the screenplay, director and actors make the perfect unity to explode a great defining film in which enhances the audience knowledge on war. :)"

If you believe it, you can make the impossible possible.<br/><br/>It is funny and sad story in one. Beside all of it, i always love father-son/daughter relationship themes. And i think this movie is done it right. this is about a kid tries his best to make his father back from war. he is willing to do anything to make his father back even for the impossible things or let say stupid things that he believes is the right thing to do.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed all the elements in this movie, the story, the casts, everything... my prediction is Jakob Salvati and Emily Watson will get nomination for Oscar next year for the best actor and best supporting actress, they both are brilliant. Jakob Salvati is so very adorable, he is really great in this movie and Emily Watson is very mother like. i really admire both of them, beside the other casts, they are great too.<br/><br/>Don't hear/read what the critics said... better to watch it first and see you will like in the first 5 minutes or not. if you like the first 5 minutes, i think you will enjoy the rest of the movie... and wait till the end... i believe you will get your tears down as well... i hope you enjoy the movie :)"

","You know how the National Film Registry usually waits a few years or sometimes, decades before they preserve a movie; for being culturally, historically, aesthetically significant? No need to wait on this one, just add ""Little Boy"" to the list.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece and is movie-making at its finest. There are four main characters: the small undersized boy, the boy's mother, the priest, and the Japanese American. What makes the movie amazing is how the townspeople are teaching the boy about life.<br/><br/>The Little Boy begins asking questions and turns the tables on the entire town. They all learn about life through him. The movie takes twenty-one out of twenty-four genres and rolls them into one: mystery, love, drama, comedy, history, war, etc. Watch/buy it again, give the DVD out as a gift to enemies/friends: they will admire you for your insight and may invite you over to the apartment/cottage/house for dinner.

"jimfarley1025","2","12","25","28 December 2015"," Confused clich√©s
","I started to watch this for something to have on while waiting for football to start. I stayed to finish it because I was fascinated at just how awful the story was and wondered if, at any point there was going to be an attempt at elevation of the story, but no, nothing, never. It's been quite some time since I felt compelled to write a review on IMDb, but when I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this film, I felt duty bound to add balance. Apparently, the director/writer of this film is of the opinion that complete ignorance of a topic shouldn't stand in the way of you making a story about it; not ignorance of the history of WWII or feudal Japan, ignorance of Catholic catechism, or even ignorance of human nature and cognition. None of these things stood in the way of the creation of this truly unbelievable story; and by unbelievable, I mean literally not-believable. Had I desired to suspend disbelief for the sake of the story, which should be the desire of the film maker, this movie continually destroys that suspense through one glaring display of ignorance after another.<br/><br/>In addition to the flaming historical ignorance that composes the plot elements of this movie, there is a complete lack of character development and a story line so facile I must believe that it was conceived by an eight-grader. The most amazing element of this film is that so many high-quality actors devoted the minutes it took them to phone in a basic performance. The child actors were actually better than one often gets, but with such facile material to work with, it's difficult to credit their performances with any redeeming value."

A very positive movie that reinforces the fact that Hope is always one of the best thing that a person has and as long as you can in believe in it, it can change your life. <br/><br/>Tom Wilkinson as usual has a powerful screen presence, David Henrie (London) is gritty, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Hashimoto is seasoned as always but the true star of this movie is Jakob Salvati.

It sends a message that even without faith, holding on to hope is very important, and this movie shows us that we can be a different breed of human if we believe in ourselves and invest our energy for better outcomes in life no matter what issues or problems we face.

"punitivedamages","9","7","15","22 April 2015"," Little Boy - good stuff
","One of the knocks on ""Christian"" films is that they lack subtlety; the message is wielded like a blunt force instrument, and the story resolution comes by way of a pat ending, reached always through faith in God. Heroes and villains are drawn in stark contrast, and the heroes are the ones that believe in God the most. I don't agree it is a valid knock in all cases, but I appreciate at least that criticism, and see the point. <br/><br/>Then there is Little Boy. First, I would hesitate to call it a ""Christian"" film at all, as the message seems broader than that, but what the heck - call it a Christian film. In fact, call it a Catholic film. Perish the thought! <br/><br/>Little Boy is a meditation on many things - the belief that faith without works is dead; the belief that works without love are also dead; the corporal works of mercy. All of these are Catholic beliefs, some uniquely so. But they are also all human. Should we treat each other well because we love God? Or because it's right? Does it matter? <br/><br/>In the end, Little Boy is also a mediation on the nature of faith itself. Does our faith in God change God? Or cause him to do what we want Him to do? Or does our faith simply allow us to see what God does through the eyes of trust and love, through the eyes of a little boy gazing upon a father that he worships? The formula in a lot of Christian films is that faith helps us get what we want. The reality is that faith helps us to deal with what God wants. There is a big difference. <br/><br/>I enjoyed Little Boy, but not simply for its message of faith. We can all see ourselves in one character or another as they all deal differently with the tension of WWII. Overall, Little Boy is a touching and poignant film, well worth a shot."
"oscaralbert","8","5","10","16 May 2015"," In a clever allegory promoting nuclear warfare . . .
",". . . the title character LITTLE BOY is conflated with the real-life bomb bearing that code name, which instantly vaporized some 80,000 mostly civilian Japanese folks on August 6, 1945. (Note that if Sony Corporation had its hooks into ALL U.S. theater chains, this flick would have been seen by even FEWER people than was THE INTERVIEW.) One hour, 13 minutes, and 45 seconds into LITTLE BOY, this film's soundtrack joyfully blares the Sunday School standard ""This Little Light of Mine"" while archival footage of Hiroshima's apocalyptic Death Cloud brightens the screen! (This may be the first documented and totally overt ""Nukes for Jesus"" message EVER conveyed by American mass media.) To hammer this point home, 39-inch-small LITTLE BOY next pictures HIMSELF as his namesake Nuclear Holocaust Capsule, standing as the ONLY human alive deep in Hiroshima's Ground Zero Crater! The not-so-subtle main message here is that LITTLE BOY's daddy only survives WWII because of the A-Bombs. LITTLE BOY's implicit argument is that America has lost Her way since 1945, and MUST revert to nuclear Revenge & Deterrence forays into world trouble spots such as Iran, Russia, North Korea, and China to regain Her stature as God's Annointed Holy Nation. The rest of this movie is carefully constructed to teach LEGAL immigrants about the proper way to live in America. Mr. Yashimoto is NOT accepted until ALL of his cultural keepsakes (and traditions) are stomped to bits in the dust. LITTLE BOY is yelling to the barrio, ""Forget May 5, Quincineras, and pi√±atas--gorge on Fourth of July hot dogs instead!"
"peterp-450-298716","8","3","5","1 September 2015"," I'm not a fan of tear jerking, corny movies, but this one caught my attention from the first minute.
","""Are you saying I should stop? I would say do what makes sense for you.""<br/><br/>""Little Boy"" is about a strong father-son relation, faith, hope, love and trust. And all this with the help of a mustard seed and an illustrious magician out of a comic strip. Oops, faith and a parable about a mustard seed. You immediately expect it to be a slightly religious movie with the Christian theme about faith as a central topic. Ultimately, this isn't entirely the case. At some point it even appeared as if the savvy Pepper (Jakob Salvati) succeeded in surprising the officiating priest with his astounding, logical and unrestrained questions. ""Why wouldn't God want to bring my dad back ?"", he asks innocently. The underlying message in this beautiful and moving film is indeed imbued with a message from the holy book, but ultimately it isn't really that preachy. Let's just say that if you believe in something, you can reach your goal. You could even move mountains. ""Do you believe we can do this? Yes, I believe we can do this "".<br/><br/>Pepper Busbee is a roguishly looking kid who's very small for his age (but not a ""midget""). That's why he's being bullied by the bigger boys who live in the fictional coastal town O'Hare. A town you also can admire on postcards, as pointed out by the voice-over of Pepper personally at the beginning. Pepper's best friend and partner is his father James Busbee (Michael Rapaport) who shares Pepper's enthusiasm for comics and cinema films. Until the day comes when James has to go to the front, because the eldest son London (David Henrie) is rejected by the army due to flat feet. Pepper's world collapses and he believes that he could bring his father back home by sheer force.<br/><br/>Personally I'm not a big fan of sentimental, tear jerking films, with moral and Christian values . But this 105 minutes long film kept me in its grasp from the first minute. It reminded me a bit of ""Forrest Gump"" which is also situated in this period, America during World War II with its homely and Christian values, and with a main character who succeeded in accomplishing something simply by perseverance and believe. As antithesis of this pious values, some inferior qualities (racism and bullying) that sometimes emerge in a person, are being used. The son of the local doctor, Dr. Fox (a funny rendition by Kevin James) who does a follow-up on Pepper's condition and tries to get in the favor of Pepper's mother Emma (Emily Watson), takes care of the bullying part. The racism against Asian civilians is nourished by the attack on Pearl Harbor, after which Japanese citizens were accommodated in camps. The target here is the returned resident Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who's constantly being threatened by both London and a fellow townsman (Ted ""The Silence of the Lambs"" Levine), whose son was killed during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Even Pepper is sucked into this spiral of hatred.<br/><br/>To steer everything in the right direction, the priest Oliver (Tom Wilkinson) shows up and tries to explain to Pepper the meaning of Matthew 17:20 ""Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move"". And to strengthen his faith, he hands Pepper a to-do list with a few assignments, including the difficult task of befriending Hashimoto. First I must admit that I thought Wilkinson was a very amiable man of faith. The way he helps Pepper. He does that in a child-friendly, compassionate and somewhat playful way and not in a patronizing, intrusive and pedantic manner where contradiction isn't tolerated. Let's say that the ecclesiastical institution is presented in a very different way than it was during that time period (as I imagined it would be).<br/><br/>If you really don't like those sentimental, corny movies that'll make emotional people cry all the time, you'll probably ignore this one. But rest assured, there are also admirable, beautiful aspects in this film. The performances of Tagawa and Wilkinson are just plain fantastic. Both the Japanese citizen who resigns to one's fate and the at that time very modern Catholic priest. Both of them interpret their roles with bravura, although Tagawa seems like the teacher from ""The Karate Kid"" who stands up for the weak, little fellow. Salvati also delivers a magnificent performance, only it seemed sometimes as if it figuratively grew above his head during the deep emotional moments. And his grimaces and theatrical facial expressions during his attempts to evoke telekinetic powers, looked rather funny after a while. And that his name was associated with the most destructive weapon of WWII, actually caused a nasty aftertaste. But besides that, this film told a story of everlasting hope and confidence and still succeeded to fascinate me. A movie with a smile and a tear.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

There were so many positives in this film, that it is almost difficult to identify them individually. <br/><br/>The story was excellent with a perfect plot, holding just the right amount of surprises. It held an air of realism, including fair treatment of faith, racism, and bigotry, resulting in a realistic characterization of love and hate. All was treated honestly and reflectively. <br/><br/>The film was an honest characterization of a family during World War II, named for a little boy who worshiped his dad. His innocence, coupled with determination stole your heart. In fact, all of the characters were excellently portrayed. They were not only believable but completely likable.<br/><br/>The film took place during the second World War, using flashbacks between the family home and the battlefield.

There are very few books/ movies in which you find yourself identifying with a more sinister character in the plot (in my case, London - the angry and vexed teenager, struggling to choose a battleground to express or extinguish his bitterness). I had not expected to mirror myself on such a character, testament to the solid acting of each performer.

Little Boy wants faith great enough to move mountains and bring his dad back from war. Father Oliver, played by Tom Wilkinson, gives him an ancient list and tells him, if he does all the things on the list, it will help grow his faith bigger. The list is the corporal works of mercy. Father Oliver adds one more: Little Boy must befriend Hashimoto. It is a heart warming and poignant story with many layers of meaning, beautifully filmed. It does look like Norman Rockwell on film. An amazing performance by Jakob Salvati, who plays Little Boy. How the director, Alejandro Monteverde, pulled such a performance out of a young child is truly remarkable.

","""Do you believe you can do this?""<br/><br/>Little Boy is a family friendly faith-based film, and that usually means it's going to be overly sentimental and manipulative, which proved to be the case once again here. These films aim so hard at being inspirational, that they end up accomplishing the opposite. Alejandro Monteverde's film is completely generic and it follows the same beats other movies in this genre tend to hit. From the overbearing narrative which spells out everything that you are about to see and allows you to see the twists coming a mile away, to the cute child actor performance who is impossible not to sympathize with, and the overly heavy handed preachy message that is repeated throughout the movie. Non-demanding audiences who simply want to have a good time with their families will enjoy this because it looks nice, but there is no substance to it and the formula is repeated once again. I didn't feel uplifted or inspired by its message because it lacked originality. The film forces you to feel a certain way about each character instead of allowing you to make up your own mind about them. It's a shame because the cinematography was solid and there were some great actors involved, but the producers played it safe and gave us a generic film which will easily be forgotten. If you want to inspire and move your audience, then actually try being inventive and taking risks instead of centering on an overly melodramatic premise. <br/><br/>The story take place during the Second World War in a beautiful California town. It is narrated by the protagonist who recalls his life during that troublesome period as an 8 year old boy who due to his short height had to deal with the bullying and teasing from other kids his age. Pepper Flynt (Jakob Salvati), who the people in town call Little Boy, has a solid relationship with his father, James (Michael Rapaport). He can ignore all the bullying when he is surrounded by his father's love and devotion. His mother Emma (Emily Watson) and his older brother London (David Henrie) are all fond of him, but he adores his father above all. Things take a sharp turn for Pepper when James is sent to War and he is left on his own waiting for his father's return. He is touched by a sermon given by Fr. Oliver (Tom Wilkinson) about the power of faith and how someone with faith the size of a small mustard seed can move a mountain. He and his dad were fans of a comic magician named Ben Eagle (Ben Chaplin) and when he comes to town during a performance, Pepper is invited on the stage as a volunteer and performs a magic trick which convinces him he too has special powers. Confused by this event and Oliver's message, he puts his faith on his father's return. Oliver gives him a list of things he must do (feed the hungry, visit the prisoners, clothe the naked, and so on) if he wants his faith to work. At the end of the list Oliver adds one last thing: befriend a Japanese. This because after the Pearl Harbor incident everyone in town was verbally assaulting a Japanese immigrant named Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), including Pepper who was relieved to see some of the bullying heading another direction. The film then centers on this odd pairing between the two and after a series of coincidences and random events Pepper begins to truly believe he has the necessary faith to bring his father back home. But has Oliver gone too far by making him such a promise and giving Pepper so much hope? If the film would've cared to explore that question in more depth, we could've had something interesting, but instead it settles for the easy way out. <br/><br/>Despite all the familiar themes this inspirational film tackles, I did have a major problem with its message. The way it handles faith and compares it to something like magic is troublesome. This film tries to do what most religions do, which is tell us that faith has to do with how well we perform. In other words, you need to do a certain thing or follow certain rules if you want faith to work. Which is basically saying that it is all about you and how you perform. I don't agree at all with that view about faith and find it extremely problematic considering the film is geared towards a faith-based audience. However, I never judge a film for its message so that is not why I'm criticizing the movie. Its fault relies on its generic style and melodramatic storytelling. Talented actors such as Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson are given nothing to do, and even Kevin James is inexplicably in this film playing a role that could have easily been cut out of the film. Jakob Salvati as the lead delivers in charm and sweetness, but we are forced to sympathize with him and that didn't allow me to enjoy his performance. Little Boy is overly sentimental and that is its greatest fault, but I guess that is what one would expect from family friendly films like this that try too hard to inspire its audience. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"pennyelenabooks","4","4","9","20 September 2015"," Good enough
","A boy, wanting to bring his father back from war, is willing to do anything to stop the war. Like every other family movie before it, ""Little boy"" focuses on the life of a boy that has to overcome some obstacles but still believing in magic and faith that will both help him achieve the impossible. And like every other family movie it focuses on love and friendship. There are some original points in the movie though that can turn it to become entertaining and interesting. The performances are good as well, with the shots of the scenery to add flavour to the whole atmosphere of the film. With the two worlds colliding into a moving story about love between a boy and his father, Little boy couldn't escape the clich√©s of the ending, as it had to be a happy end. So 4 out of 10."
"ette","4","5","13","11 April 2016"," Bad taste...
","So, this is a ""cute"" story about a little boy who's determined to do what may be needed to bring his father back from the war. He hears in church that even a mustard seed-sized faith may make you capable of moving mountains, and he takes it literally (and he proved he was somehow capable of it...). A priest gives him a list of ""tasks"" which are required of him to bring his father back (but only if it's God's will, the priest says). Apparently, the intention of the priest was to stimulate the boy to be sympathetic to other people's suffering, but the boy takes everything literally. Overall, it's a ""cute"" story, apart from the explanation of the boy's nickname (and the title of the movie...) ""Little boy"" came out to be the name of the bomb which the Americans dropped over Hiroshima!!!!! So, in a way, the ""little boy"" was responsible for the end of the war, and this was the most celebrated fact in the whole movie... Are you kidding me?? Do anyone think this is cute or something like it? A bomb over Hiroshima?? For me, this ""little boy"" link demonstrated an extremely bad taste! I could have scored the movie as 7, but after that, 4 was my score. It was horrible!"

","I saw it, and I liked it. It is such a good family film with high production values. It is mainly about a child, albeit small for his age, who showed to other people what determinism - or in a more religious perspective, faith - is all about. Sounds clich√© and predictable, but what makes this film good is how it was told through a little boy, through his innocence and simplicity. Indeed, much can be learned from a child, despite the character's shortcomings for just being an ordinary boy in the neighborhood. The little boy was bullied for being 'little', and he cannot be even considered smart for his age. The setting was World War II, the time when able-bodied men were sent to war in the Far East. The boy has an older brother who satisfied the age requirement, but wasn't able to make it for being flat-footed. So their father was sent instead, and this was heartbreaking to the little boy.<br/><br/>There was hatred of the Japanese almost everywhere, and well, predictable enough, there was a Japanese living in their village who have sided with the Americans. The vengeance for their father was directed to this Japanese, which lead the brothers in committing a crime. The older brother was imprisoned and being a religious family, the little boy had to serve penance for the delinquency that he has committed. From this part, everything almost revolves around a list and the determination to fulfill what was on the list. The good thing is that this was well-acted and well-directed. If there is something to dislike, then some would probably believe that it is the contrived plot marked with a lot of coincidences. For me, however, these coincidences are pleasant contrivances in a sense that they are used to illustrate something valuable in our humanity. The illustration was compelling in a sense that it was used in context with the innocence of the boy. This made things amusing because the coincidences made him believe in himself for having extraordinary powers. Perhaps the village people are foolish enough for crediting the little boy for the atomic bomb. However, it can also be viewed as words of encouragement to the little boy and a celebration of the coincidence amidst depressing times. There is a lot of humanity in this film. If you believe in a supreme being, you will see faith, and if you do not, you will see determination. The turn of the story at the end can be considered clich√©, but then by that time the film had successfully made its point already.<br/><br/>P.S. I also think that this is one of the most underrated films that I have ever seen."

","When I told my wife we had the DVD of ""Little Boy"" from the public library she asked, ""Wasn't that the name of one of the bombs dropped on Japan?"" I said yes but this movie is not about that. Well, maybe it is.<br/><br/>Set in the 1940s California, in a fictional coastal village called O'Hare, Michael Rapaport is the dad, James Busbee, and he has a very close relationship with his young son, Jakob Salvati as Pepper Flynt Busbee. He is small for his age and the local kids are mean, they usually call him ""Midget"" but after the local physician suggests it, he takes on the name ""Little Boy"". <br/><br/>After Pearl Harbor there is a rush for young men to sign up and fight for the USA. The older son, maybe 18 or 19, has flat feet so is rejected and dad signs up in his place. Staying at home is the good mom, Emily Watson as Emma Busbee.<br/><br/>There is also a side story of acceptance, as a local Japanese man, an American citizen who had been there over 40 years, is hassled by the local men because he is Japanese. <br/><br/>This is a ""faith"" story, the young actor is actually the son of a Minister. Some viewers who adamantly detest faith-based movies will object to this one. But it is a very nice story of a young buy having faith that he can get God to help him get his dad back alive and well from the war.<br/><br/>My wife and I enjoyed the movie, very worthwhile.<br/><br/>SPOILER: The boy talks to the Parish Priest who gives him an old card that lists the works of mercy, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, etc. and tells him many believe doing these works will answer his prayers. Little Boy goes about finding ways to do those things. He gets picked at a magic show and told to make a bottle move. He glares and grunts, hands extended, and the bottle moves. Of course it is a trick but Little Boy has faith. He learns the story of the mustard seed, and on a dare he tries to move a mountain just outside town. The ground begins to shake, is it a coincidence, an earthquake that would have happened anyway? Or did his faith move the mountain? Then the Japanese man shows him on a map where Japan is, tells him at sunset (5:15PM) it is across the water where the sun sets. So Little Boy extends his hands and hopes to free his dad. Newspaper headlines the next day show that Little Boy (the bomb) was dropped on Japan, the war was about over. Was it faith or coincidence? His dad, first thought to have been killed, does come home and seems will recover."

Without saying why the following movies were my favorites, they were Of Mice and Men (the original, 1939 version) when I was a child. It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World replaced it in 1963. In 1978, before It's a Wonderful Life became a Christmas Classic, I happened to view it sometime in the Summer that year and it became my favorite. Then, in 1986 I saw the 1961 film Whistle Down the Wind which became my new favorite until Pay It Forward came along. Now, I am delighted to say that this wonderful movie about faith, love, and many other important elements of life embodied by Little Boy makes it my new number 1 movie. My favorite. The acting was superb, the direction and writing were top notch and deserving of Oscar consideration. I pray that happens and Little Boy comes out on top. Go out and get this movie and buy extra copies for your friends and loved ones this Christmas. They will be thanking you for such a wonderful gift.

","Little Boy is a film I had briefly heard about garnering acclaim for some time and so, I decided to place myself in front of a home screening of it. What I experienced as a viewer was nothing I was prepared for because the beginning made me unsure if I should have continued, but by the end I realized I had just viewed a family movie gem.<br/><br/>We're taken back to the past around the period of World War II in a small town in California with a conspicuous mountain at the end of it. After bonding greatly with his father James Busbee, Pepper¬† (Little Boy) has to watch his dad leave for the military in place of his ineligible older brother London. From here the biggest question looms over the Busbee family regarding whether if and when James would return from his service, causing internal family issues. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is solid and remarkably brings forth the emotions out of you as you watch and relate to the depicted situations. Jakob Salvati in the lead truly takes the ball and runs with it, amazing the audience with his presence and charm playing the bullied outcast boy with a strong interest in magic and wonder.<br/><br/>Faith, will and rising above discrimination are focuses that are at the helm of this movie. It explores good deeds and how its karma can result in a higher power granting us favors in return. It shows that if you want to accomplish anything, all you have to do is believe and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It teaches viewers the feeling of being discriminated against and how right it is for us to just love one another equally no matter what race we are from. This entire motion picture is a heavy and effective inspirational dose altogether.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the film I love is the firm direction and smooth cinematography.¬†¬† The whole production came off heartwarming and charming at times before being tension-filled and emotional. <br/><br/>Little Boy turned out to be a fantastic movie that I'll definitely be watching more than once. It's the kind of movie that leaves you thinking while it leaves you inspired by what you've seen. If there is one movie to recommend this year, I'd say go watch Little Boy right away. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

My kids and wife were bored and a little disturbed. While it might be historically accurate - in attitudes and behaviours - we were all uncomfortable with the racist, bigoted, hate that permeated the characters. And at no point was there a token character to point out how times have changed, how we now consider such attitudes unacceptable, how antisocial and ignorant behaviour should not be tolerated, etc...<br/><br/>I'm sure that some well educated youngsters, and many older people, can discuss how wrong and backward were the attitudes of *those* days, but my kids were watching bullying, racism, and general bigotry as though its an acceptable way of life.

LITTLE BOY is beautifully crafted, shot and edited. Director, Alejandro Monteverde not only had a deft touch with his actor's performances but created a seamless and creative film resulting in a true modern classic style that hasn't been seen in a very long time. Positive message films at this level of quality are far too few and rare. Eduardo Verastegui has an incredible steal and tenacity. His heart and passion to bring films like BELLA and now LITTLE BOY to audiences is exemplary and admirable to say the least.

","Others have recounted well enough the story line here so I won't bored you with that. In broad strokes, with a lot of talented and well- known actors newcomer Jakob Salvati steals the show and carries the film. That's taking nothing away from the other performances of which Tom Wilkinson's nicely underplayed priest and mom played by Emma Watson. Lot of small roles by well know actors, (Ted Levine a personal favorite and with a nice performance here.) Not at all preachy or tied up with a neat little resolution at the end as many of these faith-based movies can be. It's also not a fantasy which is what I thought from the trailers: the value of faith as process or journey verse believing and seeing miracle outcomes. Can be a bit overly sentimental at times but not out of line for the gravity of its subject. I enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a couple good cries. It's hard to be lured away from where a movie like this usually goes but it was able to do so with me. I couldn't project the end and having seen as many movies as I have that's not easy to do.

","I have a bachelor's degree in filmmaking, and I'm a published film critic (mainly in my college years but have since gotten a real job). <br/><br/>Little Boy is one of the most well-crafted films I have seen this year. The cinematography is outstanding. The acting is top notch -- and the young boy in particular is very talented, a natural. The cast is full of some of the best character actors in Hollywood. <br/><br/>The narrative is well-written -- it is multi-layered with complex, dynamic characters. The narrative pulls at the heart strings in ways that are not felt to be manipulative and inauthentic; rather, the powerful emotional pay-off of the film's narrative arc is hard won through good storytelling. The narrative also works very well, at a different level of analysis, as an allegory where the young boy is seen to represent the United States itself. <br/><br/>The editing is also impressive. Parallel editing between scenes, while not exactly a novel device since at least The Godfather, the device is very effectively utilized in ways that convey much more meaning that if the scenes had not been inter-spliced together. <br/><br/>This is almost perfect gem of a film. <br/><br/>There is only one reason why critics have been hard on this film, and that is due to the explicitly Christian, and especially Catholic, themes of the film. There is an obvious prejudice against the film merely due to the fact that it has religious themes.

As WWII reaches it's apex, Pepper's gung ho, flatfooted, older brother is denied military service forcing the Dad to fight instead. Pepper is heartbroken when his Dad leaves for the Pacific and the rest of the movie focuses on Pepper's enduring will to see his beloved Father again. <br/><br/>""Do you believe you can do this?""<br/><br/>Faith is at the center of the plot and is intricately woven throughout a metaphorical story line rich in morality, family, fantasy, chance, racism, friendship, death, love and fate. A continuing ideological dichotomy between a Priest and a Japanese internment prisoner (whom Pepper befriends) helps solidify the moral fabric of the film's message. Metatheatrical techniques are also used by way of a magic show and a story of a boy Samurai to help emphasize Pepper's ability to believe in himself and ultimately face his fears.<br/><br/>""I would say do what makes sense for you.""<br/><br/>Little Boy is not preachy like many critics claim it to be. There's a perfect balance between the belief in God and the belief in oneself conveyed in a way that really gets you thinking as an extraordinary and spiritual individual. Aren't we all just trying to make sense in our own unique world?<br/><br/>""You did it Little Boy!""<br/><br/>Thank you for giving me something to share and write about. Clearly a lot of heart and thought went into the making of this film and it deserves both recognition and praise <br/><br/>""...or so I thought."""

I felt like I was stepping into that era. Beautifully done. A wonderful family movie - it's inspiring! Little Boy will have you captivated and sitting on the edge of your seat! God bless everyone involved and thank you for making such a wonder-filled movie."
"donnacruise","10","1","2","5 February 2016"," An excellent movie with meaning
","Excellent movie, very moving. The aftermath scenes after Hiroshima were very intense. I was reminded of a high school senior term paper I wrote when 16 years old, back in 1963. The topic was, ""Was the U. S. justified in dropping the bombs on Japan in 1945?"" I researched everything our library had on the subject and wrote what I believe was an excellent paper. My conclusion was that it was indeed justified by the estimated saving of perhaps as many as 5,000,000 lives by not having to invade Japan. My English teacher was young and very liberal, and did not like my decision on the bombs. After an argument ensued between the teacher and me, I was given a ""C"" grade. Many thanks to Roma Downey and Mark Burnett for making this film. Much praise is also due to the writers of the script. The scenery was fantastic, and I was surprised to find out where it took place. I will leave it to the readers of this review to search for the location. IMDb always includes the filming locations - just keep scrolling down on the movie's page and you will find it."

","A must see movie if you love wholesome content, inspiring messages, great performances delivered by actors and appealing cinematography. I absolutely loved this film on so many levels. I wasn't the least bit surprised that the New York Times and Washington Post literally poked fun at it, as the message of faith is rarely embraced by mainstream media. But, don't let that stop you from giving this film a chance. I sat and watched it by myself, just looking for something heart warming before bedtime. I got so much more. Cried like a baby and slept like one too. This is truly one of the best films I have seen in a very, very long time.

"Reno-Rangan","8","1","2","4 November 2015"," Wars are the scars in the human history.
","I was two minded after seeing its trailer. Because I'm pretty much convinced it is a B movie. But that's not the issue, I usually put my faith on them and take my chances. So what bothered me was the film contents, because the trailed roughly reveals what kind of movie it is, from that I reckoned it should have been a big production house's product. Hence, I believed the visuals could be disastrous, but that was not the case. In fact, it was a remarkable standard, one of the reasons for the movie's success, despite there are no list-A actors in the full fledged roles.<br/><br/>The boy was much better in the movie than I judged his performance in the trailer. He might have appeared in a few television episodes, but this was his silver-screen debut. A wonderful display and I believe he would bag more projects for this. It was a family film, an emotional drama set during the United States entry into the World War II. Takes place in a small western coastal town called O'Hare about a 7 year old boy Pepper, nicknamed Little Boy who's willing to do anything to bring back his father alive from the war. On the effort he takes up a series of task which later stuns his town and the whole country.<br/><br/>""Do you believe you can do this?""<br/><br/>The Fascinating thing was, the blend between the real occurrence with the fictitious attachment. People might believe it was based on the real, but it is not. Like I said the graphics were very crucial that matched to any big budget films, unfortunately it was a small portion, but definitely a big deal. It talks about lots of interesting stuff which is inspiring, partially funny and also a children friendly film. Especially it explains quite clearly the difference between religious beliefs and magics which is obviously little kids never understood. So it could help to learn something from other than the textbooks.<br/><br/>The plus points were the consequences of war (any war), how the people can get affected by the war, bullying, racism and misbelief. On the other hand the minus was too much ingredient in a little movie, fortunately clicked so well. As usual, it was knocked down by the critics who never recognised the art of sentimental works. If you are not one of them or their followers, you are going to enjoy it.<br/><br/>If it had some big names in the main cast, especially for the father and brother characters, then it would have been roared louder and helped the international markets. As being one of the finest storied movie that highlighted our past mistakes, sadly terribly failed at the box office, but very much could get a cult status because particularly families loved this one so far. Not highly, but simply I recommend it and one of the must see from year 2015.<br/><br/>8/10"
"andrew-811-639783","10","1","2","11 August 2015"," Excellent actors, story, and message.. best film of 2015?
","I watched the movie without any expectations and was very pleasantly surprised from the first scene. It is beautifully shot, all of the actors are top notch, the story is really good, very believable, unpredictable, nothing like 99% of movies out there. No profanity or graphic violence, no sexual messages, just the reality of life... <br/><br/>It moved me back to the 1940's, and gave me a deeper understanding of American culture during that time. By the end, me and my wife were moved to tears... There were a couple of moments that were difficult or impossible to not respond to.<br/><br/>I thought Kingsmen may have been the best film I saw this year, but Little Boy probably beats it, although they are totally different genres. I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys real films, and anyone who is tired of shallow Hollywood garbage. Great picture all the way through."
"Seraphion","8","1","2","10 August 2015"," Very heartwarming and touching rich story
","At the time of World War II, James, a father of two from a small fishing town gets conscripted to fight the Japanese in the Pacific front after having his oldest son Landon denied enlisting in the Army for being flat footed. The younger little boy Pepper seems to be having symptoms of dwarfism and thus gets bullied by bigger kids, including Freedy, the son of Dr. Fox. Pepper is very close to James, who often takes him to see movies and shows of the magician Ben Eagle. In their town lives an old man of Japanese descent Hashimoto. People around town hates Hashimoto and considers him part of the enemy. Pepper's mother Emma gets news that James is being captured as a prisoner of war. One day Pepper gets selected as a volunteer to do Ben Eagle's trick of supposedly move a bottle telepathically. Landon and Pepper acts even further and vandalized Hashimoto's house, sending Landon to jail. Pepper gets sent to the local church where he meets Fr. Oliver who sees his innocence and gives Pepper a list of the works of mercy from Matthew 25:34-46, plus an addition of making friends with Hashimoto. Pepper goes to Hashimoto reluctantly. Hashimoto meets Fr. Oliver and gets explained about the priest's intentions. Pepper goes to see Landon in jail and strikes out ""Visit the imprisoned"" off the list. Soon Fr. Oliver goes on an assignment and Pepperis left without anyone to help him with his list.<br/><br/>One day Hashimoto helped Pepper escape from bullies. Feeling that he need to better his friendship with Hashimoto, Pepper visits him again and this time Hashimoto offers to help him on the list. With Hashimoto's help Pepper quickly strikes off ""Visit the sick"", ""Shelter the homeless"", and ""Clothe the naked"". One day Dr. Fox comes by the house offering sympathy and even helps Landon out of jail. Pepper complains to Hashimoto about being small. Hashimoto teaches Pepper to be brave and stand up for himself. For ""Feed the hungry"", Emma tells Pepper to invite a friend to eat, to which Pepper invites Hashimoto. But Landon gets angry and kicks him out. Sam, a local who lost his son at Pearl Harbor threatens Hashimoto to leave town. Landon catches up with Hashimoto and Pepper. He yells at Pepper and Pepper challenge his brother about having a faith that can move mountains. Landon stands Pepper up facing the mountain behind the town. As Pepper practices his faith, an earthquake takes place. This makes Pepper believe more in his faith's power and day after day practices on his father's picture and the door to bring him home. A letter comes informing Pepper that for his father to return, the war must first end.<br/><br/>Hashimoto tells Pepper where to point out but he also teaches him to do what makes sense to Pepper. Instead Pepper practices his faith pointing out to where the sun touches the water every after noon with the town watching. One day, the war ended after the bomb code-named ""Little Boy"" destroyed Hiroshima. But James hasn't come home yet. One night Sam and Landon vandalized Hashimoto's house, and Sam beats Hashimoto up. Landon stays put and gets sent to jail again. Hashimoto survives the ordeal and drops charges, freeing Landon. Emma receives news that James has been killed. The army tell Emma that James is buried in the Pgillipines but Emma holds a funeral ceremony anyway. Hashimoto strengthen Pepper that James' love is contained in the list. But One day an army officer comes and tell Emma that there was a mistake on James' name due to his dog tags got switched to another person, and that James is actually still alive. The family reunite at a hospital.<br/><br/>The story is very nice indeed. It's greatly a complete story; it tells us about the real animosity targeted at Japanese descent American during the World War II, but at another angle it also teaches about a kid's innocence and faith at it's fullest. The undertones are also strong; pitting faith against reason, and also giving example about faithfulness. It's not necessarily a Christian movie yet it's filled with great Christian values, without having to be instructional. <br/><br/>I like what the movie did repeatedly when it depicts Pepper's faith. The little boy's faith may start in the wrong way from believing in Ben Eagle's powers. But the movie shows that in faith it's not really how you have the faith that matters, but instead how you persevere and persist in practicing your faith and also accept that in the end it all comes back to the will of God. Also, the movie gets balanced enough by having the samurai values put in. But here, the movie wisely chooses the samurai value that doesn't contradict the Biblical value being emphasized. The value Hashimoto taught Pepper can also be seen in the Bible in the example of how David faces Goliath.<br/><br/>The acting overall is also a great job. Despite lacking a big name talents aside from the supporting roles by Kevin James and Tom Wilkinson, the movie can really rely on the niceties of its story and how the screenplay and directing job did to amaze. Jakob Salvati did a great job in acting his parts despite his age. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa delivered a very nice performance, carrying his menacing looks from his previous antagonist roles added with a depiction of a sense of wisdom from the East. Emily Watson, David Henrie and Michael Rapaport all provided the necessary angles for Pepper's family.<br/><br/>A score of 8 out of 10 is from me for Little Boy (2015), along with a definite recommendation to go see in the movies. Besides being very much heart-warming and touching, this movie can really be a definite family entertainment."

","An excellent film on many levels and worth seeing for several fine performances. However, it is Emily Watson as the mother who once again proves she is the finest actress of our time. She captures the humanity, warmth, and instincts of her character as the true master she is. It amounts to simply one more stunning performance of power and beauty. Watson has the incredible ability to communicate deep emotion with just a glance and her eyes say more than 50 pages of dialog. There is no denying she is a miraculously gifted actor and too often taken for granted because her quiet beauty and seductiveness is missed by today's cinematically illiterate audiences who wait for the next CGI effect. This is a film that is way over the heads of that crowd and Emily Watson's performance is wasted on them."

","Complimentary tissues should be distributed prior to viewing this film about a boy bringing his father home from war using the power of hope and faith. What could have easily been a preachy film, Little Boy is poignant and inspiring.<br/><br/>Pepper Busbee (Jakob Salvati) is a very small boy; at eight years old he is dwarfed by by all the other kids his age. Pepper's best friend is his father James (Michael Rapaport). The two are a close pair, and Pepper depends on his father for all of his emotional well-being. It's wartime, and James has been called to duty to the dismay of Pepper, his older brother London (David Henrie), and their mother Emma (Emily Watson). After Pepper ""moves"" a bottle at a magician's show with his mind, he comes to believe that he also possesses the power to bring his father home. He turns to a local priest, Father Oliver (Tom Wilkinson), who gives Pepper a list of charitable acts; Father Oliver then tells him that if he completes everything on the list then he can make anything happen. As part of the list, Father Oliver instructs Pepper to befriend a Mr. Hashimoto (Cary -Hiroyuki Tagawa), who was just released from a Japanese internment camp and is being discriminated against in the town. Pepper does so begrudgingly, but he soon finds that he has more in common with Mr. Hashimoto than he thinks.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro Monteverde perfectly captures the idyllic life of a small coastal Californian town during the 1940s. Everything and everyone looks straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting to almost a whimsical effect. Montaverde also composes some stunning shots of his lead actor, who is a strikingly beautiful child. Salvati does a wonderful job bringing Pepper to life, a performance reminiscent of Jackie Cooper in the classic King Vidor film The Champ. He is very talented, bringing sorrow to Pepper but also a lightness and quick sense of humor. Pepper represents the best things about being a child- he is hopeful, gullible, and his love for his father knows no bounds.<br/><br/>Some of the story techniques in Little Boy are old hat and cheesy; the voice over from ""old Pepper"" was completely unnecessary, and some of the flashes to James at war were also a little overkill. A dream that Pepper has about the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima was also a very stylized sequence we don't need to see, as it just reinforces facts the audience already knows.<br/><br/>There's a fine line between cheesy and heartwarming and Little Boy is wavering on both sides. Luckily for the film and the audience, it leans heavier on the heartwarming side.<br/><br/><ul><li>See more at: http://www.mediumraretv.org/review/little- boy/#sthash.50rSd6Ry.dpuf</li></ul>"

This film is a beautiful anti-racist film set during WWII written and produced by many Hispanics. It had many moral messages that all overlapped nicely but the most powerful one is 'Faith does not work if there is hate in ones heart'. I guess for most people they can't stand this message but it isn't surprising considering how racist our country is. My family and I loved this film and it brought us all to tears. I'm not religious but I find the dual respect for both types of viewers very respectful which is rare in film.

"CleveMan66","8","1","5","25 April 2015"," ""Little Boy"" features a big story and even bigger issues.
","Depicting faith as a major part of a film's plot is a tricky thing, as the many-faceted movie ""Little Boy"" (PG-13, 1:40) does. Children will almost always believe what authority figures tell them, whether right or wrong. After all, the vast majority of people all over the world are raised, live and die following the religion of those closest to them. It isn't hard to get a young person to believe, or to have, as the Bible calls it, ""the faith of a child."" This movie shows adults giving one child mixed signals about the importance and effectiveness of believing, but he goes with what a priest tells him. The priest seems to have trouble explaining the boy's confusion between a church sermon claiming that ""nothing is impossible"" for someone with faith ""as small as a mustard seed"" and the priest's statement that prayer changes things ""only if God wills it,"" yet, the boy believes his faith can do anything. That's the common thread running through this movie, but this is a wonderful story that's about a lot more than one theme.<br/><br/>The title character is a small 8-year-old boy named Pepper (Jakob Salvati), but others call him ""midget"", ""runt"", etc. because of his small stature. Eventually, the people of the (fictional) coastal town of O'Hare, California settle on the nickname ""Little Boy"", but Pepper has bigger problems than people picking on him and bullying him. His beloved father, James (Michael Rapaport), with whom Pepper has many imaginary adventures, has to go on a real-life adventure overseas to help fight World War II. Pepper's very upset that he can't join his ""one and only partner"" on this adventure, but the little boy has his loving mother, Emma (Emily Watson) and his caring, but hot-headed older brother, London (David Henrie), to look after him. Meanwhile, James finds himself fighting the Japanese in the Philippines.<br/><br/>Pepper grows obsessed with doing what he can to get his father back. After being called on stage at a magic show during which he ""makes"" a bottle move across a table, and then hearing a church sermon about faith accomplishing the impossible, he becomes convinced that he can basically will his father home. The local priest (Tom Wilkinson) tells Pepper that he can increase his faith by completing a list of good deeds which includes biblical admonitions to ""feed the hungry"", ""shelter the homeless"", ""visit the sick"", etc. And the priest adds ""Befriend Hashimoto"" to the list. Like Pepper, who is ostracized because of his height, Mr. Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) is also ""burdened"" with a physical characteristic that he cannot change. Hashimoto is treated very harshly by almost all the town's people because of his Japanese heritage.<br/><br/>Pepper follows the priest's instructions and Hashimoto helps Pepper complete his list, but asks the priest what will happen if ""your imaginary friend in the sky"" doesn't come through and Pepper's dad dies. As the main characters wrestle with whether to encourage Pepper's faith, discourage it or temper it, we occasionally get glimpses of what James is dealing with during the war and we hope almost as strongly as Pepper does that James gets home safely. The resolution to that situation is¬Ö very dramatic. (Sorry, but we're talking about military missions here. If I told you more, I'd have to kill you. Or you'd kill me for revealing a major plot point in this movie.) ""Little Boy"" is anything but a little story. Salvati, for example, is one huge talent, especially for his age. The script's ruminations on faith show both sides of the issue fairly (giving believers, non-believers and those in between all something to relate to), but also seem to be delivering mixed messages. This film's executive producers include Mark Burnett and Roma Downey, who also produced ""The Bible"" (the mini-series, not the book). If their objective was to show faith as real, then why show so much of what Pepper accomplishes as having naturalistic explanations? Then, of course, there's the backdrop for this story which is World War II ‚Äì one of the biggest stories in the history of mankind. (Besides being Pepper's nickname, the film's title refers to the codename of the atomic bomb that the U.S. dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, an event which led to the end of World War II in the Pacific Theater.) The movie's messages about faith may seem simplistic to some, but the film's depiction of war is realistic in its danger and complexity. And whether you find the portrayal of faith issues to be oversimplified and inconsistent, or right on the mark, the movie deserves credit for making such an important conversation a major part of a feature film ‚Äì and making us care so much about what it all means to one very special little boy.

","I found the movie to be nice. Yes, nice is the correct word. There's nothing profound here or earth shattering. It is a simple fantasy about the power of faith. It presents the world of a seven year old trying to deal with the complexities and horrors of the adult world. That world requires a lot of faith.<br/><br/>Jakob Salvati plays the role very well. His acting makes the film work. He is convincing as the little boy who believes anything is possible.<br/><br/>If you try to read more into this movie you'll miss out. The film is predictable. Fantasies are predictable in that the ending is always the same. But, I feel the movie was worth the 2 hours that I sat back and tuned into the little boy in me.<br/><br/>I give the film a seven. It is a beautiful production. The acting is competent though predictable. I give it higher marks because I needed something nice to divert my mind from the horrors that I see and read about everyday.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something more than the world of a seven year old this is not the movie for you."

","Many reviewers have expressed that the movie is an affirmation of their religious beliefs. Faith is indeed a dominant theme in this movie, and one of the central characters advocating faith is a friar. If one is so inclined (and so primed by the explicit talk about faith), one can see acts of god in this film, however, there is nothing so miraculous that an objective viewer need see that hand. If you believe that faith in oneself or in another (or perhaps hope, disguised as faith) can empower one through difficult times, then this movie will not disappoint.<br/><br/>The movie skillfully presents a wonderful, thoughtful, emotional, honest, religion-neutral story, that puts on display the best and worst sides of human nature, and in the end you and your kids will go home having seen the strength of the good."

","I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. It was a beautiful, educational movie on faith, the hard choices we have to make in life, and the opportunities we have to learn from our lack of faith. Little Boy exemplifies our readiness to give up, or blame others when events turn against us. In Matthew, of the Bible, we are told ""He called a little child and had him stand among them. And he said: ""I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Little Boy is that shining light of truly, blind faith that our Lord calls us too. This is a must see for young and old alike!

","I loved it for its beautiful message of hope. However, it is a tearjerker with witnessing racism and cruelty. Also disheartening to view a doctor's maneuvering the politics in a small town. The acting is not stellar but adequate. The cinematography is lovely and you get a real appreciation of a small coastal town in the 1940s. The length of the film was just about right. The historical references seemed to be correct. The representation of the era via clothing, cars, etc. was authentic and led you back into that time. However, I feel the little boy's haircut was not indicative of the era. I recommend it for anyone over the age of 10."
"andrew-14665","9","1","7","25 April 2015"," Well-written authentic story about an eight-year-old's tenacity
","It's easy to see how religious people take this for a religious movie, except in many ways it just isn't. It's really just about the little boy, Pepper Busbee, in a small coastal California town. He really is SHORT - like, pediatrician discussing possible dwarfism short - making him a target for bullies.<br/><br/>The little boy's fantasy life is authentically and brilliantly depicted in several sequences through the movie, not overly detailed nor overly stylized. The heroic comic-book magician ""Ben Eagle"" provides a running foil to the fantasy.<br/><br/>World War II removes his father, his partner in fantasy adventures and presumably a protector from bullies, leaving the little boy grieving and longing for his return. By chance Pepper glances up from his Ben Eagle comic to hear a sermon saying a mustard seed of faith can move mountains. He marches to the preacher to get an explanation so that he can 'move the mountain' of getting his dad back from war.<br/><br/>The dominant relationship is between Pepper and Hashimoto, a sixty-ish Japanese recently returned from internment. This is a key part of the ""assignment"" Pepper embraces to move the mountain, although it also includes a selection of the traditional ""Works of Mercy"" such as feeding the hungry.<br/><br/>At intervals we see the near-death hazards faced by Pepper's dad, like so many other Pacific theatre GI's, including time as a POW.<br/><br/>The kid's not complicated, he just wants the bullies to leave him alone and to have his dad back. Along the way he grows into a child with great character qualities.<br/><br/>The acting is very strong, except for the older brother ""London.""<br/><br/>The writing is very authentic.<br/><br/>The setting is hard for me to assess - the small town is intimate and somewhat catty, but in other ways pretty warm. <br/><br/>I loved this film."

","Most the individuals who liked the film made connotations to god, while some stated that it was christian fairyland propaganda and infantile. While it ostensibly was, this is the first old fashioned childish feel good film that I have seen that imparts a few socratic lines to prod some of the audience to question beliefs, miracles, etc.; unfortunately it seems as though that may have gone over the intended audience's heads due to their insular societal inculcated dogma - next time, try a 2 x 4. Obviously, different people - including family members - could/did watch it and come away with different thoughts about the movie as well the thoughts of those who watched it."
"bramble-67253","1","0","6","9 March 2019"," Anti-American Propaganda
","I watched this hoping it would be a warm, nostalgic depiction of 1940s America, only to find it was subtle Anti-American Propaganda, even Anti-Christian. Almost every American of European origin was depicted in a negative light, and Christianity depicted as having no answers, while the ""heroes"" were Third World immigrants, Japanese samurai and magicians pushing the occult message to children that they have ""special magical powers"", and don't need God. The other message to children is that it is OK to go into a strange man's home with him alone, and to cheat in a fight, by whacking your opponent with a metal lunchbox in the face, or shooting them with a poisoned dart. I hope people will wake up to the subversive propaganda often presented in movies."

","Little Boy has all the hallmarks of a bad Christian film. Namely, racism, bigotry, intolerance, and in this case, the deaths of 200,000 Japanese civilians all brushed aside with the flimsy ""It's ok because it's FOR JESUS"" excuse. Oh, and Paul Blart is there for some reason too..."
"queenofhairspray","1","0","2","8 May 2018"," Unrealistic, and ignorant
","The entire film is a little boy trying to use telekinesis to bring his father home from war... yes seriously. 
 While the movie is one of those 'Christian' productions about faith, it's like the film equivalent of a watery chicken soup coated in buttercream frosting; it's supposed to be good for you, but it's cheaply made and coated in so much sweet stuff that it's hard to finish and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Also, it is completely unrealistic and misleading; God is not a genie in a bottle who grants wishes, and having faith doesn't get you everything you want. 
 
If all that doesn't bother you, watching a small child use racial slurs for an hour and a half probably will. As stated by other reviewers, not one adult (not even the priest trying to help the boy) tell him that referring to anyone as JAP isn't a very Christian thing to do. (never mind the disrespecting of his elders) Especially when said little boy is being bullied and called names himself throughout the entire film. (dwarf, midgit etc.). <br/><br/>And if THAT doesn't set off your alarm bells then the fact that this film (and the title character) are NAMED after the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima should; 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured to varying degrees. Of those deaths, ONLY 20,000 were members of the Imperial Japanese Army.
Not cute, not a wholesome or realistic story, and not worth the time."

","Quite a surprising film, i figured out the ending half way through the movie. They don't really make movies like this any more, like a painted canvas that tells a story, where you see something new each time you look at it. It also has layered all sorts of themes and story. Very much like literature, ""the godfather"" was like that. This movie had some cgi in it but it was used to push the narrative forward not the narrative itself. Reminds me of the movie from the 30s to the early 60s. Where the film just told a story usually about the human condition. No car crashes, zombies, capes etc..i used to walk out of the theatre back then and wonder that film was just about a man and woman talking ala ""of human bondage"",vertigo. It takes a lot of work to keep ones attention to keep watching when it is only a snapshot in the life of a little boy during wartime. There was paper towel times, i came away grateful that the world has more or less been in peace for this long period. Better then rom-com regardless of the ending much of the had sadness and reluctant hopefulness. Good movie."

This made the movie, much easier to grasp, because, it's relatable. <br/><br/>The acting of the characters were amazing.

"sfcespo","10","0","5","12 May 2015"," ""Little Boy"" is truly ""a modern classic""
","""Little Boy"" is a great movie that is actually very diverse in subject matter and theme. This wonderful film actually takes on several and various social topics and it is not afraid to address them. Bullying, racism and war are among those. But overall, this is a great ""father/son"" family film as well, that displays a father's love for his family and his son's love for his father and family.<br/><br/>There is a lot of hope and optimism conveyed throughout this film and the subject of ""doing the right thing"" is also realistically portrayed as being both challenging and rewarding. The ""7 acts of kindness,"" also know as ""works of mercy,"" are depicted in this film and many Catholics would recognize these works. Those who represent the Catholic Church (priests), are actually shown in a positive light for a change. This film contains action, humor, drama and some ""imaginative and fantasy"" type sequences thrown in, which really do support this movie's plot. <br/><br/>""Little Boy"" is actually for the most part a lot of fun to watch as well. It's hard to imagine a film that deals with such serious topics and ""hard times"" as being fun, but overall the film is very enjoyable for the entire family. It is rated PG-13 probably because of the subject matter of war and the occasional violence or ""threat of violence"" depicted in a few scenes with local ""townsfolk"". <br/><br/>The cast is a great one and the acting is very believable and realistic. The cinematography is beautiful, the sets, clothing and automobiles are authentic and the soundtrack is very good. The overall production and direction of the film is impeccable and just awesome to watch. <br/><br/>Also, comic book fans, (and this hasn't been bought up in the other reviews that I have read) especially Golden Age Comic fans should see this film as it ""authentically"" shows how much an important part of our ""pop culture"" these were during the WWII era.<br/><br/>Obviously ""Little Boy"" will appeal to Roman Catholics and others of the Judeo/Christian faiths. But really, I believe that this film would appeal to anyone who seeks a good quality film that's not afraid to tackle serious issues with an overall positive message. Therefore this film, I believe, would appeal to those of many different faiths as well and I agree with Cal Thomas who wrote that, ""Little Boy"",""could be a modern classic"". I believe that it is ""a modern classic"" and that there are so few recent films that could be considered as such. So, my recommendation for you is to ""annoy the critics"" and go see this film that has a happy ending for a change, as it is a very refreshing and a very rewarding film to watch. Thank you for reading this."

Although it specifically will appeal to baby boomers, its overall appeal should be relevant to everyone. Children may need a little history on WW2 before seeing it, but the theme is universal.<br/><br/>It's a period piece, so that there are no African Americans is somewhat understandable, and one wonders why the single Japanese resident chooses to stay in O'Hare, but the main message transcends all time.<br/><br/>I hadn't done much research on this film in advance and was pleasantly surprised. ""Shocked"" might even be appropriate to describe my reaction when I saw that it is a Roma Downey/Mark Burnett film. It is not preachy at all.<br/><br/>I think I would have preferred a different actor than Kevin James (too familiar) in the role of Dr. Fox, but he provided levity along with MANY other moments in the film, which is part of what makes it so unique and special.

I really disagree with the negative ratings by the critics as they are rating the movie based on their personal beliefs and not with an objective perspective. They seem to be annoyed by the fact that the movie is taking place in California in the 1940's when Catholicism was a very common religion among the citizens and the movie portrays the fact. But they seem to feel ""bombarded"" by the religious themes in the movie which do not adhere to their modern lifestyle.

"wpalcher","8","0","4","28 April 2015"," A wonderful story about people I could care about
","My husband and I both enjoyed this movie about a little boy named Pepper who desperately wants to do something to help his father come home safely from WWII. He has a fascination with magic. Can magic bring his father home? He's been told by a kind pastor that faith the size of a tiny mustard seed is strong enough to move a mountain. How can he have that kind of faith and use it to bring his father home? <br/><br/>One can almost see the boy's struggle with understanding the difference between the two--magic and faith. The pastor's hands-on way to help him build his faith, a list of the corporal acts of mercy, gives him a way to start where he is with his fascination with magic and build his spiritual muscles, so to speak, to become a more compassionate and faith-filled child.<br/><br/>Like all movies, this one has a few flaws. I felt that the older brother's change of heart at one point was too abrupt and that Pepper's grunting attempts to harness the power of his mind and of his faith were a little overplayed. Nevertheless, the emotional impact of the film was intense, I cared what happened to the people in the story, and important, timely issues were treated without becoming preachy. Racial prejudice, bullying, and the impact of war on the participants and their families in particular, and all people in general--all of these issues were woven together to create an uplifting story that inspires the viewer to tend a personal mustard seed of faith and go out to move a mountain."

LITTLE BOY is a powerful and moving, utterly unique story that will capture your heart and inspire your faith. It tells the heartwarming story of a little boy who is willing to do whatever it takes to bring his dad home from World War II alive. Set in the 40's, Little Boy is a cinematic classic that captures the wonder of life, faith and struggles through the eyes of an 8-year-old boy. Central to the film's story line is ""The List"", a ""magical card"" a priest gives Little Boy to help him do good and increase his faith. The List is well known to many as the corporal works of mercy. Plan to take your entire family to see this film and spend time talking about the power of faith, of family, and the need for reconciliation in our selves, our families and our community. I was not expecting much more than a feel good movie, but was moved much more deeply throughout the entire film by the depth of the story line, the excellent acting and the engaging plot lines.

","I believe LITTLE BOY hits. I've seen it twice. Much enjoyed it both times. It doesn't back away from admitting that despite 'faith' of whatever type, there can come trying times in life, and seems to me to ask the audience to ponder if one needs help in such times, then where might one go for help in those times. Some people think they have the answers. Some humbly admit they not sure sometimes, leading to questions being asked about such. And WW2 as big an event as any for such pondering, I'd think.<br/><br/>The characters in LITTLE BOY do not all behave or think the same things, regarding how to act in trying times, or what to have faith in or why? <br/><br/>And I don't think it answers the question on 'faith' for the audience, it rather asks the question to the audience in some ways. Also a great reminder to me re: do I prejudge or bully? Think I am better for having seen this movie, and it was enjoyable to see too. <br/><br/>Very 'moving'.

","I loved this movie ! The casting of the actors for the characters was excellent ! Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Hashimoto) should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor ! The depth in the script for ""Hashimoto"" shows so many human emotions! His character faces racism and humiliation but he shows true strength to overcome peacefully. His character shows only kindness and love in the face of a time of discrimination to Japanese Americans during World War II. This movie is well written and has several subtle messages in it. Jakob Salvati (Little Boy) was excellent but I honestly feel that all the actors in this movie showed first rate acting in terms of showing emotion and depth of the characters. This movie is not just some movie on ""faith"" or ""religion"". This movie will make you laugh,cry and feel better that there is still some hope in this world ! I believe!"

","This film will capture your heart, if you allow it to! If you can remember being a child and can remember how you saw the world very differently from how you see it today as a adult, then you will understand the beauty behind this film. Of course, this little boy took literally what he was told. That he could bring home his father, if he believed! And so he believed and we wanted to believe too! Don't all of us want faith like a child? To believe in miracles, to believe in the possibility of love conquering all. So, go back to the good feel days of being a child and see this movie. It might change the way you see the world!"

","Words cannot express how much not only the US needs to see this movie but the WORLD. With so much going on in the world about hate, this movie truly captures what our society needs today. Its inspirational, young, fresh, and entertaining. I have read many ""Film Critics"" reviews on this movie and cannot believe the horrible words that I see. I think this movie is Oscar worthy and will hopefully bring joy to everyone that sees the true meaning on it. Thank you to the directors and producers for creating such a wonderful film!I highly recommend this movie to the entire family. Do not let the PG13 rating scare off the kiddos because I do not think this film should have been rated that high. Its perfect for everyone!"

","I saw the marvelous film ""Little Boy"" yesterday night with my friends. Moved me to the point to write my first movie review ever. English is not my first language, and often I refrain from writing fearing my lack of English skills. I live in San Diego California and must speak English with a heavy accent daily, and most people tolerate it, hence I venture to write with an ""accent"" now. The message of hope I felt last night with Little Boy is something I have been missing attending movies for a long time. From the costume design and the Norman Rockwellesque general mood, to the acting and dialogs my attention was kept throughout the movie with a very comfortable and pleasant feeling. I grew up catholic and still practice and felt very familiar with the message of ""grow your faith"" I sense in the movie. I wear a cross around my neck, a family heirloom, and for some reason, I was wearing a lapel pin on my jacket last night I got in Vatican City when I meet Saint John Paul II. You see, I am usually a bit ""strange"" for my coworkers, specially because of the milieu of my professional life. I am a fashion designer and often the ""Little Boy"" amount my colleagues. I am telling everybody I know that this movie is a ""must see"" my hope is that they will be moved to conquer their fears and move mountains through love, acceptance, tolerance and persistence. The way I see the world now, we need more of this kind of messages to permeate our surroundings and make us militants of hope. BRAVO."

","Little Boy Movie is finally a movie you can take the whole family to and not just be entertained, but actually connect with what'd going on. People will be able to relate at so many levels and generations. There is a God given authority to go beyond the magic, beyond denomination and to the heart. This movie takes real life situations from a child's perspective and brings it home even at the adult level. Well done ! Well written, well carried out and very timely. I would definitely see it again, suggest it to family and friends and it gives us so much more to talk about than the choice of one's outfit or color of hair. Real life conversations arise in amazing ways that speak of incredible hope that truly - we can Believe for what seems impossible. The mountains will move."
