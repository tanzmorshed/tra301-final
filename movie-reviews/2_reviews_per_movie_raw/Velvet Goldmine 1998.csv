","It is quite an extraordinary experience to sit through this film years after its controversial outing back in the distant 1998. Like many of the great pieces of art, or wine for that matter, time gives it that extra something that evolves its taste into something that you crave. The erotic innocence of the story is very much Oscar Wilde territory. Innocence, yes. - I've been arguing about it with some people about the inclusion of the word, if not the feeling, innocence in this context. I insist the word is perfectly fitting because at the end of this rainbow there is the longing for love. Ewan McGregor's cock is already famous the world over - and with reason - here it dangles across his frame like a child, unaware of his own nakedness. Jonathan Rhys Mayer is a delight. Strange to see him in feathers after ""Match Point"" and yet it makes a lot of sense. Christian Bale one day, will leave behind the pouting arrogance that is rapidly becoming his trademark - even as Batman - and come back to the glorious promise he insinuated here. All in all a triumph, Todd Haynes style."

","I don't think I've ever seen a movie that has polarized people as much as this one, or at least very few. Some people have put down every single thing about it. As for me, when my roommate (who had already seen it) asked me what I'd thought of it I replied in all honesty, ""I loved every single frame of it."" She concurred, and we've both seen it again since. I plan to buy it as soon as I can find it for sale. It's heavy on metaphors, which seems to have annoyed a lot of people. As for it's structural resemblance to 'Citizen Kane', that was one of the points. Glam rock was in part about copying others for copying's sake, like Brian Slade copied from Curt Wild, and everyone copied from Jack Fairy. The performances are all great. Some may nitpick about how the characters were portrayed, but I think they were all apt. Ewan McGregor has gotten plenty of slobbering, ecstatic praise from me in the past, and this only encouraged the worship. Toni Collette, so mired in ugly duckling roles since 'Muriel's Wedding', is wonderful, as is Christian Bale's brittle, disillusioned reporter role. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is, as Brian Slade, a glittering void, as cloaked in mystery at the end as he was at the beginning. Some of have criticized his role, but I think he did it just right, with a grand coldness. One believes that only such a creature could be the idol of an era that was, in the end, about glittering emotional voids and icy hipness. Why did he do what he did? We never know. That's one of the best parts. (I must embarrass myself here by noting, also, that Rhys-Meyers is so shockingly beautiful it's disgusting, like eating too much honey. Kinda makes you wanna puke on his shoes, doesn't it?) I suppose that not everyone can be expected to love this movie as much as I did, but I'm still a little surprised at some of the venom that's been spit at it. Then again, it is a truly enigmatic film, delicious for those who can appreciate a glorious feast of sight and sound, but just plain confusing and annoying for those who lack the imagination to appreciate it."
"Bifrostedflake","10","37","43","17 July 2008"," One of my favourite films of all time
","I almost didn't want to comment, because I simply cannot match some of the wonderfully eloquent things that have already been said about this film, however, because it is an all time favourite of mine, I simply cannot resist.<br/><br/>How anyone can not like this film is beyond me, I have read a lot of reviews of this film, both positive and negative and the negative points people have made I couldn't disagree more with. The film isn't about Iggy Pop and David Bowie, it isn't even about two gay men, its about two people who are falling in love at the most inopportune and exploitable moments of their lives.<br/><br/>The characters aren't just engaging, they are addictive, the plot isn't just compelling, it's spellbinding. The acting cannot be faulted, the casting is perfect and the soundtrack is one that I have barely gone a week without listening to in the last ten years.<br/><br/>After badgering him for the last five years or so, I finally convinced a friend to watch this film. At the end I asked him what he thought and he just looked quite pensive for a moment and then turned to me and said: I wish I had watched this film years ago when you first told me about it.<br/><br/>I don't allow myself to watch it often, even though I own 3 copies of it, I save it for special occasions when I want to be completely glued to my TV screen. If you have never seen the film, I urge you to watch it this minute and allow it to become deep-set in your heart. If you have seen the film and didn't find it as wonderful as I do, then I actually, genuinely feel physically sorry for you, that you are unable to enjoy this cinematic masterpiece."
"Ergodiel","10","73","93","5 December 1998"," Lovely, lovely lovely. And Jonathan Rhys-Meyers's just soooooooo beautiful
","This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I must admit the beginning confused me a bit, and the movie may have lacked in plot, but I just didn't notice, during the movie, I felt like I got sucked up within it, not like becoming one of the characters, but as if the cinema and the people within was gone and the only thing that existed was the movie - this only happens to me very,very rarely, I don't know if I've really been _that_ captured by a movie ever before - and it seemed the time that passed was at the same time very long and still just a few minutes. It felt somewhat like a very intense dream of sorts, and it lasted for the rest of the night once I got out of the cinema.<br/><br/>Indeed, these where fictional characters, like so many have pointed out before I did, even though based on real glam-rockers. However, I don't think that matters very much (although that may be because I wasn't there during the glam-era) it's a very good movie, it's artistic and the music is adorable (but I do think Bowie should have let them include at least the song Velvet Goldmine) so why bother about whether it's really real or fictional? Why not just enjoy it?<br/><br/>As for the Jack Fairy-character that some of you has wondered why he was there, I thought it was him who shot Maxwell... but as far as I'm concerned, he didn't have to do anything really, he was beautiful enough (not quite as marvellous as Jonathan's character Brian though) to have his existence in the movie justified anyway.<br/><br/>I rate this my fav movie right now, and everyone with an open mind should see it and for the rest of you lot, I just pity you that you can not see the beauty of this piece of art, because it really really is an utterly beautiful dream, I'd like to call it, once you let yourself fall into it and don't think of annoying unimportances (which I usually do while watching a movie, this one saved me from that, I guess I owe that to Todd and the talented, beautiful actors)."
"swinging_rose_hips","Null","153","207","5 October 2004"," Velvet Goldmine and Dorian Gray
","Even if I didn't think this movie was fantastic (which I do), I would have to be impressed with the incorporation of Oscar Wilde, his fascination with the decadence of pop culture, and his brilliant philosophies concerning art.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, when Arthur Stuart sits to have a drink with Curt Wylde (Oh look! A play on Oscar!, Wylde looks up and tells him that, ""The true artist creates beautiful things, and puts none of his own life into them"". This is one of the several scenes in which Oscar Wilde is referenced subtly, seamlessly and beautifully. <br/><br/>Curt is not simply Iggy Pop. He is Oscar Wilde. He is the true artist of the crowd, because he creates music without using the art as a form of autobiography. <br/><br/>Brian Slade is Dorian Gray. He invests all of his persona into the public, and into his songs, trapping himself in an expectation. The alter-ego Maxwell Demon is eternal youth. It is the embodiment of Slade in a single moment. Unfortunately, he traps himself, and leaves no room for growth. The shooting accomplishes two things. Slade arranging this pseudo-murder is Dorian gray destroying his portrait. At first Dorian was intrigued, even excited by the changes he saw in the painting. Then it began to wear on him. So with Slade/ Demon. The hoax liberates Slade the way death does Gray. Also, This secures Maxwell Demon a place in history. Brian Slade was a pop-star who was too controversial and too personally naked in his work to have any real longevity. The hype would have faded, and if he changed or grew as a person, that would have meant changing everything about his art (as they were so interlocked) and would have led to cries of ""sell out"". Either way, he would have faded out and been likely forgotten (the way Britney Spears will hopefully do one day). By enacting this faux death, Slade guarantees Maxwell Demon some form of eternal youth, trading in his career to do so (selling his soul). <br/><br/>There's more, as well. Jerry Devine, for instance, is Lord Henry. Mandy is Sybil Vane. They aren't exact, of course, and there are other veins running through them that make them unique, but one can see the influence.<br/><br/>Beautifully done, and a well paid tribute to the genius of Oscar Wilde!"

","i really enjoyed this movie.  the person who reviewed it so negatively seems to have missed the point.  yes, it is over the top, campy & sometimes corny. but come on!  you were expecting a restrained movie about david bowie and iggy pop?<br/><br/>i loved the camp, outfits, and excesses, and was unexpectedly moved by the story.  using a queer, ex-fan reporter to frame the movie--so as to emphasize the effect that this bi-positive bi-posing rock star had on queer kids, and how upsetting his betrayal of them was--worked brilliantly.  the use of arty-fairydust moments to capture the importance of fantasy to this scene worked wonderfully.  i really appreciated jack fairy, as a character and as a link from glitter to the drag scene--this is not usually acknoledged.  and whenever the movie veered too far into preciousness, the iggy pop/kurt wild character showed up to redeem it.  his origin story--18 months of electroshock after being caught having sex with a boy--was a much-needed dose of reality in the midst of the glitter.  and whenever the movie needed testosterone and directness, he appeared to supply it.<br/><br/>well, i think it's pretty clear that i'm the demographic for this movie--i'm the right age, i'm a fag, and i love both punk and glitter.  but my straight boyfriend adored it too.  if you ever enjoyed glitter or punk, keep an open mind & check it out, i think you'll like it.  even if you don't, you can always look at the pretty outfits."

","Slash Fanfiction is when a person writes a story involving two (usually) males characters from a television show or movie in a homoerotic romantic relationship. And this is what Velvet Goldmine is.  A visually stunning, incredibly tasty piece of slash fanfiction.  But instead of Kirk & Spock or Mulder & Krycek, it's someone who's a lot like David Bowie and someone who's a lot like Iggy Pop. Perhaps that appeals to you.  Perhaps it doesn't.  But despite its fanfiction feeling, this movie is absolutely visually stunning.  The imagery will last with you long after you leave the movie, your eyes blinking as you adjust to a rather grey drab world.  The movie isn't about substance, it's about style; about creating and rearranging yourself to fit the time, to fit the world around you.  It's about fluidity, fluidity of gender, personality, ideas, and romance. Because, like all Slash fanfiction, above everything else, it's a love story."

","I have to admit, the only reason I rented this movie was because of my current Ewan McGregor fixation--but I really hit a good one renting Velvet Goldmine. Being too young to have experienced the glam rock scene of the seventies and eighties and the roots of punk rock this movie not only gave me an awesome Ewan fix but a surreal, musically effulgent look at a time period that few got to experience first hand. Should you be a very straight forward and literal movie goer, I would not recommend this movie. But Velvet Goldmine kick a whole lot of ass for anyone who loves music, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Kurt Cobain and the pioneers of some of the greatest music to come out of the 20th century. Todd Haynes created a world of decadence, sexual experimentation glued together with infectious music and enough eye makeup to keep Christina Aguleria happy into her eighties. I highly recommend this movie to those with open minds and open ears."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","18","22","12 December 2008"," One day the whole stinking world would be theirs!
","It's 1984 and newspaper reporter Arthur Stuart is assigned to writing a piece about the disappearance of legendary Brit Glam Rocker, Brian Slade. Who after rising to the very top of the super stardom tree, chose to kill off his stage alter ego, Maxwell Demon, and subsequently killed off his career in the process. The Glam Rock era is one that Arthur knows well, in fact back at the time of the genre explosion he was very much on the scene, his life, Brian Slade's and wild American rocker, Curt Wild, are all linked by decadence and outrageous fulfilment!<br/><br/>There is no getting away from it, Velvet Goldmine divides film lovers across the spectrum, some folk are genuinely baffled by it, others (such as myself) think it's close to being genius, while some cinematic observers want to throw up at the mere mention of the film! I once engaged in a conversation with a fellow cinephile who positively hated the film with a passion, it was clear that we both watched a very different movie, nothing he said sounded remotely like the film I had watched and adored. Here I am after my third viewing thinking that I'm still right and that Velvet Goldmine demands repeat viewings to fully comprehend director Todd Haynes outlandish homages.<br/><br/>This is not remotely close to being a true story of the era, but it certainly has its finger on the pulse as regards how the genre evolved and lit up so many a dull dole day for many many people. Some instances and characters are based around factual things, I mean you would have to seriously know nothing about music to not see the David Bowie and Iggy Pop structured core on show here. But it's what Haynes surrounds these decadent icons with that really keeps you on your toes, when a film delivers the infant Oscar Wilde to a Victorian doorstep via an Unidentified Flying Object, then surely you know that all that is going to follow is not totally what it seems. Haynes sticks his tongue in his cheek and doffs his cap to Citizen Kane, cloaking it in a whirl of luscious identities and sexual explorations, the campy veneer lurching forward at every opportunity, with all of it strummed out to a soundtrack of glittering urgency.<br/><br/>It's a splendid cast list containing Ewan McGregor, Christian Bale, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Toni Collette, Eddie Izzard (of course), Michael Feast and Emily Woof, with Meyers outrageously believable and McGregor having the time of his life. But really it's the writing, the costumes and the art direction that glue it all together, Sandy Powell was rightly academy award nominated for her costumes whilst both Andrew Munro (art) and Todd Haynes (writer/director) can consider themselves astutely smart for knowing exactly how to make this picture work. 9.5/10"
"meusiclver","9","41","59","5 April 2005"," Beautifully crazy
","I love this movie because it is daring in content, partly non-fiction and partly fiction, delves into characters that would seem small or supporting, and it makes me want to wear glitter and find my sexy sassy side. Granted it will not be everyone's cup of tea, granted it's strange and dramatic, and granted it is sometimes assaulting to our senses. However, the cinematography is beautiful and memorable, the costumes are fantastic!, some of the acting is incredible, and the directing makes you feel like a stranger as well as an insider in the spectacular world of glam rock. It's worth watching just for the experience, even if you end up hating it. The first time I watched it I was thinking ""Okay, too much hype and too little point."" Isn't that sorta what glam rock's about though? Not entirely, obviously, but to some extent...yes. And the movie does start somewhere and end somewhere else. Several characters change drastically in the course of this film. DO NOT watch this film if you don't like films with homosexuality, drugs, nudity, or anything else interesting like that. DO watch it if you are interested in glam rock and interested in watching a film that is anything but conventional."
"Infofreak","Null","24","34","18 April 2002"," A confused, self-indulgent mess of a movie.
","After watching 'Velvet Goldmine' for a second time I still have absolutely no idea what Todd Haynes was trying to achieve. He could have approached it as a straightforward biopic of Bowie and 70s glam (with the names changed to protect the ""innocent"" if need be), OR as a surreal, camp fantasy equal parts Ken Russell, Russ Meyer and Grant Morrison (Zenith, Doom Patrol, The Invisibles). But by doing both, or rather, neither, it's ends up a confused bore that pleases nobody. As an Eno fan I was happy to hear quite a lot of his (and Roxy Music's) songs used on the soundtrack, and some of the Bowie pastiches were very good also, but I find 'Velvet Goldmine' to be overlong and ultimately unsatisfying. I also think Haynes not entirely accurate equation of glam rock equaling homosexuality sheds more light on him than the actual era. The movie is more a post-Morrissey look at glam than a truthful document of an exciting and innovative musical period. 'Velvet Goldmine' contains a few enjoyable moments but not enough to recommend it. A great movie could be made about Bowie but this isn't it."

","I saw Goldmine years ago and it remains one of my favorites. Everything about this movie is amazing- from the music, to the costume and the actors. <br/><br/>Here we get a young Christian Bale as a struggling kid trying to grow up in the age of glam rock. The confusion of trying to be who you are and the confusion of trying to figure out who that person is, something that is understandable to anyone who has ever been a teenager. Like so many, he finds himself in music- that of Brian Slade. Meyers is outstanding as a lowly boy who makes it with the big boys. He plays the climb to fame brilliantly and the demise of glam rock with emotion. Toni Collette adds the flare that is necessary and shows the true strength in what a woman will do/put up with for love. She is a delight and she plays well with Meyers. Ewan McGregor is also terrific as Curt Wild, the perfect half to Slade's glam. <br/><br/>The music is what Goldmine is really all about. Meyers and McGregor sing some of the tunes themselves, but the addition of Radiohead's Thom Yorke to the mix as well as the boys from Placebo are an excellent addition to an already great soundtrack. Adding Lou Reed seems like over kill, but I'll take it- if there is anything that I learned from watching Goldmine many times- is that the bigger the better.<br/><br/>This is a great coming of age movie- it is a bit adult. There are heavy issues here such as drug abuse, alcoholism, adultery, homosexuality, orgies...be aware-"

","There is something about this movie that entrances people. Its about the death of Glam Rock, and even though this is a weird premise the stories of how one person changed the lives of many beautiful people without even being aware of it is mesmerizing...on top of that you get a guilty pleasure out of all the make-up, sex, and extremely bizarre music. In this David Bowiesque film, there's romance, music, Oscar Wilde, aliens, and Ewan McGregor with an American accent. I own it, love it, and play the soundtrack in my car without any inhibitions. Christian Bale is a journalist attempting to figure out where his once-upon-a-time hero/rock-star Brian Slade (Meyers) disappeared after a fake death ten years prior. During his search he encounters an old lover of Slade's who weaves the story of the singer's beginnings, and Brian's American ex-wife who remembers of his bitter end. All of this is summed up with Curt Wild (Mcgregor)This movie claims to be about Brian Slade, but it's about the people he left in his wake."

","One of the problems of doing a semi-fictionalized narrative is that the resulting piece will invariably be compared to its sources.  The way to combat this is by creating something that is fresh, dynamic and full of ideas, great story and characters: something that overwhelms the audience and makes them forget what its derivations are.  This, I regret to say, is what ""Velvet Goldmine"" failed to do.  I couldn't but be aware, as I sat through the film, of all the references passing across the screen, whether they be to people, places, songs or events.  This was particularly evident during the performance sequences. I'd watch Ewan McGregor doing his Iggy thing and be thinking, ""My that's a good cover of 'TV Eye.'  That Mr. Pop was one hell of a performer.  I kind of wish I was watching him now.""  The same was doubly true of the fella playing Bowie.  I kept thinking, naggingly, throughout the whole movie, that these guys were but pale imitations of the real thing.  It was very distracting.  Now, several years ago I saw ""I Shot Andy Warhol"", a film I found thoroughly engaging.  To be certain, there were inaccuracies, characters who were not too faithfully portrayed (Candy Darling comes to mind).  However, I wasn't aware of it while I was watching the movie.  I was too absorbed in the drama.  Mary Harron might have taken liberties, but she put on a good show, something Todd Haynes failed to do.  The wan figure of Brian Slade, petulant and insipid, offered little from beginning to end.  I could just as easily have been watching a perfume ad. Curt Wild wasn't much better.  If these fellas were supposed to be revolutionaries, they sure didn't revolve much.  The young reporter at the center of the film was such a hapless dolt that I could hardly be bothered to share his passion.  Haynes certainly has an eye for style.  The film was a lavish and beautiful thing to behold, sort of a moving Pierre & Gilles composition.  But pageantry isn't its own reward.  It is possible that this might have been fully fitting with his intention.  He might have been principally interested in creating some sort of didactic exegesis.  But his ideas weren't strong enough, it was too weak an intellectual broth to hold much critical weight.  And if you haven't got enough brains to pitch a good argument you might as well charm the old fashioned way, with character, dialogue, story and plot.  And frankly, this picture was a bore."

","Despite the instructions at the start of the movie, this should definitely NOT be played at maximum volume. It is interesting only for a few vague references to the actual history of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Brian Eno. Ewen McGregor is cool for about 30 seconds as he does an impression of Iggy (Curt Wild) on stage. The other guy playing Bowie/Brian is simply awful. The film follows a flashback/flash forward then and now history, through the eyes of a journalist who was there, and has been assigned to write a retrospective. His character is poorly developed. Mostly he stands around in concerts and looks bewildered. This is supposed to represent his sexual identity crisis. The pacing is terrible, the lip syncing is terrible, the set pieces are terrible, the story is terrible the acting is terrible. Oh yeah there is a stupid reference to Oscar Wilde. I think the movie also tries to criticize Bowie's music and image in the 80s, but does so in a completely obtuse manner. If you want to see great androgynous costumes, and hear great glitter rock, you are much better off renting the Bowie concert flick ""Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars."" Velvet Goldmine is another great idea turned in to a bad movie."

","Todd Haynes' fantasy rethinking of an era in rock history, as a David Bowie-like singer in the early '70s burns out and disappears, and one of his most ardent young fans--now a music journalist--interviews friends and colleagues hoping to get at the truth. Past-and-present collage isn't given a very pointed treatment (once the narrative has gone a certain distance, a flashback dating back even further in time drains the immediacy out of the proceedings), though the design of the picture and the personalities involved are very colorful, as is the soundtrack, a mix of newly written tunes and classics. The U.K. truly got a colorful slice of the glam-rock era (as opposed to the U.S., which pretty much missed the boat--and the musical point), and the film, mostly set in England, nails that distinctive time and place with embracing accuracy. Haynes is also shrewd enough to remember the particular talents impersonated here were not the originators of the scene--that all musical trends date back, and nothing is ever truly original or lasts forever. The cast is uniformly excellent: sexy, decadent, kinetic, nervy. Haynes isn't a master of the outré (like, say, Ken Russell), but neither is he a junky or disrespectful filmmaker, and even in the lowest moments of their lives, this crazy collection of hedonists still look and sound pretty great. **1/2 from ****"
"Isobel_and_Eugene","Null","6","7","4 August 2011"," An absorbing, multidimensional film experience
","I first saw Velvet Goldmine ten years ago. It is one of the few films that I faithfully keep coming back to. While the initial, back of the DVD synopsis/premise of Velvet Goldmine ""Music reporter goes to investigate the whereabouts of a glam rock idol ten years after his fake death"" sounds simple enough, the movie once you begin watching becomes so much more than that. The appeal of Velvet Goldmine lies in its multidimensionality-each frame is sumptiously layered with subtleties, references and allusions that absorb the unsuspecting viewer and throw him or her for a loop that slips (and trips) in and out of 'reality' and back. Repeat viewings definitely add to the film experience and help viewers catch all those subtleties and references..because, lets face it the first time viewer might get a little distracted by the films impeccable visual execution and lead stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Ewan McGregor and Christian Bale at the height of their sexy, youthful, pre-Hollywood prime. The fragmented, figurative language-laden parallel narratives of Velvet Goldmine challenge and stimulate the viewer while the dreamy, ethereal visuals and music offer moments of breathing space and beauty. I particularly like how the director leads the viewer through the Brian and Arthur (and even Curt) narratives and how the viewers impressions of these characters from the beginning of film change towards the end. Even though Velvet Goldmine eschews traditional character development the viewer still learns enough about Brian and Curt and gets to know Arthur, initially the perceived outsider rather well. Velvet Goldmine is not a straightforward glam rock biopic. It is part fanfiction, part fictionalized music mythology set in the context of 1970s glam rock era London. The combination songs written for the film and real music from the period therefore fits perfectly. As to the gay content-it is there but not as focal as some reviewers make it out to be."

Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), an investigative reporter, interviews the friends and business associates of the ex-pop icon trying to find out what lays behind the glitter make-up, flamboyance, outrage, and the intoxicating freedom of the sexual revolution. While uncovering the truth about disappearing star, Arthur will come to terms with his own past.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant, wild (e), beautiful, exotic, as the rock movement it depicts and in its best moments (which are plenty) it has achieved the result that the praised to the high heaven ""Moulin Rouge!"" could only dream about. VG is lurid, is dreamlike, is surreal and it recreates perfectly the decadent world of 1970 Glam Rock with its androgynous male rock stars who looked like the strange and exotic flowers of faraway worlds, with its nostalgia and obsession, glitter and psychedelic colors, the world where Oscar Wilde whose name has been mentioned more than once would've felt at home.<br/><br/>The film's visual palette is incredible, the costumes are jaw-dropping, the music and singing simply mesmerize. Ewan McGregor's acting and courage (Curt Wild, the punk-rock pioneer who looked in the movie very much like another Curt) was among the most memorable along with a relative newcomer Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Brian Slade and incredible Toni Collette as Brian's American wife Mandy. While certainly not everyone's cup of tea due to many scenes with homosexuality, drugs, and full frontal nudity, the movie deserves to be seen for the successful recreation of the world of glam and glitter rock, ""elegant crowds amid sumptuous ornamentation""."

Some people have faulted Toni Collette's performance for the same thing, but if she's basing her character on Angie Bowie or Jerry Hall, both Americans who were well known for putting on an English affectation, then she was right on the money. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Christian Bale were both great in their roles, despite the lackluster writing, but as long as the movie is (just under 2 hours), I still feel like Brian Slade's character arc was a tad unresolved.<br/><br/>I liked the re-appropriation of Brian Eno, Iggy Pop, T-Rex, New York Dolls & Roxy Music songs in the film. However, the original songs aren't great, probably because any observant David Bowie fan could tell that they really wanted to use his songs for those particular scenes, and the story goes that Bowie outright rejected the use of his songs for the movie, because he didn't like the script. Frankly, I don't blame him. The writing and the direction are the movie's biggest faults. The costuming and look of the film were a mixed bag, some parts great, some not. Overall, I was unconvinced that I was watching anything that remotely resembled anything that could have come out in the 70's, mostly when it came to the live performances or the ""promo video"" sections.<br/><br/>From what I've read, it's a pretty polarizing movie, but I think I'm in the vast minority, because I really didn't love it or hate it. The flaws of the film keep it from being great, and the things the movie gets right keep it from being horrible. Overall, it was just eh. I do think there could be a better movie made at some point about the glam rock era, but this isn't it."

","I ignored this movie upon its release due, solely, to Roger Ebert's assertion that David Bowie deserves better. I regret my decision to avoid Velvet Goldmine for so long because, frankly, David Bowie doesn't deserve to have a movie made about him. Do not misunderstand: I love the Thin White Duke, Ziggy, and A Lad Insane, but, frankly, his life is probably not interesting enough to recreate on screen. HOWEVER, a fictionalized version of that life, amalgamated with the lives of similar rock stars and taken to the most imaginative limits, is worth it. It's totally enthralling and utterly breathtaking, and, from one point of view, wholly faithful, if not deferential, to Mr. Bowie. Plus, by eschewing reality to a certain extent, Todd Haynes can make the movie he wants rather than bend his ideals to a real life. <br/><br/>So, basically, I avoided one of the most brilliant movies of the last 15 years based on a single point of view. As much as I value Mr. Ebert's opinion, he was sorely mistaken when it comes to Velvet Goldmine. His gravest error? That would be thinking this movie is supposed to be about David Bowie. Yes, to a certain extent it is. Brian Slade is, very much, an emulation of that man. Maxwell Demon is analogous to Ziggy Stardust; his bouts with cocaine addiction are comparable to Bowie's mid- to late 1970s travails as well. Curt Wild can stand in for Iggy Pop, whom David Bowie helped during his glammy hey-day (he produced, horribly, the Stooges final studio record, Raw Power). BUT not everything adds up, nor is it supposed to. Brian Slade is a melange of everyone from David Bowie to Marc Bolan to Brian Eno to Brian Ferry to David Johanson to... Curt Wild calls to mind Iggy Pop, clearly, but he's more sensitive and with stringy blond hair that clearly recalls Curt Cobain. Jack Fairy could be Brian Ferry or Marc Bolan or Andy Warhol. The fact is that everyone is everyone, on some level. They're all mixed up and they're supposed to be. <br/><br/>The movie isn't about people, but rather about a movement, which these people happen to demonstrate. The movie is about the abandonment of the pansexuality embraced by glitter. Those who rode the glam wave--who supported being gay or bisexual--made an about face. Brian Slade, in the film, becomes the straight man, pun intended--the lackey of a fascist government in an alternate 1984. Isn't that, sort of, what glam did? Didn't the ambiguous Bowie become the Iman's husband and bury his make-up and dress wearing ways in favor of making in extremely lucrative, but artistically vapid, records? Didn't Marc Bolan sputter out in a ball of cocaine? Didn't David Johanson, the gorgeous man/woman on the cover of the NY Dolls first record become Buster Poindexter? Didn't Brian Ferry choose to become a lounge singer? Didn't Brian Eno choose to... Well, no Brian Eno didn't change so much as remain weird in a different way. In any event, like Curt Wild says in the film, not everyone who says they're bisexual is; they're just doing it because they think it's cool. Velvet Goldmine is Todd Haynes's slap in the face of those artists who abandoned a truly challenging path for something a little less curvy. <br/><br/>Of course, it's not just the weighted ideology of the film that's brilliant. It's also the colors and the acting and the atmosphere. This movie is candy colored and wonderful to look at. It feels like Alladin Sane or The Slider sounds. It's like ingesting the warm jets. It's glam. And the acting's top-notch too. This is, quite simply, a splendid motion picture with quite a bit to say about artistic backtracking. It's just great."
"KamikazeBaby","6","3","3","5 August 2013"," A fairly entertaining (if rather silly) film...
","This is a fairly entertaining (if rather silly) film that is very loosely based upon David Bowie's career as Ziggy Stardust and his relationships with Iggy Pop, Angie Bowie, etc. Some of the scenes depicted, such as Bowie's performance for the actors from Andy Warhol's Pork, ARE based on true events. The writer, Todd Haynes, incorrectly portrayed other true events: for example, it was probably Lou Reed Haynes was thinking of who received shock treatments to supposedly discourage homosexual behavior; Iggy did NOT, nor did he even HAVE a brother; he is the only child of schoolteacher parents. He DID grow up in a trailer near Detroit, although at the time trailers were more of a novelty, not the symbol of white trash that they are today. Ewan McGregor didn't do much for me trying to portray the Iggy character, Curt Wild (and the Rats? Ha ha ha, there WAS actually a glam band called The Rats but Iggy's band was, of course, The Stooges). Apparently Iggy co-operated at least to an extent with the filmmakers since they used the Stooges' song ""T.V. Eye"". Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who plays the part of the Bowie character, Brian Slade, does a terrible job singing it; the New York Dolls ""Personality Crisis"" is also butchered. David Bowie refused to allow his music to be used (showing his usual intelligence and taste). Some good tunes from Roxy Music, Brian Eno, and Slade (the actual glam band not the fictional title character) are used, however. ""Needle in the Camel's Eye"" is especially effective for the opening of the film. All in all, this COULD have been a great movie but instead is just so-so. There are some great tunes and clothes to admire; glam rock fans will enjoy those! But perhaps one should just watch footage of Ziggy Stardust or the New York Dolls or Marc Bolan..."

","The Citizen Kane of rock & roll movies, almost literally - even the framing sequence evokes Kane, with a present-day reporter charged with the task of rediscovering the rise and fall of a long-gone Ziggy Stardust-type rocker. Christian Bale is the closeted reporter, seen in the present as living in an almost monochromatic world, while his 8-track flashbacks to the tri-sexual '70s are painted on a palette of liquid LSD.<br/><br/>The story was originally intended as a sort of Bowie bio-pic, but ended up a mix of urban legends cut from tales of Iggy Pop, Kurt Cobain, Bryan Ferry, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Jim Dandy, David Johansen, and others. The soundtrack mixes classic glam tracks by Lou Reed with new songs done for the film, performed by various super groups with members of Placebo, the New York Dolls, and others.<br/><br/>""Follow the brooch"" to trace the reincarnated spirit of Oscar Wilde, the world's first pop star, through the movie - (SPOILERS ALERT)<br/><br/>First, Jack Fairy finds Wilde's brooch as a boy, seeming to be guided by Wilde's own tendency toward bawdy bacchanalia and pop creativity. Fledgling rocker Brian Slade steals the brooch from Fairy during a love tryst, and thus takes Fairy's place in the pop culture zeitgeist.<br/><br/>Slade gives the brooch to Curt Wild and subsequently finds his own star falling, as Curt takes on the task of epitomizing a modern day Wilde. However, Curt implodes (much like his historical antecedent), and ends up giving the brooch to - who else? - the Writer, Arthur Stuart, in search of what really happened to the glittery-glam world he once thought his generation had (re)created.<br/><br/>Wilde's life rather than his work seems to be the story template. Curt only becomes (briefly) articulate and dandy-fied after he gets the brooch, and in fact is wearing it at the staged press conference where he and Brian Slade essentially dance a gay minuet, dressed as French royalty and announcing their personal and professional pairing - with a public kiss, no less, Curt now living out Oscar Wilde's unrestrained and in-discrete libido alongside Slade.<br/><br/>When a similar sort of public brou-ha-ha landed the real Wilde in prison, that all but broke him for the rest of his life, the same way fading punk-star Curt Wild seems to lose all inspiration and muse, withdrawing from bravado to whimper to ""whatever happened to.....""<br/><br/>I like to think Arthur Stuart ends up with the story of his career after the movie wraps, and that he eventually becomes a well-known and respected writer.<br/><br/>If he ends up far more celebrated in death than in life, well, then he will have lived out Wilde's own final chapters --- Arthur was probably buried wearing that effin brooch ---<br/><br/>Maybe it's not the REAL story of '70s glam rock, but it represents that scene better than any ten eps of VH1's ""I Love the '70s"" ---- I've played the entire soundtrack album at least once a month since I saw this flick on its first video release ----"

","Velvet Goldmine is a perfectly good idea, and is essentially a loving homage to a bygone era, that of 70's glam rock. Christian Bale is fine as a journalist who on hearing disturbing news of his teen-era idol, has flashbacks telling the story of his immersion in the world of glam rock and the seventies music scene. Unfortunately this idol is a thinly disguised thumbnail sketch (you might even say parody) of David Bowie. The other main character is an equally pointless caricature of Iggy Pop. The story takes some elements of the story of their careers in the mid seventies and goes its merry way. This would be fine but for one major flaw: the music is not Bowie/Iggy. It is originally produced glam rock pastiche and is so awful the appeal of the era would be mystifying to someone unfamiliar with it. Who then would like this film? I have no idea. Todd Haynes must love Bowie, if not why make a film which is so transparently about him? Does he think his film shows 70's glam in a favourable light in any way? As a huge fan of both Bowie and Iggy pop, I think Velvet Goldmine is utterly appalling."

"mick-137","1","19","33","11 February 2008"," Stunningly fails to evoke period or place, people or process
","What happened to popstar Brian Slade after his fake death and fall from grace? Does anyone care? Based on the more salient aspects from the life of David Bowie (bisexual wife, mod beginnings, stage alter-ego) this hollow move signally fails to include any of the aspects that might make such a figure fascinating, or even mildly interesting to fans or intimates. Instead Rhys Meyers' Slade is a total cypher,more Gareth Gates than Ziggy Stardust. Indeed, the whole movie plays as if all the key scenes--the ones that establish the characters and their relationships with each other--have been left out.<br/><br/>The movie is also largely clueless about what '70s Britain was like and how glam rock fitted into it. Labouring under the impression that glam was some kind of countercultural youth movement on a par with punk or even New Romanticism, it misses the only truly curious thing about glam--its mainstream appeal. <br/><br/>Crushingly, that movie also strikes numerous false notes when it comes to the music. Any project of this sort faces a devil's choice between reusing the music of the period or pastiching it. Goldmine attempts both. The reassignment of old Roxy Music, Steve Harley and Brian Eno numbers to news performers jars,and undermines some fine songs. And the original numbers are all complete clunkers. The only time this comes close to working is when the Suzi Quattro clone covers the New York Dolls, and Ewan MacGregor--as Iggy Pop-alike Curt Wild--confusingly gets to do an actual Iggy song.<br/><br/>There are compensations--MacGregor's Iggy impersonation is spot on in everything but physique, and Christian Bale demonstrating again what a cruelly underrated and underused actor he is. But--like Absolute Beginners and Moulin Rouge--the movie is crippled by its own artifice. The attempt to rope in Oscar Wilde as a posthumous dialogue writer makes all the characters into identikit posturing bores. And the regular nods to Citizen Kane only underline how utterly non-enigmatic the howling void at the centre of this movie really is."

They all seemed like one dimensional caricatures.<br/><br/>Never did I feel the soul behind Brian Slade (his inspirations, his songwriting, his artistic process -- isn't that a big part of a musician?!) All I know is he's a guy that likes to perform in flamboyant clothing, with no reference to where his music is really coming from. And the music wasn't terribly inspiring either. And I never forgot he is lip syncing.<br/><br/>Toni Colette did a good job, but the film makers never have enough consideration to explain why her accent vacillates from British to American throughout the film.

"cj-tk421","9","7","10","27 February 2012"," Worth viewing many times
","Velvet Goldmine is centred on the glam movement of the early 70s, and most of the people and incidents in the film are loosely based on real people and occurrences. It follows the rise and fall of a Ziggy Stardust-type character, Maxwell Demon (Brian Slade), and those around him, and at the same time, the deep influence he had on a fan's life (Arthur Stuart). Brian Slade retires in a hoax and disappears; a decade later, in the conservative, depressing, Cold War Reagan-era the now reporter Arthur is tasked with finding out what happened to Brian Slade, taking him back to his own past, and exposing a cover-up. Judging by many of the comments here, people are a bit confused by this film. It wasn't meant for a mass audience; some background is helpful to appreciate it.<br/><br/>First, to address some criticisms: 1. the time line is confusing – it's not meant to be a linear tale; pay attention, it shifts between past and present 2. not factually accurate – it's not a biography! 3. the costumes aren't accurate – true! the clothing was improved; the costumes play a very important part in the contrast between past and present and the overall development of the story 4. drags a bit in some places, with weird music video sequences – perhaps an homage to some 70s directors? 5. the American scenes were so obviously not in America – so true, this really does detract from the film, but I'm guessing budget was the issue here 6. male sexuality – double-standard here; seems that it's OK to exploit women sexually and show them naked in movies, but not OK to sexually exploit men or show gay sex scenes, even tasteful ones 7. Todd Haynes (director/writer) is American – will be discussed more below Although this film has a cult following among younger people, glam rock was mainly influential to two generations; first, the younger Baby Boomers – glam rockers often name-checked artists, authors, and musicians, so they also helped introduce the arts to their fans; many formed their own bands. Second, Gen Xers were also influenced by this era, as many of their favourite bands were glam rock fans and name-checked their influences. As a result, Gen X music fans bought old David Bowie, Roxy Music, T Rex, etc albums and read the unauthorised biographies of David Bowie. In turn, many of these Gen Xers were also inspired to form bands or get involved in arts and fashion. The Britpop/Cool Britannia era of the 90s owes a lot to glam rock, but its influence has never been limited to the UK. Todd Haynes' country of residence is irrelevant; it's obvious that he was deeply influenced by the era and knows the mythology surrounding it very well.<br/><br/>Helpful context: During Bowie's 'Let's Dance' comeback in the early 80s, he faced much criticism for trying to erase his past image. Bowie did not disappear as in the film, he actually made some extremely influential albums as 'The Thin White Duke,' but then he came back as a whitewashed, corporate type. Fans of his previous work were disappointed, and many journalists of the time commented on this, for example, Neil Tennant, who was writing for 'Smash Hits' (USA 'Star Hits') at the time, and whom Arthur is probably based upon.<br/><br/>It is necessary to be familiar with the glam era and David Bowie to appreciate this film properly. Oscar Wilde is also quoted and paraphrased extensively in the film, and all the major players are shown as carrying or passing on his pin.<br/><br/>Velvet Goldmine has been compared to Citizen Kane in structure, which is correct, but in content, I disagree. It is not really a 'rise and fall' tale, but more of a personal story, about the nature of the image versus the self, how much of one's self should be in one's art, etc, and about stepping out of someone else's shadow and creating one's own legacy.<br/><br/>Not enough good things can be said about the actors; these were challenging roles, but acted beautifully. Also, actors are usually bad at playing musicians, so it was great to see that all of the musicians/pop stars besides Brian Slade and Curt Wild were played by actual pop stars/musicians. Also, Lindsay Kemp (Bowie's acting teacher) has a small role in this. Check out the cast list, it's really impressive.<br/><br/>Here's a cheat sheet of who's based on who: Brian Slade – David Bowie; Curt Wild – Iggy Pop, also sometimes Lou Reed; Arthur Stuart – Neil Tennant, shades of Morrissey; Jack Fairy – composite character, at first loosely based on Marc Bolan, later Thin White Duke Bowie, but not really based on any one person; Jerry Devine – Tony Defries; Shannon – Coco Schwab; Mandy Slade – Angela Bowie; Cecil – Ken Pitt; Polly Small – Patty Smith; Rodney – Rodney Bingenheimer"

","Velvet Goldmine sounds brilliant on paper, but in action it's an overlong, mashed pulp of glitter, bad hair and dodgy camera work. What the hell was it about? Maybe it's cause I'm young and don't appreciate the era or something, but the concert and music video scenes dragged on for far too long. The storyline jumped from one part to another, and then back again so you didn't know what was going on. This kind of arty filming works in some cases, but not in this one. Although I did like some of the music, it just got too much for me in the end. The acting, on the other hand, was very well done. Ewan McGregor gave a great performance (I almost believed he was a glam rock star), Jonathon Rhys Meyers was perfectly cast as the David Bowie lookalike, and Christian Bale gave an outstanding portrayal (as usual) of the lonely, confused Arthur Stuart. Apart from the acting, everything else was rubbish. I generally like movies, and I definately thought I'd like this considering Christian Bale was in it, but even he couldn't save it. You'd have to of lived in the seventies to like this movie, or have a serious passion for platform shoes, glitter and sparkly lycra."
"tangietangerine","10","4","5","4 August 2014"," All mysteries are just more needles in the camel's eye
","This film is definitely one of my favorites among the ones who pay some kind of homage to rock'n'roll history. That opening scene with Jack Fairy's childhood and then the credits rolling to the sound of Needle In the Camel's Eye is one of the best and most exciting things I've ever seen. I guess I could say I love everything about it, how can you not love a cast like that? They're all wonderful and so believable in their performances, especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Ewan McGregor, who had very physical roles, but pulled it off just fine – I thought McGregor was especially brilliant in this, performing the songs live and jumping and throwing himself around, a certain Mr. Osterberg would be proud.<br/><br/>The story is an obvious portrait of David Bowie's relationship to Iggy Pop and Lou Reed in the 70's (adding a little mixture of Kurt Cobain, why not?), a decade I imagine was unique to rock'n'roll, filled with exciting new music, rebellion and social changes, but it's also a story about discoveries and growing up, represented by Christian Bale's character (""That's me, dad, that's me!""). It's not an unknown feeling to us all, coming across a circumstance where we have to revisit years past, and the memories of what we once were may sound strange. Along with the glitter and the glam rock comes the melancholia of being a part of a movement that is already in decadence, because all great things must burn fast and come to an end. Besides, what other movie presents us with a more delightful sight than that of Ewan McGregor and Christian Bale loving each other beneath a glitter rain brought on by a UFO? Words are unnecessary after that."
"rap53","6","4","5","5 June 2010"," I'm not gay, not that there's anything wrong with that
","I saw this movie on Bravo so my comments are based on the edited cable version.<br/><br/>A) I think this topic would have been better handled by a director who had lived and experienced this music and era in general as a teen-ager or young adult, unlike Haynes. The director seemed to be making queer theory political points wrapped in glitter rather than presenting an understandable epic of that epoch, probably leaving many heterosexual viewers out in the cold. The reference to Ronald Reagan ( President Reynolds in the movie) is one example. It is absurd to imply that Reagan was somehow responsible for the death of glam as it is for some gay activists to blame him for the spread of HIV. Nevertheless, I found the film enthralling both for the visuals and the recognizable historical figures and events B) I was somewhat connected to the rock scene of that time and to glam in particular so I think I have some insight to offer younger readers, although I am sure Haynes himself has more knowledge of gay history and ""inside"" glam gossip than myself.<br/><br/>C)The ""green pin"" may combine both alien power as in the Green Lantern comic books that Haynes probably read as a child ( childhood is given strong play in the beginning ) and an icon of homosexual experience passed on from one time period to the next as expressed by Allen Ginsburg. Ginsburg once told of how ,through a series of sex partners going back in time, he was connected to Walt Whitman. Not exactly glam but he was a poet like Wilde, and Whitman's work is known for it's ethereal, pre-maturely modern tone as in ""I sing the body electric"" ( Alien Anal Probes anybody ? ). That poem was written over 20 years before anybody had electricity in their home. It was also the source of the title of a science-fiction story written by Ray Bradbury. Another film connecting UFO's,bohemian sex and alternative music is ""Liquid Sky"", which I am sure influenced Haynes.<br/><br/>D) The Slade character is obviously based on Bowie, who came to be known to non-glam fans via his title role in the science-fiction movie "" The Man who Fell to Earth"" . Gay equals alienated equals ""alien"" may explain the UFO at the beginning. Bowie is much more talented than the Slade character whose vapidity and posing is similar to the now obscure real-life person known as ""Jobriath"", who like many who led the ""drug,sex and rock'roll lifestyle"" of the seventies died of AIDS in the 80s. Like Slade and Davie Jones/David Bowie/Ziggy Stardust, Jobriath also performed under a second stage name ( Cole Berlin ) Unlike Bowie but similar to Slade, Jobriath blamed his brief career on the failures of an egotistical manager.<br/><br/>E) Ewan's Iggy stage performance was a great impersonation, almost comical in it 's accuracy.<br/><br/>F) I could not figure out who Jack Fairy was based on but he reminded me of Klaus Noemi, whose cover of ""You Don't Own Me"" can still be heard on the Rush Limbaugh program.<br/><br/>At last, an actual semiotic signifier that the Reaganites did co-opt glam !!!"

What I love about this movie is the feeling of being a part of the glamrock scene, even if you are too young to actually remember. When watching this movie, you just think you had seen it all live on stage.<br/><br/>Granted, the characters are all fictional and fairy tale-like (although the similarities to certain real-life celebrities of that era are quite obvious), but still they appear so real that you think you've known them for ages, even if they hardly tell anything about themselves.<br/><br/>That's another fascination of the movie: you will not understand it upon first viewing. You must see it again and again to catch every detail and every twist in the timeline. And what bliss it is to find out where a scene is placed in the timeline or to think you have found the answers to one of the many burning questions you are most likely to have. I would love to sit down and have a talk with Todd Haynes and ask him a whole lot of questions about Velvet Goldmine. ^_^<br/><br/>Another beautiful aspect is the openness with which it treats the subject of homo-/bisexuality. It's never really made an issue, it's just there and nobody cares. That's quite a refreshing difference for the gay audience every once in a while!<br/><br/>So, if you like amazing images, colorful and glittering pictures, great music, heart-wrenching love, bombastic stage shows, deep wisdom and witty humor, then this is the movie for you.

Now, usually, I'm one of the people complaining about ""pretentious arty crap"", but this film eludes that title gracefully; it is truly worth seeing.  I understand that this is fiction, and not truly the stories of Iggy Pop and David Bowie, but as a chic born way after the Glam Rock Era faded away, I am everlastingly grateful to this film for bringing that era back to the forefront.  Velvet Goldmine makes me nostalgic for an Era that passed long before I was born...<br/><br/>The film was visually beautiful.  The glittered and all-pampered-up scenes meld nicely with the raw choatic sensuality prevalent in the film.  The montage format makes things interesting as well.

Rhys Meyers excelled at bringing the controversial Brian Slade to life; I both loved and hated Slade, as well as pitied and gloated over him.  You can't help but despise the man just a little bit at his selfish antics; his unthinking pursuit of his own goals at everyone else's expense makes you want to pummel him.  And yet, when you see him with Curt Wild (Ewan MacGregor), you start to love him all the same. Brian Slade aka Maxwell Demon aka THE BIGGEST POSER YOU'LL EVER SEE is pretentious, cold, and arrogant, and yet the glimpses of vulnerablity and love you barely see within make him suddenly human.<br/><br/>
Christian Bale's character, Arthur, was also invaluable to the storyline. It's so moving to see his story, from uncertain and innocent boy to the jaded man he becomes.  His last scene, where he says, ""It's a freedom you can allow yourself...or not,"" really got to me, and you can't help but hope that his character will be even braver in the future.  His character speaks to all the timid and learning ones out there.<br/><br/>However...MacGregor stole the show, and I'm not just being partial.  Curt Wild was an AMAZING character; his total and unapologetic honesty with himself, his close friends, his love Brian Slade, and his audience leave him something to be respected and admired.  He accomplishes sincerity without being jaded, cruel, or defeated; even in the end, where most would be downtrodden, there is still a unquenchable glint of vitality in him.  He is wild, unpredictable, and more-often-than-not crude (WHOOO HOOO!!!  NAKED EWAN!!!  HEHEH!), but he shines like the shooting stars in the film.<br/><br/>
The love story between Curt and Brian is sweet and touching, and it leaves you hoping that they beat the odds at the end, and are still together. Take a look at the small details---like where Curt is working when Arthur calls him up at the end---and see if you can't tell me that their romantic life, at least, came together.<br/><br/>That's the beauty of this film...alot of it can be left up to personal interpretation.  This means the plot can be confusing if you aren't paying strict attention; if you leave the room or ignore a section, especially near the end of the film, you'll believe that it didn't make sense.  There are so many details in this film that seem irrelevant at first glance, but the more times you watch this film...the better it gets.  In reality, this film will totally blow you away, if you allow it.<br/><br/>A must see; Velvet Goldmine is my favorite film EVER."
"Dia Klain","10","6","9","10 August 2001"," I wish there was something higher then a 10 to give here!
","I have by now watched this movie about seven times all the way though, and many parts over 20 times. I have seen it by far more then any other movie. I know every detail, every word, and every gesture. Yet, I feel as though I missed something because some people think Jonathan Rhys Meyers acted badly! Perhaps some thought his acting was a bit cold and icy, well, hallo! He is playing a rock star that is unreal what do you think he is going to act like?! Also, for some reason, everyone just loves Ewan in this movie, but I still have not seen anything all that wonderful, sure, he plays a grunge rock star who likes to jump up and down with temper and be insulting, while really he turns out to be an ok guy after all. But from the reserved Brian Shade I felt so much more. He reminded me of an innocent, a bit confused, a bit unloyal  youngster that gets dragged into star life through his constant searching for his cattle of fish. The whole time he feels rather more innocent and unsuspecting then the rest of the characters. Having gotten that off of my chest. I must also comment on another opinion. Some people fancy that the script was flat and shallow. Actually much of the movie was actually in quotes, (many Oscar Wilde's). I think it was anything but shallow for every time anyone spoke they said something that immediately I found myself questioning and pondering over. Overall, this should not be treated as much as a move with a plot and regular characters living out a fragment of life, as a musical/music video that is very beautifully done, but with content and meaning. Or perhaps as a surreal love story? You will either hate this movie and simply not understand it, or you will adore it and it will become as religion touching your life deeply. And, yes, what ever remains of a plot is rather hard to interpret at times and I only understood everything after the third or fourth time I watched it. Over all, try not to think of this as necessarily the 70s but more as a surreal world, ageless, and reflecting our own. Allow me to sum up; excellent actors, superior script, beautifully directed, wonderful music, very artistic and colorful, you may love it, you may hate it, you probably will not forget it."
"Cineanalyst","6","2","2","10 September 2018"," Citizen Bowie
","As flamboyant and glittery as its glam rock subject, ""Velvet Goldmine"" mines the words of Oscar Wilde, the structure of Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"" and the dystopian vision of George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" but is ultimately superficial, satisfied with its own supposed mystique, but then, I guess, so was glam rock.<br/><br/>Like ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), it's a thinly-veiled and fictionalized sidelong-glance biopic--in this case, of David Bowie--from the perspective of interviews conducted by a journalist. In part, these interviews are even staged like those in the 1941 film, and the investigative story begins with a film being screened, like the newsreel of Charles Foster Kane, except with the film itself burning up at the end. I guess its Rosebud is the entire glam rock scene, although the supposed mystery involves the alleged mainstream selling out by the Bowie-esque figure, Brian Slade, in the Reagan era--here named that of an unseen President Reynolds. Specifically, in the year 1984, alluding to Orwell, and Slade's transformation is represented by a name change and plastic surgery, which is a secret conspiracy for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>In addition to ""Kane,"" the journalist provides his own memories as a fan of the rock stars and his own history of homosexual activity. On top of that, there are UFO sightings in the spirit of glam rock's fascination with science fiction, and an emerald pin that's traced back to Oscar Wilde, with the suggestion that Wilde was an extra-terrestrial, I guess, and a separate female narrator for the introduction. Wilde doesn't really factor into the main narrative, though, except to lend his surname to one character and for the script to sprinkle his epigrams about. For instance, Slade will throw in a line such as ""Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders,"" from the author's novel, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" which the film directly references in a classroom scene.<br/><br/>The ""Dorian Gray"" connection is why I finally got around to seeing this, as I was seeking out movie adaptations and reworkings since reading the book. I suppose, I've also been somewhat spoiled recently by having viewed two other rock musicals that recall 19th-century Gothic horror and were themselves box-office bombs that later gathered a cult following: ""Phantom of the Paradise"" (1974) and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (1975). The former, in particular, I consider to be a more integrated and interesting use of Wilde's ""Dorian Gray."" To my taste, the tunes of those actual 1970s rock musicals, as opposed to this trip down memory lane, were more catchy, too. I think the best songs in ""Velvet Goldmine"" are the ones that aren't original, and I probably would've liked it more had they received permission to use Bowie's songs. It also surely has a better, or at least more high profile, cast of actors, with the likes of Ewan McGregor, Christian Bale and Toni Collette, but I don't think any of the performances particularly stand out, except for maybe McGregor's flopping American accent... and his other flopping member. That said, this is a visually appealing picture, and the music is effectively used to transition between its scenes of glitz and glamour."
"chas77","6","2","2","2 December 1998"," Overlong mish-mash
","I've been reading the previous reviews and most of them appear to be divided into two camps: it was either a ""glorious"" look at the glam rock days or it was a bizarre pro-homo mess. I loved Haynes' previous films (""Safe"" and ""Superstar"", which is pretty impossible to find, btw), but I was really disappointed in this. I don't care about the pro-gay sentiments, but in the end, Haynes seemed to forget the story he was filming. There is no  pay-off. Instead of probing into the decadent demise of the Slade character he goes off into this twisted wonderland of the journalist's memories. Sure, that was interesting (the fact that he hooked up with the Iggy character) but in the end, it would have been more satisfying to see some sort of real conclusion to the story, rather than seeing him having sex on the rooftop. Great costumes, make up, set design...too bad the overall execution couldn't have been better."

It was delightful to see something different than the usual rise and fall storyline--but I found even more so enjoyable the fact that the chronology and plot revolved purely around visuals.  IT seems like style, color, and even sex take all the turns, and the characters are along for the go.  The performance scenes are like none other, particularly Curt Wild's (played by Ewan Mcgregor) first stage performance.  Haynes' direction is marvelous--truly inventive and watchable. ******** out of 10 on the IMDB scale."

","In the song ""Changes"", David Bowie sings ""Turn and face the strange..."". Well, I got to admit, this movie does make you face the strange.  This is one of the best movies I ever saw in my life.  It's artistic, graphic, and very creative in so many ways.  It was confusing one point to another, and can be hard to catch up with if you lose track of the movie (which I did at a few points) or don't know what it is about.  What I love the most about the movie is the artistic stride of the fashions, the music, and glam rock icons themselves such as Brian Slade, Curt Wild, just to name a few.  To be honest, Brian Slade didn't really make me think of David Bowie's famous character, Ziggy Stardust, but Mandy Slade did remind me very much about David's ex-wife, Angela ""Angie"" Bowie.  Toni played an excellent Angie-like Mandy Slade, and Jonathan did a splendid job as the strange, but wonderful Bowie-like Brian Slade.  I give credit to all the actors as a matter of fact! :o)<br/><br/>I highly do recommend this movie, but just one thing you should know:  The sex scenes in this film are very, very extreme, so don't watch this movie around children or anyone who doesn't like watching sex scenes in movies."
"margotvivanco","6","3","4","3 September 2013"," Metamusic and Ewan.
","A presumptuous movie that hasn't grown old well. <br/><br/>It could have been more bold or daring, but it is just sentimental and nostalgic in a strange way: I got the impression that the movie doesn't fully respect it's characters or their actions, which is not a problem if it creates a feeling of objective distance, but such detachment is broken by the sentimentalism: should we miss glam rock or laugh at it? The movie is about glam rock as a musical and a social movement, as an attitude, but the general tone is closer to an elegy than to a defense without actually being neither.<br/><br/>I liked the movie, though, specially Ewan McGregor and the performances by bands highly influenced by glam rock."
"dancerwh86","10","3","4","6 October 2004"," Showing a Different Revolution
","People are very quick to make movies about the 1960's and how much that changed people. This is clearly a valid point and many movies have dealt with different aspects of that decade. Velvet Goldmine though shines light on a very different era of change that may not be as well known to people especially younger generations such as myself. The film centers around glam rock and it's Bowie-like star Brian. Gay themes are prevalent and sexuality is played up. This movie is definitely not for everyone, but Todd Haynes's remarkable story telling and writing helps is worth a viewing in my opinion. I was fifteen years old when I first saw this movie and now I am eighteen. With the exception of David Bowie who I really knew only by name and maybe a few songs, I knew little about glam rock and what it was all about. This film supplies the viewer with a mixture of history, music and lessons on human nature. If you watch this movie on a superficial level you'll probably be shocked depending on how conservative you are, but take another look. The themes are poignant about finding out who you are and about society and if you look closely you can see a little bit of yourself in the characters in their dreams and vulnerabilities. It shows you another time that is not as well documented and it does it with Todd Haynes's fast paced flair. A personal favorite of mine 9/10."
"james_oblivion","Null","3","4","20 March 2003"," Hmmmmmmm...
","Hard to come up with a one-line summary for this one.  This is, of course, a fictionalized account of the Glam Rock era, with Bowie and Iggy clones.  The story plays out like a Glam version of Citizen Kane, and achieves what it sets out to do.  The acting is good all the way around, and the direction and cinematography are appropriate and stunning.  But enough of that.<br/><br/>What's really remarkable here is the music, particularly Ewan's cover of the Gimme Danger by Iggy & the Stooges and Jonathan's cover of Eno's glam classic, Baby's On Fire.  What's so remarkable about the performances in the film is that, not only were the actors REALLY singing these songs, but they were singing them live on the set...which NEVER happens in film.  Even if the actors' voices are being used, they are recorded in advance and lip-synched later for use in the film.  In Goldmine, however, Ewan and Jonathan's singing were recorded live as they were performing.  This gives the songs that feeling of live performance which simply CANNOT be faked. And it really works within the film.  This was a daring leap, and one which had to be made in order to make this film what it is.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of both Bowie and Iggy, I did have some small problems with the film...particularly the fact that Ewan looks (and at times, behaves) more like Kurt Cobain than Iggy Pop.  But being that this film is fictionalized and lays no claim to being otherwise, that's really neither here nor there.  This is NOT the story of Iggy Pop and David Bowie...it's a carbon copy from an alternate reality.  And as such, it works brilliantly.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention...it's a pretty good movie, as well."

The feathers floating all over the Lyceum audience...a bisexual lizardman...who came up with this stuff?  The Glam-rock soundtrack was excellent (it'll be living on my turntable for a month or two).  I couldn't believe that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Ewan MacGregor did all their own singing--that's just incredible.  And someone please cast Ewan as Kurt Cobain--it's too perfect a match to miss.  As a huge Bowie fan, I would point out little things that made this film a work of fiction rather than a bio-pic.  But they were so gauzily veiled that it was easily to tell what REALLY happened.

None of that matters. Take it for what it is:  an elegy on a brief flash of freedom.  It touches on the importance of decadence and the inevitable pain it causes.

"Morning Star","10","3","4","9 November 2000"," a haunting film
","In the early 70s I was a big fan of Bowie, Reed and Roxy Music.  So when I heard about this film I was interested in seeing it.  A few days ago I rented Velvet Goldmine and watched it.  I thought it was quite good and entertaining and was very impressed by the performances of McGregor and Bale. Although the use of new songs in glam style annoyed me a bit, I loved that they did use many originals from the 70s by people like Brian Eno, Roxy Music, Mick Ronson and Lou Reed.<br/><br/> I found myself thinking of the film over and over later that day and eventually looking it up here and then on other places online. I woke up the next morning thinking about it, which is extremely unusual for me.  Images from the film kept coming back to me all day and then I thought I'd look at those scenes again for a few minutes the next day..something I've never done before.  So I put the tape in meaning to fast forward it, but I got caught up in those fabulous opening credits.  Fast paced editing and action, colorful clothes on kids having fun and Eno's song really catch you up into the film (after that short but odd 'Wilde is from outer space' stuff).  From there I found myself standing beside the TV watching the whole film again. And the second time I saw it I REALLY loved it!  It was even better viewing it again.  Although I found Rhys-Meyers quite cold and uninvolving, many of the other actors turned in great work.  McGregor just threw himself into this part and electrified the screen.  And Bale was believable as a 17 year old innocent boy and a jaded 27 year old man...which is a very difficult act to pull off credibly.<br/><br/>My favorite parts of the film were 1) the sequence from when Curt and Brian drink a toast in a fantasy press conference to when Brian's ex-wife Mandy tells the Arthur who she found in bed together. and 2) when Arthur meets Curt in a flashback at the 70s concert till the end of the film.  I found that second part very emotionally moving to see when I watched the film a second time.  And it was so sad to see the bright and hopeful world of the 70s become the bleak and drab world of the 80s when they showed the 'present time' vs the flashbacks throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see Velvet Goldmine again! Rarely do I ever buy videotapes, but this one I gotta own so I can watch it repeatedly."

They work together in a way that makes you forget that you're watching a movie, with friends around, and your focus is entirely on the richly played events occurring before.  You think to yourself about the psychology and passion behind the actions of the cast, and it blows you away.

Unfortunately, the film is a mess despite the great music, the trippy performances and the compelling recreation of a classic subculture. Todd Haynes tries to slap some faux-Citizen Kane writing-an-article narrative onto what is otherwise a surreal, drug-induced haze of rock and sexual ambiguity, and while the journalist has his own story to tell through flashbacks, this only serves to throw us more off balance as we try to figure out which of the three male leads is supposed to be the protagonist. Haynes' work is frustrating because he can't decide whether to go for narrative or non-narrative, surreal or realist, linear or non-linear, and instead, he just goes with ""all of the above."" What this leaves us with is a wealth of good content made tiresome by the awkward, fractured structure of the piece."

As far as I'm concerned, this movie never rose above the level of fanboy drivel. There was no cohesive plot - it barely had a storyline, and what storyline it had made little to no sense. And the music... the music was beyond lousy.

There might be one here, but I couldn't find it.<br/><br/>Even a visual fantasy needs some kind of structure, if for no other reason than to propel the fantasy forward. But this ""film"" seems to have multiple beginnings, a chaotic, nonsensical middle, and a non-resolution. Scenes are put together apparently in random order. Hey mister director guy, help us out here. Is this someone's idea of an inside joke? If so, I didn't find it amusing.<br/><br/>None of the characters are worth caring about. They're all cardboard cutout dolls, stick-figure mannequins, two-dimensional caricatures. Self-proclaimed as artists, they're more flimflam than paragon. Maybe that's the point.<br/><br/>The underlying concept is intriguing. A music star fakes his own death. What ever became of him? And so, the Christian Bale character goes on a Citizen Kane journey, of sorts. But all that glittery glam, or glam-glitter, gets in the way. We're lost in a phantasmagoria of colorfully bizarre images. Along the way we come to the conclusion that the ""star"" is so shallow, so immature, so unlikeable we lose interest in him and his destiny. The only message I got out of this cinematic mess was that mod music audiences are duped into thinking that image is reality. But that's hardly original. And I doubt that was the director's intent.<br/><br/>Aimed at a pubescent crowd, ""Velvet Goldmine"" is hardly more than a flashy, moment-by-moment distraction. Lots of films, perhaps most, can deliver a higher quality, more mature form of distraction because they tell a coherent story that requires an attention span of greater than two microseconds."

","As a big fan of Bowie and Iggy Pop I was excited to see this film. There really haven't been any acurate films about this important era in rock history....and there still isn't.<br/><br/>Firstly, Haynes seems to think that the Glam Movement was a sexual awakening and thus the major themes in this film rather heavy handidly deal primarily with the conflicts surrounding the sexual atractions among the major characters. The Glam movement, while yes, dealt with ideas of sexual identity, was not ONLY about sex.<br/><br/>Secondly, the music is missguided and the soundtrack fails as a homage to the ground breaking ROCK that Bowie, Iggy, Reed, Velvet Underground, etc. shocked our post-sixties world with. They accomplished huge feats in a small amount of time and left us with some classic songs. The songs in VG pale in comparison and capture little of the spirit of these performers and....well dwell upon the sex.<br/><br/>The script was terrible and even went so far as to borrow a similar structure as that of Citizen Kane. It's weak, pointless, the characters are ALL stereotypes....who pine away for each other....for want of sex.<br/><br/>
If you are at all a fan of this era....go watch the re-release of Ziggy Stardust, or listen to lou Reed's Transformer or Berlin. Or better yet, read a book! You will learn more.<br/><br/>This movie is not just bad because of the unrelenting historical inacuracies, it's bad because it's poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted. Fundamentaly, it just plain stinks!<br/><br/>I'll give it a 2 out of ten stars simply because I finished it. I should never have rented it in the first place."
"pfgpowell-1","6","3","5","23 December 2010"," Glam, glam, glam but not much of a centre. More one for gays
","This is the second review I've written, but it won't differ essentially from what I wrote in the first, which was that Velvet Goldmine seems to me more a film for gays and something of a gay manifesto more than anything else. That is not to criticise the film particularly or to denigrate it, just to suggest that in many ways I suspect homosexual men (and perhaps women) will gain more from it than heterosexuals. And I suspect what one takes from the film will, in general, be very different depending upon one's sexual orientation. Although it was made in 1998, by which time the situation gay men and women in the Western world was somewhat easier than it had been ever before (I gather it's still pretty dire in Africa and other parts of the world), Velvet Goldmine strikes me as being a document of gay liberation presented in a manner which likes to see itself as rebellious. Perhaps that has to do with the age of the film's writer/director Todd Haynes, who has made gay proselytising his life's mission and who will have grown up when being gay was not as easy as it might be today. I am not gay, which under the circumstances, is relevant, so I think that should be taken into account in the following comments. It is difficult what to make of the film. It has been said that the central character, Brian Slade, and his career were based on David Bowie in his various incarnations, and Haynes makes a good fist of evoking the whole early Seventies glam rock scene when sexual ambiguity became for some just another fashion and a release for others. And if it is based on Bowie, who had several different pop personae just as Brian Slade had Maxwell Demon, the appearance right at the start of the film and then later on of a 'spaceship' at least has context, however spurious. But over and above that, that spaceship makes no sense and in many ways demonstrates what doesn't really work in Velvet Goldmine. There is a cryptic reference to Oscar Wilde (who was not a foundling as is suggested by the film) and some of his poetry, and some play is made of a sapphire tie pin (or something) which is said once to have belonged to Wilde and is then passed from gay character to gay character as some kind of talisman. All of this is, at worst, pretentious and, at best (which I think is a little more the case), merely rather muddled. And muddle seems to sum up Velvet Goldmine. It is patently not a fictionalised bio pic of Bowie and it is patently not just an account of the 'glam rock years'. For many minutes, interminably long minutes for this non-gay viewer, it is almost akin to gay soft porn, great for gays, I suppose, not so interesting for non-gays. For Haynes those scenes are, presumably, important for the film he is making, but in the overall arc they drag a rather. There is rather less cohesion than one would like, and, it has to be said, whether or not this is a specific gay film or even one primarily intended for a gay audience, Haynes is obliged to make a film which is, at some level, accessible to all. My problem is that there is quite a lot about Velvet Goldmine which isn't half bad, especially the performances by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Ewan McGregor (as a gay Iggy Pop type of character), Toni Collette, Eddie Izzard and Christian Bale. The pastiche glam rock songs are generally as good as the real thing, the era is evoked very well, and for stretches Velvet Goldmine is very entertaining. I should imagine it would be enjoyed especially by young lads who know they are gay but are battling with how to come out (my brother was one such, and as I love and like him a great deal, and my heart goes out to others like him who found and find themselves in that situation). In the Christian Bale character they will have a good role model. But on another level Velvet Goldmine is a confused mess, neither fish nor fowl, a film which meanders a great deal and doesn't quite make up it's mind what it is. On balance, however, I would recommend that it is worth watching, whether you are gay or straight, but don't necessarily expect to understand what the bloody hell is going on."

","This is a brilliant movie. Though it might seem like you need to be gay, bisexual, fond of scandal or a glam lover in order to enjoy it, it isn't really like that. I am none of the things above and still found this movie to be excellent. From the make up and clothes to the music and excellent performances, not a second of the movie is to be wasted. When my sister came across a VHS copy for sale and had everybody turn around to see who had died -jugding by her scream- I thought she was exaggerating. Well, she wasn't. This is one of the best movies you can ever get. And I repeat, you don't need to be gay to love it. After all, what's really beautiful about the relationship between Brian and Curt is not that they're both men, it's how much the love each other. When Brian sees Curt performing on stage for the first time, and he stares at him with such love... well, it's difficult to find a scene from any movie that beats that one. Plus, it's a celebration of color. All that glitters isn't gay, all that glitters is wonderful!"

","The 70s glam rock movement in the UK hearalded an openly gay glitter lifestyle that rocked staid Brits. Todd Haynes ode to the era of glam is not a biopic of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Instead, its the fictional story of Brian Slade (Johnathan Rhys-Myers) and Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor) who prance and vamp through hoards of groupies, hangers on, and entourages of press leaving devastation everywhere. Pretentious with attitude and posing de regeur for the era, these characters wallow in their shallowness.<br/><br/>Visual kudos for great eyemakeup for men and spandex for all. Sandy Powells outstanding designs were nominated for an Oscar for costumes. Ewan McGregor's randy performance au natural singing ""T.V. Eye"" is hot and one could easily see him turning from acting to a singing career if his voice were stronger. As an Iggy Pop-like character, McGregor inhabits Curt Wild with lust and sensuousness that makes him magnetic to watch and equally stunning in scene stealing duets with Rhys-Myers or Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Toni Collette, so heartwarming in Muriel's Wedding, is a sour, left in the dust wife, her ambition and desire for the limelight went only as far as her husband's need for a convenient beard. In the role of the singer's agent, Eddie Izzard, the fabulous executive transvestite comedian plays a straight in the film. This ode to sex, drugs, and platform shoes has several outstanding performances including Christian Bale as the reporter who investigates the WEHT faded rocker.<br/><br/>Goldmine is at times wistful yet never goes completely overboard, it is believable in its outlandish camp. The video or DVD is worth owning. I have both and the PAL-video special edition which contains minimal differences from the US and British released theatrical versions.<br/><br/>Reminder: to be played at maximum volume."
"jvframe","10","3","5","26 August 2005"," Christian Bale steals the show
","I missed all accurate hype for this film when it was released here for a brief cinema season and therefore missed the chance of seeing it on the big screen in all its glory.<br/><br/>Luckily the widescreen region 1 DVD is superb and the Dolby 5.1 audio is used to perfection. I love the whole look of this film - and especially the nuances in facial expressions and body movements.<br/><br/>Todd Haynes is 100% honest and accurate in the development of the character Arthur Stuart. We see that Arthur has taken great strength from the lyrics of his pop idols and has the guts to be proud to be gay in a world deeply mired in middle-class conservatism. I was the same age as Arthur in this era - I wore the same style of clothes and avidly listened to the same music (Bowie in my reality). Being gay I went through the same angst about how the world was going to cope with me.<br/><br/>So there's a great deal that I personally connect with - plus the bonus of a superb soundtrack and an intriguing, totally satisfying storyline. I've watched Velvet Goldmine several times and it just keeps getting better - as does my impression of Christian Bale as one truly great actor. He makes this film live. <br/><br/>Todd Haynes should also take a bow - of course he further proved his class with the equally impressive ""Far From Heaven""."
"maraki","5","3","5","29 June 2000"," not so good, not so bad
","Even if it's just for the music, you ought to see this film: If you were ever a fan of David Bowie (in his ""glam rock"" period)you'll feel as if you're stepping back in time watching this movie. It's the story of Brian Slade, a 70s pop-idol, seen through the eyes (with constant flash-backs) of a journalist who is gathering information for a story on Slade, but cannot track him down.<br/><br/>The music is great, some parts of the movie actually play like a video clip. The acting is also great, especially Ewan McGregor (as the other pop idol, Curt Wild) & Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Brian Slade. Both of them give outstanding performances.<br/><br/>But all in all I would have to say that the movie is tiring: it drags on and on, for almost 2 hours, and lots of the stuff it says could be said much quicker. But even for the music & the information on a certain era, give it a go."
"Mikelito","1","8","20","6 May 2007"," Underground schmockumentary disguised as mainstream
","This is basically a gay fantasy. Someone's wishful thinking put on film. But that is OK only for an underground movie, because the overwhelming majority of the viewing public will not accept it unless it has any sort of quality, which is clearly not the case here. <br/><br/>How can the makers of the movie actually have expected Bowie letting them use his original music? On the other hand of course he invited misinterpretations by using the taboo of bisexuality to finally get his career going. Very soon it became evident that he could have success without any manufactured scandals. But too late for sueing films like this for historical inaccuracy. Well, yer can't have yer cake and sit on it, then throw it out of the window... <br/><br/>Iggy Pop granted the use of his music, which is a shame. He of course is much less successful in terms of sales than Bowie and seeks to get his work known by any means. What a pity because he is one of the most intelligent people in the ""Rock business"". To give your work to people who waste it on their private fantasies doesn't help you at all, I think. <br/><br/>One question that bothered me throughout bearing this unfunny imitation of a Ken Russell movie was this: Do these people understand glam rock? Do they know the difference between acting androgynous and being a flaming homosexual?... Christian Bale by the way is as stony and emotionless as always. The prototype actor for a dumbed down playstation generation.<br/><br/>But the reason this movie is a complete failure is this: It's neither a documentary nor some truly original fantasy on Glam Rock. It's something in between, something which doesn't work. Reason: You cannot save yourself from coming up with a story by using 100s of actual facts from people's lives and then twist all the facts that don't suit your wishful thinking. I think that would be ""defamation"" but for reasons described above a well-deserved lawsuit didn't happen. And also because minorities are protected by the P.C. police. <br/><br/>True Schlock: the entire convoluted mess culminates in a boy-meets-boy fantasy on a rooftop. This is incoherent propaganda that doesn't quite know what it wants or how to get there. This is Rainer Werner Fassbinder at his amateurish worst. But he was probably too intelligent to produce nonsense like this.<br/><br/>Lastly I find Biopics awful - they should only be made of people who have been dead for decades so there are less people who actually remember them. Biopics are made by boring people with no ideas for people who want some fast food information about things they don't care to investigate themselves."

","If the writer/director of this film is misunderstood he has only himself to blame. He could have included a resolved plot in his script - I mean all that cash from the producers to make a name for yourself, and this is what you come up with - please! The main characters are so obviously based on Bowie, Pop and DeVries that they cannot be parody. So is it a ""rockumentary""? Well - no. Because it uses fantasy to portray its..er..message? Unfortunately there is no message - except perhaps some sort of dig at Slade/Bowie for reinventing himself and using ideas from others. So what's controversial about that? So is it attempting to give a taste and feel of the UK glam-rock era to those who were not there? Slightly unfortunate then that the writer/director was about 11 years old and living in the States at the time. All in all a clumsy, cliched, camp attempt - the cinematography looked like a school play. I've already forgotten the leading performances. Probably be a guarantee of cult obscurity for Rhys Meyers - poor chap."
"RaeganBeaumont_99","8","4","8","24 July 2006"," An Unforgettable Movie
","Well I would have to say that if nothing else it was unforgettable, Brian was a talented guy who saw something in Curt he wanted to find, something he desired that was obvious from the moment he first saw him in the park concert. His wife i think he did once upon a time have a deep affection for whether it was love or not thats hard to say. I think as he got bigger and more famous he lost track of feelings and was true to no one but himself, i do however think he did love Curt as he wanted to work with him and have him be apart of his life and music, but i think that his manager and others around made him see things different, i also don't think when it came to his career he always thought of himself as much as he let people pull him along with what they wanted him to be. Turning him into something cold and unfeeling as it went along, i think when Curt left he just got colder and unfeeling inside not caring about anyone anymore other than what he wanted, what he could have and what was available to him. As for Authur i think he was all gone over Curt, and i think he might have given Curt some real connection as far as just being with him and not a star, he saw him as he was in front of him. and Authur was infatuated with both men i think. You could see that from his scene in his room(when he got caught) It was a bright, musical movie with a lot of movement. It was creative and not dull at all. I'm not much of Christian Bale fan, i don't care for him in nothing he's in, hes the same in every movie its like you can see that hes acting. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was great in this movie, from everything he did to every new look he held, their were moments when he was even beautiful.. and he came across wonderfully. Ewan McGregor i don't think i will ever see the same. It was stunning and shocking at time, he did however a brilliant job as showing us his emotions and the personality of his character. Altho it was an odd movie it was engrossing and interesting to see. His wife however i felt bad for she loved him unconditionally and got treated like crap, she was tossed out and thrown aside like she was nothing. It was sad to see that, Toni Collete did an awesome job though. If you want to see a movie that different, i would say watch this one. And i don't think as much as it would be great to see Brian and Curt together, they are two people who even may have loved one another wouldn't have been good for one another. They were my fav couple out of the men of course."

","This movie is one of the loveliest I've ever seen, worthwhile simply for the gorgeous costumes, the camera work and the wonderfully conceived musical sequences.<br/><br/>The script meanders and leaves many open questions, but that's not a problem for me. Like a David Lynch movie, it only made me want to give the film repeated viewings to find nuances I'd missed before.<br/><br/>As a gay themed movie, this benefits by comparison to the terribly cliched, dull gay movies that gay people are more or less forced to sit through. There are drag queens and some gratuitous nudity, but nobody comes out to disco music, it doesn't burden itself with politics, and you can actually spot human attractions in people instead of the typical: you're attractive, I'm attractive, let's call it love and make a movie of it.<br/><br/>This deserves a better rating than 6 out of 10; I think some people were distracted by the barbie dolls and the confusing script. I hope people give movies like this a chance; otherwise the best gay movies we're going to see will be in the order of The Broken Hearts Club or Jeffrey."

","This was supposed to be about the sexual confusion of the 1970s ""Glam Rock"" era in Britain & followed the central character's exploration of his bisexuality, which was fashionable at the time amongst those who could afford the lifestyle.<br/><br/>But this story is just a mess, hampered by trying to copy real life people (Bowie & Iggy Pop etc) without straying so close as to risk being sued. It also means that the essential sounds of that time are missing too, as no 70s Glam Rock tracks are included. Instead we get neutered pastiche noises, which lacks everything about what made Glam Rock tracks ROCK in the first place.<br/><br/>The same goes for the story, as it bobs & weaves from here to there in a seemingly aimless manner & the few plot lines that emerge never gel. I get the impression that the writers suddenly found themselves, late in the day, with large sections of their work being shredded due to legal implications & they had to rescue it somehow. The results should have been consigned to the bin as well & we could all have gained from having something decent released instead.<br/><br/>This is a shame, this is the first lame duck I have ever come across from Channel 4 films, as they have always succeeded before. While this should be something to envy, for small production houses like this it can be very dangerous, as Hand Made Films found out to their cost! One flop broke them, despite all their previous successes.<br/><br/>You may like it, but in essence it does little to explain the 1970s Glam Rock era, as it claims to do. If you weren't there at the time, you may find something in it. But for those of us who were, it looks about as convincing as a Ziggue-Ziggue-Sputnick ""performance""."

","The premise of this movie reads better than the final visual outcome. Cultists will love it (they can excuse almost anything) but the end result tells us more about the film-maker than it does the Glam/Glitter rock era. From a very interesting opening (if a bit odd) and a couple of well staged scenes - it rapidly sinks into a sludge. Overloaded with repugnant themes and characters - it's not surprising so many from this era did not make it past age 40 (if they were so lucky), it sits well as an illustration of the walking dead - join them at your own peril.<br/><br/>I can fully appreciate why David Bowie disliked the script so much - in fact, so much that he would not let any of his original tracks be used within this grotesque production. The best song is kept for the end "" Make Me Smile"" by Steve Harley but, this is only played over the end credits and, the end credits come one and a half hours too late...If you know how to value your head space then for Gods sake, keep this slosh well away from it!"

Some simply won't get it, but if you look at the stars and see possibility, hunger after a moment in the limelight and the chance to brush up against something weird, mysterious and wonderful, just for a moment...then this movie is meant for you.<br/><br/>I came into the world too late for the actual age of glam...it was all over long before I got there, but Arthur (Christian Bale) remains a strange parallel to my own memories of coming of age, coming out, and falling in love with and deep into a music scene that altered and enriched my life with experiences that might never have been had elsewhere. The soundtrack of my life might have played a bit differently, but the altrock/goth/industrial/punks at the end of the 80s and dawn of the 90s had their outrageous characters, and the descendants from glam rock were present in the pageantry and showmanship, the fabulous and the profane...so like the emerald brooch...the torch had been passed person to person, era to era, artist to artist...until something like that moment of wonder impacted against my life too.<br/><br/>So when I watch this movie, despite loving the references to stars of the 70s punk and glam scenes, and enjoying the music and costumes and characters immensely, my attention always returns to Arthur Stuart, who also brushed against something powerful, wonderful, dangerous and strangely sacred for just a little while...and has never been the same since. Enjoy it...it's a fine film, well shot and with superb acting...but if I can add one other piece of advice...get out there and brush up against something wonderful of your own."

This movie feels almost like reading a chapter from that book. Bowie is a creation built from the outside in. If I squint a little and doze off slightly watching this film, the correspondence to the preposterous truth and emphatic construction of a faÃ§ade in the film is just about right. There are videos on YouTube of Bowie interviews which are as much performances as this portrayal. Many details seem to be directly out of the record including the styles of music managers and their demands on venues.

Both Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys Myers are excellent in their gender-twisting roles. The examination of the relationship between gender, sex, and emotion is very well crafted. Toni Collette is excellent as always, as the wife who moves through a range of emotions and roles from supportive to jealous to accepting to dealing with loss.

There are those of us who love it - and those who despise it.<br/><br/>Those who love it tend to be fascinated by the beauty of the film as much as by the story. For me, the splendid visuals are only part of the attraction. The real magic of this film comes from the hundreds of cultural references hidden throughout it. As an avid student of both Wilde and Bowie it feels as though this film was made especially for me. It isn't very often that a movie rewards you for being literate.<br/><br/>Those who hate the film usually cite the complex and admittedly hard to follow plot which moves back and forth through time, and passes between several narrators. There are certain types of viewers who need to have things spelled out for them in a linear, easy to follow, fashion - this isn't the film for them.<br/><br/>The other complaint that I hear regularly is that it is an inaccurate biography of David Bowie. I think that the mistake they're making is in expecting a biography. Velvet Goldmine is about Bowie in much the same way that Citizen Kane is about William Randolph Hearst. This isn't a film about the real David Bowie - it is a film about what Bowie symbolized, its about his archetype."

I love the music, costumes, screenplay, story, actors, etc. There are just a few things that bug me about it.<br/><br/>First of all, the whole UFO Oscar Wilde thing is stupid. It really detracts from the story. Can't we celebrate an extraordinary talent without assuming that it had to come from outer space? And even if one wants to play along with that, then how do they all know where the pin came from, since Jack Fairy dug it out of the pavement? Second, they build us all up with the ""rule the whole stinkin world"" comment in the beginning, and Jack Fairy hardly turns out that way. The kids even comment ""who's Jack Fairy?"" when one of them points him out on the street.<br/><br/>Next, how did Brian and company go from sleeping in the park one minute to a slick, expensive MTV-looking music video to pitch to industry executives what seems like the next day? Did they cut a bunch of scenes? Don't get me wrong: awesome video! But very 80s looking, and totally out of nowhere. Nobody ever produced anything like that in the early 70s.<br/><br/>Finally, the reporter (Christian Bale) suddenly realizes who Brian Slade had turned into because he sees that mousy little assistant, but his only knowledge of her was through other people's eyewitness accounts. How could he possibly know what she looked like? Dumb.<br/><br/>Annoyances aside, I really love this movie."

","This cult-classic was amazingly well-done. It flowed through with several references to Bowie, which enhanced the movie. There were countless fun surprises throughout the film. Kudos Todd! (I especially like the graphics that show up in Brian and his manager's eyes when Curt decides to join them. This almost hypnotizing film is great to watch when you need to relax. It puts you in a trance, I swear. Wonderfully done! Although it is a little confusing at first, and even after the fifth viewing I learn new things about the characters, or notice something that I didn't see before. It is perhaps one of the those movies to watch for the first time with a friend who's seen it before. Well, with nothing else to say, go see it!"
"nalbrigh","9","2","3","7 February 2004"," Not just fantasy (Spoilers!)
","I love this movie - I've seen it some 15 times and just got the DVD.  I think it has some of the most erotically charged musical performances on film.  This film captures the sexiness of not only glam rock, but the hard-edged proto-punk style of the Stooges that influenced it.  In very clever ways, this movie references the real people, music, style, and politics of the mid-70s.  In addition to that, it weaves together themes of social isolation, discontent, and disruption, as well as time, memory, and ""history"" which is always ""the fiction of empires"".  Using the work of Oscar Wilde was particularly effective, because Wilde fashioned himself an artist and asthete above all, and a social critic, but not a liberal in any modern day sense.  The characters (and their real life counterparts) likewise seek to change the world merely by challenging the norms while looking fabulous. Nice work if you can get it.<br/><br/>But most people here seem to miss out on the obvious conclusions of this film!  *Brian Slade is Tommy Stone*, that is, it indicts David Bowie for selling out, renouncing his bisexual past, and becoming more mainstream in the 80s.  Meanwhile, the culture as a whole lost its zing, got homogenized, and the postmodern revolution came to a grinding halt.  Not the least element in this is the not-so-subtle jab at ""President Reynolds"".. gee, I wonder who that is.  Personally, I don't agree that the 80s signaled a complete collapse.  The pendulum did swing to the right a bit, but then that's to be expected.  And the new wave pop of the 80s never would have happened without glam and punk.  A good deal of 80s pop was made by openly gay artists about openly gay themes as well.<br/><br/>Two things in this movie stand out at me as odd. First, MacGreggors's Curt Wild is a dead ringer for Kurt Cobain.  It's downright creepy in the scenes where his hair is blonde.  I have to wonder if this was intentional.  If so, I can certainly see how 90s grunge was at least in part a descendent of the same musical trends, and some of the social trends.  Punk, glam, and many of their relatives are based around rock music as simply a middle finger. Grunge certainly fit into that.  Kurt Cobain was known to wear a wedding dress at some of his performances, strictly as a joke.  Anyone who doesn't get the point of simply being outrageous in relatively harmless ways is a member of the establishment, spiritually if not physically.  They're part of the problem.<br/><br/>The second thing, and the only serious screw-up in the movie that I see is that in order to come to his big epiphany, Stuart recognizes Stone's press secretary on television as the wardrobe mistress to Brian Slade, even though he only knows about this person through Mandy Slade's flashback as recounted to him.  It's never established how he could have recognized this person. The point is made clear to the viewer, but within the film it's a pretty big plot hole.<br/><br/>Everything else that seems too fantastical, or non-sensical, is just playing with memory.  Did Stuart and Wild really hook up?  I don't think it's important.  I think the idea is that as we fetishize a past that cannot be retrieved and perhaps never really existed, we want to insert ourselves into it.  The minute a social trend becomes recognizable, it has ceased to be original and rebellious, and will imminently be co-opted and mainstreamed. Maybe the creators of ""glam rock"" knew that better than anyone and, as suggested in the film, pulled the plug before it became trite.<br/><br/>
At least it finally became cool again to be bisexual.  And we don't have to wear eyeliner and feathers to do it."

","Honestly, I dont quite understand why some people would expect any 'accuracy' of the era - be it the characters, the music, the plot, or anything whatsoever - in the movie. I think it'd be fair to view this movie just as a movie - as if you dont know anything about David Bowie or Iggy Pop or any other rock stars. It's a work of imagination, of fantasy, of a mixture of love and hate, of admiration and scorn. And when it comes to the plot - Does it really matter whether the reporter finds what he sets out to find towards the end? Is the main thing the outcome or the process - where does the essence of the era lie - if you think about it? A dream that is forever gone - partly unfulfilled, never completely real - glitters across your mind. I'd recommend this movie to those who enjoy a movie dazzles with its beauty (the customes, the music, the atmosphere - you know you adore that vanity) and the expression of its ideas (leave this movie alone if you cant do without a conventional plotline). Keep an open mind for this."
"modern_maiden","8","2","3","1 April 2003"," A titillating pan-gender adventure!
","Forget the comparisons between the film's characters and Iggy Pop and David Bowie. The irony that some viewers have missed, is that the film itself echoes its own message, daringly stealing the images of retro pop idols and re-inventing them as its own original creations. <br/><br/>This film is like a dream of an intergalactic cabaret whorehouse on Hallowe'en...except it's actually the early 1970s, and it's about young Earthlings in Manchester making music and living free. It's a story of a desperate need for identity, interlaced with a driven desire of self-expression and hedonism.<br/><br/>""Velvet Goldmine"" is lush, colourful and could be decribed as vaguely disturbing eye candy. Much of it is a barrage of music, costumes and glitter, presented in a way that blends modern music video with retro investigative reporting. <br/><br/>The actors are all superb. Ewan McGregor is excellent as the tormented Curt Wild -- really outstanding, mesmerising in fact. Johnathan Rhys-Myers is the perfect Brian Slade, a bisexual image-obsessed glam rock star whose rise to fame and fall from glory is being revisited by a young journalist played by Christian Bale. Toni Colette has come a long way from ""Muriel's Wedding"" as Slade's glamour-queen wife, expertly dropping in and out of American and English dialect as the situation requires.<br/><br/>I certainly envy the actors for being able to live out their rock star fantasies in this film, and to wear the most fabulously glitzy costumes throughout. Hats off to Todd Haynes for creating a rich fantasy that is close enough to reality to be all that much more fascinating."
"humanresistor","6","2","3","5 July 2002"," Fundamentally flawed with a few worthwhile parts.
","There's nothing in ""Velvet Goldmine"" that can really make up for the fact that Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' performances are well below par.  They never really seem convincing or even genuinely interested in their parts.<br/><br/>When the movie moves away from its main characters it tends to succeed more, but although some of the supporting actors are excellent (especially Toni Collette), obviously there's only so much they can offer.  The newly-recorded music is lukewarm (I looked at the names in the credits and marvelled at how they produced such uninteresting work - it's remarkable just how much the film perks up when the 'real' versions of ""Virginia Plain"" and ""Satellite of Love"" are playing) and, overall, the movie does a very poor job of evoking 1974 or indeed 1984.  A completely missed opportunity."

","I don't know what it is about ""Velvet Goldmine"", but since the moment I first saw it I've been captivated and stricken by it.  It goes beyond the glitter and its amazing visual look.  There's something so human about this movie, I believe it has some sort of spectacular meaning under the surface that's not able to be decoded.<br/><br/>""Velvet Goldmine"" is simply put, my favourite film of all time.  It's not superficial as it first may seem, and it's not pretentious either.  There's something universal about it that is shown through the characters and their inner-struggles.  The whole atmosphere of this film is surreal and everything that goes on in the movie I've noticed a strong emotional attachement to.  Todd Haynes quite possibly could have made one of the most underrappreciated and truthful films of all time."
"OzK","Null","2","3","14 July 1999"," An extraordinary film that should be viewed on its own merits
","While I'm old enough to remember the Glam Rock era as it played out in Australia, I was never a part of it, barely remember the music, vaguely recall the names of the groups and solo artists of the time. I came to this film via Phantom Menace, because I'd hardly seen anything of Ewan McGregor's work and was curious.<br/><br/>As a result, I came into this film with no background info, no preconceptions or preconceived ideas as to who these people were (or apparently were supposed to be) or what was going on. I think that was a good thing, because it seems to me that a great many people came to this film with an enormous amount of baggage ... and it's baggage that I think got in the way of appreciating Velvet Goldmine for itself.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I think this is a love story. Love of self, love of someone else, of fame and money and lifestyle and drugs and music. It's also about lack of love, and the damage that can inflict.<br/><br/>This isn't a conventional 'Hollywood' kind of film. Its construction is non-linear, it forces the viewer to work at understanding what's going on, doesn't give all the answers, leaves spaces for interpretation. It makes you think ... and perhaps, even more confronting, it makes you feel.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that perhaps a reason for the strong reactions to this film is that it challenges on a deeply personal level. There is enormous pain in Velvet Goldmine, and it's exposed in a particularly raw way. Perhaps some of the negativity towards it is less about the film, and more about the way it stirs up emotions in the viewer.<br/><br/>With the possible exception of Eddie Izzard's Manager, there are no out and out villains in this film. Not even Brian ... especially not Brian, since he's the biggest victim of all, in the end. Instead it's full of people who are struggling to find love, self acceptance, a place in the world where they can be themselves. Most poignant of all is Arthur, whose sexual confusion and struggle to find a meaningful identity is almost too excruciating to bear in some scenes. But equally successful is the portrayal of his parents, who are so clearly bewildered and confused  by their son and the world in which they find themselves raising him.<br/><br/>For me there are 2 standout moments in Velvet Goldmine. The first is Brian's first manager's line to Arthur: 'Brian was elegance walking arm in arm with a lie'. That line gives me shivers, it's so perfect. The second is Curt's performance at the Death of Glam concert, where he is shrieking his pain and anger in an orgy of private suffering, oblivious to the audience, just pouring out waves and waves of pain ... and then when he comes off stage and collides with Mandy and they're both crying because they are the only 2 people who know how much it hurts to love Brian Slade.<br/><br/>The emotional power of this film is amazing. Comment has been made regarding Myers' performance as Brian Slade, that  he's cold and distant and uninvolving ... well, I kind of think that was the point. At the end of the day, Brian Slade loves only himself. Everywhere he goes, people fall in love with him, are wrecked by their love for him ... he just leaves them in his wake, uncaring. He may very well feel something for Mandy, for Curt ... but what he feels for himself will always take precedence. And yet somewhere deep inside there's a part of him that doesn't want to be like that ... that wants to escape, love ... it just doesn't work out.<br/><br/>All the performances in this film are excellent (yay Toni Collette!) but again McGregor is the standout. He has the most amazing willingness to be naked (not like that! Well, okay, not only like that ...;), to expose the private pain and vulnerabilities of a character without thought or care for how 'unmasculine' that might make him. God bless him for that. He is a true actor, unlike so many psuedoperformers out there who have the emotional depth and honesty of a tree.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and have a look at this film. And if you are a graduate of the Glam Rock era, check all that baggage at the door"

","Velvet Goldmine is one of the better movies I have seen in quite some time. The director, Todd Haynes, has an interesting, moody style similar to that of High Art.  It took me a bit to fall into the movie because the pacing threw me, but after I adjusted I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.  If you like music and the glam-rock lifestyle you will probably enjoy this movie. Some of my friends disagree but I can definitely see a little David Bowie, Mick Jagger and Robert Smith (look hard) in the main character Brian Slade. If you have an aversion to long musical cuts in film this may not be something you would enjoy.  If your 420 compatible you could definitely find a lot in this movie."

Forget the gay references, just enjoy the beautiful music, costumes and delicious beautiful Jonathan Rhys Jones (WHERE has he been? Move over Brad Pitt), and enjoy.

While I never got into the glam scene (too young), I like some of the music that came out of it. It was a beautifully directed film with numerous subplots that actually worked with each other.  Done in a sort of 'cut-up' style, it may lose some people.  The homosexual aspects may bother others.  If so, wake up!  This is the nineties, and it's a film about the seventies.

","""For once there was an unknown land, full of strange flowers and subtle perfumes, a land of which it is joy of all joys to dream, a land where all things are perfect and poisonous. "" This is the setting.  The movie is Velvet Goldmine and the time period is the 70's Glam rock era of England. Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), a journalist, is sent out with an assignment to write an anniversary article on the staged assassination of glitter rock divinity Brian Slade (Jonathon Rhys Meyers).  He reluctantly takes the assignment and begins to investigate his fallen lipsticked idol.  This Todd Haynes film is like nothing ever seen before and in the end, like nothing it appears. Like a grand masterpiece, this film depends upon a layering of plots to create a multi-dimensional effect.  At the center of it all, is the story of Arthur, a reporter who moves to America to forget his past, only to unleash these long-buried memories while investigating the Brian Slade story. Through flashbacks, we observe Arthur's early life in England, his discovery of glitter rock, and his attempts to hide his obsession from his family. By way of a Citizen Kane interview technique, we witness the story of Brian Slade as told by his ex-manager, Cecil Drake, and his ex-wife, Mandy Slade (Toni Collete) from the birth to the fall of the star.  Sliced into such scenes are elements of glamour and fantasy, as well as the public's views via newspaper articles and television reports.  Then there are the music videos that parelell the ongoing story.  Providing a smooth transition between sharply cut components is strange poetry, flashy quotes, Barbie doll love scenes, Oscar Wilde's fall to earth, and other strange takes on reality. In chessboard fashion, the glitter pawns remain as vital to the game as the queens and the pieces work together as a well-oiled machine.  Bisexual alien rock messiah Brian Slade provides the easiest draw to real life glitter rock.  From his hippie folk comeuppance to his Venusian persona Maxwell Demon, Brian is more David Bowie than Bowie himself.  Throughout the movie we are kept at a painful emotional distance from Slade. However, it is not only essential to the way the story is told, but it keeps the focus on the history of glam. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, perhaps more lip model than actor, gives us the perfect pout, tort reply, and doe-eyed look of a pop icon. Curt Wild, a mess of uniquely American glitterology, is nine-tenths Iggy Pop from his physique to his songs to his trailer-trash, Michigan backwoods past.  The rest comes from a combination of Lou Reed and Mick Ronson. Ewan McGregor, though not as thin as Iggy, captures the drug worn, confused rocker perfectly.  From dutiful wife to tell-all ex, Mandy Slade performs a vital part in the tale.  Based on Angela Bowie, Mandy masks her intelligence by outrageousness.  As annoying as she may be, she and Brian do make the ideal Barbie and Ken of androgyny.  Toni Collete provides a pleasant rendition of ""wan and wasted.""  Arthur Stuart, the glitter pop fan in all of us, is lost in the gender-bending, camp attack on rock and roll.  He is not pretty, not special, and not based on anyone in particular.  He just serves as the vehicle for the audience to see the story.  Christian Bale does not provide a flashy or over the top performance, but then again he isn't meant to.  Then, there is Jack Fairy, a strange brew, who has no real purpose but to appear at key moments during the film and act cool.  His trash-meets-glamour aura borrows from Bryan Ferry and Brian Eno, but he is more fairytale than factual history.  He is simply the patron saint of all that is camp. Reality is not in things but in between them, and Velvet Goldmine wavers heavily between glam reality and glam fiction.  The David Bowie references seem to stand on the most solid ground.  Like Brian Slade, Bowie actually went from Mod, to folk artist, to space age rocker, to fallen cocaine addict, to bleach blonde pop sellout.  He was influenced by Little Richard and experimented with every aspect of his life.  Both Brian Eno and Iggy Pop left the rock world for Berlin's cold dream-like techno as did Curt Wild and Jack Fairy.  The use of stage names and even the album covers and music videos parallel real life glam.  However, there are some differences. Unlike Slade's persona Maxwell Demon, Bowie's Ziggy Stardust never faked an assassination.  Bowie never dropped out of the public or changed his name, whereas Slade disappeared and then reemerged as Tommy Stone. And despite what the film indicated, Bowie and Iggy's relationship did not end.  In fact, they lived together in Berlin for a long period at the end of the seventies.  There are also some events in the movie that still remain a mystery in real life.  Did Bowie really have a relationship with Iggy Pop? Or Lou Reed? Or Mick Ronson?  Was Oscar Wilde really an alien?  To experience the full effect of Velvet Goldmine, we must never know.  So close your eyes. Take a little trip. And behold a rhapsody divine."

","I went to the premier at the New York Film Festival last week and all I can say is one word: amazing. This film is a pure, sublime trip of an experience with brilliant music that literally makes you rise from your seat and dance. Granted, the actors do not chew up the scenery--the scenery chews up the scenery--yet this doesn't detract from the strong performances from all of the key players involved. The arc of the narrative is somewhat complex--but refreshingly so as the concentric plots and characters interwoven create a unique tapestry of sound and beauty, the likes of which have never been committed to a fall release/art movie before (or any movie in general for that matter).<br/><br/>Unfortunately some people will be turned off by the profound gay content (as demonstrated by the other reviews on this site)-- but then again some people will always be turned off by anything that deals bluntly with alternate sexuality.<br/><br/>Anyone who is a fan of movies and music will be moved by this film on some level--it is empirically fascinating and not elitist in its intellectualism or ideas in the least bit--in fact it works on a pristine visceral level, where the images and sounds not only provide a running commentary on protean identity, but also fetishize and celebrate self-empowerment through baroque posturing and charade--the point being, paradoxically, that we never know our icons (whomever they may be) even though they ultimately help us come to understand ourselves and our place in the world."

","Who would have thought that glam rock was an otherworldly descendant of Oscar Wilde? Well I think most anyone that has seen a performance but never thought about it consciously.  This ""obvious"" idea was captured by Todd Haymes who wrote and directed Velvet Goldmine.  The story borrows elements from Oscar Wilde, Citizen Kane, pop icons that resemble David Bowie and Iggy Pop, and quasi-premise of the B movie, Eddie and Cruisers.  All this mells into a surreal story of love and fame.  I will not be specific in telling the story but if you find androgyny and bisexuality offensive don't see this movie, but that would be to pigeonhole this film unfairly. The story is told thru Arthur (Christian Bale) who is an investigative reporter looking for a glam rocker, Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who has disappear- ed.  In his search he finds Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor) also a rocker but also Slade's inspiration, friend, and former lover.  All the performers were excellent. They showed great versatilty in that it traces their lives from the teenage years with the turmoil of maturing and sexuality to midde age.  I was also impressed that both Mr. McGregor and Mr. Myers did many of their own vocals.  The story also cunningly weaves the story of the reporter in with that of the two protagonists.  As a person old enough to remember the glam rock era, this movie portrays well and captures the feeling of that time.  It does so with fantastic costuming and cinematography as honest believable charac ters.  Velvet Goldmine is great entertainment I will hope and look for much more from Mr. McGregor who if they ever do the story of Kurt Cobain he should star as I could not help but see a striking resemblance as well as Mr. Rhys-Meyes, and Mr. Bales.  All were EXCELLENT.  Three and a half stars!"

At the same time it was entertaining to see who his caricatures represented.  Constant speculations arose of a caped ""Eno?"", a rowdy ""Bolan?"", and the tough girl ""Suzie Quatro?"".<br/><br/>My one complaint about the film would be Ewan McGregor.

The film's serious and emotional treatment of same sex love is to be commended. The relationship between Brian Slade and Curt Wild is portrayed as a real relationship, not some freakish, lustdriven affair. And the portrayal of gay teenager Arthur Stuart by Christian Bale is at times moving and painful in its honesty. And Toni Collete portrays the highs and lows of the high life with strength and quiet dignity that threatens to crack.<br/><br/>It's unfair to say this movie has no plot, now that I think about it.

","Velvet Goldmine should not be viewed (and reviewed)solely as a Ziggy Stardust film -- it's not; it's a parable, and like all parables, it is open to more than one interpretation.  What is sad, viewing the comments here, is the number of reviewers who have commented on the film's ""homosexuality,"" as if there were nothing else in the film, or at least no other sexuality. Glam Rock made BIsexuality ""fashionable"" (here in the States, at least), and only one of the many characters in the film (including Oscar Wilde) might be clinically viewed as being ""homosexual"" (whatever THAT means);  the main characters are exploring ALL aspects of their lives, including their sexuality, and most of them have both male and female partners, sometimes together.  To obsess about a male-male or female-female scene between any two given characters at any one point of the film is to miss the whole theme of growth and personal development -- INESCAPABLE personal development, says our reviewer -- which runs through Velvet Goldmine.<br/><br/>An alchemical transformation occurs to the personae of all of the main characters; fixating on the single theme of same-gender sexuality ignores everything which happens to the characters before or after their same-sex encounters.<br/><br/>Velvet Goldmine shows us Glam Rock as one type of catalyst which changed the lives of the people who lived through it in the early 1970's; Disco was the catalytic force of the late '70s and early '80s.  (One wonders what the future will identify as the catalyst of the 1990's -- Bill Clinton's sex life being discussed during dinner hour newscasts, perhaps?)"

The characters are amalgamations of real life glam/punk rockers, so don't take them to be any literal interpretations.  All in all, this movie sort of reminded me or The Great Rock and Roll Swindle, the rockumentary about the Sex Pistols.  The Bowie-esque character Brian Slade is played by someone I think may be the most beautiful boy I've ever seen, his name is Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and he alone is worth checking out.  This movie is truly out there and is not at all made in a typical movie fashion but very interesting, sort of like a long glam rock video.  If you're homophobic, you won't like this film, because it truly explores the homo-erotic, androgynous world of glam.  What else can I say?  The music was so wonderfully melancholy, I just can't get it out of my head.  Again, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was so beautiful, that mouth, oh that mouth.  So, if you're close-minded or looking for a serious documentary, don't go see this movie, but if you love glam, or are a fan of the alternative type of movie (and lifestyle), see this film!

I found Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Ewan McGregor completely believable in their roles, and Christian Bale gave his character a poignance and a strength that was quite powerful. Rhys Meyers, though, I must single out, because he gave Brian Slade just enough vulnerability to be sympathetic while remaining enigmatic. It's a difficult role for anyone to pull off, and given Rhys Meyers' youth and handful of credits, I found myself impressed with how well he did. Given its non-traditional storytelling, its sexual themes, and its colorful style, I don't expect this to be a popular film, but to anyone who liked it, I recommend seeing it again. I enjoyed it even more second time round."

"kaylee","8","2","3","14 November 1998"," A zany, over-the-top, fun-filled tribute to GLAM
","Interestingly enough, early 70s glam rock never took hold in the United States to the degree that the late 70s punk rock scene did.  I attribute this phenomenon to our culture's discomfort with sexuality, versus the ease with which it embraces violence.  Be that as it may, ""Velvet Goldmine"" was a raucous journey back to a genre of explosive artist creativity, and its subsequent experimentation with sexual ambiguity.  This movie celebrates the artistic and cultural boundary-pushers of the British Glam rock era.<br/><br/>The script is not constrained by some vanilla-flavored formula,  but rather multi-layered and rich.  There were at least 4 or 5 stories going on, as each character described their own memories of life with the ficticious David Bowie-esque singer, Brian Slade, and the British Glam Rock scene. Frankly, I hoped it would be even more over-the-top and surreal, but I was not disappointed in any case.<br/><br/>Of course the actor portraying Brian Slade studied and successfully reproduced many of Bowie's signature poses and postures, but the audience should not be tricked into believing this is a biography ABOUT Bowie. Another major character not to be confused with the real thing is Curt Wild, as portrayed by Ewan McGregor.  While McGregor does not look a thing like Iggy Pop (not skinny enough), his portrayal of Curt Wild was amazing because he really had Iggy's contorted moves down pat.<br/><br/>As to the scenes of untraditional sexual situations (i.e. orgies and same-sex encounters), perhaps it is valuable to remember that the director's tongue-in-cheek attitude toward the majority of the script probably applies to those scenes as well.  I am SURE it applied to the outrageously funny scene with the lizard-man and the inflatable dolls!<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, I give ""Velvet Goldmine"" an 8."

This and ""Safe"" and ""Poison"" (haven't seen ""Superstar"" but would love to I could only find it!) they are all infuriating in some ways to some people but I, for one, am so relieved that there's no pandering to the audience. I like being challenged and seeing things in new ways. His non-linear and visual approach to storytelling worked for me.<br/><br/>Loved Toni Collette's performance (very Liza-esque in the early 70's scenes which was a nice touch) I heard some griping about her accent on the way out of the theater but I thought the wavering accent was part of the point of her character. American poseur with faux accent in early scenes -gradually gets more American as she retreats from the scene but because of the repeated jumping and flip flopping about in time -it could appear to some that she couldn't maintain the accent. I think I'm in love with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. He floored me. My eyes were doing that heart thing his did onscreen.<br/><br/>My only gripe about the movie is that it seemed to have about 6 endings.

","This movie is set in the glam period of rock, and is really the first movie ever to do this. The characters are loosely based on figures david bowie, his once wife, and mick jagger/iggy pop type character. While david bowie wasn't involved in the movie (although the director asked him to be, and said he read and approved of the script) it has always been believed that david bowie had an affair with another major rock star - just like the characters in this story do. While this movie is about the characters of this time, it also portrays the fans of this time through christan bale, a sexually confused teenager during the glam rock period who goes back to revisit his past 10 years later to do a retrospective journalism article. This movie is full of sex and drugs, but as far as gay sex scenes go, this movie has one of the best. It is not totally overdone as so many are, but is quite tasteful. The best things about this film though are the costumes and soundtrack. Both old and new music (specially made for the film) are used. The director enlisted the help of some of the period's stars to make this film, such as iggy pop and brian ferry, so the periods portrayal wasn't solely fiction.

","Todd Haynes' latest creation is very impressive in its imagination and complexity.  While the events and characters are very close to the originals, it is not a biography of the times; instead managing to make us question what is real, and what was only ever made up, much in the way that the original glam era did.<br/><br/>While some people may dislike it (such as the reviewer before me) and see it as a threat and possibly a misrepresentation of the time, it seems to be more an extension of the idea, and does not imply anything more about the major glam rock players' lives than what is already known.<br/><br/>The performances from all the cast are impressive, and you can see that they threw their hearts and souls into the film.  While Toni Collette, Ewan McGregor, Eddie Izzard and Christian Bale's parts are all outstanding, they are not quite as impressive as Jonathon Rhys Meyer's Brian Slade who manages to epitomise both the fragility and illusion of the era.  This is all the more remarkable as he was only 19 at the time of filming.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also excellent, mainly helped by Michal Stipe of REM being the Executive Producer.  As well as using some of the original music from the era new songs and covers were recorded by such notables as Pulp, Grant Lee Buffalo, Shudder to Think as well as various members of bands as diverse as Radiohead, Sonic Youth and the Stooges.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fabulous film, though it may leave you questioning the nature of reality a little, it achieves exactly what it sets out to do, whatever that may be to you."

Our intrepid reporter revisits some demons from his own youth as a groupie on this scene, of his family's inability to understand him and his uncertainty about his own sexuality. Toni Collette acquits herself very well, within the limitations of her script as the decadent rock star's American wife, stoically enduring her husband's peccadilloes until the very end.

Ewan Macgregor's Curt Wild is powerful, heartbreaking and (not coincidentally) has an eerie resemblance to Kurt Cobain which brings the film home to a generation more familiar with grunge than glam.

"vivgeo","Null","2","3","2 August 1999"," thinly disguised account of Bowie/Iggy romance
","Well, I meant to see Velvet Goldmine on the big screen when it came out, but I never got around to it. And now I am really sorry, because it obviously would have been even BETTER on the big screen and in surround sound. But what REALLY got me was the story. It's a thinly disguised (very thinly -- for Iggy fans, Bowie fans, or fans of both -- and speculative by necessity) story of the David Bowie/Iggy Pop collaboration which resulted in Bowie producing some Iggy stuff (and rather poorly, I might add; the mix on some of Iggy's best songs, like Funtime, is horribly muddy) and the cross-pollination of their musical talents (songs such as Red Money by Bowie and Sister Midnight by Iggy are note for note exactly the same; only the lyrics change, though Bowie does not credit Iggy on his Lodger album). What this movie explores is what may have gone on *besides* the musical collaboration, which I always wondered about. After all, there was that one famous (infamous) Mick Rock photo of Bowie and Lou Reed leaning across Mick Jagger for a sloppy wet kiss at the table of some cafe or club... So I figured something went on between Iggy and Bowie, but I never read far enough into the Iggy or Bowie literature to find out. From what I *have* read over the years in magazines like Rolling Stone and Creem (okay, showing my age), neither of them would talk about the other. So that aspect of the film certainly seems accurate.<br/><br/>I've been wondering why Ewan McGregor was supposed to be such a big deal -- I mean, he seemed a serviceable actor, from what I had seen in Trainspotting; Phantom Menace, I'm afraid, made everyone too wooden to make McGregor stand out at all, to me. BUT having now seen Velvet Goldmine, I now know what was the big deal about Ewan McGregor. Man, can he act. He *became* Iggy in the live concert sequences -- I was astonished. (I've seen Iggy live, and McGregor really nailed Iggy's vibrating, spastic style of moves -- plus a few of his infamous moments, such as dancing 'til his pants fell down, feeling himself, etc.) And I think he did a very good job of conveying the frustration of someone who is what he is, is not the image that his partner/friend wants to see or wants him to be, and knows he can't live up to it.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is impossibly pretty and plays the part of Brian Slade very well; he pretty much *is* Bowie, as much as McGregor *is* Iggy. I've never seen him in anything before, but he did seem a bit wooden in parts; but then, from what I've read, Bowie was very ""detached"" from people at certain points during the Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane/Thin White Duke times in his career. Toni Collette was incredible as Mandy Slade, the fictionalized version of Angie Bowie. I would have liked to see more of her, but that wasn't really the scope of the film; I will definitely check out anything she appears in, in the future.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was incredible, hearkening back to all the incredible glitter rock songs with original songs, and remakes (20th Century Boy, TV Eye) that didn't make me shudder but got the spirit of it right.<br/><br/>Lastly, of course, this is a film of visual spectacle (as well as sound -- damn, I hope one of the art theaters by me plays it as a midnight flick!). I've seen Todd Haynes' previous films Poison and Safe, and these were visually arresting -- but Velvet Goldmine takes the cake for sheer beauty, artistry, and gorgeous strangeness. Everything Haynes does has a kind of compelling watchableness to it. I think Velvet Goldmine might possibly been in need of some tighter editing; but then again, maybe not, since it is much more a European film than an American film, in terms of the pacing and editing. It's not cut-cut-cut like so many US Hollywood films -- and I for one was glad. The stylization and formality of some of the visual composition -- and I'm not even talking about the glam scenes -- really sets the scenes apart and makes what the characters have to say that much more interesting.<br/><br/>All in all, this is well worth seeing, at least if you know and appreciate Bowie, Iggy, and the whole glitter rock era. It also made me eager to see the main leads -- McGregor, Rhys-Meyers, Collette and Bale -- in future work. And I'm anticipating Todd Haynes' next film with glee... as well as any possible future showings of Velvet Goldmine as a midnight feature in the art theaters around Chicago."

","The first time I saw this film was a while back (maybe a decade ago), and I thought it was interesting. I saw it a couple more times since then--each time a few years apart--and I liked it more and more with each viewing<br/><br/>In my opinion, it's one of the most underrated films. I really don't have any negatives to say about it. It's pacing flowed perfectly, which is really important since the story isn't linear and it travels around through the timeline. Sometimes this isn't done well in films and it becomes confusing to try to figure out when in the timeline a certain scene takes place. This wasn't like that at all; it was always clear when everything was, in spite of how often it jumped around to different events<br/><br/>It didn't shy away from the bisexual element, which I wholeheartedly applaud. Most films, especially ones with famous actors in them (as oppose to small, indie films), will avoid actually showing things like men kissing or any other man / man sexual content. To where even if a character is said to be gay or bisexual, the viewer will never actually see any clear evidence of this. But why shouldn't it be clear, considering how explicit man / woman relationships (kissing, sex, etc.) are shown in nearly every mainstream film?<br/><br/>Along those lines, the relationships in the film are well fleshed-out and complex, including the two main ones between the male characters. I'm glad about that, because it's nice to see bisexual relationships between men depicted as being real emotional connections rather than merely hookups. Especially since it seems that the stereotype about bisexual men (besides that we don't exist) is that our greatest love and romantic attachment is always with women (or with a specific woman), and that men are just people we screw on the side. This film did a great job dismantling this trope<br/><br/>I loved the main characters. They felt real and I could empathize with them easily. Some of them had flaws (some very serious flaws), but they all had enough redeeming qualities that I couldn't hate any of them. They felt like real people, and this was boosted by how great the acting all was. The story had a bittersweet but mostly pleasant and completely satisfying ending that tied up enough loose ends and in the end left me with a positive outlook on how the characters would end up<br/><br/>Also, there were some cool songs, especially if you're into glam rock.

","VELVET GOLDMINE does a superb job in capturing the essence of The Glam Rock Period. The music of Roxy Music, Slade, T-Rex, The Stooges, and many more showcase the anarchism of that fantastic scene. However, the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room is completely ignored! I think it would be hilarious and exceedingly interesting if David Bowie contributed a commentary track. Although you could make the case that Glam Rock would have occurred without Bowie, and this film certainly makes the case, his direction and artistic vision had an imprint on nearly every aspect of the genre. It would almost be like presenting the victory of The American North in the Civil War without mentioning Abraham Lincoln. VELVET GOLDMINE is a wonderful, fabulous vision of a sexually confusing and nihilistic social movement which enjoyed surprising mainstream success. This film does almost everything to explain the mystery and power of this fleeting musical fad and stylistic fashion by employing a curious metaphorical technique."

They aren't representative of the people themselves, so much as the vision of who they were at the time. <br/><br/>Velvet Goldmine was definitely (and beautifully!) bowdlerized, but that is because it was as much a story about the visions of nostalgia as it was about the events themselves. The movie is also riddled with elements of homo erotic empowering themes, and a vaguely satisfying blend of mysticism and artistic genius. It suggests a sort of chain of apprenticeship between artists and dreamers, represented by extremely fanciful and sometimes stunning imagery. <br/><br/>The movie tends to attract gay dreamers, pagans and goths more than any other demographic, but that's just fine.

Todd Haynes lovingly captures every aspect of the Glam Rock period with a baroque story of decadence and beauty.

","I thought this was a fabulous movie.  I wanted to watch it again immediately and I regret not seeing it when it was in the theaters.  Obviously, it's not for everyone and it only got mixed reviews by critics, which was why I didn't see it in the theater.  It works primarily on the level of fantasy. No, the narrative doesn't really work.  No, the David Bowie character isn't required to do much other than look pretty (which he does wonderfully - much prettier than David Bowie ever was, and Ewan McGregor is certainly 100 times prettier than Iggy Pop, as well as sexier).  No, the Oscar Wilde references don't add much and don't make a huge amount of sense.  And there definitely were several endings too many (although I didn't want it to end, so that was fine with me.)  And they never explained how/why the fake murder happened. And yes, it would've been a lot better if Haynes had gotten the rights to Bowie's songs. But ultimately, I didn't care about any of that. As someone who was a teenager in the 70's with my own fantasies about being a rock star, who adored David Bowie at the time, and was fascinated with his bisexuality and gender-bending in general, this movie was fascinating and absorbing.  While I personally prefer a more conventional narrative, the director's approach was refreshing.  I also just thought the movie was fun. I don't think the movie had anything in common with Sid & Nancy, which was basically just a story about a rock star's decline, and depressing to watch. This movie was about alot more than that: the meaning of public images and identities, fame, fantasy.

","If you aren't a huge David Bowie fan, you just won't get it. But if you are.... ahhhh.... it's like a little slice of heaven.<br/><br/>After a bit of a flouncy, supposedly mythic introduction, which informs us that pop superstardom was begotten by Oscar Wilde, Director Todd Haynes begins a cinematic montage set to Eno's ""Needles in the Camel's Eye"" which finds a gaggle of screaming glitter rock kids running down an English street with wild abandon. It's beautiful. To paraphrase the granddaddy of glam himself (Bowie), ""It's rugged and naive. It's heaven.""<br/><br/>Haynes proceeds to flip-flop around Bowie's story, embellishing where he wishes and changing things as he sees fit, to tell us a story of being true to yourself, in particular - your sexual self, and enjoying life to the utmost. Along the way, in addition to Johnathan Rhys-Meyers representing Bowie as Brian Slade, there are characters meant to represent Angela Bowie, Leslie Conn, Tony DeFries (Eddie Izzard), Iggy Pop (Ewan MacGregor), Marc Bolan, Cherry Vanilla, and more of Bowie's sphere. Then, Haynes brings himself to the story, in the character of a journalist named Arthur Stewart played by Christain Bale<br/><br/>What can be said? Again, if you ain't a fan of the whole scene, forget it. It will be meaningless tripe to you. Those of us in the know, love it. Haynes pops out all kinds of great stuff: Bowie in his folk rock phase, Bowie in his ""man dress,"" Bowie announcing his bisexuality to the press, Iggy dropping his pants while performing on stage, the conception of the term ""Mainman,"" the retreat to Berlin, Bowie's retirement announcement at the Hammersmith-Odeon, Iggy recording the ""Raw Power"" album, Bowie performing fellatio on Mick Ronson's strat, and on and on. It's like a documentary. But Haynes makes it one better introducing a romance between Bowie and Pop and by throwing homosexuality into the mix whenever possible.<br/><br/>The whole film is beautiful to watch. The 70's look like a candy colored rainbow (as the were). The glam rock boys with their fey posturing pour from the screen like sweet pink lemonade. It's spellbinding. His use of brilliant colors and his perfect use of period props make for wonderful moments. One of the finest moments in the film comes when the journalist, as a teen in the 70's, brings home his first Brian Slade record. Inspired by the gatefold of ""Aladdin Sane,"" this record has Rhys-Meyers posed dramatically wearing almost nothing. His lithe skin pours out of a velvet drape wrapped seductively around his frame. You can practically smell the vinyl and the glossy sleeve. The teenage Arthur has no choice, it seems, but to *** furiously to this image.<br/><br/>Visually, Haynes also pays playful homage to himself with a scene which is acted out with Barbie dolls representing Brian and Kurt. Haynes' first film (now out of print thanks to a ""Cease and Desist"" from brother Richard) was the story of Karen Carpenter played out by Barbie dolls. Haynes wisely juxtaposes all of this glamour with the drab colorlessness of the 80's as the story fluctuates between the two eras. This film is a visual feast. The 70's perfectly represented by the brightest of hues and the 80's seen as all gray, black and washed out red.<br/><br/>If there is any problem with the film it is in the use of ""new music"" on the score. Haynes uses several glam rock anthems throughout the film, drudging up everyone from Roxy Music to Gary Glitter, but not a note of Bowie's music can be heard on the film's soundtrack. The one once known as Ziggy refused, he claims, because Haynes wanted to use too many of his songs. So he allowed use of none. Bowie fans know this is bull-oney. Bowie has turned his back on the public sexual outrageousness of his youth, claiming it to be anything from a phase to a publicity stunt. Haynes' film uses this as it's sharpest dagger. The film is about a rock star who kills himself, his persona, out of fear, hurt, sexual rejection and shame. This is Bowie pure and simple. Why would the man allow his music to be used in a film which blatantly says he has sold out his own true identity. Who is the real Bowie? Is the real Bowie someone who would sell out his sexual past?<br/><br/>So Haynes must come up with new music to fill in the empty spaces. And, for the most part, it is pretty unlikely. Most of the songs use phrases and poetics quite unlike Bowie's usual ilk. Surely there is someone around who could come up with a few tunes in the style of Bowie's 70's mode? One of the worst of these songs has Rhys-Meyers having to mouth the term, ""the whole shebang"" several times. Uggh.<br/><br/>Still, Haynes is such a forthright and poetic filmmaker here this one problem barely deters us. Todd Haynes makes glam rock the apex of style and exalted existence.

This movie not only has spectacular costumes and visual effects, the emotion and torture of hiding true identity is portrayed brilliantly by Bale as the glam rock fanboy-turned journalist Arthur Stuart...not to mention the raw energy of Ewan McGregor's Curt Wild and the suppressed depression and style of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers's Brian Slade.

Kurt Wild is a hybrid of Iggy Pop, Lou Reed & Mick Jagger. Bryan Slade is Bowie than anyone else but there are also elements of Jobriath & Bryan Ferry. Jack Fairy is more Eno than Ferry (& so many 'forgotten' 70's drag queens).<br/><br/>Surely this film cannot be criticized for bending the historical facts when it is so clearly an evocation of the spirit of that time. The recreation of Brian Slade into the bland Stone character at the end of the movie is a statement about how conservative and moralistic the 80's were in comparison. Bowie's Let's Dance is the prime target. Eno also has 'gone straight' in recent years with his new status as ambient guru, RCA lecturer.<br/><br/>The innocence of that time meant that gay pop posturing still had the power to really shock. It's a sign of how far our culture has absorbed these influences that a film like this got funding and was made in the first place. I can't help but feel like we've lost something in the process."

Surely these characters are obviously modelled after mentioned glamrock-artists, including hairstyles, dress, etcetera, but they are not meant to represent the actual Bowie or Iggy Pop. In fact, as portrayed by Ewan McGregor Curt Wild looks more like Kurt Cobain.<br/><br/>If Todd Haynes had wanted to do a biopic about Bowie, he would have done so (just like he did with Karen Carpenter in his Barbie-doll epic). Instead Haynes has made a film about a period in time when rock'n'roll took an interesting turn, focussing on some artist's ambivalent sexual presentation and on stylish extravaganza. He links these themes with the adolescent audience's need for rolemodels, i.e. the young journalist in the film, whose Citizen Kane-like search for the truth about Brian Slade takes him back to the choices he has made during his own puberty. Finally, Haynes has crammed all these themes into a musical, giving him the opportunity to include a lot of music and dance, and to tell the Brian Slade-story in a videoclip-like artificial style. In my opinion all of this adds up to a great film.<br/><br/>I suppose Mr.  Jones' refusal to let Haynes use Mr. Bowie's music is a typical example of the questionable attitude that is shown by Mr. Slade/Mr. Stone in Velvet Goldmine."

From his first film, ""Superstar"", where he filmed the Karen Carpenter story using manipulated Barbie Dolls, his subject matter has been a bold mixture of horror, documentary, comedy and disease of the week TV films (see ""Safe"").  Though not his best film, Velvet Goldmine is his most accessible and a heck of a lot of fun.  Sure, this is a gay fantasy of the life of David Bowie, but what do you expect from a gay filmmaker.  Haynes is one of only two ""indie"" directors (the other, Michael Tolkin) making enduring relevant films that do not involve guns or slackers. Haynes avoids the pastiche cliche seen in many recent 70s revival movies (see Boogie Nights) in ""Goldmine"".  Instead he creates a loving, mystical recreation of life in the era of vinyl.  These people are not slackers, but consumers, and consumption is his main theme.  This film is provocative long after you have left the theater. The most amazing contribution to this film is the original soundtrack, based mostly on David Bowie themes.  Unlike Bowie, whose obscurity if often misunderstood, these songs provide a groundwork from which they stem, often surpassing songs they are parodying."

The film is set in an alternate-universe version of planet Earth that's part fantasy, part nightmare.  Greil Marcus' Lipstick Traces, Jack Smith's aleatory essays on Maria Montez, epigrams by Oscar Wilde incorporated repeatedly into the script, and a surprisingly thoughtful rumination upon fannish appreciation for mass culture and the stance of the fan, all add up to elements that make this movie a lot bigger than the sum of its parts.  But what I took away from it was the dream-like clarity of Haynes' magical vistas, and the exquisite beauty with which his camera endows the principal players:  Ewan MacGregor, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Toni Collette (resembling Sandy Dennis risen from the grave in her Eighties sequences), and the enigmatic Jack Faery (who played him, anyway?).

I was never convinced that the Brian Slade portrayed had the charisma or magnetism to inspire such adoration, so I never really cared about what was happening.

","Todd Haynes' Velvet Goldmine is an ambitious film about the lives and loves of the front-runners of the glam-rock explosion that dominated much of the early 70s. Starting with a reference to the writer and poet, Oscar Wilde, this film deals with all things interesting, intriguing, intelligent and beautiful. Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as glam-rock giant, Brian Slade, aka Maxwell Demon, who in 1974, at the height of his fame and popularity, was assasinated on stage. A few weeks later, however, the whole incident was found to be a hoax. Brain Slade was never to be seen again. Or so everyone thought. Among the audience on the night of his apparent death, was young fan, Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale - Metroland and more recently, the controversial adaptation of American Psycho). Cut to 10 years later, and Stuart is living in New York as a journalist. On the 10th anniversary of Slade's ""death"", Stuart is asked to write an article on him, where is he now? what's he doing? For Stuart, researching this story means finding out exactly what he was like with his wife, Mandy (superbly portrayed by Muriel's Wedding's star, Toni Collette) and his turbulent affair with fellow rock superstar, Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor). It also means that Stuart has to delve into his own past which more than heavily featured the lives of Slade and Wild. Ultimately, though, his research leads to shock revelations about what really happened to Brian Slade. Featuring top quality performances from all involved, Velvet Goldmine does not fail to entertain. Any glam-rock fan will be more than satisfied with the musical aspect of the film which sees Ewan McGregor strutting his stuff as Iggy Pop, with his fabulous rendition of ""TV Eye"". There could however be an aspect of die-hard fans feeling somewhat betrayed by what this film is implying. There is after all, no secret about who the characters Brian Slade and Curt Wild are allegedly not based on but what the hell? The film is exciting, fun, captivating and above all, just gorgeous."

","My best friend once told me not to watch this movie, as it would offend my evangelical Christian sensibilities. Well, the nudity and sexuality (and there is A LOT) is not really what bothered me about this movie. What bothered me was the lack of a satisfying conclusion. After two hours, the audience is left with an ending that sort of leaves you with a, ""Huh?"" There just didn't seem to be a point.<br/><br/>You'll notice that I still gave the film 7 stars, which means I thought it was pretty good. The hair, make up, and costume design alone are worthy of praise in this film, and I'm pretty sure it ate up half the budget. And Todd Haynes apparently decided to make up for this by casting actors that no one (in his home country anyway) had heard of, the one possible exception being Christian Bale (who looks like he'd just stepped off the set of 'Newsies' for half the film), but even at that, Bale had not yet shocked every critic in the world with his portrayal of Patrick Bateman, much less played Batman, and therefore not a name the film could rest on. Ewan McGregor wasn't Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Jonathan Rhys Myers hadn't yet played the King of Rock 'n' Roll, or the king of England. It was risky, but the whole lot were amazingly talented and more than up to the job, as their performances in the film and their careers since are more than evidence of.<br/><br/>The film, rather than being an unconventional biopic like Haynes' 'I'm Not There', is more like an abbreviated, fictionalized history of the Glam Rock movement. Rhys-Myers and McGregor's characters represent two sides of the movement; Rhys-Myers' Brian Slade is all about flamboyance and glitter eye make up; McGregor's Curt Wild is more about pure shock value, and Bale's young Arthur Stuart is simply a fan. <br/><br/>The unconventional structure is the result of the storytelling as it is sort of built around Bale's character, an older Arthur Stuart who hasn't changed much in looks save for a haircut, as a reporter in 1984 investigating the life of Brian Slade. You get Stuart's own rememberings of the era mixed in with the testimony of those he interviews. All of this seems to be building to something, but at the end of the film, it just falls flat and leaves you asking yourself, ""What?""<br/><br/>So Mr. Haynes, 7/10 for great set and costume design, and fantastic acting, but you lose the other three for the complete lack of an appropriate ending."
"reel_emotion","10","3","6","28 July 2007"," 2VG: Fade Away Never
","Todd Haynes' film, Velvet Goldmine, is a masterful tribute/love letter to the glam/glitter rock movement of the 1970s. All the audience really knows of Velvet Goldmine's idols is what any fan would know. We experience the story through interviews and musical performances and that astoundingly provides us with enough information. It's the aesthetic of ""man's life is his image""that superficial beauty expressed through art reveals so much more than at first glance. Haynes (Far From Heaven, I'm Not There) has a passion for music and its artists that shows: his earlier short film, Superstar, about Karen Carpenter, acted by an-all Barbie and Ken cast, is referenced in Velvet Goldmine in one of my favorite scenes in which two young girls play with Brian Slade and Curt Wild Kens while T-Rex's ""Diamond Meadows"" spins on their record player. In Velvet Goldmine, a top-notch, well-chosen cast acts out the principle characters and stories here wonderfully.<br/><br/>Glam rock superstar, Brian Slade (based on David Bowie), is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""The Tudors,"" Elvis, Match Point) to perfection with his thin, effeminate looks and swaggering. Haynes has great fun with the notion that there was a time in popular culture history that androgyny and bisexuality were seen as a cool fad. Velvet Goldmine's main story is Brian Slade's rise and fall from fame. Slade's cold and calculating ways accumulate in the hoax of his own assassinationthe ultimate symbol for the death of glam rock. His most sympathetic side is revealed during his affair and subsequent break-up with punk rocker Curt Wild.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting, Star Wars Prequels, The Island) plays Curt Wild by feverishly emulating Iggy Pop--although the history of Wild having electroshock therapy to cure his homosexual leanings is straight from the life of rock icon Lou Reed. McGregor's performance of ""T.V. Eye"" and ""Gimme Danger"" are startling and unforgettable. Both Rhys Meyers and McGregor do their own singing for their characters. Upon seeing Wild's performance, Slade is obviously envious of him and attracted to himinspired, Slade takes his music to the next level. On his first trip to America, Slade doesn't forget about Wild and meets him. Slade and his entourage go to a club where Polly Smalls (Donna Matthews and Teenage Fanclub) performs in a very Suzi Quatro way. Wild sits in the corner, obviously strung out on heroinall the while Mandy Slade, Brian's wife, laughs. But Slade gets Wild a music contractand Slade becomes Wild's new ""main man."" Later Mandy describes Slade's and Wild's relationship as being marketed as some sort of new Tracy and Hepburn. Mandy and Brian become more estranged.<br/><br/>Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, In Her Shoes, Little Miss Sunshine) is perfectly cast as the love-her-or-hate-her Mandy. Pay close attention to her accent: She is not doing it badly--here is an Aussie doing an accent of an American woman who would often speak in a faux English accent. Brilliant. Mandy goes from being an audacious woman to a cynical woman. Ten years later her broken marriage is the only interest anybody has in her as rock journalist Arthur Stuart interviews her in a bar.<br/><br/>Another one of the three gorgeous male leads, Christian Bale (American Psycho, Batman Begins, Rescue Dawn), plays glam rock fan/rock journalist Arthur Stuart. Although his part seems to exist as a frame tale, he's the most effective and relatable character in Velvet Goldmine. The subplot of Arthur is one of the most unique coming out stories about being a closeted homosexual along with being a closeted glam fan. In his bedroom, teen Arthur listens to his Maxwell Demon album while staring at the seductive gatefold picture of a semi-nude Slade. Does he want him? Or does he want to be him? Bale's acting here is a revelationhe reveals so much through those eyes and facial expressions. He also has a major transition: he goes from a wide-eyed, vulnerable, and fan-obsessed teenager to a downcast-eyed, jaded, and wiser adult. Much to his chagrin, the adult Arthur is given the assignment of finding out whatever happened to Brian Slade. He clearly wants to forget his past, but is it from embarrassment of youthful fanaticism, or is it something more? Leaving home because of his sexual orientation and love of glam rock, young Arthur does not have to live vicariously through his idols anymore and can start living his life as he must. After the Death of Glitter Rock concert, young Arthur meets Wildthat leads to a one night stand on the roof top and Arthur's literally taking the place of his superstar idol, Brian Slade, in Wild's heart if just for one night. Adult Arthur overcomes some of his jadedness as he confronts and makes peace with his past. During Tommy Stone's press conference, he asks him about his connection to ""bisexual pop singer"" Brian Slade""Tommy Stone"" being Slade's '80s more commercial reincarnation of himself. Earlier in school, young Arthur scribbles out a sketch of Brian Slade while his teacher reads from Oscar Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray, which sums up Arthur's experience: ""He felt that he had known them all.It seemed that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own."" <br/><br/>In Velvet Goldmine there is the theme of the permanence of art. Todd Haynes shows that this musicand this movie--is much more than disposable pop culture, but akin to the works of Oscar Wilde and the movie Citizen Kane, both which he references throughout, and that art is kept alive by the appreciation of it by the fans. Oscar Wilde's emerald pin symbolizes thisas it passes to one artist to another, then to a fan, Arthur. In return Arthur Stuart gives his Tommy Stone press pass to a young eager fan. An old favorite, ""2HB,"" plays on the jukebox, and we see everyone enjoying the music. One person says, ""God, I love this song."" Velvet Goldmine ends with the final message of the song: ""fade away never."""

We're introduced to some bizarre yet compelling characters, such as Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), sort of a Kurt Cobain predecessor (okay, comparisons are inevitable and often wrongful), and Mandy (Toni Collette), Slade's scatter-brained wife, as the movie flashes back to tell Arthur's youth during that shiny period (David Bowie, Iggy Pop - anyone?) known as Glam Rock Era, then fasts forward ten years after ALL THAT PARTY.<br/><br/>""Velvet Goldmine"" is a very original piece of movie-making, with an outstanding soundtrack that includes almost all the greatest songs from that decade. It is no hype at all to say this is the ""Citizen Kane"" of Glam Rock Era. The cast is smashing: McGregor in one of his most barefaced performances (one year later, he went to the ""Dark Side"" with ""Star Wars: Episode I"", but Ewan never abandoned indie cinema and has become one of the best actors of the past years); Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (a rising star especially after ""Match Point"" and ""Elvis"", the latter which earned him a Golden Globe this year), and Collette, one year before taking the part of Haley Joel Osment's mother in ""The 6th Sense"" (and getting a coveted Oscar nomination for best supporting actress). But this is Christian Bale's film after all. Although he has less screen time than I wished, he's the heart and soul of ""Velvet Goldmine"", as a sensitive man who was brought to life during those exciting years. This actor has proved he can do anything - an American psycho, an insomniac machinist or even Batman; Bale is one of the most underrated actors of our time, and ""Velvet Goldmine"" is one of his finest moments.<br/><br/>A film to be seen - and listened to - at the highest volume level (for those who, like me, weren't born by that time, this is a great way of experiencing it). My vote is 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>P.S.: Todd Haynes is currently making ""I'm Not There"" about Bob Dylan, with Heath Ledger, Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett, Michelle Williams, Richard Gere, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Bale, again.

It's chiefly about legendary mercurial David Bowie-like glam-rock god Brain Slade (the strikingly charismatic Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who at the peak of his popularity notoriously faked his own audacious on-stage assassination death and subsequently vanished altogether from public view. Ten years later former glam-rock fan turned successful British investigative journalist Arthur Stuart (excellently played by Christian Bale) is assigned by his editors to write a story on Slade, so Stuart tracks down Slade's old pals and associates to find out the exact reasons for his sudden disappearance.<br/><br/>Todd Haynes' spirited direction and smart, witty, precisely etched script relate the compelling story in tricky flashback fashion, tracing Slade's humble beginnings and upward ascent to glam-rock superstardom with provocative insights into how glam-rock rode the crest of the swingin' 70's sexual revolution, glam-rock's deliberate attempt at erasing gender lines that separate men and women, the wanton bisexuality, gleeful decadence, bold androgyny, and flamboyant excesses that were fundamental components of glam-rock, and how being famous blurs the distinction between private life and public life. Gorgeously shot in loud, splashy, yet still elegant bright colors by Maryse Alberti, with a moody score by Carter Burwell and a marvelously ornate and melodic glam-rock soundtrack, the film lavishly evokes glam-rock's gloriously gaudy and theatrical over-the-top style in deliciously thorough and baroque detail. Although Rhys Meyers' spellbinding portrayal of Slade clearly dominates the picture, there are equally impressive turns by Toni Collette as Slade's bawdy, sassy American wife, Ewan McGregor as crazed, grungy Iggy Poppish garage hard rock maniac Curt Wild, and Eddie Izzard as an aggressively brazen record company executive.

","This is definitely a discredited movie in my eyes. It is shocking to me that one of the man criticisms of this film was its disregard for accuracy. However I feel its accuracy is beyond any one who isn't a complete bowie iggy, or Oscar wilde fan. The point of the movie was not to portray David Bowie's exact life line, it was to portray the wild ride of 3 people going through this transient mist barely resembling life. At the same time going back to themes found in The Picture of Dorian Gray, using it as a moral guide line for the character whose musical career is loosely based off of David Bowie, simply because he experienced these times a its peak, and left a trace of some surreal icon. If the movie were written as a biography of David Bowie, or Iggy Pop, or Brian Eno, it would not of been fitting to any of the three stars. The only way you can present these characters is in a fictional event such as Velvet Goldmine, hinting at its origins with little facts. Like the guitar licking scene, the scene when Brian Slade meets Curt Wilde he is presented in the same way David Bowie's wife met lou reed. Brian's first words to Mandy's are the same as Angie's first words to Bowie. Bowie's costume designer did marry his manager, etc. etc.. Subtle points are given simply to enrich a plot line not just revolving around the seventies or Dorian Gray, but revolving around this loss of innocence, this rebellion, the drugs, everything. This same theme that is shown in citizen cane. The structural ground for the work is even the same, advocating the journalist as a tool to tell the tale, working through people of the past. This theme in Velvet Goldmine is shown with beauty and grace, not in words but through half fictional characters of the past, because of their beauty. Not many cult films can be read in to that much. Which is why I idolize Velvet Goldmine not as a biography, or a retelling or anything, but as a film."

They are trying to take us behind the red Curtain when the show can't go on. David Bowie was the first who tried to take people in this glamorous, dangerous, risky, dark world of Rock and Roll. And I think he fulfilled his ambition. Velvet Goldmine is a movie that talks about people who are lost. They are trying to find the truth in drugs, lies, music and delusion. No, no they don't find the true meaning of life after all, but in some peculiar way they change themselves into a creature is not so real but it is so beautiful, deferent and attractive. It's a try. We are all trying to change ourselves and the world but we can't. These guys did. Velvet Goldmine is a world that we all wanted to see but we couldn't see it, at all. Brian Slade is a thin, clever, ambitious boy. Fame made him take things over and made him loose. That's why he is trying to find someone like Curt Wild. He wants to love and be loved in return. He wants to raise his hand and touch the lies and sell this captious world, forget about what people say and follow his heart. I don't care if this movie is a gay film. I care about the purpose that this movie was filmed and the central idea people will take in the end. ""Do anything makes you happy and forget about the others"". It's great when you can live in a fairytale just for a while, no matter how it will cost to you. David Bowie was a Legend. Ziggy was a myth. We always remember you! We never forget! Because when you write history your soul and your mind must be open. Bowie changed our point of view as well as he did with himself. It's good when you want to become another man because if you are the same person all your life, your past and future will be so dull and boring as the bedtime stories that your mother used to say to you in order to make you fall asleep under the serious, crazy moonlight."

But if you were a teenybopper in the glitter era of the Seventies  which it is portraying: Bowie, Mick Ronson, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Warhol et al  you'd be hard pressed to find a better account of what it was really like for the era's teenagers. Right down to teenager Arthur noticing that everyone else was running to the concert venue for no particular reason and joining in  just in case they knew something he didn't. It happened all the time!And of course the complete incomprehension of parents when faced with effeminate glittered- up pop idols. Bowie's on-stage antics with Ronson and his ""retiring"" from live performances (""it's a god awful small affair"") Even the bit about the ""gay"" interviews . It makes me smile every time I watch it  and the rendition of the Roxy Music song Song for Europe is utterly superb."

Along his journey, he remembers his own dabblings in the Glam Rock lifestyle, and his encounters with the famous rockers Slade and Curt Wild (a flamboyant, 100% pure fun performance by Ewan McGregor!!!). In interviews with Slade's first manager (Michael Feast) and wife Mandy Slade (a great turn by Toni Collette), Arthur begins to piece together the mystery of Brian Slade, pop idol de-throned.<br/><br/>At the very end came a twist that I to this day cannot figure out.

However, to me he really got as close to Iggy Pop as one can get! Same goes for Rhyes-Meyers and Bowie. Another big plus for this movie is the Soundtrack, that mixes classic stuff like Lou Reed's ""Satellite Of Love"" with new glam-like songs, such as ""The Ballad of Maxwell Demon"" by Shudder To Think. What the true intention of this movie is, however, I don't know. The Oscar Wilde comparisons and quotes are nice, but what is the story meant to tell us? As a big fan of films and legends about rockstars the question I asked myself the most was who exactly were the main characters supposed to be? One recognizes David Bowie (Brian Slade), his guitarist Mick Ronson (in the guitar-solo-blowjob-scene during ""Baby's on Fire"") and Iggy Pop (Curt Wilde). McGregors character mixes even more personlities, some of which confuse me in this context. There's a little Lou Reed, a little Oscar Wilde (the surname) and also Kurt Cobain (the first name and the looks). What the heck has Cobain got to do with glam??? Can anyone tell me what the meaning of the green jewel was? And what kind of relationship did Curt and Arthur have? A lot of questions that maybe aren't even worth being answered."

","I'm quite amazed at the praise some have given this film. I think 'The best movie I've ever seen' is an inexplicable statement having seen _some_ of it... Yes I'm afraid I stopped watching it after an hour or so. Even ignoring all of the glaring inaccuracies of UK in the 70s, VG was without a doubt the most incohesive, hap-hazard stream of bad pop videos and badly acted nonsense I've ever seen. The metaphors, if indeed they were metaphors, were tenuous at best and offered nothing to the movie or the viewer. The makeup and costumes swerved from Gary Glitter-Glam 70s to Adam Ant-New Romantic 80s and back again. I know by reading previous postings that the costume designers have been offered awards but how many on the voting panel were actually in London in the 70s? And where were the normal people? The bowlcut flare wearing Evel Knievel fans of the Bay City Rollers? Which leads me onto the music... Not everyone sang and acted like Bowie! What about Slade, Wizzard, Deep Purple et al?... Well sure I didn't see it all and perhaps therefore my comments can be ignored. Perhaps the second half was a revelation in film making, and I missed a treat. But the fact of the matter is, I believe that it's nothing to do with my lack of vision, my level of intelligence or my inability to perceive that makes me dislike this movie, it's the fact that it's plotless, noisy, unpleasant nonsense. Avoid, unless you like watching an inaccurate documentary on people you've never heard of on VH1 for two hours."
"Bucky-3","1","6","18","27 September 1998"," Controversial...original...absolute trash
","Writer-director Todd Haynes has created a controversial and original piece; one that doesn't rely on so much on its main characters but rather whom they might represent.  David Bowie, for example, bears a striking resemblance to Velvet Goldmine's fictional protagonist, Brian Slade (Ewan McGregor).<br/><br/>But any chance of examining Slade's character is conveniently avoided, as Haynes seems much more concerned with show-casing homosexual orgies rather than studying what makes Slade kick.<br/><br/>Even more ridiculous is that the film attempts to link Slade to the great Oscar Wilde - with dismal results.  This is a very confused and distraught film that never once breaks into a good moment that lasts more than just a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>The basic premise of Velvet Goldmine is intriguing, but Hayne's turns his material into absolute trash in a matter of minutes.  Who would have thought that such a promising film would turn out to be one of the year's worst?"
"The_Movie_Cat","2","4","11","4 October 2000"," ""Personally I think it's meaningless""
","Imagine the most pretentious sixth form art student in existence. Multiply it by a thousand. Now picture the indulgent scribblings in the back of his copybook, hurled upon celluloid and coated with vomit. And, as Ewan McGregor said in Trainspotting, ""you're still nowhere near"".<br/><br/>McGregor himself gets top billing in Velvet Goldmine, though only plays a supporting role. He portrays Curt Wild, witless parody of Iggy Pop. We're told Wild is from the US, which is helpful as judging from McGregor's accent it could be anywhere. A fine actor, he unfortunately takes the same tack as in The Phantom Menace - i.e. every time he says a line, a smirk passes his lips. He's not taking it seriously, and most of the others involved aren't either.<br/><br/>Velvet Goldmine has a terrible reputation and I was all ready to give it a fair chance. I can usually find some merit in derided films, even Batman & Robin possessed thirty seconds that wasn't completely unwatchable. Other 90s superturkeys such as North, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and The Avengers contained the odd moment that stirred you from a comatose position. But Velvet Goldmine engenders not a second of interest throughout its overlong two hours duration. Even the shock tactic of nudity bores with it's indulgent direction, and I have to concur that it's reputation is fully deserved.<br/><br/>A juvenile, exaggerated Bowie pastiche, it begins with an indecipherable prologue that links the story of glitter-spreading UFOs with the birthline of Oscar Wilde (No, I'm not making it up). This is stapled together by a Janet McTeer narration, poor thing, who must deliver some of the most ham-fisted; navel-gazing dirge ever put to paper.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is a reporter who has an exclusive revelation up his sleeve - one which he shouts out in full range of other reporters, which kind of defeats the purpose somewhat. Anyway, his job is to uncover the secret life of Brian Slade, played reasonably by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. While Meyers (or his occasional vocal double, Thom Yorke of Radiohead) has an okay voice, the original material (sample lyric: ""like a peppermint eaten away, will I fight, will I swagger, will I sway?"" - and that's one of the better ones) is made to look even weaker by having original period tunes in the soundtrack.<br/><br/>This is a film which begins ""Although what you are about to see is a work of fiction, it should nevertheless be played at full volume"", which is about as far up your own back passage as you can get. The title is meaningless within the film, and only exists as it turns out to be a Bowie album track. Oh, that's okay then. Just another indulgence to add to the mix. Writer/director Todd Haynes described this film as being like the effects of drugs. If that means meandering, banal and irritating, then he's succeeded. One of the very few times I've been forced to use my ""2"" vote, I was staggered to find that, at date of writing, this has over an average 6/10 on the IMDb. There's a moment in the middle of the film where Christian Bale is caught by his parents engaging in a solo sexual activity. By a staggering coincidence, that activity also sums up this film..."

The storyline was barely convincing especially with Bale remembering his association with 'Glam' in his teenage years. The film really wasted the talents of McGregor and Bale. I couldn't even follow this film, it was confusing and self absorbed. What was the point of it all?<br/><br/>If you're a huge fan of the Glam period, see it!

The musical scenes were well done, but that's the last good thing I can say about the film. Unless you're really into glam rock or have an unusual ability to concentrate on the banal, I warn you that you may not be able to figure out what the incessant flashbacks and portrayal of debauchery is adding to the plot.

Following the rise and fall of Brian Slade, glam rock superstar, and all the people he affected, the movies portrays the power that society gives to a pop icon. ""Rock 'n Roll is a prostitute, it should be tarted up."" Not just about the rock genre at all. Any pop icon out there goes for extremes, and then society breeds followers and fans. Velvet Goldmine follows a fan/a follower, a movement and a pop icon as well as his influences through the rise and fall. This movie is a superb character study for an archetype for any pop icon, not merely a glam rocker. Fame brings power to influence the masses, and as you see in Velvet Goldmine, it also can bring self destruction in the spotlight. Plus, the soundtrack is excellent!"

","For all of you interested fans in glam and Velver Goldmine, I thought I'd give you a link to check out.<br/><br/>http://www.glam-ou-rama.co.uk/reviews_show.asp?id=77 Brian Slade, although resembling Bowie throughout the film, is actually based on the true story of Jobriath, an extremely obscure glam rock star who fell from stardom after a failed publicity stunt in which he faked his own death on stage. While Bowie was ambiguous about his sexuality, Jobriath flat out said ""I'm a true fairy (which is quoted in VG, with the introduction of Jack Ferry's character...another possible reference?)"". Thus, Bowie's career took off while America shunned Jobriath. I mean, cmon...saying ""I'm a true fairy"" in 1972...in America...warns't the smartest career move. Bruce Cambell was his real name (not to be confused with the ""Evil Dead"" star), and was diagnosed with schizophrenia early in his career, so he himself thought quite literally that he actually DID kill his alter ego, Jobriath, on stage. Jobriath is considered to be one of the biggest failures of rock n roll's hype machine, fueled this time by flashy exec and producer Jerry Brandt, who wanted to promote Jobriath as the next Elvis. Brandt is obviously given credit in Velvet Goldmine with Eddie Izzard's fantastic performance. Fascinating but tragic story about the backlash of an over-hyped washout rocker. He changed his name to Cole Porter after his rock career flopped, and was one of the 1st reported cases of dying of AIDS."

","Though a major box office hit,this film is not commercial-it rather reminds of Italian Neorealism,Ken Russell,Orson Welles... In Citizen Kane style a journalist is determined to find out more about the life of the(supposedly)dead pop star Brian Slade,several years after the actual events happened.This inquiry becomes(just like in Welles's creation)a puzzle,a labyrinth of facts,legends,myths,rumors,each bit and piece of evidence telling its own partial truth. Brian Slade's story was seen by most of the viewers alike as a thinly disguised biography of David Bowie-he looks like Bowie,has Bowie's preferences and lifestyle,is even born in on the same day and in the same year like Bowie,on the 8th of January 1947-this film doesn't have to be an allusion only to David Bowie,on the same day,however twelve years earlier another famous music icon was born,with whom Slade's career also resembles:Elvis(trough a strange coincidence the same actor which played Brian Slade in this film also recently acted in a biographic film about Elvis). Besides Bowie and Elvis,Brian Slade also reminds of other influential stars of the twentieth century music industry like Jim Morrison,Mick Jagger,Ozzie Osbourne,Bryan Ferry,Kurt Cobain,Marc Bolan and others. Another comparison which plays a very important part in this film is the similarity between Oscar Wilde and Slade,from the beginning of the film Slade being shown as a modern day Oscar Wilde(or even Scott Fitzgerald,who like Wilde was an Irishman, a dandy,a big spender,a witty aesthete both in work and life,a controversial,often theatrical and scandalous character,who even died at the same age as Wilde,at 44,also bankrupt and forgotten by the time of his death only to also be rediscovered after wards)and also the whole film being spiced up with famous quotes from Wilde's work. In my opinion,Slade is,besides a great performer,a real genius. Already in his childhood he was misunderstood and bullied in school(like it often happens with talented people)and in his early teens he increasingly broke off his respectable,bourgeois,middle-class roots,dressing up in a somewhat exaggerated,opulent way(almost tasteless,but this is probably what being a dandy is about,playing a risky game at the verge of tasteless vulgarity,at the boundary between ridicule and sublime),engaging in bisexual experiences,and,above all trying his luck in music with increasing success. Still very young he reaches the height of his fame and has almost overnight everything a man can dream about-fortune,fame,an unrestricted sex-life,also a wife who loves him-their first date resembling to the fateful encounter between Jim and Pam immortalized in the film ""The Doors""(she's called Mandy in the film hinting both at Barry Manilow's famous tune and also another woman immortalized by another famous song:Angie,the same Angie that inspired the famous Rolling Stones hit,this very Angie happened to be Bowie's ex-wife). While Curt Wild(more than Iggy Pop/Oscar Wilde),Slade's homo-erotic flame is a more energetic,temperamental performer than the cool,sophisticated Slade-his violent,unique on-stage performances of Jim Morrison's or Ozzie Osbourne's much talked about (by that time scandalous,because today not even such gestures shocking anymore)whiskeys,drugs,masturbation,exhibitionism or biting pigeon's and bat's heads off-shows.Curt Wilde is a true rocker and the match between him and Slade is more that sexual-they also communicate on an intellectual level ,their relationship being a somewhat idealized form of homo-eroticism seen also in the strange male friendship from Women in Love,in Fellini's Satirycon,or in the films of Visconti or Pasolini(both of them homosexual). But eventually Slade will,like many other superstars,pay the price for his success-one day he is allegedly murdered,without anyone realizing what actually happened-many fans of his thinking he would still be alive(another parallel to Elvis,of whom many people even today claim to have actually discovered that he is still alive),some even supposing it was all just a marketing strategy due to the fact that record-sales began to decrease,after all he himself predicted in a far too obvious way that he knows he's going to get killed. This last supposition,as preposterous as it sounds,turned out to be true-after all today's stars also know how to capitalize on faked suicide/suicide attempts,nervous breakdowns,sex scandals and every sensational lie possible,they,their agents and managers,the businessmen,the tabloids,the TV channels come up with,as long as it sells&pays. However,like in a literary work by Wilde or Fitzgerald,something did happen to Brian Slade,after his publicity stunt he reappears years later visibly changed-even the actor playing Slade is another one-in spite of his opulent shows in Liberace or Siegfried&Roy style(and notice that his natural style was always a top of the line,glamorous one)he clearly lacks the originality and wit from his earlier period,having become hopelessly mainstream,his decay being apparently not as radical as we are used from Wilde or Fitzgerald,Brian Slade does not die,he doesn't lose his mind,not even his status and fortune,he doesn't end up as an alcoholic or drug addict,his decay is far deeper and somewhat far radical one,the lost beauty,ideal,fascination once achieved are impossible to bring back(like Wilde's Dorian Gray or Fitzgerald's Gatsby he is trying without succeeding to turn himself into a half-god,to reach impossibly inaccessible ideals,or,maybe Kane's ""Rosebud""). I can't quite understand why Slade(who seems to be like Jim Morrison more a poet rather than a superstar from a strictly commercial viewpoint underwent the change for other reasons than merely lucrative ones,or maybe he didn't act on purpose,it was just the way the ruthless world of showbiz seriously altered him,before he could have even the slightest idea what happened to him.Anyway,many questions remain open,a clear conclusion of the plot,a clear solution/answer to the quizzical labyrinth called Brian Slade actually missing,yet such an outcome fits the main character totally-gifted artist are often unpredictable,contradictory,controversial,hard to live with,difficult to understand,moody,unbalanced. This film is a masterpiece for various reasons,like the awesome soundtrack(including,among other songs,some Roxy Music hits-in fact something of Bryan Ferry's distinctive style influenced this film)which,like in Oliver Stone's The Doors or Abba.The Movie(two other films about two other music legends I would gladly recommend to anyone liked this film)is an important part of the plot,perfectly matching the character's actions,feelings,the mood,the period... Psychologically accurate,ruthless yet subtle critic the of consumerist star-system,both highly realistic(unprejudiced,frank) and highly poetic. I wish more art films like that were made nowadays."

However, the film tries to do too much. While the images are striking, the film fails to offer any in-depth emotional involvement, partly due to the division of screen time between too many (almost interchangeable) male characters, none of whom are very sympathetic or likeable. Another problem is the wretched singing of Ewan McGregor's character (I'm not sure if it was really Ewan or not, but either way it's baaaaaad) and the lack of charisma of the Bowie dude--a fatal problem for a character who's meant to represent the ultimate in pop stardom. Also there are ridiculous UFO allusions. The Wilde references were appropriate and welcome. Basically a sensationalistic gay melodrama, which may be your cuppa tea or not."

It's about a young vocalist Brian Slade trying for the heights of pop stardom. Apparently, any move you care to make is permissible when you're striving for top-rating. He emulates the current popstars and encourages friendships and business liaisons with those who matter.  Ewan McGregor fans will not be disappointed in his ""bare all"" stage performance as the drug ridden Curt Wild and his fall from grace. But it is Brian Slade's story and as played by Johnathon Rhys-Meyer we get a sincere and energetic performance.  Some of the flashbacks do get a bit confusing as we jump from decade to decade, but does it really matter?

","I first learned of Todd Haynes with the release of his 2002 drama ""Far from Heaven"", starring Julianne Moore as a 1950s housewife who develops a relationship with her African-American gardener after discovering her husband kissing a man. It turned out that Haynes had been making movies for some years by that point, including 1998's ""Velvet Goldmine"". This Academy Award-nominated spectacle is a look at the glam rock era, with Christian Bale as a reporter trying to find out what became of a glam star from the early '70s. This movie has it all: drug use, orgies, sexual fluidity, and everything else that was characteristic of the era.<br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece, but damned if the cast members don't put their all into the roles.

In fact, Bowie was approached, but he then had plans of making his own movie about this time, and demurred. He also did not allow the use of his music for this film.<br/><br/>So a somewhat fictionalized account was used. It is told in flashback, when newspaper writer played by Christian Bale has to write an article about a sensational death of a rock star, which turned out to have been staged and fraudulent. The rock star is a Ziggy-like androgynous glam-rock star, played by Jonathan Rhys Myers. Bale's writer has ambivalent feelings about the assignment, behaving a bit like a clumsy teenager at the time, attracted to this glam rock movement and struggling with his sexuality. Ewan McGregor plays another rock star who is a pastiche of Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Mick Jagger. Toni Collette plays an Angela Bowie type character, who helps fill in the gaps of the story of her husband.<br/><br/>The British glam-rock scene seems to have been well-captured, with all the purported decadence of the stars. Classic songs of the period by the likes of T.Rex, Slade, Roxy Music, Brian Eno, and Cockney Rebel make up for the lack of Bowie songs. Highly recommended."

For example Kurt is described in 1971 as the leader of a garage band.  I don't think the word ""garage"" was used in reference to music until the 1980's.  Also Kurt wears dark blue nail varnish, which I don't recall being available at that time.  There is also an anachronistically old-fashioned computer shown in the later time scenes (but this is common in films)."

","I was very excited to see this film, as I am a fan of the glam rock era, but I found myself disappointed, disjointed and finally, underwhelmed at this frivolous look at a mesmerizing time in rock history. It is sad to note that this era had real melodrama to spare and this film only showed us superficial extended MTV videos, peppered with a few VH 1 ""Behind the Scenes"" style testimonials.  It doesn't help that, where it might have benefited from paying homage to a ""Citizen Kane"" style of storytelling (an overused comparison I feel is unfair to the classic film) instead it does a rip-off of the film ""Eddie and the Cruisers,"" a film which is a schlocky one without as much effort to appear inspired by anything.  Why people think Todd Haynes has any vision more than employing a magnificent cinematographer is beyond me.  It is obvious to me that he simply cashes in on what others appear to be interested in with little or no research into the matter and runs with it.  Here, as in his film ""Safe"" where he explores the fascination with new age fears of environmental ""diseases,""  he doesn't delve deeply, gets loads of information wrong and ultimately answers no questions.  This would not be a problem if he made the story the least bit believable or interesting, which he does not."

Is the glam rock Haynes portrays in ""Velvet Goldmine"" an empty vocabulary of vacuous poses, or a dazzling aesthetic of operatic proportions?  ""Goldmine"" is thematically and creatively an intricate, ambitious movie.  The problem is that no matter how effective Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rice-Meyers are as the Iggy Stooge and David Bowie-like characters, they come across as blurred xeroxes of the originals."

In truth, the music held up well today and the soundtrack contains gems from Eno, Roxy Music, T. Rex and others. But onto the film - a visually entrancing collage of very pretty people looking very pretty. Lots of homoerotic romance - but a gritty undercurrent keeps the movie grounded and a convincing cast overcome a slightly gauche script that trots out one-too-many quotes from New Musical Express stories of the time (a time I remember well from my own teenage fascination with David Bowie and Roxy Music).

"bob the moo","Null","2","5","18 January 2004"," More a snapshot of a period than a story, but energetically enjoyable
","Ten years to the day after glam rock star Brian Slade staged a fake assassination live at a show and then vanished from the public eye, journalist Arthur Stuart is sent to do a `where are they now' piece on him. Unable to trace the man himself, he starts to interview old friends but, while building up a full picture of the past, his own role in the story begins to come back to him despite his best efforts to forget.<br/><br/>When I first saw this film I was overly critical of the fact that the story was pretty thin despite a reasonable narrative potential.  However I was missing the point of the film.  While it does have a basic premise that is very much a glam version of Citizen Kane, this film is far more about the time and place and experiences rather than any specific story.  The plot works on the idea of a fictional version of fact and it works well.  It is of course exaggerated for effect but it works better for it.  The 70's are before my time (or rather I was born during them) but the effect of the film is to create a lasting impression that even young audiences can buy into - although it is apparent that the film is aimed at those who were teenagers during the time; and indeed those who were seem to like this film.<br/><br/>The film is energetic and very enjoyable with an OTT pace and delivery. This makes it very easy to get into as it basically sucks you along.  At times it seems to be trying to shock (certainly a graphic suggestion in one scene where a school boy awaits buggery could have been removed or toned down), but for the majority of the time the excessive lifestyle and ideals only help to portray the sense of time and place better.  The direction is pitched to this and is flashy despite being a bit hollow; he manages to capture the glittery wonder of the time and his bias is not that bad a thing as he does show the bad side of the period (albeit in a pretty non-judgemental light).  The music is even better and it is that I enjoyed the film most for!<br/><br/>The cast is pretty mixed and don't all succeed - mostly because the film is not a character piece or even, really, a narrative - it is more of time and place.  As a result the cast mostly play wide characters or could almost be accused of doing impressions.  Rhys-Meyers' Bowie-like star is good but is very much an impression.  McGregor is very good and his character is good. Izzard is tremendous fun in a wide character but has too little screen time. Bale has the responsibility to fit it all together and he does pretty well considering that the film doesn't serve him as well as it could have done. That said, he still does a good job of being the everyman teenager of the time.  Support from Collett, Woof and the like is good and they do well with what they have.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a film to come to expecting a fantastic plot, but it is one to come to for a feel of the period, energy and good music as well as a talented cast.  It may be very much a matter of taste (and perhaps age) but I found it to be slick enough, interesting enough and, despite my age, easily enough identified to be enjoyable."

"webern","8","2","5","8 November 1998"," glorious mess, noble effort
","Given that I've come to view the arrival of a new Todd Haynes film as more of a full-blown 'event' than the average trip to the movies, I half expected ""Velvet Goldmine"", Haynes' sprawling ode to Glitter Rock, to be a set-up for disappointment.  Not so...while the film is certainly problematic at points, it's still a pretty damn terrific retina-burn, and succeeds at what all of Haynes' previous work has. Namely, showing us pictures absolutely unlike any we've seen before, and eliciting entirely unexpected emotional reactions from them. The short-lived phenom of Glitter, or glam rock, was defined by its excessive theatricality, overtly camp orchestrations of performance and dentity artifice, and a deliberate push for construct over any real notions of truth. Haynes exuberantly and exhaustively adopts this thesis as a sylistic springboard for the film, presenting an mythologized fantasy amalgam instead of even remotely attempting an accurate depiction of actual figures and events.  ""Goldmine"" opens with fairy-tale voiceover narration detailing the arrival of Oscar Wilde to England from outer space and a child's walk into a Maxfield Parrish sunset backdrop, on the other side of which lies London 1974 and the elaborately coiffed progeny of the extra-terrestrial Wilde cavorting in the streets to Brian Eno on their way to a concert by glam megastar Brian Slade (a porcelain Jonathan Rhys Meyers playing an obvious David Bowie knockoff ca. Ziggy Stardust, here given the rather Pynchonesque name of Maxwell Demon). Slade is murdered onstage, and the setting jumps to NYC 1984, where journalist and former glitter fanboy Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale) is assigned an anniversary story, and the chance to find out what may have really happened to Slade, while uncovering some of his own repressed memories on the way. Stuart's investigation mimics the structure of ""Citizen Kane"", sometimes shot-for-shot (""Kane"" is only one film reference of many here...Haynes resurrects the Barbie dolls from his own wonderful ""Superstar"" as well as the film-rupture from ""Persona"", he names one of the rock groups 'Flaming Creatures' in homage to Jack Smith, and several entire sequences land dead-center in what's definitely Ken Russell territory), allowing Slade's trajectory to icon-dom, as well as Stuart's own discovery of his sexual identity, to gradually emerge in flashback. Haynes readily admits that this narrative is largely a concession, a hook to draw the viewer into reconsidering the era as a whole, with its celebration of hype, image and consumerism and its challenging of cultural constructs and, most importantly perhaps, sexual mores. Haynes makes Stuart the emotional center of the film, and his sexual self-discovery, and gradual full-circle acknowledgement gives some grounding to the pastiche (Bale has an acute moment of lucid identification, pointing at a TV screen when Slade is on and repeating to his confused parents ""That's Me! That's Me!""), and makes this probably his most personal film since ""Dottie Gets Spanked"".  It's also, strangely enough, his brightest and most joyful piece to date, not that the Slade story isn't without its fair share of pain, but it's of a rather formulaic 'ravages of fame' sort and hardly as intriguing as Stuart's development. Unfortunately, Haynes allows Stuart's investigation to degenerate into nonsense and brings the opulence and artifice of Slade's world to the fore. But that opulence and artifice is rather astounding...the costumes by old Derek Jarman associate Sandy Powell and former Scratch Orchestra member and Eno contemporary Christopher Hobbs' production design are consistently surprising, and Haynes somehow manages to make his relatively tiny budget seem to triple itself onscreen.  And, of course, his infectuous enthusiasm for the music is the heart of the picture, suffusing virtually every frame (this is the only picture I've ever seen that accurately depicts the transcendentally pleasurable experience of bringing home new vinyl) either in the background, during concert scenes, in fantasy numbers, or, in the grand Hollywood tradition, when characters arbitrarily burst into song at inopportune moments to each other. A feral Ewan McGregor churns through ""TV Eye"" and lip-synchs ""Satellite of Love"" in an airborne convertable. Meyers does ""Baby on Fire"" justice, and performs scads of new songs written for the film which cleverly ape both the sound of the old songs and their endearing ineptitude. There's energy to spare here, and Haynes to a degree crumbles under its overwhelming weight. The disparate elements are never given a chance to properly coelesce and some ideas are more than a little confusing. Still, it's a welcome opportunity for Haynes, bless his soul, to make a picture that could almost be called 'commercial', and for him to subvert that label in his own inimitable and increasingly important fashion."

Being alive and licking during the 1970s is the best symptom for maximum sensory affinity; failing that, if your bag is Iggy Pop, T-Rex, Brian Eno, Lou Reed (matter of fact, any glam-stroked band, from The Sweet, to Slade, Kiss, or Alice Cooper) *Goldmine* will slide into your Velvet just fine.<br/><br/>Written by James Lyons and Todd Haynes and directed like a wet dream gone horribly right by Haynes, starring the cyanide-intense Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (as Bowie analog, Brian Slade) and dangerously sensual Ewan McGregor (as Iggy analog, Curt Wild), *Goldmine* is a celebration of a period that was surface Pop over layered Tart, expressed through raucous colors and pungent pan-sexuality in the form of the musical idiom we now call glam rock; a story of teen alienation and decibel-ed angst, of clutching belief in a lifestyle that seemed like a destination but ended up merely part of a longer journey. The underlying message in *Goldmine* was espoused by Bowie himself in *Changes*: ""Ooh, look out, you rock n' rollers! Pretty soon now you're gonna get older!"" <br/><br/>*Goldmine*'s success is in its evocation of the period - glam-struck London of the early 1970s  and its poignancy depicting the alienation of an insecure rock fan as he tries to be as Out There as the In Crowd. Around these backdrops, the larger story of the superstar elevated to messiah is woven.<br/><br/>Spearheading the androgynous attack on social morés is enigmatic Brian Slade aka Maxwell Demon, who fakes an on-stage assassination at the height of his popularity. We follow reporter, Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), in a *Citizen Kane*-like hunt for Slade's whereabouts a decade after his decline.<br/><br/>The young Arthur (also played by Bale) is the outcast teen who cannot assimilate into the glamster crowd he so desperately feels kinship with; finding no respite at his parents' home either, he turns to the glitter of glam for comfort. At one point, young Arthur, while quietly watching a Slade TV interview with his parents, fantasizes that he jumps up, points to Slade and shouts at his parents, ""That's me, that! That's me!"" The reality is: no matter how loud he were to shout, his parents will never hear him. From his room postered with rock idols from ceiling to floor; to the way he turntables *The Ballad of Maxwell Demon* album and excitedly commences reading the record jacket, down to his parents being utterly unable to communicate with him, *I* felt like jumping up and yelling at the *Goldmine* screen, ""That's me, that!"" <br/><br/>Eddie Izzard, as audacious manager, Jerry Devine, makes Brian Slade a household name and allies him with American superstar, Curt Wild, who becomes Slade's lover, to the chagrin of Slade's wife, Mandy (Toni Collette).<br/><br/>In more subtle and striking ways than can be recounted here, *Goldmine* is a homage to *Citizen Kane*, Oscar Wilde and David Bowie (especially Bowie, whose influence extends into the very fibers of the glam mythos itself, the character of Brian Slade alluding to Bowie by his very existence, encapsulating *Ziggy Stardust*, *The Man Who Sold the World*, *Diamond Dogs*, *Jean Genie*, and even a sly dig at Bowie's *Let's Dance* era  with the name of the film itself being the title of a Bowie B-side). The film exists in an insular universe, so none of those influences is mentioned explicitly  which makes the innuendos more interesting to identify and will make the discoveries of their references all the more fascinating to young retro-glamsters.<br/><br/>Even Slade's Maxwell Demon persona is a reference to physicist James Clerk Maxwell's thought-experiment creature (called Maxwell's Demon) which examined scenarios regarding the Second Law of Thermodynamics.<br/><br/>*Goldmine* sears with the genius of its allusions, its opening sequences a joyous primal scream to thwart the demons of conventionality. But  like the inevitable Second Law  its energy is unsustainable. Worse  it makes a bad excuse for its entropy, using formulaic dramatic arcs of washed-up, burnt-out fates, which seems disrespectful to the real-life icons of these filmic counterparts, who enjoy a longevity and success in excess to this day.<br/><br/>Brian Slade is undone by his excesses, and made to endure a Jilted Wife scene straight out of The Actor's Studio. She shrikes at him, ""You know what your problem is? You get what you want and do what you will."" Not really a problem, *per se*. Which proves conclusively that whenever someone deigns to tell you your problems, the most sensible option is to ignore them.<br/><br/>These pitfalls of rock super-stardom were to pander to ""normal"" people who believe erroneously that success is a bitch. A prime example of excess engendering success and longevity and industry clout is the man without whom this movie could never have been made  David Bowie.<br/><br/>In order to insert these negative messages, the film becomes overlong. (Damn you, MPAA!) Yet *Velvet Goldmine* somehow redeems its negativity by having Arthur discover Slade's secret - that he did not relinquish his success at all, just his space-messiah persona, swapping his serpentine sensuality for a more sterile, adult-oriented Business Model. In its final scenes, we find the film *has* been paying attention to its real life analogs and tips its hat one last time to David Bowie, the Grand Master of Reinvention."

The plot is intricate and unusual. It is one of the oddest films I have ever seen, and I would recommend being in an altered state of consciousness when you watch it.

I admit that those who doesn't feel anything special for music won't feel much attracted to Velvet Goldmine.<br/><br/>It is not a proper musical but it isn't a common movie either. It's kind of a hybrid, and neither the life-story of fictitious rock star Brian Slade is nothing special nor the narrative line is too powerful.<br/><br/>So, if you like the seventies, Ziggy Stardust, Telegram Sam, the glitter... if you like rock and roll you'll enjoy Velvet Goldmine (that's for sure).

At first viewing i found it highly confusing and the chronology a little hard to follow (you have to watch the hairstyles), i think trying to analyse and make sense of the plot only defeats the object of the piece though.

Very confusing at times, but you get really into it without even noticing. It did have some lulls in it, but not very many.

There are definitely portions of the movie that are superfluous and truthfully ridiculous, but overall it is a great dramatization of the David Bowie/Iggy Pop supposed relationship. The fact that the leads do all their own vocals also adds a dimension to the movie that brings it ever that much closer to reality."

Haynes is an artistic director trying to explore many of his own issues.  He make this film so colorful and vivid, that you can't help but being drawn into the situation.  <br/><br/>The music plays a large part in the film.  I'm not into glam at all, but I found myself really feeling the music.  Found it very cool that Ewan and Jonathan really sang for the film.  Talented!<br/><br/>Bale's Arthur has such a naivete to him.  He just wants to belong to something and relate to something.  10 years later, how ironic that Brian Slade is his newsstory.  Always, Ewan brings himself fully into the role. It kind of freaked me out that he looked so much like Kurt Cobain, but I liked crazy, electrotherapy Kurt Wilde.  I don't think I would have in a lesser actor's hands.  The same goes for Brain Slade and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.  He really has to find the humanity in a character that is extremely fake and product. You see beyond the drugged out, self-absorbed rocker and instead see a boy who wants acceptance and love.<br/><br/>In this film, the acting and look of the picture kind of overshadow the message, but what you get is a beautiful film to look at."

","I recently saw this film about a week ago and thought it was excellent. The soundtrack was amazing and the acting, beautiful. However it didn't really have much affect on me. Then one dull chemistry lesson, as my mind drifted,I suddenly began to realize what a masterpiece Velvet Goldmine actually was.<br/><br/>It portrays the whole era in a variety of clever and (according to my parents) accurate ways. The love scenes whether hetro or homo sexual where filmed almost lovingly and the speed of the film takes your on a magical journey through the glam-rock era.<br/><br/>I think that this film has been seriously under-appreciated, and i'm not saying this just because I'm a huge fan. Many seem to have problems with the fact that the film is not in chronological order, that it actually requires you to think. Because of this the film is described as a 'mess', when it is in fact just a swirl of memories and flashbacks painted in technicolor. <br/><br/>Also there are many complaints about the fact that Arthur sees Shannon with Tommy Slade, prompting him to realize the truth. Has it occurred to anyone that the flash back was purely for the audience not for authur? that the camera was focusing on her but Arthur was looking at Tommy? I don't think that Todd Haynes would create a plot hole like that without a reason behind it. I admit that many of the scenes are quite strange and random and need to be taken with a pinch of salt, but this just reflects the image of the era if anything.<br/><br/>basically this is an amazing film that needs to be seen because if it can awaken in others what it has in me then the world could be a better place, plus I desperately need people to talk about it with, at the moments it just my mum which isn't ideal!<br/><br/>please see it even if it is just for the truly awesome performances of both Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers or a bit of homosexuality and remember 'Man is least himself when he talks in his own person...

","""Velvet Goldmine"" is a journey through Rock 'N'Roll's most outrageous era! It's a elegant mixture of fiction and facts. The film is starring Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting, Moulin Rogue), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Michael Collins etc.) & Christian Bale (American Psycho etc.) among many others talented people. During the movie there's lots of Glam-rock as Iggy Pop, T REX, and Steve Harley & Cockney rebel to name a few of them. The plot is that it's been 10 years since glam-rock superstar Brian Slade (Meyers) faked his own death and vanished from the spotlight. Now it's the job of an investigating reporter, Arthur Stuart (Bale), to locate the living legend and uncover the truth behind his disappearance! ""Velvet Goldmine"" (which originally is a Bowie song) earned an Award of Merit at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. As music used in the movie is ""Sebastian"" and other's from Steve Harley, an electrifying version of Iggy's ""Gimme Danger"" performed by Ewan Mcgregor and lot's of more from perhaps the most thrilling part of the Rock-history so far.

"Oosterhartbabe","Null","1","2","2 April 2004"," A Lovely Rock Dream
","(spoilers)I absolutely love this film.  Every time I watch it, I seem to get something different from it.  At heart, it's a movie about true love-the love between Brian Slade and Curt Wilde.  The way they look at each other, and react to each other, is just astounding.  And when the illusion that Brian Slade is living in drives them apart, it's heartbreaking.  But there are so many more elements to the film, that it takes repeated viewing to see and understand them.  There's the whole 70's glam rock movement-how, as Curt Wilde remarks towards the end of the film, ""We set out to change the world, and only ended up changing ourselves"". There's the sharp hit at David Bowie-because Brian Slade is a sexual predator who's using his sexuality to get ahead at any cost. Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives a superb, understated performance as a young man on the prowl, who's bi-sexuality is simply another weapon he wields to make it to the top no matter what.  The only time that his face is open and REAL is when he sees Curt Wild.  That shy smile when he first glimpses Curt on-stage is the first open, non-calculating expression we ever see on him.  He's not trying to play an angle with Curt.  Which makes their break-up even more painful to watch. Todd Haynes was also slyly comparing the 70's and 80's with the closeted reporter played by Christian Bale.  The 70's may have been an empty, glittering decade of drugs, wild sex, and out of control behavior, but was it any worse than the drab, lifeless, conformist 80's?  The film is saying that no matter what changes, the music will go on.  It might change it's look and style, but it will continue.  And there are of course bonuses in the film-Ewan MacGregor's full frontal nudity, the glittering costumes and make-up, and Jonathan Rhys Meyer's lovely singing voice(he sings over half of the songs in the movie).  The songs alone are worth watching this film for, but the tangled layers of ideas are what makes me come back to it time and time again."

","When I rented this DVD I expected nothing but a fun, and perhaps cheesy, frolic through London's 70's glam era. Not only did it deliver on the fun, but it turned out to be a wonderfully acted, directed, and edited piece of cinema. I knew after 10 minutes of watching it that I'd stumbled upon a gem of a film. The underlying Oscar Wilde theme (his spiritual connection with glam rock and the idea that he was an alien!) added dimension to the already engaging story, and it was cleverly woven in.  Actors Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Ewan McGregor as  Bowie/Slade and Pop/Wild were virtually unrecognizable, having been transformed into bonafide rock stars. Their love story is both shallow AND touching, a rare (and almost unexplainable) combination. The second storyline involving Christian Bale as a teen fan turned journalist was very moving, and captured perfectly how a repressed and troubled kid can identify so strongly with a pop idol he's never even met. This movie with it's non-linear narative, many characters, and wild visual elements could easily have been a mess had it not been for the incredible editing, which seamlessly connected one gorgeous scene to the next, and gave the whole work a coat of highly stylized polish. The entire era has been magnificently encapsulated within this film, and it is a visual and aural spectacle that exists solely for the beauty of the experience, not for any lofty hopes of longevity -- which is precisely what glam rock was all about."
"ozellin","Null","1","2","20 December 2003"," Art
","Velvet Goldmine amazed me.  It's a perfect film.  What is especially refreshing is the playful/artfulness with which Todd Haines accentuates or dramatizes moments in a surreal way: the space ship during Arthur's tryst with Curt, when Slade and Toni Collette meet, Arthur watching Slade on tv.<br/><br/>This movie is about youth and the passing of it.  Who didn't want to be cool in high school or beyond?  I did!  It's like so real in that the characters wanted to change the world, but WHAT HAPPENS to them ten years later: Slade goes commercial, Curt stays true to himself, and Arthur finds himself: always a chronicler and admirer of the masters of glam rock.<br/><br/>This movie also has so many resonations with the Warhol scene and even the now defunct Club Makeup in LA.  When I used to read Interview Mag (before it became too mainstream: this was when I was a KID) there was an ad with two girls with powdered faces and wigs who were sipping glitter out of champagne glasses.  That image haunted me, but I guess I ended up living it out and can chronicle it with this film.<br/><br/>There seems to be a lot of talk about the sexuality of the film.  Wake up! It was the 70's, baby.  I didn't think it was particularly erotic, it was just like a backdrop for me: a fact of life.  What was great was how Haines used Jonathan Rhys-Meyer.  Finally a truly beautiful, androgynous lead that expresses the masterfulness and deadpan quality Slade had.  So few filmmakers will use a hauntingly beautiful male that this just took it to the next level of artful settings with artful people.  I can't help but think that Ewan MacGregor reminds me of Peppermint Patty.  A totally mesmerizing experience for me (isn't this what art is?).  This film is it."

","This is the most amazing, beautiful film I have ever seen.  And I'm a film student--all I do is watch movies.  This movie is visually daring, with fascinating characters and amazing acting.  If you allow it to, it can transport you to a different world, where glitter makeup and glam rock rule. I first saw this movie in 1998, not long after it came out.  After that first viewing, I knew I had seen something amazing, but it was all too much information to process at once.  I decided I had to see it again, but it wasn't until this summer (2002) that I finally gave it the attention it deserves.  I watched it in amazement, for it is truly phenomenal.  It is a gorgeous film, one that demands to be watched over and over, and one that I know will inform and inspire my work for years to come."

","I had always been a fan of David Bowie and Placebo, so when a friend of mine asked me to see this, I went for it. I was a bit pre-occupied with all of the ""bisexual"" moments, and in turn lost interest in it. Later on, I found myself downloading the whole soundtrack, and asking to borrow the DVD again. This movie has become a bit of a cult movie, filling in a space between Rocky Horror and Spinal Tap in a very odd way. The cinematography on this film is absolutely top notch, I have rarely seen a movie this vibrant! As long as the viewer has an open mind towards bisexuality and homosexuality, this movie will entertain and tell a story that is as original as it is stunning."

","For as difficult as this film may be for some to take in it is a pure work of visual art.  The costumes, setting and music depict a time that is mesmerizing.  The early '70's glitter rock era must have been quite a scene for those involved with it.  I think that Jonathan Rhys-Myers plays Brian Slade to a tee, it's as if the part was made for him.  Being a huge fan of Ewan McGregor's since Trainspotting I must admit I was thoroughly impressed with his vocal abilities.  I know it is often lame when an actor cuts a record but I honestly think Ewan has the vocal talents to pull it off."
"Luminera","Null","1","2","10 September 2002"," A film with more eye candy than you can shake a stick at.
","Velvet Goldmine is a film that results in extreme reactions.  I have personally shown it to a few people and they either love it or completely hate it.  For those out there with a taste for the everyday popcorn flick, this is not the film for you.  The plot is outlined on the basic structure of Citizen Kane.  The characters are at times dry and flat figures.  The imagery, though, is what makes this film truly astounding.  For film lovers with a taste for pure beauty on the screen, this should satisfy your appetite.  And for those who simply adore staring at a scantly clad Ewan and a made-up Johnathan Rhys-Myers, this will most certainly make you jump with glee. The plot holes and underdeveloped characters are nicely hidden behind a visual parade of glitter and glam.  This, some say, it the point.  This film, like glam rock, is tarted up to disguise its true face.  Overall the film leaves you with the urge to grab some glitter and shock the world.<br/><br/>Other recommendations: Hedwig and the Angry Inch"

","I'll admit that when my sister first showed me this movie my reaction was luke warm at best.  I barely paid attention. Then I started getting into David Bowie and Iggy Pop on my own and I decided to see the movie again about a year ago and I fell in love with it!!!  I am a stickler when it comes to semi-autobiographical movies about rock stars near and dear to my heart and Velvet Goldmine is the only movie that I feel does justice to the musicians they 'subtly' portray.  The music is absolutely fantastic and for months I couldn't get the soundtrack out of my disc man.  The glam outfits are perfect and the colors are and camera work is put together wonderfully. Perhaps the best part is the little things that are snuck into the movie that make it all the more intelligent and fun for fans. The dialouge and that is intermingled with that of Oscar Wilde quotes, the endless stream of characters that you spend time pairing to their real life counter parts, and so on.<br/><br/>And if that isn't enough Jonathan Rhys Meyers is perhaps the most gorgeous person alive and see him together with Ewan McGregor is almost too much to bare.  That itself should be enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen. This movie is a must see"

","This is a great movie if you are interested in the Glam Rock of the '70s, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, bi/homosexuality, or any combination thereof. You'll find it all in Velvet Goldmine, a movie dripping with references to the glittery years in London, full of lightly veiled allusions to Bowie and Iggy, and with lots and lots of Oscar Wilde quotes of decadence and pleasure.  The movie is beautiful just to watch, with it's amazing costumes and camera work.  But it also tells a story, a story I think, of love. Love of self, love of pleasure, love of ""becoming a star"" and ""creating a sensation"".  I highly recommend it, especially for fans of Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys-Myers, who both have great characters and portray them wonderfully.  This is one to watch over and over."

"enzedder","9","1","2","1 March 2002"," A very bisexual movie!
","Velvet Goldmine is an excellent movie whichever way you look at it.  Of course, that does depend on whether or not you yourself can associate with the themes held therein: growing up queer in a British household, idol worship, following your dreams, reliving your childhood fantasies later on in life.  This film is very bisexual - the main characters are all bi, and a lot of emphasis has been placed on the fact that they are actually bi, not gay.  It's about time a main-stream movie did this.  It's not to say that this lifestyle is an accurate portrayal of bi-life, but movies seldom are windows into the real world.  None-the-less, it captures so much of the world that bisexuals see - the sexes are equal, life is colourful, things are seen from a very open-minded perspective, yet life is complicated, we're misunderstood, and are often rejected.  This film is amazing!  It is really only let down by the fact that the American scenes are so obviously filmed in Britain, and the accents could have been better for this portrayal too."
"joeorewan","Null","1","2","27 January 2002"," Well written and acted characters
","When I first saw this movie, I didn't like it. I didn't understand the heightened world of glam, the sexuality, and the people in this movie. But then I saw it a few days ago for a second time, and this is a truly beautiful movie. The story begins when Oscar Wilde is left on a doorstep of a house, with a green jewel pinned to his blanket. He introduces the sexual revolution to the world. But it still remains quiet. The jewel is passed to one generation to the next. Then Jack Fairy inherits the jewel, gets beat up in the school yard, but smiles as the blood on his lips looks like lipstick. He can't wait to take over the world. Flash ahead to the early seventies, where the revolution is in full swing. The head of it all is Brian Slade with Curt Wilde and Jack Fairy as his supporters, but Brian lets it all go with a fake assassination. Ten years later, the revolution is forgotten. The color and wonder is gone. Arthur Stuart, a reporter, is asked to do a story about Brian Slade and where he went after the fake assassination. Through interviews of people, Arthur not only goes back to the past of Brian Slade, but to his own past. Arthur tried to forget his past, but realizes he should have embraced it. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was excellently cast as Brian Slade, an ego-maniac, yet beautiful and mysterious pop star. He's just so wonderful to look at and he can reflect so much feeling in his face. But his character, I believe, is the most despicable. Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the kind of hilarious and over-the-top Curt Wilde. I think that Curt Wilde is one of the more tragic characters of the movie. Heroin was his ""main man"", but once he was off it, Brian was his main man, but Brian's ego became too huge leaving Curt scarred. There was a love between them, but the commercial side of Brian destroyed it from ever becoming more than just a publicity stunt. Curt is the only character that ever stayed true to himself in the end. Toni Collette's Mandy Slade is also another great character. She is Brian's American wife who puts an act on as a London hipster. She's all glammed up until Brian's ego and drug addiction snaps her back to reality, and the walls she had built up are torn down and she feels hurt like Curt. And then Christian Bale's Arthur Stuart is like the icing on the cake. His is the character that goes through the biggest change. He's a wide-eyed innocent teenager who embraces glam rock and loves it because it speaks to him. He leaves his oppressive world and lives it up in London and loves it all. But the scene dies, and so does the person Arthur was. When he looks back into his past, he finds himself again, but he doesn't don make up or glitter, he wears a smile on his face and holds those moments to his heart. (Spoiler) Which is why the jewel is passed on to him in the end. He embraces the past and remembers the glory, and carries on the torch of it in his heart. That is the true revolution. Finding yourself and loving yourself. And I felt that there was a story to this movie. That the stylish images had more meaning than just stylish images. And I love it. It's great. I think its a wonderful celebration of glam rock and the world that was moving around it. 9/10<br/><br/>If you like this movie I suggest ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"". ""Rocky"" because I think it is also a celebration of glam rock and a nice last hurrah of that era, and ""Hedwig"" because it is about finding yourself beneath the glitz and glamour."

","A journalist in the 80s is asked to investigate hoax suicide of glam-rock pop giant Brian Slade (a fictional character clearly derived from David Bowie). As he reconstructs Slade's life and slowly pieces together the mystery, he is drawn back to memories of his painful adolescence. Admittedly, this sounds pretty average. Have faith. Firstly, there's an amazing cast. Christian Bale (American Psycho) plays the journalist with painful realism, Jonathan Rhys Meyers makes a captivating and charismatic Slade, Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting, Star Wars) plays crazy drug-f**ked American rock star Curt Wild, and Toni Colette (Muriel's Wedding, The Sixth Sense) gives an astonishing performance as Slade's wife, Mandy.<br/><br/>
The story is weird, very non-linear, and often surreal. What film would open with a sparkling spaceship delivering Oscar Wilde as a baby on a doorstep to cartoonish Dublin? In fact, this is a bit of a field day for Oscar Wilde, who is presented as the symbol of sexual freedom and repeatedly quoted. This film is about the post-hippie ideology, the aspirations and shortcomings of the sexual revolution, the persona of the rockstar, freedom and choice, the music industry, the creation of fame, superficiality as ideology... There are layers upon layers of meaning. Every scene has been conceived and produced with flair, the music is woven into the fabric of the story. It is funny, touching, intriguing, and utterly, utterly entertaining. You are immersed not only in a film, but a world, and by the end of the movie you will see this world with new eyes."

His performance soars above the rest of the cast and him onstage literally leaves me with goose bumps....but....come on!  Could he quite possibly look more like Kurt Cobain-one of the only great musical geniuses of my generation and my personal God?  I mean of all things, did his name have to be Curt?  Sure, I'd like just as much as anyone to see a movie about the grunge revolution and have it star Ewan McGregor, but Kurt Cobain and Iggy Pop?  Hey, I respect Iggy for what he did for music as much as the next guy, but it's not much of a comparison.  I don't know if this was a conscious relation but to have two such different scenes in music look so similar is slightly unnerving.  Otherwise, the movie is a winner.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers IS David Bowie (maybe even what Bowie never could be) and everything falls together perfectly.  Certainly the best movie about the 70s I've ever seen."

I have a feeling that much of the movie has nothing to do with reality, which it could be about. I think it could have been a good story, but somehow it just didn't come together.

A movie about fictional rock stars and the lives they lead is not a bad idea in theory.  The problem with this particular movie is that the music sucks.  As Beavis said on another occasion, it sucks so much, you need to find a new word for how bad it is. And there's so much of it, dear God.  It goes on and on and on.

Maybe he could have faked his death whilst trying to act his way out of a paper bag and expired with the effort? He'd have had me convinced! <br/><br/>Toni Collette is marvelous as always - and totally wasted on this pile. The original music is also surprisingly good.

Artistic license might dictate some liberties, but when the liberties taken go ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE WHATSOEVER, it's highly frustrating.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the film begins with an orgy of in jokes: the ""Play at maximum volume"" Ziggy reference, the young kid finding the greenish eye during a schoolyard fight (Bowie's pupil was paralyzed during just such a scene,) etc.  Great fun, but sets you up for a ride that just doesn't happen.  Cliches galore follow (the disgusted parents, drugs, sex, etc.)  I know the period, artists, and music this is based on like the back of my hand: therefore, I should not be saying ""I have no idea what's going on"" about halfway through the film.<br/><br/>No focus, no point, no follow-through.  What's up with Jack Fairy?  Why not just make him Brian Eno, like they did with the rest of the characters?  Why invent this convoluted Jarvis Cocker lookalike?  And why does Kurt Wild start out as Iggy Pop and end up as Kurt Cobain?  To show that it will happen again?

","As a fan of the lushly melodramatic, androgynous, and hedonistic style exemplified by artists like David Bowie and Queen's Freddie Mercury, I was immediately drawn to this movie. However, I was very disappointed to find that this was a film which rested on its laurels. Having already affiliated itself with the ""glam rock"" scene of the late '70's, it used no imagination in developing the characters or storyline, instead limping along rather predictably through the career of the supposed Brian Slade. Part of my problem was that, next to Ewan McGregor, I found Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, the male lead, to be decidedly uncompelling and not particularly sexy, despite all of the pouting and costume changes. Definitely worth seeing for McGregor's charged portrayal of Curt Wild, the one saving grace of the film."

","I too was a huge fan of Haynes, until I saw this film. From Superstar to Safe there's not a lemon in the bunch, but this SUCKED. Bi-sexuality was a theme of the glam era, NOT homosexuality. In creating an admittedly beautiful, excessive film along the lines of TOMMY, THE WALL, etc, (or even CABARET) Haynes trips, stumbles and eventually falls flat due to his own intellectual precociousness. The Oscar Wilde/Citizen Kane crap was tedious and pretentious. Haynes made a 'gay' film with no irony whatsoever, sucked in by his own self indulgence. Up until this point Haynes was doing some meticulous, subversive work that reached a broad audience. So what happened? This is a film designed to appeal to a very narrow audience of 30-something urban gay men who cherish their liberal arts degrees and think Focault is the greatest thing since flavored condoms. The first rule of making a musical is to shoot for a universal audience, and Haynes breaks this rule with his opening shot. Overlong, misguided, and TREMENDOUSLY DISAPPOINTING."

","While I was not alive during the glam rock era, I know this film defames those who helped make it happen.  The film makers, encapsulated by visual imagery and shock shots of homoeroticism lost sight of some of the story of the glam rock era (not to say that these weren't big factors).  This film focused itself too much on the relationships of Brian Slade and Curt Wild, who were bad portrayals of their real life counterparts.  While Jonathan Rhyes Myers and Ewan MacGregor passed themselves off easily as David Bowie and Iggy Pop, respectively, they failed to capture the emotions and feelings of the characters or of the period.  Christian Bale's character, the most interesting of the three gets little screen time of his own.  The film's most intriguing qualities are the visuals and the finale with Christian Bale and Ewan MacGregor, perhaps stating clearly one of the most obvious things to come from the artists of the glam era: ""We set out to change the world and ended up changing ourselves.""  If the rest of the movie would have followed suit, it would have been fantastic.  I can see why Bowie wouldn't lend his name to this fractured fictitious tale of one of music's most notorious eras."

It had all the right ingredients; great cast, fabulous outfits, it's about GLAM ROCK for goodness sake! But alas, what this film was seriously lacking in was plot. Velvet Goldmine tells the tale of Brian Slade, a pop icon in the 1970s bearing an uncanny resemblance to David Bowie, whose career takes a severe nose-dive after he fakes his own death on stage. <br/><br/>The picture revolves around a newspaper reporter ten years later (Who was once a fan of Brian Slade, and was at the gig of the 'shooting hoax'), assigned to find out 'exactly what happened'. What follows are an hour and a half of confusing and seemingly irrelevant flashbacks, poorly scripted and dull interviews, leading to a dull and fairly predictable finish. I should stress again that I am a big fan of both the Glam Rock era, and all of the actors in this film, so I didn't begin watching this film with any preconceptions of bad-ness.

I enjoyed it because it reminded me of my teenage years, though I was a teenager in the 90's, I was into 'glam' via Suede and the Manics, though obviously in no way as extreme as people were in the 70's. I also enjoyed the films visual flair, its bright chirpiness-it's a rare thing for Britain to be represented in this way, I guess only an American could do it. And it kinda passed by quickly with no boring parts. It's very similar to, but not as good as, Almost Famous. What I didn't like about this film is that I didn't give two hoots about any of the characters. It was also too 'in-yer-face' at times and some subtlety would have been nice. And I'm not sure if Ewan Mcgregor acted really badly in this or if his lines were so crap he didn't have much choice. Bale does a good job though. I think the film fails most of all by not knowing what it wants to be, fiction or fact. while the characters and some situations are obviously based on Bowie/Pop, the rest of the film is quite extreme in it's fictionalisation and this doesn't do it any favours. This means the film has no target audience - Anyone that lived in the 70's might want to watch it to be 'taken back' and to reminisce, but will be (and have been) disappointed by it's lack of factual foundation. Anyone not from the 70's might have an interest in watching it if they are a fan of 70's glam, and would like to see a film that represents those times (kinda like how The Doors film chronicles 'The Doors') but again, the fact that the facts are obscured, and that this really isn't a masterpiece, means there's no real point in watching it."

","""Velvet Goldmine"" wisely makes itself difficult to pin down; to escape criticism, it self-inoculates. It's good to defy description, but let's try. The film is a depiction of the 1970s rock fad alternately known as ""glam"" or ""glitter"" rock. The New York Dolls (herein, quaintly represented by ""Personality Crisis"") were early proponents, but the Queen of the movement became David Bowie. This film's main player is Jonathan Rhys Meyers (as Brian Slade). He impersonates the Bowie-type role well, but the character is elusive and difficult to understand. And, what we have here is a conglomerate...<br/><br/>""Velvet Goldmine"" is a Bowie tune. In a way, he did turn Lou Reed's ""Velvet Underground"" into a Goldmine. The plot structure follows Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" (1941). Former glam-fan and present day reporter Christian Bale (as Arthur Stuart) assumes the storytelling role. He searches for Mr. Meyers, who vanished when disappointed fans learned his death was faked. Think about that for a moment and you'd vanish, too. Meyers is washed-up and somewhat slightly dazed. In the flashback scenes, Mr. Bale looks more amusing than authentic. Toni Collette (as Mandy) does well...<br/><br/>The other major player is Ewan McGregor (as Curt Wild). He's mostly Iggy Pop, but Mr. McGregor looks more like Kurt Cobain. This is probably a good thing, considering. McGregor does look better after taking off all his clothes, and he doesn't excrete anything on the audience. So much for realism. All of this is the brainchild of writer-director Todd Haynes, who nicely acknowledges glam grand-daddy Little Richard. Oscar Wilde also receives special attention. Everything in ""Velvet Goldmine"" looks nice but adds nothing bigger than the fact that Mr. Haynes is an excellent filmmaker.<br/><br/>******* Velvet Goldmine (5/21/98) Todd Haynes ~ Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Ewan McGregor, Christian Bale, Toni Collette"

The son of a cantor, Weill displayed musical talent early on. By the time he was twelve, he was composing and mounting concerts and dramatic works in the hall above his family's quarters in the Gemeindehaus. During the First World War, the teenage Weill was conscripted as a substitute accompanist at the Dessau Court Theater. After studying theory and composition with Albert Bing, Kapellmeister of the Theater, Weill enrolled at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik, but found the conservative training and the infrequent lessons with Engelbert Humperdinck too stifling. After a season as conductor of the newly formed municipal theater in Lüdenscheid, he returned to Berlin and was accepted into Ferruccio Busoni's master class in composition. He supported himself through a wide range of musical occupations, from playing organ in a synagogue to piano in a Bierkeller, by tutoring students (including Claudio Arrau and Maurice Abravanel) in music theory, and, later, by contributing music criticism to Der deutsche Rundfunk, the weekly program journal of the German radio."

Since it places style over substance, I don't think the film has dated very well at all, which is frightening since it's only six years old; somehow it feels much older than that, which is not a good thing in a film that tries to preserve an already-dated movement for all posterity. In particular, the ""music video"" sequences are not only pretty anachronistic and/or pointless but look absolutely silly now. There are sizeable goofs, gaping plot holes, what little plot there is trods on and on, and in general I feel like I'm being spoon-fed and cliché-beaten far too often while watching this film. The Tommy Stone character, a sort of ridiculous, generic 80s pop-superstar caricature whose musical style or appeal is never shown or explained whatsoever (while every third person on the street is wearing a Tommy Stone mask-- they didn't even do this for Michael Jackson, yo!), is pretty indicative of how this film goes wrong. <br/><br/>Ewan McGregor's performance, as almost everyone has pointed out, is pretty great... although he DOES look way too much like Kurt Cobain, and I think his character paints Iggy Pop in a far-too-positive light. He also upstages pretty much everybody else on screen, including the essentially unlikeable reporter that so many others here seem to enjoy. Everybody else turns in flat or laughably overdone performances (sometimes both!).<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this movie *is* really great and is the only thing that keeps the film from totally collapsing. Lots of especially choice Eno cuts, a bunch of equally wonderful stuff from T. Rex and Roxy Music, some pretty well-done nuevo-glam facsimiles from my boys in Shudder to Think (no one else would have been nearly so capable!), an all-star cast for the on-screen bands (holy cow-- ""the Wylde Rats"" include original Stooge Ron Asheton... not to mention Mike Watt, Thurston Moore, Steve Shelley, and Don Fleming!), and even a couple of period covers that SHOULD have come off as sacrilegious travesties but manage to largely succeed. <br/><br/>This movie is, I will admit, one of the very few movies that can make gay life look slightly interesting and even a little arousing from a mostly-heterosexual viewer's perspective. But I think that, had the actual subject (glam rock, of course!) been less interesting and the music less well-done, this movie would have been a major dud. I do sort of take issue as well with the ""work of fiction based on real-life characters"" thing, because-- as with the equally fictional Amadeus-- many folks will go into this movie knowing next to nothing about the artists on whom the characters are closely modeled, and will leave thinking that SOMETHING like this must've actually happened. <br/><br/>Oh, and for a really good time, freeze-frame the DVD every time a newspaper article is shown on-screen and check out the actual text of the article (I was especially amused by the ""story"" on Slade's cocaine arrest).

Despite a decidedly wobbly accent, Ewan McGregor pulls off a reasonable Curt Wilde, leaping like an epileptic salmon and writhing on the stage floor like an Iggy Pop clone. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is suitably androgenous, if a little bland. A few cameos are amusing- such as when you realize that yes, that IS Thom Yorke's voice Rhys Meyers is miming to, and that helium-voiced singer that looks an awful lot like Brian Molko really is Brian Molko..

The one thing that I don't understand about Velvet Goldmine is the fictionalization of David Bowie and Iggy Pop.  Because the characters of Brian and Curt are virtually identical to their counterparts, it seems unnecessary for them to be Brian and Curt rather than David and Iggy.  There is a sort of inescapable tension in the proximity of the fictional characters to the real rock stars.  Ewan McGregor does a damn good Iggy and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is spot on as Bowie.  They are so good in fact, that it is hard to think of the characters as Brian and Curt.  This seems a weakness in the film, especially since it requires a soundtrack of (appropriately) fictional songs.  These songs are not bad, but they aren't the originals either.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I do wonder how much more I would have enjoyed it had it not resorted to fiction in the face of a marvelous true story..."

","This wasn't my type movie, but after seeing JRM in Gormenghast for the first time ever I wanted to see more of his work, and now have seen nearly everything he's been in.  My friends and family and especially my husband can't stand this actor whom I adore.  I think he's a talented person.  So far my favorite is his character in The Governess starring Minnie Driver. This Velvet Goldmine movie is too loosely based on David Bowie and I don't like that being that I was a teen when he was becoming famous.  I was shocked by some of the scenes JRM and Ewan played in this film, but then I saw the movie Wilde and it makes Velvet Goldmine look like bubble gum.  My family goes around telling everyone I rent gay porn now, and I get weird looks from hubby.  How funny.  I'll tell you what else is humorous-- I've read a lot of comments on this movie with people complaining JRM seemed icy and cold in this flick.  Guess what folks that was his character.  So I see he is the talented actor I thought after all.  No. This wasn't my line of movies but I enjoyed the colors, music, and his acting.  He is an elusive and mysterious character even in real life.  That's why he is so intriguing...."

","For me, the most compelling of the story's characters is Arthur.  The fact that--as ""The Onion"" pointed out--in the investigation of Brian Slade's career we learn more about Arthur than about Slade is a fresh innovation to the tried-and-true ""Citizen Cane"" formula.  The debate over the culmination of his hero-worship relationship with Curt Wild will reign in my head for many a year."

","If you liked ""The Linguini Incident"" you might be in the niche for this movie.<br/><br/>Velvet Goldmine is completely about visual style.  The characters are driven by looks and moves more than anything else, trampling over emotions and any other humanistic qualities in many cases.  That's about the only thing this movie can be praised for delivering effectively.  <br/><br/>The film itself is done the same way, unashamedly it would seem, and the audience for whom it was intended for likely doesn't care.  Again, image means everything.  Who needs a plot?  <br/><br/>In a nutshell, take the quirky characters from The Linguini Incident and imagine who those characters would idolize, then make a movie about them. That's pretty much what Velvet Goldmine is.  If that's your cup of tea this might be worth a look.  Otherwise, I recommend you stay far far away."

","After watching this movie for about ten minutes I had to rewind the video and start again...I was THAT lost.  I could not make the connection between Oscar Wilde and glam rock and I still think it is a stretch.  It was plenty visual, but who could make head or tails out of the story line?  Who was shagging who? Maybe decadence is the name of the game, but I'd like to distinguish one character from another (all that glitter dust, my gawd).  One thing I will say for it, it ""aroused"" my attention."

","But that doesn't make it a great movie(e.g. 2001). The performances were great especially McGregor(who's pretty much good in everything)as an obvious play on Iggy Pop, and Izzard as a cross between the business savvy of Brian Epstein and the exploitation skills of Malcom McClaran. Meyers however as the Bowie-ish Brian Slade is far too distant a character to get really interested in. Great soundtrack however, Oscar nominated costumes, and a good sense of overall style keep things interesting if not completley fresh."

","This was one of the movies on my list of Ewan Mcgregor films to see, so.. well I saw it.  I'm not sure whether I liked it or not.  The second time around, I simply watched the parts Ewan was in and fast-forwarded through the rest.  I'm also a big fan of Christian Bale, but I do not like Jonathan Rhys-Meyer at all! I haven't seen any other films he is in, so I'm not sure if this is a good film to base my opinion on, but he really bugs me now.<br/><br/>A point to bring up that I'm not sure if anybody knows is that both Ewan and Jonathan sang those songs in the movie.  Every time you saw their lips moving, they were singing.  That's nice to see a movie actually allow the speaking actors to sing.  I was impressed.<br/><br/>It was very difficult to sink back to reality after this bright and glittery film.. Boy, aren't the 90's different?

","I have to disagree with the Dutchman who reviewed the film, likening it to David Bowie. The film is in no way based on Bowies life whatsoever, or Iggy Pops, or Marc Bolans. As you know, if you have studied Bowie's life as close as I have, he did not have a sexual relationship with Igyy Pop, and it remains to be seen whether he did with Bolan, although he is rumoured to have. The film has a poor soundtrack by new artists that has taken away all association with real life stars such as Bowie and Bolan. Rhys Meyers character is purely fictitious so please stop trying to liken him to Bowie which he is not, is his character called Bowie?, no, so leave the great man out of it. Basically the film is poor, the soundtrack is poor, wait until the update of the real god of glam David Bowies ziggy stardust remake next year."

","One definite rule of thumb in the last 25 years. Don't watch a film with David Bowie in it. This counts double for a film actually about him.<br/><br/>Set extensively in London in the early 70s, Velvet Goldmine charts the fortunes of glam-rock star and son of a Brummie roof-tiler Brian Slade (Rhys-Meyer playing Bowie), who vanished after a fake assassination attempt on his life went aubergine-shaped in 1974.<br/><br/>Using an avowedly Citizen-Kane framing device, director Haynes (previous work Safe) has old glam-devotee journalist Arthur Stuart (Bale) writing a story on the 10th anniversary of the key event in glam rock. What ensues is arguably the hugest pile of impenetrable, unfathomable nonsense since Pink Floyd's The Wall.<br/><br/>Skipping around more than a dodgy market stall vinyl record, Haynes implies that a green jewel (the 'Rosebud' device used throughout), which was deposited by a UFO as a gift to Oscar Wilde in 1854, was the acorn of glam rock. Don't ask? It's gibberish. Anyhow, our man Slade (a predatory buggerer of schoolboys in his spare time), encounters a dude named Jack Fairy, and hey presto becomes Maxwell Demon and inherits the power of glam.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the cocaine trail, Brian marries Mandy (Collette) and falls in love with trailer trash rock star Curt Wild (McGregor). Cue lots of ""untamed"" concert gallivanting, depravity and glitter. Those obsessed with the Trainspotting star will no doubt revel in the Scotsman showing off his arse and tackle (not exactly ideal preparation for Star Wars) and obsessives may enjoy spotting some old record sleeves, but there's not a lot else of note.<br/><br/>At two hours, Velvet Goldmine feels interminably long, features the sort of prize pillocks you'd travel across several oceans to avoid and worst of all singularly lacks character development, empathy and humour."

","I was really disappointed by Velvet Goldmine.  I'm a huge Bowie fan and I heard that this was well researched, but not a biography.  The scenery and the costumes are amazing.  I haven't seen such outrageous costumes since Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.  Ewan McGregor is terrific as Curt Wild.  He IS sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  I liked  a lot of things about this movie like Ewan, the music, and the visuals.  Visually, the movie is stunning. Toni Collette and Eddie Izzard also give good performances but Jonathon Rhys-Meyers was terrible.  The movie doesn't come together as a cohesive whole quite as well as it should.  I didn't understand what Jack Fairy and Oscar Wild really had to do with the movie.  The visuals also made you feel removed from the characters, with the exception of Curt Wild.  Without an emotional core, this movie rings hollow.  It's the cinematic equivalent of a pinata."

","Two young men, one British, one American, become international superstars in the early '70s, practicing a now-ignored musical style known as glam-rock. Glam rock, in case you had forgotten, is forgettable power-trio ballads performed by heavily mascara-ed, sequin-wearing bi-sexual males.  David Bowie spent a few years in this phase and skipped out, but other acts, like Mott the Hoople and Gary Glitter, remained true believers, trundling out artery-clogging double concept albums well into the 1970s.<br/><br/>The David Bowie-based character is Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Davies). There's also American Curt Wild (Ewan MacGregor), whose career is languishing after a brief stint as headman of a proto-punk MC5-like garage band in the early 1970s.  Slade re-animates Wild's career, brings him on tour, slathers him in mascara, sequins, and feathers, and, naturally, copulates with him.  This pretty dull story is told from the perspective of an English journalist, who's sent to determine what has become of Slade in 1984, long after he has dropped off the celebrity radar screen.  The assignment rekindles the journalist's misguided teenage love affair with glam rock, much to the audience's chagrin.<br/><br/>The story is mainly told in voice-over interviews with people who knew Slade in the 1970s.  By far the most tiresome of these is from Slade's ex-wife Mandy (Toni Collette), who is a member of perhaps the most annoying demographic on earth -- talentless, bitter ex-spouses of rock stars.  In a whiny, sulky voice, she complains about how when she and Slade married in the early 70s, there was, like, a groovy feeling of sexual liberation in the air.  They were divorced after it got a little old watching Slade shellac his mind with galaxies of narcotics while frenetically rogering anything on two legs -- except, it seems, her (What did she expect?).  Yawn. The other voice-overs are a little more promising, but hers is by far the most prominent.  The accompanying flashbacks feature enough eye-makeup, fornication, drugs, polyester, and sexual ambiguity to last this viewer a lifetime.<br/><br/>The script is, for the most part, pretentious claptrap.  Instead of investing the characters with any recognizable character traits (much less sympathetic ones), director Todd Haynes has them prance around striking poses, occasionally uttering vapid, oh-so-clever observations about the nature of celebrity.  (""The first duty in life is to create an image.  The second duty is yet to be determined."")  The only interesting thing about them is the way they dress, and that gets old pretty damned quick.  I suppose the underlying theme here is that there's no point in getting to know these characters under the surface because their entire lives are devoted to cultivating their external appearance.  Whatever sociological accuracy this theory may have, it's fatal to the narrative.  Because these dumb, self-involved, inarticulate sybarites offer nothing to hold the viewer's interest, their little spats and couplings and musical mincings are about as interesting as Canadian Parliament.  Nevertheless, Haynes presents these doings with PBS-documentary touches (spinning newspaper headlines, excerpts of press conferences and news reports), that invest them with a sense of fake solemnity.<br/><br/>Even if the characters generated a spark of interest, the movie is replete with turgid, self-indulgent musical set pieces that cry out for the cutting-room floor.  The audience is forced to watch movie actors perform contemporary pastiches of not-terribly-good glam-rock songs.  Mind you, these are not fragments of performances -- you must sit through the entire song, which seems to take as long as 7 or 8 minutes.  Whatever narrative flow the movie might have had is terminally constipated by these interludes of sheer torpor.  I left the theater and was surprised to find the movie had only lasted two hours, since it seemed like a good three.<br/><br/>A complete wash.<br/><br/>BA"

","The first time I saw this movie, I hated it.  I totally didn't get the plot, Ewan McGregor (my reason for renting it in the first place) was hardly in it, and it jumped around a lot.  But for some reason, I was compelled to watch it again.  I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>There are plenty of reviews that wrote about what the movie's plot was. I'm writing to say: IGNORE THE PLOT.  I mean, of course, it's obviously based on David Bowie's relationship to Anna, and also to Iggy Pop... but the characters, while bearing striking resemblance to those glam-rock icons, are ""fiction"".  There are a million little stories to sidetrack you in this movie; my advice: go with it.  Just ignore the plot, don't try to make sense of it- it's not too well-written or thought out.<br/><br/>But- I'm sorry- how sexy is Jonathan Rhys Meyers?  He plays the lead character, a Bowie-esque rocker, whose alter-ego, Maxwell Demon, ends up consuming him.  And he looks extremely sexy in tight purple velvet pants.<br/><br/>
The actors in this movie are all great, actually- the three male leads (McGregor, Meyers, and Christian Bale) are beautiful and convincing, and Toni Collete did a great job as well.  The music in this film totally blew me away- Roxy Music, Brian Eno, Lou Reed, Placebo, and some actors doing their own vocals.  Of course, they dubbed over a lot of Jonathan Rhys Meyers's singing with the voice of Thom Yorke from Radiohead, but all is forgiven.  :)<br/><br/>The movie is a rock opera of sorts, dedicated to glam rock.  So don't see it if you're homophobic- there are several gay relationships portrayed, keeping with the era's sexual revolution.  Don't see it if you're into plot-driven stuff, either.  But if you go into this open-minded, maybe watch it twice or so... you might turn out to be one of those people that's incredibly touched and moved by this movie.  I know I'm one of 'em.  The images and sounds really stay with you, though, love the movie or hate it.  And one more time- Jonathan Rhys Meyers is incredibly sexy and talented as Brian Slade, and he's worth watching the movie for!!!"

It meanders without regard of an actual timeline, the plot is ludicrous, and any ""message"" it might have had is completely lost during the long, boring music interludes.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie makers did a fine job of capturing the look of glam rock, but they should have just produced a video - not this trainwreck of a movie.<br/><br/>The performances are uninhibited - take that as either good or bad.

","This is a bizarre paradox of a movie which, although pretty bad, made me want to rent it again. Ryhes Myers is pretty wooden, as is Ewan McGregor (this is his worst performance I've seen), the script meanders and jumps around, the dialogue isn't great, and I really don't want to see Ewan McGregor naked... So why did I rent it twice? As people have said, its a brilliantly done, visually. The music is great, mixing classic Brian Eno and Iggy Pop and some okay new stuff. Anywhere in the movie centered around someone singing a song is golden. It breaks the continuity of the movie, but its looks great. Oh, and this is a movie you need to watch twice. Its not well written, so it doesn't make a lot of sense the first time around, but the second time around it kinda does. If you like glam rock music, watch this movie. If you don't, rent Trainspotting. Final verdict: Should have been rewritten a few times, and Brian Slade should have been recast."
