","With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved."
"bolender-1","Null","744","1069","5 December 2004"," My take on this
","At first, I didn't feel much of a need to comment on the film, since so many others have written and have said so many things. But I think there are some really important points to made, and I haven't seen anyone make them. So here I am writing.<br/><br/>In my opinion, almost everyone misunderstood the relationship between Hephaistion and Alexander. In the modern world, especially in the West, two men are either very close to each other, sleep together, and have sex, or they keep a good comfortable distance from each other and, if they're friendly, might punch each other on the arm. In this film, we see a relationship that is hard for most people today to understand, namely a passionate love relationship between two men in which sex is not very important and possibly even absent.<br/><br/>Aristotle essentially explained the whole film near the beginning when he told the young couple something like the following, as best I can remember it, ""When two men lie together in lust, it is over indulgence. But when two men lie together in purity, they can perform wonders."" Or something like that. Given what I know of that culture, I am sure that ""in purity"" means no sex, or at least very little. That's why we never see them kiss. In the film, as in many older films, kissing is a metaphor for sex. Even when Alexander kisses his mother, it refers to the idea of sex. That's why Alexander kisses Bagoas, but not Hephaistion.<br/><br/>Now I'm not sure if the real historical Aristotle would have made that remark. That's not exactly what he says about homosexuality in the Nicomachean Ethics. But the remark is plausible enough since Alexander could easily have heard such an idea during his youth. Plato (before Aristotle) expressed that idea, and Zeno of Citium (after Aristotle) did too. So even if Aristotle never said this to Alexander, it is plausible enough that the idea was in the air and that Alexander heard it from someone or other.<br/><br/>Some have complained that the ""homosexuality"" (assuming that A's relationship with Heph. should even be called that) was thrown in their faces too much. But it's crucial to the plot. Stone is hypothesizing that Hephaistion was essential for what Alexander did. Further, it's a standard Hollywood convention to juxtapose a love story with some great political, military, or otherwise grand event. There are tons of examples. Titanic, Enemy at the Gates, Gone with the Wind, ... the list could go on forever. It really is homophobic to complain about Stone continually going back to this theme, because he has a perfectly good artistic reason to do it.<br/><br/>A few more details: Alexander's hair. I think that Stone was trying to make Alexander look like Martin Potter in Satyricon -- a nod to Fellini.<br/><br/>Alexander's accent and soft appearance. Another nod to a great director passed on, this time Stanley Kubrick. Farrel really looks a lot like Ryan O'Neil in Barry Lyndon. In fact, he really looks like a Ryan O'Neill / Martin Potter coalescence. I think it's deliberate.<br/><br/>The softness of Alexander's personality. In a lot of scenes it made sense. He was gentle enough to know how to approach Bucephalus and tame him without scaring him. He was open minded enough to adopt a lot of Persian culture and encourage intermarriage, while the other more ""he-man"" folks around him were less comfortable with the idea.<br/><br/>Yes, if you haven't figured it out by now, I do like the film. People's hatred of the film is hard for me to understand."
"mharrsch-1","7","157","223","14 December 2004"," Stone stumbles over Alexander
","When ""Gladiator"" stirred a latent interest in films about the ancient world I was so hopeful we would finally be able to enjoy some exciting cinema about my favorite time period. I have not been totally disappointed. USA Television network has given us Attila, Caesar, and Helen of Troy - not without flaws but solid efforts. Wolfgang Peterson's ""Troy"" did not resemble the Iliad I had studied but I appreciated the performances of Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. Brukheimer's ""King Arthur"" could have used more experienced epic direction but was loosely based on historical accounts of Sarmatian auxiliaries and their commanders in late Roman Britain and I liked the grittier result to the fairy tale legends of my childhood. Then I heard about Oliver Stone's production of ""Alexander"" and I was sure we would have a film of the caliber of ""Ben Hur"". Unfortunately, Stone managed to take what should have been a ready-made screenplay and solid performances by Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and Colin Farrel and imparted as much insight into the character and charisma of the world's most famous conqueror and military genius as the images of shadowy figures thrashing about in the blinding dust of Stone's Gaugamela.<br/><br/>His opening sequence with Anthony Hopkins, as Ptolemy I, droning on about his memories of Alexander was more protracted than a prologue to a History Channel documentary. In fact, I heard a man behind me mutter something like ""I came to watch a movie not the History Channel!"" <br/><br/>Stone's next major error was to omit any scenes of Philip's military prowess. ""The Lion of Macedon"" was as much a military genius as his celebrated son but Stone leaves us with little more than an impression he was a drunken lout. The omission of the battle of Charonea was nothing short of a blunder since it epitomized the sharing of military experience between father and son with Philip masterminding the battle and Alexander, a mere 18-years old, leading the cavalry in a critical maneuver to assure the victory. Stone handles Alexander's tutelage by Aristotle clumsily as well. Instead of focusing on Alexander's insatiable curiosity about the world around him and how Aristotle nurtured his intellect, we see a brief scene where Aristotle is essentially defending Alexander's friendship with Hephaistion to a sneering Cassander. During Alexander's brief lifetime, Alexander maintained his relationship with his tutor for years, sending examples of plants and animals from the lands he conquered back to Aristotle for study.<br/><br/>Then to skip both the battles of the Granicus River and Issus totally left me aghast. I think the most damaging omission was the battle of Issus. It is at Issus that Alexander first confronts Darius himself and Darius flees from the Macedonian onslaught, leaving his wife and daughters to Alexander's mercy. When Stone depicts Darius running from Alexander at Gaugamela it is done in such a way that the audience doesn't perceive it to be a lack of personal courage but just an escape, especially without the knowledge that Darius had broken and run from Alexander before.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Gaugamela was not executed in a way that illuminated Alexander's strategy and daring. Stone should have watched ""Alexander: The Art of War"" produced by the Discovery Channel for better insight.<br/><br/>Stone treats us to only one last battle scene in India at the Hydapses River. Again, it looks more like a running jungle battle vis-a-vis Vietnam than a carefully strategized battle where Alexander had to execute a tenuous river crossing below the expected battle site to draw some of King Porus' forces away from the center and enable Alexander's infantry to be effective. <br/><br/>As for the near mortal wound, Alexander was wounded at the siege of Malia, a fortified town on the way back to the Indian Ocean. He dashed over the ramparts of the town before his main force could catch up to him and he wound up cut off and, with three other companions, cornered and fighting for his life. Two of his companions were killed and a severely wounded Alexander is protected by the last remaining companion bearing the shield Alexander had supposedly taken from the grave of Achilles at Troy - another missed cinematic opportunity!<br/><br/>As for Alexander's bisexuality, I objected to Stone's portrayal of Hephaistion as an eye-linered catamite walking around in billowing robes. Hephaistion was as skilled a warrior as Alexander and a successful commander in his own right. Maybe Stone could not bring himself to accept a deep relationship between two very masculine men.<br/><br/>Now, I can only hope that the vehicle starring Leonardo diCaprio is produced or HBO gives Alexander the treatment he deserves with a blockbuster miniseries like ""Band of Brothers""."

","The audience is not being able to understand the difference between  ancient and modern morals, but to be honest I don't care about the  wider audience. Why should Oliver have to sugarcoat and alter his work  simply because the 'MTV generation' and mass TV watchers of the United  States don't know their history? I say he shouldn't. Their ignorance is  *their* problem, not Oliver's.  In a long shot, Oliver Stone chose to create a historically accurate  film around the life of a man, both fact and fiction, who created the  gateway for humanity's future path. Many will not appreciate this film,  because their minds are too stuffed with current calamity to realize  where their freedoms and dreams of equality originated from.   This is a brilliant film, which was portrayed correctly, from a  personable point of view, to create the character of Alexander in the  manner in which he lived; uninhibited by other influences save those  whom he loved and knew were trustworthy. This movie is about the  origins not only of the Western mind and intellect, but also plan  larger into the scheme of the man who saw and dreamt of the future- a  world which accepted each other and lived together in diversity in  harmony. This man was Alexander-- our Western father.   Like it, hate it; it doesn't really matter. The fact is, Oliver Stone  brought to his team of experts internationally respected historians to  make this film as accurate historically as possible. This should not go  without notice. Colin Farrell, a known Irish- now Hollywood loverboy,  does indeed display the heart and integrity of a natural born leader.  He has lead this cast in an epic performance, well past his personal  years and experience. He is worthy of praise in his portrayal of  Alexander.   The movie is fantastic;  Well done, Olivier, Colin, etc... Well done."
"kirangnsh","1","130","204","20 August 2005"," Utterly preposterous movie on the greatest king
","By Zeus, this movie is awful! The movie is not just scripted poorly, it is directed pathetically! Mr.Stone completely loses grip on story telling... and by at the end of the movie, is clueless about what he wanted to say.<br/><br/>What put me off was neither the director's *obsession* to prove Alexander's sexual orientation, nor the plethora of inaccuracies/biased opinions through out the movie. It was the complete lack of representing why Alexander was ""Alexander The Great"". I would have endured it better if it were a documentary, with its purposes stated upfront.<br/><br/>Great men are so few; and when somebody goes ahead and downplays such a great person with their frivolous 'research' and story writing, it is outright annoying. I strongly believe that our next generation should learn from the great souls of the past. And if a director, when has such an opportunity, makes a bum of himself/herself, it is very, very irritating.<br/><br/>I am from India, where Alexander appears in our history text books at various grades at school. The fervor that the name Alexander brought to me when I was in school, which is nearly forty years ago, is simply indescribable. We Asians love him, adore him. We call him Sikandar, and the word stands for 'the heroic', 'the majestic', 'the king'. Rather than making the movie focus on his greatness - valor, ambition, respect for a fellow human being, and ultimately success in so many aspects of life, the movie was made about the most unimportant aspects of his life. <br/><br/>And for the records, Alexander won against the Indian kings, the last one being Porus. Alexander gave back the kingdom to Porus, for the courage shown by him after Alexander captured and 'interrogated' him. After this last war, Alexander's army was tired, and did not want to take on the army of Magadha, and Alexander returned home. The movie from this point on, does not even deserve comments.<br/><br/>Alexander supposedly asked his hands to placed in display after his death, showing the people ""the one who conquered the world, after death, left empty handed"". Instead of the ending of the movie being something to that effect, it was the Ptolemy's soliloquy at the end, which was... AARGH! absolutely absurd."
"thunderzephyr","10","436","745","27 November 2004"," A Totally Different Viewing.
","Last night I saw the movie a second time, with my 20 year old son. The audience was of an entirely different demographic than the first viewing (which was an advance screening). The average age of the audience was about 35-45, with not too many teens in there. And guess what? Besides the fact that the entire theatre was PACKED, there was absolutely not a sound from the audience...like they were breathless. No snickering at blond hair, eyeliner, sultry looks from Bagoas, or any of the things that drew slight laughs when I saw it for the first time. It bolstered my hope that as time goes on and more people see it, there will be a more favorable opinion of it. <br/><br/>I myself liked the movie a whole lot more the second time around. I watched different things this time...paid more attention to the sets and the other characters behind and around whoever was the primary action of the moment. I listened to the narration more closely, and enjoyed the film much more this time.<br/><br/>Response from my 20 year old son, who wasn't just trying to be nice to his old mom, was very positive. He even thought that the assassination scene was fine where it was because it related better to what was going on in Alexander's head at the time. <br/><br/>I highly recommend a second (at least) viewing at a theatre with a very good sound system. I realized I had missed some of the dialogue and narration because the 1st theatre's sound system was horrible.<br/><br/>P.S. Kudos to Mr. Stone for his lifetime achievement award in Sweden. They don't give those out to just anyone, you know?"
"WChewIII","9","373","639","29 December 2004"," Hard to digest for hoi polloi, but true to history and Greek epic and tragedy
","Oliver Stone consulted Robin Lane Foxe, Oxford historian and the premier Alexander expert, before making this film. It shows. The film certainly ranks as one of the closest-to-the-real-story Hollywood historical mega-films. To viewers with any background in Aristotelian drama and the Greek epic, it will immediately become clear that Stone has tried hard to emulate the epic form while integrating the culture of the Greek tragedy into his film. There is plenty of fear and pity here and there are plenty of tragic elements. The aging Ptolemy as narrator even takes on some of the functions of the chorus/choir. Tragic destiny in a larger-than-life man plagued by doubts over his own decisions, his consuming passions, is the universal here; the gripping story of Alexander the historical incidental, as it were. Not surprisingly, characterization and character interaction must loom large. Which explains the numerous and lengthy monologues and dialogues. Bravo, Mr Stone. Those who can appreciate will. But I fear that hoi polloi will not appreciate. They will simply fail to understand. Postscript: If there were any episodes in Alexander's life I missed and would have liked included (at the risk of making this film even longer) it would have been the Gordian Knot and the Oasis of Siwa."

","i laughed out loud while watching this movie. i haven't enjoyed all of Oliver Stone's films so i'll give him this one. this movie left me wondering several things: 1) was Alexander's mother born before, or at the same time as her son?(and why did she go to a transylvanian voice coach?) 2) how much hydrogen peroxide was in the bleach Colin used? 3) did Val use plasticine on his face in the hopes of being unrecognizable? 4) did anyone go to the library to help with the pacing of this film? you know, those buildings with books in them? 5) was Bucephalous black, or white? did anyone care? (he was the best actor anyways) 6) if i had 9 figures to spend making a movie, would it have been this bad? (more proof that throwing money at a film doesn't do the trick) 7) did the people making this film know it was about Alexander the GREAT? did they know he was an extraordinary leader? or did someone tell them he was an angst-filled whiner? (see question #4) this film has my vote at the razzies this year for worst film. as i said i found myself laughing out loud. other leads turned the film down. if Alexander had been played by David Spade or Paulie Shore, i may have been more charitable of this mess of a film. please please, no more director's cuts or added footage...and by the way, i am a fan of most of the actors in this movie. what happened? but i stand by my statement about bucephalous. this animal didn't over-act, had a legitimate accent, and stood his ground with that poor elephant, who also gets a nod of approval from me. as far as i can tell, these are two characters who had no choice about being in this movie.<br/><br/>*arguabley ""not bad"" aspects of Alexander: 1)the desert/battle scenes, aka THE MUMMY 2)the blood looked real 3)employed a LOT of costumers for those thousands of outfits 4)the men looked better than the women (except Eva green) 5)mass carcass scenes post-battle, aka GONE WITH THE WIND, but not nearly as good. 6)not bad historical narrative by sir Anthony. otherwise, ""huh""? 7)by all accounts, Alexander was a progressive and compassionate ruler, compared to his brutal times. much like Alfred the Great was ahead of his time in this aspect. 8)many ""boys will be boys"" scenes, aka BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, but not nearly in the same league..nor universe, come to think of it... 9)some great busts, murals, statues and other art scattered around in the back ground 10)a zebra!! 11)one can forgive the globally conscious and compassionate Jolie for just about anything...<br/><br/>you may want to give it a watch, if you can get past the first few minutes. i only gave it a one based on the economy-busting amount of money that Mr Stone had to work with...perhaps i should upgrade my rating to, 1.01."
"garlingmatthews","1","423","747","5 February 2005"," How is it possible to take one of history's most interesting figures and a huge budget and make possibly the world's worst movie, ever?
","I was saddened when Alexander the movie received criticism for featuring homosexuality. Besides being a neanderthalic prejudice, it distracted from the many valid reasons for criticism. This is a strong contender for worst movie ever made.<br/><br/>I will say first that this film has a marvelous cast. But it really doesn't help. Really.<br/><br/>It's almost totally ahistorical, but that's standard practice. It's irritating if you know something about Alexander's life and deeds (I studied him college), but the people I feel sorry for are the ones who walk away thinking they've been exposed to an educational experience. There is a small book in explaining how wrong this assumption is. It'd write it, but it would involve watching the movie again. But the rather liberal interpretation of the available information is a side issue in explaining why this is a strong contender for worst movie ever made.<br/><br/>The script is dreadful. Mind-bendingly dreadful. It's deficiencies take several forms. I shall enumerate them;<br/><br/>1) The dialogue is actually a series of monologues. Every-one is apparently reciting excerpts from their autobiographies, or treatises on whatever is at hand, letters to whomever they are talking to, letters to the editor, political speeches, self-help manuals... It's certainly not conversation.<br/><br/>2) It's portentous. I sometimes like portentousness, it can lend atmosphere. Here, it lends to the tedium. The tedium doesn't need adding to, it's already oversubscribed.<br/><br/>3) It never knows when to stop. Anthony Hopkins has a monologue at the end that goes on for several minutes. You keep thinking it'll end, hoping, praying it will end (this Anthony Hopkins! He could probably read the ingredients of soap and make it sound interesting), and it does, eventually, but by then you slipped even further into a coma and are in no fit condition to cheer. Colin Farrell seems to spend half the movie looking off into space and holding forth at length on, oh, whatever, but always passionately.<br/><br/>4) It's badly written. It's a bad series of portentous monologues that never know when to stop.<br/><br/>Aside from the script (perhaps) the film features other flaws that inhibit it from greatness. Such as?<br/><br/>Pointless time jumps. I have nothing against time jumps. Highlander, Once upon a time in America, Godfather part two, Once upon a time in the West, For a few dollars more, and probably other films that weren't by Sergio Leone... Many great films feature them. But usually they follow a rationale. Usually they aren't apparently random and unconnected. Here, it's like they put a couple of reels in the wrong order.<br/><br/>Sins of omission. While I said that the lack of adherence to historical accuracy was a side issue, not mentioning almost any episode that might actually have been exciting or interesting seems a dubious policy. Alexander, as the posters implied, was the stuff of legend made real. (I make no moral judgement here). Does it mention the phalanx? Any the innovative ways that he overcame apparently unassailable fortresses by looking at the problems from another angle? The political methodology whereby he kept a grip on all of the peoples behind him? The Gordian Knot? Does it hell. It does feature a couple of battle scenes, the second of which is shot in a vivid and pretty colour scheme, and both of which illustrate that he fought at forefront of his army. So that's something.<br/><br/>The most laughable sex scene ever committed to film. Alexander wins over his bride by making kitty-cat claws gestures and noises. There's more, but that's definitely the stand-out feature.<br/><br/>I could go on, but this film has already eaten enough of my life. The only thing epic here is the ineptitude. It actually made me feel nauseous."

","After reading the comments on here, I have to say that I am stunned that anybody liked this film at all. I don't lightly say that I rank this as the worst non-B grade movie I've ever seen--ever. To begin with, all of the ""Greeks"" in this movie have Irish accents. Well, most of them, that is. Inexplicably, Angelina Jolie has a middle-eastern-meets-Russian kind of accent, and some have no accent at all. This hodge-podge of ridiculously out of place accents was so distracting that it was hard to stay focused on the movie. I laughed out loud when one of the soldiers actually said ""aye"" when confronting Alexander--I almost expected him to follow up by asking for ""me Lucky Charms"". I kept wondering how it was even possible that nobody in the production chain ever caught this absurdity and put a stop to it.<br/><br/>Beyond that glaring issue, the movie was bombastic and melodramatic to the extreme, it was too long, and the battle scenes were incomprehensible. I almost turned it off about 10 times, but I kept thinking there was no way it could get any worse. It did. Horrible. Oh, and did I mention the accents?"

","You'd have thought given the amount of ancient source material which is still extant, dodgy or not, on Alexander's life that Stone could have cobbled together a story from the various accounts without resorting to simply making bits up (i.e Alexander being shot in battle with Porus), pointlessly attributing speeches from one character to another (i.e Darius's daughter giving a reply to Alexander which is actually that of Porus), having set designs which were simply ludicrous (i.e Olympias having the Ram on a tree thingy from Ur in her room)...I could go on, and on, and on...This film was simply awful on every level, the battle of Gaugamela just looked like a complete shambles, why did the Macedonians (Including non-Irish actors) put on Irish accents? A misguided attempt to mask the misguided casting of Farrell? Who was himself hammier than a pig farm but given that the script often stank more than the latter I loathe to blame him entirely.<br/><br/>Avoid this film at all cost, especially if you have any education in the Classics, it's not even worth putting yourself through it for a laugh.<br/><br/>Oh yeah and it was the 'directors cut' I just watched, have never seen the original release and if this was an improvement God help those of you poor souls who saw it at the cinema."

","I'm giving this film one star for the reason that it has absolutely no excuse whatsoever for its wretchedness. With a cast like it has, a budget ample enough for three good films, and a legend-centered plot sure to pique the viewer's interest well before the movie is even seen, it delivers a seriously despicable, laughable fiasco.<br/><br/>Of course it's set in ancient Greece. What's interesting is that Alexander sounds straight out of Dublin. And his mother? Why, it's Angelina Jolie, and she's...straight out of Prince Vlad of Tepes' castle in Transylvania. That's right, Vlad of the Dracul. I suppose miss Jolie spent some time watching Gary Oldman deliver his line, ""Leesten to Dem! Di tcheeldren ov da nyyaat; vhat sveet muzik dai mike..."" or ""Alexander, Oi know vat veemen vi-ll do in yore loif..."" Yes, it is that bad. So far no good.<br/><br/>As for Alexander's supposedly legendary tactical genius and indomitable character, here instead the viewer gets to watch the boy from Dublin with painfully obvious bleached streaks in his hair and freshly tinted eyebrows look at Jared Leto countless times with a facial expression that's half ""Mommy can I have another cookie?"" and half irritable bowel syndrome. Leto reciprocates, and captivates movie-goers with a luxurious dark mane of Paul Mitchell's finest work and eyes that make Dakota Fanning look Chinese.<br/><br/>Kilmer is wasted here, as is Hopkins. I didn't give a damn about either of their characters. Watch it yourself to see if you do.<br/><br/>As a boy I was fascinated by Greek mythology, Greek Tragedy and Comedy. I jump at any chance I can get to tack on extra elements of wonder to my understanding of these subjects. At least I learned something new by watching Alexander. His mother was a vampire wanna-be snake temptress and Alexander's horse had more charisma than he did. Yup, Alexander's horse gets my nomination for best actor. <br/><br/>JD"
"azathoth-9","1","29","43","11 October 2005"," Terrible on every level.
","OK, first off Plutarch admits that in his account of the life of Alexander he was writing to teach a lesson (about 'civilised' moderation) rather than giving a 'true' historical account and therefore intentionally cherry picks scenes from different contradictory sources (a la Rumsfeld) to suit his point. Hollywood or Neocons manipulating history is nothing new, the ancient Greeks did it themselves. Stone uses Plutarch's theme throughout his film, don't be fooled by his placing the tale in the mouth of Ptolemy, Ptolemy was used as his main source by Arrian who wrote an altogether more honest and accurate account of Alexander's life and comes to quite different conclusions than Plutarch which while still dubious in their own right are demonstrably more trustworthy than a self-admitted propagandist.<br/><br/>So why use Plutarch when you know he's intentionally historically misleading? Because it's more sexy.<br/><br/>From him comes the portrayal of Olympias as having snakes in her bed (though not mucking about with them all the time), from him come the most lurid accounts of Alexander's excesses in sexuality, drinking, demagoguery and what have you...they have to be there so Plutarch can ultimately use them to kill him, it's Plutarch who puts Alexander's death down to drinking, a tendentious lesson in how ignoring the Greek virtue of self control will bring even the 'Great' to a sticky end.<br/><br/>Here endeth the history lesson.<br/><br/>As to the film itself my complaints would largely be repeating what's already been said...very silly and inappropriate accents, the structure of the film is a mess, manipulative historical inaccuracies which would have made even Plutarch blush, are they Greek or Macedonian? Misrepresentation of the Achaemenid Persians while completely ignoring Alexander's massacres of civilians, terrible and confusing battles which give no hint at his tactical brilliance (looking mad/daft and shouting a lot does not a great commander make), he gets an arrow in the chest at completely the wrong time and place, awful hammy script making for unintentional comedic moments.....and much, much more.<br/><br/>...takes a breath...<br/><br/>So in conclusion, this film is largely based on the least trustworthy account of Alexander's life which is then messed about with a bit more by Stone, often for no discernibly good reason, then chopped up into a pointlessly confusing, often laughable shambles.<br/><br/>Avoid."
"gftbiloxi","1","42","65","7 August 2005"," An Epic Hubris
","Viewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's Alexander, which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time. The film is not about conquest; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most self-contradictory and enigmatic figures.<br/><br/>The emphasis, however, should be on the word ""attempt."" Alexander fails in three basic ways: in its cast, in its refusal to meet certain character issues head-on, and in a directorial decision that easily ranks among the most serious misfires in recent memory.<br/><br/>Alexander the Great was a charismatic, self-contradictory, and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the largest army the world had seen up to that point. He was a battle-tested killing machine by age sixteen, King of Macedonia by twenty, conqueror of the known world by thirtyand above all one of the great military geniuses of his or any other age. Colin Farrell plays the character as a weak-minded, emotionally distraught entity, going through the entire film with a series of facial expressions that would lead to believe he is desperate need of a dose of salts. It is completely impossible to accept him in the role.<br/><br/>Although Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performances as King Philip and Queen Olympias, the remaining performances are equally impossible. Jared Leto's Hephaistion looks for all the world like a Malibu hooker afflicted by an eyeliner addiction; it is impossible to perceive him as Alexander's military whip. Franciso Bosch's Bagoas could be an ancient-world version of Cher after a particularly thick night, albeit with better cleavage. As for Queen Roxane, history notes that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that Alexander found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father. The role, however, is considerably revised, and while Rosario Dawson gives it all she has the part plays like something out of bondage skin flick.<br/><br/>During the film's theatrical release some audiences complained that Alexander was portrayed as a homosexual. Unfortunately, you cannot offer a psychological portrait of Alexander without indicating his general indifference to women and putting him in bed with at least two men: the general Hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave Bagoas. That is who Alexander was; that was what the ancient world was like. But instead of meeting this issue head-on, the film attempts to ""indicate"" the relationships through a series of longing gazes, the occasional caress, and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen. The resulting relationships read like something off a television soap opera that has been canceled halfway into the first season.<br/><br/>For the sexually insecure, there is a DVD issue that deletes some eight minutes of this footage; although I went with the unedited version, and although the scenes in question are very badly done, I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringe-inducing scenes improves the film to any significant degreelargely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward.<br/><br/>The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that Anthony Hopkins is required to provide constant narrationsomething that has the effect of telling us what happened rather than allowing us to see it happen. But by far the greatest failing of the script and story line is Oliver Stone's decision to present a chunk of the story, such as it is, out of sequence.<br/><br/>In essence, the first half hour of the film establishes the tri-fold conflict between King Philip, Queen Olympias, and the young Alexander and runs up to a major confrontation. At this point the film suddenly jumps eight years ahead to the invasion of Persia, and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous, unexpected, and disastrous flaw in the film. Approximately two hours later the film presents this ""lost time"" in the form of a flashbackbut by this point of the scenes have been lost and we've all figured out the details anyway. Oliver Stone is a master of creating parallel story lines and time lines. One need look no further than JFK to see his skill. It is astonishing, utterly astonishing, that he could do no better than this and, not being able to do better, did not find a better way entirely.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, Alexander is presented as an out-of-control weakling, his psychological motivations are hilariously pat at best, and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force, much less lead it to a single victory, much less conquer the known world. Clearly Stone was attempting to reach a new height in epic cinema, but the Greeks had a word for ill-advised ambition founded on a god-like arrogance: hubris. It was a sin they believed was never left unpunished, and in this instance the punishment is a career-crippling, if not entirely career-killing, film.<br/><br/>As noted, there are several DVD versions, including a director's cut that removes approximately fifteen minutes, eight of them dealing with Alexander's sexuality. Bonuses include documentaries on the making of the film and on composer Vangelis, who scored it, as well as an amazingly beside-the-point commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox.<br/><br/>Gary F.

","Alexander is essentially about this Russian sounding babe (played by Ms. Jolie) who marries into this big Oirish family, is driven to preferring snakes because her husband only has one eye, and begins dying her little boy's hair blonde. Then it all kicks off, Colin Farrell gets his eyebrows bleached and goes off in a flouncy tantrum to conquer the world. Meanwhile Jared Leto stands around with a twisty Cher hairdo, gazing longingly at bottle-blondie Colin, who every now and then gazes back with tears in his eyes and whispers 'Oy cahnt live if livin' is without you...' So anyway, about half way through that really handsome guy from The Book Group (the one in the wheelchair) and those porridge commercials shows up, but he has a different hairdresser... he stands around a lot, proving that sensible haircuts WERE possible in ancient times. I think he loses his razor at one point, but finds it again eventually... later Tim Piggott-Smith has to smush his hands around inside a dead animal, but they cut all his lines, so of course it all makes PERFECT sense.<br/><br/>Then the elephants come..."

","OK, let's stop beating around the bush. This is just a dog. The worst is undoubtedly the dialogue - unspeakable lines full of kitsch and pomposity in a style that Hollywood thankfully left behind somewhere in the 1940's. The other thing that sinks the movie is the pacing that is totally off. Every time the momentum picks up a little and we finally get into it a bit, we are suddenly thrown back into yet another agonizing scene between Alexander and his mother, or his father, that stops the film dead in its tracks because of the ridiculous dialogue and over-the-top acting.<br/><br/>Not to mention the weird accents, Colin Farrell who is wholly miscast because he doesn't have the charisma of a world-class leader (nor the voice - in his pre-battle pep talk speeches he squeaks like a mouse on speed), the wishy-washy approach to his bisexuality (if you want to make the point, then just make it, for Pete's sake), the flat characters of his friends and generals that one cannot tell apart, Val Kilmer chewing up the scenery, and the rather poor aerial shots of the big battle. A waste of time."
"jz-10","4","14","19","30 April 2006"," The Problem with Alexander
","The historical epic is trying to make a comeback, and failing horribly. Just as Emmerich failed with the enduring legend of Achilles and the Trojan war, Stone fails miserably with Alexander.<br/><br/>In the 60s, in the era of Spartacus and Lawrence of Arabia, audiences knew what they wanted and expected from a historical film--good history, a sympathetic hero (and hopefully heroine), lots of action. In many ways, our expectations have become much more sophisticated. We want convincing costumes and sets, special effects that make the action absolutely believable, and acting and dialog that allows us to get inside the characters' heads.<br/><br/>I submit that Alexander and Troy bombed because the directors threw buckets of effects and money onto stories that they didn't understand themselves--they used overwhelmingly broad strokes and declamatory speeches when nuances and realism would do much more.<br/><br/>We never understand the title character in Alexander. He's driven to conquer the world, but why? What's going on inside his head? Millions of dollars were spent on battle scenes, but almost nothing on a realistic portrayal of the man, his family, or friends. Olympia and Bagoas are not remotely believable in their femme fatale roles. Olympia, in particular, is nothing more than a caricature--she is never seen without at least one snake being present--is that subtle or what? <br/><br/>Stone obviously doesn't understand Alexander, and so portrays him as an enigma. But as an enigma film, it fails as well! Rent ""Donnie Darko"" or ""Mulholland Drive"" instead"
"cliveowensucks","8","663","1229","30 November 2004"," Alexander proves too smart for dumb American critics
","The US reviews have been really terrible and the IMDb user rating is lower than KING ARTHUR, so I'm wondering if Europe has got a different cut, because the film I saw was excellent. Problems, yes, like Anthony Hopkins and Val Kilmer hamming away and Angeline doing a very odd accent. Farrell's not bad even though he doesn't have enough small moments to work with to shade the role: after Clive Owen's disgracefully bad performance in KING ARTHUR it's amazing that it's Farrell the critics are laughing at.<br/><br/>You don't get involved in the characters as much as you should, but its an amazing flick, a real movie. It feels like it's been done for real not by a computer by someone as mad and vainglorious as Alexander himself. Not a total success, but the 80% that hits the target is really intelligent and ambitious and is worth more than a lot of pictures that work better, if you know what I mean. <br/><br/>I think the reason Hollywood is so dumbed down now is when someone tries to do something different on a big scale like Alexander, HEAVEN'S GATE, REDS, ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, THE RIGHT STUFF or films like that is that the American critics who are always complaining about dumb audiences and filmmakers can't get them and tear them a new *beep*hole killing them off at the box-office. Certainly seems to be the case with Alexander. Not the most successful flick I've seen this year but easily one of the best."

","It took me two nights (2½ hours total) to watch this - as I couldn't stay awake the first night. The story of Alexander is fascinating, but you wouldn't know it from watching this movie. (Michael Wood's excellent TV series/DVD/book ""In the Footsteps of Alexander The Great"" is a much better use of your time, and much more engaging.) <br/><br/>The Irish accents are invasive, and in the case of some (e.g. Val Kilmer) truly risible. (And the Russian accents? Come on!) Colin Farrell is utterly implausible - I wouldn't follow him to the bottom of my garden, and that's not very far. My wife thinks he looked like a porn star. (It would have been a very low budget porn film to use such poor wigs...)<br/><br/>The film's historical accuracy is better than Stone's version of the Kennedy story, but it completely misses in its attempt to capture the true sense of scale and ambition in Alexander's quests. It similarly fails to adequately address the source of that ambition.<br/><br/>In summary, this film utilises the talents of a dozen or so stars (and Colin Farrell), millions of dollars of very obvious production costs and is based on one of the most epic stories of individual ambition in the history of the world.

","As Anthony Hopkins in a very prophetic bit of writing tells us ""His failures tower over others successes"" I believe that's also true for Oliver Stone you may like him, or not, agree or disagree with him but you can never dismiss him. He goes for it, he takes amazing chances. Naturally, the risks are enormous. Alexander is a misfire from almost every angle. Maybe the most important aspect that in Colin Farrell's portrayal there isn't a hint of greatness. If this was really Alexander he wouldn't have made it into the history books as ""The Great"" but as ""The Queen who wanted to be King"". With this I'm not attacking the gay portrayal. That was a fact, present in every serious biography of the man. I remember the Robert Rossen version of the story, with a moody Richard Burton as Alexander and a great Danielle Darrieux as his mother. The problem there was quite different. We had hints of what made Alexander great but the film was a plodding, solemn, unexciting little epic. Maybe this is one of those subjects that mere mortals shouldn't attempt. Not even Oliver The Great."

","If there have been five films in my life that left the most indelible impression on me, holding me immobilized on my chair watching until the last credit has disappeared while everybody else is already leaving, talking to myself while going home, three of them were connected to Oliver Stone one way or another (Midnight Express being the first). Alexander is the latest one. Why Alexander is Great? Because it was made by a visionary about another visionary, because it is true to itself, to the legacy, to history, because it doesn't sell off, because it is not your typical popcorn blockbuster, and most of all because, steering away from creating a cartoon-like, hollow and fake ""Super-Man"" (Troy's Achilles) it focuses on the Man Alexander. The Hu-Man Alexander. Without concessions to what's popular, what's expected, what's commercial, what's understandable. This is a director that doesn't mince words or films. You can tell I am still under the spell. People mention the sexual orientation thing, either to complain about too much or too little. Don't judge the Ancient World by today's or yesterday's standards. Men in Ancient Greece had Friendships (albeit not necessarily platonic ones), not Relationships. People mention the accents. Alexander was born in Ancient Macedonia (not to be confused with today's Balcan state of the same name, please) and therefore would have spoken heavily-accented Greek, Olympias was born from Epirus, Roxanne could muster very little Greek since she was a ""barbarian"" (meaning non-Greek back then) and Alexander's soldiers came from all over Southern Balkan, Minor Asia etc. I found the choice of Irish over British or American (reserved to Athenians for instance) accent, and the use in the film of many different accents a particularly clever one. People dismiss the eagle's overflight. Read about omens from the gods, they were very important for the Ancients. People want full visibility during the battles (why don't you see a John Wayne film then, all the dead are hidden from view and the heroes are never afraid or confused), people want more battles or events (and yet complain about how long the film is), people want their money back. I could go on and on here but there is no use. See the film again. Read a book. Open your eyes. Ask questions. Undefeated yet mortal, great yet flawed, larger-than-life yet human, Alexander has left a mark in the histories of so many peoples for a reason, and yet, the film has no more chances to be understood by his viewers than the king himself from his soldiers and childhood friends. Typical and sad."

","I waited for the DVD and the amount of marketing to convince people it was good was overwhelming. I certainly had my expectations that Oliver Stone would finally produce a good movie but I was thoroughly disappointed. Oliver Stone continues to produce movies that are horrible. From the weird Irish accents, emphasis on Alexander's gay relationships to the failed attempt by Alexander (Farrell) to inspire his legions as William Wallace (Mel Gibson) did in Braveheart, this movie was a joke. I'm pretty tolerant of bad acting and directors trying to make big budget historical productions demonstrating some knowledge of the subject matter but this was literally 165 minutes of my life that I can't get back.

I didn't have a clue who was fighting who and who was loosing as the camera work during this scene was appalling. FAR too much movement found it difficult to focus on what was going on and who was dying.<br/><br/>Was indeed true to history, but a lot of the time I found myself thinking wtf is going on? Whos he?

This is not a film that is just, as one user put it, above the masses, it is just far too dull to get anywhere. It's not actually that historically accurate, it's not entertaining, but it IS the only film i've been to see at the cinema which i have been very tempted to walk out of!

The battle scene near the beginning of the movie was alright though. During the movie, it kept flashing back to the past (example: 10 years ago, 6 years ago, 2 years ago) throughout the movie. Alexander kept changing, one minute he is a hero, the next minute he is a cruel angry man. When I learned about Alexander the great in school, he actually seemed great. I kept feeling like i wanted something to happen in the movie that I actually would enjoy. Like I said before, it was long and hard to watch. And why did Alexander's mother have a strange accent?

"alexkolokotronis","1","37","59","22 April 2008"," I Don't Think Stone Truly Directed This
","It seems as if the whole movie was restricted on different levels. Some of it looked totally spontaneous and wild and sometimes it looked totally restricted.<br/><br/>The casting was horrendous here and I think it has nothing to do with Stone. Stone said his dream pick was Russell Crowe, so then why didn't he get him. Obviously the movie required a big budget so it can't have anything to do with money issues. This probably had to do with Warner Brothers Studios. Despite having a star cast the chemistry between the actors was horrible. Usually Stone does a better job of this. Angelina Jolie played the mother and she is a year younger than Farrell. This probably would not have been so big of a deal if the movie was better. Some of the most basic things were not accomplished in this movie and that probably has to do with in large part of wanting to make good money.<br/><br/>The directing if there was any was horrible together with the editing. Everything seemed to be all over the place. No effort seemed to come out of the directing or editing. The battle scenes were horrible not having the slightest idea of what is happening. The writing was OK but nothing special and probably once again restricted.<br/><br/>The acting was over the top. Colin Farrell just perfectly describes this. The role of Alexander was too big for him too handle. As previously mentioned before the fact that Farrell was picked for this is a disgrace. Everything in here seemed so over the top and cliché that it frustrated me. Especially with all these talented actors.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie at all. It is clearly influenced by money and sponsors and is a horrible movie to top it off. This was made to make money not be a good film and that just sums everything up here and that is just unlike Stone who didn't write it nor did he produce it. The worst of it though is that there is no point or message whatsoever and that is definitely not like Oliver Stone."
"perceptor","1","52","86","21 July 2005"," An Insult to the Man
","Some people speak of how this movie portrays Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion, and how many people dislike the focus on a homosexual relationship in the movie. Commonly, these comments include an assessment that the values in Alexander's day were far different from the values of our day. This is true. The homosexual relationship that existed between Alexander and Hephaestion, however, would not have been the same as a homosexual relationship today. This is one of the movie's great failings. Alexander and Hephaestion are portrayed in a manner more befitting characters on Will and Grace than as the warriors that they were. Apparently, for Oliver Stone, if someone has sex with a man that person will act like a girl.<br/><br/>The movie also fails in portraying a commander that could actually inspire soldiers. Alexander cries in front of his men. He begs them instead of commanding them. There is nothing in the character portrayed in the movie that would cause a man to follow him for years on end. The man who would cut the Gordian knot is nowhere to be found in this movie. I guess it's fortunate that that story isn't in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie also suffers in an area that could have made it at least mildly entertaining. The huge battle scenes utilize a ""shaky camera"" method to make things seem violent and exciting. The result is that it is next to impossible to make out what exactly is going on in the battles. They also serve to further display Alexander's apparent impotence. No brilliant tactical maneuvers are shown. Alexander also lacks the ability to actually hit an opponent with a thrown weapon. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie, Ptolemy reflects on Alexander's greatness. I couldn't find anything great about Alexander. This is quite perturbing for me. Alexander the Great is my favorite historical figure. I was thrilled to find out that a movie about his life was being made. Imagine my disappointment to find nothing of that person in the movie. Oh. Wait. Yeah. He had sex with men. When that became the most important part of his story... I don't know."

","First of all, if anyone says this movie is historically accurate, please go back and read the surviving texts of Alexander's life. It is horribly inaccurate, which is bad enough, but to be completely expected for a movie based on any historical subject.<br/><br/>In terms of film-making, it rates as low as historical accuracy. The acting is completely hammed up, I don't understand how Colin Farrell continues to get leading roles, he is a horrible actor. The sheer amounts of accents all over the place is annoying and distracting. Phillip and Alexander sound Irish, you have Scottish accents, and then you have Olympia, played by Angelina Jolie, who's insane accent I can't even place. The only real good acting came from Christopher Plummer and Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>In terms of direction, the overuse of the eagle flying in and out of the sun became to distracting and was so glaringly obvious. Oliver Stone appears to exert no effort in making a good film. I remember hearing how he blamed the ""sexuality"" of his film for bad reviews, no I think it's the bad acting, the horrible writing, and the pointless direction."

","There is a scene between Alexander and his wife Roxanne in which Alexander violently rips off Roxanne's clothes against her will, she responds by putting a knife to his throat and things are only resolved when Alexander speaks some gentler words and they end up making passionate love.<br/><br/>This, no doubt, is director Oliver Stone's (and his writers) view of Western involvement in the middle East from Alexander through the Crusades to Bush and their hopes for the future. The metaphor (simplistic and unhistorical as it is) may have worked, too had this whole scene not been shot as soft porn which tends to undermine its message.<br/><br/>Much the same could be said of the whole film, an oddly constructed and badly written farrago of ideas, mostly non-historical. A lot has been made of the homoeroticism but that is somewhat more accurate than many other aspects of the film. Alexander is portrayed as the world's first multiculturalist, something which would surprise Arabs who still invoke his name to frighten children even to this day. Stone and his writers are more interested in Alex spouting platitudes about respecting the Persians ancient culture rather than his belief in the superiority of Greece over the barbarians.<br/><br/>Alexander's wife Roxanne, when she is not required to do full frontals, contributes very little to the film apart from a few pouty looks. Since the story is light on females, Alex's mother, played by Angelina Jolie is drafted in, her contribution being to read a few letters written to Alex from Macedonia. It sounds unconvincing, and it is.<br/><br/>Jolie speaks in an odd Russian accent for some unexplained reason and the whole matter of accents in this film is a strange one. The Macedonians are all Irish and the Greeks English. This is surprising but not the worst sin in this film.<br/><br/>The main narrative thread is given to Anthony Hopkins to read in a an unconvincing voice over. This seems more designed to paper over awkward historical facts than to be organically part of the film. The whole thing seems choppily edited and directed with a mishmash of devices used to no artistic purpose. For example: at one point late on, up to that time completely linear (apart from Hopkins narrative), lurches back 8 years to see the murder of Alex's father. After this lengthy interpolation, which would have been better integrated earlier in the film, we lunge back to 'the present' where the remainder continues in linear fashion. A small point, but one among very many which leaves you to ask why the director has made the decisions he has.<br/><br/>Despite all these devices the film is still inordinately long and slow rather like the constant snake imagery used through out (and which is clearly meant to be a metaphor for something. but what?)<br/><br/>It is not surprising, given such a duff script, that the actors are reduced to giving a lot of meaningful looks reminiscent of daytime soap-operas. <br/><br/>Bad."

Nothing else no matter how bad, can register on the Alexander scale. They are blip absorbed by the massive absurdity of this movie.<br/><br/>Writing this comment is hard. I'm lost to where to start. Okay, lets start with the accents. Even after the 10 or so hours, days even, this movie went for the Irish accents still stood out like dogs balls. It hurt my brain to hear some orange headed Scotsman plead to go back to family in Greece. Yes he said ""arsh"" I think he meant arse.<br/><br/>Hooboy I just remembered TAX SYSTEM! Firstly, I never knew the Greeks used their characters but spelt in language that didn't yet exist as the inhabitants of England were busy picking fleas off each other. The way it spelt would sound out ""tah sgstim"". Oh how about Cyprus? In the initial scene of the mosaic map Cyprus is spelt with Greek characters and two minutes later when it shown again its in English characters. You'd think $215 MILLION dollars would actually pay for someone to look for mistakes.<br/><br/>I doubt anyone watched this movie before it was released. If they did they should be shot, along with Oliver Stone and the rest of the cast. I hope the never work again. Why the hell couldn't they hire any Greek actors? I reckon the went down to Bridie O'Reily's picked a bunch of Guiness drinking hoons to cast for this film.<br/><br/>Staring is a good way to waste hours in film according to Stone. Alexander spends more time staring at Leto and the Sun than doing anything else. After staring at Leto he cries. A lot. After staring at the sun he gives a contrived monologue. In fact this movie is a whole bunch of monologues and crying scenes smashed together in random order.<br/><br/>And then we come to the battle scenes. Oh my God. I thought Alexander was the greatest military genius in the history of man. Not, bloke who rode blindly into enemy soldiers, while his army was half a kilometre behind him, then sat around on his horse staring off into the distance while the enemy stood around not killing him. The battle scenes made no sense, were difficult to follow and involved a lot of images of bloodied feet. What happened to famous Greek phalanx? It was more like the Persians vs. the Persians. Or even better a bloody football hooligan mêlée. All they needed were flares and darts, it would fit in with Irish, English and Scottish accents. Seeing as we're back on accents, Angelina Jolie's accent was something I'd expect to hear on 'Allo'Allo. She was nearly Russian, in fact here accent was more convincing than Sean Connery's in ""The Hunt for Red October"". At least Sean Connery can act.<br/><br/>Why was this movie so long? I thought the movie was nearly over when they took Babylon, what a mistake. It was like waking up on Monday and thinking it was Sunday. Alexander didn't age at all, his hair just got longer. I wish I could say the same for myself. By the end of the film, I needed to buy incontinence underpants and cash in my superannuation.<br/><br/>And why did we need to see a fat one eyed Val Kilmer sodomising a young boy? If I wanted to see that, I would have gone to the local Scout hall. It was simply unnecessary, like most scenes in this movie it seems like it was added at random.<br/><br/>""I'm trying to unite the people of Asia and Europe"" what a load of spunk. Alexander was a conquerer and old-school ancient times conquerer, who conquered for the sake of conquering.<br/><br/>I could go on for ever about this movie but reliving the experience is becoming too painful.

","The critic and film historian Robert Sarris said of Robert Rossen's 1956 epic 'Alexander the Great', featuring Richard Burton as our titular hero, that it ""aimed for greatness and lost honourably"". Oliver Stone's current offering to the Dionysian gods of cinematic excess, 'Alexander', has much in common with it's predecessor but, sadly, honour isn't one of them.<br/><br/>Like the earlier film and, for that matter, every film Stone has ever made, it's  at knocking on three hours  seriously in need of a good editor. It has an all-star cast, mostly drawn - in the great Hollywood tradition of the Classical world being populated by British character actors  from current Equity rosters (the likes of Olivier, Barry Jones and Michael Hordern are replaced by rather more low-rent personages as Tim Piggot-Smith, Brian Blessed and that big fella from the Scots Porridge Oats advert). Also, like the original movie it features a dark and hairy Celtic-type who can't do accents as the blond, blue-eyed Hellenic hero. With Burton  a man with natural presence and authority  this latter incongruity is more easily overlooked than is the case with Colin Farrell, who has the general demeanour of a bleached and strategically shaved Gremlin. Hairy Col's verbal limitations have also, it seems, led Stone to populate Macedonia with Irishmen  with a token Welshman and Scotsman thrown in for good measure (Greeks are all Englishmen, by the way). This means that Val Kilmer, as Alexander's dear old dad, Philip, has to adopt a brogue almost as astonishingly unconvincing as his wig, and that unintentional titters abound in the auditoria as hairy Hibernian's slap each other manfully on the back proclaiming such classic lines as ""In t' name o' Zeus, Alexander, d'ye t'ink I'm a daft auld sod?"" Foreigners are granted a variety of curious accents. Angelina Jolie sounds Russian and Athena alone knows where in Hades Rosario Dawson is supposed to come from.<br/><br/>This coming from Laughin' Ollie Stone it's a poker-faced presentation, offering conspiracies a-plenty. I wouldn't have been surprised if there had been talk of a Lone Swordsman on a grassy Grecian knoll when Philip was offed. The main difference between this film and the 1956 offering comes in its treatment of Alexander's homosexuality. Nary a mention was made of Big Gay Al's rather more than Platonic relationships in Rossen's film. Here, it's evident, but is the object of knowing disdainful frowns from his contemporaries  which shows a pitiful understanding, on the part of Stone, of Hellenic sexual politics. Here it's clearly presented as a character flaw, showing nothing more clearly than the director's cowardice in addressing the issue: in a film notable for it's visceral excess, and which requires nudity from Rosario Dawson in a near-rape scene, Stone limit's Alexander's 'unnatural' appetites to precisely three hugs and two pecks on the lips. <br/><br/>The film is a muddled hotch-potch of incidents from Alexander's life. This would be less of a muddle, admittedly, if a fifteen minute flashback two-thirds of the way through the film was presented as part of the otherwise straightforward linear narrative. There are a few parallels between the life-choices and characters of Alexander and Philip, but these appear almost to have been afterthoughts. The greatest impediments, though, are that - despite it's great length - characters are not permitted to evolve beyond one-note caricatures (though Kilmer, an actor I have little time for, normally, tries harder than most with what little screen time he has), and that Farrell has no authority whatever on screen. <br/><br/>Thus, sorry though I am to have to say it, I am forced to confirm the critical evaluation of 'Alexander' offered by the Chavs whose departure from the cinema preceded my own. One succinctly noted ""That was rotten."" ""Aye,"" said the other, referring to the pulchritudinous Ms Dawson, ""But that coloured bird is kinda fit!"" Indeed she is, boys. Indeed she is."

","I feel i must make people aware that there are many of us who have seen this film and don't care if Alexander liked boys or girls yet still think this motion picture is absolutely, terrifyingly, obtusely and almost intentionally awful in every way it could be. Some may love the issues it touches on but be warned, you may just find yourself spending far more time than you would ever wish trying to tell everyone you know just how absolutely terrible you thought it was. The actors, although mostly multi-million dollar ""heroes of Hollywood"" are made to look like children in a bad school play by a uniquely hollow script. Even the apparent ""historical accuracy"" which Oliver Stone so readily tells us of is poorly executed and occasionally misleading. The Persian army are not a collection of brain-dead simpletons running randomly around the field of battle like they're being told to go in two directions at once (i mean, really Oliver, wtf was that opening shot of them all about?) To further add to the humour value Colin Farrell's pre-battle chat to his ""generals"" (mostly a collection of model-turned-actor brainless pouters) is filled with a marvellous moment when Mr.Farrel lists off every single Greek name of every general in the room and a summary of what they're good at in battle. The scene is so leaden you wonder if Farrell found a copy of Stone's notes on who was supposed to be in the shot and just read them out. It was like bullet-point history with no character or life. Every second moment in this film heightens it's own tension to the Nth degree as if to cry out to the audience watching ""BUT LOOK, CAN YOU NOT SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?!?"" I hardly think Stone's assumption that his ""film"" (i think ""moooveee"" is more accurate) plays well with ""intelligent audiences"" is anywhere near the truth. I don't know, maybe his Mom likes it. If you like historical epics don't watch this.<br/><br/>To summarise: Alexander - it steals time out of your life even when you're not watching it."
"andros12","8","222","411","11 December 2004"," I believe this beautiful, exotic film will become a collectible much like ""Satyricon.""
","This film presents an intense psychological investigation of the character of Alexander of Macedon. It is thoroughly immersed in the moral, political and philosophical climate of Grecian antiquity, In many ways it bears somewhat of a resemblance to Fellini's ""Satyricon"" of thirty-five years earlier. There is the similar re-appearance of the Cyclops-like characters, the shrew-like ""luna"" characters with their sensual but corresponding dark sides, a ""token"" love garden, the tinted filter/lens effect on specific scenes and the stunning ""pagan"" beauty evident in the set design. It also features male leads who share a code of honour and love between them. A love which in its ""highest"" spiritual form was representative as a means of transcendent personal growth and valor; ideas passed down from Plato to Aristotle. Chronological occurrences of Alexander's campaigns and political successes take a back seat as a result, disappointing many more intent on an all-inclusive rendering from this perspective. The variety of spoken accents form a type of ""primordial soup"" much like Fellini used in ""Satyricon"" as well; a curiosity thought by some to be symbolic of Jung and his theories of a ""collective unconscious"" wherein all language is simply an outward babbling to personify the universally shared life experience of all people. There were some cosmetic concerns, most notably Alexander's badly tinted hair and eyebrows. The excessive black eyeliner worn by Hephaestion is a look that does appear periodically on vases and frescoes. However, underneath all of the controversy lies the character of a deeply passionate man with his seemingly many strengths and weaknesses, attempting to grow and to love without limitation in accordance with his own perspective and level of understanding. Kudos to Colin for possessing the maturity and depth to present Alexander's complex personality and feelings with so much intensity and dignity."

","I met Oliver Stone while sitting at one of my regular coffee haunts in southern California, when he asked about what I was reading. I said it was my favorite biography on Alexander and that it was for the the 6th or 7th time, that it was the only one I know of written by a woman, and it was by far the best one. I told him I had read 5 including 2 from the ancient sources, and I do not read biographies. That Alexander had been my only exception. While we were talking, it seemed that he looked vaguely familiar, but I didn't know who he was until hearing months later that someone was making a movie about Alexander. <br/><br/>When I found out that it was Oliver Stone doing the picture, I just shook my head and smiled. We had been the only 2 people on the small patio of this downtown coffee house. Years later when I discovered he had donated 100k to the foundation (?) of this long dead Oxford graduate lesbian who lived in South Africa, whose writing seems to be generally disliked by classicists and scholars everywhere - I was certain it was him. At one point while asking me about the book, I told him no one had the balls to make a movie about Alexander. Not a real one. He must have taken it as a challenge. But then if you know his movies, someone like him would.<br/><br/>I don't have time to go into all the error, misunderstanding and lack of well known and widely available historical knowledge by so many, of the same sex relations during the entire span of ancient Greek might. From Homer to the Spartan hegemony to 5th century Athens to the Empire of Alexander, almost everybody did it, they were all married - and nobody was gay. Such terms, the idea and attitude they convey, as well as modern societal norms did not exist in that society or at that time. It is a historical non sequitur to apply what we know and how we live to what they knew and how they lived. And that's coming from a Preacher, who believes every word of the Bible. I just happen to like Alexander, and have studied him for almost 20 years now.<br/><br/>This film is highly accurate and well worth watching. But if you're not interested in Alexander - you won't be in the film. It's about one of the most influential men in history, but it is about a man. It's a great war flick also, but the action is incidental to the man. Not the other way around. With the exception of one movie with Richard Burton from at least 50 years ago, there are no other films about Alexander. It has a great cast with all giving strong performances, and Colin Farrell was perfect as Alexander.<br/><br/>We're talking about a guy who named one town after his horse and another after his dog. Who gave lavishly to everybody, inspired lifelong loyalty and rewarded it. Who knew thousands of his men by their first names and had personally saved many of their lives as well as payed off many of their debts - with his own money. He restored many conquered rulers to their former place (under him of course), and tolerated to live many who he knew hated him and wanted him dead - both in Athens and in his own camp - when he could have easily had them killed and nobody would have said anything, but he did not. Arrian says of Alexander that unlike other Kings, he repented when he knew he had done wrong. Knowing all that will help you know the man a little, and I think help you enjoy the film more.<br/><br/>I have read a fair amount by men who seemed to me jealous of him, and others who made the aforementioned non sequitur of judging him by the standards of their day instead of those of his own. It's also worth remembering that one of his boyhood friends and most trusted generals, Ptolemy, was the man responsible for the Hebrew Bible being translated into Greek - giving us the Septuagint. His son ( Ptolemy Philadelphus) finished the project. Giving us the very foundation for the Bible we have today.<br/><br/>When Alexander became King of Macedon at a little past 20 years old, all that he had inherited from his father were a few gold and silver cups, less than 60 talents in the treasury and debts of 500 that he owed. Upon borrowing 800 more, he gave away everything he had to friends and loyal supporters, some would take nothing from him. The man who would become his second in command, Perdiccas, asked him""What are you keeping for yourself ?"" ""Hope,"" said Alexander, to which Perdiccas replied ""That I'll share.""<br/><br/>http://fullgrownministry.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/alexander/"

Not to mention, how in the heck did the casting director think that Angelina Jolie was perfect for Alexander's mother? Colin Ferrell, Colin Ferrell as Alexander?! Now I wanted to give this guy a chance, but seriously, Colin Ferrell?! Not to mention the strange film making, the constant story always twirling back into the question of Alexander's sexuality. I'm such a history buff, now if a movie isn't true to history, it does irritate me a little, but I just think, it's a movie, if it's entertaining, give it a break. Trust me, Alexander is just a bad movie and is an insult to one of the greatest warriors of our time.<br/><br/>Based on the story of Alexander the Great, we see him grow as a boy who isn't accepted by his father, is admired by his mother, and is slowly learning the power of being a king, being a strong warrior. His father is murdered leaving him the throne and going into battle to conquer lands, own whoever he wants, make decisions that will effect his country, having to figure out who are his true friends, questioning his sexuality, discovering the true difficulty of being a good king to his people.<br/><br/>I seriously had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film, I just couldn't believe how long it was, I don't mind long movies at all if they are worth your time and are very well put together but Alexander is just a mess. The film jumps time back and forth and gets you all confused. Not to mention, please, what the heck was with Angelina Jolie's accent?! Did she watch Bram Stroker's Dracula too much? Believe me, I love movies, I mean, I really love movies, I will always say if this movie is meant for a certain crowd, but trust me when I say that this just a plain bad movie, you'd expect better from Oliver Stone, but he went way over his head and really went overboard with Alexander.<br/><br/>1/10"

For starters, we have Alexander, with his golden hair and Irish accent that makes you wonder whether he's looking for the ends of earth or his lucky charms, whose tale is narrated by Anthony Hopkins in his Hannibal Lector voice. They lead us through a dizzying, poorly structured epic tale that wanders over what feels like six hours but apparently is just under three. Along the way we meet his psychotic parents played as cartoons by Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. (seriously, was Angelina Jolie supposed to be a vampire?)<br/><br/>He's also supported by his band of merry men, all wigged and eye-shadowed out. There's some particularly bad acting provided by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (shouting his way in an apparent audition for his role on the Tudors), but everyone basically spends a lot of time screaming at each other or making meaningless loud speeches.<br/><br/>There are a lot of pretty shots, some interesting dance and party scenes, and numerous really bad sex/romance scenes. In the meantime to fill the endless spaces in the movie we get to seen teen angst, sexual frustration, Rosario Dawson in more eye make-up than all her other movies combined, way too much of Colin Ferrel (who oddly does not look good in sheer fabric), several death scenes so overwrought you wonder if the actors were just giddy that the movie was finally over for them.<br/><br/>And the truest sign of any great film? The use of a red filter over battle scenes, together with overwrought music. I suppose I should just be glad Stone didn't rent Our Lady of Soundtrack Sorrow to wail over all the final scenes."

However, the screenplay is simply awful, showing a long and very confused story that looks like a soap-opera, with many stupid lines. The characters and situations are not well developed, and the viewer is frequently surprised with actions or reactions without any previous explanations. The fight scenes are ridiculously choreographed, being a bloody and messy collection of blurred short images. The camera uses close-up most of the times and countless number of cuts. Angelina Jolie speaks with a ridiculous accent and I do not know what the intention of such behavior is. The free exploitation of gays and homosexual situations shows clearly the intention of raising a polemic theme to get the spots of the media and call the attention of the public in general.

If you want to explore and enjoy the history of Alexander go to a library or even better go to Alexandria, don't waste 2hrs 40 mins of your life.

","Leave it to the success of one type of film to spawn a sub-sequent barrage of films done in the same style, telling similar stories, some fictional, some quasi historical. In 2000, Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR brought back the Greco-Roman epics back into the forefront by telling a story Shakespeare himself would have been proud of (although having studied him I believe he would have, had he been able to, pump up the atrocious dialog David Franzoni created). In sticking to a simple, straightforward tale of a man wronged by envy who resorts to becoming a gladiator to fight for justice a contemporary classic was made and Russell Crowe, today's most intense actor, won his first Oscar and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone, who has seen better times and better films, decided to up the ante and create his own version of a historical epic by focusing on none other than Alexander the Great, the young man who Did Great Things and died when he was a little over thirty. Would it that he hadn't. Everything in this film feels overdone. Colin Farrell overacts into insanity in trying to go for larger-than-life, Angelina Jolie continues to demonstrate that she's on media-fame only (although she tries to convince as Olympias), and everyone else goes through the motions, fulfilling parts that are on autopilot. This movie was so awful it took discipline for me to sit through; I might as well stayed with the History Channel's documentary on the same matter. At least they based their show on fact.<br/><br/>Who will this appeal to? The older crowd have had their share of Ben Hurs and I Claudiuses so they might not be interested. The Greeks boycotted it when it came out because they were outraged that Alex was a queer so that rules them out. That leaves the younger set, those who haven't done their homework in studying history, who would only go see it for the hype surrounding the brief moments of nudity -- namely Rosario Dawson's --, Colin Farrell's chiseled physique, and the references to homosexuality. Maybe not the worst film of 2004, but it did try hard to push the envelope. It's still not as terrible as CALIGULA, though: that is one tough cookie to crack."

","Oliver Stone is Oliver Stone. When you go to see one of his films you know you'll enter unknown territory. I though that was what movies were all about. A personal vision. Not documentaries or Sunday school classes. Richard Attenborough's ""Ghandi"" was that, and as a consequence Oscars, praises, oodles of cash. Ben Kingsley was superb but the title character is treated as if nobody had ever heard of ""Ghandi"" the same can be said of another Attenborough biopic: ""Chaplin"". No, Oliver Stone gives his audience a little bit more credit and, naturally, he is paying the consequences. I think the film is mind blowing. Arbitrary? Yes, beautifully so. Even the accents of the actors is one of the many strokes of genius. Within its historical context those characters spoke with different accents. They were in the ultimate melting pot. Colin Farrell bold portrayal, Irish accent and all is bound to leave its mark. Oliver Stone took every imaginable risk and I for one, applaud him with a loud Long Live the Cinema."

","People are blaming bad reviews for this film on 'dumb' audiences and film critics. Firstly, film critics do usually know their stuff when it comes to films. That's why they're employed as film critics. Secondly I'm one intelligent person who sat though this film and loathed it. Seated next to me was a friend of mine who is reading classics at Cambridge. She was bored out of her mind too.<br/><br/>I've read Ovid etc. I know the myths. I dint like this film not because I was too uneducated to comprehend it but because it was dull. It may have been historically accurate but that does not make it a good film. It was repetitive and pointless. Most of the audience in the screening we were in walked out way before the end. When you make a film, you should make a film. If making it a good film means leaving out the occasional bit of history then so be it.<br/><br/>This was like an extended lecture and I nearly fell asleep. It was not even saved by some admirable acting performances, particularly from some of the smaller roles. Jolie was on form but I'm afraid to say Farrel lacked the necessary charisma and energy for such a part as Alexander. Possibly a stronger actor would have improved matters but really, it was the long drawn out and flat screenplay which killed this one off. It was beautifully shot, but so are many other films. My advice is: don't go see Alexander just in an effort to prove yourself intelligent and sophisticated, avoid it like the plague."
"timknight295","2","13","19","5 February 2006"," Alexander review
","Don't listen to all the positive reviews of this film it is in fact tedious.<br/><br/>Alexander was this fantastic warrior so why don't we see him fight much? There are only two battle scenes in this film and the amount of time we see Alexander in action is minimal. He was bisexual/trisexual/pansexual as well so why don't we get more sex scenes? We don't get much sex or violence in this film we get lots of boring boring talking, and the characters talk like in a Shakespeare play so most of the time you can't work out what they're drivelling on about. If Stone really wanted to make the language authentic he should have got his characters to speak in the actual languages used at the time like in 'Passion of the Christ'.<br/><br/>I think Oliver Stone has made some excellent films like 'Born on the 4th of July' and 'Natural Born Killers' but he just got it wrong here. In attempting to make the film deep it just ends up deeply tedious. The film is very uninvolving and you don't get to care for the characters. They keep going on about Achilles and Troy in this film. 'Troy' is way better than this film because it doesn't shy away from being a straightforward piece of entertainment, and in actual fact it succeeds in being a lot more deep and meaningful that this confusing and pretentious film. Why does Stone decide to introduce his natural born killer red colouring effect when Alexander falls in battle? It really doesn't mean anything apart from- yeah- Alexander is injured so he's bleeding and blood is red so- yeah- everything goes red- yeah- like blood - yeah deep and meaningful.<br/><br/>Lots of talk and very little action of sexual or violent nature about a hypersexual hyperviolent warlord results in a very disappointing film and at 2 hours 40 minutes long a really boring one too."
"pyrocitor","3","13","19","14 November 2005"," Alexander the atrocious
","When director Oliver Stone announced that he would be making a huge budget film on the life of Alexander the Great, audiences, understandably, had high hopes. When the casting of Colin Farrell as Alexander was announced, these hopes were further stoked, by the fact that no huge name actor, such as Brad Pitt had been cast. Could it possibly be that Alexander might focus on talent, rather than the kind of big-budget mess that both Troy and King Arthur had turned out to be?<br/><br/>Sadly, the answer is a resounding no. The project turns out to be nothing less than a massive letdown in the end, with surprisingly huge failures in almost every section possible. There are so many places to pick apart at Alexander, it's hard to know where to start. So it may seem easiest to start with the man in charge of it all: Oliver Stone. <br/><br/>Stone has clearly stepped out of his element here - while used to dealing with political dramas based on the lives of past U.S. Presidents, he seems tied up with trying to make reference as much as possible to Greek mythology and tradition. As a result, Alexander comes off almost documentary style, with every character spewing pretentious , cheesy and mostly incomprehensible lines that seem straight out of a badly translated history textbook. How in god's name has Stone suddenly become such a terrible writer? Not to mention that any directorial influence seems totally absent, as the plot sways sickeningly between present and flashbacks in a confusing manner for no real purpose at all, except seemingly to confuse and disorient the viewer. The movie starts out far too slow, and with far too much talking, mostly just pointless glorifying of Alexander, and it doesn't improve much as it progresses through its painfully long runtime. <br/><br/>Accents are all over the place here. While the same was true for Ridley Scott's Gladiator, it comes off as a much more glaring flaw here. Indeed, the characters seem to be from around the world, from Farrell's Irish, to Val Kilmer's blatantly American, to Anthony Hopkins' educated Englishman, to Angelina Jolie... who seems to have decided to make her character Transylvanian for some incomprehensible reason... Stone seems to have lost all control of his production, and given up on it, letting it spiral into disarray and confusion.<br/><br/>Stone also seems to have left his actors entirely free to ham it up as they wish, as many of them give what could have been promising performances, had they bothered to tone it down a few notches. Farrell is the best example: he actually isn't bad in the lead, and indeed seems to surpass the overall quality of the movie, but he still fails ultimately to capture our sympathies and enthusiasm. In the end, we end up not really caring about Alexander, and his 'great' exploits, so, despite a valiant effort, he still fails to do the character justice. Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer are similarly wasted as Alexander's insane and deranged parents, both overacting to the point of hysteria. Another bit of advice Stone forgot to provide for most of the film's actors: YELLING DOES NOT EQUAL DRAMA! Not to mention inconsistencies, such as the whole accent issue, and the rather disturbing fact that Jolie, playing Farrell's mother, is in fact a year younger than her 'son'. These are miniscule and unimportant, considering the more glaring flaws the film has to deal with.<br/><br/>Other cast members, seemingly given full reign to do whatever they want, turn out equally unsatisfying performances: Anthony Hopkins comes off as a ranting old fool with no purpose in the story save to serve as a sort of narrator, bestowing endless praises on the film's 'glorious hero'. Jared Leto is given next to nothing to do as Hephaistion, Alexander's childhood friend who turns out to be 'more than a friend'. Rosiaro Dawson is similarly wasted, playing essentially a foreign sex object. Despite the fact that her character is pretty much that shallow, Dawson still manages to turn out one of the film's most impressive performances - which still isn't saying much. <br/><br/>However, not all aspects of the film are as terrible as I make them out to be. The costumes and set design are magnificent, and, unlike the film, actually seem truthful to the time and age. Unfortunately, the music by Greek composer Vangelis (at least one influence on the film is actually Greek!) which accompanies it is one of the worst scores we have been forced to behold in recent history - painfully cheesy and overdone at every point. Rather than adding to the quality of the film, Vangelis' score only serves to remind us of how terrible it is.<br/><br/>As you can tell, I'm not exactly providing a glowing review for the movie here. But it's not often that a film manages to insult my intelligence and provide so many additions to my list of things that annoy me as Alexander. Those only with a bit of excitement or historical inquisitiveness might tentatively want to check out Alexander, but for everyone else, I'd have to strongly discourage it. The film doesn't hold together in any sense, and the result is embarrassing. In fact, the one bit of insight in the entire movie is provided by Anthony Hopkins' Ptolemy - the fact that the character of Alexander is overly glorified through tales of his legendary deeds, and is, in fact, nowhere as great as it is said. So very true. And it can also be said that Alexander's film is not nearly as 'great' as it set out to be. Quite the opposite, in fact. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.<br/><br/>-3/10"

","My friends tell me I have a too pessimistic view of the world and overuse the word ""awful."" Well, they tend to be right, but there is no reason to be coy with this movie. It's awful. The worst part is that someone obviously paid a lot of money to have this movie made.<br/><br/>First of all, let's start with the one thing that is front and center in this movie... Alexander was gay. It seemed to be Oliver Stone's whole point in making this movie. I don't care if he was gay or not, but why did it have to be so vehemently (I love using that word) piled on?<br/><br/>Second, can anyone in this movie act their way out of a paper bag? Not Colin Farrel, certainly not Jared Leto, and most definitely not Angelina Jolie. I'm surprised Colin's eyes didn't pop out on a few of those takes. He certainly tried hard enough... Jared Leto was just too soft to add anything to the picture. Angelina was hideous. There was nothing to like about her character. She talked funny and she had an evil-ugly look to her. No one else really had enough of a part to make a contribution.<br/><br/>Third, perhaps Oliver Stone has not heard of a script, because this movie might have been done without one. There is no dialog that sticks out, and most poignant lines are clichéd.<br/><br/>Fourth, 3-D puzzles are easier to put together than this jumbled mess. The movie might have been better if I could follow it. Having to catch a good look at Colin Farrel's hair to figure out how old he was in each scene was just too difficult. I also have to ask... why did Oliver decide to use a circle wipe before the elephant battle? I replayed that four times and just couldn't figure out why that was in there. While I'm on the subject, what the hell was with all the red when Alexander got hit with the arrow?<br/><br/>Simply put, this movie was a mess. I don't care how historically accurate it was, the material just wasn't delivered in an acceptable manner, and that's the main factor killing this film. If you're looking to see a bad movie just to see a bad movie, then go ahead. But it's a very long movie, too long to enjoy just because it's bad.

","From the moment I saw the trailer for this epic, I was quite anxious to see it. I love Anthony Hopkins and Val Kilmer, Collin Farrel was fantastic in The Recruit and other films, and Oliver Stone was making it. How could it possibly go wrong? When it came out I was loathe to believe the reviews which slammed it and tore it to pieces, and finally I went to see it on the biggest screen I could find and I gave it the best chance it could have had. What a loser. This film, although just over three hours, feels like an eternity. The plot wanders all over and feels far more like a made for TV docudrama than a major feature film. After the first scene or two the pace slows to a crawl, but does pick up for a battle scene or two. However even these which are well realized and intense briefly, fail to resolve, and we leave the battle field wondering what the heck just happened. I don't care how historically accurate or inaccurate it is, it is a horrible story. Perhaps Stone should have found one event around which to base the film instead of trying to give a passing overview. The characters were completely non-empathetic and there was simply no chemistry or development of his loves, both male and female. The real Alexander the Great may or may not have slept with his male friend, but I somehow doubt that he was the feminine eye-shadow sporting, sensitive lad that this film portrayed him as. Or if he was, they shouldn't have made a major Hollywood film about him because the market of people interested in such an antagonist is a tiny fraction of the typical filmgoing audience. All said and done, the horse vs. elephant sequence was brilliant (appart from some odd and poorly justified colour alteration) but the rest of the film had me glancing at my watch every few minutes, hoping that I could leave this disgrace of a film."

","The movie itself is a self-fulfilling prophecy as characters warn about sacrificing traditional austerity for wealth and pomp: Perhaps this happened to the filmmakers who had upwards of a hundred million dollars to work with. So maybe they felt they had to make it over-the-top instead of relying on a decent solid script.<br/><br/>There are good things about this movie, but it is outweighed by negatives. The good is that there are many historically accurate facts: Aristotle was Alexander's tutor. Olympias raised Alexander to think he's a son of Zeus. Although the Greeks won by masterly employment of cavalry, the Persians also used cavalry. Cleitus and Parmenion were indeed killed.<br/><br/>But the focus is somehow off. There is too much talking, too much reiteration, not enough action (there was a wealth of battles to choose from). That would be fine if the talking taught us more about history, but it usually happened in a totally unrealistic way. For instance, the scene where Philip is drunk and attacks Alexander. It was too verbose, and why was Olympias watching from afar? Why not keep it simple and true to the account? Why not have Alexander say simply and proudly, ""What am I then, a bastard?"" Then have Philip rush at Alexander immediately and trip--that would be spontaneous, interesting.<br/><br/>For that matter, why rename Attalus' daughter from Cleopatra to Euterpe? Is it because Oliver Stone felt audiences would confuse her with the queen of Egypt? Why use the word 'guerilla' in a BC film unless the film was consistently anachronistic (like Shakespeare)?<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie was Alexander himself. It is true that Alexander was sensitive, intelligent, brave, and disturbed. They tried to show his sensitive side too much, and as the movie went on he got more and more whiny, and this is where I turned the movie off. I think it would have been much more compelling to portray him as a narcissist who snaps without warning.<br/><br/>Take the scene where he kills Cleitus: Alexander was blubbering a lot, and you could tell exactly what was going to happen. It would be far more compelling if Cleitus talked to him like that thinking that Alexander wouldn't get mad. Then suddenly Alexander snaps and throws the spear at him. Only then Alexander bursts out crying realizing what he's done.<br/><br/>Also, going back and forth in time was really irritating and destroyed a lot of suspense that could've built up. Sorry for such a longwinded review on my part, but it is a really interesting story that needs to be done right. This and the film ""W"" confirm my impression that Oliver Stone is overrated.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is that it made me want to cross-check it with the real historical facts."
"TheLittleSongbird","2","14","21","23 April 2011"," Great spectacle but poor everything else
","I do like epics, and while I am not a historian I do take an interest in it. But Alexander didn't work for me at all. The best thing about Alexander are the production values. The scenery and sets are very grand and lavish, and the costumes are wonderful too. The cinematography, editing and symbolism are nice too, but strictly speaking they verge on being too flashy and don't add anything.<br/><br/>Production values aside, everything else simply doesn't work. Vangelis's music is disappointing, it does have its epic parts, but it overall is too grandiose and overpowering for my liking. The story benefits from a great idea and if explored wonderfully could have given us a thorough insight into Alexander the Great. However, the storytelling told in meandering flashback structure is stodgily told, and any parts that could have been so interesting are instead superfluously explored especially Alexander and the battlefield, and I would say the same for the sketchy characterisation too. The battle scenes are beautifully shot but uncompelling.<br/><br/>Alexander also has some pretty dreadful acting, which is disappointing considering how good some of the actors are. Colin Farrell tries but is somewhat too effeminate and he does have too many moments where he is not charismatic enough. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful, and she actually has given some good performances despite what has been said about her, but she being too young is hopelessly miscast as is Val Kilmer, while the normally reliable(in many cases even wonderful) Anthony Hopkins is the only one who gives anything close to a good performance. I was really disappointed at how woefully underused Brian Blessed, Christopher Plummer and Rosario Dawson were as well. Worst of the lot is Jared Leto, whose acting and presence is so wooden and lifeless it makes a wooden plank much more animated.<br/><br/>The acting and superfluous storytelling are big problems, but it is nothing compared to the script, which is toe-curlingly bad. There is also the cumbersome length, pedestrian pace and Oliver Stone's direction which is rather pretentious(a term I try to avoid like the plague but the term applies when talking about the direction here).<br/><br/>In conclusion, it may have great spectacle but there are too many poor assets that made Alexander in all honesty a chore to watch. 2/10 Betahny Cox"

Do yourself a *HUGE* favor and rent Troy or Gladiator instead; at least these either tell a story reasonably well or evoke an emotional connection to the characters. This movie doesn't do that; it feels like a Hollywood studio exec threw some money at some random well-known actors, and asked them to appear in a movie.

","This film moved me to register with IMDb just to say how awful it was. No, not because of the relationship with Hephaestion. That's historical. But because of the all-over-the-place direction. Platoon to the nth degree! right to the slo-mo encounter between stallion and elephant. Misdirected by Oliver Stone, ""Alexander"" spends most of his time either with his huge eyebrows slanted up in a worried direction, or bellowing like Joan of Arc in ""The Messenger"". Two basic expressions. Poor Val Kilmer gets to do a nice Oliver Reed impression. As far as history goes, we're provided with a quote from Virgil (70 bc or so) right at the start, which Alexander then repeats about 300 years earlier. (Virgil stole it from Alex, right?) Alexander was a truly amazing strategist. The first battle in this film was such a disorganized, overblown mess that this was hardly apparent. Also, the film made it seem as if that was it, one big battle, empire conquered. It was his continued consistent victorious streak against all odds that amazed people and kept his men with him for years on end. Yet hardly any of his other successes were mentioned. His continued brinksmanship with Darius was largely ignored. Where was the building of the bridge to the island? Where were the things that made him such a superstar of antiquity, such as the oracle from Zeus in Egypt, or the cutting of the Gordian knot? Instead we see him coaching his men with some new-agey pop psychology and multicultural idealism. (This didn't make sense either--on one hand he was all about the equality of all cultures, on the other he kept talking about bringing enlightenment to the barbarians) Not very likely for a Macedonian warrior, whose motives were more likely power, glory, and to outshine his father. I know it's hard to make a good movie, but this one was just a dog's breakfast."
"buystuff-1","5","7","9","8 January 2006"," A muddled story of what could have been an epic
","Alexander is one of those movies that people either love or hate, and while I see a few glimmers of what could have been a great epic, in summary it's a mess. I could write a small book about the issues I had with the movie, but here's the highlights: <br/><br/>Alexander's motivation- Why did he want to conquer? In Stone's view it was his mother pushing him, to be accepted after death by his father, to avenge his father, to reach the end of the earth and conquer anyone in his way, and to unite Asia and Greece. Any of these would have sufficed, instead we have too many to see a strong influence. Of them all, the uniting of Greece and Asia was perhaps the most profound and the one he most likely was unaware of in real life. A lot of the audience probably didn't know that Babylon was in modern Iraq, and Bactria was in Afghanistan. If they had truly been united in one empire, the world would be a very different place.<br/><br/>Alexander and Hephaestion's relationship- Depending on who's talking they were either lovers or the truest of friends. I won't step into the argument over which version was most likely true, just that you never really see the two being friends or particularly close until a scene where they start professing their undying....very-good-friendship to each other. Hephaestion is instead one of many lovers Alexander takes, male and female, and it was hard to see any real bond between them.<br/><br/>Historical trimming- Alexander did an awful lot in a short time, still Stone left out some parts that were essential, such as the untying of the Gordian Knot. Bagoas was a manipulator in Darius's court, and a power behind the throne. He was also the only person named as a beloved of Alexander and was eventually suspected of being involved in Philip's murder. Instead, Stone presents Bagoas as another pretty face lounging in the harem.<br/><br/>General inaccuracies/stupidity- In Stone's view of the ancient world, Greeks spoke with Irish accents, assassins would always stand before their victims and give long and guilty looks, and Macedonian kings would casually toss servant boys at their wedding over the table and rape them. I've usually heard that Alexander was dark haired, but if Stone wanted to make him blonde, why a color that looks deliberately dyed? <br/><br/>Who are you supposed to like?- True, the ancient world was another place, where views on sexuality and the male use of eyeliner were seen differently. Stone revels in trying to push these differences in our face (many of which are debatable) but never gives us characters we identify with or root for. Gladiator took even more liberties with history, yet the character of Maximus was very sympathetic. Alexander is presented by Stone as amoral, destructive, and more than a little weird.<br/><br/>Even more ironic is that the story arc of Alexander is, despite the trappings, incredibly conventional. Boy is born seeming destined for greatness, rises high, falters, loses friends, and ends in tragedy. That pretty much describes most of the hero epics out there. If all of us who don't like the persona of Alexander Stone presented just ""don't get it"" or aren't open minded enough, that's more Stone's failure as a director than our lack of appreciation for his work."
"dalshaugeric","1","20","32","17 May 2006"," This is not Alexander nor is it Great
","This is a shining example of what a movie about Alexander the Great should not be. Yes, men in those times were all bisexual, didn't matter if it was woman or man, it was simply love. Yes, Alexander's personal life must of been tumultuous. But this is not what I want in a film about the possibly history's greatest military leader I want Alexander the Great, not Alexander the wimpy, oedipal crybaby. I want to see his tactical genius, his charisma, his bravery. I don't want to see him cry after Guagalamela, what should of been an uplifting and heroic victory. And another thing, why were there only 2 battles in a movie about a great conqueror? Where was Chaeronea, Granicus, Issus, Tyre? Where was the river at Hydaspes? And on that note, the Battle of the Hydaspes River was a thrilling victory for the Macedonians, not a bloody near-defeat, nor was Alexander wounded and his horse killed at Hydaspes. Bucephalus died shortly afterwords of weariness and old age And what's with this Oedipus Complex? Alexander didn't have incestuous tension with his mother, that's just prime choice, grade A BS! He conquered the known world because of his ambition and his will to be remembered for all eternity, like his idol, Achilles. Not because he was afraid of his mother! I don't need to know about Alexander's sex life, a movie about a man like this should be about his achievements, not about who he had sex with! This is not Alexander and it certainly is not great!"
"demank","10","100","192","13 January 2005"," Alexander as one of us.
","(I am here talking about the movie, not history.)<br/><br/>In Babylon, Hephaestion asked Alexander:""Sometimes I wondered if you are just running away from your mother?""<br/><br/>I find this one of the many interesting issues this movie has to offer us.<br/><br/>In the movie, Alexander was far-most a dreamer chaser. He was in a dream nobody can understand. (I am not sure even Hephaestion did.) Great or not, it is left for the history and time to judge or mis-judge. <br/><br/>Alexander's family didn't offer him a lot of comforts. His father was not particularly loving and his mother ever so manipulative and demanding. So I understand very well that the life of reality for Alexander at home had little meaning, so he set out to chase his dreams. Alexander loved his father greatly and so did he love his mother. But this puts him into such great conflict that finally, when his father was murdered and his mother seemingly involved in the crime, he collapsed. So he left, for his conquest of the known world and shut himself into his own dream. What is this dream: to Conquer the world, to bring freedom to people, or just to be away as far as he could from home. We do not and can not understand his dream because we are not him. But in the movie, it is strongly portrayed that he was a man devoted to his dream and he was a lonely man. A sad lonely man that nobody understood. Hephaestion was probably catching a bit understanding of Alexander's dream but by far sharing it. Yet Hephaestion was by far more understanding than all the rest. So it is normal for Alexander to feel for Hephaestion. Imagine ourselves, when we are lonely and weary, what will we feel for the friend who comes to us and comforts us. It is love, it is friendship and they are the same thing. (Sorry, no sex involved here and that's why again it shows how great Mr. Stone did the job by showing the strong bond in between Alexander and Hephaestion, but emphasizing no sex involved, just purity.) Alexander did feel for his wife as well, but was it a mere reflection of his mother, we will never know. Yet again, this possibility is implied in the movie. Great job. Who doesn't have a little dream of certain kind within the deepest heart of each and every of us. But Alexander was great because he can bring his dream chasing to such an extreme. No matter how much land he conquered, no matter how many people he killed, he did it at no cost to chase his dream. <br/><br/>That's what I think, in a deep level, Mr. Stone wants to imply in his movie. The movie is not Alexander the Great (or the Wars of Alexander), but Alexander, as a person, but a unique person. He was strong and was weak, he was divine and he made mistakes. And that's why I like the movie. The movie left a lot of thoughts after watching, on a lot of levels and aspects. In exploration of the world, Alexander was exploring himself. In chasing the phantom of perfection in his way, Alexander conquered the world and the history.<br/><br/>I am very grateful that Mr. Stone offered us a different angle to view a well celebrated historical Hero (or not, up to you). An angle that was not expected and anticipated by the waiting audience, that's why it flopped. But it is an excellent movie for me. Every bits and pieces has a reason to be there. (It is up to us to interpret.) It is by far not a boring movie. Mr. Stone delivered so many messages and there are so many things to pick up. I would have found it boring if it just repeats what these biographic writing does and no way a movie can match books in terms of biography. The is a story of Alexander told by Oliver Stone, and it is told with great beauty, visually and emotionally. I hope by time, people will realize the value in this movie than just great battle scenes or heroic speeches (and aren't these battles and speeches enough by now in cinema).<br/><br/>After all let's be more moderate to a movie as an audience. After all, we sit comfortably and watch while hundreds worked very hard to deliver us movies. There is never a really bad movie if the crew has been devoted to the making. The pre-requisite of art is devotion (then comes talent and skills). One audience like ourselves can only say, Yes I like it, No I don't. It is the least one can say that Mr. Stone and all his actors and crews have been very devoted to the movie. And for me, I really enjoyed every minute of Alexander.<br/><br/>PS. Yesterday I watched again, and I actually heard some people applause at the end and I happily joined them."

It's truly disappointing that they choose to leave out such an important part, but then again, who'd want this movie any longer? So how did Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins)know all of Alexander's doings? Then there's this 10 years later, and 9 years earlier business.

This movie was like a 70-80 western movie and had nothing to do with history. Persian dresses were not correct, not even a Persian face was used.

","Aside from the Macedonian's with Irish accents and a plot that...well there is no plot to speak of, this has to be the most horrid film I have seen in recent years. This ""film"", and I use the term loosely, is of course the reason why Oliver Stone should NOT direct, act, produce or otherwise be involved with film making. There is no structure to the production other than a series of battles strung together with little or no story to imply (and by the way you might not see this interpretation if you don't know the history of Alexander the Great) that while he was a great general he was also obsessive compulsive and perhaps a bit insane. Then of course you can't forget that Oliver Stone still thinks it's the 60's and that the psychedelic red hue to the musically enshrined scene should encapsulate the art form and depict the bloodiness of the battle. Yeah...right. I am not sure I should go a step further to say that if you are going to depict the true nature of relationships from that period DO IT!!! Don't dance around the subject because you are afraid of public reaction and by all means get actors that aren't terrified their machismo will be affected by what it represents. Kudos that from a distance (and with an unknown) he could do it but close up and to simply say I love you....oops over the shoulder and not in the eye. Pathetic. My recommendation for this film.

It seems like Oliver Stone thinks he doesn't have to work anymore. This movie proves that. Mr Stone, you cant light a bag of cow dung on fire and expect people to see it or like it because it has ""Directed By Oliver Stone"" under the title.

","I'm here to say that I didn't care if Alexander depicted gayness or not. I know enough of history to know that of the Greek culture. I'm here to say the movie was bad. Even Stone knew it as he edited out scenes for the director's cut. The narrative rambles and jumps around constantly, all the characters stay at arms length, the battle scenes are very few and poorly done, and Alexander comes off as a tyrant conquering the poor ignorant savages for their own good while caring nothing of the lives of his men. His claim to have shared everything with his men comes off cold and his attempts to bolster his men's courage come off as patronizing. It may be just my personal dislike that the characters are all either boring or stiff, but the cut of the movie is horrid. From Alexander's youth to his teens, to the last battle with Darius (for all intents and purposes) then when you think another gorilla war will take the movie Darius is found dead. True to history, yes, dramatic? no! Stone seems to be jumping around trying to cover this and that with no idea how to edit down the movie to a dramatic core. Even when conspiracies are unmasked it rushes ahead to their execution. Every time the scene changes I wonder where we are off too. The past? present? future? Fans of this film need to stop blaming the right wingers for some anti-gay conspiracy. It's just a bad movie from a guy who can often cross the line between brilliant and awful."

","Alexander ""Director's Cut"" is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever forced myself to watch. Oliver Stone is living proof that there is a very fine line between genius and madness. He has crossed that line and proves once again that he is no Cecil B. DeMille. His lack of focus is evident throughout. His inability to provide any semblance of continuity is the lowest form of trickery, in an attempt to disguise his shortcomings as a professional. More disgusting is how he abuses history in all his ""works"" to present his prejudices, his sexual orientations, his perversions and total disregard for the truth. Despite the over abundance of muddled camera angles, action scenes that do not allow one to distinguish who is ""gutting"" whom, extensive use of computer graphics,etc, the director was unable to put together anything more than non-sensual sequences with flashbacks that distracted from rather weird dialogue and unrealistic interactions between the characters. I must admit that his casting director did a fine job of casting Jolie as a weirdo, Farrell as a less than a ladies man and Kilmer as a one eyed jerk. (Who did the makeup on Kilmer? The makeup was better in the original ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" which was made in the 40's (or earlier)... Alexander ""Directors Cut"" was so bad that I've made myself a promise.. If Oliver Stone's name appears anywhere near a movie I think I want to see, I will fore go that opportunity. No doubt the movie will make millions as people seem to have forgotten what a good movie is suppose to be. Hollywood is no longer in the hands of artists."

","I went to see this movie last week after it came out. And I looked here for advice, even though most of the reviews didn't favor the movie I went to see it any way. Boy did I see something different then what they did. It was just a true story of a man, a leader of an Empire. It was all the things that I expected from it. There have always been major disputes over Alexander's intentions for what he did. I personally feel that this movie picked the true ones. He lived for the people; he gave himself for them, fighting side by side with them. Alexander was an inspiration for the people of a huge era. <br/><br/>And for all of you out they're who say that his movie has nothing of a historical background I have this to say. This is taken from the World Book Encyclopedia. ""Alexander the Great (356-323 Bc) was the first world conqueror and one of the most remarkable men in history. He led his armies almost to the end of what was then the civilized world. Alexander was born in Pella, Macedonia, the son of Philip of Macedon, who was an excellent general. His mother Olympias, Princess of Eprius, she was brilliant and hot tempered. Alexander inherited the best qualities from both his parents. But he was even more ambitious then his father. Alexander's mother taught him that Achilles was his ancestor, and that his father was a descendant of Hercules. He also learned the Iliad, a story about the deeds of Achilles, which he carried with him everywhere he went. Achilles became Alexander's model in all things."" This is only a brief section about Alexander the Great. If you people would only pick up a history book every now and again maybe you would realize what you are actually seeing.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, which is meant to be biographical, you see Alexander in his life. There are exact quotes from his father such as, "" O my son, seek out a kingdom worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is too little for thee."" Also there is a close attention to detail, if you would notice during the night of his wedding, there was a dagger and a copy of the Iliad under his pillows. How can you sit there and bash a true piece of World History? It's not meant to be a movie about war scenes, how bloody does each side gets, it is a movie about a man. Who are you to dare a legacy that will live last past your own lifetime?<br/><br/>The movie has amazing visuals, worthy of the Sun God. The acting was well done other then a few overacted and lengthy sections. The battle scenes were worthy of praise. Overall I would have to say that this is one of the best historical movies that I have seen in a very long time."
"Slack_Er","4","12","18","31 December 2005"," This movie proves that too many drugs will ruin even the most gifted filmmakers
","After watching this film, I came to realize that if the real Alexander the Great looked anywhere near as weird as Colin Farrell with a giant blonde wig, that was probably the distraction he used to stay alive in so many battles. I'm sure that soldiers everywhere dropped their swords in confusion when faced with the awkward blonde menace. I don't blame Farrell for being horribly miscast in this film because I didn't think Val Kilmer was realistic as Philip of Macedonia either. As a matter of fact, the only convincing character was Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother, and she is probably younger than her on-screen son, Colin Farrell! I tried to find the message in this movie, I really tried. After sleeping... I mean sitting through all three hours of the director's cut, the best I could come up with was that it's cool to conquer the world. Alexander the Great's feats make for impressive history books, but the movie seems as shallow as the Hollywood setting it spawns from because of so little self-sacrifice and true meaning to Alexander's life. I guess I should give Oliver Stone some props for sticking with historical fact and giving Alexander a ""feminine male friend"" but I admit, my 21st century American bias made it difficult to accept that a man who led thousands of brave soldiers also enjoyed having his nails manicured by transvestites. Speaking of Oliver Stone, I think the biggest lesson of this movie is to stay off drugs. Stone made notorious headlines lately for his many drug escapades, and after watching classics like ""Platoon"" and ""Wall Street,"" and then viewing his contemporary stuff such as ""Alexander,"" it makes me realize that too many drugs will affect any brilliant mind."

"thale05","3","5","6","18 November 2012"," A Disappointment Literally of Epic Proportions
","I really don't know where to begin to discuss what went wrong with this movie. Going into it, you would presume ""Alexander"" was in good hands with Oliver Stone and a sterling ensemble of performers. Before it hit theaters in 2004, the hype surrounding the premise was so overrated it was rumored to be a potential Oscar contender. After my first viewing, I could not comprehend the negative reception; all I came for was some history lesson and battle scenes. I certainly grew wiser about movies over the years since then so I decided to give it another go. Now, I have come to the conclusion ""Alexander"" is a bloated, lost mess even if superficially striking.<br/><br/>The history of Alexander the Great needs no extensive introduction for his legacy and impact of world conquest lasts to this very day. As I am typing this review, US military forces in Afghanistan look at the same mountains and landscape the young ruler beheld in his life. Because of Alexander, Greek culture reached as far as Persia to India and fostered the beginning of a Hellenistic civilization. The film is a biopic of Alexander (played by Colin Farrell) and his campaigns but I'm befuddled how Stone does not go into depth the effect the man had made in history. Instead he studies Alexander's personal life, something I'm not against. However, I would like films about historical leaders to touch base on the achievements of an individual, the contributions to whatever society is at stake. That being said, this film mentions the influence of Alexander scarcely.<br/><br/>To further elaborate on the protagonist, his intentions and motivations to conquer the known world become vague. At the start, Alexander justifies the Persian conquest as retribution; as he presses onward, he mentions freeing the people he encounters along his journeys. Then the objective becomes more idealistic and set upon glory. There was a point I wondered whether his mother Olympias (played by Angelina Jolie) served as a manipulator for Alexander's journey. The case I'm trying to make is Alexander never gives a clear, concise goal to accomplish and it only makes the audience feel isolated from the story.<br/><br/>One of the more sensitive topics Stone brings up is the alleged bisexuality of Alexander the Great. The implication of the king having an intimate relationship with his best friend Hephaistion (played by Jared Leto) does not bother me; my concern is towards the point of making his sexuality a recurrent topic. Is it a conflict the king struggles with? No, not really. Even when he marries a bride, the subject of his affections is hardly examined; it doesnÃ¢(TM)t warrant having a place in the plot. If a movie continues to remind us of a protagonist's sexuality, it ought to have a significant part.<br/><br/>The performers are given a script with lines akin to a re-election campaign speech of President Obama. Elegant wording yet you've heard it all before, yearning for something new. Remember this is Oliver Stone who has penned fantastic screenplays from ""Midnight Express"" to ""Scarface"" to ""Platoon"". As for the performances themselves, it is a disaster listening to respected actors use varying accents from Colin Farrell's authentic Irish to Angelina Jolie's faux Russian. Jolie has the weirdest role of the cast as the snake fetish mother of Alexander whom she gives the impression of having an Oedipus relationship with. Accents aside, the speeches, monologues, and dialogues are either dull as Anthony Hopkins' narration or plain atrocious as Farrell's ""Braveheart"" address to his troops.<br/><br/>Apart from all the faults, ""Alexander"" is, on its surface, pretty. The costumes and set pieces are appropriately exotic in Babylon while the battles fought are both kinetic and brutal. The Indian fight wages men on horses against opponents riding war-equipped elephants, then unknown to the Macedonians. Impaling, hacking, dismemberment, and stomping do not hesitate in this particular battle. While these bloody feuds won't be revered or remembered like the clashes in ""Gladiator"" or ""Lord of the Rings"", they will not disappoint the ardent admirers of warfare.<br/><br/>If ""Alexander"" wasn't the worst movie of 2004, it was the most over-hyped one. Since then, it has undergone different cuts for the home release. I found the movie more disappointing than embarrassing to watch given the credentials of the people on board. The lesson of this review is simple: never prejudge a movie by its credits. Alexander the Great will always be remembered, Oliver Stone's ""Alexander""? Not so much.<br/><br/>My Rating: 3/10"

","I'm a big fan of epics, of Greek and Roman history, of anything where you get to see one guy with a sword smack someone else with a sword. So, for that simple reason, Alexander was something of a disappointment. The combat scenes were sadly lacking in enthusiasm. But this aside.<br/><br/>I often wonder if, at the bottom of Stone's Lifetime Achievement Award, there reads a plaque as to why he has it. I'm not sure if 'Taking the most interesting person in history and making the most boring film in history about him' would fit, but it's worth a try. I don't want to sound like I'm attacking Mr. Stone personally, but it was one of the biggest ego-boosts of a film that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>So many major plot points simply glossed over, the burning of Persapolis, the years in exile during his youth, the infamous Knot... why cut out the interesting bits? So that we could see more scenes of his army walking very, very slowly? Very accurate and all in appearance, just very, very dull.<br/><br/>One of the reasons that Troy was a success compared to Alexander. Troy had no real relevance to the history involved. But it was damned entertaining. Alexander simply wasn't. It failed to deliver on any of the things that should have made an Alexander movie truly Great.<br/><br/>Swing and very, very long and pointless miss."
"cculianu","3","5","6","1 October 2006"," Why the Irish accents ? (and other points..)
","Several points:<br/><br/>1. Why are all the actors (except for Angelina Jolie) using *IRISH* (or even some Scottish) accents? They could have tried for a neutral American or perhaps (gasp) even a fake Greek accent, like Angelina Jolie did. I think the choice to instruct the actors to use *IRISH* accents is a terrible one. Like it or not, the Irish accent has no place in ancient Greece. This isn't Braveheart. It just makes the dialog laughable and unwatchable. <br/><br/>You can't have ancient Greeks speaking in Irish accents. It's ludicrous. You might as well have them use a German or French accent. Hell, throw in a few Jamaican, Haitian, Trinidadian and Bangladeshi accents too just to mix it up. Oh and a Swedish would be fun. ""Svedish meatballs ja ja, conquering India ja ja.""<br/><br/>If you want an example of what a movie *should* do accent-wise: The movie ""Troy"" did a better job with accents. Not a single Irish accent in ancient Greece. Either they used a neutral British or a neutral American or even a fake Greek. <br/><br/>At first I thought perhaps the majority of the actors are Irish. However further investigation revealed that even Actors that aren't Irish, like Connor Paolo (who is a native New Yorker) has a slight, annoying, brogue. *It doesn't make any sense whatsoever!!* Unless the idiot director told them to do it. In which case it's highly idiotic.<br/><br/>2. Why is the acting so bad? Even Anthony Hopkins' performance is lackluster. This must be due to terrible directing and a pretty mediocre script.<br/><br/>3. Why is it that the same 3 guys get cast as supporting roles in all these historical epic war movies? A few of the supporting cast in this movie also were seen movies like Braveheart and Gladiator for example. It's really quite predictable."
"agsconnolly","3","5","6","6 August 2006"," Not the film it should have been
","I have to say that I was really quite alarmed, not to mention disappointed, at how poor this film generally was. It would have worked better as an epic, historical action film which examines the true character of the film's main figure. However, Oliver Stone attempted to incorporate several confusing, drawn out personal incidents and strained relationships into the film, with the incidental backdrop of war and the conquering of enormous countries. As a result, Stone essentially neglects to tell the story of how Alexander came to be such an all-conquering warrior, and gives the illusion that his conquests were made simply by turning up.<br/><br/>One of the main issues with the film is that the central characters - despite their lengthy screen time and the numerous incidents each is embroiled in - are never stripped bare for the viewer for long enough for them to be more than two dimensional. For example, Alexander's volatile relationship with his father is baffling throughout the movie, swinging as it does between mutual affection and abject hatred. Similarly, it is never explained fully as to why his mother is quite so scheming and harbours so much anger towards his father.<br/><br/>All these things aside, the true problem with the film is the standard of the acting. Being a high-strung drama, it requires performances that are sincere whilst also not patronising or over-cooking it for the viewer. Unfortunately, the film does not possess a single strong performance. Colin Farrell is uncomfortable, if willing, in the lead role, a fact not helped by the Director's decision to make Alexander's male friends and generals speak with Northern Irish accents so as not to draw attention to Farrell's own accent. Val Kilmer is hackneyed and perhaps mis-cast as Alexander's father, and Angelina Jolie's performance as Farrell's mother is bordering on the catastrophic. Despite her wicked beauty, she demonstrates that she has neither the versatility nor earnestness to act at this level.<br/><br/>Finally, the simple presentation of the movie is flawed. The opening scenes, which show Anthony Hopkins in one of his more pointless roles, are set against a computer-generated backdrop which could not have looked less real had it been a charcoal drawing. Later scenes, whilst expensively produced, give the impression, perhaps deliberately, of theatrical stage scenery. If this is intended, then it is negated by the lengthy scenes outdoors, which again feature unwelcome CGI.<br/><br/>On the whole, the film is actually rather dull. It does not present its subject matter with sufficient power to hold the viewer's interest and the 2 hours, 30 mins running time leaves you longing for an end. The one scene that is worth seeing is one in which Alexander and his horse square up to an Indian soldier on an elephant. Unusually for the film, it is beautifully shot and wonderfully engaging. But it lasts only a few seconds."
"cbratteli","3","5","6","12 January 2006"," Before there was Brokeback Mountain, there was Alexander.
","An Oliver Stone mistake, for sure, since he co-wrote as well as directed this picture which was well-funded and contains actors ranging from at least adequate to outstanding. Stone's interpretation of Alexander's close and possibly homosexual relationship to Hephaistion, as well as his interpretation of male relationships in general at the time, seems to be one of a band of scrawny effeminate warriors who alternate their time between swordplay and soapy emotive conversations about their feelings. Perhaps the only believable male portrayal in the movie was val Kilmer's Philip. These were hard rational warriors--lost eyes, scars, large builds from a life of training, coarse behavior from a life of extremes of deprivation and excessive living, and cold calculation which allowed them to survive intrigue--Kilmer seems to be the only one who understands this. Everyone else in the movie acted like a lost teenager or flat out crybaby. But then, the actors don't write their own lines, so it is hard to blame them.<br/><br/>So most of the casting, nearly all of the dialog, and the interactions between the characters was all like a bad old costume drama--what about the special effects? Well, I had heard the movie was bad, but I have become accustomed to seeing badly written movies for their spectacular visuals (Harry Potter series, Star Wars series, etc.) In Alexander I was looking forward to the recreations of each of Alexander's most famous adventures along his campaign through Asia and Egypt. Don't hold your breath. Two visuals are worthwhile: one fairly well shown battle scene, and the reasonably well recreated Babylon. No Gordian knot. No siege of Tyre. No building of his Alexandrias. Much else was missing as well. No hearing the oracles in Egypt tell him he was descended from Zeus. No perspective that he was tutored by one of the most incredible minds that ever existed (other than multiple ""Remember what Aristotle said"" lines). No perspective on the carefully crafted and pragmatic policy of integrating Greek with Persian culture in the conquered lands, just silly tirades by Alexander about how nobody understood him. Or did I sleep through those parts? Hard to tell how much I missed between dozing, laughing, and cringing.<br/><br/>It is true that the persistent homosexual references are very distracting, perhaps in part because of cultural differences. Mostly, however, this is because the interactions are portrayed in a ludicrous way. To pull the modern audience into the world of Alexander would have been to treat these relationships as they were regarded at the time--unremarkable, and not to make them the centerpiece of every other scene. Macedonians and Persians did not marvel at Alexander for his man-love, nor is that his unique lasting legacy to us.<br/><br/>Absence of character development, corny shallow dialog, bad casting, and disappointing visual effects somehow come together to make the epic true story of Alexander seem utterly silly and uninteresting. Nice job, Stone."

","Don't let the defenders fool you. This movie is atrocious and it has absolutely nothing to do with Alexander's sexuality. His sexuality (questioned by many critics, I happen to believe he was homosexual) is one of the very few things about this movie which is well-written.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are few and far between. The scenes we do get (Gaugamela and India) are haphazardly put together at best. The rest of the film seems to rest on the bizarre concept that Alexander is only conquering the world to escape his mother.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie (and why is she cast as Olympias??), normally the bright spot in any film, doesn't help the picture. She has been given the direction to use some sort of anachronistic ""Transylvanian"" accent that would do better in a Hammer Dracula movie than in this piece.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer looks as if he wants to leave the film as soon as possible and the only real genuine emotion I felt during the film was pity for him.<br/><br/>The blonde wigged Colin Farrell is far worse. He seems to jump back and forth from a caricature to an absurdity with great ease and lightning speed.<br/><br/>Even Anthony Hopkins could not save this film.<br/><br/>I give it a 3 because, after studying ancient history for most of my life, the computer generated scenes of Alexandria and Babylon are one of the few joys to be had in this film."

","I have read all the bad comments about this movie and I went to see it not expecting much. I love the story of Alexander and so I would have gone to see the movie regardless of any comments. However I thought it was truly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I hate to say it, but I have come to the conclusion that Americans (and I am sorry to generlize that), do not get historic movies. Maybe because they do not have any idea about history outside the US? Or about differencies in culture? The frequently remarked 'gayness' is really annoying because in ancient times, they did not have the same moral code as we have now, so the movie was actually portrayed accurately. To follow the Greek history, is rather hard and I was not too impressed with the comments by Anthony Hopkins (I would have preferred to see what he was talking about) but still, the movie is great, Colin Farrell does an excellent job and I do not understand the bad reviews. All I can say is, go and see the movie and then judge for yourself."
"Lechuguilla","Null","8","11","21 July 2008"," Another Sword And Sandal Epic
","Hollywood star power and tons of money can't save this overwrought, melodramatic story of the life and times of Alexander The Great (Colin Farrell), the Greek warrior who conquered lands in times B.C.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem here is the script, and in particular the plot structure. Just as viewers are getting familiar with a plot sequence, the time period of the story shifts backward to a previous era, or forward to a future era. Displayed on the screen as ""10 Years Earlier"" or ""40 Years Later"" or ""9 Years Earlier"" or ""8 Years Later"", back and forth we go. It's maddening. It makes the story, which already contains too many characters with strange names, muddled and hard to follow. Director Oliver Stone apparently tries to cram in too much information; as such, the story's scope is too broad. Another possibility is that the time-shifts were necessitated in post-production editing. But whatever the cause, the screen story's convoluted plot is a huge barrier to understanding Alexander and the people in his life.<br/><br/>In addition, the script's dialogue contains too much exposition, mostly from Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) who, via numerous monologues, lectures us about Greek history. Again, one gets the impression that Stone is trying too hard to make the film a comprehensive history lesson.<br/><br/>Non-script elements are not much better. Casting for the main parts is poor. I like Angelina Jolie, but she is no Olympias. And Colin Farrell, with his golden locks, would fit better in a modern day romantic comedy. Acting is hammy, at times almost laughably so. Actors don't communicate with each other so much as they speechify. Every line of dialogue is heavy with import. Even the film's makeup is overdone. Jared Leto, with all that eyeliner, looks like a drag queen.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best element of the film is the color cinematography. It's quite good. Some of the landscapes are visually sweeping and majestic. And I liked that ethereal background music from Vangelis. Also, the costumes are colorful and apparently quite authentic.<br/><br/>I like Oliver Stone. But I have never cared for sword and sandal movies. They always seem pretentious, so proud of themselves, in their extended runtimes and sweeping scope. ""Alexander"" is no exception; it muddles along for nearly three hours, and covers most of one man's lifetime as he conquers lands from the Mediterranean to the Far East.<br/><br/>Maybe Oliver Stone would have been better advised to confine his saga to a smaller, more restricted story, one wherein viewers can get to know the protagonist and his inspirations and challenges. In its present form, ""Alexander"" is just too sprawling and epical to warrant any enthusiasm from me."

","Any man that could conquer such a vast portion of the world in only ten years with the technology constraints of the ancient world must have been not only a great military genius, but also a genius of a politician and an extremely charismatic figure. Once he had established his uncanny skill on the battlefield, many cities throughout the world surrendered and joined his empire without even putting up a fight. After Alexander defeated Darius III, the Persians at Babylon greeted him as a god. Despite being one of the most legendary human beings that has ever lived, Oliver Stone astoundingly decided to focus the majority of the film on something as petty as the sex life of Alexander the Great.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone portrays Alexander as moody, spoiled, weak, and alarmingly indecisive. If the true Alexander had acted even close to the way that Stone portrays him, there is no doubt that his advisers would have assassinated him before he had even set foot in Persia. Stone's Alexander actually screams like a girl and throws a tantrum at least twice in the movie.<br/><br/>As for the battle choreography, it is probably the worst of a major film in the past ten years at the very least. It may not even have been revolutionary if it had been shot in 1960. The Battle of Gaugamela, one of the greatest victories in the history of the world, that left the army of Darius, King of Kings, completely annihilated and his empire open for free reign, is depicted by Stone to be remarkably slow-paced and anti-climactic.<br/><br/>In short, it is inconceivable that the producers deemed this film worthy of investment, and it is a sacrilege to the great man and a stain on his memory that this travesty of a film was ever made."

","What evil happened to Ollie Stone? I can admit that re-constructing the history of a great leader such as Alexander is not that easy for a modern filmmaker. But Oliver Stone seemed to be very self-confident about this matter...and I trusted him. Well, the movie started with an awful snake exhibition. Plutach tells us that Olympias, mother of Alexander, was fond of snakes as she followed the Orphic doctrines. But this doesn't mean leading us into a zoo. Alexander, as a young prince, is weak and ridiculous. No wonder: he is surrounded by such horrible paintings that we can imagine his nights are obsessed by nightmares. As a matter of fact...he dreams of snakes, always. Please, if you want to give me an historical movie, save me psycho-history...I'd like better seeing Hithcock's PSYCHO instead. If you want to give me an entertaining movie, give me Troy back. Because Alexander is intolerably boring. Keep Hopkins and Plummer silent, please, and give me some interesting images. But the worst of all was the battle against Poros, with all that red...lysergic acid? I would save Jared Leto, who at least is not laughable, despite of his marked make up (why nobody told Stone that Greek homosexuals HATED make-up?). But from a global point of view, the movie is a complete fiasco."
"tothorsi2","10","67","130","27 December 2004"," Fortune favours the bold... filmmakers
","I went to the theater to see Alexander without having read any critiques beforehand. It is only now that I bothered to go through a bunch of reviews, most of which were so bad that blood froze in my veins.<br/><br/>Why did so many people hate this movie? <br/><br/>Alexander is an intelligent movie made for intelligent people. Those who expect straightforward answers from this movie will be disappointed. To figure out the message of this movie, you have to contribute. You have to live, fight, fear and feel with the characters. Stone makes no spoon feeding. It is only the viewer himself who can find the answers, which are there in the script and on the faces of the actors.<br/><br/>Why did Alexander chase the end of the world? Why was he pushing ever so hard? <br/><br/>One of the key moments of the movie is the Babylon balcony scene where Hephaiston and Alexander have a beautiful dialog. Hephaiston asks Alexander why he is chasing his dream to the East. Alexander's answer is: ""Who knows these things?"". At the same time Alexander asks his lover: ""Am I weak or divine?"" No straightforward reply comes from Hephaiston.<br/><br/>Alexander became a king at 19. He could never be himself. He was blessed and cursed with a mother who had the greatest love and passion for her son and, more importantly, for power. He was made a king way too soon. He was offered the world and had NO CHOICE but to take it. He tried his best in doing so, because he was always trained to be the best. He was the greatest king, the ruler of what was then the known world. <br/><br/>Yet, he was a young boy, who mourned his father and was scared. Yes scared, look at Colin's eyes, for example when he rides against the elephant in India! He didn't have a home. He didn't have love in his life, at least the kind of love that means home to a man. He was looking for a place he could call home and looking for his own self. He was a man of dreams and visions, because he had to be. <br/><br/>Alexander was a complex personality, this you cannot depict in black and white. If a director chooses to do so, then the result may, at best, be a good movie like Troy or King Arthur. But Stone opted for the hard way and made an unforgettable movie.<br/><br/>Another thing to say for Stone is that he does not pretend that he knows the full story. He does not make the mistake of wanting the impossible. He stays realistic, and makes a realistic movie. For instance, we never know why Alexander married Roxane. The script presents us with three options and we are free to choose. And we HAVE to choose. If you don't choose, you're left with confusion and you think that the script is a mess. It isn't. It's just smarter than you. And it is careful and balanced.<br/><br/>Stone is undoubtedly a top-class director, who wrote a smart script. He had the talent of making the best actors out of actors with potential. I never knew that Lara Croft and Batman could play!? Sorry Colin, never seen you before in anything. Colin, Angelina, Val; all of them were breath-taking. There is hard work behind their performance; both physically and mentally. Making Alexander was a bold and successful attempt.<br/><br/>If you let yourself be captured, the movie will love you and will give you so much more you ever thought a movie could. Then, and only then, will Alexander be a movie that stays with you for a long time after you've seen it. The filmmakers have kept their side of the bargain. The rest is up to you; and believe me, it is quite an easy and enjoyable task."

"foolforfilm","Null","33","60","28 November 2004"," Recommended, for a very limited audience
","I can recommend Alexander to anybody who likes El Cid, Khartoum and The Fall of the Roman Empire. I had problems with the movie. Let me count some of the ways. First, Angelina Jolie plays Alexander's mother. Talk about child bride  she's one year older than Colin Farrell, Alexander, in real life. There's (naturally) an incestuous relationship implied. And Alexander's father is Val Kilmer, who's only about 15 years older than Farrell. I don't think boys of that age generally reached puberty in ancient Greece due to a lack of protein.<br/><br/>Second, in the beginning of the movie, Kilmer relates some Greek legends to Alexander the boy. This is glossed over much too quickly; the stories are really interesting and bear on the rest of the movie. They constantly refer to them, but unless you're really knowledgeable, most pass over your head. I guess Oliver Stone considered this only marginally important background. He had to cut something (the film's 3 hours as is) because he had to fit in endless, repetitive, boring homosexual stuff that's probably fictitious. As we know from many movies, all REAL men are as least a little bit gay. (I guess this is my third problem. I'll quit counting.) <br/><br/>Next, in his first manifestation of the king and leader he was to become, little Alex tames a wild horse by, oh my God, whispering to him. Who'd have thunk that in addition to conquering the known world (more later), Alexander invented horse-whispering almost 2500 years before anybody ever heard of it. Was Robert Redford a co-writer? He didn't get screen credit.<br/><br/>Next, while in northeastern Persia on endless pursuit of his arch rival, Darius (who looks like a Hollywood-ized version of some current arch rival of America who will remain nameless), Alexander marries the daughter of some local chieftain. Now you'd think that since they were so specific about where Alexander was when he married her, they'd get some actress who looks vaguely Asian. But no. This one must have been from that little-known tribe of Africans who lived in central Asia circa third century B.C. Naturally, she looked like Alexander's much beloved and hated mother. Oh well, she had a nice pair, so that settles that. On their wedding night, she pulls a knife on him which leads to some rough sex. A little S&M is always necessary. Did I mention she had a weird tattoo on her body? <br/><br/>Too many spectacular scenes (Babylon, most of the battles) look like CGI run amuck. But one involved elephants, so unless you're a real Sabu fan, that's unusual. (By the way, Sabu owned a seafood restaurant in Monterey.) Of course, when Alexander is killed, it's in slow motion. Holy Sam Peckinpah! But like E.T., he doesn't die. He recovers! (Music swells as yet another movie cliché is checked off.) A plus is that the formulaic background music (Vangelis; think Chariots of Fire) and noise often covers a lot of forgettable dialogue that often is unrelated to anything in particular. In fact, there sometimes seemed to be little linkage between one sequence and the next. I don't think we saw an out-of-order print, but you never know. <br/><br/>Of course, it was necessary that lower-cast Greeks have cockney accents. And the fact that I couldn't tell one of Alexander's friends from the other must be my fault. One friend kept showing up over and over again, never said a word, and was never referred to at all. Who was he supposed to be, another one of Alexander's lovers? An early version of Jesus? (Mustn't forget the evangelicals.) <br/><br/>Isn't it a truism that one one-eyed character in a movie is enough? This one has two. You can really tell them apart: one is missing his left eye, the other his right. <br/><br/>They constantly make reference to the ""known"" world, like ""I've conquered the known world."" I find this a little anachronistic, or do you think they knew more than we give them credit for? And Alexander said he wanted to unite Asia and Europe and - holy world brotherhood! He stopped short of reference to the United Nations. (Speaking of geography, the Mediterranean is referred to as the Middle Sea, but on one map it's labeled Mediterranean.) <br/><br/>All in all, not the worst movie I've seen this year  that's Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Come to think of it, Angelina Jolie was in that, too. Maybe there's a message here. And in THAT movie, she wore an eye patch. By George, I think I've got it! <br/><br/>Hey, nobody smoked a cigarette."

Just for that I felt that this movie is of some worth. I have to admit some of the lines sent chills down my spin, but the movie on the whole was good. Historically this movie could not have been far off. Pertaining to Alexander's death, I liked how the cause was left ambiguis. Those that say that Stone butchered History in making this movie I find to be wrong. Though Alexander might not have been blond, why not by the way, much of what was portrayed went against common belief but true to what we have learned of the great conqueror. I guess summed up, this was a GOOD movie, I enjoyed myself, and was able to immerse myself in Stone's interpretation of the life of a GREAT man."
"atlas_wept","1","17","28","22 September 2005"," Oliver Stone should be imprisoned for creating this film...
","On one hand you can have a film like Troy. On the other hand, you can produce one of the worst films in history and call it ""Alexander""... The only thing worse than making a really bad film, is making a really bad film that lasts three hours...<br/><br/>To be honest, it isn't the fault of the actors. However, the script is patchy and the plot jumps over vast, and important, aspects of the life of Alexander. It appears that the film attempts to make up for this with battle scenes that drag on forever and really aren't that interesting; the time would be better spent giving the viewer a more informative picture of who Alexander really was. And the portrayal of the main character was incredibly weak. It isn't an issue to show his homosexual tendencies, but in general Alexander is portrayed as something of a weakling. I highly doubt that someone as weak and soft as the character portrayed in this film could have conquered the known world.<br/><br/>Otherwise, watch out for the (countless) moments when you'll simply want to throw up because the film is so bad..."
"t_deanna","4","9","13","16 October 2005"," Alexander Minus not Magna
","I watched this film three times with three hopes. The first was that I could do some historical recounting and add to my knowledge of the Macedonian hero and his legend. The second was that I catch parts of the dialog that were hard (to my ear) to understand. The third was to give the film a chance, having been influenced by almost unanimous bad or indifferent reviews before seeing it.<br/><br/>As a film and man of history, Alexander would have been better served by linear story-telling as opposed to retrospectives of his youth through the narrative of his veteran general, Ptolemy (sorry, Anthony Hopkins). Alexander's youth was more gritty than Stone presented. This kid never got dirty, his hair never messed - even after wrestling matches and horse-breaking. The boy Alexander looked uncannily like Oliver Twist, and his peers at court(and Aristotle's pupils) were the same golden haired Anglos out of the Dickens classic. True, the ancient Greeks (pre-Turkish) could be quite blonde, but give them some Hellenic attributes - somehow - beyond tunics and laurel wreaths. Stone went for the idyllic and the result was cutesy.<br/><br/>Then you have the screenplay, which - please - with what they're paying for production - get some really seasoned writers on this - so much of the early dialog was heart-warming Disney-type jibe. There was so much excess verbiage that could have been trimmed and even if Stone did not compromise the overall length, he could have used that time elsewhere and more importantly. Likewise, the soundtrack by Vangelis did not go with this film. So much emotion was lost because of limp background music.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer as Phillip was well chosen as the jovial, bombastic King of Macedon and likable in the role. <br/><br/>When Phillip shows Alexander around an underground cave, describing the exploits of mythological heroes, I could not make out the mosaics - the camera panned to different sections of cave wall with black soot - and to what point? To have actually seen these epic figures would have had more impact on the narrative. This was interspersed with moments of lingering darkness which did nothing but give the camera a break.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was stunning and an appropriate choice for Olympias, but her accent was displaced (as were the heavy Scottish brogues) - a distraction throughout this film. English is the language of Shakespeare, but could'nt they have neutralized the regionalism? ""I, Claudius"" worked perfectly with an entirely English cast.<br/><br/>Stone leaves out Alexander's trip to Siwa (Egypt) where he is confirmed a god. Considering how Olympias went on (and on and on) about his Achilles blood line, this was crucial to the film. Visit some of his earlier battles, Arbela, etc. Show some background that way (some history) instead of this recurrent Ptolemy retrospective out of that Titans movie with Harry Hamlin (that's what this movie sometimes felt like). Having missed some of the more crucial engagements, intrigues and details of Alexander's life, it's off to Gaugamela. <br/><br/>My first thought was, the bird has got to go. An eagle's flight permeated the film from Gaugamela as both a symbol (without prior reference) and for cinematic perspective (a device out of Hitchcock), but cinematography can give us a bird's eye view without the bird. Then later in the film Alexander looks into the sky and wonders where the bird went, thus giving it a character role. The close-ups of a waxen Darius, the Persian king, served no purpose - there was no awe in this recurrent camera perspective. Then they kept tossing around the camera for the battle scene(s), which was brain-rattling. <br/><br/>The city of Babylon, the battle prize, was represented well (by computer graphics) and glorious to behold, but the harem scene (like a beauty contest) was silly. The women were too aggressive and trying really hard to be exotic. Babylon was beautiful, but I also wanted to see Pella (other than court-yards), Susa and other cities of the period.<br/><br/>And so on, into far Persia and India (a mistake), mutiny and madness, until Alexander returns to Babylon years later, hated and plotted against until his death. <br/><br/>What this film taught me about Alexander - he should have listened to his mother."

","I just recently watched Alexander, and it was truly a great film, the scenery and locations were breathtaking, superb costumes! and elaborate sets, good acting from the cast, although the Irish accents weren't that distracting, i had to bring up Angelina Jolie's east European accent, it just sounded a bit wrong for this kind of film. But the whole of the movie was shot beautifully, including Oliver Stone's stylized close ups of the characters was good , even though some American audiences disliked this film, myself and many others left the theater inspired. For the audiences this is a love it or hate it kind of film, if many of you are expecting this to be another Troy you will be sadly disappointed, it's best to see this film not hoping it to be like other sword & sandal epics cause you will understand the nature of this film, + get more enjoyment out of it. overall this film was worth my 10 bucks that's for sure. <br/><br/>Work well done Mr. Stone!"
"BirdyBabe","10","41","77","1 December 2004"," Sadness because of Bad Reviews
","I'm quite saddened to see the negative reviews that surround this film. I am not a history buff, but I have read much on Alexander's life and this movie is not for the uneducated. Oliver Stone employs so much craft to create subtle moments that those who know of Alexander's life would understand. The transitions are fast, yes, but not impossible to follow. If anything, I'd think they'd inspire the audience to figure out more about Alexander and to use their brains and investigate into his life. This is not a movie that spells it out for you--the audience must be an active part and Oliver Stone expects his audience to come prepared. Even if you don't know anything about Alexander, there's no reason not to learn. It's not so confusing that you can't figure it out-just be alert and ready to take part in it. Not your cup of tea? Don't know anything about Alexander? Then don't go see it. But don't attack the film for asking you to use your minds. <br/><br/>I've heard a lot of negative comments about the historical accuracy. Again, I don't know a lot, but the fact of the matter is that any time reality is placed down on paper (as a story, a script, a song), it will be changed from that reality. There is no way you can tell a story without changing it from the exact truth. Events are interpreted different ways for each person, moments in time are held at different levels of importance. Was this Oliver Stone's take on Alexander's life? Yes, indeed it was. But since when did artistic expression have to bend to the will of others? Since when did he have to create a movie that followed his vision in order to please you? Yes, Alexander is a historical figure, but he lived so long ago that every account we have of him has been changed by the person who wrote it down. That's why there are so many different opinions of him--because none of us really know for sure. This is Oliver Stone's opinion of what took place. You don't have to like it, but respect it as being different.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone clearly loves and wishes to cherish the memory of Alexander, as does everyone working on the film. There is so much emotion and love poured into the scenes-Colin Feral himself speaks of how much he loves this movie. This is not a big blockbuster gunning for your money; this is an epic film that presents it take on a life to the best of its ability. The battle scenes are confusing, yes. But battles are confusing-there's no order in such a mêlée. Time jumps around sometimes, yes, but don't we all reminisce about things in our pasts? Thousands of movies have employed such jumps.<br/><br/>Likewise, the homosexuality issue is part of a huge debate. I'm not going into it, because there have been arguments over it since the movie was announced. I would have loved to see Alexander and Hephaistion kiss, but I don't believe Oliver Stone avoided the issue. He wanted to portray their relationship as the purest and deepest love, which is so easily confused with sex. Also, considering the uproar that has happened from what is actually in the film, what would have happened if they had kiss? The reviews and feedback would be only about the homosexuality represented. Nothing else would be focused on, and that wouldn't be fair to the film. The film wasn't about Alexander's sexuality, it was about Alexander. For our sadly homophobic society, one kiss would have made it solely about that issue. <br/><br/>I believe Oliver Stone followed his heart with this film, as did everyone who was a part of it. Money is never wasted on the arts or on someone's artistic vision. I loved this movie, for all that the Irish Accents were amusing and for all that the dialogue could be sometimes dramatic. It's different than how I ever thought of Alexander and his life, but I accept Oliver Stone's take on it, because it's his movie. I respect it and love it, because it is homage to a great man. We should be grateful for the fact that so much love and emotion and heart are still being put into movies, instead of damning it for being different. If you like Alexander, see this movie. See it with an open mind. Hell, don't listen to any reviews. If you've seen the trailer and you want to see it, then see it, no matter what anyone says (myself included). The worst that can happen is that you won't like it, won't like Oliver Stone anymore and will have spent 3 hours watching a movie you didn't like. I think we've all had that experience. But see it anyways if you even had a tiny desire to do so, because in the end, you deserve the right to formulate your own opinions."
"desireeryan","10","50","96","4 January 2005"," An excellent film!
","I have read a lot of bad comments on the movie Alexander, and I find it strange. Of course opinions of movies is subjective to the viewer, but I couldn't believe so many people did not like this film. Anyway, I felt the acting was miraculous! Colin Farrell is Alexander, I think he proved that. I think Oliver Stone depicted the relationship between Hephaistion and Alexander tastefully. I've heard a few people say the film was nothing short of gay porn! Were they watching the same movie I was. That I can remember, Alexander only kisses one male in the film and the rest of the Bisexuality was depicted with glances and insinuations of relationships. This is the part that I feel Oliver Stone depicted tastefully. Angelina Jolie did an excellent job as Olympias. THe only complaint that I have about this film is that the narrating jumped around a lot and I feel that some of the scenes could have been kept in sequence to tell the story more clearly. But other than that, I thought it was brilliant."
"spiritcombust","10","45","86","29 November 2004"," Mind-blowing.
","When I first went to see Alexander, I was extraordinarily anxious. After all, this film had the potential to be mind-blowing or mind-numbing. I was eager to find out which it would be. At four minutes short of three hours, this film did not disappoint me. It was nothing short of incredible.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone, who directed and wrote the script for the film, did a superb job recreating the life of Alexander the Great. With so much material to cover--Alexander's noteworthy childhood, his tutelege with Aristotle, his conquering most of the known world--the director chose the most important points and highlighted them. Instead of filling us with three hours' worth of limb-hacking and gut-spewing, Stone built Alexander into a man with dreams, with weaknesses, into someone who was human, despite the legend surrounding him. The world of the ancients was recreated with tact, and all the gods, the rituals, the wars and the palaces were established to draw the viewer into Alexander's world. The picture abounded with colorful characters and settings.<br/><br/>The most important people in Alexander's life--his crazed mother Olympias, his overbearing father, Philip, his best friend and lover Hephaestion--were cast well. There were relationships between the minor characters--the rivalry between Olympias and Philip, the affection between Kleitos and Philip--that made ther story real and believable. One could see how each member of Alexander's family and close circle impacted him, and how he felt about each of them. Most satisfying, however, were the passionate relationships Alexander had with his mother and Hephaestion. Although Olympias only appears a couple of times in the film, most notably the beginning, her love for her son, her hatred for her husband, and her greed are all palpable. Alexander's mingled love and resentment makes one pity him. Hephaestion, although a more constant presence in the film, is not prominent but for a few brief scenes. In these scenes, his conversations with Alexander portray his love and loyalty, and he--who knows Alexander best of all--delivers several important points that bring the viewer to a better understanding of Alexander. On the other hand, the viewer can also see clearly Alexander's dependence on his friend, his gratitude and his caring. Two specific conversations build such emotion that I felt close to tears. The sexual undertones between the two men may disturb some, but the sexuality isn't forced, it is very obvious that what Alexander and Hephaestion have is a deep, undying love, and sex is not necessarily a part of their relationship. However, Hephaestion does wear eyeliner, and it sort of make one wish that they would just get it on. <br/><br/>The minor characters, Alexander's generals, and his friends, his soldiers, who may not have many lines in the film, perhaps portray most clearly who Alexander really was. Their admiration of him, their desire to make him happy and proud, and in some cases, the greed that causes them to hurt him, all show how Alexander was different from all other kings of the age. He felt the pain his people felt, and desired most of all to have one world, and one empire, where all would have peace and opportunity. Some resented this, and the racism of some of the characters--most obviously Cassander and Cleitus--makes the world more realistic. But for the most part, he inspired and undying loyalty in all he lead, and it is the fact that he so concerns himself with the common people, and allows himself to be so affected by them, that sets him apart.<br/><br/>The plot, interspersed by narration from an old Ptolemy, moves quickly, and touches on the greatest victories and losses of Alexander's life. The battle of Gaugamela, the conquest of the Persian empire, the revolt of his troops in India, all were emotional scenes that underscored the humanity of Alexander. Stone wastes no time on lengthy battle sequences--although there are violent battle scenes, he does not show all of Alexander's conquests--and instead shows the politics behind Alexander's reign. His generals' names are memorable to even the most uneducated viewer, because each general has a unique perspective about Alexander. Their betrayals, of which there are a few, make some of the most heart-breaking moments in the film.<br/><br/>My only regret is the short time Stone spends depicting Hephaestion's death and Alexander's reaction to it. While elsewhere in the film their friendship and love is well-shown, some of the most telling things about their relationship were in the way Alexander memorialized him after his death. Perhaps the large battle sequence in India could have been shortened to make room for Alexander's grief over his friend. After all, Hephaestion's funeral was the most grandiose in the entire history of the world, and Alexander spent close to thirteen thousand talents on the events. He sheared off all of his hair when the custom was one lock, and spent a day and a night lying on the body, until he was forcibly removed. The movie skips over most of this, and only allows a short fit of rage in which Alexander almost strangles his wife, thinking she has poisoned him. It then quickly moves on to Alexander's own death, and the controversy surrounding that. I regret the loss of such faithful and touching moments, and think that Colin Ferrel and Jared Leto could have had one of the best ""NOOOOOOOOOO!"" scenes in film.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was engrossing and touching, with enough action for the men and enough romance for the women. I myself was enthralled with the passion and anguish that dotted Alexander's life, and appreciated the dedication each of the actors, down to the smallest extra Macedonian soldier, had to their character. Although lengthy, each minute has significance, and I encourage everyone to see it! <br/><br/>Mind-blowing, most definitely."
"samantha_dennett","10","34","63","2 December 2004"," Why I enjoyed it and my friends didn't.
","Alexander is probably going to be one of the more controversial movies of the year, in that most people will either hate it or love it. It's all a matter of taste. As a drama/historical documentary sort of film, it's almost unparalleled. It's one of the first times I have ever seen a Hollywood film that is unafraid to show the ""TRUE"" elements of that time period. Anyone who is a fan of historical accuracy and is well-versed on the culture and relationships of that period will recognise that love between men was acceptable and is recorded in some of the most famous writings of those times; well, the uncensored versions anyway.<br/><br/>I ventured into the film actually expecting another one of Hollywoods over-the-top exaggerations (ie, Troy...) but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film actually seemed to portray the way things likely were with out major alterations on well-known facts. Yes, there were parts that were slow in the film, but the development of the characters and their motivations were thorough and precise. I for one enjoyed it.<br/><br/>However, my friends didn't feel the same. I saw the film with five others. One walked out halfway through because he thought it was boring. One thought the film was generally okay, but a bit slow. The other three were some what icked out by the somewhat ""demonstrative"" homosexual aspects in the film. They didn't personally have anything against it, but I think they were ill-prepared for how blatant it is throughout, even though you never really see anything besides kissing, a few slaps on the butt, and hints of more. I doubt a Hollywood movie has EVER shown male-love quite in this way. I think many people will find it shocking to say the least. But again, if one is well-versed on that period, enjoys historical accuracy, and is fairly open-minded... I think that this can be overlooked.<br/><br/>I'm fairly sure this movie will be a love it-or- hate it one. I personally loved it, and if you enjoy historically accurate films and are fairly open-minded, then I recommend at least watching this to know whether you enjoy it or not. Three hours of your time (and probably a bathroom break) and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised... or not. **shrugs** It's all a matter of opinion, now isn't it."
"flingebunt","4","10","15","28 October 2005"," Alexander the confused, lonely and boring
","Fact: Alexander the great set out to conquer the world, and he did. When he found out the world was bigger than he first thought, he wanted to conquer that too. His Macedonian army literally followed him to the ends of the earth and beyond.<br/><br/>I would not follow Colin Farrel's Alexander down the road to the pub for a couple of pints. Sure he had problems, sure he was gay....but that is not what defined him.<br/><br/>He was a warrior who was at the front of the charge, not a king ordering from the back.<br/><br/>This is where the movie fails. It misses the point. It doesn't convince you in any way that this person could have conquered the world and inspired the loyalty of his people for so long and over such treacherous terrain.<br/><br/>There were Greek speaking cities in India 200 years ago and in middle east his name is remembered reverentially.<br/><br/>Basically a waste of time. Worse yet, Oliver Stone obviously doesn't trust or understand CGI, so most of shots of war look outdated and fail to capture the real situation."

It is the story of a neurotic, not of one of the greatest generals of all time.<br/><br/>There are a few great battles, but after awhile they too get boring. What was happening? All you see is the small picture (guys hacking each other up). You don't see Alexander planning, plotting, strategizing, analyzing, etc. He's just another guy hacking away.<br/><br/>He doesn't come across as a great man.<br/><br/>The decision to jump around in history is puzzling. It makes the film hard to follow and disjointed. We don't get a sense of change in him, or in the world, or in his leadership or his generalship.

"johnmack63","1","6","8","13 December 2011"," Epic Disaster
","If Oliver Stone is ever charged with murder and wants to plead the insanity defense, he can use Alexander as Exhibit A. Alexander is a three hour train wreck that may rank as one of the biggest bombs in movie history.<br/><br/>Alexander was one of the greatest military leaders in history and by the age of 32 he had conquered most of the civilized world. None of his military genius or the inner drive that made him the terror of the ancient world, however, is explored in Alexander. Instead, Oliver Stone focuses on Alexander's sexuality and on his insane, snake-handling mother, played by Angelina Jolie, with what sounds like a Transylvanian accent.<br/><br/>Colin Farrel is spectacularly miscast as Alexander. The slightly-built actor sports a ridiculous blond wig, and looks more like a surfer dude who would have a tough time beating Jolie in an arm wrestling contest, than the ruthless conqueror of nations (think Leonardo DiCaprio as Patton). The acting is universally awful and scenes continue endlessly with no apparent point. There are only two battle scenes in the entire movie and both are so confusing it is tough to tell what the hell is happening."

","Possibly one of the worst films I have ever see. Absolute rubbish, a complete mess, backed by horrible acting. This film was a serious miss by Oliver Stone. It seems like its trying to feed of the success of other epics such as Braveheart, Gladiator, maybe even Lord of the Rings. The writers must have thought, "" what hasn't been done as a large scale epic? Alexander the Great!"" Colin Farrell? WHY? Nothing of value in this film. It's common for Hollywood to take a story with deep routes in history, and adapt it, changing the story, perhaps to the horror of historians,but still adapting it successfully into a blockbuster movie. This film was was a miss both as an authentic portrayal, and a historic action movie. I went to an advanced preview of this film, and about twenty minutes before the end, the screen meant black momentarily, and the audience cheered thinking it was over, and instantly made for the exit, when the screen lit up again, most kept on walking out. Occasionally I think what I could have achieved if I didn't spend those three hours watching this film. Absolutely no satisfaction in watching this film. Quiet simply, Alexander(the movie) WAS NOT GREAT!!!! VERY FAR FROM IT!!!"
"herthh","1","6","8","21 September 2008"," Is Hollywood ruled by talentless protégés these days?
","I do not even know where to begin... Such is my deep disappointment with this movie. I suppose that every history buff shares this emotion, and not surprisingly the movie tanked at the box office.<br/><br/>The dialog is very simplistic, barely touching the level of complexity of the unfolding events. For example could you understand why he decided to execute Parmenion? Virtually none of the characters was really introduced, and so numerous of the palace and gathering scenes appear out of sequence, and it is not obvious what and whom they depict. Imagine you would open a 2000-page book randomly here and there, read from it, and try to make sense of such random fragments. This is how I felt while torturing myself through this malaise.<br/><br/>Aside of the unnerving style of jumps back and forth in the time line, the entire Persian campaign of Alexander was compressed to mere one battle with Darius. Not ""Darayas,"" pronounce after me: Dar'yoos. Of course depiction of a battle itself is not an easy cinematic task, and here the makers of the movie showed their real deficits. They failed completely to explain what exactly happened at Gaugamela, and foremost, how it came to Gaugamela. Shaking cam substituted staged scenes with honest stunts, split second snippets were cut together into a visual blur without sense. Bombastic, too loud music, yelling with British/English accent completed this cinematic disaster.<br/><br/>The storyline misses completely the fact that Gaugamela was not the beginning of the struggle with Darius III. It was the climactic battle indeed, yet just one in a row of great battles with the Persians. The first meaningful battle was the one of the Granicus River, 334BC, in which he defeated Persian general Arsames, and so called Darius III himself to the scene.<br/><br/>Many famous events happened in between Granicus and Gaugamela. For example, at Gordium, Alexander untied the presumably unsolvable ""Gordian Knot,"" he defeated Darius in the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, and later on, he commenced the famous siege of Tyre. This event marked the end of Phoenician independence and of over 1000 years of their culture and history as a nation. Do not look for even mentioning of any of these events in this so called ""movie about Alexander."" Do not look for the equally dramatic aftermath of Gaugamela either, foremost for his march on Persepolis and the (in)famous burning of Xerxes palaces and of the city. Do not hope to see his stay in Egypt and spiritual pilgrimage to the desert, the creation of the still existing city of Alexandria and of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which lasted to the equally famous Roman civic war and the death of Cleopatra and Marcus Antonius...<br/><br/>Shall I go on? Movie makers made of him a gay maniac, yelling and screaming, troubled man. In a sense he was troubled, a man of military genius, but lacking a political vision. A man who won everything, did not realized that and pushed his army to an epic, and yet senseless march toward India, caused a great deal of suffering and destruction. I never understood why do we call him The Great? As much as such opinion may vary, do not expect an answer from this movie. As I see it, Macedonians were only a footprint in history. Not long after Alexanders exploits, they were beaten every each time by Romans, and forced finally into becoming a Roman province. End of the game.<br/><br/>Hitchcock, please raise from the grave, show these young Hollywood crowds how to make a good suspense. They all lost their minds and their senses."

","I had heard from many, many people before walking into the theater that this movie was bad, but I figured - hey, maybe there'll be some epic battles I can enjoy if nothing else. There wasn't even that.<br/><br/>NOTE: Be forewarned, I may have given some spoilers away in my blind rage.<br/><br/>To begin, we are given Anthony Hopkins (who I like) as some old man dictating the life of Alexander to a scribe. Luckily for us, he also serves as a History Channel-esque narrator to TELL us what happens when Oliver Stone was too lazy to SHOW us. For instance, instead of SHOWING how Alexander became great by conquering Persia and Egypt, we are given a (terribly shot and edited) battle scene in the middle of the desert, where Alexander all but loses. Directly following, Anthony Hopkins tells us, ""and then Persia was defeated.""<br/><br/>The story doesn't give us much. For me, I got out of it that Alexander was a flamboyant ass who marched an army further and further east until he was defeated in India. What's great about that? Oliver Stone assumes we already KNOW that he's great (he DOES have that surname, he MUST be great), and reminds us by having various characters tell Alex that he's great.<br/><br/>On top of that, the cinematography was abysmal. I mean, doesn't he know that there are other shots in existence other than the over-the-shoulder shot? And in the battle scenes, I guess he decided, like Wolfgang Peterson with ""Troy,"" that it would be really great if no one could see what was happening. The camera was so shaky, I nearly screamed ""USE A FREAKING TRIPOD!!"" in the middle of the theater. Then there were the completely unnecessary shots, wherein some object would hold the center screen for a long period of time, completely at random. Ugh. The photography was either boring, unnecessary or unwatchable, or all of the above.<br/><br/>I have many, many specific instances that I could tear at with rage (such as the super-slow-motion not-quite-death scene), but the main thing that really bugs me is how badly Oliver Stone told this story. I mean, it's Alexander the Great! How can you go wrong?? Well, he definitely did. I've never walked out of a movie before, and I only stopped myself by thinking, ""well, there may be a sweet battle scene at the end."" No such luck - and the movie dragged on and on and ON. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't think I've given my rage enough justice in this review. The point is, don't see it, it sucks, and sucks for three hours."

","They took a thousand people into the desert for two years and had to justify the expense by putting together three hours of footage as a film. Unfortunately Stone used the wrong three hours. Somehow Petersen's Troy was watchable, and even brilliant in places. This was totally awful. Irishmen transplanted to Greece, with no explanation. Peroxide blond hero with dazed expression. Russian mother who is only two years older than himself. One eyed Dad whose motivation is impenetrable, and then who dies off screen. I gave up half way through the battle of Gaugamela. Despite Alex outlining his strategy using models at the beginning, it degenerated into the usual Braveheart / Gladiator style pell mell nonsense. The Macedonian phalanx was successful because of its discipline. Not for taking part in a chaotic mess. When will directors stop following Gibson's free for all style in battle scenes? It is just lazy and stupid. Alexander wouldn't have conquered the block around his own house if he had behaved like that. What came after this I don't know, as I decided not to waste any more time on this rubbish. Is this the same Stone who made JFK and Nixon ? Is he on crack nowadays ?"

","Look at the three ""best"" reviews about Alexander. Each of them received 274 votes. Isn't it a little odd? As I am an University Professor too, I am a little malicious. Colleague Lane Fox has got a lot of pupils: isn't it possible that they gave their votes to the Professor who was consulted in order to write the screenplay of this movie? As regards me, I think that Alexander is an intolerably long and boring school lesson. It is no movie. There is no plot, no emotion, no decent CGI. It looks like an anime. The archaeological reconstruction is terribly bad, in any case definitely worse than in ""Troy"". And the acting is always exaggerated (I would save only Jared Leto). Three stars for good photography and costumes. But from a global point of view, an incredible disappointment. Give me Troy back!"

","It's such a gay movie. They didn't give justice to the role of Alexander the Great! Greek Homosexuality in the olden times was a reality but they kept rubbing-it-in. Each scene had to depict men kissing and splitting or male genitals showing. A waste of time and money. Troy or Kingdom of Heaven was a far more impressing film than this. The fight scenes were good but the strength of the main character wasn't shown in Alexander. The facial expressions of Alexander never commanded authority and confidence. It is full of self-pity, remorse and pain. In general, i found this movie a flop and something not worth seeing."
"JHJM27","10","30","56","29 November 2004"," Excellent, like an undervalued stock.
","So, I have been warned to expect some sort of ""subtle homoerotic (however way homoeroticism can be perceived as 'subtle') scenes"" even before I crossed the newly polished cinema threshold. See, I read the papers and I know history, unlike explosive characters out there who bloody expected Alexander to be straight. Simply, I had an idea what was going to be shown before me.<br/><br/>I entered that frosty theatre, bound to be coated in hard icicles since I forgot my sweater, intrigued by the well-known story of the film, driven by being a Farrell Fanatic, and anxious to see how Oliver Stone made this movie - liking his previous works. And I sat down. <br/><br/>Dear God.<br/><br/>What I think brought distraught to many, is the fact that Alexander's sexuality was played out in the open field. Silly, the bloody people of this earth. They were too held up in the controversy. <br/><br/>Someone even mentioned that the movie made him/her see that men are better lovers and women are just for legal purposes - DUDE, that was 2,500 years ago. MAYBE, just MAYBE, those were the ways of their royalties.<br/><br/>PLEASE, people, find it in you to consider the time gap. 323 B.C., OK?<br/><br/>And funnier is the outrage that seemed to overflow within individuals concerning legalizing gay marriages of today. Seriously. Alexander lived way before Christ was conceived. Alexander liked women and men, not too much of a tumultuous reality in their times, now was it? <br/><br/>In short, for the 'sex scandals', SO WHAT?!<br/><br/>Really, the movie, as I realized it, was meant to portray the determination Alexander had in him to reach the end of the world. He wanted something and he went all those miles, literally, to go and get it. That's what Oliver Stone wanted to get thru. Though he seemed to have failed congregating the audience to follow his focus having put in the same picture Alexander's sexual preferences - or people are just plain stupid.<br/><br/>But then again, I don't think it was too much of an issue, this sexuality of his. Again, so what? Open your minds, his sexual escapades were not the only reasons this movie was rendered hence it must not be the only thing you're allowed to notice (and bash).<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the acting. To be fair, and as a learning actress myself, the acting was over done but fine enough. The actors had been able to convey their emotions and I'm sure, I felt the love and fear during the war scenes. Colin Farrell and Jared Leto proved themselves, as Angelina Jolie made herself into a whole of perfection. <br/><br/>And the different accents. Yes, that was off-putting, but the acting made up for it - ADMIT IT, you conservative, over-underestimating, biased flock of human degradation.<br/><br/>Behind the scandals, this film is actually laudable. It's a flow of the significance of why and how Alexander was able to almost conquer the world. And I think, in the bottom of everything, that was what should have been made to matter. And somehow, Stone was able to make us understand but in such a way that confounded the other masses."
"nerissarbfan","10","37","72","5 December 2004"," Best Movie I've ever seen (WARNING: may include spoilers)
","I went into the theatre expecting to be disappointed-everyone I know said that 'Alexander' had absolutely sucked. However, when the movie ended, I was just simply amazed! With immense respect of ancient history, I found 'Alexander' to be mesmerizing. The movie struck me as more of a documentary (narrated by Anthony Hopkin's Old Ptolemy) and I found it refreshing to finally see a movie that was different from all the regular, fast-pace, typical action-packed movies (such as Lord Of The Rings, Troy, etc.). The average human walking into the theater expecting to see a typical action-packed movie will be disappointed. This movie is not for the weak-minded! It had more dialogue than action-parts, which many people would not approve. I also thought it was more realistic, since real life DOES have more talking than action. To fully appreciate this movie to the maximum extent possible, you must walk into the theater with an open mind, an adequate size of patience, and an ability to listen and understand. <br/><br/>The movie brilliantly delves deep into Alexander (played by Colin Farrell)'s mind, figuring out just why Alexander was so driven to rule the world. Some suggest he did it because he felt he needed to run as far away as possible from his believed-to-be-evil 'sorceress' mother Olympias (played by a very beautiful Angelina Jolie). Others say that Alexander really wanted to unify all of the people on the earth. Either way, this movie explores almost every option of 'why he did it' which made it a very emotionally deep film.<br/><br/>One part of this movie which many Americans find to be offensive is the bisexuality. I, for one, found it refreshing to see something DIFFERENT for a change. Bisexuality DID exist in ancient history-yet most historical movies leave it out, which made 'Alexander' much more realistic to me. Alexander's relationship with Hephaistion was also very sweet and good-willed. After watching this movie, many people got the bisexuality confused with the real fact- that Alexander and Hephaistion's relationship was not about sex, but about the deep true love and respect men can have for each other. And for Pete's sake... it was nice to see a male dancer for once, jeez! <br/><br/>On a final note, the acting, set-design, scenery, special effects, and pretty much everything else was top-notch. The battle scenes were so realistic it was if you were actually there! I thought Colin Farrell's portrayal of Alexander far surpassed that of Brad Pitt's Achilles in Troy. Farrell was able to act out Alexander's emotions beautifully! Val Kilmer (Philip, Alexander's father), Angelina Jolie (Olympias), Jared Leto (Hephaistion), Rosario Dawson (Roxane) and Anthony Hopkins (Ptolemy) really made 'Alexander' unforgettable. The scenery was breathtaking along with the set-design and costumes. Also, the dialogue was well crafted and not rushed. This is a movie I will remember forever!"

","well, i just saw this movie and i can honestly say that even though the script was disappointing, many actors excelled in the movie. Anthony hopkins being the narrator gives you a sense of presence and understanding the movie better for younger viewers. Angelina Jolie ( which i never respected as a good actor) really blew my mind on this movie. Colin Farrel, another chick magnet like brad pitt in troy which bring money to the box office did a great job in this movie and i was simply impressed. Oliver Stone gave the chance to new actors, and others which weren't known much; just like Peter Jackson did in the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"". All the characters are developed well and they all have different personalities, which brings a good variety. I was impressed even more by Clitus and craterus.I know its history, but i think that Ptolemy wasn't the guy for the job. Val Kilmer which i thought was a 'has been' by now came back in Alexander and also did a good job. Many metaphorical moments in the movie with some flashbacks like the ones used in Hero.It could had been a great movie , and Oscar sweeper, But the script needed a much better effort than the one that was given.It had great potential, great actors, great director but a bad script. Not many people want to watch a 3 hour long movie with a bad script, thats why i conclude that it was all a 50/50 between people who liked it and people who didn't like it. Colin Farrel should be nominated at least for his effort for the Oscars, also Angelina Jolie should deserve a Oscar for her performance in the movie, though i think meryl streep from 'the manchurian candidate' will win it. I give it a 7/10 instead of 5 because the battles, the effects and the character development and performance were mind blowing. 7/10 it is."

","I thought Alexander was a great movie, a little long, but it was tolerable. It was nice to finally see a movie that explained a true part of history. I encourage everyone to see the movie for themselves, especially if they are into history or enjoy war movies. Angelina Jolie starred once again and gave a outstanding portrayal of Alexander's mother. Like all Oliver Stone movies, Alexander was long, but it was definitely worth seeing. Many people in theater I was at clapped at the end. Colin Farrell really impressed me with his portrayal of Alexander, especially because it was such a different and unique role for him.

"three_am","9","34","66","2 December 2004"," review of Alexander - 3 out of 3
","I liked this movie a lot. In fact I am still thinking about it after watching it for the second time last night. So, in analyzing why I really liked this movie that all the critics seems to be bashing I've come to these conclusions:<br/><br/>The acting was spot-on. Colin Farrell did a good job. He looked great! He is one sexy man with a sexy voice. He is my new favorite male actor. He should at least get an Oscar nomination. I was impressed with his skills as an actor. He portrayed a man of history that accomplished many feats. Needless to say, I'm convinced Alexander was a conflicted macedonian. Angelina Jolie was gorgeous in this movie. She did a good job despite the strange slavic sounding accent. I would like to see her in a more villainous role. Mr. Kilmer had an interesting role that he did well in. He did a good job portraying a 3 dimensional character.<br/><br/>I caught all the symbolism the second time around and appreciated the angles in which we saw the battle scenes, the lighting variances, etc. I was impressed with Babylon. The scenery in Babylon has shifted my view of wicked biblical Babylon from dirty, haggard, open space image to splendid sprawling city with tall buildings, which made more sense when the Bible always referred to Babylon as a city. The eye candy was splendid. The array of accents used by Alexander's generals, mom, dad, wife was interesting to hear but then that also makes sense since everyone represented more than one race. Perhaps it is far fetched to hear all the macedons and greeks sounding UK, but does that mean they couldn't find enough arabs or greeks to play critical roles? Probably yeah. <br/><br/>I don't understand all the bad reviews this movie is getting. Oliver Stone's perception and representation of Alexander as the man and understanding the horrible, cruel and wonderful things he did is interesting, intelligent - something I can relate to. <br/><br/>Boycott critics. Watch for yourself. <br/><br/>I give this movie 3 out of 3 stars. I'll probably buy it on DVD."
"directme","Null","21","38","5 December 2004"," Ocscar worthy
","Oliver Stone's attempt to give a realistic rendering of Alexander the Great's life necessitated a realistic rendering of his times as well, and the fact is, things were different then. Both death and sex were considered merely parts of everyday existence, unencumbered by modern Christian-dominated civilization's moral considerations. (This was brought home to me personally when I saw the paintings on the walls of homes in Pompeii. By modern standards, the images were pornographic, containing scenes both bisexual and heterosexual, yet they adorned the main living areas of the finest houses. Clearly those people had no more consideratins about sexuality than farming or hunting. It was just another aspect of being alive.) The Greeks of the 4th century BC apparently felt the same way, and Alexander was simply a product of his times in this regard, no more or less. That he was bisexual is incidental. Who he connected with, and why, is far more signifigant in the telling of his tale, and to my mind Stone did an excellent job of separating the important from the unimportant here. Of course, the on-screen violence was graphic, as befitted the violent nature of those times, and there was simply too much of it in Alexander's life to show it all, but I think Stone put a human face on a larger than life persona in an admirable way and successfully avoided many of the excesses a film of this magnitude would easily be prone to. ""Alexander"" is the height of artistic direction in my view."
"CindyH","3","7","10","30 November 2007"," The Howard the Duck of the New Millennium
","Despite the overwhelming bad critical reviews, I thought I'd watch this movie. I'm not one to agree with what critics have to say, as I've enjoyed many a movie that they haven't. However they are on the mark with this one.<br/><br/>The first problem I have with this film is the casting. Just because Jolie lends a pretty face and is probably the only actor in the movie who played her part well, doesn't mean that she still fit into the part. The fact that she's only one year older than her on screen ""son"" is a major problem. She should have never made it to the screen as Olympias. On the other hand, she is the one person in the film that seemed to have any real passion on the screen. She did very well, though she was the wrong choice. As for the others, a blond Colin Farrell is just wrong in any film, a tired - and overly verbal - Anthony Hopkins is an incredible disappointment and Val Kilmer left no lasting impression at all.<br/><br/>Next we move on to the writing. The infinite, and so very dragging, dialog is just too much to try and sit through. Seconds began to tick by like minutes and minutes like hours. Most of the dialog throughout the film could have safely been edited out, without losing the direction the film was going. The extensive Braveheart-ish freedom speech, I'm sure, was a bore for those soldiers to have to sit through. Braveheart did it amazingly well and now everyone wants to do it. Unfortunately only Braveheart is capable of such a good thing.<br/><br/>The direction of the film (and I don't mean the point of it this time) was severely lacking. This is evidenced by the horrible casting, the writing and all other aspects of the film. Take the cinematography for example. This was a perfect opportunity to capture the incredible beauty of the spacious and exotic landscapes, in ways not ever seen before. Instead we are treated to photographic shots that I can do with my old 110 camera. The landscape subjects were good choices, but badly done.<br/><br/>Then there is the homosexuality that is badly portrayed. This subject is still in it's infancy on screen for many viewers, but it can Â– and has been - done respectfully and tastefully. In this instance however, it fails on several points. To say that it was markedly pretentious and overly melodramatic is putting it lightly. Were I a homosexual, I would find it personally offensive.<br/><br/>As for it's historical value, that is not something I can determine easily. I'm no scholar of Alexander and his time period. For example I'm well aware of the frequency of homosexuality in ancient Greece, but I am curious as to how much conjecture this film presents to us when it comes to Alexander's feelings. I prefer films that stick to the facts and not films that try to appeal to today's political ideas. HBO's Rome is a good example of this.<br/><br/>There was one thing though, on this very point, that I was pleased about. I was delighted with the inclusion of the near mystical story of Bucephalus, Alexander's beloved horse. On the other hand, I was disappointed in the follow up of that story. We get to see how Bucephalus came to Alexander (probably the best scene in the film), we see him riding him throughout the film, then... nothing. A little display of affection between the two here and there was warranted, but unfortunately was not provided.<br/><br/>I also liked the costume designs. Again, I don't know how historically accurate they are, but the message was clear and well done. That is except for Val Kilmer's polyester sheepskin rug he wore over his clothing. Had it looked more like real fur, it would have been completely acceptable, but I had a hard time believing it was.<br/><br/>All in all, and I'm very sad to say this, but this movie was a real time waster. It could've been cut to about forty-five minutes and it would've done well. I wouldn't suggest you watch it, unless you are like me and are curious.<br/><br/>I give it one star for the idea of a film about Alexander, one star for Jolie's performance and one star for the beginning of the Bucephalus story. That's all I can give it, which is sad to be sure."

I don't think so. And well, I could have overlooked all those facts if it wasn't because you can just remark a couple of scenes (the war ones) and the excellent photography out of the 3 hours of the movie.<br/><br/>""Alexander"" is a slow movie, superficial and boring, that contributes with nothing to the figure of Alexander the Great (looks more like a caricature of that man).

It wasn't epic enough to satisfy LOTR fans and it wasn't action packed. The love story was kinda limited to some smiles between characters. Jared Leto hugged Farrell more times than he spoke in the movie. It wasn't that anyone did a bad job acting, the story was just bland.

I like some pretty crappy movies and can tolerate things if they are just a lil fun but i was staring at the timer on my DVD player waiting for it to be over. They didn't even have to make Alexander likable, he just came off as having no personality AT ALL, and every time his people wanted a reason from him why they weren't going home he never really gave any answers.

","I'm sitting here still astounded at the critical and audience reaction that this film has suffered. The film is just flat out great. Especially compared to recent sword and sandal epic Troy. Stone's Alexander goes on an entirely different route an overly realistic portrayal of a confused young man manipulated by the people around him and seduced by the power in front of him. The film's excessively large 150 million dollar budget could have been taken down to a mere five million to tell the intimate and personal story of it's title character. Just as confused, direction less and lost as the film seems it represent it's title character to the core. Hollywood took a big gamble on this one the film stands as a true work of art especially with all the gay undertones that are important and emotionally relevant to telling the story. There are many reasons why people will have a problem with this film. Narrow minded unintelligent people. And others just may find it somewhat drawn out or boring but every single scene is necessary so that you may feel it's emotional impact. Angelina Jolie gives a surprisingly reassuring performance as Alexander's manipulative mother and gives us reassurance of why she took home the Oscar that night. Jared Leto and Collin Farell make the hottest gay couple of the year sporting killer bods and amazing tear inducing acting. But the film fares less than perfect. Although quite an accomplished, original and thought provoking film it also sports a lame score and some slightly corny dialogue that induced slight laughing amongst the audience. But besides a few moments of okness the film overall represents a huge cinematic overhaul coming our way. One of intelligence and desperation. Of Heart and passion. Wheather Alexander scores big or flops(which it will most likely do) it will inspire many members of it's true target audience to excel in life."

","I like history very much and I think that Alexander is definitely one of the most intriguing historical persons. He ruled the entire known world and he was so young when he died (33) that it's impossible for us to understand how did he conquered everything and yet remain undefeated in battle. Stone's Alexander is boring. And the question is: how did Stone succeeded to make such a boring movie from such interesting character? I will give you as much answers as I can.<br/><br/>Casting. It is quite amazing how none of the actors managed to fit his/her role.<br/><br/>Directing. Stone is great director but he's lost in this kind of movie. Stone's ""Platoon"" is one of the best movies but after ""Alexander"" and ""World Trade Center"" I'm asking myself what is he doing? Other director is required for this movie.<br/><br/>Music. Music is good but why we are listening it while the fight is taking place? At first major battle music takes place as priority and real sounds of battle are lost. Big minus.<br/><br/>Length. The entire movie is so long. It just goes on and on. I don't mind sitting and watching something good for three hours but this isn't that case.<br/><br/>Narrator. Stone uses narrator to tell us the whole story and his narrator is Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins). If Stone didn't use the narrator the whole movie would be faster and some boring parts would be cut out.<br/><br/>Fighting scenes. All battle scenes aren't impressive and this film is called spectacular. Spectacular for what? In what part? In this kind of movies spectacle is granted by big fighting scenes. But there are many elements required to make good fight scene. One of them is leading actor.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell. Stone's first choice was Russell Crowe. Crowe said no and then Farrell got the role. From Crowe to Farrell. That's a large step. Crowe's strength and appearance vs. Farrell's weak and fragile look. Alexander was strong individual whose strength was his main plus. Do Crowe and Farrell look the same to you? <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie. Why oh why? She's Olympias, you know the mother of Alexander (Farrell). But when I last checked Farrell had 31 and Jolie 32. Possible?<br/><br/>Mistakes. I don't even want to talk about this part. There are so many mistakes. From years to changing scars on actors from one scene to another. <br/><br/>Accent and language. Alexander is speaking English? Oh well Stone is not Mel Gibson (""Passion"",""Apocalypto"") but why his actors are changing accents? Olympias sounds like European in some scenes and Alexander has British accent. <br/><br/>It's enough. I'm done, I don't want to think about this movie any more.

"Agent__Smith","4","8","12","24 February 2005"," A mess of a film...too bad, because it could have been so much better
","The latest effort from Oliver Stone - an epic film biography of one of history's greatest figures, Alexander the Great - held much promise prior to its release. Finally, an epic history, as told by an epic filmmaker.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, with its release - and subsequent departure from U.S. theaters just five weeks later - ""Alexander"" failed to live up to its lofty expectations. My (honestly) unbiased opinion: It was a mess, and I can see why it faded so quickly.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that I maintained an open mind going into the film - prepared to accept whatever depictions of homosexuality were depicted. That was neither my motive for going to the film, nor my source of disappointment in it.<br/><br/>Secondly, I am not a Stone-basher. Like most directors ... well, like most highly-acclaimed directors anyway... he has shown streaks of brilliance (""Nixon,"" to my mind, is his most underrated work in that it actually depicts one of the 20th century's most controversial public figures in a sympathetic light, at once tragic and touching) as well as the occasional streak of over-importance (yes, I was one of those people who found ""JFK"" overbearing and too pretentious). I've even congratulated him for his occasional forays into blatantly controversial topics, especially when they carry such a satiric relevance to modern society (""Natural Born Killers"" comes to mind).<br/><br/>Thus, it was with great disappointment that I exited the theater having watched the mess that was ""Alexander."" I really wanted to like this film and I guess that was why I was so disappointed with it - if anything, perhaps my expectations were too high.<br/><br/>My chief disappointments were as follows:<br/><br/>1) Dialogue. There was entirely too much narration; even for an exceptional vocal talent like Anthony Hopkins. Good films explain themselves through implied or indirect action and/or dialog - those which resort to an inordinate amount of narration or title screens are making up for those deficiencies. Also, what actual dialog there was was extremely superficial - aside from Alexander himself, there seemed to be little or no character development amongst the central figures of this film (meaning: I had little or no interest in the fates of any of these characters by the end of the film - other than that of the actual historic record, of course).<br/><br/>2) Psudo-accents. The polyglot of accents employed was mind-boggling - from Alexander's (read: Farrell's) Irish brogue (?!?), to Val Kilmer's bland American as Philip, to Angelina Jolie's ""Natascha"" (a la Boris & Natascha of Rocky & Bulwinkle fame) impersonation - and everything in between, including the occasional ""Scottish"" hoplite, of all things. For our international readers here, I would think this would be the most upsetting to you - it is merely the latest ""Hollywoodization,"" depicting foreign-speaking peoples by using broken-English or, primarily, British actors. This is one area where I think Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" had it right - I would much rather hear a foreign tongue being spoken on film and read subtitles than watch a dubbed or oddly-accented film like this. Anything else, to me, is an insult to my intelligence.<br/><br/>3) Plot. Not that I'm opposed to the occasional cleverly-constructed non-linear plot line in film -- David Lynch remains one of the most brilliant directors of all time -- but when the film in question is a large-scale historical epic like this, I appreciate following the progression of the plot along its actual historical timeline. Without giving away too many spoilers here, by the time in ""Alexander"" where we learn - finally - what happened to his father, it is way too late in the film to even care that it happened.<br/><br/>4) Action/battle sequences. OK - for a big, epic historical film like ""Alexander,"" this should be the bread-and-butter of the story - the icing on the cake, if you will. Instead, we're left here with only two big epic battle scenes....TWO - out of the multitude of dramatic, epic battles and campaigns waged by Alexander during his reign - and this in a nearly 3-hour film! Of the two battles depicted, the first, Gaugemela, employed so much CGI that it looked more like a computer game - really, I enjoyed the History Channel's recent ""Decisive Battles"" series more than this scene. And the other battle scene - where the Macedonians are fighting the Indians - had entirely too many close-ups and quick cutaways to even follow the action. Not to mention the climactic scene where Alexander encounters the war elephants - I nearly laughed out loud when Stone kept cutting back and forth between the elephant and Farrell's ever-widening eyes! It reminded me of the scene in Monty Python's Holy Grail, where the castle guard keeps watching in the distance for the approaching knight...watching...watching...until the final cutaway when the knight has already stabbed the guard and is on his way into the castle.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I found much of this film to be indefensible, if not unwatchable. Not to say that it didn't have any redeeming qualities -- I thought the use of Vangelis for the soundtrack was both brilliant and appropriate (Vangelis is Greek); and the recreation of ancient Babylon was almost breathtaking in its beauty - one example of where the CGI actually worked in this film.<br/><br/>But, in general, it seemed as though an awful lot of exceptional actors were wasted and/or mis-directed in this film - including, quite possibly, one of Colin Farrell's poorest efforts.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 out of 10."
"kerrydemank","10","28","54","13 January 2005"," About the accents:
","About the accents:<br/><br/>I think you really have to be a genius like Mr. Stone to make the dialogue with so many accents like in Alexander. <br/><br/>To be honest, when I see the trailer when Alexander says: ""Conquer your fear, and I promise you will conquer death,"" I said to myself, Oh--- no, yet again another so-called historical epic and how can I be convinced to see a King/Hero of 2300 years ago to encourage his soldiers in modern English. (Didn't notice the Irish English yet.) But yet you can't let the movie to be played in ancient Greek or other period languages. (It has been already floppy enough, what do you expect it will do in a language almost every people need to read the sub-titles!!??)<br/><br/>Here comes the genius way of Mr. Stone of handling the situation: - He let people conduct the dialogue in different accents compared to the Standard English as the characters would have been actually speaking Greek (or other languages) according to their origin compared with classic ancient Greek. <br/><br/>The Macedonians weren't at the center of Greek civilization. In this way, don't you think it is really clever to hear them speaking English with an Irish accent? (Compared Ireland to England/America as Macedonia to Spartan/Athens.) What a thoughtful approach!!! Audience more careful would have noticed also that the Athenians in the movie speak with quite an American accent and other soldiers groups have their comparable accents, too. The Persians are none English native speakers. Aristotle speaks standard English and Olympus' strange accents is just magnificent to emphasize she was considered ""Barbarian"" by Philipus. Anyway, by hearing these different accents, one realizes how multi-nation Alexander's empire was. <br/><br/>The one who criticizes the accents fails to see the true meaning of this revolutionary approach of film dialogue.<br/><br/>The one who finds it difficult to catch up please be patient and realize there are more than just Americans and English who speaks English. And we shall always be respectful to other people's accent by trying to understand it instead of rejecting it.<br/><br/>The one who doesn't like it please take it this way: Imagine the movie was originally made in ancient Greece and was dubbed into English for us to understand it better. In order to keep the authenticity of the dialogue and considering character's origin, Mr. Stone did us a favour by adapting them with different accents."

","wow am I amazed at the level of hatred for this film....<br/><br/>this is a great film and forceful dramatic examination of Alexander and his philosophy, leadership, passion, and amazing grasp of what was possible in the world....<br/><br/>it is a major intellectual failure for anyone to interpret it as a: <br/><br/>historical documentary: the two main battles of the film are composites of events in Persia and India and as such do not convey accurate detail of a singular event... the backdrop of the Alexandria Pharos (lighthouse) likewise is a simple piece to represent the fantastic world that Alexander made possible... if you want scientific examinations of history, watch the History Channel<br/><br/>a statement on homosexuality: Alexander's bisexuality has ample historical evidence, was common in his contemporaries, and as such is dramatized in the movie in completely reasonable fashion.. it is not any type of a statement, if you interpret it as such you are overreaching<br/><br/>a statement about Tyrannical aims: history suggests that Alexander wanted to unite the world, was conflicted about his place in it, and a whole bunch other stuff, some of which referred to in the film.. attempts to extrapolate that into comparisons to Caligula, Hitler, etc. totally miss the huge evidence of Alexander's planning to unify the world, expand learning and trade, and to be happy in the 'doing' of things <br/><br/>there is much more but you get the idea....<br/><br/>this film delivers an interpretation of Alexander's dream as a dream...<br/><br/>the audience can choose to complain and moan about the correctness of a battle or the characterization of homosexuality...<br/><br/>but the reality is, it's an inspiring tale of one of the world's greatest people"
"peteurb-1","3","9","14","8 September 2005"," Awful
","I had my doubts about this movie but rented it anyway. I should have followed my first instincts. I can't believe Oliver Stone was involved in this. After reading some of the inconsistencies, Stone who is usually a stickler for detail sure did blow it on this one. The battle scenes were poorly choreographed, poorly filmed and it was almost impossible to tell which side was winning and which side was losing. The fact that they had the various parts of the armies in different dress didn't help. The aerial views of the battles were obviously shown very distant to save money on how many extras they had to pay. The Irish accents didn't help the credibility. Finally I think it was a real waste of talent (not Colin playing Alexander). I don't know how much they paid Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins, but it wasn't enough to have such a stain on their resumes. Lastly Colin Farrell cast as Alexander Irish accent and all, was a colossal bit of miscasting. Good luck to those who ignore my review."

","The battles scenes made the movie bearable, but it isn't anything people haven't seen before. If you want to watch a movie with battles in them I suggest Braveheart, Gladiator, or Return of the King (which also has a battle with animals very similar to elephants). <br/><br/>If you want to waste a perfectly good three hours of your life go ahead and see Alexander. The story doesn't focus particularly on one point of Alexander's life, but the whole damn thing and it just drags on and on and on. The audience is then bombarded with laughable dialogue (people at the screening were actually laughing at it and thankfully the score was so loud at some points you couldn't even hear what was being said). Several people actually walked out on the free screening. I just opted to take a nap."
"bahrri","1","13","22","5 August 2005"," Missed chance
","I rented this movie on DVD yesterday and, to be honest, i really don't understand why there are so many positive comments in the reviews. I found it badly acted (Colin Farell, Angelina Jolie), badly casted (again Colin Farell is terrible as Alexander), badly filmed (with horrible sceneries) and way too long with too many bad conversations.<br/><br/>It doesn't happen very often that i walk out on a movie but on this one i almost did. I am an archaeologist myself and i can't understand why the historian Robin Lane Fox agreed to this scenario, i guess it must be because of the small cameo he was given. The amount of crying that Alexander does in this movie is astonishing, and the homo-erotic emphasis is over-exaggerated (and i really don't have a problem with homosexuals). If you are expecting a movie about the great leadership of Alexander the Great and his unique achievements on the battlefields don't go see this one. He is presented here as a weak, whining and insecure softy and that's really not a correct way of presenting the facts. I can understand now why the Greeks were not amused by this movie.<br/><br/>All the pretentious name throwing in the movie and selective presenting of facts is useless because 99% of the audience can't relate to it. They just come to see a good action movie. And if you want to know all the details go and read Plutarchus on Alexander. Without it, the movie could have had more action and speed and it could have been a lot shorter in length. Now I felt like a guest at a dinner table with too much bad food and too much bad company and no way to get out.<br/><br/>My advice to Oliver Stone is to go and take some lessons from Ridley Scott on how to make these kind of movies. Both Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven are very nicely done and very enjoyable. Stone was always high in my book because of movies like Platoon and Natural Born Killers but in this case the money could have been spent in a much better way.<br/><br/>I really think this is a missed chance, it could have been a great movie with the right director, scenario and actors. It has replaced Troy at the bottom of my list and i never thought that it could be possible to make a worse antiquity movie than that. It gets a 1 from me, and i would like to propose that the horse that played Bucephalus gets the award for best acting in this movie for lack of acceptable human performances."
"brown301","1","13","22","21 November 2004"," I want to see the reviewers that actually liked this movie
","Marshall University had a sneak preview of Alexander, so I snagged some passes. What can I say? Very inexpensive date. What I found was a bloated, inane, indulgent piece of film, falling far short from Stone's talent and ability. The dialogue is stale, and at points, even laughable (especially between Alexander and his homosexual lovers, which critically hurts the film). Battle scenes are few and far between. Historical inaccuracies are abound (a Stone trademark), so much so that playing a game of Age of Empires would give you a better sense of history. And worst of all, the film is full of long winded monologues bordering on the Gods and Generals level of absurdity. Two positive things came out of the movie, however. 1. Val Kilmer actually acts in this movie instead of playing Val Kilmer playing someone else. 2. Rosario Dawson's fantastic body is confirmed. Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it is free."
"dramachick8989","1","12","20","27 May 2005"," A Waste Of Three Hours...
","This movie was a waste of three hours. The only redeeming quality is that Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Collin Farrel are attractive people. If you really want to see Roaario Dawson's body parts flopping around then this a movie for you. Just fast forward to that part. Other than that there's not much to say. The battle scenes were filmed well though. If there was actually a story line behind it the movie might have been OK. But nothing better. This movie was released too soon after Troy, which in my opinion was much better, and they were competing. Since Troy at least had a story line, it prevailed. Don't rent Alexander unless you have three hours with nothing, and I mean nothing, else to do. Cleaning the bathrooms would be a better option than having to sit through this again."

","This film should be used as an example of how NOT to produce a film. Everything about it is hideous in the extreme - the grating Irish accents in ancient Macedonia, the unending awful, babbling dialogue, particularly from Alexander's mother and Alexander himself - one tooth-grindingly terrible speech to Hepheisteion springs to mind. The music often sounds cheesy and grating in the extreme, the lack of structure of the film - the constant shuffling between Alexander's current campaign and scenes with his mother and father, with no apparent reason or need to do so (I watched the Director's cut). The casting! Angelina Jolie, no matter how beautiful she undoubtedly is, is never at all convincing as Colin Farrell's mother, Val Kilmer's wildly over-acted turn as Phillip, Alexander's father.

","After almost 50 years of paying, first my parents, then my own hard-earned money to see (..good!?!..) films in everything from flea-pits to plush, multi-screen cinemas, I can honestly say that this is the WORST film I have ever seen. It is appalling! Bad, ham acting, abysmal editing; crappy lighting; overdecorated and wobbly sets; and far, far more (and worse) that I won't bore the uninitiated with. From my own humble point of view the only good scene is the elephant rearing up onto its back legs; and even this would appear to be a direct infringement of the Fantasia copyright.<br/><br/>I know that Hollywood is supposed to be overflowing with out-of-work actors, not to mention the hundreds of would-be hopefuls who are said to arrive at the bus-station every day ... but surely the producers could have found someone with even slightly more talent than the Irish actor who played Alexander (I can't even, and don't want to, remember his name. I'm also too lazy to check the cast list by scrolling back through this site).<br/><br/>I think I have been overly generous by giving it a 1 rating - but they won't let us give negative 'e' numbers so I'll have to give it a moral raspberry instead and let sleeping dogs lie - 'cos this one should have died before it tried to bark."

","** Since I didn't finish watching this movie, there aren't any spoilers in this review! ** It's a rare thing for me to not finish watching a movie, even a bad one. However, this movie was so boring that, after an hour of enduring this talk fest, I just couldn't see waisting another precious minute of my life on watching it. Being historically accurate doesn't mean you have to be so stilted in your acting and directing that the movie becomes a painful drudgery just to sit through to the bloody end. Besides, the movie wasn't THAT accurate, anyway.<br/><br/>Half way into this movie, I realized that I had absolutely NO empathy for Alexander, or for any other character for that matter. The scenes, while rich in costumes and trappings, were devoid of anything that would've made me want to care what happened to Alexander. Even the battle scenes, which have been inexplicably lauded by many here, were actually quite ineffective, as well as inaccurate.<br/><br/>For example, the defeat of Darius was the climax of Alexander's life. The Greek defeat of the Persian forces in the mountains above the Plain of Issus stands as one of history's greatest victories by a vastly outnumbered army. It did NOT play out at all in the manner that was portrayed in the movie. For one, it took place in a mountain valley, after both armies had realized that they had actually marched PAST each other. Alexander had the great luck to discover this fact before Darius did, and managed to trap Darius's army in just the right place (a narrow mountain valley). Thus, the size of Darius' army, which would've been a huge advantage in the sort of battle depicted in the movie, actually turned into a major disadvantage that Alexander used very effectively.<br/><br/>This battle should've been the movie's climax, and should've taken a good two-thirds (or more) of the movie to set up. As it was, the crowning point in Alexander's life was relegated to a footnote, and was over in the first thirty minutes of the movie. After that, it was all downhill for this horrible movie.<br/><br/>For an example of the CORRECT way to tell the story of a General-King, try Kenneth Branagh's rendition of Shakespeare's Henry V. Henry V revolves around one of history's other unlikely victories, that of the defeat of the French by the vastly outnumbered British in the Battle of Agincourt."

","Wow. I watched the director's cut this weekend and was blown away at just how bad this movie is. I'm really surprised by the number of glowing reviews here at the IMDb. It had so many problems - poorly developed characters (pretty much all the side characters), bad dialogue, pointless jumps in timeline (sometimes this can be extremely effective, obviously, but in Alexander it served no purpose), lack of focus, and directorial overindulgence. I've read some of the threads comparing the director's cut with the theatrical release, and it seems that maybe some of the problems I had with the film, particularly on the character development front, are due to changes made for this cut. I hope that's the case. This film is convoluted, historically inaccurate, and more importantly, boring and self indulgent."

","Alexander was one of the dullest, slowest films I have ever seen. I can handle slow films. Many slow films are true masterpieces- (insert here some great examples that have yet to pop into my frontal lobes). Ooh, kind of like Alien. Slow, slow start, and then picks up the pace. 2001. Finding Neverland. But this was just...gah. It plodded along at a cold-molasses-in-tar-pit-in-ice-age speed. Much of the plot was incomprehensible. The pink fight scene was irritating. I actually wandered off and poked in on other films and played some of the games in the lobby. By the time I crashed back into the theater I swear, honest to god, that Alexander was still on the same sentence. When the film's credits finally creeped along the screen, many people were asleep, being shaken awake by family members unlucky enough to have held consciousness through all five thousand hours of nothing.<br/><br/>I felt guilty about spending half an hour in the lobby playing pinball and gorging myself on popcorn refills, so I bought a second ticket and saw the film again with one thought: ""I am going to sit through this thing if it kills me."" So I did. Of course, not much of it was spent in consciousness- scenes jumped ahead for no apparent reason until halfway through I realised I'd been asleep in bits. I managed to stay awake through the remainder of the film, surviving my gnawing my knees off. I could barely remember any of the film, it creeped along so slowly. And I left the cinema depressed that we've evolved thousands of years and we land ourselves with this.<br/><br/>What was bad about the film? Well, for one thing it was...s....l....o....o....w....w..... Even the action sequences were s...l...o...w... Hell, the sex scenes went something like ""p...e...l...v...i...c... t...h...r...u...s...t... a........h.......h......"" Second, bad acting. Terrible. I don't know what they were doing on screen, but it seemed like everyone had drunk five gallons of Robitussin and then ate snails off of the streets of Las Angeles before filming. Then, we have the rather bizarre pink sequence where everyone on screen is dying and Alexander is dying and the audience is dying or having acid flashbacks of pink elephants. No joke, you actually see pink elephants in this film.<br/><br/>What was good? I'm going to clichÃ© your intestines out your ears, but it's true- the ending. It felt like I was a man who'd been tortured for five days straight and then was pumped full of marijuana. It felt goooood.<br/><br/>And the nap did me well, too."
"bringa","1","10","16","11 April 2005"," Pointless, bland, disappointing
","I like historical epics; really, I do. When they're well done.<br/><br/>There's a couple of rules that apply to all films, be they thrillers, romances, or historical epics. One of them is that there has to be a theme, a central story the film is telling. Alexander has no theme.<br/><br/>The story completely falls apart; what we're watching is a little timid man, never a once likable, who leads a campaign far into the east for no reason really other than that he likes killing people and conquering places, apparently. And not even that we buy: he doesn't come across as that kind of person.<br/><br/>The writing is awful. Non-chronological storytelling is cool and all, but once more, you need to have a reason to it. When the assassination of King Phillip is first skipped to be then told later-on in a flashback, we wonder why. There's a weak connection in a character Alexander killed in the future that we see recommended as trustworthy friend to Alexander in the flashback, but that doesn't justify the flashback.<br/><br/>The visuals: very disappointing for this kind of budget. There were occasional eye-openers, but there were too few of them, and they happened too rarely. Generally, the movie consists of angry men yelling at each other with not the least hint of civilization about them. We never care for any of their stories; they just yell at each other and then return to being gay.<br/><br/>Now, my last point. It seems everyone concentrates on the homosexuality of this film. That is really missing the point, but if I have to say something about this quickly, I'll say this: even THIS aspect they got entirely wrong. Homosexuality was not even a concept back then. So men lay with boys and girls; so what. The film treats the concept from a modern point of view, and that's just retarded. One old man looked all shocked and disgusted after Alexander gave him a kiss; the Greek army-men joked ""what about the boys"" when Alexander promised their wives dowries befitting of heroes, and they joked in such a way that it was implied this was a great taboo topic. It just wasn't. So no, the homosexuality aspect doesn't get in the way any more than the rest of this crappy film (it gets old very soon, and that's all), but even that they did not get right.<br/><br/>This was a waste of great historical material. Watch something else."

The movie was supposed to be about Alexanders great conquests of lands unknown, but that whole idea got ensnared in homo-erotic stares that ate up screen time. It got to the point that I wanted them to screw and get it over with so we could resume the conquering(or lack thereof). Overall the movie left a bad taste in my mouth, something that other Oliver Stone movies have done before this. The fight scenes were nonexistent and the camera work of over dramatized. Brilliant scores accented scenes of horse races that ultimately ended abruptly with Alex and his gang camping in the mountains and complaining about going home. The narration was unspecific and confusing at best.<br/><br/>The final battle against the Persians was somewhat entertaining, but did not make up for the previous two hours of my high hopes being trampled under gay tension and witless banter.<br/><br/>I must say that besides Colin Farrell, the acting was superb. Val Kilmer brought his A game as always, and Jolie was extremely hot despite her unforgivable Russian accent.<br/><br/>If you are interested in seeing a good Oliver Stone film, look elsewhere.

With a star-studded cast, a high budget, and a biography of a fascinating conqueror, you would think this movie would be great! Unfortunately it is not.<br/><br/>The movie is about Alexander the Great, the Greek conqueror who conquered Egypt, Persia and up to the fringes of India by the time he was in his early thirties.<br/><br/>I remember reading about him in my world history class back in school and being fascinated about his life and his exploits. I eagerly anticipated the making of this movie hoping it would measure up to my expectation but it did not.<br/><br/>The movie was constantly going forward and backward in telling his life which made the movie chaotic. Maybe Oliver Stone was trying to be like Tarantino; if that is so, he failed.<br/><br/>Stone skirted the issue of Alexander's homosexuality by not revealing his this issue openly. Alexander's homosexuality should not be a controversy because he was. In our time, homosexuality is a big issue but during that time, in Greek society, it was a big deal. In fact, the Greek ideal relationship is between a grown man and a young boy.<br/><br/>In history, there has always been speculation whether Alexander was part of the plot to kill his father King Philip of Macedon because Philip had just taken another wife who had bore him a male child. This issue should have been more in the beginning of the story, but instead, it was shown in the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>I could keep going on and on with examples but you get the picture. Moreover, the battle scenes, while good, was not great.<br/><br/>Prior to the release of this movie, I saw a three hour documentary of Alexander on the History channel on cable television. It was fantastic. It literally blows away this movie ten times over. The story is told from the biography of Alexander, written by an ancient Greek and two Roman citizens. I believe one of the Romans only concentrated on Alexanders early years.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you really want to know about Alexander, his life, and his exploits, then go check that out, or better yet, go buy a book on his life."

The sudden push towards the end to prove that it was regicide and not a virus which did him in. This was an awful attempt and a good story. Yes the Greeks and the Romans were know to be gay, and thats fine, but most Americans hated this movie because it sucked from opening credits to the very end. The movie tended to jump around a lot and had to have subtitles to tell you when and where you were in time, since a base line in time was never established. The battles were long and drawn out and brought nothing interesting to the plot. Like Braveheart it was far from accurate, however Braveheart worked because you liked Wallace and hated the King. This movie you just hated everyone. They really should have re-title this movie Alexander: Now with less gay (still boring as mud)"

","I just saw Alexander. The beginning of the movie, that is. After less than a hour I turned it off.

Actually, I can't think of anything that was good with this movie.<br/><br/>Lately a lot of historical movies have been done. First came The Gladiator, which I enjoyed. Then came Troy, which also was a good movie. Then came King Arthur, a bad movie. And now, finally, Alexander.

"spotter-8","1","11","18","30 December 2004"," Spoilproof Alert
","I must first say that there is NO way I could spoil this movie no matter what I might write about it. Oliver Stone spoiled it long before I ever got to see it. This is the only movie I've ever seen where afterward I felt cheated enough to ask for my money back. I got it, too.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Alexander the Great was a conqueror, but we only get to see two of the many battles he fought. Gaugamela began promisingly, but then the overhead battle scenes were all filmed during a titanic dust storm so that it was impossible to tell who was fighting...or even if anyone was fighting. The closeup battle scenes appear to have been filmed by a shaky man with a camcorder bouncing on a pogo stick during an earthquake accompanied by a slightly less dense dust storm. The second battle scene had a jungle obscuring most of the activity and most of it was shot through a bad red filter anyway. We get a LOT more footage than that suggesting that Alexander was really, really, really gay.<br/><br/>Take away the conquering, and what do you have left? Nothing worth the price of admission. They gave the actor playing Alexander (who spent most of the time with a deer-in-the-headlights stare) a hair dye job that looked like a pile of old straw on his head. Having done that, couldn't they have done something about his thick, black woolly-bear caterpillar eyebrows? Every time he was on camera my gaze was drawn irresistibly towards them. <br/><br/>Early on in the film we are treated to a CGI image of the great harbor at Alexandria over the shoulder of Hannibal Lecter Ptolemy as he begins talking about Alexander to a scribe. In the harbor can be seen two ships under way, one under sail, the other under oars. After THREE PLUS HOURS of mixed no-action scenes and windy Ptolemaic narrative, we get to see the great harbor again. Both ships are still there. Neither has moved a cubit. This could be said to be symbolic of the whole movie. At what I thought was the end, Ptolemy advises the scribe who has been assiduously writing it all down to just throw all of the pages away. Would that the studio had done the same with the movie. The ONLY thing that could have made this turgid lump of celluloid enjoyable would have been to see it accompanied by Mike Nelson and the 'bots from MST3K. More than one person walked out before the film was over. I wonder if they wanted their money back also?"
"siaghnon","Null","11","18","25 November 2004"," I Loved This Film
","Saw Alexander last night and loved it. Would I recommend it? Yes-BUT-be forewarned, this is not your classic historical epic so leave behind all ideas of what an historic epic film should be and bring along an open the mind for a wonderful ride. After all, one doesn't expect Ben-Hur or The Robe or The Ten Commandments from Oliver Stone. He uses jumpy camera shots and grainy filters as well as wonderful color filters that give the battle scenes a viscerally disturbing edge, taking the viewer out of their complacent acceptance of 21st century, violent battle scenes and making them squirm. I felt the desiccating heat at Gaugamel as well as the cloying humidity of the Indian forests. The grandeur of the CGI presentation of Babylon was awe inspiring as was the set for the Library at Alexandria.<br/><br/>The subtle presentation of the film in Greek Tragedy format worked well for me, from Pharoah Ptolomy representing the chorus through the Oedipal angst of Alexander's love/hate relationship with his parents. The costuming was perfection, as was the architecture. Not once was I jolted by an incorrect piece of art, jewelry, fabric or weapon. The use of a Gypsy Horse (or Irish Cob) for Bucephalus was a striking choice. They are a majestic breed and, although I am under-educated as to what his actual breed was, he was well cast.<br/><br/>Before seeing the film I was only aware of Messers Stone and Farrell and Ms. Jolie's involvement so I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of Brian Blessed as the wrestling master and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Cassander, and I was thrilled by the Vangelis score! I have not heard a Vangelis score since The Bounty. <br/><br/>As for the representation of love between Alexander and Hephaestion, my hat is off to Oliver Stone for his presentation of a love that transcended gender and was as true as that Paris held for Helen. Unlike the recent film of Troy, in which the lovers Achilles and Patroclus were made into platonic cousins, Oliver Stone has courageously represented an historic love to a culture wherein the attitude towards male/male pairings have become anethema. That the Great General Alexander had a male life companion is a simple fact of history as we know it. In my years at school it was not presented as either laudable or offensive, it was simply a researched fact. History as we know it tells us that the Greece of Alexander's time looked upon such pairings as Alexander's and Hephaestion's as something acceptable as long as they grew in knowledge and virtue. Christopher Plummer's Aristotle sums this up in one simple speech near the beginning of the film and, by taking Ganymede to his side, the greatest of all Greek Gods, Zeus, sanctioned such pairings. Like it as not, right or wrong, the *gender issue* and *gay issue* are a none other than a matter of popular opinion, and popular opinion at the time of Alexander was that men lay down with men as well as women. It simply was, and that is how Oliver Stone handled it-simply-without defense or apology and that took guts.<br/><br/>Even without the *controversial* relationship between Alexander and Hephaestion, this would have been a 9.5 out of 10 for me."

","Reading these reviews -- well, some of them, I don't have all day you know -- it seems folks either really love this film or really hate it. I find absolutely nothing to love here. The movie is far too long, the plot has no cohesion at all (strange for a historical epic), and most critically the star is utterly miscast and over his head. <br/><br/>I don't know what Colin Farrell did to deserve top billing in a $150M project. He's a perfectly fine actor, but perfectly fine actors are a drachma a dozen. ""Alexander"" needed a big swinging dick to fill this role. Farrell looks like a guy from Duran Duran. Angelina Jolie is certainly A-list material, but her role is too fragmented and, quite frankly, her performance is so ludicrous that it supplied the only real enjoyment I derived from this whole mess. To see her literally covered with snakes and intoning absurd lines like ""My son you must face your glorious destiny"" with an out-REG-uss ack-SENT that was once the sole province of James Bond villains. The fact that Jolie and Farrell can't be more than a few years apart in age completes the fiasco.<br/><br/>Another point of hilarity, this time courtesy of Stone: during the Gaugamela battle scene, Alex is heard to order his troops ""back and to the left!"" not once, but twice."

","Unlike some others I didn't allow this film to waste a full 3 hours of my life. At first I was put off by the pouting of Angelina -very distracting but no half so laughable as the shallow dialogue and the snakes accompanied by meaningful glances with no meaning at all. When I watched the first battle scene I found it impossible to work out where any section of the army was or why the force of 40,000 stood a chance against an enemy 6 times the size - particularly as the Persians seemed to have an unbelievably mighty barrage of the archers who were able to fill the sky with arrows at each release.Then Alexander and his chums ride adjacent to the enemy almost without challenge followed by a single rider who is able to ride right past the enemy and find Alexander to mutter something about a conspiracy.The crowning glory was the Keystone Cops exit of the Persian King,Darius, in a cloud of dust (or am I mixing him up with the Lone Ranger?) However, most of the Persian army seemed to be still standing and to have inflicted dreadful damage to the Greeks but moments later it was stated that the Greeks had taken the victory. I watched the film in the first place because I know little about Alexander but all I feel I gained was the knowledge that he preferred men.Furthermore I think a warrior of his prowess requires a far more powerful physique than Mr Farrell. Prior to this I have really enjoyed Stone's work."

However, the Greeks, who didn't look or sound Greek, the Macadonians, who didn't look or sound Macadonian, and so on were expected to give their lines in awful Scottish, Irish, and English accents. It was a rare occasion when anyone resembled who they should have looked or sounded like. I can't even begin to imagine who Angelie Jolie was supposed to be sounding like. And of course they didn't bother to age her when she should have been aging.<br/><br/>It was like a throwback to a time when directors didn't have a clue what things were like. But in this day and age of world wide travel and the world wide web, it's almost impossible not to find the answer to that question.<br/><br/>And to top things off, I understand that Mr. Stone didn't do this movie once, not twice, but three times???

A better idea would be to produce a long running television series in the same style as David Milch's ""Deadwood"" which was a huge success on both sides of the water! Milch's Shakespearian style worked perfectly for Deadwood because of the intrigue and plotting involved of so many people. Imagine the intrigue, plotting and murder during Alexander's time.

"zaisjr","1","4","5","21 January 2010"," Awful, absolutely dreadful!!!!
","I will first give a ""Spoiler Alert"". Not because I'll really tell you anything specific about the movie's events, but because I'm going to summarize this heaping pile of dung.<br/><br/>First off, I'm someone who really finds the historical character Alexander the Great to be one of the most amazing figures ever. I don't think he was really a good guy at all, but he had many honorable qualities and was one of the best war strategists ever. He was so important to our world that it's believed that he was prophesied in the Bible. He helped shape our world as we know it. To this day people study his war strategies. His life's relation to the King of Persia is one of the greatest historical stories ever.<br/><br/>With that, how on Earth can you make an awful movie from Alexander's great legacy? Don't worry, Oliver Stone stepped up to the plate. Oliver Stone made a 2+ hour movie that mainly showed Alexander being a whiney little brat spending all his time in drunken orgies. It's like the whole movie is about Alexander's sexuality and not his life achievements. To show my point, the King of Persia is dead minutes after the movie starts. Oliver Stone totally blew that chance to add irony, symbolism, and suspense to this movie.<br/><br/>The only actor who came close to fitting his or her character was Angelina Jolie. Colin Farrel was an awful ""Alexander"", resembling more of a sexually frustrated and confused surfer dude. Rosario Dawson's appearance was pointless, unless you just wanted to see her nude. Val Kilmer was one of the worst choices you could have to play Alexander's father. Jared Leto had no business being in this movie. Might as well put Jessica Simpson in this movie while you're at it.<br/><br/>To put this movie into perspective, imagine Oliver Stone doing a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. If he followed this model, King's speech would be 15 minutes into the movie, he would be played by Eminem, and the rest of the movie would deal with his affairs that he allegedly had. It would miss the point completely, which this movie did.<br/><br/>If you like movies and history, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it re-affirms my belief that Oliver Stone needs to retire."

Each ""A-list"" actor in the cast has monumental acting talent and all have brilliant previous performances under their belt. The budget was clearly copious and all this, together with the central theme of Alexander the Great, should have been the ingredients to a cinema epic!<br/><br/>Alas all these ingredients just didn't mix - instead the film truly curdles into failure.

My reasons for this are as follows: 1. All the actors had horrible non realistic accents.<br/><br/>2. The leading actor who played Alexander was completely unsuitable for the role.<br/><br/>3. There was an over excessive use of make up on every single actor in pretty much all the scenes.<br/><br/>4.

Alexander's last battle was shown and depicted horribly. At first it was explained that Alexander almost never lost any battle but apparently at the end he is horribly and easily wounded by a bunch of people on elephants.<br/><br/>6. The homosexual relationship which Alexander had with his friend was shown way too often in the movie.

I couldn't remember hearing anything about the film, good or bad, except I seemed to remember it was generally thought Farrel was mis-cast. I am truly astounded that the film is not infamous for being the worst film ever made, for surely it is. From the very first second to the last it is truly appalling - the acting, the dialogue, the directing, the cinematography.... everything. Is it a deliberate parody? is it comedy irony? I swear, if Mel Brooks was going to make a 'Young Frankenstein' version of Alexander, this is exactly what he would have made. He wouldn't change a line. I had the same feeling with this film as I get when watching the early work of Leslie Nielsen - his work on Airplane! and Police Squad (I suppose I have to mention the inferior Naked Gun movies too) means his deadpan delivery is immediately funny; unfortunately I forget he used to be a straight actor and when you see him in 60s and 70s shows like Columbo or Kojak, he uses exactly the same deadpan delivery and you can't help but laugh at all his lines and actions, even though it's supposedly serious drama. This ""is this serious or is it supposed to be funny"" feeling runs right through Alexander. I actually did laugh out loud at nearly all the scenes with 'snakes are just like people' Jolie and 'ah-ha jim lad' Kilmer, and Farrel showed his comic genius when he pulled his Ben Turpin wide-eyed manic stare when deciding whether to chase Darius or go back and save his baggage train. As historical epics go, it's as funny as Life of Brian. I was unsure whether to give the film a 1 as the worst film or a 10 as one of the funniest parodies I've seen in a while.

He's just damn good at grabbing your attention, despite everything else. The music after that (and throughout the entire movie) was not grand which one might have expected, but rather pompous and therefore just plain 'big and loud'.<br/><br/>Alexander's role (the older one), by Colin Farrell, was performed just about 'ok'. Some nice scenes here and there in the (long) movie, but overall, I must confess that during the battle (again, overly dramatic and pompous) where he is critically wounded, I simply couldn't care less what was going to happen to him. Not caring one bit is just about the worst thing that can happen to an audience, hence the low rating. It's not just that half scared, half surprised expression at strange moment that Colin's tries to share with you, it's the entire package of his lines, the scene cuts and several dialogues that somehow just don't seem to work very well.<br/><br/>Annoyances: the bloody Scottish accent (what a completely daft decision that was!), the many time shifts going back and forth several years, the music in general and some of the makeup on the wounded men that was just too much and 'arranged in an esthetically pleasing way like a bouquet of flowers' for a 'convincing picture'... not! There are some moment where you can feel the movie could have been something rather grand, epic and moving, but overall, it just seems to hobble along for 167 minutes, with a surprisingly high number of moments where you go 'wait a sec, no way...'.

And i love most of Oliver's movies but this is just on the realm of being a movie one wants to walk out of esp the tacky cgi scenes that look like something out of a 50s or Japanese godzilla movie, not to mention the gay scenes that lack any substance resembling any depth so at the end of the movie one is left trying to root for the main character because no other character is developed besides his crazy mother who you're not sure if she is medusa, a witch or a demented mother, and the last funny issue is how many characters have lost an eye in this movie that you wonder if they are a part of some macedonian fraternity. I can not stress how this movie is not worth 8 dollars and i debate if worth 3 for rental comparing it to Troy which at least had redeeming characters and a story with a decent flow and fight scenes that made one believe Brad Pitt was capable of fighting.. there is not one scene where Colin shows what motivated him to travel over 10000 miles and over 10 years or what his genius or skills in battle with a sword or hand to hand combat were except a few vague horribly shot blurry quick scenes but ill just leave by saying Oliver please please next time hire some decent writers that know structure, character arcs and a better cgi company.. i mean bablyon looks like a cheap vegas which by the way was burned down by Alexander in a drunken spree which you never put in the movie.... no wonder the greeks are ashamed of your trite movie... just think twice next time when you decide to make a movie - what is your message, and what is the point for wasting one year of your life and eons of money that could have been used on at least 10 independent films but this is an embarrassment of a movie that should have been shelved if you didn't spend so much money and peoples time and money at the theatre. <br/><br/>A Big Thumbs down.. and i went in with low expectations.. and i still came out disappointed sitting thru 3 hours of what could have been told in 2 hours or less.... ps. next time hire an independent editor with some sanity."

","I want my 3 hours back. The fight scenes were horrible (except for the 1st one). The death of Alexander seemed to take forever. There was poor correlation to going back 8 years to his father's death. His cinematography gave me and my party a headache. I love history, but at times it was hard to follow what was going on.<br/><br/>If your going to make a movie that last 3 hours, like ""Return of the King"", the make it interesting. This plot had so much potential and once again Old Oliver Stone screwed it up. I should have not given him the benefit of the doubt by his previous mistakes.<br/><br/>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
"FreddyShoop","1","4","5","26 November 2004"," Nothing ""Great"" about Stone's Alexander.
","This film is a complete disappointment. Oliver Stone just couldn't get out of his own way on this film. This film needed to be made by someone like Mel Gibson (a la Braveheart and Patriot). I'm surprised that Troy trounces this movie so completely by comparison, but it does.<br/><br/>Nothing is worse, by definition, than an ordinary ""epic"" picture. At no point in this film will you be riveted or even substantially interested in the characters. The film wanders all over the place, not because Alexander did, but because of the uneven (and often uninteresting) influences in the film. Alexander's parents are portrayed as a hateful, dysfunctional couple, but this influence isn't well developed in Alexander. Does he love them or hate them? Neither really, so it is puzzling that Stone wastes so much time (in this 3 hour movie) to deal with the issue. The parents show up largely in flashbacks (Phillip a la Val Kilmer) or the constant intrusion of snakes (Olympias a la Angelina Jolie the snake lover), and the only reason they do is because of the need to give the ""stars"" their screen time. The movie suffers as a consequence.<br/><br/>Another waste of time is Alexander as the gay action hero. As Mick LaSalle of the SF Chronicle points out this is a hazy waste of time. At least 30 minutes of screen time could have been saved by dumping this worthless side story overboard. The history is ambiguous on the issue, and most importantly IT IS BESIDES THE POINT. Alexander wasn't a world conqueror because he may have been bi-sexual, so it merely distracts from what drives Alexander to conquer the world. The other sexual story of Alexander taking an unknown Afghan woman as a wife was unintentionally hilarious. The wedding night naked wrestling slap fight with his new bride (Roxane a la sultry Rosario Dawson...check out 25th Hour) is comical, bizarre and then trite, but she is naked with the ever present snake imagery reminding us of Alexander's mother...yeah yeah Oedipus, got it.<br/><br/>So the movie wanders here and there (just like this review). Colin Farrell tries to be convincing as an Alexander with bug eyes, but doesn't succeed. Maybe he could have if Stone hadn't messed the story up, but he doesn't. Farrell's Alexander is unimpressive and whiny. He needed to rent a few movies to check out any historical warrior done by Mel Gibson, Liam Neeson, or Russell Crowe. Basically, Farrell just can not create the gravitas that these actors can in their historical roles. If he were younger, Kenneth Branaugh would have been ideal if he packed on 20 lbs of muscle. Eric Bana, who was Hector in Troy, could have done a very good job with this role. Besides, the fact that Bana showed he could play such a historical character, he would have been enough of a professional to dump his accent (as an Aussie) unlike Mr. Irish Guy. In order to cover up Farrell's inability to dump his accent, Stone has the rest of the Greek generals speak with an Irish accent. Whatever, it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Jolie is o.k. as Alexander's mother, although her youth makes it appear impossible. For some reason they didn't bother to try and age her with makeup. She plays the role with intensity, and conveys the strategic nature of Olympia. However, she gets too much screen time considering the impact of her character, and the Russian or whatever accent she had is distracting because it sticks out and is inconsistent with the rest of the accents. Oh well, if Sean Connery can do a Russian Sub Captain with a Scottish accent, I guess Jolie can do it too.<br/><br/>The real surprise here is how effective Anthony Hopkins is as Ptolemy, and how he helps move the story along. Actually, I guess it shouldn't be surprising that Hopkins is good. It is just that his abilities are striking when compared with the other's substantial failures.<br/><br/>What a waste, this could have been a great film, but in Stone's inept hands it is mediocre at best. If you must see it, go see a matinÃ©e otherwise you'll feel ripped off."

","11 of us went to see Alexander on Thanksgiving. We all fell asleep at one time or another. This may be the worst movie I've ever paid for. It was like a 4 hour history lecture with no visual aids. Yeah, the acting was probably good, but I was too distracted trying to stay awake to notice. 20 minutes of dialog between 2 people about ""I hate you, I love you, I hate you"", immediately followed by a 20 minute history lesson would bore the heck out of anyone. <br/><br/>The Macedonians had all kinds of accents; most of them were English, Scottish and Irish (maybe some Australians in there, too). But some of them had fake Persian accents. <br/><br/>A half hour is spent taking a conversation to climax. Insert action? Nope.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins gives you the short version of what went down as the next event is already being played. Those of you who saw the movie will remember this example: Alexander makes one of his lengthy rah-rah speeches about continuing over the hills through India. His men want to go home, start talking smack and throw stuff. Bam! They're in the the forest in India. How did this happen?<br/><br/>Don't see it. Don't rent it. Kick anyone in the pants who says it's a good movie."
"windstorm88","1","4","5","25 November 2004"," Bad, bad Mr. Oliver Stone!
","Shame Mr. Oliver Stone. Shame. This was a horrible, horrible movie. Despite desperately trying to keep to history as well as maintain some entertainment value, the serious homoerotic overtones and the first battle scenes are the only redeeming factors in the entire movie. That, and Colin Farrell's pretty, pretty face - which cried entirely too much! He didn't need to find the ocean to take him home, the amount he cried alone...anyways. The homosexual plot lines were entertaining (there are two), although when he kissed his mother and the Persian boy I believe the entire audience spontaneously freaked out. The one kiss actually MISSING from the movie was him kissing his friend Hephaistion, but I shall leave that for another time. Altogether, bad acting, bad directing, bad plot lines, but camel warfare. Make up your own mind."

","I'm sorry if you liked Alexander, I really am. I am a guy that went to the movie thinking, like most other guys, it would be something like Gladiator. I was wrong. After one battle scene, that took forever to get to, nothing happened. Well, I'm exempting the fact that the story would be going along then a gay reference would be thrown in. I mean come on the guy was gay we get it, don't throw in a he-she every few scenes... I only stayed hoping, telling myself that there was going to be another battle pretty soon, because it was made to look like that from the trailers. But nope, I was dissappionted again. And it is THREE HOURS. That is important to know, because after two hours and your legs start to go stiff and your butt hurts. After that you will know that it wasn't worth the money you paid.<br/><br/>I would have to say that there was too much gay, not enough fighting for a ""war epic"", too long when it could have been a lot shorter, and most of all, been more actual movie than ongoing conversation. <br/><br/>And a tip to those who are forced into going by a girlfriend or family or are just going because you have nothing better to do, I would highly recommend a cell phone with games or a cd player and pillow."
"astakos1973","1","4","5","23 November 2004"," A miserable failure of a movie
","This movie was awful. It was long, boring, and focused on the side-show of Alexander's life instead of his adventures. The acting was unconvincing and soupy. The story was tedious and long on speculation and details about Alexander's sexual proclivities, yet mentions almost nothing about his philosophy or strategising other than some vague desire for a multi-cultural empire. That ""multi-culturalism"" seems more a commentary on Oliver Stone's vision of a utopian world than anything Alexander tried to achieve. I'm not surprised the Greek government refused to co-operate with the production of the movie. Instead of letting viewers see the history and glory of Ancient Greece, this movie gives an introspective look at a bunch of characters who look, sound, and act more like Celts in Greek attire."
"lkgamard","Null","21","40","27 November 2004"," Definitely more appreciated by those who have studied the man and the culture
","When my father and I sat down to see this movie, I told him that whenever I shook my fist at the screen, that would mean they were doing something historically inaccurate. See, I was expecting this movie to make a blunder just as bad as _Troy's_ leaving Agamemnon dead in Ilion. However, I was pleasantly surprised; I didn't need to shake my fist as often as I'd anticipated. I don't claim to be an expert on classical culture or on Alexander, but I can say as one who has studied his life and times that the movie did quite a good job portraying him.<br/><br/>There were, of course, things I would change about the movie. The three biggest annoyances (for me) follow: 1. Olympias was not shown frolicking with a snake in bed (at least not by herself before Alexander was born). The mythology surrounding this part of Alexander's background -- which explains why the marriage between Olympias and Philip was strained -- could have led to a much more complex relationship between Olympias and Philip on screen. 2. The movie was chronologically fragmented. I'm not a student of cinema, just of the classics, so I don't know what the purpose in doing this was, but it was fairly annoying. 3. Alexander's _Braveheart_-like motivational speeches certainly didn't add as much to the movie as they probably should have. If it were me, I would focus on his military tactics -- for example, the impressive strategy in the Persian battle portrayed on screen -- instead of the ""glooooooory"" Farrell keeps yelling about.<br/><br/>I won't pick on little things forever... I'll leave that to someone else. I will tell, however, the three things I liked most about the movie: 1. The ""grey area"" relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion was wonderfully portrayed. If you don't understand the way two ancient Greek men were able to love one another, I suggest you go back to college and re-take the courses in classics you obviously slept through. You'll appreciate your new found outlook on western culture. 2. The Macedonian phalanx... ah, great fun to watch. 3. Alexander's many motivations -- his character was obviously complex, and Farrell seemed to do a decent job with it. From the obsession with Homer's Iliad to the alcoholism, we as the audience are given enough credit not to have to watch a one-sided Alexander on screen, and I really appreciated that.<br/><br/>No movie is ever perfect, and this one isn't either. Every director/producer/whatever is going to take dramatic license with a subject, and that was obviously done here with _Alexander_. The History Channel does a great 3-hour documentary on his life, so if that's what you're looking for, tune into cable. However, if you're looking for entertainment, and you're well-educated enough about ancient Greek culture and the life of Alexander to be able to appreciate what's going on instead of getting hung up on certain aspects of the story, I definitely recommend going to see this movie."
"emikulina","8","20","38","29 November 2004"," It works!
","This movie is a nice surprise; after all horrible Hollywood trash about Ancient World (like 'Troy') we are getting a film which is relatively honest with history - at least, it doesn't have any obvious glaring mistakes. It is anti-war - yet battles are very impressive. It is, in short, about illusions and how people lose them - the main illusion being Alexander's idea that he can 'free' - liberate - the whole world. Very American, and very naive - and that's exactly what the director wants us to understand. The rest - 'gay' relationships with friends etc is, a) immaterial - they just help to show that the her is not happy, which is natural for a king; b) historically true. Alexander is shown as a week, troubled, but personally charming and charismatic human being: no stupid pathos or attempts to idealize him, which is nice. Colin Farrell is VERY good - in fact, despite his Irish looks, he manages to look like Alexander on his existing portraits and also to look very Greek - as some genuine statues and mosaics. He also shows good complex acting - his Alexander is a man with problems and<br/><br/>not just a cartoon. Yet - no hamming or OVER-acting, which is a credit to young actor, too. Val Kilmer as Alexander's father is splendid. Angelina Jolie is not so good, and there is too much of her. A very good film - long, but not boring, sad, but not tearful. In short, it shows that great director and fine actors can make even film about Alexander the Great work - a fact which never yet happened in movie history (just for comparison, see 'Alexander the Great' with Richard Burton - and see just how bad it was and just how good Colin Farrell is)."
"kersus","1","14","25","3 August 2005"," The film that will never end.
","One could argue that this is a two star film only on the acting, which wasn't bad at all. The writing and directing was horrible, and I can't believe Oliver Stone made this movie. What could have been the movie of the year was a waste of time.<br/><br/>It presents itself more as a history documentary than an action/drama movie. Thus you have very little in the way of character development or plot. Yet it doesn't even give one a good grasp of the history. The script was just terrible. There is no clear view of what is going on at all times. None of the secondary characters were developed at all.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were jumpy and not exciting. There was no overview of the battles so you can't really see what's going on. The action sequences were poorly made. Only the horse vs. the elephant had any presence and it's a long movie to watch if you're waiting for that.<br/><br/>While one cannot blame the actor's for this movie, it was indeed a long terrible slow painful waste of time. Even Angelina Jolie actually put up a decent performance (although casting her as Colin Farrell's mother who doesn't age in 25 years is a little iffy), yet none of the acting in the world could have saved this movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to offer a real analysis of this film because it had no real good points to work with. Just do not see this expecting well made battle scenes, or words that hit the heart, or moving drama, or anything good that can come from a movie. All is lost here.<br/><br/>All in all, I knew it was a movie I had to see anyway. I have deep interest in history and Alexander and the mythology of the time. For me it was worth the risk, but this movie will never be owned by me or watched again. It doesn't even contain anything of little interest. It isn't what I would expect from Oliver Stone. It isn't a new interesting angle. It isn't the truth no one wants to hear. It isn't really accurate.<br/><br/>ALSO The 2 Disc Director's Cut DVD features - VERY SPARSE! There are a couple trailers (which are well made and are not representative of the movie) for the movie and a documentary. The two discs is a marketing gimmick only. It could easily have fit on one disc and you'd still be disappointed in the lack of extras."
"fred-287","Null","14","25","25 February 2005"," Oliver Stone has finally ""lost it...""
","Of course Mr. Stone can still sling a yarn, but previously one always felt one at least knew why he wanted to do the project in the first place; now he seems out of sorts, not really knowing what to do with himself. Clearly a lot of material had to be excluded for a palatable cinematic running time; maybe this would have been better as a mini-series on HBO or something. The movie's chief weakness for me is Irish ""heart-throb"" Colin Farrell in the title role; apparently Stone sees Alexander as a kind of ancient Greek Hamlet, and if there's any quality that Farrell doesn't exude very well, it's self-doubt. Farrell seems confused as to whether Alexander is supposed to be gay or straight or ""bi"" or whatever and is convincing in none of those capacities. (In the scenes with Rosario Dawson from ""The Rundown"" I actually worried about his physical well-being.) Also, to be convincing as somebody who had to keep pushing endlessly for new worlds to conquer, there had to be just a touch of lunacy lurking. Maybe Jude Law could have carried it off or even Ewan McGregor. But it's always fun watching Angelina Jolie especially when she's playing with snakes and/or doing an exotic accent, and a lot of the visuals are gorgeous, especially the Babylon scenes. But it's definitely time for Anthony Hopkins to retire, I mean seriously; after ""The Human Stain"" and now this, he needs to get knighted, settle down and write his tell-all autobiography..."

","I just saw the new Oliver Stone film ""Alexander"" at a free screening at the University of Pennsylvania sponsored by Polo Jeans, and I honestly have to say that this movie was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I am usually someone who tries to find the good in any film, but this movie was so horrendous that I feel a moral obligation to the IMDb community...no, the world, to warn everyone of the monstrosity that is ""Alexander."" Everything about this movie is flat out horrible. I can't think of one thing the film does well, other than the last half hour, which is so unintentionally hilarious it almost makes the first 7 hours worth sitting through. In the theater I was at, people were booing and yelling out ""worst movie ever!"" and ""just end already!"" and someone even went up to the projector and started doing shadow puppets with their hands in the last few seconds of the movie, which was followed by everyone cheering. I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard. My friend was crying he was laughing so hard. People were walking out of the theater early. <br/><br/>Please, do not reward the makers of this film by paying to see it. Oliver Stone should be shot (In the foot of course, nothing lethal). If you can see this movie for free and don't care about wasting 7 hours or however long it was (it sure felt like 7 hours), go ahead because it is worth the laughs in the end because it is so terrible."

I really disappoint with Ptomely (Anthony Hopkins), who talks too much, talk and talk and talk, seem like Oliver Stone afraid that the audiences can't understand what he wants to show. But, Colin Farrell is great. He shows a weak side of Alexander so well and heroic side also. Maybe, when making a movie about a great hero, and that hero has weakness, like homosexual, cry so much and love so much, people think ""Man, it's suck"". I don't know. I think this movie is great. I know more about a life of someone who conquered the world. Someone loved and died for love. Someone that lonely...In the end, when Alexander died, his last vision haunted me.

","When I saw the first trailer for this movie I knew this was going to be a must see. When it arrived in theatres in the US and I saw the awful critics appear on this website, I knew for sure that I needed to see this film. I mean, Americans make no sense (in general that is). Movies that shouldn't do well such as the acclaimed masterpiece of Mel Gibson, 'The passion' are through the roof. Obviously, this film was amazing for the land in which God is bigger than common sense, and therefore it made a lot of money. As if God himself would punish you if you didn't see this film. With Alexander it's somewhat different. Since Americans seem to have forgotten that their civilisation is founded in Europe they have should be interested in what is shown in this amazing film. If you don't like history on school, which by the way is perfectly understandable, check this flick out and be amazed by the gained wisdom when you'll leave this theatre. I for one, did not hate history, in fact, I was rather interested in discovering why we are what we are today. And this guy, Alexander, has played a major part in our becoming. Colin Farrel plays probably the role of his life. A stronghold on screen no doubt about it. He delivers with great passion, not as Brad Pitt did in Troy, but I'm talking about genuine heroïsm and character. Angelina Jolie, indeed talking with a strange accent, is simply amazing. Not only the way she looks, but also what she says and the way she brings it just blew me away. I have to admit that I love this kind of films, but this one can easily measure up against Braveheart. It's twice the movie than Troy was and kicks Gladiator's ass big time. A great epic, which is to my regret, misunderstood or totally not understood by the most ""civilised"" part of the world, USA. But hey, what would you expect, there are the people that re-elected Mister Bush. I mean, Oliver, don't feel bad about this at all. In fact, be amused by it. You've done great!<br/><br/>I give this film as you can see only a 9 out of 10 because the soundtrack, and this is the only part, was awful.

","It is obvious that many people would dislike this movie from the minute it starts because they are not going to want to hear that Alexander the Great was GAY. Yeah, he liked to bang guys but this is as factual as ancient history can be. I graduated as a history major, and if there is one thing i have learned about ancient history, it is that facts are a very grey area. You can only go by what you have to interpret an event. As for the film itself, i thought it was excellent. It follows the genre of epic historical films (like Braveheart, Troy, Spartacus...etc) and does so with some conventional wizardry.<br/><br/>The dialogue was beautiful and elequent, the flashbacks were not boring and easy, but challenged the audience, which i liked (God bless the A.D.D. audience---you prolly slit your wrists!) I enjoyed Anthony Hopkins as Ptolmey, and was Surprised at Colin Ferrel's acting ability. I enjoyed his performance, which is the only thing i feared going into the film. I also enjoyed Oliver Stone's citation of his own work (Scarface) in the dialogue ""The World is Yours"". I thought the Gaugamela battle scene was intense, and the presence of the Eagle in that scene took my breath away. What the feeble-minded miss in Oliver Stone's pictures is his keen sense of detail when dealing with culture. 10 years ago, someone making a film about Alexander would have left out ANY AND EVERYTHING homosexual. Also, i feel that he tended to the Grecian Pagan religion very well... (Instead of them saying Oh God...they name a God they would prey to for the situation. Stone is an excellent filmmaker and proved it many ways in this film, so much so that I could write a book about it. <br/><br/>It was an excellent film, i give it 4 out of 4 stars and i will prolly go and see it again."

It's almost as amazing that some reviewers liked this film! Takes all kinds, I guess; that's what makes the world go round. Oliver Stone misses the boat entirely in depicting a great man. Instead, he gives us an unimposing, doe-eyed, teary, sexually-confused and preoccupied wimp (maybe some viewers relate to this in our world today) in the form of Colllin Farrell. Aside from my opinion that Farrell is badly miscast, it is just unbelievable that this character could conquer anything, much less the world! The film is way too talky, spends way too much time on Alexander's emotional and sexual soul-searching  which all comes off as an indulgent waste of time in a bloated film that cries out for major editing. The plot wanders, the viewer is subjected to LONG stretches of dialog that go nowhere, and one is left shaking their head and mumbling, ""THIS was Alexander?"" Stone got lost back in there somewhere, and forgot that however flawed, any man as great as Alexander had to have been epic in some fashion. This movie never gets there. And get a good helmet!

","Why, Oliver Stone, why? This movie made me actually consider never watching another period piece ever again. This is also the first movie to ever make me seriously consider getting up and leaving the theater. Oliver Stone even said this movie was schlock. He wanted to do it because the story is one of the greatest ever told. However, that being said, a lot of people want their hands on it. Oliver Stone (Natural Born Killers, Any Given Sunday, Platoon) was not allowed to make the movie he wanted. I know he produced it, and co-wrote it, but it must have been the execs that screwed him over here. Casting choices are unbelievably stupid. And the way the story has been edited does not fit together sensically. Okay, so Rosario Dawson and Anjelina Jolie are hot... but why do they sound like Nosferatu?? I won't go off on Colin Farrell, but honestly he cannot stop that accent! He's Irish... NO, he's American, NO... he's SOMETHING THAT ISN'T MEDITERRANEAN! Now, how was this Irish kid born from transylvanian Jolie and American Val Kilmer. By the way I think Val Kilmer's performance was pretty good,keeping in mind that NO ONE'S accent made sense. And I know there are so many aspects to this story, you could make a ten hour movie,but they should have picked one part and told it. I just don't understand why at the END of the movie, they would choose to go back and show Blondie's coronation. Through the whole movie, I'm wondering why in God's name is Alexander king already? Where's his father? At least they cleared that up, but they spent about 5 minutes on it. It's a crucial turning point to the story, don't you think? Out of a 3 hour movie, it's amazing to me how much they downplayed actual historical events and filled up all that space with painful unneeded schlock. And that's why I'm going to stick to books or comics when there is a great story at risk of being butchered by terrible casting, editing, acting and really anything else that can go wrong with a movie. Example? Alexander. The worst movie I have ever seen and ever expect to see."

","Oliver Stone is a director that you either love or hate, there is no in the middle. I happen to be one of those people who enjoy Oliver Stone films mostly, though, I agree he is excessive with his vision. This is one of those movies that is excessive. Alexander is a huge Roman epic that falls on it's face. I never felt so cheated by a movie as I did when I left this one. I am willing to testify that this is one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen. I'll give credit to Colin Ferrel and Val Kilmer, I do think they did a fairly good job, but this movie about a great conqueror is undeniably weak. It has the slowest and most exhausting battles sequences, AND THERE'S ONLY TWO! A movie about a warrior and it has only two battles in it that aren't worth a grain of salt. For as many people that chastise Michael Bay, he could have made this movie something interesting. I mean Stone didn't seem to care too much about audience interest in the story, so we might as well have some good action in this film. Stone seemed to want to beat it in your mind so that'll you never forget that Alexander was gay. We understand this when we see Alex's eyes following the men and how close he is to Jared Leto's character but that's enough. It was like every other seen involved some sort of homosexual activity. Stone wondered astray with this movie, losing sight of what Akexander was historically (in the sense). Don't wast your time. Alexander is nothing more than a 3 hour snuff film that is as exciting as watching a worm and a snail race. My apologies to anyone who likes this film."
"esposit","7","10","17","16 January 2005"," how Alexander conquered the known world while facing different phases in his life
","Finally I saw this movie! After all that talking and controversy about it, I became more and more curious about what this talking all about. I must say that I've seen better epic movies ... even Troy was better! However I give this movie a 7 out of 10 ... It's not that bad but it could have been done much better. Firstly: I cannot understand why there was all that talking about Alexander's sexuality and the 'gay scenes' that there were supposed to be. There wasn't a big deal really! It's true that there is a lot of flirting between guys but only one kiss was seen in the movie that of Alexander (Farrell) kissing a young male dancer. The sex scene with Alexander's wife was by far more explicit when compared. I think and agree that the movie is historically accurate and that Alexander was bisexual. Sexuality was not an issue at those days so men were more free to do whatever they wanted to. Homosexuality was not a taboo!!! I admire Farrell for taking such roles ... it wasn't the first time that we saw him as a bisexual (A home a the end of the world). He is known to be some kind of a playboy so pretending to be the opposite in movies might be hard and it shows good acting. Acting means showing feelings that you don't really feel, and I think that Farrell and Leto did a great job. The acting of all of them was convincing enough and I think we had some of the greatest performances when compared with their past roles. Jolie was sexy (as always) and she really delivered. Her acting was great as did Hopkins and Kilmer. But flaws are not missing in this movie! Too different accents, Jolie is almost as old as Farrell and she played his mother, Farrell's hair, Leto's excessive make-up (too much eye liner)!!! The fight scenes were great but at first I couldn't understand who was killing who and who was winning ... it wasn't clear at all ... there was so much confusion! And the last thing ... I didn't really fell in love with the characters as we all did in Gladiator! This movie is kind of 'dry' in some aspects. I'm sure it could have been a masterpiece but it has certain things that are really missing. The movie starts with old Ptolomy (Hopkins) narrating the events of Alexander. At first we see the warrior as a young boy which became an obsession to a mother who is a snake fanatic (Jolie), who was also a crazy and cunning woman who desperately wanted her son to become a powerful king, than we meet the king (Kilmer) who was a beast and a drunk who slept with God knows how many women, there was nothing human in him. The movie than focuses on the different relationships of Alexander with his mother, the king, his best friend and lover (Leto), his soldiers when he becomes king after the murder of king philip. We see an Alexander who faces war and its bloody side, the glory of conquering the known world, marriage with a woman he doesn't really love (his true and only love was Hephaistion (Leto)) and betrayal."

","I did not feel any need to comment on this movie for a long time, but after recently checking out Michael Wood's docu, 'In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great', I feel tempted to say a few things... all the people who seem to like this crap-fest seem to be taking the portrayal of Alexander being gay as the reason why most of the viewing public was alienated. HELLOOOOOO.... yes, he was bi-sexual (hell some historians have even suggested he was impotent), had an ambiguous relationship with his mother and his father. Philip himself is supposed to have been assassinated by an ex-lover, and many historians have suggested that Alexander was in on the plot. So let's take a bi-sexual, incestuous, voyeuristic, patricidal drunk with deep personal problems - presumably anyone with that combo could have:<br/><br/>i) inspired other''normal' men through 20,000 miles into numerous wars with vastly different armies (from Darius'forces to the Bactro-Sogdian guerrilla war to the elephant regiments in India), and survived starvation, lack of water, disease, natural calamities in the process<br/><br/>ii) established control (i.e., a Greco-Bactrian empire that lasted 150+ years after his passing) over a region (Afghanistan and the neighbouring countries) that no modern force has been able to do<br/><br/>iii) devised war strategies that are discussed (and even used) in battle till today<br/><br/>iv) inspired legends wherever he passed through that have been remembered 2300 years after his death<br/><br/>And Philip, let's not forget... presumably the transformation of the Macedonian state into the most potent fighting machine of the ancient world within a period of 20 years was achieved through drunken orgies alone?<br/><br/>And finally, the GREAT battle scenes - first of all, let's forget Granicus, Issus, Tyre, Gaza - those didn't exist...<br/><br/>Gaugamela... MVP Alexander does a comfortable canter to the Persian line (the funniest bit is to see Persian infantry matching the speed of the horses... he he) and everyone around Darius just waits, not attacking while a detachment of the enemy is right beside them<br/><br/>Hydaspes (in India) ... no! This is Vietnam with elephants! So what were Napoleon, George Washington and those other generals smoking when they tried to replicate Alexander's outflanking strategy at this battle (his crossing of the river in flood at night to take his enemy by surprise on a RIVER BANK with a beach, not a tropical jungle) in their careers? I mean, all the Macedonians ACTUALLY did was deliver speeches and wait with their spears as the elephants charged at them... the battle was turned when Alex's horse scared one of the elephants! <br/><br/>THIS MOVIE IS DOWNRIGHT INSULTING!!!"

","Why does Hollywood continue to spoil history by injecting it with liberal political themes? Much like the anti-war movies that fail, this movie paints bizarre behavior as acceptable, using snakes and gay attractions. The scenery is fairly good, but the mood of the movie dampens one's enjoyment. The fight between the army of Darius and Alexander goes too fast and seems to slow down only when it wants to show gory killings. The dialog is long and boring, and the push to make homosexual behavior normal and a main theme spoils the glory of Alexander in actual history and in the movie. It is no wonder that one can buy a NEW copy of the movie for about two dollars on the internet; a price that is ten times too high. In one word, the movie is ICKY."

Instead of going to portray a leader, a strong man, a conqueror he makes Collin Farrel (who's not ready for a role that big) whining and whimpering like a sensible homo. It's great to show the Human Side on every figure; but Stone went for a myth, for rumors. Alexander was bisexual and half the movie he flirts with companion Jared Leto.<br/><br/>What a chance to ruin a legend. Then cast a ridiculous make up team, in which the passing of time means nothing to them. Combine battle scenes with a dreadful music, like torturing chellos. Cast also some extras that will laugh during the movie, and make Alexander go for corny, lengthy speeches with no final message but to fill the movie.

"daverynne","1","5","7","21 October 2007"," My god, Oliver stone, what were you thinking!
","I'm watching this film on TV right now, and it's so bad that i felt compelled to look up the review on IMDb rather than continue to be tortured by this awful awful production.<br/><br/>Firstly, Why do so many people give this 8-10 stars? I am seriously confused. Do you people like long winded pointless diamonologue? Do you guys watch movies to be bored to tears? Why does everyone have an Irish accent???? (except for Angelina Jolie who performs the token European twang) I know there are some Irish actors in there (Mick Lally, Milie from ""Glenroe"" take a bow) but I'm pretty certain that Val Kilmer doesn't hail from south county Dublin.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are amongst the worst I have ever seen. They make no sense. There are scenes where the cavalry are charging relentlessly towards the enemy (in the distance) but in the close up shots there are infantry keeping pace with the horses on foot. How fast can these Macedonians run? When the armies eventually meet each other it is almost impossible to figure out who is fighting who, which side is winning, or even follow individual soldiers through battle. After the first big mêlée I, and everyone else in the room were confused about who actually won the fight, and we certainly didn't know how exactly Alexander managed to defeat an army more than 6 times as strong as his.<br/><br/>How can any film have so much talking with such a bland story? Oliver Stone's direction is to blame here. Every single scene is over directed and over acted. There is no light relief to be found anywhere in this 3 hour long film. Its just overly serious scene after overly serious scene.<br/><br/>The only slightly humorous scene in the whole film is where they encounter the monkeys, and that is a sideshow less than 30 seconds long, and barely raises a smirk.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the narrator, the story would make absolutely no sense. It gets so bad that all of the story is told by the narrator. The bits when the actors do any speaking are just filling in the exaggerated and unrealistic emotion (always sombre and overblown)"
"bob the moo","Null","5","7","4 September 2007"," Director's Cut: Not as bad as everyone says but certainly flawed across too many aspects
","The story of Alexander the great, the King of Macedonia who sweep across much of the world as it was known at the time. With flashbacks to his relationship with his father King Philip and mother Olympias, we follow Alexander as a boy taught by Aristotle and his rise to power and first conquers all of Persia before moving eastward into deeper Asia as he attempts to reach the Ocean to return to Macedonia. However this road is tough and his men struggle with his methods of ruling his conquered territories and with the seemingly never-ending quest.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this was slated (maybe because it was slated) I decided to give a try for myself. The only option available to me for rental was the slightly shorter Director's Cut, so I took that one and my comments are based around that  how different it is from the original release into cinemas I'm unsure but it was what I had. Taking the eagle of the early scenes as my guide and looking at film from a great height, it is actually not too bad. Cosmetically it all looks good with lots of money spent on the CGI, the battle scenes, the cast, the costumes and so on. However the reality is that every audience must watch this scene by scene and deal with it line by line and it is at this level where the film doesn't really work.<br/><br/>To give it its dues though, the overall sweep is good and the battle scenes are impressive even to this post-Lord of the Rings viewer and it is fair to say that the money is right up on there on the screen. Talk about the narrative, the script, the performances, the delivery though and it is a different story. Whether the story is historically accurate or not I cannot say but, like with many of these things, I am happy to take the overall story as reasonably educational while also recognising that much of it will have been either made up for the sake of the telling or simplified for the same reason. The problem for me was not with the accuracy but more with the script. It is written like speeches rather than conversations; nobody seems to talk so much as proclaim. This makes the characters harder to get into and comes over like the writers were forcing themes rather than building them into their characters.<br/><br/>I actually liked the flashback structure as it gave us both elements of Alexander building towards the conclusion of the film. That said though, it is a bit laboured at times and not every timeshift works as well as it should have done or contributes as much as I suspect it was supposed to. Stone's direction is impressive in regards the battle scenes but it is as writer and deliverer of the story that he falls down; even his ""cut"" contains structural problems and failings.<br/><br/>Without a good script the starry cast mostly struggle. It doesn't help that the themes are mostly handed to the cast in clumps rather than being woven into the dialogue and the characters. Unlike many reviewers I didn't really mind the use of Irish accents; it was a bit funny at first but I got used to the device of the accents representing a certain people. Farrell is left exposed by his director. I do not mean the shot of his balls but more the fact that he seems rudderless in his performance, never being consistent and swinging wildly with each scene. It doesn't help that each line he says is delivered like it is ""the most important thing ever""  with this in mind I didn't care what he looked like, it was more fundamental issues I had with him. Leto, Meyers, Beattie and others provide unremarkable support but the bigger worry is in the A-list names that misfire. Contrary to what some have said, I thought Jolie did a pretty good job with her manipulative character; it is not her fault that she is too young for the role and I'm not entirely sure why she was cast as I can think of a handful of older actresses who could have risen to the role. More disappointing was Dawson who offers little apart from a nude scene (which is an absurdly comic sex scene in itself). Contrary to what my girlfriend might say, I do think Dawson is a good actress and although the male part of me appreciated seeing her naked, I cannot help but wonder why her real talents were wasted in a role that gave her nothing to work with and very little to do anyway. Hopkins is a good narrator and as a device he holds the film together well. Blessed provides a slice of his usual ham then disappears, Plummer likewise while Kilmer does an OK job as the father of the piece.<br/><br/>Overall then this is not as terrible a film as the critics would have led you to believe but this is not to be confused with me saying that it is ""good"". The overall sweep of the film is OK while technically it is professional and impressive but the script is poor, the characters delivered on a basic ""and here's the theme for this scene"" level, while the performances are either weak or, at best, well-meaning. Like I say it isn't as totally valueless as some have claimed but what potential there is, is mostly missed."

This movie is Queer Eye for that Alexander Guy, they had Alexander and Hephaistion all but pick out china patterns. Hephaistion was his best friend from childhood, not his lover. Alexander III had seven wives and over 10 children. This movie is three hours long and does not cover no where near the story of Alexander III of Macedon. He took a 40k man army and conquered 2/3 of the known world. He won several battles where his army was out numbered by more than 10 to 1.

","I was as pumped to see this movie as anyone when this came out, in spite of the negative reviews. I was thinking it would be a movie like WINDTALKERS, which got totally slammed, but was a fun retread nonetheless if not taken seriously. When I finally got to see it, I found out, yeah... it is a huge mess, and uninteresting as the main actors - Farrell and Jolie, are absolutely dull and out of place. They're akin to casting DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz in GANGS OF NEW YORK. These young hipster actors just don't work in historical epics. Maybe Billy Zane or Christian Bale would work... but no more Orlando Blooms. Who can take these seriously? In 50 years when people look back on this, how is a young Colin Farrell going to stack up against a young Marlon Brando or Richard Burton? Will anyone even remember Farrell? There are diamonds in the rough to be had though... Vangelis's music is among his best in recent years, grand and orchestral tough retaining a little of his trademark soaring synthesizers. It works very well in a period piece. Brian Blessed and Christopher Plummer have welcome (if too brief) cameos... and the scene where Alexander attacks the elephant with his horse (though overblown) works fairly well.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is (to put it in English) utter pap. Stone did such great work with JFK, PLATOON, and arguably NATURAL BORN KILLERS... what happens when you stick him with a lot of great genre actors and Vangelis? How did this go wrong? Oh yeah, Farrell and Jolie... not to mention a mishandled story from page 1. At least they never made the Alexander movie Baz Luhrman was planning for so long to star Leonardo DiCaprio... THAT would have likely been even worse."
"saima_pyke","4","5","7","29 March 2006"," Alexander, a good idea poorly executed
","Alexander had the potential to be one of those sensational epics that explore the nature of a renowned historical figure. Instead it was a mishmash of accents, bad wigs & time jumps which left the audience saying ""wtf?"" OK so Hephaistion was pretty hot, and Angelina Jolie at least made the effort to sound Greek, but we have no idea why Val Kilmer felt that King Phillip needed to be Scottish for this one - was it just an easier accent than Greek? Or was it so he sounded more like the rest of the apparently Irish/Scottish/English ""Macedonian"" army? I swear one of these men said ""Aye"" with a decidedly Scottish brogue in the middle of an important speech and said he wanted to go ""Haeme"" (Or Home, for those of us who aren't from the Northern portion of the United Kingdom). It seemed very much that huge and important chunks of the Alexander story were jumped over and the film relied heavily on historical knowledge that some people just don't have to fill the gaps. On the up side, I think the way Alexander's relationship with his friend Hephaiston was handled did not warrant the public uproar that it received. What is more, some of the sets were truly beautiful, particularly Babylon, and it was great to have something so lovely to look at while trying to figure out what was going on and whether Alexander was secretly Irish. Our recommendation - don't see Alexander unless you like watching long, apparently pointless, battle scenes with motivational speeches that make you wonder when Alexander is just going to come out with ""They may take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOOOMMMM!"""
"windypoplar","4","5","7","18 August 2005"," Alexander the great?
","A historical epic like Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"", depends on its lead actor. Colin Farrel was just a complete mistake! His Irish accent, too obviously bleached blonde hair, it really killed the film. Angelina Jolie, one of my favourite actresses, fares no better, why on earth does she sound like a Russian countess! The film has its moments, but the miscasting brings it down.<br/><br/>The entry into Bablyon is magnificent and the last battle in India is right up there with Stone's best stuff, but it cannot make up for the terrible acting of the leads. Only Val Kilmer came off well here. Vangelis' score is evocative and moving and the photography is first rate. Why after seeing the dailies didn't Stone realize how wrong Farrel and Jolie were? He has enough clout to recast his movie even once its in production. A real shame as Alexander is a fascinating figure. Even the slow-moving '55 version with Richard Burton is better entertainment than this. The cast just bombs out here, even Rosario Dawson, usually excellent, is supporting a mysterious accent that makes her unintelligible. The best acting was done by Alexander's horse Bucephaelus! A real shame, don't torture yourself, rent ""Troy"" instead."

","The casting of Colin Farrell as Alexander was one of the all time goofs in movie casting. He could not even suppress his Irish accent for all his dialog. He looked so out of place in this role. The movie trailers lead you to believe this was an action movie depicting Alexander's march across the known world and beyond. Unfortunately, we saw most of the action scenes in the trailer. I've never had to endure so much boring endless dialog in my life. What did the Director's Cut add...more boring dialog. And how about those stupid flash backs repeating almost the same boring dialog between Alexander and his ""crazy"" mother, another miscasting with Angelina Jole. I had to pause this movie 3 times and rest before I could go on watching it, hoping it would have some redeeming quality by the end. It did not. I'm just really grateful I did not go see this bomb at the movie theater. There is no way I could have endured this tripe and would have left.

"bilcal7-1","Null","5","7","4 December 2004"," Typical Good and Bad.
","First off, I just have to say, I am still undecided whether I really liked this movie or not, so making judgments from this review would be futile...anyhoo.<br/><br/>This was Oliver Stone's 21st work as a director and 22nd as a writer. Some parallels can be made to his previous work, in particular, Scarface. Tony Montana was not unlike Alexander. Both came from rough backgrounds, and both grew to hold dominating, yet dangerous power. But that is another discussion. As for Alexander...<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, overall, but it is not a flick I would take my friends out to for a good guy movie....The battle scenes were few and far apart, and Angelina Jolie kept her clothes on. Oh yeah, and that whole homosexuality thing...but we'll get to that later.<br/><br/>I would probably want to take a female to see this movie (Colin Farrel and Jared Leto stole the show). A female that enjoyed movies for their character development and artistry. The film oozed of the former, and had an adequate, but improvable dosage of the latter. There is probably a 50/50 chance I'd see this movie again....here is a breakdown:<br/><br/>It's Strengths: The best (and most numerous) scenes consisted of a two person dialogue, usually involving Alexander. These dialogues were well done and brought a lot of depth to the characters involved. I thought Colin Farrel was fantastic and that he really gave this movie a monkey's chance on a water slide to be any good at all. All eyes were on him and he really performed. As Alexander, he was inspiring and captivating, but not too much so that he seemed super human. Despite supposedly being the son of Zeus, he was still all too human. Flawed, emotional and mortal. As you mythology nerds may know, this is a reoccurring theme in Greek legend.<br/><br/>Another thing, there were a couple good motifs and camera techniques. One was the eagle. The eagle symbolized Alexander's soaring dreams of flying eastward and uniting the people under Greece. During a battle scene, the camera view was from high up above, as if we were the eagle. It then swooped down, getting right in with the action. I thought that was well done, but I think the eagle was a little over-used in the film. Another great shot *spoiler* was when Alexander was facing off with the elephant, the spear going through him, and then the view of him looking up at the sky and blood filtering through the field of vision. This was analogous to the opening of james bond movies and the scene in Hero. You may or may not know what I'm talking about, but anyways, like the eagle, I thought it was well done, but over-used. They continued the battle scene using the red filter. I thought this was good because it showed that, at that moment, everyone else had the same view and vision as Alexander, and would fight to the death to avenge him, but none-the-less, I would have liked it better if they kept the filter exclusive to that one shot of Alexander looking up at the sky and not over-use it. This theme of ""over-using"" segues nicely into..<br/><br/>It's Weaknesses: A series of scenes that, in my opinion, were over-used and only added unnecessary length to the movie, were, what I call, the ""round-table"" scenes. After every area Alexander and his men conquered, they would sit around, drink, and talk about the present situation and what they should do next. Some may argue that this reoccuring scene type showed a great progression of the characters from ambitious, to weary and nostalgic. In case you are confused what i mean by ""reoccuring scenes to show a progression in a character"" a great analogy is in The Shawshank Redemption and the reoccuring event of Red in the parole room. If you are still confused, we can talk later. ANYWAYS, i thought there were enough reoccuring scenes (like the one-on-one dialogues) which provided the character progression aspect I think Stone was going for.<br/><br/>Speaking of beating to death a certain aspect of the film, I have to admit, the homosexuality undertones were laid on a bit too thick. It was slightly distracting and had me thinking, ""What exactly does this mean?"" I thought for a second, maybe Ollie was trying to make some kinda statement against the Bush administration and their policy with same-sex marriage.<br/><br/>Another weakness, is that I thought the score could have been better. I also would have liked to see more Anthony Hopkins, though his role was unique. He played a feeble, and seemingly unimportant man, narrating the story. But it turns out, in his younger days, he was right there next to Alexander.<br/><br/>overall i give it around a 6/10, but like i said, i'm still pretty undecided.."

","Junkfishy mentions one ""flaw"" in the movie being paper which s/he says didn't exist until about 100 or so AD. Hmmmm, if that's so, how does one explain Egyptian papyrus and the Dead Sea Scrolls? Alexander purportedly carried a copy of Homer with him always. I'm sure he wasn't lugging around cuniform tablets! One of the saddest events in history was the destruction of the library at Alexandria--just think of what was lost! To point, perhaps the 10+ years worth of correspondence between Aristotle and Hephastion? <br/><br/>Anyway, I thought that the papers (maps, plans, letters) were one of the finer mundane details in Alexander that attracted my attention and added to the reality of the setting.

But Stone decided the best way to tell Alexander the Great's life was tell, don't show.<br/><br/>No matter want you thought of Stone as a filmmaker and storyteller, his movies never were dull. Even his lesser works, ""U-Turn"" (1997) and ""Any Given Sunday"" (1999) had energy. Not ""Alexander."" Clumsy, overblown and leaden, this three-hour exercise in banal, mind-numbing exposition should have been an exciting and intriguing epic adventure about one of history's most fascinating and enigmatic figures. Instead, it's a tedious, laborious soap opera.<br/><br/>Stone reduces Alexander's exploits to Ptolemy's (Anthony Hopkins) narrations and shows us just two battles - at Guagamela and India. We hear of Alexander's other advances, but see none. The two battles aren't spectacular. They're so disorganized and confusing that Stone relies on Ptolemy to tell us what happened after one battle. When we get to the film's big moment - Alexander facing up to a warring elephant in India - it has no impact because we've lost interest in this clunker. We're then treated to what seems like an acid flashback.<br/><br/>""The film takes a bold, honest look at Alexander's life,"" its Web site boasts. Poppycock. Stone wants to emphasize Alexander's bisexuality, yet doesn't have the guts to give us an honest depiction. The love affair between Alexander (Colin Farrell) loves his commander and childhood friend, Hephaestion (Jared Leto), is limited to laughable glances, an occasional shoulder rub. Give me a break! Not once do these lovers even consider a peck on the cheek. They do hug a lot, though. That's about as bold as Stone gets.<br/><br/>Vangelis' overbearing score gives the film more dramatic weight than it deserves. From its opening - a ""Rosebud""-like moment - ""Alexander"" plods along, never once finding the right mood or tone. The story whizzes all over the place, jumping from one scene to another without clarity or purpose. There's no passion or pathos anywhere. Instead of being touching, a scene where Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer) teaches a young Alexander about Greek legends - Oedipus, Achilles, Prometheus - drags on because neither actor can summon any enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell does not make a convincing Alexander. He's more Alexander the Adorable than Alexander the Great. He whines and mopes rather than inspires and threatens. Though, Alexander never seems to have a bad hair day.<br/><br/>Farrell makes no attempt to hide his Irish brogue and, with an international cast, the smörgåsbord of accents quickly turns absurd. At one point, when Alexander argues with one of his commanders, one actor sounds Irish, the other like Sean Connery. It's priceless.<br/><br/>Farrell's woefully miscast. His Alexander lacks passion. There's no madness to his method. Farrell's limited acting range becomes clearly evident in a scene when Alexander rallies his troops before a battle. Stone means to draw comparisons to Shakespearean Prince Hal's famous battle cry. But watch Farrell fall flat and then go watch Kenneth Branagh's mesmerizing Crispin's Day speech in ""Henry V"" (1989), and you'll realize Farrell's limitations as an actor.<br/><br/>Leto proves yet again what a wooden performer he is. Though, the poor chap's given little to do other than to make goo-goo eyes at Alexander. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers barely registers as Cassander, and Kilmer staggers about as if he's still playing Jim Morrison. <br/><br/>With various accents pummeling the screen, it's surprising Angelina Jolie decided Alexander's mother, Olympias, should have some weird, mock Transylvanian accent. It makes it impossible to take anything she says seriously. Never mind Jolie's just a year younger than Farrell, she never ages even though Alexander, at one point, ages from 4 to 19.<br/><br/>Just when you thought you couldn't hear a more ridiculous accent, along comes Rosario Dawson as Roxanne, Alexander's Bactrian wife. The first time we hear Roxanne speak, she stumbles on to a ""tender"" moment between Alexander and Hephaestion - they're about to hug, again - glares at Alexander and asks, ""You luvf heem?"" These women's accents make Kate Beckinsale's preposterous Eastern European tone in ""Van Helsing"" seem genuine.<br/><br/>If a silly accent wasn't embarrassing enough, poor Dawson then engages in a love scene where Alexander actually growls. At least, she looks magnificent in the nude. Too bad there wasn't more of that and less of everything else.<br/><br/>Of course, no Oliver Stone film would be complete without conspiracy theories and allusions to contemporary politics. Alexander conquers Persia, part of which is now modern Iraq, because, he says, people want change and to live free. There's also mention - because showing us would make sense - of a guerrilla war the Persians waged after Alexander took Babylon.<br/><br/>The film's packed with so many pointless scenes you wonder if Stone left anything on the cutting room floor. There's an unbearably long, terribly written shouting match between Alexander and Cleitus, needless cuts back to an older Ptolemy and a superfluous moment involving Aristotle (Christopher Plummer).<br/><br/>A prime example of Hollywood excess, this dud cost $150 million. Just think of how many wonderful, worthy smaller-budget films could have been made, instead. And don't tell me there aren't countless terrific scripts floating around Hollywood not being read because the writers don't have the right connections.<br/><br/>Greeks shouldn't be upset that Stone depicted Alexander as bisexual. They should be outraged he turned Alexander into a gargantuan bore."
"justiceforall","7","15","28","9 January 2005"," Both brilliant and flawed,
","Went to see this yesterday (8th Jan), and I have to admit i thought it was pretty darn good (although the other 7 people I was with hated it). The film really is an epic, and on the big screen it looked fantastic, especially during a sequence where we see a battle from the perspective of an eagle flying overhead. However, for a long movie it was far too slow, and I felt that better editing could have speeded it up and made it just that little bit more interesting.<br/><br/>PLUS POINTS: Battles were extremely gory, and very intense (worked wonderfully); beautiful score by Vangelis; looks fantastic, CGI used well (and I'm not a fan of it); emotionally intense (found my heart beating really fast by the end).<br/><br/>NEGATIVE POINTS: too slow; variable acting (especially on the accent front); too much Anthony Hopkins; rather pompous in places; too long (even though the director's cut is supposedly 4 hours!!!!!); not really any point to the whole film, and that probably is its downfall.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's prepared to put a bit of time and effort into watching it. However, I think this post-Gladiator slew of historical epics needs to come to an end. You will never better Gladiator, so STOP TRYING! But, all the same, well done Mr Stone."
"du_man","2","9","15","8 February 2006"," In 12 words or less: It sucked. A lot. And I mean it really, really, really sucked.
","* The is a great story. Alexander's story is a truly stunning, epic, and powerful story. Unfortunately, Stone completely screws it up.<br/><br/>First, he makes the character of Alexander into a whiny, annoying, wussy, pathetic, unsure, and gay. Okay, there is no way on earth that the guy represented in the first five of that list was the guy who conquered the world. It's so completely and utterly unbelievable that you are never convinced or even interested by his character, just annoyed and bored. As for the last one, well --- it may or may not be true (there's no direct evidence that he was in real life, but no reason he wasn't), but it isn't interesting. I mean, seriously, so what? Who cares if he's gay? All Stone accomplished by emphasizing that was making a portion of the audience (including myself) uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Additionally, his writing absolutely sucks everywhere else. The dialogue is absolutely awful. I mean, seriously, I can't think of a movie offhand with worse dialogue. Not only is it either cringe-inducing, boring, or hilariously bad (and mostly just the first two), but it doesn't accomplish much. Character-wise, the tragic flaws of Alexander are incredibly over-explained, while his good parts are completely unexplained and, in fact, don't make sense at all.<br/><br/>And Stone's direction stinks. Every now and then he does a halfway decent job with the spectacle, but that's all he gets right. This is poorly filmed and either fake-looking or unenergetic, depending on the scene.<br/><br/>I don't know whether it was as a writer or director he made this decision, but whatever he was thinking, it was dead wrong: he decided to put the movie totally out of order, like Pulp Fiction or something. Now, when used for a reason, this is a good device. However, here, it seems like Stone just randomly cut it into pieces and threw them back together. This means that on those rare occasions when Stone actually pulls everything together and you start to get involved, suddenly you're thrown completely out as it flies to some other time and place, and it's all lost. The movie has no momentum because of this and Stone's inability to give it any path to follow, just throwing random scenes in, so you aren't awaiting anything or even interested, and it becomes completely and utterly boring.<br/><br/>The cast doesn't do much to help. Farrell is miscast, at least for what Stone does (and maybe for a good version of Alexander, but it's hard to say). He is never convincing and almost always wooden, although this has a lot to do with what he's been given.<br/><br/>As for the others, well the usually brilliant Kilmer tries hard, and is really good when either his dialogue isn't so awful he can't find a single way of making it work, or he pointlessly attempts an Irish accent. Jolie is incredibly over-the-top and absolutely ludicrus, with the corniest Russian accent in history. (Russian?!) However, it's over-the-top in a fun way, so it doesn't destroy the movie because it's actually halfway entertaining. (almost as entertaining as how incredibly fake her old-age makeup looks) Plummer is good, but barely in it. Leto is a good actor who does absolutely everything he can in one of the crappiest roles in film history. Basically, Stone tells him to look at Alexander longingly and um, other stuff like that. He tries, but his dialogue is the worst of the film. Dawson is awesome (and not just in the looks department), but after her first ten minutes or so of screen time, basically disappears and occasionally reappears as a background object, and is greatly missed when she's offscreen. And, finally, you have Anthony Hopkins, who does the most shocking thing he's done in his entire career: he actually manages to give a wooden performance. No other cast member is worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Even the battle scenes aren't so great. There are really only two, Guatema (the final showdown between the Greeks and Persians), and some battle in India. The former is certainly big, with lots of impressive special effects, but has no good buildup, and consequently no satisfaction or reason to care. It's also poorly filmed, with a pointless ultra-shaky camera and some very cheap looking shots. The latter has some great moments and is almost a brilliant battle scene, but misses the mark because after the cool slow-motion charge/elephant rearing/horse dying part, which really rocks, it shows everything through a very distracting red filter that makes it confusing when it should be dramatic.<br/><br/>The 155 million dollars they wasted on this mess occasionally did show up, though. The special effects were usually convincing, the sets were big albeit kind of silly at times, and the costumes looked kind of authentic; all of this recreates the ancient world spectacularly, albeit unconvincingly. Vangelis' score has some absolutely wonderful moments, but also falls prey to the general suckage most of the time. While romance between Alexander and Haphestian is indescribably corny, there are genuine sparks between Alexander and Roxanne, begging the question once again: why on earth did Stone make Alexander gay? Also on the upside, besides some decent technical achievements, a few moments were very good, and, to give Stone credit, he did take a very ambitious look at an ambitious topic. However, any movie this boring, pointless, meandering, poorly written, and badly directed deserves to be ridiculed by the critics and lose an inordinate amount of money.<br/><br/>Let me wrap up by telling the films biggest failure: it never adequately explains why Alexander wanted to conquer the world and then succeeded at conquering the world and why he's called Alexander the Great. If you can't even tell why a person got his nickname, you have failed at creating a good biopic.<br/><br/>The sad thing is, big, sweeping epics are my absolute favorite kind of film. Of all people, I should have really found lots of redeeming things."
"Argead","1","9","15","22 November 2004"," Save Your Dinars
","Whoever advised Stone on this film and helped him write the script should be shot, dismembered and the pieces thereof should be burned and buried in separate locations. Historically it's so paint by numbers that it's childish. The stories at Sunday School were more sophisticated.<br/><br/>You'd think there would be some spark in his ""gay"" affair with Hephaeston. But, the homo side is so campy it feels like a ""Carry On"" film. The movie is all blood and talk, with precious little to drive the plot forward. The music is loud and clumsy and signals every important event.<br/><br/>There is so much political correctness permeating the script it's as though a fog has descended on the film. You never get any sense of who Alexander and his Macedonians were. Did I mention the dialogue was lame.

"vipergta4","9","18","35","9 January 2005"," I have seen many epic's in my time............but only one colossus
","The one-dimensional (mostly American) view on this film aside, this film is not breath-taking, it isn't inspiring and it isn't beautiful to look at. What it is however is the strongest, heartfelt look at a land that time forgot. About a man who was so ahead of his time that he was frightened to discover the depths of his ambition. I went to see this film early in the morning so there was only one other guy in the cinema. I couldn't see other peoples reactions so it was all about me and the film. Val Kilmer is captivating, Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing and Colin Farrell.......Colin brings out such grand feelings and emotions , that I'm sure he's never actually felt on such a scale, out of nowhere its hard to believe that he hasn't killed thousands of men and gone to the ends of the earth. Its true he brings the 21st century wild boy image to the role(and it was easy to see that at times he felt over-awed by the scale of the film) but nevertheless being 16 myself in our era i would have it no other way. That raw intensity that young men feel nowadays is essential to such a gigantic role. The story packs so much history and love into its 2 hours and 55 minutes that i never felt bored...EVER. Most of time when colin cries you cant help but well up too. Everyone thought Gaugemela was great (which is was) but i loved the guerrilla sequence that the second battle brought with its erratic battling, shifted color scenes which were simply cool and of course the grand face/off between Alexander and Bucephalus and the Indian king and his elephant, its simply magnificent with the big animal noises, direction and grandeur. I know I've concentrated more on the character of Alexander himself rather than anything else but thats what i thought made the movie myself. I wont address the bisexuality thing, to me i didn't know what the big American deal was about it, a few hugs and a kiss pssshhh whats the deal? i thought there wasn't enough myself and there's not a gay bone in my body. Iwant this film to go well but sooner or later in years to come it will be recognized for WA t it truly is a, which is simply a massive canvas of historical art, and Stone has the paint brush splashing reds, blues, yellows etc.. wherever he like creating a masterpiece, bravo Oliver! I guess to all you other you have to want to know about the man, to appreciate the film!!"
"CinemaBrit@aol.com","10","18","35","8 January 2005"," A stunning work on a difficult subject
","Despite the huge budget and tremendous scope of Oliver Stone's labour of love, he has crafted a film that will be of interest only to a specific audience. There is a stubborn passion for his subject that precludes an audience unwilling to share it.<br/><br/>The wonderful film-making quote ""a hundred patrons will see the same film a hundred different ways"" is particularly pertinent here, as out of those hundred, I suspect only a handful will see 'Alexander' close to the way the director intended. Put simply, it's a historical figure brought to life as accurately as dramatisation allows, and those who don't care to spend time with Stone's deeply flawed, legendary conquerer, or wish to consider the (un-Hollywood) nature of what made him 'Great', are likely to be bored for three interminable hours.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be wholly engaging. Incredible battles aside (of which there are two: visceral and brutal), the performances of Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer are larger-than-life and memorable, the narration by Anthony Hopkins (as Ptolemy) compelling and the visuals nothing short of stunning. I would say one has to be interested in the subject beforehand to properly enjoy Stone's interpretation, but as a screenplay it is both penetrating and eloquent.<br/><br/>And lastly, Colin Farrell as 'Alexander' puts every last ounce of passion and skill into his portrayal. Despite what many have said, he is to my mind the only actor of his age possessing the mercurial quality required to play a man of such extreme contradictions. He is terrific in a phenomenally difficult role.<br/><br/>The makers of this film should be proud. At a time in which people seem to have declared the end of the 'historical epic' cycle, what a shame that America's maverick has suffered the backlash of modern critics' obsession with the here and now. As if a depiction of ancient times needs first to be processed through our trite and brittle sensibilities.<br/><br/>""Fortune favous the bold."" 'Alexander' is the cruel exception. *****"
"PassionObsession","1","8","13","12 May 2006"," Completely and Utterly Awful
","First off, let me say that I just went through the entire process of registering at IMDb simply to comment on how bad I thought this movie was and how strongly I disagree with the other reviewer.<br/><br/>I am an avid Alexander the Great fan, and was looking forward to this movie a great deal and thus was even more disappointed with the way it turned out. Alexander was a man with quite a few psychoses, for sure, but he was an incredibly strong character, with a clear vision of what he wanted and how to get it. This movie, where he cries for what seems like hours at a million different places, makes him into a complete pussy (to put it bluntly). It also makes him into a momma's boy as well, with him completely under her thumb. Granted, his mother had a big part in his life, but he certainly wasn't ruled by her wants and needs.<br/><br/>I also disagreed with the way in which the story was told- through Ptolemy's memories. It makes it melodramatic and overdone. Alexander the Great was great- let his own story speak for itself, don't make it seem like his story ended before it even began.<br/><br/>Then there is the sheer cinematography of the film to consider- what the hell was up with so much slow motion? And the colors? And the fact that Alexander was always always clean-shaven yet is shown with scruff? He was fearless in battle, and inspired others to that same level, not that hysterical wimp trying to hack people up displayed in the movie.<br/><br/>Enough. If I kept going with my criticism it would take me an hour and would be a waste of my time, just as this movie was a waste. Do me, and yourselves, a favor and please refrain from seeing this 175 minute monstrosity."

Collin Ferrel gave on of the worst performances of his career. he was unconvincing. the rest of the movie dragged and i lost interest. don't waste any money on this film. avoid it at all costs."
"picturetaker","2","8","13","2 December 2005"," Terrible Disappointment! Critics were right!
","My Review for Alexander may seem harsh to some and may seem gentle to others but this is my opinion of this movie.<br/><br/>IT STINKS!!! <br/><br/>Visually it was fantastic, at times it left me actually believing that they were filmed in Babylon, well except for the fact it was destroyed and it was computer simulation. The story wasn't too bad either, for being fictitious about Alexander the great. Well except for one thing The thing I could not accept or get past, the thing that bothered me was the on going romance between Alexander and Hephaistion. It was very out of place for a male loving male romance. Seeing that Alexander the movie was supposed to be a big historic epic with lots of battles, aka a guy movie with some eye candy for their dates. Like Troy, Gladiator or Braveheart.<br/><br/>Because of this romance between the two guys it often left me feeling very uncomfortable to the point the rest of the movie was missed. Although there maybe is 5 or 10 minutes max of this romance and only one part where they got into bed with each other (Thankfully no detail!) those few minutes ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>I bought this movie on DVD to see if what was said was true about it. That maybe it wasn't as bad as people said. However when I was finished watching this movie all I could think was ""WHAT WAS OLIVER STONE THINKING!"" He basically ruined a great movie by adding something that did not need to be added to this movie and what's worse something that wasn't even true.<br/><br/>Visually it was great! But the male romance in it was more than I needed in a movie of this type. Too bad because I was so hoping that the critics were wrong. Glad I only paid $12.00 CAD for it."

When I saw Troy I thought the film makers had done a horrible job of translating brilliant source material and ended up with a movie that was bland and uninteresting at its best and at its worst just plain stupid...What Oliver Stone did, though, set a new low for doing a crap job. Alexander the great was THE WARLORD. I mean the man laid siege to a walled island for the love of monkey! This film, however, didn't show that. Instead they decided ""Why spend time exploring this man's drive and conquest when we can look at his intra-personal relationships?"" Rather than being Braveheart on Testosterone like it should have been, it was a cross between Queer as Folk, General Hospital and something else stupid with a couple of poorly shot battle scenes thrown in to the mix. And let's not even mention the acting...At least we now know for sure that Colin Farrel CANNOT ACT!!!! A few years ago I spewed hatred at a film called a House Without a Christmas Tree, according to my Aunt my remarks killed Jason Robards. I can only hope that Colin Farrel and Oliver Stone will now feel the wrath of my words! Currently I am trying to decide which crappy film I consider the worst of all time.

It is pleasing to the eye in terms of costume, location, battle scenes and the presence of the old great actors in all too short roles. But, and it is a big but, the dialogue! Whoever sanctioned the script by Stone/Kyle and Kalogridis should be shot! The script bears a resemblance to that parlour game where someone writes a sentence, hides it, passes it on to someone else for another sentence, hides it, passes it on.....and the resulting story is, well, need I say more?

"sicboi81","1","8","13","5 May 2005"," An Epic Waste of Film
","Oliver Stone seems to have had a dilemma in telling the story of the life of Alexander the Great: Make it historically accurate or insult the audiences' intelligence. He opts for the latter. If I had had no prior knowledge of the life of Alexander, I might have been mildly entertained. What Stone opts to do is to gloss over, or completely eschew almost all of the important, historical military achievements of Alexander in favor of an fictional, ham-handed back story emphasizing his ambitious mother. Stone has a way of beating a point into the ground and he does that here. Angelina Jolie is horrific in this role (everyone else who is supposed to be Greek speaks with a British accent, except for her, who fails at a terrible Greek approximation plus she can't be that much older than Colin Farell to make the mother/son relationship remotely believable). I had to fight back the urge to jump through the screen and choke the living daylights out of her she's so abominable in this role. Otherwise, Stone apparently thought it would be too much for American viewers if Alex was both a great military commander and a homosexual, so he made him a homosexual who, incidentally, commands an army. There are two battles scenes in a movie about a man who spent his entire adult life conquering all the known land east of the Aegean. The acting is uninspired and actually angered me. This is an epic stinker in the vein of Ben Hur and Moses. Only having Charlton Heston in this movie could have made it worse. This movie was simply egregious."
"flashbeagle","3","8","13","1 March 2005"," Very disappointing....especially for those of us who share the name.
","Ever since 2001's Gladiator, America has been in love with the epic historical movie. Unfortunately, there haven't been many good ones. The newest of these epic movies is Oliver Stone's tale of Alexander the Great.<br/><br/>Alexander is the tale of the great Macedonian king and one of the greatest military leaders in history as he conquers much of the known world of the time. We see his passion for continuing the kingdom that his father began and his never ending battle to become the greatest ruler in the world.<br/><br/>Now, all my life, in school, it was always ""Alexander The Great? That's my name too!"" So you'll understand that I really wanted to like this movie. We have the same name. And the name is quite a kickin one. So I tried to like this movie, I really did. But I just couldn't.<br/><br/>First off, ill get this out of the way; the movie was very well made. The cinematography throughout the film was beautiful. And the movie as a whole was very well made. It being directed by oliver stone, I didn't really expect anything less. The movie also had 2 of the coolest battle scenes that I've seen lately in such films. However, unfortunately, there are only 2 battle scenes in the movie, much less than what I expected to see in a movie about one of the greatest conquerors and battlers in history. So, to recap, Alexander had beautiful cinematography and was very well made, however, unfortunately, it didn't have the actual movie to back it up.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was sub-par at best. Colin Ferrall does an alright job as Alexander, but just alright. So too is Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother, Olympius. I'd have to say that the best acting job in the movie would have to go to Val Kilmer for his portrayal of Alexander's father King Philip.<br/><br/>The entire course of this film was just hard to sit through. First off, the film just refused to end. At about three hours, the film dragged at several parts. There were about 18 endings, 17 of which were not actually the ending. The first 10 or so minutes felt like I was in history class as an old Ptolemy, played by Anthony Hopkins talked. That's it, just talked. Nothing else was happening. I couldn't understand why someone would desire to sit through that. The narration throughout the movie by Anthony Hopkins got to be rather annoying and too school like. Worse of all was the fact that half of what he was saying, most of the smartest members of the audience wouldn't have a clue who or what he was talking about.<br/><br/>There has been much talk about Oliver Stone's decision to portray Alexander as Bisexual. While, I don't know if that's historically accurate, I don't believe that it should have been as much of a focal point in the movie as it was made. The homosexual undertones were brought to the forefront of the film too often. Its something, that even if true, isn't what the story of Alexander the great should be about. Also very troubling is the fact that none of the characters were consistent. A movie that has its characters all originating from the Greece, had people talking with English and Scottish accents, nothing near Grecian. Most peculiar of all was Angelina Jolie's portrayal of Olympius as a Dracula. She maintained a good Transylvanian accent throughout the film. I guess Oliver figured that if Alexander could have gay tendencies, his mother could have blood sucking ones.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's Alexander is a very disappointing movie, especially to those of us named Alexander. While it has some beautiful shots and is appears beautiful, there is no substance to fill it up. I suggest you skip out and wait for it to come out on DVD if you really must see this, even for those die hard Colin fans. I think you die hard battle between horse and elephant fans can wait too. Alexander gives Alexander 2 stars out of 5."

The movie really left me unsatisfied! This might just be the kind of movies that will give todays youth a wrong idea of history.<br/><br/>OK there was much aspect for the psychology of Alexander and the reasons that have driven him to act in certain ways. But still, for a movie that long, they might have mentioned the other aspects of the 'heroes' life.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad. Even OK. But I must admit that i had expected more from the director. Oliver Stone brought us masterpieces, but Alexander is a mistake that we must forget and forgive. Maybe the cast, legend and director, raised the expectations so high that the movie can't realize.

","Horrible. The content could have been really interesting. The direction and acting drove this movie into the ground. Some points to ponder: - I didn't know all Greeks are Irish. - The structure of the film was confused. The pattern of the movie was set early: each 'act' was announced with a subtitle saying 'N year's later' and a long, boring sequence followed. Then, about 2 hours in and for no reason I can understand, there is a flashback to an important event in Alexander's life; the subtitle says '8 years earlier' or some such. What happened? No dramatic tension was created. Terrible. - I didn't know Alexander's mother was Elvira's little sister. - The Greeks believed that what we classify as homosexuality was one of the expressions of love. Since they also believed that women were inferior, the logical conclusion is that the best love one can have is between fellow men. Fine - I don't really care one way or another. The thing is , they were men who loved men for being men, not for dressing up like women and acting like women. Alexander's love for his friend struck a sour chord throughout the show. - Staring with anguish at the camera is not the same as having the intensity of purpose that Alexander must have had.<br/><br/>As I post this, the user rating is 5.5 I'm shocked. This is far and away the worst movie I've ever seen - though I did miss Battlefield earth."

","SPOILERS? It's history, it was real, read it from the books...<br/><br/>Society changes over time. What once was good, might be bad in the future; people always change their minds, about how the world should be. Homosexuality for example. Ancient male greeks used to ponder it, not everyone was gay; in fact they were bisexual (They had wives and children)but what was really appreciated was a long enduring relationship with a man. I have nothing against bisexual, homosexual or lesbian people; it's a subjective matter, and you can't judge a think like that because it depends of the person. In Alexander homos are everywhere, but I think is an overexploited subject that makes the movie a shallow pseudo-biography of one of the greatest generals ever alive. His grand achievement was to conquer almost all the world, not having sex with very thing that he encounter on his way. He fought magnificent battles with a superb ability to make intelligent moves on the battlefield. However tough it was disgusting whenever stone placed for a long time gay scenes(the persian he found was just TOO much)I don't hate gay people (I'm a fan of Judas Priest and Rob Halford, a confessed gay, is to me the best singer on earth; I think he is cool), I hate watching gay innuendos and kisses between men. Probably Stone tried to be polemic, but with a pointless thing. Focusing a biography in parts that could have also been included in a Truman Capote biography make out of Alexander a mediocre film. The man RULE the world, I mean place what actually cares. Battles were fine but the part that really caught me was at the near end, when Ptolemy (well played by Hopkins) regretted his last comment when teaching to his students; he lamented that they (Alex's generals) lack the vision Alexander had, as if he was telling us that short vision men ended a great man's desire, a man who care for something else than just a home with a family, mortal men desires: A man willing to be something else than the rest, a man who wanted to become immortal by becoming a god."

","I went to see Alexander with two of my friends. I was a little excited to see it because first of all it is an Oliver Stone film and secondly I thought that movie had a good ensemble cast. Half-way through the movie I wanted to get up and walk out. I didn't care if it had homosexuality in the film. Honestly, I felt sorry for Alexander that he couldn't be with the person that he loved. I was just bored to death. The story of Alexander is just too great that it really should have been a series or something not a boring three hour movie. The scene when he almost died was ridiculous. The coloring of the scene was overdone. Was it supposed to be an art piece or what. It was really just too over the top. The other thing that I didn't understand about this film was what everyone's accents were supposed to be. I mean Val Kilmer had more or less an American accent, Angelina Jolie had I don't know what kind of accent and Colin Ferrel had an Irish accent. At least keep the language true to the time period. The only good thing about this movie is that there is a brief glimpse of a naked Colin Ferrel. All in all I give this movie a 1 out of 10. I will never see this movie ever again."
"votarus4","7","8","13","28 November 2004"," Alexander  an Instant Camp Classic
","Oliver Stone has imagined a vigorous, opulent homage to the Sword and Sandal genre, and like the best of those films of a generation ago, sheer visual style, over-the-top acting, and showmanship win the day. The best of those films-Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Spartacus-also had brilliant scripts, pitting their protagonists in the center of conflicts where superhuman will and wit overcome immense odds. But as history's first and most insatiable conqueror, Alexander seems unchallenged. Mighty ancient cities fall beneath his sword like so much marshmallow, and his one true enemy-Darius, King of Persia-has no words in Stone's film at all!-he's just a face. Thus, without a central conflict to dramatize, Stone's film lowers itself to the Sword and Sandal genre's middle road, where writing takes a back seat, and characters make portentous pronouncements before going off to fulfill their destinies. Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, Alexander's mother, comes off best and worst in Stone's decadent stew. Her unnatural devotion to Alexander seems to inspire the 'You-Must-Conquer-the-Known World' flame, but she's quickly side-lined by the script and is left screaming in the wilderness, having no real effect on the ensuing action. But she looks magnificent, and her face at the moment of Philip of Macedonia's death, is alone worth the price admission. Her Transylvanian accent, however, is a distraction, as are the Irish, English and Scottish dialects of other actors. Stone's script also avoids Alexander's more elaborate military strategies-studied and duplicated for thousands of years-and makes short shrift of the ongoing power struggles he had with his generals. Colin Farrell, as Alexander, works hard and holds the screen for 3 hours with a strange mix of petulance, arrogance and good old fashioned Hollywood charm. He and Jared Leto, as Hephaistion, have a long and tender love scene (fully-clothed) on a Babylonian balcony, looking down on what has to be the most opulent scenery ever devised for a feature film. This is a clear, if telescopic homage to D.W. Griffith's 1916 Masterpiece, 'Intolerance.' All in all, Stone's Alexander is never boring, never brilliant, but always visually exciting. Probably the most gorgeous film made in years. Terrific showmanship. 7/10"
"sheynaa","1","8","13","16 November 2004"," I can't believe this is from the same guy that did Platoon!!
","""Alexander"" is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen. And i've seen a LOT of crappy movies. I went to see it for free at a university; so I expected some level of college-maturity-level-heckling. This movie deserved every last cackle, jeer, moan and groan. Although I can go on for days about all of the problems with this movie, I will only highlight 3:<br/><br/>1. With the exception of Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson (both of whom sounded like they were from Transylvania), everyone had a half-arsed Irish accents. The only logical explanation for this is that Colin Farrell, the title character, could not manage any semblance of a Mediterranean, Greek, or Macedonian accent. (any of them would have been acceptable)<br/><br/>2. At least 45-minutes of the movie was dedicated to homo-erotic-innuendo, which wouldn't have been a problem since Alexander the Great was definitely (or at least) bisexual. However, the way it was done made it look like a mild version of ""Caligula."" I was literally waiting for Colin Farrell to name his horse as his 2nd in command. One would think that the portrayal of such a heroic figure (that was the point, right?) would highlight something like Alexander's sexuality in a respectful manner. It was completely tasteless.<br/><br/>3. The battle scenes terrible, point blank. Yes, I understand the first fight was in the desert, but i would have like to SEE some of it. The so cinematography was so chaotic that you could not follow any Alexander's ""strategic mastery."" And the rally speech was a shameless ""Braveheart"" rip-off.<br/><br/>P.S. What the hell was Collin Farrell's lion growl about in the near-rape seen of his wife?"
"xavierasantiago","2","6","9","8 January 2006"," Brief and unsatisfying
","After watching this film and subsequently reviewing the comments of other members, I have come to agree with a small portion of them. I do appreciate the extent for Hollywood's attempt to recreate a ""Laurence of Arabia"" production, but they lost some aspects historically speaking. However, the most significant problem with this film, like many other films is the authenticity of accents. Not only are they wholly wrong on many levels, but completely inconsistent within a characters development. At times, I felt by listening to the voices that I was in Ireland and others, that I was in Siberia Russia (are they not in Greece and from the same towns in some instances?). It is either this case or the lead actors, who are Irish, and are incapable of changing their accents--thus all other actors had to change theirs.<br/><br/>In any case, if a film maker is going to attempt a film of any historical value, all aspects should be attended to or they will lose authenticity.<br/><br/>Other than that, I appreciated the subject matter and allowed for some historical inaccuracies. Then again, most writers and producers are not historical scholars, but with this budget, keeping one on retainer would not hurt (ahhem...""Mona Lisa Smile"")."

","Finally saw this klunker.<br/><br/>Inviting the ire of knowledgeable film scholars for probably misusing the term, I found the cinematography reminded me of old Harryhousen films ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,"" ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" and ""Clash of the Titans.""<br/><br/>Smarmy like that.<br/><br/>Awful script (did Oliver Stone really write ANY of this?), worse music, hokey cornball acting (although Val Kilmer, as usual, was excellent -- that guy rules)... and, seriously, why does Angelina Jolie use a Russian accent? She sounds like Natasha Badenoff. <br/><br/>And how is she the same age as her son?<br/><br/>Well, at least it's not a remake or a sequel. That's something.<br/><br/>Also, they could have made the whole movie without showing Colin Ferrel's junk, but I guess cooler minds didn't prevail."
"astral707","1","6","9","19 November 2004"," It doesn't get any worse than this
","I was able to see this movie for free the other night, and though I hadn't had any special plans to go see it before, I decided to give it a shot and go. I had no great expectations, really. I thought it would be a blockbuster in the classic sense, in which I'd be fairly entertained either by acting or grand battles or possibly both. I also imagined that it would be heavier in drama than most epics, as the story of Alexander's life isn't all peaches and bunny rabbits. <br/><br/>After seeing it, I wish I had demanded to be paid for the three hours of my life I'll never get back.<br/><br/>Where to start? The dialogue was horrendous. Cut and pasted from the past five plus years worth of films, it was the Frankenstein of epic dramas. For example, rather than Gladiator's line of ""Shadows and dust"" we are treated with ""sun and shadows.""<br/><br/>I was seated in a theater with more than four hundred people, so I know I'm not alone when I say that a majority of the battle scenes, inspiring speeches, and heart wrenching tender moments were outright laughable. The audience cracked up at nearly every important moment in the film, including the imitation Braveheart/Gladiator rallying speech and the various Hephaestion/Alexander moments meant to show us the inner turmoils and fears of the protagonist.<br/><br/>And this doesn't even touch upon the various accents the actors used. I realize the filmmakers were likely trying to make the point that Alexander's army was a mix of different people, including many different kinds of Greeks and Macedonians, by utilizing a variety of types of speech. Still, Irish, Scottish, and English accents accidentally modernized the film and made it even more of a mockery. Angelina Jolie didn't even bother with any of those, but instead opted for an accent so fake that I expected her to list ""Moose and Sqvirrel"" amongst Alexander's enemies.<br/><br/>Since the drama had clearly fallen on its face early in the film, I kept hoping for the battle scenes to redeem it. Once again I was disappointed, to put it VERY lightly. In three hours we're ""rewarded"" with only two major battle scenes, which is odd in itself for a movie about a famous conqueror. The majority of both consist of shaky cameras filled mainly with shots of Alexander's army at extreme close-up, or Alexander in slow motion. Phalanx shots are obscured by layers of dust (if we're not watching their marching feet) while the heart of the chaos is cut too fast to watch any one amazing, or even vaguely interesting, battle between individual opponents. <br/><br/>It cannot be argued that it was merely displaying the chaos of real fighting. A movie should have some narrative thread even in a battle, and the absence of one left me feeling separate, an outsider, rather than engaged in the action. There was no suspense. Battles were outright boring, even when the filmmakers tried to shock the audience with massive amounts of blood.<br/><br/>I don't have to room to point out the problems with the terrible score, nor the almost painful-to-watch acting we were subjected to. And considering just how bad this film was, I think everything I've said so far boarders on being too nice.<br/><br/>I will give the movie credit for only one thing: the scenery in Babylon was pretty neat. And for what he was given, Val Kilmer at least managed to pull out an OK character from the mire of this film."
"batocicero","1","7","11","7 November 2007"," OK, are we talking about Alexander the Great here or a gigolo philosopher?
","WOW, it was a long time since I felt like getting out of the theater as soon as possible and buy a ticket for the next Chucky film! OK, I'm exaggerating, but what is definitely true is that this film was the most boring one I have watched in awhile. Was it really 3 hours? It looked like 10! Boring, boring, BORING.<br/><br/>I'd rather see a ""dumb film"" that entertained me than this monologued crap full of trash philosophy. I couldn't stand the last hour of this thing, and it doesn't happen often, really. Is it true that the director wanted to made this film as historically accurate as possible? Did he even think of the entertainment value? It's so slow-paced and the camera so unsteady that I couldn't even enjoy the battles.<br/><br/>And what about the ""dyed blonde"" Alexander with dark eyebrows? What the HELL was that? Who the HECK thought of portraying him as blonde in the first place? A super-production with such a bad make-up is just offensive, and Collin Farrell is just not up to the task. His ""leadership"" was totally unconvincing, along with an overall bad acting and, yet again, his dyed hair just made me laugh (and all the people that came with me). Ah, and let's not forget the Jolie mother who looks like his younger sister (with dark brown hair????). Collin, stick to the bad boy thingy, please!<br/><br/>If I should know that I would spend 3 hours praying for this mumbo jumbo to end, I should have read a book about the REAL Alexander and actually LEARN something about him.<br/><br/>Nothing else to add.

","Well this movie have pseudo-intellectual options,because everything is around Alexander sexual options and his problems with his family,the action is ultra slow which means the dialogs are dumb useless and sometimes out of the story i mean there isn t any action in this movie.

Colin farrell isn t the man for this i think nobody understands what a small man and very poor actor like him is doing in this film,nobody can see this guy as someone great but only as a supportive character,the man doesn t have talent and charisma for big roles. The sadest part of this film is watch actors like Hopkins or val Kilmer in pain trying to make make a good work and give some soul to the movie,but they failed.This is a very arguable recreation of Alexander life,if you think you can watch an adaptation you are wrong,this doesn t have a script it is an historical work more a documentary concerned in telling us an ultra arguable vision of Alexander personal life forgetting the military part which was the main part of Alexander life because he was a conqueror.Avoid this like plague if you think this is some kind of Braveheart.This isn t a movie."
"bunnystyck","1","7","11","20 March 2006"," From another ""Close Minded American Idiot""
","I've read through quite a lot of comments of this movie, and as per usual to movies of this type, the common feeling seems to be ""if people didn't like it then they were obviously 'ignorant' or 'homophobes'"". While the movie had scenes that would make the ""Average Joe"" squirm awkwardly in their seats, there is more that can be attributed to that reaction then the homosexual erotica.<br/><br/>As you might tell from the low score, I didn't like this movie. Perhaps the only reason why it got such a ""high score"" out of me is because I enjoyed every second Val Kilmer was on screen. He made that movie just a little more bearable. But his talents (as well as the other actors apart of this project) were wasted in a movie that felt more obsessed over artistic, jerky camera angles, muted colors, and taboo subject matter then the actual fascinating life and legends of Alexander the Great.<br/><br/>I went into the movie with high hopes. The trailers looked promising and I believed that the movie was very well cast, but I walked out more disappointed with this movie then I should have been. For a story that should have been treated with a bit more of a linear perspective of Alexander's youth to his death (and everything in between), it hopped around like a suicidal jackrabbit in the middle of the New Jersey turnpike. Changing position without warning and begging for something to quickly put it out of it's misery.<br/><br/>I think a lot of historically significant moments in Alexander's life should have been there, not just because they would have been cool to see, but because I think they help frame his character for the audience to make him more real. Not event the battles that made him legend were treated in any sort of way that would make them understandable. Unless you were a history or war tactics major of some sort, I dun think there was any way of knowing the tactical genius going on through the dust and shaky cameras. And what might have been a memorable and uplifting speech for the first fight in the movie was traded in for a literal bird's eye view that didn't help to further the plot in any way at all.<br/><br/>I'm all for 3 hour movies, but if they *feel* like 3 hours, it's time to get a new editor. Long, drawn out, and uncomfortable dialog accompanied by non linear scenes that stunt any kind of character development is a bit hard on the average movie goer looking for an action packed, historically epic hero's journey.<br/><br/>Atop of those problems, it felt like the director was *aiming* to make his audience uncomfortable. Perhaps it's an artistic attempt to observe people's reactions. But there is a right way and a wrong way to get reactions out of people based on taboo subject matter. Alexander was a wrong way. With the main character as vapid and uninteresting as the plot-less plot, throwing in a couple scenes of hardcore sex and overly suggestive homo-erotica, it begins to feel less like a movie, more like a cheap peepshow. Every single thing felt disjointed, inhuman, and full of void. If you like that kind of thing, more power to you. But I didn't appreciate it.<br/><br/>By the end of it I found myself not caring to know any more about this historical juggernaut. It's sad really. This movie certainly proves that you're better off listening in history class or reading a book to make your own movie in your head, because this movie certainly did not live up to what it had to deliver. If you want to learn about and be amazed by the story of Alexander the Great, read about it, watch documentaries, and maybe there are some worthwhile made for TV movies available. If your looking for an overly and unnecessarily artsy Hollywood film that's supposed to be about Alexander... go right ahead."

","Easily the stupidest, most amateurish film i have ever seen. I only ended up watching it because I was curious to see if it was as bad as its supposed to be, only to find that it was worse.<br/><br/>The films ineptness was actually laugh out loud funny which can't have been its directors intention. The worst thing about the film is undoubtedly beetle-browed Colin Farrel who is totally defeated by his role. Aside from his thick Irish accent and terrible peroxided hair (the worst film hair since Robert Wagner in Prince Valiant) is totally ill equipped to inspire a nation as his character does. Seldom has such a bad actor had to carry a film on his shoulders, though the blame isn't all his, the supporting players are no better.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is perhaps the best and even she is fairly terrible as his mother as is Val Kilmer who hams it up as Alexander's father. Jared Leto is wet as Hephaisten - his death scene is truly hilarious - and one hopes that Christopher Plummer and Anthony Hopkins were not paid too well for their wise old men turns. Rosario Dawson is fine as Alexanders barbarian wife but has little to do as do Jonathan Rys Meyers and Brian Blessed who have brief thankless bit parts.<br/><br/>Aside from the cast the movie's flaws are endless, the costuming looks cheap (even if it wasn't) as do some of the sets and battle scenes, the cinematography is dire too (towards the end of the film everything turns pink for some reason)and the version I watched (directors cut) had many continuity and editing errors. The music too was perpetually irritating, though not as much as the clashing of accents was. The bizarre order in which the events were told didn't help matters nor did the long running symbolic use of snakes and eagles (very g.c.s.e media studies). The homosexual element of the film is handled clumsily, though i suppose its an awkward issue to broach in this type of film with the type of audience it attracts.<br/><br/>Luckily my friend works at a video rental store so I didn't have to pay to watch this awful film, though i can't pretend I didn't slightly enjoy how bad the film was because i did, but i would recommend that you save your money and time and watch something else. Anything else."

","Like TROY, Alexander lacks of historic truth. The bad thing is that he was one of the greatest Leaders of history of mankind and he should be treated like one. If anybody studies a little bit of history he/she will see that homosexuality in ancient times was a part of every day life. Alexander wasn't a homosexual but probably a bi-sexual like everybody that days. For that, the film-makers -because of their need probably to gain the gay-community and of their lack of creativity and talent- shown during the whole film the love between Alexander and Ifaistionas... For that the film should be titled ¨Alexander and Ifaistionas: a fairytale of... great love¨. As far as the battles concerned, apart from the last battle in India (which had some good moments) it was poor. The scenario also was weak having in mind the true history of Alexander which was great and rich and difficult for these filmmakers to reach. As a historian and a Greek i was really disappointed."

What bothers me is the acting, or lack thereof.<br/><br/>None of the actors were any good, and throughout the movie, they consistently spewed out corny lines such as, ""Conquer your fear, and I promise you, you'll conquer death!"" Not to mention, such lines as ""You love him?"" Not only were all of the accents overdone and obnoxious, if they weren't involved in some cliché monologue, they were spewing lame one-liners.<br/><br/>While the action sequences were decent, they were few and far between to justify giving this movie more than one star. It would be one thing if this movie was only one hour and a half, or maybe two hours at most, but this was three hours of brutal overacting. Quite honestly, it was a pain to watch.<br/><br/>Now, onto the matter of the accents. While some people have noted that they would be speaking in Greek, and not in English, this does not change the fact that when Greeks speak English, they talk with a rather noticeable accent. They would not be speaking in an Irish accent, and they wouldn't be speaking in a Russian accent (Angelina Jolie). It wouldn't be too bad, but they were all over the top. The accents helped to make the movie quite tedious.<br/><br/>It's the only movie I've ever seen, that made we want to run out of the theater screaming. It's a movie I would never see again.

","I just finished watching the so-called 'Director's cut' of this film. I have a degree in history and have always been fascinated by Alexander the Great. I have read many books speculating as to who Alexander really was. What an amazing man he must have been. Needless to say I had anticipated this movie for some time.<br/><br/>Boy was I sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell was a complete BUST as Alexander. Smirking at Angelina Jolie while he was delivering his 'son to mother' lines was bad enough. But after listening (and cringing through) his great 'speech' to the troops before Gaugemela, I was surprised that the men didn't retreat in a panic and/or commit wholesale suicide. Farrell is not believable AT ALL as Alexander, nor is he in any way believable as a leader of men. He is simply not a good actor.<br/><br/>This movie is hopelessly schizophrenic about Alexander. Oliver Stone makes Alexander out to be a 'shoot from the seat of the pants' wannabee who runs around the ancient world acting petulantly and disrespecting his colleagues and looking rather childish in nearly every scene he is in. This is then juxtaposed with scenes of Anthony Hopkins blathering on in the library at Alexandria about how incredible Alexander the Great was. Wait a minute. Are we talking about the same guy here? Or is Stone making the brilliant point that reality and myth are not the same? It's almost as if Stone is intentionally TARNISHING Alexander's legacy.<br/><br/>I also must confess that I didn't realize how much eye makeup people wore in the fourth century B.C. Everybody wore a lot! I was also surprised at the lack of dirt on anything in those ancient cities. Spotless. <br/><br/>Did I mention the special effects were poor?<br/><br/>IN SUM: THREE POINTS: Casting Farrell was the kiss of death, but had the movie somehow survived this inexplicable casting decision, the script would surely have killed it, and if the movie somehow lived through those two traumas, then the director's decision to have the Macedonians speak in a Scottish ACCENT (I'm not making this up)would surely have proved fatal.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this piece of rubbish."

","Apart from the very good and gory battle scenes, Alexander bored me senseless. Trying to keep up with Hopkins's ramblings which apparently kept you up to date with the story was too much for me. Why did most of the characters have Irish accents? Presumably because Colin Farrell couldn't do any other accent. Why did Alexander have an Irish accent while his mother sounded eastern European? Perhaps because Angelina Jolie couldn't do an Irish accent. Why did we only see two battles when Alexander fought in over 50? Maybe it was deemed more interesting to focus on half-hearted homosexuality and yawnsome story-telling. All in all it was a tedious three hours that I can't believe I sat through."

The acting on the whole was passable, but I also kept getting distracted by the fact that it seemed like most of Alexanders army and even his father (Val Kilmer; whom I usually adore) for some odd reason all seemed to have Scottish accents.My over all recommendation is to avoid this movie."

","Given the release date, it appeared that there was high confidence in ""Alexander"", however it appears that no one, save for Stone himself, was actually looking at the finished product. The editing was finished mere weeks before the release date, and in hindsight, it seems that a lot of the project was based on blind faith. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone has really fallen off the top, his glory days far behind him. This was an idea that seemed terrific on paper, yet the final movie is awful in execution.<br/><br/>The main problem with the movie is structure, and when a movie exceeds three hours, that is equivalent of a death knell. Overlong, potholed, and disjointed, Alexander stumbles from one scene to another, with no honest sense of direction or pace. In addition, the final scenes seem very tacked on, due to the damaged reels during the initial production stages. Given Oliver Stone's negative attitude towards digital filming, this seems all the more ironic.<br/><br/>The movie does have its strengths, however. The battle scenes are exhilarating, and in a year of disappointments such as ""Troy"" and ""King Arthur"", it's welcoming. The acting isn't quite as bad as many people make it to be, and the score is commendable. Still, ""Alexander"" fails to revive the swords-and-sandals genre.<br/><br/>3/10"

","When I went to watch 'Alexander' I was expecting to see a really bad film. Usually when you expect to see a bad film it turns out to be quite impressive. That was not the case this time. In fact, my disappointment was far bigger than I expected it to be. I decided not to ever comment 'a film like this one' and the only reason I went to see it was because this film was supposed to represent my history and culture.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins had the worst character make up ever! I could not believe that was actually him. I think make-up artistes had quite a fun deciding how many people will have one eye missing because if you did notice; nearly every second actor did not have one. Angelina Jolie did not age in twenty years; all she got was a bit of a grey hair. Colin Farrell had a bleached blonde hair and his dark roots were extremely annoying as the real Alexander was natural blonde I believe and people did not bleach their hair in 323 B.C. I believe that black eyeliner was supposed to make him look exotic I have to admit I was very impressed by the way Persians were presented. The costumes and the interior design of the palace were beautiful. I could not stop laughing when I realised Collin Farrell was using his Irish accent. Why Angelina did not use it as well, instead she tried to sound like Eastern European but it turned out quite poor. If it's too difficult to learn how to speak Macedonian why just don't speak English. Trying to have eastern European accent is worse because people at Alexander's time did not speak English with various accents. <br/><br/>I was quite impressed by camera-work and lighting. The best work in this film did the sound designers and the storyboard artists."

But this, was, corny, fake, terrible, bad, horrible, all blended together with a bad script and a bad movie score.<br/><br/>If a director wants a narrator then have one, Anthony Hopkins part was completely unnecessary. I also think it was miss casted. Why is Alexander's mom like only eleven month's older then him. And I didn't even like the fight scenes, they took too long, and the repeating shot of the eagle. And why was Alexander always lecturing, his long and boring speeches kept coming, and they were about the same friggin' thing. <br/><br/>Also if the writer wants to hint bi-sexuality, then do it, but don't give these boring scenes between two men saying how happy they are to be with each other and then embrace.

","I saw Alexander at a screening last night and it's perfectly awful. There's a historic war and costume epic somewhere smothered under dense declarative text where the actor reads and reads till your eyeballs dry out. A less-is-more attitude in the cutting room would have made this a better filmic experience. Stone planned, shot and edited the great battle sequences crisply, and they are convincing, authentic in feeling and appropriately gory and violent. Other good things: costumes, sets, photography, sweeping scenery, Vangelis music, reliably seamy-faced Brit character actors. But an excess of stagey speechifying dominates the drama. A good cutter would also hack gratuitous folk dancing, Felliniesque orgies, and the endlessly lingering, smoldering, longing gazes by Alexander's pretty boyfriends. OK, boyfriends. Move on. Casting: Colin Farrell is a fun guy but he's no fun at all here. He doesn't have the voice, the physical or psychic presence to command in this epic role. They also couldn't get him a decent peroxide job, and dark roots are a constant distraction. Val Kilmer: lousy role, latexy makeup, costume-shop wig, puffy, too young. He has bad lines and uses them. Angelina Jolie: has the looks to fill Sophia Loren's pouty-lipped, cat-eyed sword-and- sandal position, but instead plays a domineering uber-Jewish mother to Alexander  she would have to be pregnant at 8 to have borne him. Poor Rosario Dawson throws herself physically into her role as Alex's wife, taking this as a serious-actor career boost, and she's gorgeous and pitiable. Her scenes with Farrell are about the best other than the battles  but you know you're going to end up with Angelina soon enough, chewing the paint off the scenery, or gratuitous flying-eagle symbolism, or Anthony Hopkins blathering his way through a history-lesson narration in a tiny garden jammed full of 'Greek-style!' statues that you might find at your local Armstrong Garden Center (I kept looking over Hopkins's shoulder for a St. Francis of Assisi)."

","Alexander was the worst movie I have seen in the theater in a very long time. I was sad and disappointed. I thought this movie would be in league with Troy, not the best movie ever made, but with enough action and beautiful people to make it worth seeing. It was not. It was entirely too long, and I kept waiting for it to get better over the course of 3 hours but it didn't. I only stayed through the entire thing because I had spent $8.50 to see it and I was going to get my money's worth. Colin Farrell was absolutely terrible, crying and yelling and sending smoldering looks to Jared Leto. There is a lot of ""gay"" scenes, but they are historically accurate, he was bisexual. But the scenes aren't titilating or hot, they are just there. Jared Leto telling Colin he loves him, long embraces, smoldering glances, etc. Doesn't live up to the hype. Angelina Jolie was gorgeous, but sounded like she was Count Dracula's girlfriend. The movie had the feel of a PBS special, complete with a British narator. There was no point or reason for the movie, there was no motivation for anything that happened, it just did. Alexander wanted to see all of the known world, but why?! Just because, it seems. Conquered all those people for fun. Colin Farrell didn't make him seem interesting or intelligent or a man of any consequence, just some guy out to conquer the world. The battle scenes were boring and gory. Just a bunch of guys chopping at each other and getting covered in blood. If you are reading this and haven't seen it, don't waist your money!!"

","Just came from seeing the movie with my little daughter. I was, considering the overall demographics of my town, surprised that the theater was full. I feel that although necessary Anthony Hopkins' narrative may have proved to be too long for folks not truly interested in ATG. This can tune folks out.<br/><br/>Hephaistion's character seemed too shadowed. The scenes between Alexander and Hephaistion were wonderfully portrayed. I have to agree Collin Farrel was not the best orator when it came to battle speeches but his depth was fleshed out in other aspects of his portrayal of such a difficult and tragic character. <br/><br/>The combining of battles and events was needed. ATG fans will just have to suck it up like the LOTR's folks did and the Lawrence of Arabia folks did...you can only fit so much in. Besides most of the viewers have no clue what's been compressed anyway. The battle scenes were well done. I only wish that ""eagle eye"" shots of Gaugamela had shown a closer view of Alexander's tactics since the battle was brilliantly executed. Oh well. The common movie goer wouldn't know anyway. I'm not trying to say that all this attention to detail should be replaced with absolute historical fabrication but in a movie time is limited. <br/><br/>I especially liked, and feel it may be the most poignant, the ending where the generals are actually fighting over Alexander's body, actually climbing on him. It gave such a picture of the complete collapse and degeneration of all that Alexander tried to build. In death he is being raped of his accomplishments by his own men. From ""goat herders"" as he referred to them, to rulers of Persia and beyond and back again to a group of ""barbarians"" fighting over the still warm corpse of their king. <br/><br/>No it is not ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but it is the tragic tale of brilliance run horrible amuck. Of genius burning so brightly that it can only in the end extinguish itself just as one would use dynamite to blow out a raging forest fire. Alexander didn't really make it home, Lawrence did but fled into virtual obscurity. Alexander's dream began to die with Hephaestion in the movie and possible in reality. Lawrence's may have died with the death of Dahoum and his refusal to play along with the politics of ruling.<br/><br/>There will of course be detractors both on the scholarly side and the average wanna see some nice battle scenes side but I enjoyed the movie for what it was and feel that with such a huge topic to cover it was overall pretty well done."

"octagonproplex","9","2","2","23 December 2019"," Give THE FINAL CUT a try!
","Oliver Stone's ""Final Cut"" version of his much maligned Alexander the Great biographical motion picture is simply the most monumentally redeeming subsequent edit from a theatrical debacle ever.<br/><br/>There's actually four different versions available (theatrical, director's cut, final cut, ultimate cut). The rejiggering I'm most staunchly voutching for is the third version, officially titled in full as ""ALEXANDER REVISITED: THE FINAL CUT"". All the versions are significantly different in narrative context and structural articulation (well the ""Ultimate"" is just a shorter refinement of the ""Final"" I guess). However, at an unabashed 3 hours and 34 minutes, The Final Cut is the most poignantly pregnant - some 40 minutes heavier than the theatrical, even while trimming out some content from that initial release. Ironically, whereas the theatrical felt like a hard long bloated slog, this substantially more voluminous revisitation carries itself with so much more deftly assured confidence of momentive purpose that its approprately earned heartiness gives the sense of no time wasted at all. Actually, dissecting all of the various incarnations of the seemingly same production is a truly fascinating excercise if you're really curious to. Especially because of how flat-out awful the theatrical version was. While the Final Cut version does retain some flaws, it approaches something approximating masterpiece level status in its epic resonance.<br/><br/>The things you may have initially hated will all still be present - but this time they're also accounted for!<br/><br/>The Final Cut version adds back much essential scenes and nuances, as well as more brutal edits of battle that actually inform the circumstaces and stakes far more effectively. The situational geography and ingenious war tactics are readdressed with much more clarity. And it returns to the original scripted and shot intention for a non linear narrative with scenes jumping from various time periods to contextually strengthen and impact character dynamics and motivations by contrasting juxtaposition. Plus, it may have legendary greek composer Vangelis' most robustly stirring music score!<br/><br/>It's a complicated subject, from a sprawling script, and an audaciously daring director - but the 3rd time's the charm. Oliver Stone's true vision of Alexander is well worth reassessment. Trust me."

"Unknownian","1","2","2","7 September 2017"," Great Alexander...Horrible Movie
","Alexander truly was great, and this movie truly was horrible. It had a few moments that were bearable. When Alexander was preparing for the great battle with Darius, and his eagle was flying above, and he addressed his troops similar to how Mel Gibson did, as in Braveheart, it was hard not to be interested in the outcome, and the size of the spectacle to come.<br/><br/>If the rest of the movie had 1/10th as much going on for it, it may have been a success. But it wasn't to be. Instead Mr. Stone opted to go the route of vices, and emotion. He just couldn't 'imply' that the great Alexander was a homosexual, he had to explicitly 'show him' making out with his extremely gay boy lover that he plucked from his Harem in Babylon on more than one occasion. <br/><br/>Of course, if you were to believe all what you see, the entire Macedonian empire were bisexual rapists. Even if that were partially true, I think Alexander and his crew deserved the focus of his conquests be remembered and observed on what really mattered, and not to smother it with Stone reality. <br/><br/>As brilliant as Oliver Stone can be, and has been in the past, in this effort he couldn't see past his nose, and he made this potential history lesson overdoing everything, and focusing on twisted and miserable obsessions of humanity. His Alexander was a mama's boy, a cry baby, and had a 'serious daddy issue' as well. Perhaps Stone was writing about himself, because it's certainly not the Alexander the Great I read about in school.<br/><br/>The story of Alexander...the true story...we will never know, because the facts written by those closest to him were destroyed in the great fire of Alexandra. So, we are left with today's historian's best guesses, and Oliver Stones worst movie ever.<br/><br/>If you must watch it, I'm betting you turn it off before it's over. I tried to watch the Blu-ray on my giant HD screen, 4 times, before I actually got through it. Some of the worst directing in cinema history, and some great performances ruined because of it. If I could have rated it here below a 1, I would have."

","I was quite disappointed when I saw this movie, and wouldn't bother recommending it to anyone else. What was most unfortunate was that there were some really great ideas, and obviously whoever wrote it had a great knowledge of Ancient Greek history and myth.<br/><br/>For instance; Alexander's seemingly out of place blond curly hair is meant to imply divinity, and the bulls outside Darius' palace are actually replicas. Alexander, who was a lover of mythology and literature, was cleverly compared to Achilles (the way he mourns for his friend is much like the way Achilles mourned Patroclus), Heracles (Alexander wears a lions skin), Oedipus (his relationship with his mother), and Prometheus (the eagle he sees descending on him). This movie is also almost entirely historically accurate, and there is very little placing of modern values onto ancient characters, which is nice to see. To see Alexander the great compared to the heroes of his legends was incredible, as he has now become legend to us. Obviously someone involved in the process of making the movie had a payed attention to detail, though unfortunately this was almost overshadowed by some major mistakes.<br/><br/>The characters in the film were not only miscast, but basically none of them were Greek, and there was barely an attempt to pick actors who looked vaguely Greek. The use of Irish accents was also confusing, at least the director could have picked a more neutral southern English accent so that we could at least pretend they were Greek; it was definitely difficult to get over their ""Irishness."" The music was also just awful. Entire scenes were ruined by the fact that overly romantic, cheesy music was played, even complete silence would have been better. If a composer was hired to write music, and it turned out to be that terrible and not fitted to anything that was going on in the movie, then it should just be scrapped.<br/><br/>This movie was not filmed well, often camera angles and changes were not well chosen and scenes were pieced together in such a way that the movie seemed sloppy and not polished. The story of the madness and near impossibility of what he did was not truly shown, so when he is called ""Alexander the great"" people who do not already know the story would wonder why.<br/><br/>This movie took a legendary character and story, presented some great ideas which were true to Ancient Greek ideals, and somewhere in the process managed to turn it into something as mediocre as this film. Disappointing."

You don't need to fictionalise JFK or Alexander the Great: if you can't make their lives interesting give up! Oh, and for the record, none of the five basic historians of Alexander's life and conquests even address the issue of Aleander's sexuality.

"charles_leopardo","1","2","2","21 May 2009"," Why this is one of the worst films ever made
","First- Oliver Stone is neither a dramatist nor an artist; he's a ""commentator"" who uses the film medium to voice his opinions. In that regard, if Stone's in-your-face presentation of Alexander's homosexual inclinations had not raised controversy I'm sure the director would have been extremely disappointed. When Stone makes a movie about recent historical events we can at least accept the convention. When he attempts a subject from ancient history the results are as ridiculously anachronistic as Colin Farrell's Irish accent. Second- The life of Alexander the Great is a good subject for a documentary but a poor subject for a movie. The ancient Greeks invented drama, along with many other great things, and our civilization owes them an incalculable debt. Their legendary heroes (like Odysseus and Hercules) still have the power to inspire an artist, but the people themselves were just too ""different"" from us. As important as Plato is, who wants to see a bio-pic about him? Or Pericles? They are culturally far more distant from us than the ancient Romans. Despite the passage of centuries, we can still understand Julius Caesar, but Alexander seems more like a force of nature than a man, and his character is unknowable to us."

It was a scene where Alexander's love overcomes his new wife's hate. But more people were paying attention to the nudity both were showing. And since Dawson is the lesser known, people surely got to know her great looks.<br/><br/>I thought the story was OK. But for a historical epic, that is a problem.

","The movie had the potential to be one of the best movies recounting the adventures/battles of Alexander the Great. Instead, Oliver Stone decided to emphasize the homosexual tendencies of Alexander and men of that time. There was nothing important about Homosexuality back in that time and the emphasis that Oliver Stone put in the movie is anachronistically incorrect. The movie should have emphasized the battles and strategic strategies employed by Alexander the Great. Instead, the movie was mostly about his sex exploits (which have had no impact on history as opposed to his almost global domination) and relationship with his mother. The simple fact that the movie was barely entertaining and dragged on for two hours makes this the biggest waste of a movie I have ever seen. I saw the movie with two of my brothers and the one thing that we all agreed upon was the fact that this was the worst ""potential"" movie (A movie that had great potential) we have ever seen. It was so bad that with about 15 minutes left in the movie, some old man in the front row realized he just wasted $10 and started yelling at the screen, which was OK because the dialogue was useless anyways. Bad dialogue, two and a half battles from a man whose entire adult life consisted of battles, and war strategy, and a horrible feeling of two plus hours wasted makes this the worst movie I have ever voluntarily watched."

There were some nice sets and the wardrobe wasn't that bad, but I can't find much else that I can compliment. This movie just never got interesting. The story jumped back and forth in time, never flowing or making any sense. The 'pulse' or 'tempo' seemed to rise and fall randomly, with useless screaming and spitting. I couldn't follow it. I even tried to watch it again, thinking that maybe I missed something the first time that would have made it more enjoyable. No-such-luck. I can't imagine how much money was wasted making this movie. Some people surely had to loose their jobs, or at least their credibility. What was Oliver Stone trying to do here? It would seem that he did a few bong hits, watched Gladiator, then decided to make a movie that would attract a similar audience. Im my opinion, the two movies don't even compare. Regardless of the cast, budget, or storyline, I can usually find a few good qualities in any movie. With Alexander I feel like I just wasted three hours of my life and I want to warn anyone who is thinking about watching this to not set your hopes too high."

Which isn't much since all other were blatant falsifications. At least they are not making stuff up (a lot). But they're omitting or casting aside crucial parts of the story. That's certainly no way to accomplish an ambitious task of bringing Alexander closer to a modern movie-goer. <br/><br/>The movie falls flat at its basics - the approach to the person of Alexander. Instead of presenting us qualities that made Alexander great, Stone opted for ""debunking"" the legend (like he tried to debunk lone-gunman theory). He went for an unoriginal, generic view on him as a frustrated, troubled tyrant. That translates to a formulaic ""common man overwhelmed by events"". Stone believes that Alexander's greatness is some sort of an ancient PR, or even conspiracy. He narrowmindedly misses the big picture, because despite his flaws, Alexander had to have certain ""something"" that made him the greatest conquerer in history. Ordinary tyrants weren't loved by the army, didn't conquer so much space in ten years and weren't welcomed and remembered as liberators in the cities they occupied as Alexander was. Almost everything he did was presented in the movie either as something he was forced into or something that just happened to him. Wrong!<br/><br/>Stone didn't get it, he couldn't present it and Colin Farrell certainly didn't help. But they surely trumpeted homoerotic relationships like they were such a big deal at the time. Wrong again! Good movie on Alexander is yet to be made. Maybe by that time they'll even have the guts to make actors speak in Greek."

","When a film is directed by Oliver Stone and has in its cast such luminaries as Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Colin Farrell and Val Kilmer, a prospective viewer would feel entitled to expect something special. Unfortunately, in watching this film, most viewers will find only something ordinary. Very ordinary. <br/><br/>Like the Torture of a Thousand Cuts, there are a thousand annoying ways in which this film fails to satisfy. For a start, there are the accents. Colin Farrell and Val Kilmer appear to have affected some form of Irish accent while Angelina Jolie sounds as though she is doing a poor impression of Count Dracula. Among the support cast there is such a myriad of various accents that one could feel like a visitor to the United Nations on open day. <br/><br/>Then there is the acting. With the sole exception of Anthony Hopkins, who delivers a measured and convincing performance as the narrator of the story, Old Ptolemy, all the other players seem to be reaching for something and coming up short. <br/><br/>Rosario Dawson looks divine, but fails to even reach mediocrity as Alexander's wife Roxane. The scenes between Farrell and Dawson had me squirming in my seat, as if I were listening to a poorly-tuned piano. <br/><br/>The battle scenes (as you might expect, there are more than a few) are, on the whole, better than average, although I do have to be a bit critical of Stone's reaching for the clichÃ©d slow-motion effect rather too frequently. At least the viewer has some chance of determining who is who in the fighting - some recent action films (think Troy, King Arthur) presented blurred kaleidoscopes where the viewer was left with no understanding of what transpired.<br/><br/>Of course, the plot has Alexander marching ever onwards in an attempt to conquer the world from end to end (it was flat in those days!). There is a degree of behind the scenes skulduggery involving his mother, Olympias (played by Jolie), who has convinced Alexander that his father is the god Zeus. A further sub-plot surrounds Alexander's love life, principally his relationship with his boyhood friend Hephaistion.<br/><br/>In the end, this film is largely unsatisfying. There are no stand-out performers amongst this A-list of actors, and the plot is not well enough constructed to hold the viewer's attention throughout."
"toastboy54","5","2","2","28 July 2006"," Alexander...Not so great
","Alexander had the budget and all the players for the making of a great movie. But almost anyone will agree that it just doesn't work. Why? I've watched both versions of the film and I've tried to narrow it down to just a few main reasons the film doesn't really come together in the end:<br/><br/>1. Alexander Himself - Though I can't say Colin Farrell would be my ideal choice to play the part, I don't blame this on the actor. I have serious trouble with the way Alexander is portrayed in the script as a generally weak, whiny, indecisive drunkard who asks his friends' council then ignores it completely, and then seems to go totally bat-sh@# insane every time he hits the battlefield. When we watch this portrayal, we can't help but ask the obvious question: Why the hell would ANYONE follow this guy anywhere, let alone beyond the reaches of the known world? <br/><br/>2. The Romance (both hetero- and homosexual) - There's no point in questioning Alexander's affection for his wife or his male lovers, because he tells us, and the movie tells us, repeatedly how much he loves and cares for them. But that's just the problem. For all the misty eyed looks he gives Hephaistion (Jared Leto), Bagoas, and Roxane, we never really have a reason to care. Despite the presence of three major relationships in the film, none of them seem to directly affect Al's decisions, nor do they satisfy the audience's inherent liking for a love interest. I mean, if Oliver Stone's not interested in convincing the audience of the passion that Alexander feels for these people, then stop rubbing it in our faces, as if we can't just accept it for what it is. Despite Stone's vehement reaction toward the public's dismissal of the film, supposedly for its homosexual content, he's certainly careful not to show too much. Honestly, how many aimless, weepy Alexander/Hephaistion scenes do I have to sit through before the director feels like he's convinced me?<br/><br/>3. The Director - I respect Oliver Stone and I appreciate that he likes to take risks. But the simple fact is that this movie is what I call ""all questions and no answers."" On the film commentary, Stone asks ""why did these men follow Alexander?"" ""Why did Alexander take Roxane as his wife?"" ""Was Alexander's mother really behind this or that?"" And yet Stone offers no answers to these questions. It's an interesting approach that probably looked good on paper, but when the audience must question the motives of even the main character, this simply becomes frustrating.<br/><br/>4. Style - While something can be said for Stone's unique take on the material in an overly-theatrical manner, using all kinds of accents to portray ethnic differences between characters, this approach does more to distract the audience than to intrigue them. Indeed, much of the constant, over-dramatic yelling comes off as unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>All in all, I didn't hate Alexander. Indeed, I thought it at least tried harder than Troy to convey an artistic portrait of an epic era long past. Even so, it's ultimately a thumbs down for me. 5 out of 10."
"slcchina","6","2","2","21 July 2006"," Coulda Shoulda Wasn't
","There is so much cinematic potential in the story of Alexander the Great - and almost none of it made it to the screen. Mythic/historical gems like the Gordian Knot, the siege of Tyre, and it's all left by the wayside in favor of over-emphasizing Alexander's bisexual nature. After about the fourth or fifth reference to this, I felt like saying ""enough, we get it already."" Despite how much was made of the cavalry charge, that scene, along with many others, really felt as if Oliver Stone wasn't so much directing a new movie but borrowing heavily from others (Braveheart comes to mind rather readily, but there are similarities to many other films), and there were many other battles to choose from, much more pivotal and important, that would have also greatly added the character depth that was ultimately missing from this film. (I can't fault the actors for that, either, as blame rests solely on the people who made the decisions about what scenes went into the finished film.) For as ambitious as this film was supposed to be, it was quite a let down and again, that's as much from what was left out of the film as what was in it. As a gay/alternative lifestyle pride film, it works, and Colin Farrel's acting is grounded enough, but anyone looking for a solid historical epic should rent something else."
"madisonwisconsinite","4","2","2","22 November 2005"," This could have been much better
","Frequent segues badly interrupt the chronology of an already complicated story. The military action is confusing, cloudy, not explained, and with poor sound which prevents the viewer from hearing what is yelled above the excessive din of battle. The story leaves out a number of events in Alexander's life which I'm surprised to see left out. Typical of modern films, the sex is exclusively heterosexual in spite of Alexander's well-known appetite for men, two of whom featured in the film: Hephaestion and Bagoas. In fairness, we do see Colin (or a double) naked, showing a bare butt and balls while getting into bed, with an implication that someone male is going to accompany him, but this is vaguely implied, and only an informed viewer would be aware that the male companion is Bagoas. It isn't necessary to excessively glorify the beauty of gay relationships, but why so significantly avoid them in one of history's greatest personages who was undeniably gay? I further have to wonder why key characters were played by actors who had to dye their hair to play the roles - are there no blonds who could have played Alexander if it was essential that he be blond? Farrell certainly looked hot, but blond hair with black eyebrows has always looked a little bit weird to me. Even the boy who plays the young Alexander has the wrong color hair, and must have worn a wig and had his hair dyed. And why have Jonathan Rhys Meyers just standing in the background all the time? He hardly had any dialog in the film - what a waste of talent. The final analysis for me comes out of the fact that I collect films with several actors who I have a strong interest in. These include Rhys Meyers, Farrell, and Leto, but even with all three in this film, I have no plan to buy it or even make a copy of it. ALEXANDROS (imdb don't support his name in Greek) deserved something much better than this, and I found the film quite disappointing. What a waste of talent."
"filmbuff-36","6","2","2","8 September 2005"," Stone can't control his story or characters, and lets technical effects take over
","What profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul? Such is the conundrum of Alexander the Great, one of the world's great conquerors and subject of Oliver Stone's film ""Alexander."" Alexander (Colin Farrell) is the son of Macedonian king Philip (Val Kilmer), a hedonistic ruler obsessed with his own legacy. His mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) is a shadowy Lady Macbeth, filling the boy with delusions of grandeur and plotting behind Philip's back. Alexander is torn between loyalties to his father, a strict pragmatist who sees suffering as the reward for greatness, and his mother, who sees him destined to rule the world.<br/><br/>With war looming against the Persian Empire, Philip is assassinated and Alexander assumes control of the kingdom. He goes to war with Persia, conquering a superior force on the fields of Gaugamela and taking the city of Babylon as his prize. Not content with the spoils of war, he pursues the Persian king Darius into the wilderness with his army, including childhood friend turned sexual interest Hephaestion (Jared Leto).<br/><br/>As Alexander conquers more lands to the east, his power and legend grows. However, turmoil among the ranks of his soldiers who fear they will never return home along with foolish political movies such as marrying Roxane (Rosario Dawson), the daughter of a ""savage"" chieftain, strain his power to the breaking point. As Alexander becomes obsessed with bringing order to the known world, that same world seems ready to consume him at every turn.<br/><br/>""Alexander"" has all the trappings of a great historical epic, but somehow it never comes together. The editing is disjointed, the narrative clumsily jumps back and forth between different eras, and the narration by Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) seems in place to explain the shoddy scene transitions to the audience rather than give insight into the characters. The gay aspects of Alexander's life are sensationalized and not treated with much realism. This isn't an epic; it's a monstrosity whose parts are greater than the whole.<br/><br/>To be fair, director Stone gives it his best shot. The movie certainly looks great, and the two battle scenes are handled with expert precision. But Stone can't keep his art house flourishes out of the movie. He insists on having close-ups of the eyes of wild animals, screws around with the film exposure and color tint and loads the film with enough of his trademark conspiracy theories to make five films.<br/><br/>Farrell gives a good performance, but he's still not right for the part here. The role of Alexander demands someone with more power, and Farrell plays the character with too many flaws to be believable as one of history's greatest leaders. That may be more the fault of Stone however, who co-wrote the screenplay.<br/><br/>Jolie and Kilmer are more interesting as Alexander's parents, but their presence amounts to little more than extended cameos. Leto has nothing to do except provide emotion support and fawn over Alexander. Dawson comes the closest to making an impact, but her character is sadly designated to the sidelines in favor of sequences of women dancing suggestively and gradual breakdown of morale among the men.<br/><br/>If even a quarter of this film is true, then Alexander the Great was truly a progressive idealist for his time, envisioning a kingdom of equal citizens of all races. However, the message in Stone's film ""Alexander"" comes off as too anachronistic and politically correct for the era in which it takes place. Like 2004's other ancient Greek epic ""Troy,"" the movie is an all-star special effects laden event on a quest for a better plot.<br/><br/>Six out of 10 stars. Stone's film is certainly lively, but the editing is off, Farrell is too petulant to be believable as one of history's great leaders, and it all collapses under it's own weight."
"devagori","2","2","2","24 August 2005"," Vox populi=scaltera
","I guess one can be proud being a Greek, or proud being bi-sexual or gay, or whatever, to have Alexander epically treated on the screen. The question still remains: how is the subject treated? When errors are made in the script that any European 10-year old could have avoided is this not insulting rather flattering?<br/><br/>No, Achilles did not withdraw from battle because his (gay) lover had been killed. Rather he withdrew from battle because he had been deprived of a female sex toy originally given to him as a spoil of war (sorry, gay guys). Then he withdrew from battle, and Patrochlus donned his armor to impersonate him and got killed. Achilles went back into battle to avenge him. If the king of Macedonia (his father, Philip) can't get that straight I would be insulted as a Greek.<br/><br/>This is the major flaw in the movie. It appears to be mired in male same-sex orientation while paying little attention to why Alexander may have been ""Great."" The founding of Alexandria (actually the entire conquest of Egypt) is completely omitted and there is not even a mention of Persepolis which replaced Babylon as the main city of what had been the Persian Empire. The battles are covered through a cloud of dust often with mere indications that this is the ""left,"" or this is the ""right"" as if that really gives us any idea as to what is going on. Often the action seems to indicate a completely different winner from the actual who is inevitably Alexander. Alexander may be a Macedonian but he is still the leader of a united Greek force. The fact that he addresses, and the movie refers to this great army, alternately as ""Macedonian"" or ""Greek"" apparently at random is quite sloppy.<br/><br/>Time lines are continuously being jumbled in order to accommodate Jolie's appearance throughout the movie. After all, historically Alexander never sees his mother again once he leaves on his campaign. The role properly belonged to an adequate supporting actress who disappears from the scene after twenty minutes or so. Instead, we go 3 years before, nine years later, etc. until we literally can't tell whether Alexander is coming or going.<br/><br/>Alexander's inner demons, or whatever his problems were, are often mumbled throughout, though usually unintelligibly, both because of his accent and the loud background noise. All we know is that Alexander just isn't happy and about this time neither are we.<br/><br/>By the time he gets to India and he encounters, of all things, Neanderthals (slow down the action , even freeze frame if you don't believe me)-it becomes apparent this is truly one of the worst done Epic movies of all time. Recognizing either the Greeks or the gaily oriented through such a vehicle is merely insulting. And the average movie-goer who is neither Greek nor gay cannot help but see this movie for what it is. A terrible mistake even as a High School production."
"the_Poppuns","5","2","2","11 August 2005"," Alexander, the so-so
","I was surprised that this movie actually wasn't good. I usually don't agree with the critics, and I'm not sure if I do here either. I may dislike it for entirely different reasons. My problems are basically that there was too much narration, too many close-ups, and just too many people.<br/><br/>The narration. For the record I should say that one of my major complaints about The Grinch (2001), was Anthony Hopkins' narration. I'm not a fan of his voice and don't get why everyone else is. So if it was just your normal average amount of voice-over work it would have been bad enough for me. But here it seems as though they took away the story from most of the other actors and gave it to him. I dunno. When I watch a movie, it's to ""watch"" a movie. I don't put on movies to have the story told to me. So my thinking is that the decision to give Hopkins the major storytelling duties was the main reason why this film went wrong.<br/><br/>The close-ups. This surprised me. As I watched this I felt like at every moment I was only looking at a face, or an arm, or a mane. I couldn't tell what was going on in the battle scenes because they were too close. You see an arm and some dust and hear a clank, and what does that tell you? I have no idea. Usually when someone gets close-up happy it's because there is some huge star in it and they want to sell the movie based on how good-looking they are. But in this case there were scenes where I was looking at extra, after extra, after extra, who had no lines. And I'm thinking, gee, all the time that I'm wasting looking at these random people could have been spent advancing the story. But god knows if I wasn't staring at these people I'd be listening to more Ptolemy yikkity-yak.<br/><br/>Too many people. I already brought up the extras. And I think it's great to actually hire people instead of CGI but, geez, not if that's going to happen. And beyond that mob scene, there is the problem of Alexander's posse. I'm no history buff, but I can't believe that Alexander constantly had a group with him every second. That's at least what it seemed like in this movie. I wondered if he even went to the toilet by himself. You didn't get any sense of who the characters around him were because it was like every actor in the scene got one line and they were always together, like they were a chorus or something. Did no one ever pull him aside for a private moment? Just his mom and his boyfriend? And speaking of his boyfriend, he hardly had anything to do with him. And I'm sitting there trying to figure out why. Gay or not, he was supposed to be his best bud and yet for the most part he was lumped in there with the rest of the posse. That didn't make any sense. I think Harry Potter and Ron Weasley have had more tender moments alone, not to even mention Frodo and Sam. So the idea that the audience can't handle a close male relationship on film without thinking it's sexual is really ridiculous at this point in time. So if it's an projected homophobia onto the audience that caused that relationship to suffer, that's silly. My other thought was that maybe they had so little faith in Colin that they dulled every other character down to avoid anyone outshining him.<br/><br/>Too many people, part deux. I watched the behind the scenes stuff on the DVD and there seemed to be way too many people on the set looking like they were on a coffee break. I like huge productions, I like watching 'making of's. I've never seen anything that had a movie set resembling a mosh pit before. So I actually think this movie was doomed early on.<br/><br/>I liked the cast, which makes the whole thing even more tragic. Maybe they could have picked a more obvious person for Alexander but Colin Farrell wasn't bad at all. (I disagree with Stone on who he resembles. Peter O'Toole, my foot. I personally kept being reminded of a late 80's Agassi). Jared Leto was underused. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, was horrifyingly underused. Rosario Dawson was basically naked. (I personally think her nakedness bordered on exploitation, and I'm not one to normally think things like that). Angelina Jolie's role was great somehow. And Val Kilmer was wonderful as usual, even if he looked exactly like the Ghost of Christmas Present in one scene. And I'm giving 4 of my 5 points to those actors who I feel got gypped. And everyone else on the production can split the other point. Was there set direction or costume design? I couldn't see any behind all the giant heads. And since everyone seems to want to compare this to Troy, I definitely am in the Troy camp."

","The critics really tore this movie apart, and I have yet to understand just why. They said it was long and boring, homoerotic, and that all characters were vastly miscast. <br/><br/>The long part, I can't argue with, but when was the last time anyone has seen an epic drama under two hours? It's simply not possible. As far as boredom goes, I disagree entirely. There have been several comparisons to ""Troy"", and that movie, I found an absolute bore-fest. Now, structurally, the two films were very similar, and there were few reasons to make me enjoy ""Alexander"" so much more. <br/><br/>That brings me to my next point: Above and beyond all else, however, I felt everyone was perfectly casted, Colin Farrell in particular. I did not see him as a ""pretty boy"" nor did his blonde hair (with the roots everyone complained about that actually only appeared for a mere five minutes of the film) phase me. His performance as Alexander was stellar, at worst.<br/><br/>The so-called ""homoeroticism"" was scant. There was far more verbal evidence than there was physical and the heterosexual scenes were far more explicit. (I don't know if this could be considered a spoiler, but I am going to cite an actual scene in the film). It was funny to me, the ignorance of American audiences today. In the beginning of the film, the boys are being lectured in class and the teacher explains to them that if man lays with man in passion, he will reap bad results, but if man lays with man in love and in virtue, he will be rewarded. Audience reaction? Nothing. Later, Alexander professes his love and undying devotion to his dearest friend Hephaistion. Audience reaction? Groans. Alright, I've got it. A man can have sex with a man, as long as he doesn't have any feelings toward him. Makes tons of sense, huh? What a sad little narrow-minded world it is in which we live.<br/><br/>It is my firm believing that the critics were simply too caught up in their dislike of Oliver Stone, a director, mind you, that is entitled to far more respect than he is getting, for, in an industry that is all to consumed with the idea of a commercial success, he is one of the few directors more concerned with making his statement and I, personally, applaud him for it.<br/><br/>While I do believe that frequent moviegoers ought to read the reviews to see what kind of reaction a film received, I also believe that one ought to formulate one's own opinion after viewing. In this particular case, I find myself highly juxtaposed to the critical reaction, with, I feel, good reason.

Besides all the homosexual behavior, the movie itself wasn't that great to begin with.<br/><br/>I've never really been a fan of Oliver Stone anyway, in case the summary doesn't clue you in.<br/><br/>Overall you can't really take my opinion to heart since I really really don't like Oliver Stone."

","This movie was panned by critics and movie-goers alike, and though many people put a lot of time and effort into explaining why, the truth is that 90% of the blame can be attributed to one simple thing: The unbelievably bad 'accents' of most - if not all - of the main characters. Just as the audience is having some success in suspending their disbelief, trying not to notice that the settings look like bad CGI even when they aren't, getting over the fact that Alexander's mother (Angelina Jolie) doesn't appear to age over the course of 25 or 30 years, and accepting that the story is totally historically inaccurate, one of the main characters opens their mouth and speaks in some totally bizarre accent that reminds them that this is a movie, and a badly-done one at that.<br/><br/>Oh sure, at first it's okay - Anthony Hopkins' accent is a standard 'British theatre' kind of accent, and Christopher Plummer's Aristotle is in the same vein. But then the young Alexander starts migrating to some kind of inconsistent Scottish accent. At first you wonder why, but the answer soon becomes clear: Colin Farrell, who plays the grown-up Alexander - apparently can't manage a British theatre-type accent, and so delivers his lines in a slightly toned-down version of his normal Scottish-accented voice. Because Farrell can't get rid of his Scottish accent, the kid playing young Alexander has to use a Scottish accent for consistency's sake. On top of which, Alexander's father (Val Kilmer) then has to speak in some kind of bizarre hybrid of 'British theatre' and 'Scottish' accents in order to demonstrate how Alexander ended up with a Scottish accent! Angelina Jolie's accent is similarly atrocious: She seems to be using some kind of vaguely Eastern European or Russian-type accent, for reasons known only to herself. I think it's supposed to reinforce the fact that she comes from a different background than Alexander's father, but it's not only a bizarre choice (Russia and 'eastern Europe' didn't even exist at the time) but Jolie's delivery is so bad it's like watching a teenager in their first high school play. I thought her British accent in Tomb Raider was reasonably well done - why didn't they just let her use that, instead of these amateur-hour rolled-Rs? As we've seen with other Oliver Stone films, even the most far-fetched, historically-inaccurate plot and the most schlocky dialogue can be redeemed by decent 'delivery' by first-rate actors (and, whatever else you might say, Hopkins, Jolie, Farrell and Kilmer are all recognized as 'serious' actors). Hopkins, Jolie et all have been in the business for a long time - so why didn't one of them speak up and say, ""Hey Oliver, you need to get us a vocal coach, dude. We are totally sucking here."" More importantly, why didn't Oliver Stone recognize that their accents were ruining any chance he had at making Alexander successful at the box office and with critics?"

","Never before would I have dreamed of submitting a critique of anyone's work, especially here. But after my experience last night I couldn't rest until I got it off my chest! I had to turn this bactrian banality off once Farrel/Alexander got to India and before I dropped off in a catatonic stupor from watching the title actor sleep walk through his lines or stare past the camera like an imbecile. When the script did give him something to bite into he simply raised his voice and made spittle fly off his lips: this is acting?? How did such a great adventure turn into such melodramatic mush? The photography and sets had great potential but ended up looking like snapshots from my Uncle's last Wyoming trip. The flahsbacks and story structure must have had the Titans spinning in their graves under Mt Olympus for the complete lack of story telling ability.<br/><br/>Its obvious that either Stone lost complete control of this picture early on or he simply is an overindulgent hack who lucked out with a couple of good production teams early in his career. I could see Gilliam turning out this kind of crap if he was over medicated with anti-depressants. Consider this: if Peter Jackson (and I think he's just a lucky, big budget craftsman rather than a creative filmmaker) had made Alexander, wouldn't it have been a hell of a lot richer, more textured, much more well made and plain old more watchable?? And believe me, that's not really a homage to Jackson! Oliver Stone blew it on Alexander, big time!"
"artibeus-jamaicensis","2","7","12","14 August 2005"," pretty fantasy, but excruciatingly boring
","Bad, but not bad enough to be funny (unlike Troy, which was so bad one had to laugh). Bad mediocre. As a movie, it flops from lack of an overarching story, sluggish pace, and plain lethargy. Maybe broken into 28-min bits it might work, a sort of ""Look what happens to Alexander"" weekly series. Alexander is a legendary man of mythical stature, yes human, but also a hero remembered to this day throughout the lands he razed and conquered. What, then, to make of this man that can barely carry his armor? And what of the awkward flashback device, generating flashback-within-a-flashback moments? <br/><br/>And then there is the homophobia. Why is it okay to show 5 minutes of sex with Rosario Dawson, but not okay to show one kiss between Alexander and Hephaistion? This says more about the calculations from the director and producers than about the motives and emotions of Alexander. As with other recent movies (Batman Begins comes to mind), the fight scenes are too confusing to deliver a punch. Yes, maybe that's what soldiers actually feel like. But this is a movie, not boot camp, we're supposed to feel moved (or claustrophobic, or frightened) by the battle, not frustrated to the brink of walking out. The accents are grating and, depending on one's point of view, Angelina Jolie is either an embarrassment or the comic relief that makes the movie watchable. <br/><br/>And for all the historians out there, the library of Alexandria was not founded until Ptolemy II. Cleopatra did a better job at re-creating the site. Kudos for the Macedonian lancers, and for the gates of Babylon, though.<br/><br/>In sum, not worth the time/money of this viewer."

","I have been looking forward to this film for a while now, even though I am not an Oliver Stone fan, I have always loved the story of Alexander the Great.<br/><br/>The movie was not what I expected because I didn't find it to be a very ""Hollywood"" type film or an epic film. I found it to really just tell the story of Alexander and I respect Oliver Stone for that. Oliver Stone presents Alexander the Greats life as he found it to be through his research, and while it is laced with Oliver Stone's opinion, it is not forced. He does give you both sides of how things may have been (referring to lovers and his death)and that's fairly rare. I truly felt like I was being told a story about a legendary man. Alexander was also humanized instead of glorified in the film, which I also respect. We see his flaws, his trials, we understand why the people loved him, we see what made him a great leader, and we realize what made him fall.<br/><br/>Now, with all that said, I found the performance to be inconsistent. At times I felt the actors weren't sure why they were committing to a line. But at times they were quite powerful. The one sensation that I took away from the film is what a passionate man Alexander was, about all aspects of his life. As for the accents, well they were all over the place and as off putting as that may be, it does not break a film, it hurts it.<br/><br/>The camera work on Anthony Hopkins performances was distracting and awkward, but the coverage, angles and cinematography in general in the battle scenes I found to be very effective. The production design was stellar, but the score left me wanting more, a man like that should have had a theme as dynamic as him. All in all, I'm glad I saw it; I wish it was stronger all around, but compared to a lot of the junk that is in theaters these days, it's a fairly respectable film. I give it a c+.<br/><br/>On a quick personal note, may I just say that to all the people who feel there should have been homosexual action I just have to say that you don't need sex to portray love. Love is portrayed in this film without a kiss, unless you're deaf and blind. For those who feel Alexander was not bisexual and are offended by the suggestion can just refuse to believe it and write their own film. This is Oliver Stone's interpretation, not yours and he was rather tactful with his suggestion. It's unfortunate that some rate the entire film by that notion."

","Look, Oliver Stone is one of the finest directors in the history of cinema. Platoon, JFK, Natural Born Killers amongst his rest are some of the best movies ever made. The fact that some people who just plain don't understand him continue to post outrageous claims about how he's terrible for movies need to grow up and realize that the reason hes so different is why he's so good in the first place. Alexander, while not being his best work, is still a triumph. You're all so quick to blow it off while not even understanding the passion and comittment Stone put into making the film in the first place. Stone doesn't give two shits what is publicly sound or morally right. He presents his movies in the way he understands them and if you don't like it, the Don't watch it and certainly don't start expressing your distaste for something that you cant appreciate. If your the type of person who thought the Lord of the Rings movies were the best ever made......I'm talking to you. The cinematography, direction, and visuals were all top notch and the acting did exactly what it was supposed to do. Represent a clear portrayal for the time period and that it does. If the homosexual scenes bother you. Don't watch it. But you can bet thats exactly how it was back then. This is Oliver Stones vision and by far his most ambitious project to date. Too many film makers form into the standard that Hollywood creates for them and they just churn out dog poo. The truth is that everybody needs a little Oliver Stone in them and cinema would be a much better experience."

","After being bombarded with terrible reviews, I decided to see this movie for myself. I enjoyed it, and thought it was well-done, if the storytelling felt funny in some parts.<br/><br/>I did not think this movie was worthy of the horrible grades given to it by 'professional' movie critics or IMDb users. I believe that these criticisms are entirely caused by the portrayal of Alexander as bisexual or homosexual in the film.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie he is most assuredly portrayed in this manner, and you shouldn't see it if this is going to irritate you. If you get tired of shady beckonings by Colin Farrell to attractive young men, don't see the movie. If you don't like the idea of the conquerer idolizing Achilles and the hero's love of his friend Patroclus, just don't see the movie. But what you should definitely not do is go onto internet forums and say the entire movie is terrible.<br/><br/>I feel most of the criticism to this movie comes solely from a section of society that fears homosexuals, and is afraid this movie will somehow promote homosexuality. It doesn't. It's just the same as any movie that portrays a hero in love with a woman. But some people seem urged to write the movie off and make sure others do the same just for its hero's different tastes.<br/><br/>Bottom line: A good movie, but don't see it if you will be bothered heavily by any hint of homosexuality."

","I really wanted to like this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of everything medieval. I'm a card carrying member of the SCA (But the garb WASN'T period) and I've read many many books on this period.<br/><br/>After this movie was over (I think it lasted about 8 hours) I was so flummoxed, I could barely talk about it.<br/><br/>First the good...some of the scenes shot are among the most beautiful I've ever seen. I don't mean beautiful as in Asian movie scene that never exists in reality beautiful. I mean really beautiful. Remarkably composed, engaging, pulls you to that place kind of beautiful.<br/><br/>The acting is also pretty good. Angelina Jolie (who seemed to spend the whole movie in her bedroom playing with snakes and looking hotter than anyone human has a right to look) gives a very memorable performance. Anthony Hopkins (who in the movie looks about 200 years old) provides a voice-over that seems to last longer than Alexander's life. Farrell himself is unremarkable. He has some chops but isn't up to the action sequences. To his credit, I'm not sure anyone would be though, particularly the fight in India.<br/><br/>Thats where the good ends.<br/><br/>We can talk about the muddled plot line which was wierdly non linear. For some reason, yet to be determined Stone shows Philips assassination about an hour and a half after Anthony Hopkins tells you about it; it was to illustrate the dubious loyalty of a character that had maybe 3 more lines in the whole movie. <br/><br/>We can talk about the hard to hear dialogue. There's a lot of it, and not all of it is hard to hear. But the dialogue that is hard to hear is at least 2 movies' worth.<br/><br/>The lighting and set directions were competent but Stone seems to rely on extreme closeups (NOSTRIL HAIR!) to build character, shaky hand held stuff to relay chaotic battle scenes and annoying lighting to illuminate the story. He did this much better in Natural Born Killers (with a Woody Harrelson's face going in and out of focus while the word DEMON was lit on his chest). <br/><br/>The other thing that I found exhausting was that there was little plot development, which is endemic to biographies but there was no dramatic arc. It was like Stone spent so many years developing Alexander that he couldn't decide what to get rid of. Being the heavyweight in Hollywood that he is (rightfully so in the case of many of his movies) I guess he decided that he didn't have to get rid of anything.<br/><br/>The issue that seems to be the focus of so much media debate is that of Alexander's bisexuality. Its pretty unimportant to the movie that the love of Alexander's life seems to have been a male played by Jared Leto who is really really disturbing looking. They used an awful amount of eye liner on the man, really really badly and I cringed whenever he came on screen. That seems to be a theme for me with Jared. I haven't been able to look at him without cringing since Requiem for a Dream. <br/><br/>The gay themes aren't important. But then again, neither is the movie."

","I don't know why this movie is getting so much bad press. From complaints about the 3 hours plus running time, to assertions about wooden acting, I went expecting this movie to be a waste of time. But after watching the history channel's History or Hollywood, I decided to take a chance, since, apparently, this movie is very accurate-given the little that is known about Alexander's private life and thoughts.<br/><br/>I found that this movie is, first and foremost, for those who are into history and other cultures and especially Greek mythos and culture. The ethos and peoples of that time were, of course, different from those of our time and-specifically-our culture. In a thousand years, others will look back on our culture and time and find them very alien to theirs with few similarities.<br/><br/>Beyond that, this film shows the genius and humanity of this great man and what situations and experiences made him who he was. The bulk of the movie is couched between two great pivotol battles, the first against the Persian Empire and the second against India. Although I found these battles to be highly realistic and amazing, given the strategy that these peoples employed, the movie is less battle and more about character. If you go for blood and guts without substance, you won't like this movie; it engages the mind and emotions more than anything else. But the acting, I thought, was quite good; especially from Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer-not usually a favorite of mine, and Angelina Jolie-who has disappointed in the past. But decide for yourself, it is, after all, only my opinion. By the way, for me the 3 plus hours flew by pretty quickly. And all this from a guy who really prefers women."

The battlefield scenes are bone crunching and action packed and not to be forgotten easily.This is an understatement. Visually I think the film is a treat, great camera-work and very much eye for detail of surroundings and costumes. The overall acting is OK, but could have been a bit better. Hopkins and Farrell good as usual, Kilmer and Jolie disappointing in my eyes. Historically the film seems correct to me, although I must admit I'm not an expert on this topic. I think Stone did a great job on showing the exceptional male friendship between Alexander and his long time friend Hephaistion. At last the lenght of the movie was a bit to long, 175 minutes should have been 150 max if you ask me. To summarize: worth watching, and definitely not as bad as the critics say.

This is coming from someone who thoroughly enjoyed Wolfgang Peterson's TROY , the epic Lord of the Rings movies and most well made epics. This, sadly, doesn't come close. Colin Farell is awful. Val Kilmer & Angelina Jolie aren't bad, but there roles give them no chance and Stone directs the movie so badly and clumsily, it's almost comical. Alas, only almost...what it is, is incredibly dull.

","Alexander is a waste of money, both mine and the people who financed the film. While watchable and certainly not the work of an amateur, it lacks direction in the plot, and merely skims over the surface of the life of Alexander. It lacks the scope and vision of a great film about one of history's notable figures.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are okay, a bit messy in direction. And for one of the great conquerors of the world, there is very little time given to fighting. The problem is that it tries to walk the line between epic and character driven, and succeeds as neither. Not enough fighting, and then not enough scope in the character scenes. There's plenty of dialogue, but it doesn't enhance the plot of the film. A reasonable amount is given to Alexander's character and whatnot, but it fails to develop into an interesting story, and so is simply an expensive, indulgent and ultimately shallow look at his life. There is no real attention given to the size of the empire (although it is mentioned, it fails to appear as anything more than a throwaway comment); the dissension in the ranks is only shown in some hollow-feeling false dramatic scenes. What we are left with as the film progresses is a disconnected series of scenes that fail to drive the story or allow the audience to actually engage with the characters and environment.<br/><br/>The reason why it didn't do well at the box office and with me, is that its just not any good.

I expected the movie to be reasonably bad from the reviews, but I was still disappointed. Recently Kingdom of Heaven came out, and that is what Alexander could have been; a movie with clear historical context and narrative, a clear vision of the strategy and development of the main characters. Had Alexander been drastically cut: the battle simulations eliminated and redone with narrative and clear visuals, the relationship with his mother less about filming snakes... then maybe this film could have had a little more impact."

I cannot find another reason for the totally awful realization for the astonishing life of Alexander. If he wanted to shock his audience with his movie, well he succeeded with me, but not in the sense he wanted; this is a piece of total garbage. When I look at a movie about Alexander, I really want to see a movie about that. The costumes, the relations with his parents, the depiction of his wife, the time-line, the death, the strong accent on bisexuality, all was changed. If to be bisexual was normal in Alexander's time, why was accentuated in the movie? Just to shock the viewers, so commercial purpose.

The movie is spastic and one can never figure out what the director is trying to say. I felt nothing for any of the character since no effort was made to make the audience empathize with them. Angelina Jolie was a stand out amongst this droll film though, pretty convincingly playing Alexander's jealous and conniving mother. Anthony Hopkins as ""narrator"" was odd and felt disjointed with the rest of the movie. It would have felt more natural if they just let the movie tell its self instead of making it like a ""story book"" film, I just don't feel that it was that type of story."

This failure of epic proportions begets questioning Hollywood's vision of the sixth art.<br/><br/>When I first heard of Olivers Stone's ""Alexander"", I got very excited. The previews arose great expectations among the public. Little did we know that it was all a scam. I've been an admirer of Mr. Stone as a director. I honestly expected a film like ""Braveheart"", with ""Any given Sunday""'s style. The life of Alexander The Great is one that could have been enough material for a truly transcendent film. Why did they have to focus on the details that don't matter? Why is the movie based on his love life instead of his great accomplishments? In the previews you can see more action than in the whole movie, and not once they mention anything about homosexuality. Why? Because they knew that if they showed what the movie was truly about, no one would have gone to see it.<br/><br/>The acting is laughable, (a lot of people laughed a lot during very serious moments, mocking the stupidity of the situations, and the poor acting) the casting was also awful. The battles are as bad as they could possibly be.<br/><br/>Overall, my recommendation is to avoid this movie at all costs. I will repeat this: AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I think the movie would have been a lot better if the casting had been as follows: -Alexander - Dennis Rodman -His Father - Van Damme -His lover - Chuck Norris -His mother - Shaquille O'Neal (dressed as a woman) At least like this it would have been a better comedy, if their sole purpose was to mock this great story.

","I go into every film with an open mind. As someone who is going to be bold and sometimes cocky enough to express their opinion on film, you have be objective. When I was in transit to see the new Oliver Stone directed film Alexander, I was incredibly optimistic. After all Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and all coming out when the Oscar funny season begins, come on! So there I was in line, ready to hand out a five star rating like a large sized chocolate bar to the cutest kid on Halloween. Here's how it worked out.<br/><br/>Standing in line awaiting the theatre opening and watched the trailer for the movie on the various television screens that greet the paying customers  Five Stars.<br/><br/>Before movie began, Six (count 'em SIX!) commercials. One for Radio Shack, two car commercials, one for movietickets.com, one for Playstation 2, one for a rather large Mr. Big bar. Knowing that the movie was already just short of three hours and that I still had countless trailers to sit through, I was already getting perturbed. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4.5 Stars.<br/><br/>Credits roll almost 14 minutes later. See Oliver Stone's name and remember only his good films like Platoon, JFK, Salvador and Wall Street. Add ½ Star. Total = 5 Stars.<br/><br/>Hear Angelina Jolie's Elvira accent for the first time and it was enough to have me chuckle. Kilmer and Jared Leto's not much better. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4.5 Stars.<br/><br/>Watch as the young Alexander grows up and becomes the man that is played by Colin Farrell. Seeing Colin in the blond hair makes him look like a big Toy R Us doll. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4 Stars.<br/><br/>First 45 minutes spent telling us the history of the Alexander. His relationship with his mother. His budding relationship with his gay lover played by Leto, and his level of comfort around snakes. Lots of snakes. By the time the movie was over, I realized how drawn out and milked the Jolie was, how unnecessary towards understanding Alexander's motivation that the Leto character provides and how the snakes were probably brought by Ms. Voight herself just to get her to agree to play the role as Olympias. We see young Alexander tame a wild horse and are expected to believe that not only did he do this in sheer minutes, but it was also a sign that he would be a great ruler. Whatever. Minus one star. Total = 3 Stars.<br/><br/>First battle scene about to start and Alexander tries to rally the troops with an excessive speech. The speech wouldn't motivate me to shake my friends hand let alone lead me to lie down my life for a purpose. Thought back to Braveheart and how William Wallace's speech was inspirational. Longed for Braveheart. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.5 Stars.<br/><br/>The opening of the battle scene takes an eye view from a hawk in the sky. Incredible scene. Had me think of the trend setting Stone of yesteryear. Got heart pumping and ready for what was expected to be a bloody and lengthy battle. Add one star. Total = 3.5 Stars.<br/><br/>The battle begins and bodies and blood flow. People get stabbed, impaled, gauged, hammered and shot with arrows. But battle scene is under cloud of sand dust and the two sides are too hard to determine. People yell at each other, but couldn't figure out what they were yelling and trying to relay. Didn't know who I was rooting for. Battle scene was lengthy and well choreographed, but when the smoke cleared and the bodies lay on the battlefield, I still couldn't tell who lost more men. Add one star for the battles bloodbath, but minus one star for not knowing what was going on. Total = 3.5 Stars.<br/><br/>Alexander goes into Babylon where he takes a wife played by Rosario Dawson. She has a nude scene that made the final cut for one reason only. When the three hours were over, Dawson's character is one that I could have done without  or at least toned down to save me on crossing-the-leg-time (referring to trying to refrain from using the 'facilities'). Her accent too is casting couch-ish. Liked Dawson in The 25th Hour and thought she was rising talent. Uncertain of my previous judgment. Minus ½ Star. Total = 3.0 Stars.<br/><br/>Movie then goes back 8 years. BACK! Maybe inspired by Tarantino, Stone plays with the timeline for no apparent reason. The storyline tells us how his father was killed. Again, another 20 minutes that could have been shown in either a dream sequence or within the timeline in about 5 minutes. Thought it was out of place when story looked like it was getting momentum. Like playing snakes and ladders, we just hit a snake. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.5 Stars.<br/><br/>Listen to Colin give speech after speech. Don't really understand (or care) for his motivation. Can't really tell if his people are for him or against him. Beginning to get bored. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.0 Stars.<br/><br/>Get to India and another battle scene about to take place. It's in the jungle and I remembered how well Stone did last time he was in a jungle shooting (Platoon). Adjusted myself in my seat to get ready for the fast and furious. Battle begins and it is worse than the first. I have no idea who is stabbing who. I know the ones on the elephants are not on Team Alexander, but that is about as far as my referencing can go. Battle scene fought in red tones. Whaaa? Incredibly frustrated even though fake blood keeps hitting the camera lens. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.5 Stars.<br/><br/>Excellent scene where Alexander and his horse go on hind legs against an enemy and elephant doing same. Arrows fly, spears are thrown and Alexander falls. Scene is slow motion and was very memorable. Add ½ Star. Total = 2.0 Stars.<br/><br/>Alexander falls to ground and has one of Stone's dream collage sequences that were so out of place in Nixon and U-Turn. Don't get it. Don't need it. Don't want it. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.5 Stars.<br/><br/>Alexander is not dead however. Heals and becomes strong enough to make more speeches. His male lover lies dying in a bed and this seems to be the perfect time to star out at the city and talk about how great everything could be. Felt like I was being talked down to. Leto's character dies in the background and I don't care one bit. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.0 Stars.<br/><br/>Movie finally concludes with some overacting by Jolie. Anthony Hopkins who started the movie with a narration ends it with the conclusion to the Alexander saga. Was actually surprised that the movie did not feel like its 170+ running time suggested.

","""In you lives the light of this world. Your companions will long be shadows in the underworld, when you will be the one, forever young, forever inspiring - never will there be an Alexander like you - Alexander the Great."" Well, those are the words of Olympias, Alexander's mother (Jolie), but if this movie is any judge, then he should've been called Alexander the Boring. Or Alexander the Tedious. Perhaps Alexander the Way Too Talkative? You get the idea.<br/><br/>Folks, this movie is 3 hours long, and it makes sure you know it. It's been a while since I've wanted a movie to end so badly. I lost interest at the hour and a half mark and was near tears when I thought about how it was only halfway over. Still, I trudged forward, thinking the action would pick up a bit. ""There are bound to be a few more fight scenes coming up,"" I figured. Should've used the calculator on this one because I figured wrong.<br/><br/>Alexander conquered 90% of the known world, right? Well, I guess I just assumed that meant the movie would explore why he was such a great leader and warrior. Silly me. I wish I'd been warned that instead, this movie is about all the boring conversations he apparently had between battles.<br/><br/>There are only two battle scenes (the Battle of Gaugamela and the Battle of India). TWO! Many historians feel Alexander possessed the greatest military mind of all time, so two small battle scenes is unforgivable. The Battle of India was pretty cool with the armored elephants, but other than that things were really too fast and chaotic to get a grasp of what was going on. The bird's eye view was pretty cool though, and that's about the best I can say regarding the movie. Pretty sad, really.<br/><br/>What makes the movie so bad? Let's examine just a few details.<br/><br/>* The dialogue is embarrassingly bad at times. Anthony Hopkins actually has to use a line in which he states that Alexander never lost a battle except to Hephaistion's thighs. Or something like that. It's a reference to them wrestling as teenagers, but it's horribly awkward dialogue. Absolutely laughable.<br/><br/>* I don't care how realistic it is, but teenage boys wrestling in big diapers look ridiculous. The fact that we can see Alexander's big diaper under his army skirt is even worse.<br/><br/>* What is up with Alexander's hair? He has bad hair in every stage of life. It looks extremely fake, especially the bad dye job. The worst was the mullet. For a minute there I thought I was watching David Spade as Joe Dirt.<br/><br/>* A lot of controversy has surrounded the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion (Leto). I don't know if Alexander was actually bisexual, so I'm not really gonna speculate. I simply haven't researched the subject enough to know. But everybody involved with the movie claims that the relationship isn't really meant to be looked at in a sexual manner. Could've fooled me. The sappy dialogue between the two is painfully embarrassing, as evidenced by the theater audience's laughter. They hug, pledge their devotion to each other, use mock poetic language, etc. When Hephaistion told Alexander that he was the sun to him and that he was jealous of losing him to the world, all while undressing him with his eyes, I started to wonder what gay soap opera I had accidentally stumbled upon. Sorry, but that's not exactly what I want to see in what is supposed to be an epic war movie.<br/><br/>* Oliver Stone somehow failed at character development, despite the fact that he had three hours to work with. It would've been nice to know what exactly drove and inspired the characters. For example, Alexander sees Roxane (Rosario Dawson) dance and then the next thing you know they're getting married. Why did he choose her of all the women dancing? I don't know, nor will you after watching the movie.<br/><br/>* The love scene between Colin Farrell and Rosario Dawson is very strange. I kept expecting some wonka wonka porn music to start playing. When Farrell let out a little cat-like growl I shook my head and started to look around the theater for the exits.<br/><br/>* File ""Transvestite-Looking Men Belly Dancing For an Extended Period of Time"" under ""Scenes I Hope to Never See Again in Life."" Then to make it worse, Farrell kissed the guy afterwards. Sigh. Three hours, folks. Three hours I'll *never* get back. I'm WARNING you.<br/><br/>I could on, talking about the over-the-top acting, the messy editing, the lack of story cohesion, etc., but I've wasted enough of my time on this movie.<br/><br/>The biggest failure of Alexander is that after the credits rolled, I was left with the question, ""What exactly was the point of the movie?"" What exactly was Stone trying to accomplish? The subject is Alexander the Great, so why, after three hours, does Stone not give us any real insight into his military mind?<br/><br/>Why was Alexander so great? Stone just doesn't tell us. The movie gave me no reason to root for the guy. Anthony Hopkins' narration tells us his accomplishments, but the movie itself doesn't really show us what made him such a great conqueror.<br/><br/>Stone claims to have a great awe and respect for Alexander. If this is true, then why does he leave us with the impression that Alexander was a boring whiner? Why are we left scratching our heads in amazement that Alexander conquered the world?<br/><br/>I would say ""nice try,"" but I can't even give Mr. Stone that much credit. I doubt even Alexander himself could sit through this.<br/><br/>Rating: 2 (out of 5)"
"Juni78ukr","8","9","17","25 November 2004"," What are these people talking about? Alexander is a really good film.
","I was really frightened at this enormous quantity of bad reviews from almost all critics and here on IMDb. But anyway, this morning I went to a theater and watched this film on premiere screening. And now I simply can't understand that all these people are talking about and. Is Alexander a film horrible or bad? Definitely NOT. Is Alexander a good film? Definitely YES. Is Alexander a great film? Quite possibly. It is different and possibly controversial film but at the same time very intelligent and inspiring. It is incredibly difficult to describe this film so my review will be short. It's a three hours highlights (from childhood to death) of the life of the Alexander the Great. There is many dialogs or even monologues in this film, possibly too many for typical action film even for typical epic film. But all of these dialogs are wise, philosophical and inspiring and the most important they are so I don't see any reason to complain about it. Cinematography was excellent. Ancient Babylon and Alexandria were shown so impressive and splendidly. All landscapes and locations during the all film<br/><br/>were incredibly well selected. There are not too many battle scenes in Alexander but all of them (including elephant battle) were very well made with strong emotional core. About acting. I think here is the best Colin Farrell performance. He is very good as strong but flawed character. I'm don't so sure about Angelina Jolie but anyway it was her best performance for several years. After a miserable Lara Croft films she once again proves her acting ability. Val Kilmer also good as Alexander father Philip. But one of the best parts of this film was soundtrack written by Vangelis. The music was well selected, fresh and original. My grade 9 out of 10. I see here nominations for best picture, best cinematography, best original score and, of course, for visual and sound effects. Definitely I'll see it again after a few days.<br/><br/>I can't understand why so many people hate this film. I can find only two possible explanations. First: many people were offended by the fact that Alexander was shown as bisexual and his love to Hephaistion . Personally, I don't care was he a gay or not and I haven't found any offensive scene in this film. And the second possible explanation. There is a some conspiracy against this film. Only a month before most of critics and the studio said about possible awards and nominations and about the greatness of this film. WB moved the release date to November, 24 due to their high Oscars expectations. And suddenly all has been changing, the critics wrote these annoying C or even D reviews and people complain about the things that they don't even try to understand.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English."

","I liked this movie, a true masterpiece, I feel many people who saw it reacted to the movie the way people at Alexander reacted to his ideas, they just didn't get it, he was a man of visions, this movie is a visionary movie in a industry spawning typical stereotypical action heroes(Brad Pitts Achilles in Troy, Gerard Butlers Leonidas in the movie 300)Those faceless ""Heman"" characters when they eventually get deep they just get cheesy. What the auidiens get here is a deep but still ""visionary"" piece of art in the action scenes, the battle scenes against The Babelonians in the desert made me speechless, we see a flyover that is unique for this movie, still people complained, maybe they missed it when they concentrate to much in eating popcorn and candies while the movie go on, and there is also the fight in India when Alaxander(Xander we call him in Arabic countries)make a go for it against a armored elefant you feel the scene, not like in movies like LOTR Return of the King, where a bunch of silly confused video game elephants run around and roll on the ground.<br/><br/>The quest for the world is like the red line of the movie, he wants to be legend and to do something to the world, something good, he wants to learn preserve admire, unfortunately most of his men doesn't follow, neither do the audience, so that leaves this movie a master piece but only for those that understand art and the BIG PICTURE. It makes people wanna see more deep historical movies, read more books read more history. I guess this film will find more and more people in time, its a mystery like the legend himself, Alexander the Great, he was indeed different, if only our leaders today had his ideas or understandings and respect for culture and preservation of history and national treasures, this Directors cut versions will give the people who missed it a chance to truly see it for what it is and the ones who saw it a new look at it and see it deeper."

The accents are strange and variable. <br/><br/>There is no feeling that it is even attempting to portray the any sense of the period, except for the presence of Greek mythology in some of the dialog. The movie isn't quite epic, though it probably cost as much as an epic film. Even though it is lacking in historical value and reference, I thought it could have been fun as an epic.

","It's hard to see what this movie was trying to be. The script is written as bad soap opera and cycles repeatedly through 3 scenes: battle, quiet reflection, loud speech. Over and over and over. There isn't much else to it.<br/><br/>The characters - even Alexander & Aristotle - are flat. The moments of potential drama - meetings between powerful kings, great battles, Alex and his mom or dad - are reduced to shouting matches.<br/><br/>The movie itself is overdone and overblown. Ferrell makes a speech about nearly everything. One expects he might answer at the table ""Oh yes, by the gods and by Zeus who defeated the Titans and dwells on high; by all these and all I hold dear; by the blood that I spill from these very veins; yes, yes I will hand up the salt shaker ...""<br/><br/>Nothing is subtle, giving rise to the soap opera feel: long looks, pointed stares, 100s of clichés. Ferrell is the worst, all strutting and rapid eye movements and shouting and glaring. Plummer is dull; Dawson and Jolie overact until it's painful.<br/><br/>The story is impossible to follow, even before it starts jumping around in time.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are different and intense. And as gory as one might like, especially when they fight the army that's on elephants and chop off some trunks and legs.<br/><br/>Alexander the man is the stuff of legend. This movie doesn't do anything for him."
"frisbee006","1","5","8","21 December 2005"," worst movie I've ever seen
","Okay, first of the all the sound guy must have been sick because you can barely hear dialogue which you later find out was actually important. We had to turn on the subtitles. The movie starts out something like 30 years after Alexander...then it goes 20 years back, 10 years back, 20 forward, 30 back, 10 forward, goes back a week, forward three days and by then you have no clue what the heck has been going on. You really don't know where or when you are in the movie. Now, at one point in the movie there's a battle scene. Obviously there should be one since he sort of conquered a good bit of the known world. Well, weren't not quite sure if there really was a battle scene though because all you see is a massive cloud of dust. There were some horses running in there but they might have been just passing through. If they were on one side or another, we'll never know. Oh, and don't forget that Alexander is gay. We do know that in Greek times it was acceptable for this kind of behavior, but I was unaware of the extent of his homosexuality until now-and by now I mean the point when I get to see Colin Ferrel's butt (plus a little more) when he's crawling into bed with another man. Battlefield Earth was the number 1 worst movie I had ever seen...until I saw this. Don't waste your time"

Great actors, huge budget and a hero's bio to work with, how else could this movie have been thrown in the trash?<br/><br/>First, let's talk about some of the good things about this film. 1) Great CG effects and battle sequences. Maybe a little too graphic, but great for people who are into bloody war sequences. 2) Somehow kept me watching, although I hated it.<br/><br/>Now for the bad things. Well - there was a lot. 1) the cast. Paid the wrong people to do the job. What was up with there accents? I would have rather seen a subtitled version of the movie. 2) If you've read any of the passed reviews, you would already know about the terrible chronology. Someone stated it perfectly, ""It's like watching this movie with the reels all mixed in the wrong places."" Wow, what a disaster. 3) Although the homosexuality of the Greek culture is true to history, that's not what Alexander the Great was about. He wasn't ""Great"" because he was a homosexual or whatever the director was trying to portray. He was great for a lot of historical events that the director chose not to include to fit in boring, useless homosexual sequences.<br/><br/>There are worse things about this movie, but I'm not going to waste my time. Don't see it, there is a more interesting biography on his life on the History Channel. And if what you want to see it the battle sequences, watch Troy or the Last Samurai."
"don-in-japan","3","5","8","15 September 2005"," Simply Awful.
","More evidence that Oliver Stone continues to provide over-the-top crap. Way over-dramatized, over-acted, and overdone. Factually inaccuracies can be put down to artistic license, but Stone's love affair with pomp & ceremony just get ridiculous in this poor attempt at an epic. From the very opening minute to the end of Anthony Hopkin's final soliloquy, Stone seems at a loss as to how to make this work. Perhaps that's unfair: not the opening minute - Brian Blessed's performance as the 'Wrestling Trainer' was one of the few stand-outs. How Oliver Stone manages to realize such histrionic performances from such storied actors is truly testament to his lack of vision. Given the strength of the actors that are involved in the production, one can only assume that the blame lies squarely with Stone's direction. If you feel the urge to watch this movie - Do yourself a favour, just say 'no'."

","First of all I went into this with low expectations because of what I had heard from critics and friends. But I figured I would watch it and make up my own mind because you can never really trust someone else as to what you like or dislike. Well in this case they were right because I struggled on and off for 3 hours whether I should get up and leave. <br/><br/>This is a bad movie. It is not even a bad movie because of all the gratuitous man love but because it drags on and on for way too long just barely keeping you interested every 45 minutes with cool battle scenes. Every time I would begin rolling my eyes and seriously contemplate walking out, something would happen where I would think ""okay well maybe now I can give it chance again."" It never happened. The entire film was a roller-coaster of emotion - in a bad way. I would be bored and disappointed for 30 minutes and then would say ""Ahhh those special effects look pretty good."" <br/><br/>After viewing the film I wanted my 3 hours back and felt like writing Oliver Stone a letter and asking him what happened.

"rochellew25","8","8","15","29 November 2004"," I thought this movie was pretty good!!!
","OK so i am more than likely the minority here, but i thought Alexander was a good movie. I thought Colin did a good job acting out the part of Alexander. It was a little long and the narration got on my nerves. I liked the music, and all the symbolism. I thought Oliver Stone did a good job on Alexander being Bisexual. I think it is sad that we live in a time were we have to dance around subjects. On each love seen between Jarod and Colin I could hear the audience getting antsy. That stuff does not bother me, so I just watched while everyone else looked away. Angelina was not in the movie enough. I thought she did an OK job, but was shown enough. Overall I thought the movie was good. I like that Colin showed his emotions throughout the movie, and was not just mister tough guy. I would encourage you to see this movie, and make up your own mind. It was worth the ticket."
"bitemeaustria","9","8","15","26 November 2004"," Much, MUCH better movie than the critics are telling you.
","I just returned from seeing Oliver Stone's ""Alexander."" To be completely honest, I really have nothing but praise for the movie. The acting ranged from solid to excellent (Farrell was a perfect cast for Alexander)and I stayed entertained throughout the entire three hours. The only gripe I have was that the score was weak, but who really cares when you consider the movie as a whole? I think it's also necessary to comment on the fact of how historically accurate the film was. The story was right on until the end, which had it's own special twist, but made a point to stick to history along with it. Overall, I'd say ""Alexander"" was nothing short of fantastic. As usual, the critics stuck their noses in the air and gave it a ""thumbs-down"" just because it didn't send some watered down indie film message about life.<br/><br/>The newspaper and television reviews of this movie basically come down to the fact that the critics are out of touch with today's audiences."
"houndblack","10","8","15","26 November 2004"," Excellence.
","Despite a three hour running time, Alexander is well worth the money. It is a given that Oliver Stone would have to make changes to fit this story into a movie. Alexander's life was over 30 years long, after all. Somehow I doubt we'd all want to sit through a movie THAT long.<br/><br/>Though I was disappointed that some of the scenes I'd wanted to see were either skipped over entirely or just filled in with narration by Anthony Hopkins, what we got was more than enough to satisfy me. The battle scenes, especially Gaugaumela, were epic as expected; Oliver Stone used more extras for the battles than most of his counterparts do now, and I think it showed. The dialogue did seem a bit overacted at times, but it wasn't a major detraction for me. I think the film is comparable to (or even better than) Troy.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting issues in the film lay with Alexander's personality. I won't go into detail, but if you see the film, expect some surprises that you might not expect to see on the big screen.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I believe this story should stand out as one of the best films of the year, though that's probably the history major in me speaking. (And this probably guarantees that it won't do well...) Just remember, as I did...take what you see with a grain of salt. Enjoy the story for what it is. If you are further interested, go out and learn more about it.<br/><br/>After all, he was real. And his story lives on.<br/><br/>(The reviews have been pretty awful so far as you will have all seen, but Harry Knowles, much loved by many of the people we would expect to hate this movie, may have just given it a massive boost. His review on AICN is great. He has really stuck his neck out and seen the film from a very clever point of view.)"
"dauntlessnessdragon","10","8","15","26 November 2004"," Some thoughts on a Great film.
","Someone else posted on this list and it reads: ""I've had another day to think about it, and the one question that keeps popping into my mind is: What was this movie about? And I mean that in the most general sense.""<br/><br/>I have to admit that, after a day and night of thinking about what I posted yesterday, I've come to the conclusion that it is I who have the problem, not Oliver Stone. And that I've spoken too quickly. I have to give him all the credit in the world for attempting to put into movie form an incredible life that has been unmatched in 2,300 years. A life that changed the rest of history. In a way, it is Oliver Stone who is leading a heroic life, following his dream, and sticking to it, no matter what the odds. And how hubristic of me to even suggest that he do something different with editing or writing HIS film. I've never written a film, I've never edited a film, so what the hell do I know. I feel a little guilty for blurting out criticism in such a cavalier manner. My only defense is that I think maybe we've all been ""pulling"" for this movie to be the biggest, most successful movie of all time. And attempting analysis of ""why this, and why that"" after seeing this tremendous effort get blasted by critics is more indicative my own thin skin. Perhaps Oliver doesn't give a flying fig if it's successful or not. He's obviously happy with the movie he made, so perhaps I should just step back and take a look at it as HE is trying to tell it, rather than the way I wanted to hear it. Know what I mean? He has so much to be proud of with this film, and I, for one, am happy with that. <br/><br/>Also having thought about the performances of actors, crew, etc: Here is a man who lead the entire ""army"" of people to make this film, and got them to follow him to do the near impossible. I stopped seeing ""Colin Farrell"" but saw ""Alexander""....Farrell ""inhabited"" the role, he became Alexander. From all accounts, he doesn't put any stock in the ""celebrity status"" he has achieved, and has kept a level head on his shoulders through all the nonsense he's had to put up with in publicizing the film. His willingness to give it his all, he became the leader of his men on set, rather than just one of the lads. Few actors can project that transformation to the audience convincingly. Living in Los Angeles, I have seen a lot of ""movie star groupies""--I consider myself the farthest thing from that, so forgive how this must sound... There is a magnetism about him that was probably so evident to Oliver Stone. It was a brilliant casting decision to have Farrell become Alexander for this film. He needed an actor who could ""check his ego at the door"", follow his director's directing, and change himself to show all emotional levels-confidence, anger, happiness, hope, leadership, weariness, fortitude in the face of danger, kindness, and ""become"" a man who has not been matched in over 2300 years. <br/><br/>It is a hard thing to live up to an image we have imagined all these years. I began my journey with Alexander the Great when I made a business decision to create and market the latest in my series of ""Perfumes of Antiquity"" based on the essences he would have found in his empire. It has been, and always will be a personally rewarding journey as well. In my research, I realized how strong the image of Alexander truly has been throughout history. Well, enough out of me. I hope everyone on this list has a chance to see the film very soon, and see it again and again. There is so much packed into this film...at least one or two viewings will be needed just to concentrate on all that is in the sets, costumes, art direction, etc. Enjoy!"

","I am glad that Oliver was true to the story. It's too bad others have not been accepting of it. I have read some observations of the film over historical-realated sites. Now, there is a bunch who know ATG, well. They have actually been positive about the film and they were a bunch of people who were very afraid that Stone would do a hack job. They are surprised at how well he did. So the people that know the subject really liked the film. That means that he didn't make it or compromise it for the MTV generation. I am glad that he did not. Unfortunately I wish the general public ""got it"", but the critics didn't and just passed their negativity onto the general public.<br/><br/>There is almost no wasted *dialogue*. Most of it is essential, although they did sometimes repeat the same basic thought in two different wordings, so the SCRIPT could have been cut down, making shorter scenes, and thus leaving room for another scene or two."

","They wasted a lot of money making this epic? film.<br/><br/>I don't know whether it was bad acting, a bad script, or a combination of the two, but it mostly didn't work. Then there's the fact that the historic Alexander was blond, and Colin Farrell isn't. During the first part of the film, his blond hair looked like nothing more than a really, really bad wig. Then, in the scenes in Babylon, when his hair was long and parted it was better. Unfortunately, the many close-ups of his face revealed a heavy black shadow, if not stubble. This was a serious distraction. In a few scenes, he was clearly recently clean-shaved, and looked okay, but only a few THey should have hired a real blond to play the role.<br/><br/>I won't even waste time on the overly long battle scenes.

"sssfk16","2","3","4","10 February 2014"," A Second Viewing Doubles My Original Rating
","I wrote a review for this film 10 years ago when I first saw it. It wasn't a good review, it was childish, petty, and filled with self- righteousness. What can I say, I was young, was looking forward to the movie, and had just had my spirit crushed. I acknowledge the follies of my youth, so when I saw that the movie was going to be on HBO I decided to give it another look.<br/><br/>To start, I should say that I'm fascinated by the story of Alexander the Great - I know the history and the legends. That might bias me simply because it's a huge and wonderful narrative from which to draw and make a film. It's also one of the main reasons I still hate this film. I couldn't even make it all the through the second viewing.<br/><br/>Let's back away from that for the moment. There's some good historical stuff in it. I like that Alexander's outfit is detailed on the Pompeii mosaic, that soldiers appear to be wearing linothorax, and the imagination that went into the battle scenes and the portrayal of the Persian empire with all its ethnicities. At the same time, some things were just ridiculous and distracting, but enough reviewers have already gone through those.<br/><br/>My real problem is that Oliver Stone doesn't really tell any story and actually seems completely schizophrenic given a wealth of material. It starts out with Alexander's troubled relationship with his father and mother yet this seems to completely disappear by the second half of the film. This pattern repeats with various other narratives. Is it a love story with Hephaestion? Is it a story of curiosity and adventure? Is it a story of conquest? Is it a story of Alexander questioning his mortality? Alexander as philosopher? Alexander as Achilles? The film briefly goes in each of these directions, only to be jerked back in the next couple scenes. The flashbacks don't serve to inform the audience of Alexander's character, they muddle it, and as far as I can tell are primarily used to simplify a narrative taking place over 20 years.<br/><br/>So here's the crux. If this was an original story it might be able to come off as some artsy epic with its own meaning. Unfortunately it's not. The story of Alexander already has meaning and therefore this Alexander comes off as completely underwhelming and much less interesting than nearly any other telling. Watch the BBC's ""In the Footsteps of Alexander,"" a documentary that follows a historian along Alexander's route. Without any reenactments a character is brought to life, his motives explored, and his legacy displayed 2250 years after his death."

WRONG !!!! this movie was really bad. i'm usually into similar films like this such as gladiator, kingdom of heaven, 300 and Cleopatra so i'm not criticising this film because of when the film is set. its just the whole flow of the film, it was very boring.<br/><br/>i still think Oliver Stone is a brilliant director except for a few blunders like the world trade centre, born on the fourth of July and this film. i hope he makes a change in his directing techniques and makes some classics in the future. watch this film if you dare......... 2/10........j.d Seaton"
"fearfulofspiders","1","3","4","12 September 2008"," Terrible...
","First off, I must thank the high-heavens that the idiots involved with this film did not add ""the Great"" to the title, so that those of us who can only pray someone makes a film that lives up to the title of one of, if not, the greatest rulers this world has ever had.<br/><br/>There's no defensible reason to how this film could possibly be considered ""good"". From the acting to the score, Alexander is full of awfulness that makes it so deservingly awarded the title of The Worst Picture of the Year.<br/><br/>There is not one character fit for the role they play. Angelina Jolie seems to have never aged, Val Kilmer (an actor I tend to like) delivers a lot of ham, Jared Leto seems to be lost, and Colin Farrel acts as if he belongs on a daytime soap. Homosexuality being set to the side, Leto and Farrel play probably the most androgenic characters of the decade, there is no subtlety to them, and if I saw one more shoulder-massage, I was gonna shriek. Anthony Hopkins' usage in the film is such a crime, Oliver Stone should serve some time.<br/><br/>The writing and directing is so lackluster and cheap, that no matter how much money went into this project, it was a destined failure. When having Oliver Stone, Hollywood's biggest hack, sign on as the director and writer is an idea far worse than any other this film faced. While I really enjoyed Conan the Barbarian, and hated Scarface, the end result leans to the latter so much, it breaks the balance beam. The dialogue is awful, as our characters speak in paragraphs (sometimes it seems like essays) worth of words, rather than sentences that get to the point. The moments between Leto and Farrel on the balcony is so laughable, I had to question whether anyone set out to make a good film, or just garbage.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are, as sincere as I can be, despicable. From the, once again, huge dialogue moments of battle speeches, to the most fake CG hawk flying over the vistas, everything is ridiculous. Stone tries to make an artsy film, where there's intense closeups of the protagonists and antagonists, while the music soars with no real complexity. The beginning fight is comprised more of Alexander's nonsensical speech than it is of fighting, and when the battle does erupt, it is so sloppily edited, that the entire team deserves Razzies. Other artsy moments on Stone's part are the scenes in Babylon, and the various other battle sequences that have no inspiration to them... just ""lame"" written across everyone's foreheads. Alexander trots across the front ranks of his army, telling how he remembers each of them, and the soldiers shake their spears in the air, as if this is suppose to add some gravitas to the mood.<br/><br/>The music is one I'd toss out the window, because it is so dull and unoriginal, that seeing it clatter and shatter on the pavement would be the single greatest achievement this film could ever have dreamed of obtaining. Vangelis seems to be a terrible choice, even if his only real claims to fame cling to Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner, this score still goes in the trash.<br/><br/>The special effects, like the hawk mentioned earlier, are terrible. To avoid any depth in the creation of the armies, we see humongous wide shots, where everything seems like an ant, and you cannot tell which army is which. A poor decision, but it isn't surprising based on the rest of this travesty. Also, when the archers fire numerous volleys, the arrows fly and are launched with such lazy effect... I questioned once more the intentions of this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, Alexander is such a fiasco of such wretchedness, I cannot recommend it to anyone. It is so bad and such a waste of millions of dollars, that there is no redeemable factor. No one does a fine job, not even the people behind the camera. This is just one, big, epic-fail."

","My title about describes the entire motion picture. I have seen few movies as dull and uneventful as this one. This was a movie I had wanted to see since I had seen the promotions came out. I was in the theater with a group of about 10 friends. When we walked out no one really said anything to one another so I spoke up that I would have left in the middle of the movie if I had been there by myself. The rest I found out would have followed along.<br/><br/>A little bit about the movie. The movie was very poorly made and carried out far too long. Every time Alexander was hurt I was left feeling that the ending was near but became more dismayed after each time the movie carried on and on. The acting lacked any passion and heart to say the least, which probably led to part of my dislike for the film. Each scene seemed to blur into the next leading to false climaxes and a lack of a clear dramatic ending that a film like this deserves.<br/><br/>Don't bother with this nonstop sleeper."
"ach65559","10","3","4","15 August 2007"," Alexander Revisited is the film Stone wanted us to see.Bloody, beautiful and brilliant.
","Perhaps my above summary of the final version of Oliver Stone's much maligned and previously much mucked about Alexander may seem over the top.If you've seen the theatrical version and/or the so - called Director's Cut, you ain't seen nothing'yet! I'm a great admirer of Mary Renault's Alexander Trilogy and Robin Lane Fox's Alexander The Great( the result of a lifetime's research by the Oxford history professor who was Stone's chief historical adviser for the film). If you think I'm overrating Stone's meticulously researched,wonderfully well acted and beautifully photographed movie,read Fox's review and article on Wikipedia's entry for Alexander The Great( links ). If you haven't read any of the Renault trilogy(for me she's almost clairvoyant in her uncanny ability to evoke Alexander and his times, especially Book 2 The Persian Boy ( the story of Bagoas, Alexander's eneuch - related as a personal memoir )I urge you to give it a try.It's far superior to the more recent trilogy by the Italian writer Valerio Manfredi, though the translators may be at fault here- but I doubt it. As for Alexander Revisited, please don't judge Stone's movie till you've seen this final 3and a half hour version for yourself.I hope you'll enjoy it this time around."
"mOVIemAN56","2","3","4","16 May 2007"," So bad. I'm speechless.
","I was just able to catch another Oliver Stone film, this time it was Alexander. Let me just say, I want 3 hours of my life back. I can't begin to explain how pitiful Alexander truly is. It is just cinema and Hollywood at its worst. It was like watching a horror film. It just shook me up but not in a good way. I was told before hand I'd be stunned. I was stunned, stunned that Oliver Stone directed this piece of garbage, totally inaccurate film that I was told was better then Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven.<br/><br/>The film is suppose to tell us the story of Alexander the Great, one of the greatest military commanders and kings to ever exist. The film follows from young prince to death. We are taken across Macedonia, Asia Minor and Asia. We see the major battles of Gaugamela and Hydaspes. We also are taken into a mental look of Alexander. All is fine and well when this is read on paper but when you see it done on screen, its awful.<br/><br/>Everything is way overblown. I know they are fighting in the desert at Gaugamela but for God's sake the audience wants to see the battle not just a giant dust cloud. The acting reminded me of watching a silent film from the 1910's with every character reacting overly traumatic to an action. The sets are so unbelievable. Yes this was the golden age of the Macedonian Empire but nothing was built or looked perfectly as Stone wants us to believe with every set shown.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is not a bad actor when given the right material. He is, however, a terrible Alexander the Great. I believe it is more of the character Stone wanted him to be, not Farrell himself. There are so many changes in personality for Alexander, from gay to straight, quiet and naive to inspirational and powerful, to scared and upset to determined and all mighty that eventually you start taking bets on what his next mood swing will be and what side he'll show. Now I'm sure the real life Alexander had some personal problems but if he saw how he was portrayed in this he'd probably be drawing up plans to invade Hollywood.<br/><br/>I've lost almost all hope in Oliver Stone. His films are gradually deteriorating into boring and overblown pieces, nothing like Platoon was. Everything looks to fancy and neat. The costumes are too new, the people are too handsome, the battles are too choreographed. Stone's dialog is bland, boring, and thoughtless. There is either no emotion behind a speech or too much emotion. I can't begin to count how many times Farrell goes to the verge of tears when talking to someone.<br/><br/>I honestly have never seen a worse biopic or historical drama. Nothing made sense. I couldn't tell what part of the story was going on with the constant flashbacks and flash forwards. The whole presence of Anthony Hopkins was totally unnecessary and boring. It just added wasted minutes onto the film. The film is so dry at moments I would fall asleep and wake up and they'd still be talking. Of the 2 hours and 55 minutes there is about 30 minutes of battle and 40 minutes of Alexander crying. Good job Stone. You really should think about whether you should ever direct again. I would say no.<br/><br/>1/5 Stars"
"attackedbymars","1","3","4","9 March 2007"," wow!
","For people who believe that his movie is good in any way, shape or form. You my friends, are wrong. I'm only going to address one very solid and monumental flaw of this movie. Oliver Stone did not portray the character of Alexander, or the Greeks one bit.<br/><br/>Alexander the Great conquered most of the known world at his time. This great warrior was not a man who would cry in the arms of another person in the eve of battle. He would of girded his loins and prepared for the shed of blood and cries of battle.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone only showed a coward who feared death. Not for the glory of the movie but to make people uncomfortable. This is why Oliver Stone road out the fact that the Greek culture was a sexually open culture, free to have sex with whomever they please. He drove this fact into the ground and beyond. You only saw them as lovers as boys when these frivolous men loved whomever they desired. Oliver Stone only pushed his own agenda and did not care for the reality which was Alexander the Great and the Greeks of his time."
"sexynfreakay","1","3","4","3 January 2007"," horrendous and utterly takes one on highway to boredom
","This movie was one of the worst movies of 2004! Its not that I do not appreciate history I do but Oliver Stone forgot what movie making is first and foremost about-to entertain! I saw the movie at a theatre and left half-way through the duration. The storytelling, acting and directing left a lot to desire for. Angelina Jolie clearly tried to give another Oscar-winning performance such as in Girl Interrupted but miserably fell short. As for Colin Farrell I sincerely believe he needs to re-enrol into acting school! Oliver Stone is a much much better director than he has displayed through Alexander and I certainly expected more from a director of his pedigree. Watch Alexander if you're having trouble sleeping its better than diazepan or valium!"
"e-tzimisces","1","3","4","23 December 2006"," A Waste of Film
","The entire movie was contrived and fake. Colin Farrell turned an amazing historical figure into a whining, pedantic child of 34. How could someone like him get beyond his own pettiness to conquer an empire? There is no depth to any of the characters. It was as if everyone got together to play dress up and pretend. Some scenes (monkeys come to my mind) were over the top and bordered on the ridiculous. Angelina Jolie didn't play the mother of a king but the shrew wife of a drunk who went to the Borat School of Diction. Not only was the acting the absolute WORST I've seen from so called *professional* actors, but the movie was so long and boring. I fell asleep through it at the movies. I tried to give it a second chance on TV but couldn't do it. What did they put in the Kool=Aid on set? Each actor has made good films before, but it's like they all ganged up to make the worst one here. HORRIBLE, save the $4.50 you'll pay for PPV or at Blockbuster."
"plepo","2","3","4","6 November 2006"," What? Wait...who...when...ummm...OK?
","I have only seen the Director's Cut on DVD, so maybe that is the source of my problem, but after three viewings I still have no idea what this movie is about. I mean, the movie claims it's about Alexander and as I recall there was a character named Alexander in the film. However, the name seems to be the only similarity between this character and the historical figure. This Alexander couldn't stand up to a grape embargo, much less the Persian Army. Still, the movie is called Alexander and Oliver Stone swears that it is really about Alexander, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and attempt to get through this.<br/><br/>Here's what I have been able to piece together after 3 viewings: Colin Farrell is Alexander born of Phillip the insanely ugly and Queen Angelina Jolie who apparently had an excellent cosmetic surgeon that kept her pretty much the same age for decades. The cost of these procedures may explain why she moonlights as a snake charmer.<br/><br/>At some point our man Alex does...something...which apparently irks the Persian guy which leads up to the ""climatic"" first battle to decide once and for all who is the goofier king. Oh wait, there's a Persian Guy that is King of Persiayou have to piece that together on your own a bit but the movie does provide some clues to help. Anywho, Persian guy is clearly going with his guy in a dress and too much makeup cabaret act, while Alexander is banking on a bad Mel Gibson impersonation. This of course is left unfinished so Alex goes to Babylon to moan and whine to his Not-Boyfriend Jared Leto.<br/><br/>After awhile, Alex and his entourage of special makeup effects test subjects go to...that other place that could be modern day Pakistan, or the Russian Steppes but could also be rural Indiana for all we know and there they kill a whole lot of guys that may live there...or perhaps were lost. Overall those guys just die and it really doesn't matter cause the drag queen King of Persia is dead and you can't possibly care. Oh and Alex gets hitched, which seems to make the Snake Queen back home upset but again caring about it is also not in the cards. Oh and Alex sleeps with a eunuch but clearly and pointedly does not sleep with his Not-Boyfriend Jared Leto. The film cannot stress enough how much Alexander does not sleep with his Not-Boyfriend Jared Leto. At least 12 to possibly as much as 2,000 hours of the film are dedicated to this fact alone.<br/><br/>OK, so then they go to India and your heart soars because you actually know where they are for a moment. Then there are snakes (possible agents of Queen Angelina? You make the call) and one of the guys that hangs out with Alex gets run through with a spear by Alex but you really don't know who he is and you care even less. Then Alex gets beat up by an Elephant, goes back to Babylon and dies. Was he poisoned like his Not-Boyfriend may have been? Who knows, we're 47,000 hours into this film and don't have time for another sub-plot. Cut to the obligatory old British actor (Tony ""Can I have my money now"" Hopkins) who was cast in the role of Tony Hopkins for a futile attempt to explain the last 273,159.25 hours of the film. Role Credits...wake up audience...dispose of the bodies of the people who literally died of boredom or perhaps took their own life favoring suicide over this filmdistribute pamphlets and suggested reading material to further illustrate that Alexander at no time during this film slept with his Not-Boyfriend Jared Letoset up for the next showing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can only imagine that Mr. Stone made a decision very early in the filming process that the story was none of our business. Assuming that was in fact his goal, he managed to succeed in stealing at least 1.2 Million hours of my life without actually trying. Way to go Ollie! I give it 2 out of 10 and not a 1 based mostly on...well...Oliver Stone's prior work...or maybe...well it was shorter than Titanic...the Persian guy made me laugh...there...that's it."
"IsabelDan","1","3","4","9 August 2006"," Farcical
","Not anywhere near the epic that Oliver Stone had been or should have been aiming for, but a loose, misguided and swollen mess of a production. I am led to believe that the cast raided some eccentric's hideous vintage costume collection, stole as much as they could, along with a dozen or two animal hides and put on an absurd play. A movie about one of the greatest conquerors in history should be nothing less than sweeping and memorable. Instead, it is a boring, plodding and jumbled disappointment. It looks as if Colin Farrell woke up one day in the land of Alexander, and we painfully watch him try to figure out what's happened to him. In the midst of this, there's Anthony Hopkins popping up on and off, lecturing us to sleep; Angelina laughably improbable as a full-on sorceress with a poorly made-up accent; and the goofiest sex scene the world's ever witnessed. The overly decorated set and costumes were brimming with tackiness; so stuffed was the set that I was afraid some of it might spill over. Alexander is a miscast disaster in the hands of a clueless director."
"rbrb","1","3","4","16 July 2006"," What A Bunch of Hammy Drama Queens!
","This movie must rate in any top ten as one of the worst of all time.<br/><br/>The lead actor is totally mis-cast and he and others have broad Irish accents which in the context of playing a Greek Conquerer is a farce! Everything about this film is wrong: The script is nonsense and overlong; the direction and editing is wholly uneven and feeble, looking like it was put together by a bunch of autistic school children.<br/><br/>And there is so much else erroneous about this pic, it ain't worth my bother listing them all.....<br/><br/>Most importantly, the real Alexander was a gay but him and his lovers are playing their parts like a bunch of closest Queens which may or may not have been the true scenario in real life but it comes over in the film as a comedy.<br/><br/>As to the actress playing the mother: like something out of a Drag Queen show; and the father with his one eye is played by an actor seemingly more music hall than serious....and as for Anthony Hopkins.....plays the part like an aging never has been.......<br/><br/>Dear oh dear, what a load of absolute rubbish! 1/10."
"RNHunter","4","3","4","12 January 2006"," Hard to Believe
","I have never been a world conqueror nor am I even well read on the subject. However, I felt cheated in this movie. To be sure it had its good scenes and may still be worth watching. However, I did not think it met with common sense on what I would expect from a world conqueror.<br/><br/>If Alexander the Great did conquer more than half of the known world, one would expect him to be a reasonably tough individual. And yes, perhaps one that would also seem a little mean at times to some people. Driven people who conquer other nations I believe are tough individuals. In this case, Alexander just seems too soft. One is led to believe that people wanted to be conquered. Sorry, that is just too far fetched. Instead of a tough individual such as Russell Crowe in the Gladiator, we seem to have instead the ""Stay-puffed marshmallow man"" as depicted in the movie ""Ghostbusters"". Sorry, too hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Yes, driven people at times did try to conquer the world. But I would like movies to be fair and treat all of these conquerors as they should - tough individuals. It is now hard to find a copy of the old movie El Cid in DVD form in the US. However, in it, a warrior leader named Ben Yusef tries to conquer Europe. Now this portrayal is anything but the ""stay-puffed marshmallow man"". Ben Yusef scares me. But one also thrills to the terror of his forces and his leadership. Likewise, Shaka Zulu, in the movie of the same name, also clearly was not someone to be trifled with. I think those examples are what a world conqueror would really be like. My opinion."
"Umar Mansoor Bajwa","6","3","4","9 January 2006"," An over acted Movie !
","First of all, it is recorded history authenticated by the historical murals/bas reliefs and paintings of Hellenistic times, that Alexander the Great did not sport long hippie style hairs. It is a farce to depict him in such visage that does not hold true.<br/><br/>Some of the very firm historical facts like Alexander died a natural death at Babylon, Mesopatamia by malaria or high fever have been distorted. Besides, established contemporary history makes no mention of Alexander fighting with Monkey tribes in India. During his Indian advance, the first major battle was fought with the Indian King Porus whose forces outnumbered the Hellenistic army. Howsoever, Alexander won, and magnanimously returned the entire conquered territory to the Indian king, much to the contempt and heartburning of his native Greeks. Besides, the manner, in which Alexander's mother Olympia is shown to connive in the murder of King Philip also does not conform to established historical evidences. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that besides some improvement in the script, facial expressions concerning emotional intensity does not match to those of Charlton Heston as shown in BEN-HUR. The directional skills of William Wyler were definitely head and shoulders above those we witness in ""Alexander"" of Oliver Stone."
"tomimt","5","3","4","27 November 2005"," Shoddy work
","Alexander has all the element of a great epic movie. It has massive battles, beautiful locations and re-created cities from the past. That's why it's rather disappointing, that the film is ruined whit poor editing and shattered narration.<br/><br/>Biggest flaw of the film is, that it's really hard to identify with anyone: all characters just drift along the given time scape whit only definitive center point of Alexanders world conquest. Then there's the build up of tension of the story which is strangely enough done in very late part of the movie, which is far too late, when placed in the context of the movie's length. <br/><br/>The movie cost 150 million dollars or so. It shows in the massive scenes, but then there are some scene, which look poorly and shoddily made. Most of the scenes with Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) look extremely fake. Also some of the CGI'ed camera drives on the battle fields are ridden with such problems. And speaking of battles, some of the scenes are rather fuzzy, so it's sometimes hard to tell what's going on.<br/><br/>I did find it strange, that all the characters spoke with poorly selected accents, as they didn't serve any bigger purpose and sounded rather awkward. It wouldn't have mattered if EVERYONE would have used a accent, but there was lots of characters who didn't use an accent or used different accent even though they were from the same place as the others.<br/><br/>My final nail to the review: Music. Sure, I like Vangelis. I have Blade Runner soundtrack. But Alexander's soundtrack is very unfit for the film. It mostly creates wrong atmosphere for the situations.<br/><br/>There are some great scenes in the film, but as I said it felt shoddily done and, I even dare to say, in some places it was quite amateurish. And that was pretty odd."
"grahamsj3","4","3","4","27 September 2005"," Alexander Great, Movie Stink
","This film was poorly written and directed. I was bored several times by overly long dialog leading to absolutely nothing. The battle scenes, called epic by some, are just plain too dang long. If epic means too long, then they are indeed epic. I felt that his mother had far too many scenes after he became grown and had taken off on his conquests. She wasn't adding anything necessary to the film in those scenes, so why keep them? There was definitely bisexuality in Alexander's relationships and it wasn't skipped over at all. Historically it seems to have been fairly accurate, and Alexander's story is a true classic. However, inept adaptation to the big screen along with uncharacteristically poor direction from Oliver Stone, lead to a film that is not only disappointing, but downright poor. Boring, boring, boring. I'm afraid this film just doesn't live up to all of it's hype."
"medlynn","5","3","4","31 August 2005"," What a mess!
","This movie is all over the place. Could have been a very good epic,but Stone decided to put 10 hours of film into 2 1/2 and must have been a little high when he did it. Still better than Troy. Asian sycophants? Monkey warriors? 'Failure towers over a mans success's'. Stone will forever be anchored by this. Why was Alexander surprised by Elephants in India. Supposedly he used them to cross the Alps. All kinds of nonsense in this movie. Watch at your own risk.This 10 line stuff is for the birds.

","The DVD copy I watched had a commentary from director Stone and it perhaps explained the slow pace of such a potentially exciting film. He talks at length of the collaboration with European producers and the 1950s ""Toga and Sandals"" feel comes through really strongly. The most telling comment was that we know nothing of the man Alexander other than some comments put down three hundred years after he died. So this movie is a characterisation based on a guess.<br/><br/>Stone seems to let his actors ramble on and use whatever dialect they like to give them authenticity. Angelina Jolie's mock Greek-accented English is a failure and detracts from her performance. <br/><br/>I look forward to this story being told by a better director and acted by better actors with some hint of historical accuracy. A great opportunity lost."

","Rather than go into a summary of this picture (since many have before this writing), I am going to sum this up quickly: Pitiful. Nothing is redeemable about this movie. I am not sure what the supporters are watching to like this even a bit. The acting is terrible. Angelina Jolie is a joke, Anthony Hopkins becomes annoying, Colin Farrell just makes you shake your head, and Val Kilmer is laughable. The directing is ridiculous.

","I give it a star for the Battle of Gaugamela and a star for the scenery. The rest of the movie sucked. I couldn't believe how slow it was. Just about nothing happened from Gaugamela to the end. It was incredibly long and as boring as anything could be. The fake accent by Angelina Jolie was appalling and stupid as heck. The worst part of the movie were the narrations by Anthony Hopkins. He explained all the parts of the movie that were too hard to act out on screen, because Oliver Stone wanted to fill up most of the movie with mindless disputes between Alexander and his men. I mean, the whole point of a movie is that you are told the story visually. But in this movie, you see a bunch of guys riding around on horses as Hopkins explains what is happening.<br/><br/>A little inaccuracy that just about made me gag from idiocy was in the last battle when that guy gets impaled on the elephant's tusk. Come on! Like that would ever happen. You know how dull those are. That part ruined any emotion I would have felt during the last battle.<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!"
"jenkingsbill","3","3","4","22 June 2005"," Wrong Emphasis on a Legendary Person
","When doing a biographical movie of a person, writers and directors need to emphasis the right parts of the person. They both need to show what made the person great in comparison to who they were as a person. A careful balance is needed between the legend and the person. And Alexander fails this test miserably. With only a few battles and a vague showing of Alexander's diplomatic abilities, this movie primarily focuses on who Alexander was as a person and his style of life. And although this is important, it was overplayed and greatly overshadowed what made Alexander Alexander the Great. And, while it is important to point out, and actually emphasise that Alexander was bi-sexual if not gay, it is even more important to show that Alexander was first a conqueror and second a human. Because when talking about Alexander the Great, he is larger than life, a character that is infinitely rare. Other problems with the movie was the battle in the forest in which Alexander is wounded and the artistic value of contrasting the colors with a shift failed to do whatever it was meant to do. The end of the movie dragged on, making the last 30 minutes seem almost painful. While historically accurate, which it most likely is, the movie fails to show Alexander the Great and ultimately fails do to the one thing a movie is supposed to do, entertain."
"james_stabwest","5","3","4","30 April 2005"," Had potential, but ultimately a big disappointment
","When a film has Oliver Stone's name attached to it is released, you think of Platoon, Wall Street, Born on the 4th of July, JFK, all great films. So considering the hype that preceded Alexander you'd expect it to be a great epic film in the same category as Braveheart, or Gladiator. Unfortunately despite the strong cast, they ended up giving poor performances, seeming wooden and unnatural (with 2 exceptions). I'm no big Colin Farrel fan, but I must say his performance was the one thing that kept me going through this very long (too long) film. As well as Val Kilmer in the first quarter of the film (one of his best performances). <br/><br/>The big disappointments are from Angelina Jolie who seemed to be trying too hard to achieve a character which was flawed to begin with. The dialogue coming from her seemed like something from a fantasy novel, not a historical epic. And what was with that phony accent?<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins must have given one of the most boring performances of his career. I must say I was on the verge of falling asleep at the end of the film wondering when he would just shut up(Poor Anthony how did he get himself mixed up in this debacle).<br/><br/>Jared Leto's character was just pathetic, he seemed to have no backbone at all, its no wonder he didn't die in the first battle in the film. Most of the film just featured him standing around with a smirk on his face and he hardly had any dialogue. His death scene was horrendous. <br/><br/>Overall at the end of this drawn out film I felt as if I had wasted my time and money. Don't waste yours."
"rogerdarlington","Null","3","4","16 January 2005"," Could sink like a Stone
","I had awaited this movie eagerly: the story of a man who conquered most of the known world by the time he was 25 is truly epic; I have recently read one of the many new biographies of the Macedonian warrior; in his time, director Oliver Stone has produced some fine work; and here he has spent no less than $150M, making it Europe's most costly film. One could not fail to be aware of the panning given the work by the critics, but I figured that it really couldn't be that bad. But, believe me, it is. ""Gladiator"" showed what an epic should look like and ""Troy"" was a good effort, but Stone - who, at his best, has given us such impressive work as ""Salvador"", ""Platoon"" and ""Wall Street"" - will be fortunate to survive this plodding and pedestrian debacle. The first hour is utterly tedious and one cries out for the sort of battle sequence which opened ""Gladiator"" while, towards, the sprawling end, we seem to be revisiting the manic ending of ""Apocalyse Now"" without Brando's style.<br/><br/>So, when did it go wrong? Well, seemingly at every stage of the production process. First, Stone - and his producer Moritz Borman - rushed the whole thing in order to beat a rival production (now unlikely to reach the screen) planned by Australian director Baz Luhrmann. Then the script - co-authored by Stone himself - overdoes the theme of Alexander's bi-sexuality which is death at the US box office and becomes somewhat histrionic for the rest of the world. Some of the casting is odd - most notably the choice of Angelina Jolie (only one year older than Colin Farrell in the eponymous role) to play Alexander's mother. Next we have the appalling decision to have most of the lead actors deploy incongruous Irish accents just because lead Colin Farrell (who can do other accents) hails from the emerald isle. The whole structure is a disaster with a boring, and largely redundant, narration, confusing flashbacks, and a total bum-numbing, mind-bending length of just under three hours. Finally the editing is all wrong, as Stone made three major cuts to slice away close to an hour, but slashed too little and disjointedly. The essence of cinema is storytelling and this work utterly lacks a compelling narrative which, given the heroic feats and complex character of the man, is a special kind of achievement.<br/><br/>Surely the film has some redeeming features? Well, the two battle sequences - the defeat of Darius and his superior forces at Gaugamela and the encounter with Indians and elephants at Hydaspes in India - are genuinely large-scale and exciting, although it is difficult to follow Alexander's tactics. The Moroccan and Thailand locations are exotic, the richly-designed sets are grand and the CGI creations, especially of the glory of Babylon, are well done. The attention to historic and military detail is commendable and thanks to Oxford academic Robin Lane Fox who gets to lead the battle charges as a reward. Angelina Jolie has the best accent (not Irish) and gives the best performance. But this is far from enough to justify the price of a theatre ticket. Can the work be rescued for the DVD or is it destined to sink like Stone? Often the DVD offers us a longer version of the movie, but this time we need a shorter, reordered account with a linear narrative, less talk and much more action."

","Oh dear. You know I really enjoy Oliver Stone's work, even when he's missing the target, like in the gloriously ludicrous 'Doors' movie, but I never expected to find myself staring at my watch and thinking 'get on with it'.<br/><br/>The warning signs are there right from the beginning. Anthony Hopkins, playing an ancient king of Egypt who had once served under Alexandera, recounts his experiences. It isn't too long before his memoirs, instead of engaging the audience, take on the tone of a boring classics teacher. <br/><br/>Maybe it was Stone's belligerence in trying to make a historically accurate film that scuppered it. Maybe he worked too closely with the Academics. By not taking liberties with the truth he has made a film too confusing and complicated to follow, even with King Ptolemy's - that was Hopkins' character - droning narrative. Not being an expert on this period of history, I hadn't got a clue who most of the people were, where they had come from and where they were going. The films' attempts to cover the more political, social, religious and economic aspects of the time meant over-long rambling scenes that just didn't work.<br/><br/>Once you've committed the fatal  movie  sin of not letting your audience emphasise with the characters, it's downhill from then on. And, of course, once you loose interest you start looking for other things to entertain you.<br/><br/>Let's start, and how can you not, with the amazing Angelina Jolie. Not content with chewing up the whole set she has decided to play the part with Ingrid Pitt's accent from Countess Dracula. If she'd have been appearing in a typical sword and sandals epic she would have been wonderful. In a pious effort like this, however, the other cast members (and the audience as well) all shuffle nervously away from her in an attempt to put as much distance between themselves and her as possible. And as for those poor snakes <br/><br/>And then there is the hair. I'm pretty sure Colin Farrell wears that permanent vexed expression throughout the film to convey the immense pressures of leadership, but it could also quite easily be caused by the thought of the current wig he has upon his head.<br/><br/>And then there's the bisexual issue. I would have a lot more time for Oliver Stone's protest about a homophobic backlash in the States, if the film's handling of Alexander sex life wasn't so fey itself. He has no problem with showing the brutality and savagery of battle, so why couldn't he have carried this on with Alexander's relationships. Instead we have Colin Farrell and Jared Leto staring mistily into each others eyes like some star-crossed lovers in a Mills and Boom novel. Surely the whole point about these pre-Christian times was that homosexuality was not equated as some limp-wristed weakness, that's very much a modern idiom. If anything it was the opposite, a re-enforcement of their masculinity.<br/><br/>Enough. This isn't even a flawed masterpiece, it's basically dull. Any redeeming features are few and far between. Yet I do hope it's not too disastrous a financial failure. I recently read a review of this film in which the critic said that he always eagerly awaits a new Olive Stone movie and is always disappointed. I totally agree with that, but this is a big disappointment.<br/><br/>All I can suggest to Mr Stone is to have a big roar  like Alexander's during his only sex scene, well 'Meow' more like  and move on. We'll all be waiting."
"el_monty_BCN","4","3","4","13 January 2005"," It may be as historically accurate as you want, but it's just plain boring
","It seems, as many reviewers in this section rave about, this film is surprisingly historically accurate for what we are used to in Hollywood epics (although not enough for some!). In that respect it is quite didactic, and I thank Oliver Stone for informing me about the life of a very relevant historical figure who, I admit, I didn't know well enough. But taken as a movie, and not a history lesson, I'm sorry guys, but it is boring as hell. And, before you start, I'm not yearning for less ""talky"" scenes and more battle scenes. In fact, I found that even the few battle scenes (specially the second battle) became a bit boring in the end. I don't mind large amounts of dialog in a film, in fact I enjoy it (my favourite movie of 2004 was Before Sunset, which is nothing but a dialog), AS LONG AS IT IS INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO! And that's the problem here: much of what is said is just not interesting, because it is too convoluted, or too obvious, or too irrelevant, or too repetitive, or too arid, or too obscure, or too adorned, or just doesn't make any sense. And when you have to listen to this kind of dialog for three hours, you just get bored. Stone has fallen into the same trap as in Nixon: he doesn't know when to stop, when to cut, when to just hint instead of giving you speech after speech. In the end, his biopics become farragos, too arduous to follow. I prefer his lighter films, like U-turn, which may be less profound, but much, much more entertaining."
"TheNorthernMonkee","3","3","4","6 January 2005"," chaotic mess with only Jolie lead
","SPOILERS In recent years there has been an increasing trend in Hollywood to produce major Epics about historical events. Every director has his own little time era or story which he likes to explore. After Wolfgang Peterson's adaptation of ""Troy"" last year, it is not hard to see why some began to question this devotion to the genre. Now, after Oliver Stone put considerable amounts of work into ""Alexander"", the genre must surely be all but buried. This film, led by an atrocious performance by Colin Farrell, is a chaotic mess which feels longer than the entire ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy put together.<br/><br/>In ancient Macedonia, drunken King Philip (Val Kilmer) and his snake obsessed wife Olympias (Angelina Jolie) have a son, Alexander (Farrell). As Alexander slowly grows up, he and his friends learn about the known world, and develop as individuals. Eventually becoming King, Alexander will lead an army of Macedonians from one side of the known world to the other.<br/><br/>From the offset, questions must be raised about the creation of this film. With Anthony Hopkins as an old Ptolemy, we learn about the basics of the story, so as to lead us into Alexander's life. Hopkins will reoccur throughout the film, and unlike most of the cast, Hopkins is in trouble because he acts too well. Playing an old and feeble man, Hopkins looses cohesion and organised thought, countless times. So much so that if he was around in the modern day, he'd probably have been put in an old folks home years ago.<br/><br/>Once the story of Alexander himself actually begins to happen, events continue to progress at a crawl. From one encounter with his drunken father (Kilmer actually putting in a decent performance) to another, the boy grows up split between his parents. His mother is played by Angelina Jolie and to be completely honest, Jolie is perhaps the one highlight of the film. Looking as beautiful as ever, Jolie ranges from decent acting through to excessive over the top stages. Never the less, when she is on screen, she delights with her strange Transylvanian accent.<br/><br/>Parents aside, the problem for the young Alexander is the fact that he will eventually turn into Colin Farrell. Whilst normally a tolerable actor, in this film Farrell is absolutely hideous as the homosexual Alexander with an Irish accent. The accent is so strong in fact, that when young Alexander appears on the screen, you find yourself wetting yourself at how ridiculously Irish he is. Other actors suffer too as throughout the film, it appears that rather than simply giving Farrell voice lessons, it was easier to simply get huge numbers of the cast to speak as if they're from Dublin.<br/><br/>Crucially the main problem with ""Alexander"" is just how incoherent it is. From battle scenes which are impossible to follow, through to scenes of madness which are never fully resolved, the story suffers from bad direction and bad writing. Oliver Stone is normally wonderful at his job. With films like ""Nixon"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Natural Born Killers"", Stone has proved that he can write, direct and produce films which hold together and entertain. it is amazing therefore that ""Alexander"", an amazing labour of love for Stone, is such an abomination.<br/><br/>When Farrell was first being touted as Alexander, there were actually two films about the figure being touted. With Stone making a film, fellow director Baz Luhrmann was also considering making the film, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of Alexander. Whether this other film will ever be made now is unknown, but hope springs eternal. Whilst few could compare to Jolie's performance (Nicole Kidman originally being touted), in the hands of Luhrmann and DiCaprio, the story and lead character could be significantly better than the turgid mess which is now available. ""Alexander"" was being put forward as something special. Well in that respect it is true. The film is certainly special, but not in a good way. Avoid."
"scazza","1","3","4","5 January 2005"," Forget morality, Stone should have hired an editor!
","I like Oliver Stone and I thought this would be a ruthless psychological portrayed like his other political films. Oh no.<br/><br/>1. The film is basically raw footage. Long speeches with no arc, repeating themselves in the mouths of different characters. it is torture. There are good moments there, almost many different movies. A good editor could make this into a good movie.<br/><br/>2. Unearned sentimentality. There are no risks, no justification for the complete and utter melodrama that is up on screen. We don't follow or understand the emotion. We don't know why Alex hates his mother, we don't know why certain emotions are even expressed within a certain scene. If this was edited down to focus on one emotional arc, it would help the movie a great deal.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of potential and great promotional material. Unfortunately it went the way of the movie Troy."
"latherzap","3","3","4","4 January 2005"," Ouch
","I don't care if some of the accents were off. I don't care if Jolie may have been too young for her role. I don't even care whether or not Stone is 100% faithful to history. But you must hold my interest. Even a terrible Ed Wood type movie can be interesting in its badness. But Alexander is not even memorable in that category. And, no, homosexuality does not bother me. Sorry to disappoint you- I realize that screeching about people's prejudices can sometimes be a nice way to indirectly pat yourself on the back. But I'm afraid you won't have that opportunity, here.<br/><br/>Cheesy dialogue. The ""controversial"" sexuality basically consisted of Leto and Farrell surreptitiously glancing at one another. The sexuality was not explored at all. Overblown battle scenes which drag on forever. The battles feel like you're just watching hundreds of random people riding horses and slashing at one another, with no great sense of who's winning or what progress is being made. To me the fight scenes are no more elevated than a big budget American Gladiators, with a hokey bird flying overhead. Battle. Rousing speech to build troops' morale. Battle. Wash, rinse, repeat cycle. Haven't we seen this stuff before? The scenes felt stapled together. Reading a Cliffs Notes synopsis of Alexander's story would have given me more emotional impact than this movie.<br/><br/>Now and then characters manage to spit out something mildly interesting. Alexander at one point angrily and humbly asks about the conquered people ""And what makes us better than them?"". Another reviewer here seemed impressed that Alexander at one point asks ""am I divine, or weak?"". Hmmm.Hardly profound. On second thought maybe there wasn't any good dialogue. I can appreciate that a lot of time and money and hard work was put into this movie, but it just didn't do it for me. If you want a decent Oliver Stone movie, I think you should check out Talk Radio instead.<br/><br/>And I've noticed a few pompous folks from other countries snorting that Alexander is too smart for Americans. I'll be the first to agree that most American movies are terrible. But when taking a multiple choice test, even a fool will sometimes pick the right answer. And I think that's just what the American public did in this case. This movie will NOT be remembered."
"aroider","2","3","4","3 January 2005"," There is Nothing Great about this Alexander!!!
","I have never actually written a review about a film in this site as I don't really believe in Film Criticism. It's all a very subjective matter. However, after watching Alexander I felt compelled to do so. Alexander the Great is one of the Greatest Historical figures, he is not a myth, not a Hollywood hero. The portrayal of his character and his amazing achievements demand not only respect, but a profound knowledge and understanding of his persona and the historical context of that period. I was devastated when I saw this Alexander because there is really nothing great about him. I cannot even say the words, ""It doesn't make justice to Alexander the Great"". Colin Farrell played the role of a warrior who was brave in battle, weak emotionally, not really beautiful, not very gifted as a leader, not to mention a king... with a mother who spend more time with her snakes than with her own people and a father who behaved like a drunk viking. His poor horse was short legged and looked inferior to the Arabian horses in the battles and all his generals spoke English with a different accent and who all in all were only interested in slicing flesh and getting drunk in orgies. So it is mentioned that he founded a few Alexandrias here and there and that he reached the ends of the world where people fought on four legged giants called elephants. Well, so what? If this were really the life and work of Alexander the Great I am convinced that he wouldn't have been called Great and he wouldn't have marked the world history the way that he did. Alexander the Great was so great because he was truly gifted. He got the best education, he was taught how to respect all knowledge, how to love the human and the divine. His intellect and spirituality together with insightful and progressive way of thinking made him so wise for his age and so successful. The aura that surrounded his persona was magical and intoxicating. So many thousands of warriors, Greeks and ""savages"" followed Alexander to the ends of the world because they admired and respected him, because they believed in his vision and because they loved him like a God not because he was their king, but because of who he was.<br/><br/>The cultural Heritage that Alexander the Great left behind for all civilizations to come is immense and cannot be counted by the battles he won, or portrayed in a three hour film. However, it is sad that with a subject so rich, so Great that what we see on the screen is so poor, so superficial and so commercialized! This Alexander is an insult to one of the Greatest kings history has ever had! I am sorry, but Mr. Stone, you could have done at least a little bit better!"

"dhaufrect-1","1","3","4","5 December 2004"," An Epic Bore
","""Alexander"" is truly an epic bore with little if any redeeming qualities. In fact, it's worst quality is the extreme length. This film lasts a tortuous 3 hours and 20 minutes. One can count the minutes, thus Oliver Stone should be ashamed to have splashed this disaster on the silver screen.<br/><br/>There is such a waste of great actors. Anthony Hopkins is abused by his role as narrator. Christopher Plummer is wasted as Aristotle. Val Kilmer plays Phillip, Alexander's father. They all give an adequate performance, but there was so little to work with because of the weak production. The scenery is spectacular, but so is the failure of this epic drama. Perhaps the ""R"" rating will keep some folks away from the theater. I fear, however, that it will be used to simply attract the unsuspecting moviegoer. This would be a great one to miss. Staying to the end is a major challenge."
"fmissel","3","3","4","5 December 2004"," A huge disappointment, as battle and historic movies goes
","I can hardly understand how it could go wrong with the movie considering the director and theme, but it was a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>Firstly, the movie shows few scenes from the childhood and young age. There is a few shots of an insecure looking boy. But they do not build up the character so that it is believable. They seem like disconnected scenes. You don't really get to understand this person, what motivates him. It is narrated, but it does not seem real - you don't feel for the character or understand him. Still there is some drama in the beginning and you hope it can turn out a good movie.<br/><br/>But then there is suddenly a jump in the story line after these few scenes. Anthony Hopkins rambles on about what happened between the boy and his father, and then you are suddenly immersed into a battle situation. You follow discussions between Alexander and some of his generals or aides. Also, you see him talking to the soldiers before the battle. But again it does not come over as real. It seems like scenes acted out by amateurish actors. I will say that it simply does not seem like the actors believe in the story, including Collin Farrell. <br/><br/>The above is in sharp contrast to great battle movies like Braveheart and Troy which delivers the merchandize with believable heroes, brilliant acting and fascinating plots. Alexander is the total opposite. Whereas Anthony Hopkins narration makes us anticipate the portray of a charismatic leader of men - almost like a god to use his own words - the actual scenes makes Alexander seem weak, indecisive, confused and over indulgent. Why does the movie focus on so many of his faults, so much so, that the greatness of the man disappears?<br/><br/>Now, Oliver Stone may think that he is historically very correct, wanting to give the movie a documentary dimension. From my history lessons I had the expectation of a great leader with drive. This movie portrays him as too insecure and confused in many situations, and as a lunatic in some of the battle situations. Despite what psychological problems the real Alexander might have had due to his upbringing and tense relationship with his mother, I do believe that he must have been much more determined and strong than that weakling from shown in the movie. Otherwise he could not have attained as much.<br/><br/>As for the battle scenes, I found many of them claustrophobic and confusing with too many close ups. There is also too much blood and gore, which can be okay but only when it supports a good and believable plot. In this movie it just seems confusing and like it has been put into the movie just to have it there. The battle situations seems somehow disconnected from the main movie, like they are something added because they are expected to be there. You don't really get any feeling for each characters achievement in these battles which would have helped to build them up as believable.<br/><br/>In general I would say that there too much focus on jamming as many scenes and events into the movie as possible, with the effect of chopping up the plot and having characters that one does not get to really know, the result being that you cannot really identify with them or feel connected to the story.<br/><br/>Of good things in the movie I can mention are Angelina Jolie as the mother of Alexander. She is very convincing with her disturbed, dark personality and intrigues. But hers was a minor role. Also, some of the filming and visual effects were very nicely done. But these things cannot save the movie. <br/><br/>I am so very irritated with this long movie. It was a waste of time and I felt like leaving several times. I have rated it 3."

","I was highly disappointed in this movie. Mr. Stone missed an opportunity to educate people on the greatest military genius of all time, and instead turned Alexander the Great into a weeping housewife of a sissy. Lets face it, we all know Greeks were bisexual, but devoting three hours to it is unnecessary and redundant. Mention it and get on with the war campaigning. Don't make it the focal point of the movie. No matter what your sexual preference, religious denomination or personal thoughts on the matter, watching three hours of people make eyes at each other and crying every scene is enough to make you sick. Mind numbing, butt numbing, historically inaccurate, and ripped off Troy in many different scenes. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even as a rental. Absolutely historically inaccurate, and has nothing to do with Alexander's military prowess. A total piece of trash."
"ikullolli","1","3","4","30 November 2004"," What went wrong!?
","It is not surprising that filmmakers or even historians cannot capture the whole picture of Alexander the Great. <br/><br/>First of all, his mother was from an Illyrian (Albanian) tribe. The original name of Macedonia was ""Emathia,"" which in Albanian means ""the great land,"" hence the appellation Alexander the Great. (The same was true with Constantine the Great and Justinian the Great, all from the general area of Macedonia. Sometimes the area was more inclusive during the Roman times).<br/><br/>To capture Alexander the Great as a soldier, one need only look to the successive generations of Illyrians to witness their exploits. The Albanians literally took over the Ottoman Empire with the Kuprili family -- of obscure origin from Albania. <br/><br/>More than 70% of Alexander's army was Illyrian (Albanian). He didn't rely on other armies as much as he did on the Illyrian one! This is totally missing in the film (except for one dying soldier who said he was from Illyria).<br/><br/>It would be a remarkable accomplishment to put to film and book alike in a more truthful light. Audiences would really come to know the fact and not the fiction. And probably next time ""Alexander The Great"" movie will beat ""SpungeBob"" in theaters!"

","Alexander the Movie though not bad failed to impress me. Collin Farrel does not portray Alexander as a unflinching brilliant warrior who is raised from childhood to battle, but rather a young unexperienced man conquering the world partly because he is running away from something. The movie is not historically accurate and skips major points in his life. The camera in battle never gives you a sense of the awe of the battles and the amount of men involved. It seems they focused more on the drama rather then the battles. however the costume designs are quite impressive especially for the Persians. in general a descent movie but nothing compared to Braveheart or Gladiator. I don't think this movie shows the real man Alexander was. you don't leave the theater wanting to be him, wanting to go kick some butt, and thats what we all want(at least i do). his movie should be as spectacular as him its only deserving.

The same inaccessible quality that made him so hot in *My So-Called Life* makes him wooden here, and in his best scenes he's only a lukewarm admirer. Farrell consistently gives more, and the result is an uneven sort-of relationship that, worse, is scripted as some grand passion.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Subpoint: The film is selling Alexander as preferring boys to girls, but, despite its men-in-skirts fetish, it spends much more sexual energy on Roxane than on either of Alexander's boys. It tiptoes past several same-sex kiss possibilities, one in particular, and reduces the same-sex affairs to a look or a come-hither gesture. In contrast, it gives us Roxane, totally, bouncingly naked, slapping Alexander in vigorous foreplay. Other scenes suggest the nature of the same-sex relationships -- the ""orgy"" scene and the Babylonian dancer come to mind -- but nothing connects this to Alexander. Is this a want of courage on Stone's part? Or Farrell's? Was the relationship with Leto merely what the 19th c. would have called an Ardent Friendship? What's the deal? I left the film unsure whether A. and H. were involved sexually at all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some battle scenes seem meant to induce seizure. The close-ups are cut fast, and the camera jets around dizzyingly. One shot shows a significant look on Alexander's face, just for a second, but I couldn't figure out what it meant. (Doesn't help that, as other reviewers have said, many characters are all but indistinguishable.) And there's gore everywhere; this is great for effect but turns some parts into really bewildering bloodbaths.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Toward the end, the film goes reeeeeeally self-indulgent -- big danger zone for this director. You think it ends, but then it begins something totally new, and though the new thing is worth exploring, one doesn't have the stamina. Stone seems so eager to make Alexander an epic figure that he avoids moments of humanity throughout -- those little smiling or stumbling moments that make a character believable. (Jolie is the worst for this, though it's the way her part's written; Kilmer helps a lot, but his Philip doesn't cohere.) The actual ending couldn't be more in love with itself if it starred Kevin Costner.</li></ul><br/><br/>etc.<br/><br/>We need a new rule for directors: make a two-hour movie straight up, or make a four-hour movie with a built-in intermission.

It wasn't that it was just bad acting, but the costumes looked bad and the sets look even worse. I thought Anthony Hopkins performed well and so did Angelina Jolie, but that was it. I don't usually post on this website, but I wouldn't recommend anyone seeing this movie. Someone else should of directed it or something.

"kinmuan","1","3","4","26 November 2004"," Terrible, all around
","Forget all the media hype you're hearing about this movie because of its gay/bisexual tones. That's not the reason this is a terrible movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is terrible. Colin Farrell's performance is horrible. Anthony Hopkins is good, but has very little on screen time. Val Kilmer probably had the best acting, for the amount of on screen time. Angelina Jolie wasn't too bad either. But Farrell, and the rest of his supporting cast is terrible. Why are they using English, British and Irish accents? To distinguish between the people? Good grief, these actors get payed millions of dollars, they should either fake it, or all speak in the same accent.<br/><br/>The war scenes are pathetic. First of all, there are TWO, count em, TWO fight scenes in this movie. They are poorly shot. A shaky camera that switches between shots of people being stabbed. There is great strategy in the fights, but you never get a feel for it, with the way it's shot. The desert seen has *way* too much dust. And you rarely see 1on1 fights, its more of a *cut to Farrell on his horse* *cut to someone being stabbed* *back to Farrell*. You never get to see any real fighting. And if you watch on the overhead shots, you can tell the actors in the surrounding armies aren't really trying, and don't have any energy for the fight.<br/><br/>Back to the acting. There's an overly-dramatic scream every 20minutes. IT LOSES ITS MEANING. All the scenes that should be dramatic, and Farrell's speech scenes that are supposed to be inspiring all fall flat, and feel over dramatized. The movie is terrible, nevermind any historical or mythological inaccuracies. They glazed over too many details as well, just dismissed large battles. In fact, you never see any fights that involve him conquering Persia. You see him fighting against the man responsible for the King's death, and his expansion in India.<br/><br/>I'm going to go shove hot pokers through my eyes, and hope I can erase the memories from my brain."

Don't get me wrong, Oliver Stone has one of my favorite directors for years, but I don't know exactly what he was trying to accomplish here. No message of the movie was given; Alexander made no sense, he gave no true basis of his reason to keep on conquering ahead.

"Scifanime","5","3","4","25 November 2004"," It's so out of focus, you don't remember he's great until you're told!
","This film is flawed from start to finish, though it has admirable moments. The images that are flashed before you are often beautiful, but you are rarely afforded a meaning behind them. Alexander is rich with emotions, but as an audience member you don't experience any of them, and are almost unsure why the actors are feeling them...<br/><br/>The main thing that this film lacks is any sense of direction, and a clear picture at what we are to be expecting when it gets to its destination. Scenes are thrown together is seemingly random order, though the general movement of scenes is in chronological order. When jumping from scene to scene the viewer begins to wonder just what purpose that scene will play in the larger picture, and in most cases the answer is none. It seems as if the battles displayed in the film were picked merely because of Oliver Stone's desire to shoot them, though the battle for Persia was quite possibly the most important victory in Alexander's campaign. Of course the film fails miserably in stressing that fact to the audience. Several long and arduous scenes seem to have no reason at all for being there. It is not that they wouldn't play well to showing the effects of Alexander's actions on his popularity amongst the world, it's that fact that Oliver Stone fails to display these effects at all throughout the movie. We are told that Alexander is more or less loved by our ever active narrator, though we are never shown it. <br/><br/>Maybe the worst flaw of the entire movie is the disproportional focus of the picture. We are shown countless numbers of scenes in which Alexander reveals his dependence on, and love for Hephaistion. Not only do these scenes become more and more uncomfortable as time goes on, they do nothing to further the story. We simply see nearly identical dialogue played out while the characters embrace, and we are once again 'introduced' to the idea that Alexander was likely a bisexual. In fact, this ever boring tale of ""I love you. I still love you. If you died I couldn't go on. You've died, I can't go on!"" takes center stage over Alexander as a person and over Alexander's achievements. <br/><br/>In the final moments of the film Anthony Hopkins, our beloved narrator, tells us in finality that Alexander truly was great; a god amongst men in fact. It is in that moment that you realize that after three hours of film, you're pretty much going to have to take his word for it. Even at that point, you would assume that if the message of the entire film had been lost in a muddled mess of an ever unchanging tale of male companionship, that you would have at least had an interest in it. Truthfully, the viewer is never given any reason to care about what happens to Hephaistion at all. His character is almost used exclusively as a vehicle for displaying the homosexual nature of Alexander.<br/><br/>Overall, the film ended up being the failed vision of a director who clearly put a lot into the film. The unfortunateness of the whole affair is that the viewer never really gets anything out of the experience."

But after that, I spent a full two hours wishing this dude would just croak. This film was shot in only a year, and they seem to have left out the last month of editing. Many, many brushes around the gay theory, much screaming and arm-waving, but they kind of missed Egypt, Syria, the entire geopolitics of 332 BC. The first time Alex gets his guys cheering and thinking he's great in the whole second half of the movie is when he decides they can quit and go home. He's unlikable, but in a way that made me keep saying ""so what?"" If the story has a moral, it's ""never attack an elephant on foot."" Way, way too long for the points it makes, way too artifically dramatic, and I'd love to know how they figured out what kind of accent everyone should have--Angelina Jolie sounds like Natasha in Rocky and Bullwinkle."

Overall a waste of THREE hours of my life. I realize that back in the day the Greeks did have relations with both boys and girls, but honestly if you train your boys to wrestle each other in their underwear, what do they think is going to happen.

The movie itself does not even now what it is trying to say about Alexander's life. There are a handful of gorgeous shots but the rest of the movie is pretty much gaytacular. Stone had numerous shots that instead of being serious were just uncomfortably funny. The movies dialogue is so benal and superfluous (this is a feat in itself). The movie does a fantastic job at making the audience feel absolutely nothing for any of these characters. When they die the only sympathy you will feel is for yourself because you have now sat through nearly three hours of the most boring show of the year."

","... and I'd never been proved wrong, until now. The script/dialogue, casting, accents, character ""development"", selection and development of themes, plot and tome of this movie are an utter mess. <br/><br/>I hold no previously established distaste for Stone or any of the actors, and I'd read no reviews going in. I enjoy challenging movies, and I promise any other reviewer who claims my dislike comes from an unwillingness to think is wrong. My distaste for this movie comes from the sheer horror I experience when I realize millions of people are about to be tricked into seeing this atrocious film. <br/><br/>If Alexander had been the person Stone portrays him to be, he would never have accomplished all he did. I am not referring to the fact that, as a Macedonian living circa 350BC, he probably had carnal knowledge of a few men, and that the movie works with this probability. That's just fine. Ferrell was the wrong decision for this part, and the script never lets him have a backbone, much less the god-like drive that historians credit Alexander with. <br/><br/>Jolie's accent is odd, (I know a number of Greeks and Russians. Her accent resembles the latter.) but at least she stays with it. Ferrell pops out a brogue every now and again. The shaky character development is further highlighted by this breaking of illusion. The pervasive inclusion of modern-day American clichés in the dialogue further shatters the illusion. <br/><br/>Stone's choices about what pieces of history make the cut are odd. This fact, coupled with cheesy soundwork, bad, negligible and tangled character development and a seemingly anesthetized Jared Leto with too damn much eyeliner made me empathize with the soldier's sentiment near the end of this three-plus hour movie. I was completely worn out by Alexander."

","Forget the trumped-up controversy over subject matter that has already taken up way too much time and energy during the past political season in the USA, and focus on what the film accomplishes. On a mere technical level, it is superior in every way to ""Troy,"" ""Gladiator,"" and (ugh) ""Braveheart."" The scenic majesty and coarse brutality of life in multiple ancient civilizations is presented in a dazzling and sweeping style; say what you will about his limitations as a writer of dialogue, Oliver Stone is a consummate artist with his command of the camera. The epic battle scenes are heart-pounding and thrilling. The opulent recreation of Babylon is one of the reasons movies exist on the big screen. And the outsize-emotions expressed by these flesh and blood characters is fitting , given their the historical significance; credit the actors for breathing passion and sincerity into some of the clearly unsubtle exchanges of dialogue, which we tend to view from a post-Freudian viewpoint that has some merit but seems beside the point in light of the fact that these archetypes might well have been models for Freudian analysis. And now--okay--the Love that Dares to Speak Its Name: (1) get over it everybody and (2) hooray for Oliver Stone's willingness to present HIS take on things sexual, sensual and emotional. I, for one, admire his insistence on including the immutable emotional bond between Alexander and his beloved Hephaestion, and the scene in which they stand together, gazing out over the splendor of a moonlit Babylon which now belongs to them, while freely and openly speaking of their LOVE, is a beautiful thing indeed. I might WANT to see them making love (who wouldn't want to see these two beautiful men naked together?) but it is not at all necessary and, say what you will, the scene in which Hephaestion gives Alexander a ring on his wedding night and wishes him a son, it's brave and bold work for all involved. A Puritanical and hypocritical Red State Dominated USA simply cannot cope; I say, more, more, more, and thank you Oliver Stone for what you have wrought! The lead and supporting performances offer all of the spice, intrigue, passion and danger required from these characters, and Colin Farrell truly proves himself to be worthy of his character and an ever-icreasing importance in the industry. I doubt that it will receive Academy Award nominations in major categories, but it should do conspicuously well in technical categories, as befits its outstanding production values. Let's hope the DVD includes another hour or two of footage and lots of commentary about the making and marketing of this gigantic effort. Fortune favors the bold, and Oliver Stone is the boldest of all major American filmmakers, including the brilliant Scorsese."
"ptolemesoter","1","4","6","14 March 2012"," so so so bad!
","To be candid, after having watched Alexander, I had to run and watch Platoon again - one of my all-time favorites - to restore my respect to Mr.Stone. What was that?!! I'm trying hard to keep my negative view reasonably negative, but, afraid, nothing seems too critical when talking of THIS Alexander.<br/><br/>Analysis of the numerous factual inaccuracies may take hours. Well, OK, if Mr Stone indeed aimed to turn the Alexander's ages into a light-weight entertainment for us - that's his right. But there are details I'd expected he'd really pay attention to, at least for sake of perfectionism. Unfortunately they've been completely disregarded.<br/><br/>1.You don't need to be a scholar to regard Alexander as one of the most genius personalities in the mankind's history - as a leader, general, king, politician, or diplomat. Instead, we saw a fragile, quasi-incestuous, bisexual chap, hysterical, shedding tears left and right, and occasionally stating pseudo-philosophic and futuristic phrases about democracy, liberalism, equality and freedom - something that could never be in the agenda of an ambitious conqueror of the ancient times. What, are we being thus assured that the good guys 2400 years ago had the same values as we have today?<br/><br/>2. Macedonia was not the same as Greece, nor was it a province of Greece. In fact, Greece was invaded, knelt and silenced by the Macedons prior to the campaign against Persia. Thus, no way Alexander would be inspirng his men before the decisive battle with slogans ""and to the glory of Greece!"". Of the same nature - the Latin word 'empire' came into existence centuries after Alexander. Was Persia purportedly called Empire to remind us that imperialists are villains in the movie? <br/><br/>3. One of the main features of Alexander was his superhuman aura, intellectual power,dominance, that literally suppressed even his closest surrounding. So,why do we see Alexander's relationships with his subjects the way more appropriate to the gang of cowboys chanting ""he's a jolly good fellow!"" to their buddy? Was it to make us think of him that he's just ""one of us"", only a bit more successful? <br/><br/>4. Who wouldn't know that women of those times were grown in an environment of speechless respect and even fear to the men as such, let alone their own husbands. Especially among the ancient Asian peoples. And it was simply ridiculous to see that Alexander's newly wed wife Roxana,who was only 15 then, is furiously slapping the face of her semi-divine husband, as if she'd been professionally practicing S/M in her tiny village before Alexander's arrival... What was that for? <br/><br/>5. During the main battle scene, when Parmenion dispatches his son Philotas to ask Alexander for help, with the words ""and if he wouldn't listen - kill him for the treason!"". Hey,people, king and treason? How can this possibly be? No comments...<br/><br/>Put together, this is not a movie about the truly great leader and his circle of wise and brave courtiers, who actually launched the whole new twist in Europe's, Asia's and Africa's histories, introduced Hellenistic culture, and shaped the future of many powerful kingdoms for centuries ahead. Instead, we see the story of a band of poorly equipped men, with remarkable homo and bi-sexual inclinations, headed to somewhere in search of something and fighting with somebody.<br/><br/>In result - we got cheap unrealistic show instead of potentially epic historical movie. My subjective recommendation - watch, if there's nothing to see elsewhere."

"gordansaltirov","1","4","6","20 September 2011"," Very bad film from historical and national point ...
","As you are all aware, Oliver Stone's film on the Macedonian conqueror Alexander is due to open on November 24. We, the Macedonians, the descendents of Alexander's Macedonians, want to inform you that we reject the movie as historically inaccurate for it is not a true story of Alexander as Stone claims it to be. We are particularly concerned by the ""Greekness"" that Stone has given to the Macedonian king.<br/><br/>1) Where are the Historical Errors in the film?<br/><br/>Stone has Collin Farell (the actor playing Alexander) saying to the Macedonians before the battle of Gaugamela against the Persians that they are fighting for ""the glory of Greece."" <br/><br/>Ancient sources do not write that Alexander fought for the ""glory of Greece"" but for that of Macedonia. Three ancient historians detailed Alexander's address to the army before the battle. And each one of them made a clear distinction between Macedonians, Greeks, Illyrians, and Thracians, as four separate ethnicities that composed Alexander's army. Here are the words of the Roman historian Curtius Rufus:<br/><br/>""Riding to the front line he (Alexander the Great) named the soldiers and they responded from pot to spot where they were lined up. The Macedonians, who had won so many battles in Europe and set off to invade Asia ... got encouragement from him - he reminded them of their permanent values. They were the world's liberators and one day they would pass the frontiers set by Hercules and Father Liber. They would subdue all races on Earth. Bactria and India would become Macedonian provinces. Getting closer to the Greeks, he reminded them that those were the people (the Persians on the other side) who provoked war with Greece, ... those were the people that burned their temples and cities ... As the Illyrians and Thracians lived mainly from plunder, he told them to look at the enemy line glittering in gold"" (Curt.3.10.4-10) <br/><br/>Notice what Alexander told the Macedonians - ""Bactria and India would become Macedonian provinces"". It is for the glory of Macedonia, not for the glory of Greece. The Greeks, are here a second nation of importance to Alexander.<br/><br/>Throughout Oliver Stone's film there is confusion whether the Macedonians were distinct people or just another Greeks. Ironically the original Synopsis of the film makes the clear distinction between Macedonians and Greeks. There we read: ""Alexander led his virtually invincible Greek and Macedonian armies through 22,000 milesHis extraordinary journey begins when Alexander launches his invasion from Macedonia""<br/><br/>Yet although in the Synopsis the Macedonians are separate from the Greeks, and they left from Macedonia and not from Greece, Stone has them fighting for the ""glory of Greece""?! The error is obvious.<br/><br/>2) Why the Macedonians and Greeks still hate each other today?<br/><br/>Macedonia is now divided between today's republic of Macedonia, Greece, and Bulgaria. The division occurred in 1912 when Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria occupied and partitioned the country, inflicting a tragic faith upon the descendents of Alexander.<br/><br/>In the 19th century Macedonia was occupied by the Turkish Ottoman Empire. The Macedonians then were well aware that they, and they alone, were the descendents of Alexander's Macedonians.<br/><br/>This is very important - in this same 19th century, the Greeks did not claim the ancient Macedonians as ""theirs,"" on the contrary. The works of the Greeks in the 18th and 19th centuries reveal that the Greeks did not regard the ancient Macedonians as Greeks, but foreigners who had conquered Greece (see Politis 1993:36; Dimaras 1958; Karagatsis, 1952). Politis had cited fourteen examples from the Greek literature from 1794 to 1841 in which the ancient Macedonians are excluded from the ancient Greek world (1993: 40-42).<br/><br/>With the occupation of southern Macedonia by Greece in 1912-13, everything changed. Greece needs its occupied Macedonian territory and created new propaganda to claim the ancient Macedonians as ""Greek"". Such propaganda is needed to justify the present occupation. This stealing of the Macedonian history by the Greeks is resented by the Macedonians who have long before the Greeks claimed descent from Alexander, and still do.<br/><br/>3) Why today's Macedonians are direct descendents of Alexander?<br/><br/>In 2001 it was genetically proved by a scientific team from Universidad Complutense in Madrid, Spain, that the ancient Macedonians and the ancient Greeks were two separate and distinct peoples. It also proved that the modern Macedonians are descendants of the ancient Macedonians of Alexander the Great, while the modern Greeks are not related to either the ancient or modern Macedonians. The lengthy scientific paper which was published and entitled ""HLA genes in Macedonians and the sub-Saharan origin of the Greeks"", concludes the following: <br/><br/>""Macedonians belong to the 'older' Mediterranean substratum, like Iberians (including Basques), North Africans, Italians, French, Cretans, Jews, Lebanese, Turks (Anatolians), Armenians and Iranians. Macedonians are not related with geographically close Greeks, who do not belong to the ""older"" Mediterranean substratum. Greeks are found to have a substantial relatedness to sub-Saharan (Ethiopian) people, which separate them from other Mediterranean groups. Macedonians are related to other Mediterraneans and do not show a close relationship with Greeks: however, they do with Cretans. This supports the theory that Macedonians are one of the most ancient peoples living in the Balkan peninsula, probably long before the arrival of the Mycaenian Greeks, about 2000 BC.""<br/><br/>Thus, genetically and scientifically had been proved not only that the ancient Macedonians were not Greeks, but that they are older then the ancient Greeks. You may read the full content of this genetic study at the following web address: http://www.makedonika.org/processpaid.aspcontentid=ti.2001.pdf<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Please consider the Macedonian position when approaching Stone's Alexander. Alexander and his Macedonians would have been appalled by Stone who had tried to make them fighting for Greece, when the ancient evidence says they did for Macedonia, because as the ancient authors testify they were not Greeks."

","Alex Sundered! by Doy Ariola<br/><br/>Days before I saw the movie, I was surprised to read American movie critics lambasting ""Alexander"". It was supposedly dull. Supposedly boring. Supposedly brain numbing. But my fascination with this movie project fueled me to watch it nonetheless.<br/><br/>When I did see the movie, I was even more surprised to see a huge turnout of people in the cineplex. Maybe because the audience had been preconditioned by the successes of ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Troy"" and ""King Arthur"". They were expecting the same grandeur and pomp. I must confess that I was expecting the same thing. But this time, we are getting something a little different. And I don't mean that as a compliment.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Sir Anthony Hopkins bedecked in pre-civilization garb in what is now the lost city of Alexandria. He gives us a history lesson on how things had come about in reference to the main character.<br/><br/>This little preamble is okay with me for a few seconds but three minutes later, it sounds like I'm in high school again. I don't know about you but I'm partial to movies who open with a little showing than telling. The gabfest continues, interrupted by either a sex scene or a war scene, or both. After almost three hours of hanging on, my concentration is sorely tested. And I have to say that ""Alexander"" was truly dull. Truly boring. Truly brain numbing. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone's supposed labor of love has rendered his work to be a laborious bore! It has great production design, but doesn't stray too far from movies of its ilk. The acting is good enough and Farrell really tries to be Lawrence of Arabia in a skirt. But the script just seems to jampack biopic info in a chatty and unwieldy manner that it leaves you as cold as the wedding bed the characters slept in.<br/><br/>One of the main attractions of this movie is for Colin Farrel's character to go like Sir Laurence Olivier in ""Spartacus"" and prefer both oysters and snails. But before you start recounting the raunchy scenes in Caligula, you'd be disappointed to find nothing short of titillating in the movie. There isn't even anything sexually gratuitous! The nude scenes are sparing and almost prudish. But effective enough to convey the emotions and to propel the story along. Though there aren't anything short of pornography, Stone clearly shows Alexander's bisexual proclivities and how it affected his people.<br/><br/>And to the male audience, the hyped nudity of Rosario Dawson is a letdown. Though we get to see her ample mammary glands, I was disappointed to see our vivacious Rosario overwhelmed by the overblown plot. The movie bunched up on the historical details that we fail to see her character develop and give her that opportunity to show her acting chops.<br/><br/>When Stone likes his movie sexually discreet, he pulls no stops in the gore and violence. Expect ""Braveheart"" proportions of severed heads, impaled bodies and blood by the buckets. Stone never lets us forget that the we are in a war epic.<br/><br/>But the problem about the scenes is its rather chaotic nature. Yes, the fight scenes were admirable in grandeur but, for the life of me, couldn't understand what was happening or what the lead character was trying to do. The scenes look terribly static to me. Moreover, I do not see how Alexander's mind works when it comes to war tactics and how his strategy works best at that time. We only see scenes where Alexander uses his charisma to lead a people in conquering lands. I don't suppose it was all dumb luck.<br/><br/>When it comes to actors, the only real notable performance didn't come from Farrel but Angelina Jolie. In this movie, Jolie goes Machiavellian hundreds of years earlier as she tries to emote Sophia Loren's character in Benhur. She plays the unlikely mother of Alexander, who stops at nothing to keep her son politically aligned to kingship. Imagine her to be the Greek version of Morgana Le Fay as she schemes quietly in the background like a soap opera bitch, dabbling in augury. Jolie hams it up as she uses snakes as fashion accessories and lives it up in Versace-like squalor, complete with a Medusa head. Plagued with countless close-ups, I have a tendency to just stare at her bloated lips moving, almost disembodied, as they utter with a Mediterranean accent. But mind you, she wasn't convincing as Alexander's mother.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, ""Alexander"" lacks soul. When it should try to overcome the back story, the movie failed to evolve from to its quagmire of details. It's a shopping list of textbook details that bogs down from too much gabbing and not enough ""moments"". You'll find yourself cheated out of something that should have been great."

","honestly the film was a flop, Colin clearly lacked the character strength to match what the audience expected of Alexander. Colin has this boyish careless character which showed too much in the the film, we didn't expect Alexander the great to be anything less than dead serious-forget the historics Stone was trying to portray. the opportunity naturally offered by a great story like that of Alexander was messed up by the poor acting of this movies cast. there was also the issue of overblown oratory which is mainly caused by over-directing, this can happen in the form of excessive script adherence which kills an actor's creativity. i personally expected a serious Alexander like Brad Pitt's Achilles in the movie Troy. You see, Colin Farel was not the guy for this movie, he doesn't just cut the cool and determined posture of a killer which is what Alexander was, the acting was not convincing and it could hardly immmerse a critical or attentive mind. take a look at 'The last Samurai' and you see what it means to get immersed. Lastly the battle scenes were regretable, am shocked to see someone compare them to that of Troy-impossible. Troy was an excellent movie through and through."

"Poseidon-3","Null","4","6","8 February 2007"," Alexander the Grating
","An obvious labor of love for director Stone, who had this project in mind for years and years before it was completed, it is nonetheless a flawed and only moderately entertaining film. At 175 minutes, but without a clear focus and lacking compelling characters, it's more an endurance test than a pleasing movie-going experience. A wildly miscast Farrell plays the legendary leader of Macedonia who strove to conquer most of the known world in the mid 300's BC. Pushed onward by a driven, passionate mother (Jolie) and at odds with his tough, war-mongering father (Kilmer), he trudges through every known land he can reach, crushing the rulers and either adopting the populaces or selling them into slavery, all in the name of creating a world kingdom. Meanwhile, he attempts to create an heir with his wives, the most notable one being Dawson, while carrying on a life-long love relationship with his right-hand man Leto. Farrell, who was hired on the cheap before his star-power was high enough to prevent it, is all wrong for the part. He tries valiantly to inject feeling and passion into the role, but it's such a poorly drawn character and he's so physically wrong for it that he is defeated more often than he succeeds with it. Some people just shouldn't be blonde, at least not in the succession of ghastly wigs, ranging from Shirley Jones-esquire numbers to Billy Ray Cyrus mullets, he is given here. His thick Irish accent is also far out of place. No matter what they say about it being deliberate, there is no way that Kilmer, with his flat American accent, and Jolie, who speaks as if she's Miss Transylvania, could produce and raise a child with that accent. Cosmetics and accents aside, Farrell just isn't heroic enough or inspiring enough to take on this type of role. Jolie, swathed in snakes during most every appearance, looks great, but goes way over the top, becoming something out of a dark fairy tale rather than a historical figure. Kilmer is surprisingly acceptable. His ham acting suits the bravado and position of his ruddy character. Leto, in almost all of his scenes, looks lost, opening his mouth and darting his eyes as if he'd like to say something, but doesn't know what. The only exceptions are a pair of scenes between him and Farrell in which some real emotion is dredged up. Dawson has a topless wedding night scene which is destined to go down in the annals of camp history forever. A tiresome, difficult to understand Hopkins plays Ptolemy in a snore-inducing prologue and epilogue (along with bits in between) that never should have seen the light of day. The soldiers are played by a variety of solid performers, some of whom, like Rhys-Meyers, are thoroughly wasted. Veterans Blessed and Plummer also have just brief cameo roles. Many of the lines of the script, as well as character names, are swallowed by the actors as they either sink into their characters or fight to be heard over the clanking swords or other background noises. The film was difficult to make and features several stunning sets and costumes. However, like virtually all other epic films these days, it's loaded down with CGI, rendering most of its vistas and hordes of soldiers unbelievable. (For a glimpse of a major military battle with REAL people assembled for it, take a look at 1970's ""Waterloo"".) In one scene Farrell gives an endless, rambling, inspirational speech to his men, of whom maybe a hundred or so can actually hear him, though he has 40,000 troops! While Stone is to be credited for not shying away from the bisexual aspects of the story, he tiptoes around it so uncomfortably and leaves it so unexamined that when it appears it actually comes off as gratuitous instead of organic to the material. The 1956 version of ""Alexander the Great"" may have fallen short in many areas, but this is a massive, bloated, misguided debacle that will eventually be snickered at the same way some folks look back upon other sword & sandal campfests. Unable to accept defeat himself, Stone has recut the film TWICE to date, but there is no way to fix a film in which the lead (along with others) is miscast."

","I'm a big fan of movies and will watch almost anything, from beginning to end. However, this was one of those movies that really tested my resolve. I cannot believe the ""star power"" involved in making this movie (Anthony Hopkins is among my favorite actors). The movie tried entirely too hard to become one of those critically acclaimed ""Epic"" films, and fell significantly short. I did not see the theatrical release, only the Director's Cut on DVD. Unless Oliver Stone significantly reworked the time-line of the movie for the director's cut, I can imagine that the theatrical release was just as confusing (not to mention, longer). The movie jumped backward and forward in time several times, and not in a linear fashion, making it a bit confusing to know what happened when (especially when you're dealing with a time period in the 350± BC era). There were also at least a couple of historical inaccuracies. At one point, one of Alexander's contemporaries used the British slang term ""sod,"" and it stuck out like a sore thumb. At another point, in Babylon (Persia), a woman was sitting with a domestic Persian cat on her lap, petting it. While domesticated cats MAY have been present then and there, having a Persian cat in Babylon seemed a little too convenient and I think the film could have done without it. If you are an animal lover, there are major portions of this film you won't want to watch. While I did not stay until the end of the credits for the Humane Association disclaimer for confirmation, there were several minutes worth of horses and elephants being speared, shot with arrows, trunks being sliced off, etc. While this may be historically accurate, is it really necessary in today's modern film-making? You can get the point across without so much gore. Shame on you Oliver."

Her scheming was mildly interesting, but each time she spoke it was hard not to laugh. In fact, it was hard not to laugh throughout the film, but more importantly, it was hard to be drawn into the film when every actor seemed like they were playing pretend.

I found the movie itself to be flawed. I don't care if Oliver Stone is beatified by the Pope; he has become enthralled by his own techniques and is a legend in his own lunch box. The constant shifts in time - present-10 years earlier-present-nine years earlier-present-nine years earlier, for example...with apparently no motive other than to provide some vision or memory for Alexander was just plain silly. The seaming together of certain scenes with Anthony Hopkins' rambling was just plain silly. And aside from the blurry, fast-speed, playing with colour battle-scenes, the thing I found most ridiculous was that many of the characters, the Companions, young Alexander, and even Philip/Val Kilmer (who's American for heaven's sake!), spoke with a kind of Irish/Celtic accent. Why is that? One could barely understand Rory McCann in his only speech. I know he can speak plainly, because I've seen him in other work. Stone, or the screenwriters he works with, has a penchant for characters who hold long diatribes and speeches full of sophomoric-metaphors. This medium is called MOV-IE for a reason. There must be action. If I want to hear a lecture, I'll go back to university. I could say more; however, those who agree with me know what I would say, and those who disagree with me will have long ago stopped reading. My 'recommendation' is see this movie if you aren't familiar with the history, but if you want entertainment with your Alexandrian history, read Marie Renault's excellent series on Alexander or even the several excellent nonfiction books on this remarkable world-maker."

Oliver Stones direction is more awful than imaginable, one of the worst jobs of direction ever, by one of the best directors. The screenplay is awful as well, the dialogue wooden, and everything else simply confusing. The visual effects are sometimes great, but usually they look so fake.

","Where to begin... first of all this story of Alexander, took place before Rome became powerful and before Julius Ceasar. Why do I mention this, because all the written works of Alexandria, was burned in a fire, where as per Julius Ceasars orders, were to burn the ships in the harbor, which unfortunately set fire to the great library of Alexandria. Which makes me wonder, where in the world did they come up with such a bad story to be made into a movie?? Now lets talk about the cast. It is always a pleasure to see Angelia Jolie, she is a good actress. Anthony Hopkins always is great to watch. We all know Val Kilmer chooses his roles wisely an always gives a good performance. Colin Farrel has his good moments, but in my opinion, did not sell the role of Alexander. Maybe it was because of the director, Oliver Stone. What in the hell was he putting in his coffee?? As far as battle tactics, it was a pure joke. In the fist battle, you have infantry running along side of Alexander and his calvary. What did Alexander give his men before the battle,, JOLT Cola?? The second battle was just as bad as the first. What was Oliver Stone thinking of in the last battle???? We all laugh when Alexander fell in battle and later his men carried him on what looked like a large shield,,, with the spear still in his chest,,, please give me a break.!!! Collin Farrel did not have what it takes to be in a part like this,, sorry. Least we forget, Alexander's sexual desires,, I think, it was played on a little too much. Hell, with watching this movie, I can see where the country of Greece got such a bad reputation. I gave this movie a 3, mainly for a few actors that played their part well,, Collin Farrel was not one of them and with honorable mention, Alexander's horse gave one hell of a performance.

The movie however does not focus on what Alexander is most known for, but rather focuses on supposedly his personal life...I think? Although he conquered so many places, the movie ""Alexander"" shows only two battles, and really does not make them seem that epic or exciting. The movie has a great cast, but unfortunately, do not act very well. Colin Farrel overacts, acting as if this were a Shakespearean stage play. Angelina Jolie looks younger than Colin Farrel, and is supposed to be Alexander's mother. She speaks with a Russian sounding accent, but I thought she was supposed to be Greek? Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite actors, manages to lull me to sleep as he tells the ""GREAT"" tale of Alexander. The chronology of this movie is all out of sequence. One example, in the beginning of the movie, they mention Alexander's father was murdered, but they don't show it until the end of the movie. The movie was confusing, poorly acted, and most of the scenes were Alexander yelling about how no thinks he's ""great"", people telling Alexander how ""great"" he is, or everyone lounging around in palaces getting drunk. The movie is almost 3 hours long, and does not make it worthwhile. The documentary on the History Channel about Alexander the Great was so much more interesting."
"mish234","3","4","6","9 June 2005"," My review
","Well, I didn't expect much when i rented this DVD in the first place. Needless to say, that's pretty much exactly what I got. People who are expecting to see a film made on the life of Alexander the Great, emperor of Macedonia will be sadly disappointed. Colin Farell, perpetual Bad-Boy of Hollywood, tries (and tries hard) to justice to this role but somehow..... fails. Don't ask me why director Oliver Stone ever thought he would be appropriate for this role. The film starts off weirdly enough: Angelina Jolie with child Alexander in a room full of snakes where she warns him (in an accent I found to be French) that people are like snakes- they can turn on you. Original. Most of the film is historically incorrect- check out the goofs section of this movie. Although I appreciate that fact that the movie makers were essentially trying to tell the story of the man behind the battles, they screwed up. As for the characters themselves- you begin to get tired of Alexander and find yourself wishing he'd hurry up and die at the end. The relationship between Alexander and Hephaestion (Jared Leto) has been... well... all right they're supposedly gay. Now I have no problems with homosexuals at all, but the way it has been shown in this film you begin to wonder whether Alexander was just plain lazy to fall in love with a woman. They don't seem to have highlighted the fact that maybe Alexander and Hephaestion had a relationship beyond sexual desires. And when he does eventually get a girl- Roxane (Rosario Dawson)- there's as much heat in that relationship as in the peaks of the Himalayas. One bedroom scene and that's all that there is to it. Kinda like a relationship with Colin Farell. They tried to show many facets of himself but somehow ended up showing Alexander as a confused king- he wants power, doesn't know why he wants it and doesn't know what to do with it. He has a love-hate relationship with his mother, a respect-hate relationship with his father. He seems to be gentlemanly enough, and then suddenly there's blood lust. That's all fine, but the transition between these emotions isn't very smooth. Overall, the movie seems hotch-potch. Certain scenes are too overworked- most of the lines sound corny and don't have the effect it's supposed to have. Don't expect to go see a classic- you're better with ""Gladiator"" and Russel Throw Tele- I mean Crowe."

Colin Farell as Alexander, it just doesn't really click, or at least likely able to associate this actor with the Macedonian ruler. The blond hair was looked fake, poorly done, and his Irish accent kept leaking through at many points during his speeches. Then there is the unbelievably HOTT Angelina Jolie who is good, (in other movies) but here she over did it and she's like a year older than Colin Farrel! How can she really play his mother? When they had an intimate mother-son moment, it looked like they were going do it! And using the very accomplished Anthony Hopkins was a good idea, but we do not need to hear him talking throughout the entire movie! The movie moved unbearably slow, and instead of showing the audience Alexander's great accomplishments, it is told like a school lecture. Not a good way to keep the audience enthralled and excited. The fight scenes were horrendous, I could not figure out where everyone else was because of all the close up shots on their feet and faces. And during those fight scenes I did not get the indication of Alexnader's presence as a great warrior. Every time he went up to kill the main guy, he MISSED! And there were only TWO battle scenes! The dialog was like a cheesy, pompous, ripoff of Shakespere. Not a great film. Oliver Stone should look at his earlier work like Platoon (one of my favorites) and examine why it is still such a good movie and learn from the other good and memorable epic films."

And what's with the heavy Scottish brogue.....""Alexander, we luv ya! We'll follow ya ta the ends of the earth laddie."" Com'on man! Not to mention Farrel's Irish lilt and Angelina Jolie sounding like Count Dracula's mother. What was Stone thinking. Well...he wasn't. He was too wrapped up in getting every word of his boring laborious dialog into the film. Battle scenes...good, costuming and set design good. If Ridly Scott had directed this, perhaps we would have had an ""Alexander"" at full potential."

","Well I have seen the film and to be honest it looks like an epic and its one hundred percent an epic . The story may be slow at times but how can you condense true greatness into 3 hours, Mr Stone has near dammed done it, short of having another 3 hours , to tell this story of a man who's like has inspired many generals and leaders. The battle scenes are on a true epic scale , the story doesn't always dwell on the blood and gore but Mr Stone entwines the relationship with Alexander and his male lover and his wife Roxanne in a sensitive way, Mr Stone conveys Alexanders passion to conquer and inspire his army and also . The photography of the eagle flying above instills a sense of magnitude and the battle scenes in the jungle with the blood and red leaves entwine and draw in the viewer haunting , go see it ,its true work of art and a fitting tribute to Alexander Greatness ."

","Prior to seeing this movie I have looked at it's small rating on IMDb, listened to some friends saying it's bad and had all my hopes down to the ground. But I was so interested in a historical movie so I fired up my player and I am glad I did it. The story is good (I do not know if it follows exactly the history lane), also the fighting scenes are good (especialy those involving the last battle in the woods), even tho they do not have the same grander as those big fights in LOTR or Troy. The actors do their job pretty well, very nice performance by Colin Farrell doing Alexander. See this movie. Do not let yourself intimidated about those saying it's a gay movie (as I see many do), because it's not."
"dixxjamm","9","11","23","17 January 2005"," Oliver Stone is surprising,as always
","I am a very big fan of Oliver Stone. One of the things I like about him is that he always surprises me,no matter how ""predictable"" he may seem. Here are my comments: 1. I didn't read any comments here on IMDb that said this is not a typical 100% historical movie.I am surprised,because a lot has been said about this movie. Some of Alexander's and Ptolemy's monologues and some ideas that come from this movie have references on very actual issues: East meets West,tolerance to other cultures (mainly Eastern culture).Stone risks a lot here by trying to add this kind of ideas to an already very complex subject.He may have overdone it a bit,but it would be nice to imagine Alexander having Gandhi or Martin Luther King type of ideas.Of course,it is extremely hard to imagine a ruthless military leader preaching racial and cultural tolerance to his battle-hardened generals,but hey, Napoleon is also an example that such peculiar personalities do exist.So, it seems plausible,and historical facts do support this theory about Alexander. 2. About casting: I think Colin Farell was a good choice.A lot have said that he was too today-looking and lacked the greatness of Alexander.But who really knows what Alexander was like? Stone and Farell delivered a perfectly believable character. Kilmer and Jolie were excellent, and also the others were good choices, as far as I am concerned. 3. About the bisexuality theme: no comments here, except that maybe Americans should try to be a little less puritan (it is the 21-st century,grow up!) 4.Screenplay and story were excellent.Very original and very dramatic.The subject was extremely demanding and Stone did a very good job. 5. I think it is a shame that the movie was so criticized. Very underrated movie. 6.Allthough overall Vangelis' music was OK, I do think that he could have done a better job. The battle scenes music (esp.the one at Gaugamela) is a bit too common. 7.The Oscars and the Golden Globes have proved, one more time, that they are sometimes blind. This movie definitely deserved more recognition. The comparison with ""Gladiator is mostly incorrect. Ridley Scott is very different from Oliver Stone. Of course, you can make some comparisons (afterall, it is about antiquity, emotions, heroics, love and so on). I thought Gladiator was a great movie, and so is Alexander. But Alexander was about a very known figure and it set itself a higher target. And Gladiator does have a big flaw in the story, which is Commodus in the arena (that was uninspired, Mr. Scott), just like another excellent Scott film, Black Hawk Dawn, with those last dialogs btw soldiers (cheesy!). But that's just the point. Stone, in most of his movies, is unable (I think he does that on purpose) to deliver a final punch. So, for those viewers that want an ending, no matter how absurd, Scott makes it better (but loses its artistic value in the process). So 2 great directors, but different, Stone takes more risks and usually has a very personal agenda. My rating is 9/10, because of 2 minuses: didn't really enjoy Vangelis and those Hopkins monologues were a bit forced. Overall, wonderful."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","7","13","19 August 2006"," Rating: 5.4. Are you kidding me? Do you people need any Anti-Motion Sickness pills whilst riding that the hating bandwagon?
","I may like Oliver Stone a great deal, but I am no fawning fanboy (-girl?) of his and am still able to spot poor quality in his films. This is not one of them. Alexander is a flawed masterpiece. It is an original fare, not really relying on any hackneyed formulas or stunning visual effects to get the message across or else mask poor writing. Everything is out in the open--bold, blunt and vivid. It moves back into storytelling mode, exploring the character of Alexander and what drives him to set out on the Persian Crusades. What is the force behind his insatiable conquering hunger?<br/><br/>The film never technically answers this question but it offers several explanations. Alexander's bruised relationship with his father. Alexander's mother complex. Alexander's inherent love for people and Greece. Alexander's wish to unite these two under the banner of his idealism.<br/><br/>Putting forth these explanations, Alexander zooms in on the aging Ptolemy I (Hopkins) who retells the story of Alexander the Great for history students. He often drones in memories; when the story he tells is exciting it regrettably cuts back to Ptolemy; there is too much philosophizing, but it still works. About the philosophy part - this is a negative aspect in Alexander (2004). There is far too much philosophizing and inner monologue in the dialogue to be effective. The film itself is introspective enough, so there is absolutely no need to take that approach in dialogue too.<br/><br/>So much like its character, Alexander (2004) has its ups and downs. The deep necks of Asia and its artistic portrayal being an up and Angelina Jolie's freaky acting and Translyvanian-sounding accent being a down. The pseudo-philosophy being another. Other than this, however, I think this is a masterful film with beautiful portrayals of history and settings. It is patient and careful -- at times falling prey to epic scenarios, giving us a taste of dramatic battles, emotions and landscapes only to jerk it away again and go into delicate mode. It entices the viewer with epic elements, instead of dishing out huge doses of gore galore in battle to keep one's interest Bruckheimer-style. It's refined and assured direction.<br/><br/>And lastly, because it is impossible to get away from this controversy...the gay portrayal issue:<br/><br/>I liked the fact that Oliver Stone shied away from the strongest homosexual elements in Alexander. Why? Because including daring rapports with his lover would have been a cop-out, crammed in to shock audiences and thereby get some free publicity and praise for being outspoken. Stone didn't feel as if he needed to do this, so he focused on other things instead. He still kept the gay elements to stay true to the historical account, but he never bothered to give them much importance. I think that is the best thing he can do, because it shows he does not think homosexuality is an issue -- it is a natural thing. It should be given no more screen time than any other aspect of Alexander's life. <br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Cyrus and Darius knitted together the largest empire known before or since. Their method was innovative, to allow local control preserving the culture and gods. What they added was infrastructure: roads, a universal set of laws (the first case law) weights and monetary system.<br/><br/>The system was perhaps the least corrupt of any complex government before and since. Gathered in Persepolis were scholars tasked with collecting and synthesizing knowledge from the entire world. Darius knew that any oaf can conquer, but only a statesman  a concept he invented  can govern.<br/><br/>300 years later the system had devolved, and various component states no longer saw advantage with the Persian federation. Into this, a bold and athletic thug moved. There were some spectacular battles of course, but most of the conquering was a matter of showing up in force.<br/><br/>When Alexander reached Persepolis he committed the greatest sin against knowledge known: he destroyed the great libraries, killed all the scholars and burned the entire place to the ground. <br/><br/>The one great invention of the Greeks was the principle of retrospective narrative, what we call history. Since they wrote the history, they get to choose the narrative. Their spinning is masterful, complex and rich. But all the components are borrowed, not original.<br/><br/>Now Stone makes a movie depicting what he thinks are key elements of the story. Stone has no original cinematic vision, all is borrowed from giants who went before. What he brings to the table is the ability to spin it together with some deftness, some craft. At least that once was the case.<br/><br/>Two narratives, the original and this pale child. Borrowed, but this doesn't have the typical Greek riches.

I think Colin played the role of Alexander very well aside from still sounding Irish. Angelina Jolie was great. I think the casting was OK...Jared Leto and Colin Farrell's relationship in the movie at first was a little hard to follow...I wasn't sure if the relationship was open and everyone knew or they hid it.

"Adorable","8","9","18","1 February 2005"," Great Historic Number
","Alexander was definitely and unarguably one of the pleasanter slights of hand in 2004. Surprising for its clarity and compelling impetus, the gigantic Oliver Stone undertaking could easily have wallowed in self-indulgence and amounted to little more than pomp and circumstance. However, through innovative takes on more or less accepted history, capable cast members and a sweeping saga of a story, Stone's Alexander actually made it to the frontlines of the annals of cinema relatively unscathed.<br/><br/>Many expected the worst from this rendition, fearing it won't measure up to existing entries in its genre. Yet Alexander was nowhere near most recent counterparts in mindset or production values, such as Ridley Scott's Gladiator and Petersen's Troy, and deployed far less visceral action, replacing it with poetic recounting of the great Hellenic ruler's escapades, in addition to controversial elements pertaining to the king's sexual orientation.<br/><br/>Indeed, there were quite a few battle segments, most notably the Gaugamela encounter with Darius's great Persian army, and later Alexander with his hapless forays into India. These were certainly exciting and well done, especially when depicting Alexander's League forces as they went head to head with monstrous war elephants. However, what made this film so enticing was the overall scope of matters, imbued as it was with succulent parts tragedy, documentary epic and outright soap opera. From his humble beginnings as heir to the Macedonian throne, Alexander was brought up to become the great leader, and often despot, that he eventually turned into. Along his path were strewn countless bodies, rendered thus either through heroic sacrifice in battle or cruel backdrop politics, assassination and betrayal. But the underlying theme of manifest destiny never left Alexander, as he led seemingly diverse, and frequently antagonized, factions on a joint quest eastward, in a bid to reach heights of power never before attained.<br/><br/>All of this was captured well enough in Alexander. Although falling short of certain hallmarks and standards set by earlier The Passion of Christ in that it didn't feature authentic language and speech (opting for the rather trite pseudo-Olde English trick instead), Stone's pet project nonetheless provided a comprehensive entertainment package, so long as you didn't anticipate copious deluges of top notch action or unrivaled historic fidelity. This movie was all about the ride, and with over 180 minutes under its runtime belt, a major ride it was indeed, packed to the gills with quality storytelling, excellent period moods and even laudable CGI.<br/><br/>The cast did wonderfully, alternating between the subtle and the grossly over the top with panache. Colin Farrell, as Alexander, didn't necessarily lead the group per se, but being such a natural thespian overall managed a satisfying, robust role. Bear in mind this feature required him to carry out several dimensions of the same character, including obsessive conqueror, timid introvert, manic lover and shadowy conspirator.<br/><br/>Better suited to their roles, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer finally got opportunities to live down bad memories. The former excelled as Alexander's wicked sorceress mom Olymphias, allowing us to at last forget about her miserable appearance in Tomb Raider 2, while the latter returned to the screen in his best role since The Salton Sea, this time around conveying King Philip, Alexander's unruly father and Macedonia's national figurehead. Much of the kudos for making the picture so atmospheric belonged with more supportive members, in particular the lead protagonist's many deputies and warlords, like Ptolemy (Elliot Cowan), Attalus (Nick Dunning) and Cleitus (Gary Stretch). Rosario Dawson, too, was impressive as Farrell's main female companion, doing (no pun intended) Roxanne, Persian captive-wife of Alexander. We even got to see Dawson and her considerable physical assets in full nudity, which was an experience not hastily forgotten.<br/><br/>And of course, always on the verge of quitting the movie business but not there yet, Anthony Hopkins delivered a prolonged, multi-part cameo as an old Ptolemy, comfortable in a PC-generated version of Alexandria, Egypt, and retelling the world-changing campaign for historians to record. This enabled viewers to conceive of a context for the hefty tale, putting events and other building blocks in perspective.<br/><br/>And perspective was one of this movie's chief accomplishments. It was a tribute to tumultuous, important times brimming with legendary names, yet wasn't sucked into hackneyed superlatives or cheapened, crowd-pleasing action compromises. Alexander succeeded in giving people a memorable lesson in our world's history, while never letting its grip over quality and entertainment levers loosen noticeably. Plus, it had a bit of a titillating bite to it, which invariably helped. Excellent in most departments, and most obviously worth inspection."

"Sedling","10","9","18","29 November 2004"," Outstanding.
","Director Oliver Stone's retelling of Alexander The Great's life begins with a quote from The Aenid, ""Fortune favours the bold."" And bold is exactly what this film is. <br/><br/>Legendary for more than two millennium for the amazing deeds that he packed into his short life (he died at the age of 32), Alexander The Great, King of Macedon, is the most celebrated figure of classical antiquity. Stone's film version of Alexander's life presents an intimate and fascinating portrait of the man who, in less than two decades, created the greatest empire the world has ever seen, acquiring a semi-mythic status that persists to this day.<br/><br/>Drawing on theories, fact and folklore, the film - which clocks in at three hours - explores all aspects of Alexander's eventful life and reign in a non-chronological, non-linear account. Among the many topics depicted are: Alexander's family life (including his stormy relationship with his father, King Philip, and the influence of his mother, Queen Olympias), his brilliant leadership, outwitting one opponent after another and inspiring his devoted troops to accomplish amazing physical feats, and his daily life off-duty - whether sharing the hardships of his men or indulging in the legendary bouts of feasting that may have contributed to his early death. But perhaps the theme most present is the relationship between Alexander (Colin Farrell) and Hephaistion (his most adored lover, portrayed by Jared Leto) which is analogous to the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus (two mythic heroes from Homer's The Illyiad, most recently depicted in Wolfgang Peterson's Troy).<br/><br/>The film begins with a young Alexander getting advice on life from a variety of sources. His mother, played by Angelina Jolie, uses snakes to demonstrate to importance of decisive actions during battle: ""If you hesitate, she will strike. Never hesitate,"" she tells him, adding, ""My little Achilles."" Alexander's early potential is seen in his ability to tame wild horses (like Hector in The Illyiad). With the companionship of Hephaistion, Alexander grows to become a mighty conqueror, traveling through Macedonia, Egypt, Babylonia, Persia and India - places others before him had never ventured.<br/><br/>Here is the boldness that sets this film apart from other classical epics. Unlike Troy, which changed the lover-lover relationship of Achilles and Patroclus to cousins for the consumption of conservative American audiences, Alexander makes no attempt to alter history. Alexander, like many of his time, was bisexual, unphased by the boundaries of gender. While Oliver Stone chose not to include a homosexual love scene in this film, there is plenty of expressed emotions, caresses and hugging, innuendos and metaphors, and even a couple of smooches. Secondly, his depiction of Alexander as anti racist and respectful of women is also a bold choice. Where Troy was misogynistic and blatantly propagated an ""us"" versus ""them"" mentality, Alexander displays the utmost respect for women and views rape as one of the most heinous crimes one can commit. But of course, like any hero, he begins to suffer the catastrophic fates of his revered Gods: Achilles, Medea, Oedipus and Prometheus. <br/><br/>There is plenty of eye-candy in this film and Stone spares no expense to draw his spectators into this world of glory, courage, passion, murder, conspiracy and adventure. Several times throughout, we are literally offered a bird-eye view of Alexander's battles. In these battles, Stone has a tendency to overuse the close-up angle to blur the action, simulating the confusion, intensity and rapidity of hand-to-hand combat. Sounds of crushed bones, exploding veins, bodies thrashing, chariots rumbling and horses (sometimes elephants!) wailing penetrate each battle scene.<br/><br/>Stone also has a brilliant eye for depicting the sumptuousness of Alexander's royal life. Jewel-encrusted robes, gilded ornate palaces with intricate detail and reliefs, succulent feasts of wild boar and sweet wines, and tantalizing harems filled with bevies of beauties (unfortunately, someone forgot to tell Stone that harem women didn't shave their pits, pluck their eyebrows, wax their bikini zones, or get cavity fillings in those days). Each scene is given a sweeping tribal score, composed by Vangelis (Chariots Of Fire), which furthers our plunge into this world.<br/><br/>Of course, no epic feature is complete without fire-infused performances by the actors (not counting Titanic, of course.). Colin Farrell, sporting a historical version of the mullet, surprised me with his honest and passionate Alexander. He tackles the multi-facedness of his character with the skill of a warrior poet. Rosario Dawson wins our hearts immediately after performing her intricate Dance Of The Seven Veils, yet doesn't get the screen time she deserves. Val Kilmer also delivers a complex performance as a father who loves and curses his son simultaneously. Angelina Jolie gives the most stellar dramatic performance of her career (although for some reason, she speaks through a Russian accent). The only stale performance is delivered, unexpectedly, from Anthony Hopkins, who plays an elderly Ptolemy, narrating the action. Hopkins monotonously narrates like a ninth grade History teacher (reminiscent of Ben Stein in ""Ferris Bueler's Day Off"") with numbers, dates, and places. Bor-ring. <br/><br/>The only time this film falters is when it delves into Hollywood formulas. But unlike other Hollywood epics (Gladiator), Alexander is not fiction or myth - he was real. <br/><br/>I wonder if Alexander weeps when he looks through the spectre of time and sees that we've given his title of ""The Great One"" to Wayne Gretzsky.<br/><br/>**** out of *****"

","I think ""Alexander"" is a really good movie. I think it's great that there are not soooo many battles and action-sequences in it. It's a movie that shows us the personality and the psychological side of this great conqueror. The movie is exciting and thrilling though there are more dialogs than battles - which is really unusual for a movie like this. The violence in the battles is showed very detailed but I think this is important because it shows that war is not something heroical but something real cruel.

","I have seen the film and thought it was brilliant on an epic scale, it was probably the 'size' of the scope that has prevented it US success.<br/><br/>I guess for it to have worked in the US it may have been better to have made the film focus on a particular element, (ie, conquest of Babylon), but i suspect Europe will be able to absorb it better as it is easier for us to recognise the conquests on a map under more Ancient names. I am sure this will become a popular film once it hits the rental market as the Americans will be able to concentrate more.<br/><br/>The sets were great and the infusion of the 'other' world cultures in his court and resulting tensions were illustrated well and is still a relevant prejudism today.<br/><br/>I hope this does succeed overall as i would hate its perceived complexity to ruin chances of further ambitious films being made in the future and prevent the work of the actors to not be recognised.

I truly believe that despite the fact that Colin Farrell looked like a rock star straight from the 80s Def Leppard/Poison hairspray and spandex period and Angelina Jolie's accent was very odd, the film itself was a major achievement and at par with Gladiator. In addition, in my humble opinion, it was even better than Wolfgang Petersen's Troy. The movie was both cerebral and action packed and Oliver Stone did a magnificent job of creating a person that was larger than life and showed his greatest achievements at such a young age. Bottom line: kudos to Oliver Stone, Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Jared Leto, Anthony Hopkins and the rest of the cast for keeping history alive in a time where history seems all but forgotten.

","I was gob-smacked. Was I supposed to really take it seriously? Unable to use the magic of film to construct a story, right from the start we have to be subjected to a very old fashioned device (not even listen!) of Anthony Hopkins narrating a story with backdrops reminiscent of Cecil de Mille films. I was expecting a film that although would satisfy Hollywood audiences would also somehow project the greatness of Alexander. What came across was an unverifiable account of a man struggling with his own adolescent neurosis, some Black Beauty bonding with a horse, some mixing of myth with reality and no clear indication of his motives to push East. Was war the only realistic solution he had to expand his empire? Was the decision to stop further advances really based on a near fatal injury endured in war? It sounded like the logic and reasoning of a spoilt brat not a statesman! The death of the beautiful Ephastius was as predictable as it was cringing. Hinting at the birth of the Suez canal? I was half expecting Alexander predicting the discovery of the Americas and the founding of a city called New Alexandria!! Admittedly some parts were stunning, the final battle scene, the Baudolinoesque advance into the unknown but one grew tired of the guilt ridden uneasy glances which pointed out the conspirators, the snakes, the never ageing tomb raider mother with a Lithuanian accent. I came out of it thinking that this Alexander was rather small."

Happily, these times were soon over... till today. I'm not saying it's too bad, I think Hollywood just needs to live through another crisis to become better again. Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, King Arthur... I never could understand what's the meaning in these movies. But when I saw Alexander I thought for the moment - cinema is dead.

Angelina Jolie was the best in a bad bunch, Colin Farrell as Alexander was an absolutely awful choice as lead, now why to all of the above? In the Battle scenes the music was neither triumphant nor tragic, uplifting or saddening, it was just....kind of an afterthought, it stirred no emotion or empathy i just felt nothing. Alexanders first address to his army was an absolute joke he looked pathetic and sounded ridiculous. Your in front of your army and your supposed to whip them into a fury, think about it, the Greeks are outnumbered by at least 3-1 and up to 10-1 by the Persians, the greatest empire in the world at the time, wouldn't you need a little more encouragement than what was given (a-la Mel Gibson in Braveheart). Colin Farrell as the lead (what was Oliver thinking), he has no physical presence, no leadership qualities, hes not a great orator, and by all historical accounts Alexander was a Man of Awesome presence, shouldn't this hold true for the person who pretends to be him?. Brad Pitt now there is the man who would have been perfect for the lead, but as we all know he was busy at the time. Colin Farrell is a bad actor even on his best day, he was woeful in this epic, he would have done much better as an hephastion. When you watch this movie did Colin Farrell stir any emotion, apart from complete disdain for his mediocre acting abilities? Did you feel sad when hephastion died? What about when Philip is murdered, or even parvenu? these are all characters central to the History of Alexander the Great yet we feel nothing when they pass. This is only my opinion but I felt nothing during this film, there were no feelings of elation or despair, amusement or disgust, sadness or happiness, there were no highs or lows, Oliver Stone imparted none of this to me."

","I am staggered that anyone could find something amazing to say about this film. I sat for the full 3 hours and was very disappointed that a story that could have been turned into an epic was so disjointed that it became confusing. It was rather like watching a decorator putting up wallpaper without having a clue where it is supposed to go and at what angle or what colour in the confusion it becomes a distorted mess. I was looking forward to the battle scenes in the anticipation that they would make the film worthwhile sitting through the rest of the dialogue but sadly again a missed opportunity. The battle scenes didn't save it either. Unlike Gladiator where you could understand why Maximus takes the course of action he does to win a battle and demonstrates his leadership; or even more recently TROY where Achilles demonstrates why he was deemed a god and shows his leadership. Sadly in Alexander- Alexander states his intentions much to the surprise and shock of his generals- states what he intends to do but then we really cannot see how he achieves this. When flashbacks are thrown in during the film without a clue as to there relevance at that time it takes on epic proportions instead of becoming an epic for the right reasons! How Oliver Stone never took the golden opportunity of making this into an epic and taking a leaf from Gladiator and Troy in making it thus is beyond me. I am no super director but I am sure I could have made a better effort on the budget available. My only praise is for Anthony Hopkins who narrates well and makes an attempt (probably without his knowledge) to piece this disjointed effort together."

","Alexander the Great was a leader of men, and a great conqueror of nations. In his short life, he conquered around 90% of the then known world, creating the largest empire known. From the Persian's and Babylon, to the gates of India, he seemed unstoppable in his conquest. This film focuses mainly on the epic campaign, but with some history about the man himself, and those around him.<br/><br/>Many harsh words have been spoken about this film, with critics deriding it a truly terrible film. This is not really fair, as there is a good film here, just it is buried amongst some of the worst film-making decisions ever. Let's start with the good points.<br/><br/>The cast are all really passionate in their roles. Farrell, an unlikely choice for the lead, surprises by being powerful, emotional, and brutal to an amazing degree. The support cast around him are mostly brilliant (the exception I will get to in a bit). Stone directs with a wonderful vision, capturing the beauty of the settings, and the bloodiness of battle, although the occasional ""wobbly camera"" does irritate. The 'swooping eagle' view of the battlefield in particular is breathtaking. The general story is strong, and engrossing to a degree.<br/><br/>Where the film suffers are in some ropey factors such as the accents, the extrapolation of plot, and the truly dull voice-over. Accents first, with Farrell in the lead role, for some strange reason the decision was made that, as he is Irish, everyone around him should be Irish too! Why this occurred I have no idea, but you are left with a load of terrible accents ruining some strong lines (and turning some comical). None are worse than Kilmer, the weakest link in the acting on screen. A worse accent hasn't been heard since Heath Ledger in Ned Kelly! I don't' recall this being done for films with Sean Connery in (an actor notorious for being Scottish no matter the role). The rest of the Red October crew didn't try to be from Edinburgh. By making everyone Irish, Stone has distanced the film from the 'historical accuracy' he claims he wanted to depict. It looks even worse when you see that no-one seemed to tell Angelina Jolie about the idea, so she tries desperately to put on a Macedonian accent.<br/><br/>The plot seems insistent on hammering home some factors. One example is Alexander's love for his best friend, Hephaistion. Every 10 minutes we are reminded of their undying love by a minute or two of gazing. After the first few times, you generally get the point and the later interruptions (which get longer still) just break up the rest of the film. Overall there must be around 30 minutes of film wasted in this manner. With the Anthony Hopkins voice-over telling the story, it is surprising I managed to stay awake! The first ten minutes consisted of him droning on about something or otherÂ…sorry I lost interest as he really tell the tale in the dullest, most boring way imaginable! Only once the film itself kicked in did I spark up and take note. Every now and again, Hopkins would waffle on to tell us what we missed, and the mind would wander whilst he did so.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw in this film, however, is the decision to suddenly skip the story from his exile to him being King. I thought I had fallen asleep and missed a huge chunk of plot, and for 90 minutes was wondering what happened to his father, what had I missed, when did he come home, and why is he fighting everyone! Then, 40 minutes from the end the missing scene is shown as a flashback. It served the film no purpose placing it late in the film, and in fact served to the detriment of the end result.<br/><br/>As I said, there is a good film in here somewhere. I reckon around 1 hour 45 mins of good film. It is just that it is muddled in with 1 hour 15 mins of bad. Seems like a decent ratio, but you need to ask yourself if you really want to spend 3 hours watching an average film?"

","""Conquer your fear, and I promise you'll conquer death."" <br/><br/>Expectations were reasonably high when Alexander was about to be released, and, obviously, hardly anyone considered it a good film. But I was surprised, since I never found this 3-hour epic to be boring at all. From the dazzling opening credits, to the probably unnecessary childhood scenes, the film immediately had me hooked and I never looked at the clock once. Stone's unnecessary flashback scene(s) might be distracting from the ongoing story, and, to be honest, Alexander never truly felt all that great in the film. Stone focused more on his weaknesses instead of his triumphs, probably forgetting how this man became remembered up to this day. But his weaknesses, in some way, managed to establish Alexander as a character, a character that was flawed despite his many achievements at such a young age. And, really, no one ever truly believed in his dreams, but his determination to achieve the impossible, while it seems mad for some, was his strength.<br/><br/>I can certainly understand people's disappointment though: Anthony Hopkins's non-stop ramblings of things we don't care about, the uneven pacing, laughable romance scenes between Alexander and Hephaistion, and some even considered most of the performances to be over-the-top. While the romance between Alexander and Hephaistion was never really convincing, I never found it laughable at all (which is probably the worst thing that can happen), but the writers simply treated it as something abnormal, something that would be extremely cheesy had you replaced one of the characters with a woman, but it never bothered me at all. Hopkins' narration was out of place and didn't seem all that necessary, and that last scene was not at all a satisfying way to end the film. But, again, I didn't have any problems with it at all, and it helps that Hopkins was amazing in the film.<br/><br/>The performances were all outstanding. Sure, Anjelina Jolie playing Farrell's mother in the film, when in reality they're only 1 year older apart, was ridiculous, but they were both amazing in their scenes together. Jolie gives a tour-de-force performance as the tragic and compelling Olympias, and I absolutely loved her in all her scenes, especially between her and Alexander. While Colin Farrell, who has proved long ago that he wasn't just another pretty face, is very good as Alexander, and was able to pull off all of the scenes between him and Leto. Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins also provide outstanding supporting performances. The script, despite having many flaws character and story-wise, was superb, and the exchanges between characters were excellent and felt ordinary instead of being completely strange.<br/><br/>Where Stone, I think, somewhat failed at the characters and story, was more than successful in his direction of this epic film. The battle scenes (of which there were surprisingly few) are outstanding and very, very well done. I especially loved the bird's eye-view of the massive scale of the battle between the Greeks and Asians. But the battle in India, deemed as the bloodiest defeat Alexander faced, is easily the best, and reached such an astounding climax that had me holding my breath. Stone's well-crafted battle scenes were highly entertaining, and, thankfully, only used slow-motion at one occasion, while short and only had two opposing characters, reached such great heights of epic proportions.<br/><br/>Vangelis' beautiful score was perfect for all the scenes, either it be dramatic or exciting. The colorful sets and costumes were a treat to watch, and the cinematography was excellent as well. Alexander, to some, is nothing more than a well-done film with beautiful sets that feels empty and hollow. It's a flawed film all right, and could've been appreciated by more people had the story been treated differently, but I'm happy with how the film turned out. I'm sure that Stone has done better films than this (I've only seen Any Given Sunday), but I was wholly impressed by his achievement in the film, while keeping outstanding visuals, action and performances. And, more importantly, I felt that he successfully told the story of a young man who, with his determination and will power, achieved more than what any of them could even dream of, and also brought him to his inevitable downfall.<br/><br/>9.2"
"karlox_s","Null","8","16","12 February 2005"," Why you should wait and rent it, to be shown on TV, or spend your time on something else.
","This is not a historical movie. You can say it's an epic, or a somewhat entertaining movie. But it misses too many things to state it was a faithful movie about this character or what he did.<br/><br/>Reasons and spoilers, below.<br/><br/>The main problem here, is that if Stone really consulted any expert, he certainly didn't pay attention to the part where the erudite told him why is Alexander an important character in world history. And if he did, he obviously ignored it, being rather delighted to show the audience what his sexual preferences or psychological traumas were, as if rejoicing to show he was a human and not a myth. And even when those things are needed and definitely add an important depth to the character, it's not because of that that he's remembered to such an extent these days. And thus, valuable movie time was wasted, basically repeating the same scenes over and over again.<br/><br/>All of his military feats, brilliant political decisions, his amazing leadership and way of acquiring and holding the people he ruled's loyalty are reduced to just a bare mention by a distant Hopkins in the background along with an Indiana Jonish map, or to some speech or two where instead of showing the personality of the natural born leader he was, Alexander actually looks like a child in a tantrum that leaves us thinking how he could actually get at least a guard to pay attention to him.<br/><br/>He mentions and shows, time and again, how much he liked men, like saying ""hey audience, did you know Alex was gay?"".. then some Olympia's shot ""and he had some pretty nice traumas, too"".. and then again some Hephaiston and Alex scene so he could say ""but look, he was *really* gay!"" then the camera switches to some horses riding, some arguing with his officers, just to come back again to say ""but look, if you didn't believe me yet (cause I consulted some history experts!), now I'll show you his homosexuality even further with this gay dance and even more, you'll see his eyes pop outta his face when the dancer spreads right in front of him!!!""...<br/><br/>""Oh and by the way, yes he was in the military I think.. a general or something, here, look at him leading this 5 minute battle... sorry if the battle was sorta confusing, I left that part to my assistants, I had to be paying attention to some other scenes, lest the audience walks outta the theater without knowing Alexander the Great liked men..""<br/><br/>The movie says absolutely nothing/ barely mentions/ totally lies about:<br/><br/>-The Gordian Knot: Not only a tale, but something that actually happened, that would've shown more details about his personality than over 80% of the movie.<br/><br/>-The battle of the Granicus.<br/><br/>-The battle at the Pinarus.<br/><br/>-For God's sake, the conquest of Tyre!! Couldn't Stone have spared ourselves a bit of the sexual preferences/ family issues and showed instead at least 5 minutes of this mastermind designing not only this, but any other of his brilliant plans? Nah, don't say there's ""something"" before Gaugamela, cause that pathetic chessboard scene looks more like a mad scientist trying to convince his friends about something he just came up with than an already by then known military genius explaining the plan.<br/><br/>-Not so important, but definitely more important than some crap they left in: Darius mother, wife, and two daughters were taken prisoners after the battle at the Pinarus river, off of his camp. Not off of some Babylon's harem after Gaugamela.<br/><br/>-Alexander didn't meet Darius for the first time in Gaugamela, as the movie shows. Darius was present at the Granicus, and also according to Plutarch, he even fought hand to hand with him at the Pinarus battle. Darius also lost his chariot and bow there.<br/><br/>-Etc..<br/><br/>We're talking about some important details here, not just some nerdish nitpicking. This person conquered the whole known world by then, and that fact's barely mentioned in the movie. And it's not like there're so many Alexander movies out there in a way you could say: ""oh but wait, you don't understand, Stone wanted to portrait another side of Alexander with this one"".. If you advertise the movie saying you've been advised by experts and saying you're going to show the life of this genius in such a complete way as they did, you simply can't miss or ignore so many facts. Case anyone still needs a spoon-fed clarification, no, I don't have any problem with the director showing his sexuality neither with it, I just don't think it was needed to devote so much time to it. Anyone would've gotten the point with just a scene or two. He exaggerated so much with the time spent describing those things in a way that the character simply doesn't make anyone believe he could do what he did, nor can it consistently be seen.<br/><br/>Pretty much like doing a movie about Walt Disney, without saying how the hell did he come up with Mickey Mouse, or a movie about Christopher Columbus, where after three hours of describing what he liked for dinner, some voice in off says ""oh, and by the way, he discovered America""...<br/><br/>Props to Hopkins, however."

","To paraphrase the legendary critic Roger Ebert, some directors are so talented that their failures are often way more interesting than most directors' successes. He was speaking of David Lynch at the time, though I have no doubt that the names Welles and Coppola probably entered his mind as well.<br/><br/>We are in a fruitful year for movies, and for brave directors. This year has already added two names to Mr. Ebert's list above. Audiences did not see the brilliance of Kerry Conran's SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, nor do they seem to see what a special gift Robert Zemeckis has given us with THE POLAR EXPRESS. This is too bad. These films define the very reason why we should go to see movies in a theater rather than wait for the DVD. They take us out of our ordinary lives and in to fantastic worlds where we have never gone before. These films should be cherished for the gifts that they are.<br/><br/>Now, along comes a maverick director cut from the same cloth as Mr. Coppola.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone - no matter what you think of his politics - makes films that literally bounce of the screen and deserves to be added on to Mr. Eberts list. His films pulsate with energy and life that most films do not even come close to. His big five - JFK, WALL STREET, PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, NIXON - are like beating hearts taped to a white screen in front of us. Every ounce of his legendary energy is sprayed on the screen like so many bullets from SCARFACE (another Stone production, initially panned by critics yet adored by fans).<br/><br/>Now comes Alexander, and the director is showing no signs of letting up or slowing down. Is the film flawless? Far from. Is the film great? You bet. This is a film that refuses to be pinned down by critics. It is a film of awe-inspiring beauty and brutality. Does it have some accents that need improving? You bet. Mr. Kilmer and Ms. Jolie are both in need of some dialect coaching here. Is the script flawless? Nope. But add together all the great things about the film and subtract the bad, and the fact is that this is still one hell of an experience. Much has been made of the depiction of Alexander's sexuality in this film. Is he gay? Nope. He's bi if you ask me. Is there gay love in the film? Yup. Is there some gay sex between Colin Farrell and Jared Leto? Nope. (All gay sexual content is hinted at, which is a little surprising considering how much hoopla has been made about it in the press). Are there strong FEMALE leads in the film? Yes. Not one, but two as Rosario Dawson and Angelina Jolie play tug-of-war as to who should really walk away with the film. And finally, there is one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever put on film.<br/><br/>So the final question is, should you treat yourself and spend some bucks on this spectacle? Hell yes!"

","See, unlike maybe some other people, I liked the movie. Sure I'm not a good one to judge or say things about the movie but I know what I like when I see it. <br/><br/>I've always liked Greek and Roman history/culture so I liked the movie. I do believe that Oliver Stone has a weakness in the sexual ways but I'm not big on that. I guess this movie depends on how you like things. If you like action movies with war and some sexual content you might like this. But some other people who do not like drama and action with bloody scenes as much and do not approve of sexual content may not like it. <br/><br/>If I compare this movie to Troy I must say I like this one better. Troy may have made me cry a hell of a lot more but Alexander wasn't a topic that I really did my research on. It was new to me, unlike Troy, so I wasn't disappointed by how Alexander and Hephaistion loved each other. This movie just perked my curiosity. Of course, this is just my opinion and if you really want to know what the move is like, see for yourself. You can't always rely on comments because everyone has different tastes."
"eyes_blaze","10","8","16","26 November 2004"," Perfect.
","This is an intriguing and rather unusual retelling of the story of Alexander the Great. While his exploits have been chronicled many times, few movies have ever really tried to get inside the man's mind in the same way as this one. The result is at times speculative, so that the movie is more psychological melodrama than a simple narration of history.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the movie starts with the myths and legends that Alexander himself knew, and uses them to create a psychological portrait of a man who was undoubtedly complex. The Greek mythology is often about characters who are morally ambiguous, as Alexander himself was. <br/><br/>The result is a movie that is about being driven relentlessly by inner demons. Like his mythical predecessor, Achilles, Alexander chose a short and glorious life, but ultimately self-destructed. If this interpretation is speculative, it is interesting and insightful."

People left in the middle. Never in my life have I seen so many people leave during a movie. It was astonishingly tedious. The inane dialogue, the ridiculous sex scene between Alexander and Roxane.

I was happily surprised. This film is fantastic, a great epic. Its almost 3 hours fly by and if I had to find fault it was that in order to please audiences the film is about an hour or two too short. The acting is superb(Farrell and Jolie especially) and so is the story(with a character like Alexander there are so many different angles you can take!). Best of all is the battle of Gaugamela, which for me, is one of the most stunning battles scenes since Spartacus! Even if the rest of the film was rubbish(and its definitely not) I would recommend this film on the strength of that alone.

"waddingham","9","7","14","26 November 2004"," A well accomplished look at a complex man who changed history
","Producing an historical drama for an essentially ahistoric public is risky business. For years (in the US at least) historic dramas of ancient personages were mostly grade B romances. My favorite recollection of same was an old John Wayne movie in which he played, I think, Atilla the Hun. He looked at the leading lady and said, ""You sure are pretty when you're angry maam."" Sigh.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone does a commendable job of putting together the life of someone who made a sea change in western society and doing so in under three hours. No doubt some will carp that certain facts are open to interpretation (they always are) and that some were changed (the perennial difference between a drama and a documentary). Others will no doubt find themselves offended by Alexander's sexuality which does not fit at all conveniently into modern terms (bi -sexual, homosexual) but is a given for the time and is handled fairly and even comprehensively by Stone who does not give into the trap of using it to completely define Alexander.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell does a better job of portraying Alexander than I thought he would. He handles the part with the sort of passion that marks the ancient Greek world. A drunken Alexander could kill a man (Cleitus) who saved his life at Gaugamela and repent by trying to kill himself. He could also weep for a nearly a whole day over the body of Hephaestion until his personal guards pulled him off the body. The condensed nature of the epic almost makes Alexander appear mad but his military, administrative, and cultural genius show us a figure who is finally anything but mad.<br/><br/>I never found myself bored with the movie despite knowing the plot before hand - a fact that always puts the director of a well known epic at a disadvantage. The historical person Alexander gives lie to the adage that ""we all put our pants on one leg at a time."" Portraying such a character could easily move into caricature rather than characterization. Stone's directing and Ferrell's acting resist that.<br/><br/>We are constantly bombarded with movies in which cartoon characters come to life, trusted oldies are remade, and formula films are directed to specific market demographics like breakfast cereal to kids. How nice someone tackles one of the greatest figures of western history and actually pulls it off."

Stone tried so hard to win awards with this film that he didn't realize that people were getting bored. The movie was to long, Colin Farrell over acted the role to extremes, and Stone incorporated facts concerning Alexander's homosexuality. <br/><br/>However, experts cannot prove that Alexander was homosexual, all rumors of his sexuality surfaced several hundred years after he died.

But in the following days I found myself haunted by the tragic power of Colin Farrell's performance -- his and Stone's aim of presenting an Alexander who was ""greatly tormented"" (Farrell's words) being perfectly realised. But I cannot understand what is going on as far as reactions to this film are concerned. The attacks on it seem inexplicable. It may have flaws (it's a rare film that hasn't) and criticism is par for the course, but this film wasn't ""reviewed"" or ""criticised"" -- rather, US audiences and reviewers fell on it like a pack of wolves. WAS it homophobia? WAS it the Irish accents? (US audiences seem to think it reasonable that Stone should ask an Irish cast to ASSUME American accents to play Ancient Macedonians -- makes one think perhaps Stone's theme of xenophobia was timely . . .) WAS it just the usual bear-baiting inflicted on Oliver Stone? WAS it the political implications?

It simply blows me away that one single person could create such an enormous empire in just a few years. This movie portraits the quest correctly, but it misses key points, specially when it comes to Alex's character. Yes, Alexander was bisexual and possibly even more gay than straight, but it was custom at the time to have an homosexual relationship with a servant or a friend. Actually, if you occupied a strong ""political"" position this was somehow expected (almost demanded). Alexander was a ruthless enemy and a man of extremely strong character. Sure he had feelings like anyone else, but the film exaggerates when we see an Alexander being constantly overwhelmed by them. Also, Collin Farrel as a great conqueror? Come on, I like Farrel, but it's just not in him (at least not yet).<br/><br/>The momentum of the movie is just slow, like, turtle slow. Things don't happen quite as fast as they should. Alexander's life was fast! He lived short, fought hard and died great. Same thing should happen with the movie. Instead we are carried over through 3 hours of soap opera.

","""Every"" movie is a great movie when you watch it in Cinema. ""Alexander"" however wasn't good at all even though I've watched in cinema. The actors were at their worst - excluding Anthony Hopkins and Angelina Jolie. The movie music was horrible as well. The movie picture colors were blinding and made the movie so unbearable and at last the movie script was 'almost' ridiculous. It's a pity that I've found out that Oliver Stone is not as good as he has always been at directing movies. I bet his first movie was ten times better directed then ""Alexander"". After all, watching ""Alexander"" to me meant having the most boring 2 hours of my life - however this doesn't mean that You wont like it because everybody has different tastes so please watch it and judge it for yourselves."
"karagoz-emre","10","4","7","7 June 2017"," A well-done history masterpiece. 5.5 is an IMDb joke.
","I wanted to watch this movie for far too long but I always delayed it to watch other movies because there wasn't an incentive to watch it, 5.5 points on IMDb? really? <br/><br/>oh boy, i was so wrong.<br/><br/>This movie totally satisfied me, as i wasn't expecting much from it.<br/><br/>The story telling was great, I liked the switch between the past and the present(less past?) often. It really helped us to understand the character better.<br/><br/>In my defense, I was always interested in Alexander the Great but I never fully had to chance to know about him. This movie managed to overcome my hunger.<br/><br/>Same as during the battle scenes, it keeps us informed as ""macedonian right"" or ""macedonian center"" things like that. i wish all movies would do that so that i can grasp the battle really, totally in essence.<br/><br/>I'm trying to understand people's mindset about this. I guess maybe it came out in the same year with Troy in 2004. Troy was also about history but the battle scenes were soo much more quality than Alexander for sure. Maybe people were expecting to see something similar.<br/><br/>The character buildup is great, soon after i started to feel like i was there with Alexander or i felt like i was him, making the decisions and he always kept his calm and explained when he needed to. <br/><br/>Maybe we got the characters so well because the movie is pretty long. According to IMDb its 2:55 but i watched a version which it was even longer 3:33. But I never felt bored. This movie is a must for history lovers. If you are looking for glorious battle scenes you might not find them.<br/><br/>I'm a lover of maps and a sizable chunk of the movie passes on showing the maps during studies of young Alexander or in his chambers before battle and when the storyteller tells us. So it was not too much nor too less. Extremely adequate.<br/><br/>In papers English was written in Greek style which was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Music at the end (i knew it, but i didn't know the name so i shazamed it) was amazing (titans vangelis). It was a nice finishing touch for such a great movie.<br/><br/>Also I had to like the movie, even though i wouldn't have liked the movie in general out of respect to the amazing actors i know from various movies and series:<br/><br/>(i'll just type their names and most prominent acts in my eyes)<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins {Kidnapping Mr. Heineken, Noah, The Silence of the Lambs, Amistad}<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie {Salt, Wanted, Kung Fu Panda, Mr. & Mrs. Smith}<br/><br/>Val Kilmer {Hardwired, Felon, The Love Guru, Heat}<br/><br/>Christopher Plummer {Inside Man, Syriana, A Beautiful Mind, Twelve Monkeys}<br/><br/>Colin Farrell {True Detective, The Lobster, Seven Psychopaths, S.W.A.T., Hart's War, Tigerland}<br/><br/>Jared Leto {Suicide Squad, Mr. Nobody, Lord of War, Fight Club}<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers {From Paris with Love}<br/><br/>Rory McCann {Game of Thrones}<br/><br/>Toby Kebbell {Gold, Warcraft: The Beginning, Black Mirror, War Horse, The Veteran, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time}<br/><br/>Rosario Dawson {Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, Unstoppable, Seven Pounds, Clerks II, Sin City, 25th Hour}"
"erin1786","2","4","7","9 July 2007"," By the beard of Zeus, this is vile.
","In a word, this film is putrid. I spent most of the film making such horrified exclamations as ""No! No!"" and ""Oh dear God!"" I understand the great Hollywood epics of historical figures tend to ignore the concept of ""historically accurate,"" but this picture committed new leaps and bounds by ignoring logic and sanity. Now, mind you, this is an Oliver Stone film with millions of dollars behind it and an all-star cast. But big names and beacoup budgets do not a good movie make.<br/><br/>We begin in merry old emerald isle famous for beer, redheads, and a Blarney Stone. However, this picture decides to call this place ""Greece."" We are supposed to think nothing of those ancient Mediterranean's dropping a ""lad"" and ""arse"" on occasion. For some more fun, we throw in a few Brits and Americans. And as a real cherry topper, Angelina Jolie, perpetually youthful, comes in wearing a toga and sounding like a Russian mail order bride with an unexplained snake fetish. I presumed that as the film made its random time jumps Ms. Jolie might sport a gray hair or two. No such luck. Alexander, whether essayed by be- wigged young boys or Colin Farrell, prances about in a platinum blonde 1970's shag that would make Farrah Fawcett green with envy. And, of course, the rest of the Greeks must be cycloptic--to keep in with those myths, I suppose. Among the battle-scarred is Alexander's father, the king of Macedonia, who appears to be no more than the BC equivalent of a slovenly barfly. And shall we not forget the whole of the Persian empire and the fortune they have invested in eyeliner?<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>Alexander also holds the title for the most clichéd, banal, fist-eatingly horrendous dialogue, nearly all of which is relegated to ""profound"" statements. I can take a wise verse here and there, but to have entire conversations made up of trite aphorisms is absolutely ridiculous. To paraphrase: ""A man can achieve glory."" ""Yes, but to achieve his glory, he must suffer."" ""But in suffering, there is truth."" ""But in that truth there is a heavy price."" ""But with that heavy price comes greatness."" Repeat ad nauseum while staring off at nothing. Because we all walk around spouting off pithy sayings all the live long day. And then we cry. A lot.<br/><br/>For the battle scenes, Mr. Stone decided it would be fun to have a jerky, bloody, CGI madhouse in which I think he just blindly threw the cameras into and hoped for the best. Alexander rides around on his horse wearing a be-plumed helmet that in any sort of sane situation would have been a giant ""Here I am! Shoot me!"" target. Though heavily spattered with blood, he seems to escape any major injury, one of Darius's men (who looks as though he raided Ghegis Khan's wardrobe) following him and then...not, apparently. Quite honestly, it doesn't even matter by that point. There is no sense to this film. None whatsoever. It's a bit like someone's drug-induced nightmare...edited with a sledgehammer.<br/><br/>Truly painful."
"stringking","Null","7","15","7 December 2004"," I was so hopeful...(spoilers)
","When I first heard word that Oliver Stone was making 'Alexander', I was hopeful. When I saw the trailer, I was excited. Therefore, I was happy to give up my Thanksgiving night to go and see a great, great movie. What I got, however, was 'Alexander'.<br/><br/>Let's get the obvious out of the way. I know that bisexuality was widely accepted in Greek culture, as it is in this culture, but Colin Farrell and Jared Leto making googly eyes at each other made me wince. During the part where they are musing about how much they need each other, everyone in the theater shifted in their seats and coughed or cleared their throats. Yeah, it was that bad. The default reaction is to call me a homophobe--which is correct. But homophobe or not, any straight man would cringe at the the sight of that pretty boy dancer shaking his moneymaker. Moving on.<br/><br/>Now, if you were to take out all things gay about this movie, it would still be awful. At almost three hours it was like taking sleeping pills but having your little brother shake you every ten seconds. The dialogue is hammy, the acting is 'Days of Our Lives' caliber, and the two all too brief battle scenes in this hefty 180-minute chunk of slumber are really confusing and poorly filmed. Not to mention that Stone all of a sudden decides to invite the 60's over in the last battle sequence. Angelina Jolie's accent, as well as Rosario Dawson's, was mind-numbing. I expected her to spew insults at a moose and squirrel at any moment.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the only redeeming quality about this flick was the hot-despite-Boris-and-Natasha-accent Angelina Jolie. That is, until they painted the varicose veins on her face. Woof.<br/><br/>So, bottom line, 'Alexander' a 3 out of 10. Go and see 'the Incredibles'. Please."
"verbernarcae","10","12","30","11 February 2005"," Great Movie for Intelligent Peoples and not for the American Viewers!
","Vast, riveting, madly audacious movie biography. It's boldly acted, absorbing and satisfying as a history lesson and chock-full of extravagantly brutal battle sequences. Unwieldy and flawed, but Stone remains a tornado in an era of airless formula and -- to paraphrase our Ptolemy -- its failings are greater than most films' successes. As one of the few movies around not pushing state-of-the-art animation or Jude Law, Alexander is a damn good date movie. Makes for a long, lumpy trip with a charismatic guide and some brilliant detours. Stone's films thrive on controversy and a lot of his films exist just because Stone wants to make people think and analyze the stories and tales they think they know about a subject. Every one of Stone's more high-profile and successful films have ignited a debate somewhere. This is also true about his Greek epic, ""Alexander"". The best there is to say is that it's better than ''Troy''. At least Stone's movie does not employ a hypocritical presentation of Alexander as Troy did trying to disguise the love between Patroclus and Aquiles as a cousin-cousin relationship. The Greeks of the 4th century BC apparently felt the same way as the real Alexander did concerning homosexuality, and Alexander was simply a product of his times in this regard, no more or less. That he was bisexual is incidental. Who he connected with, and why, is far more significant in the telling of his tale, and to my mind Stone did an excellent job of separating the important from the unimportant here. Of course, the on-screen violence was graphic, as befitted the violent nature of those times, and there was simply too much of it in Alexander's life to show it all, but I think Stone put a human face on a larger than life persona in an admirable way and successfully avoided many of the excesses a film of this magnitude would easily be prone to. ""Alexander"" is the height of artistic direction in my view."
"Derek237","7","5","10","27 September 2005"," Fortune did not favor Stone's bold film
","When Alexander was released on DVD, I was reminded of a joke Billy Crytal made when he hosted the Oscars: ""A new director's cut of 'Gigli' will be released which will run 2 hours shorter."" Audiences have the option of viewing the original theatrical cut of Alexander, and a new director's cut that is actually 8 minutes shorter. I have seen both versions, and there's not really much of a difference. Stone tones down some of the gay undertones in the director's cut, conforming to many criticisms. He also evens out the flashbacks a bit, which I think works better. It doesn't really matter which version you watch, if you don't like one you won't like the other, simple as that. Honestly, I only bought the director's cut because the entire movie fits on one disc. I liked Alexander, and it was by no means a bad movie.<br/><br/>Stone explores Alexander The Great's personal life more than his battle tactics, which many believed to be a bad move. In a way, it was. Anyone who views the film alone would probably never get a grasp of what a brilliant mind he actually was. What I thought was very interesting though, was Alexander's unquenchable thirst to conquer new worlds, to push further, until it inevitably destroyed him. Ironically not dying in a battle, but in his bed, taken ill by bad water. So what drove Alexander? Was it to desperately win approval from his parents? Stone's vision seems to think this played a big part. While all the elements come together to make Alexander far more emotionally vulnerable than say, Maximus from Gladiator or Spartacus from...Spartacus, we're given an unexpected new kind of historical epic protagonist. I guess some people just didn't want to accept it, or maybe weren't ready for it.<br/><br/>Alexander was not a bad movie. It is at times a little misguided, and there are some aspects that just didn't fly too well, but overall it was very good. Stone has given us a unique look at one of history's greatest figures. It did not do well financially, and some of its critics were absolutely merciless, but you'll never know until you judge it for yourself. <br/><br/>My rating: 7/10"
"AZGrooveGuy","2","5","10","4 August 2005"," What a joke!
","There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said a million times over, considering there are now over 90 pages of reviews of 'Alexander'. However, since I lost three hours of life watching this, I feel compelled to add my two cents.<br/><br/>I am a lover of film, both bad and good. I had heard the bad reviews of this film, but was curious to see this based on the 'bisexual' controversy, not to mention it being helmed by Mr. Stone....how bad could it be? I think a precedent has been set in the bad movie pantheon. And not bad movie as in 'Showgirls', but bad movie as in 'The Postman'.<br/><br/>My complaints are the same as the others I have read....<br/><br/>1. The casting agent should never be allowed to cast another movie EVER. Angelina Jolie as Colin Farrell's mother and sharing scenes with the adult Alexander...who's bright idea was it to cast two actors of the same age as parent and child? The last time we saw this was in 1974's 'Earthquake', when Lorne Greene tried to pass as Ava Gardner's father. This was so much worse. The CGI crows feet and veins on Ms. Jolie's face did not work.<br/><br/>2. Colin Farrell's horrendously bad bleached blonde mullet wig, was Alexander also a fan of bad 80's hair metal bands?? Distracting is too tame a word for his hair do, it should have also had top billing. His character would have looked more at home with a 'Ratt' or 'Skid Row' sleeveless T-shirt on than the little leather mini skirts he kept sporting.<br/><br/>3. Angelina Jolie's hilarious Vampira accent made me wonder how many takes it took for the crew to stop cracking up when they filmed the scenes....everyone I watched it with laughed and laughed at every word she spoke. I blame this not on Jolie, but on Stone's lack of common sense when directing her.<br/><br/>4. The oft mentioned sex scene with Farrell and Rosario Dawson...if Farrell is ever 'roasted' in later life, this is certainly the scene that will be shown to humiliate him. Was he channeling a lion? An alley cat in heat? It has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>5. While I give Mr. Stone a lot of credit for including the bisexual aspect to the story, the scenes were uninspired. Jared Leto had more make up on than most of the women, and looked like he was ready to go to a Depeche Mode concert circa 1982, crimped hair and all. I would have preferred one kickarse roll in the hay scene with Farrell and Leto rather than the shots of them staring at each other over and over and over. Also, why did the 'gay' men all look like women? <br/><br/>6. A movie about Greeks with no actual Greeks in the cast? There were so many accents from all nations, I got confused and thought perhaps this was the Olympic games. Why not hire a credible Greek cast to AT LEAST fill in the supporting roles. A Greek historical figure with an Irish Americanaccent, how did Mr. Stone ever sell this to the studio? <br/><br/>7. The battle scenes, what happened there? While it certainly upped the gore quotient, who cares when you can't tell who is doing what to who? And why not have some discussion as to the strategies involved in winning the battles, is that too much to ask? <br/><br/>8. Was it really necessary to make the male child actors wear lipstick? <br/><br/>9. The music, a new low. It was all Hollywood spectacle music, and did not follow the plot in the least. Very generic and sweeping and lots of harps, I can't tell you how many times the group I watched this with rolled their eyes and discussed how bad the music was.<br/><br/>10. Alexander's war helmet, what was that all about? It was gold and seemed to have additional room to allow his mullet to breathe, it was out of a bad 50's sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>It's a punch in the gut to realize many of these actors all made millions of dollars to be in this movie.<br/><br/>I gave it two stars for Colin Farrell's nude scene, which unfortunately is the only good thing I got from the film. I would have preferred to see those five seconds and just get the rest of my life back that I lost to this movie."
"Stevelabarber","1","5","10","3 June 2005"," One of the worst films ever made
","What was Oliver thinking? An interpretation of Alexanders life is not what we were looking for. The move focuses on Alexander being Bi-sexual. they're supposed to be Greek? Colin Farrel's accent in this movie is clearly Irish. Angelina Jolie (Alexanders mother ???) has a German accent. The movie is not historically accurate, the battle scenes are too confusing. The camera is shaking around and it's all blurry. They say, ""It adds to the realism and intensity of warfare"" while really it's just an excuse for poor visual effects. There is also too much dialogue(not that good I might add) and the movie is like 3 hours long. There are only two battle scenes in the whole movie. They make it out to be an action movie which it hardly is. The only thing that was good in the movie was Val Kilmer."
"alinyunt","1","5","10","17 May 2005"," Stinkfest to the MAX
","This is close to being the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not quite sure whether it was worse than Battlefield Earth. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to the scenes they showed and those that were merely narrated by Hopkins; for most of the time it seemed like an over glorified documentary because of the awkward narration given my Ptolemy. When something finally wasn't arbitrarily skipped over by the filmmakers, the ensuing battle scene was so boring and drawn out I fell asleep. The casting was questionable-I didn't really understand the selection of Rosario Dawson as Roxanna (she's fine as an actress but wasn't she Eastern, even ""Caucasian"", not African). Also, Angelina Jolie's lack of aging for the ENTIRE film, and her Russian accent were terrible. I hated it. Its only value is as a film so bad that its worth seeing again to laugh at. So unless you get your jollies from other people's failure (like I do) avoid this film on video if you can."
"Frosteed","7","5","10","31 January 2005"," rise and fall of Alexander the great...330BC
","despite all the bad critics, the movie, seen on wide screen with 5.1 is really worth the go. Most historical elements have been truly kept, apart from Alexander's take of Persia (his main goal historically) which was disappointing. Few big battles (alexander only had to fight 7 in his whole reign, won 6), with a very exciting Gaugamela against Darius. The strongest point of the film being its full harmony with the special effects and synthetic images. Darius's palace of Babylon (all in blue tiles like it is historically known) is somptuous, as well as all the other palaces and landscapes, very thoroughly reproduced. great entertainment, good acting, a most beautiful Anjelina Jolie, a convincing Anthony Hopkins as Ptoleme and Colin Farrell quite in tune with his portrayal of Alexander. His beauty, his power, his thirst, his ambition, and also maybe his folly. If you can take 3h of your time, go see it, it really is worth it."

","This film was made with a ridiculously large budget that could have been put to better use in finding a cure for stupidity.

He is so clearly out of his depth in this genre and style. I can't express my dislike for this film enough. I hope to never see it again!<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has said that Alexander did not do well at the Box office in America because the film is too intelligent for the average cinema goer, he expects it to do well internationally because the audiences are apparently smarter. Well... I am smart, I am not American and I can put the poor box office performance down to one thing... IT IS A BAD FILM! People don't like it because there is nothing to like in it."

I guess I will give this film a one rating because they do not have zero or negatives.<br/><br/>I wonder what they must have thought when the makers of this film actually viewed it for the first time. I mean think of what can be done in these times with $180,000,000. The good thing about the movie is that Alexander the Great did not live to see this movie made.<br/><br/>They must have thought that will make the scenes as grand as possible.

"boythanh","Null","5","10","1 December 2004"," One of the best movie's i've seen so far....
","Hello there.<br/><br/>I am not normally commenting on movies i have watched, even if i am deeply touched by the movie. I saw ""Twister"" four times, Titanic four times as well (and own the DVD)and now there was ""Alexander"". I watched it when i returned from a stressy visa-run to the camboadian border, being quite tired upon return to Bangkok and my boyfriend (yes i am gay, 29 years old caucasian btw with thai boyfriend) asked me if i want to watch ""Alexander"". No problem. I had no clue about how long it would go, so i got the tickets while waiting for him to show up.<br/><br/>After about 10 Minutes i was glued to the story. To your info, i am not a fan of ""historic"" movies in general (no i have NOT seen ""Troy""), but here was a movie with a somewhat ""gay"" content, and that alone kept me interested. Now, i watched.<br/><br/>The picture was just great, i loved it! I did only once, at the scene with the ""eagle's view of the battle"", detect obvious signs of computer animation, the rest of the movie was just great filmed. Sure, i also tought ""why do they have these irish accents"" except Alexander's wife who i think spoke with Russian accent. Funny. I was totally kept with the love story between Alexander, Hephaistion and (after the battle of Babylon) Bagoas, whom i personally admire very much. So from my point of view, i have been watching a love story, or ""love drama"" (excuse me i am not a native English speaker, so i may use wrong words). And this love story to me was the best one i have ever seen. It was a ""gay"" love story, yes, but not overdone, and it makes me wish to turn back the time for some 2.300 years and let me live in a time where i can be just ""me"", not having to be branded ""gay"" for loving my boyfriend. True at that time it was just normal, and nobody gave a damn if you loved men or women, or both.<br/><br/>After the movie was over i sat for a little while, thinking, letting it ""re-run"" in my head. And since i spent countless hours on the internet to dig REALLY deep into the history and the background, and ki think that even from a historical view, this movie is just great because it tells the story as true as it is. I have since watched ""Alexander"" a second time and next weekend i will go again. I am sort of in love with ""Bagoas"", played by Francisco Bosch. His tragic story would deserve a movie on it's own, and i am about to get a book about his live with Alexander. <br/><br/>I give ""Alexander"" a ""10"" rating, my reason is that the story was delivered in full truth, excellent photography and handling of a sensible subject in perfect way. Now i can't wait for the director's cut DVD to become available, i hope it will include a scene involving Bagoas which was cut in the cinema version.<br/><br/>Kind regards from a German guy in Bangkok<br/><br/>Thanh"
"IAmIdiotCentral","1","5","10","4 December 2004"," And you thought Troy was bad...
","After going through an experience like Alexander's three hours of ineptitude, a kind of mutual appreciation for surviving such rubbish. one does at least feel a kinship and bond with your fellow viewers. The most overwhelming emotion felt as the end credits run was like that of a trapped animal suddenly released into freedom. While Stone may seriously consider himself a dramatic historian with a gift for exploring avenues and angles on stories never considered, he is in fact more like a child who can't be bothered to read up on the subject and instead simply make the film he wants no matter what. Of course, this is all forgivable if the film were in any way entertaining or well acted. This is neither. It lurches lazily from one dire scene to the next like a badly rehearsed pantomime. Farrel is woefully miscast, Jolie's accent (one of the better ones!) is bizarre, and Tony Hopkins turns up for a quick earner at the beginning and end.<br/><br/>The most pathetic of all aspects though is the end. After all this dramatic recreation of possible events, Tony Hopkins character says something along the lines of ""of course, this could all be a load of tummyrubbish"". Oh nice one Tony, thanks!<br/><br/>If you thought Troy was bad (and you were right) then this will amaze you. It is in fact worse. From the Doors to Alexander. Stay away from history Oliver."
"Phoenix1982","4","5","10","24 November 2004"," Miracle child
","Good morning, here is your captain with no name speaking. Folks, this is official. People have proved they are in need of a serious intellect injection.<br/><br/>Let me start with the following: Gladiator (for some reasons often compared to ""Alexander"") was one of the most undeserving and generic movies of the year 2000, in every way possible inferior to ""Crouching Tiger"", which should have received that danged Oscar in the first place. In fact, so generic that this summer's ""Troy"" (another generic historical film, yet lively enough) is more deserving of the mentioned award.<br/><br/>It should, therefore, come as no surprise that most people just won't get what our ""Alexander"" is all about. A ""sandals and sword epic""? Forgive me Mr. Ebert if I applaud Oliver Stone's refusal to make a ""Gladiator 2"", with Alexander the Great dying in the age of 60, having what, conquered much of the known world? Or dying in the battlefield, with his noble warriors surrounding him? But people, that's just not what great victories are made of. Truly Sting was right, singing ""history will teach us nothing"".<br/><br/>""Alexander"" is a film about a great dreamer (all great warriors are), shaped by other people's (in this case, his mother's) dreams, ever fighting his fears and a possibility of falling short of the history's expectations. Watch closely people, here is your hero - conquering much of the known world, only to die misunderstood and blissfully unaware of the fact that the known world has a nasty habit of falling apart, Oliver Stones seems to tell us with his ""Alexander"".<br/><br/>He also seems to tell us that the way we are brought up already makes us marionettes in history's great dark hall of fame. He seems to remind us that our dreams are worthy of being pursued only as long as one realizes that the dreams always remain such. He seems to warn us that somewhere along the way everyone encounters a rusty ""stop"" sign, and that passing it by means to pass by one's happiness, in other words, is the beginning of the actual defeat.<br/><br/>Oh well. Cut to the chase, shall we. Many reviewers have mentioned the supposedly bad quality of the battle scenes. All I have to say is, don't watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" then. It doesn't get more real than that. Or than Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"". I love ""Troy"", but if we're talking historicity, I could honestly care less about Brad Pitt singlehandedly taking on a dozen of Trojans on that beach.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have mentioned the ""eagle shot"" interrupting Alexander's pre-battle speech, as annoying. Just another example of Oliver Stone's genius here. Instead of (indeed) feeding us another sappy speech, the director makes Alexander's voice fade and elevates the viewers above the soon-to-be battlefield, letting the viewers feel the momentariness of the change at hand. Throughout the movie I've felt that the eagle actually symbolizes Alexander's dreams, ever culminating in death - both at Gaugamela and in India, and, of course, on his deathbed. Any viewer who's loved Zemekis's ""feather flight"" in ""Polar Express"" will appreciate Oliver's eagle. It's so genius, it is impossible not to appreciate. It's postmodern.<br/><br/>All of the actors did a great job. Angelina Jolie's accent is fake and really funny, okay, so what? She does a surprisingly great job in her role (and that from a person who loathes ""Tomb Raider"").<br/><br/>Colin Farrel is wonderful as Alexander. Don't listen to the nay-sayers who will giggle at his, indeed, occasionally awkward attempts to portray a bisexual person. Anyone who deems his performance to be worse than that of Russel Crowe's in ""Gladiator"" is likely to have their eyes torn out and used as plugs in a, hmm, rather dark and uninteresting place.<br/><br/>And just what's up with Anthony Hopkins's spoken intro and interludes? Oliver Stone probably knew a whole lot of people with low intellectual demands would make even less sense of what was going on in his movie without an interpreter at hand.<br/><br/>Which reminds me, people have complained at the movie zipping back and forth in time - well it does ONCE folks. Once. And it does in the right place, namely when Alexander remembers just what has brought him to India. I will say no more, but it is really not THAT hard to figure out.<br/><br/>Okay, let's take on the floppy breasts kiddies. Just so you guys know, I'm not a gay. And this movie has done nothing to alter my conviction. NOTHING. In other words, ""Alexander"" has not made me shed a single tear over gay lovers. That being said, it has not made me shed a single tear over ""regular"" lovers either. It just isn't a movie about lovers... of any sort. Get it? It is a historical movie, and we all know that women in ancient Greece were considered a lower cast, in other words, not good enough to fall in love with. Or do we not? May I ask you where did you study your history, then? What Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" does, is, in fact, ignore the historical context. So save those comments, will ya?<br/><br/>Summing it all up, I must admit that I haven't seen a more intelligent historical movie lately. In fact, ""Gladiator"" is to ""Alexander"" as ""Die another day"" is to ""Bourne Identity"". If that's saying anything, of course.<br/><br/>Peace out people. God bless ya, and before you judge a wonderful movie by what others have said, go see it first. ""Alexander"" is all about powerful dreamers and their place in history's hall of fame. It is also about what we can learn for our lives, and the high expectations we normally have for ourselves and our ""miracle"" children (yes, Alexander was a miracle child). If you're an intelligent person you cannot possibly regret spending those 5 bucks on this film.<br/><br/>Enjoy.<br/><br/>~O~"

","I thought that this was a terrible movie. What really spoilt it for me was that many of the voice-overs by Sir Anthony Hopkins were not clearly audible because the music soundtrack was too loud. There was also too much talking and not nearly enough action. Also 3 hours was much too excessive, this movie could easily have been over in 90 or 120 minutes. This film was not an action movie it was basically a very uninteresting history lesson, and even at that who knows how much of it actually was historical fact and how much of it was just Hollywood fiction. It also disturbed me that Colin Farrell was only supposed to be 19 at one stage and Angelina Jolie was supposed to be his mother. Give it a miss, you really aren't missing much!!!!!"
"sinnerofcinema","10","6","13","26 November 2004"," VERY GOOD FILM, BUT NOT BOLD ENOUGH, I WOULD Definitely RECOMMEND
","I saw this film on thanksgiving. I really liked many elements about the film. However, I can see what people are saying about the accents. Practically for the first quarter, I had to try to figure out or ask my friend what the characters were saying. They were laying on the accents so heavy, and by the way they did soung all like irish accents, that well what can I say. With the withholding of emotion between Alexander and his ""lover"", I believe that might have created a detachment from the viewers perspective. I you want to indulge into his sexuality... THEN DO IT, don't play with the audience or better yet do go puritanical after choosing to focus on the sexuality and male to male relationship of the characters. I'm sure the did a lot more tan just embrace. Pushing an Agenda as others say... why not, but If you are going to go there, be like President Bush, determined and resolved to dig into his homosexual side, which we all got by the beginning what he had going on. <br/><br/>The film however was BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED AND PHOTOGRAPHED. I'm not sure about Colin in the lead for this film, but he seemed to be more comfortable in his role in the second half of the film. Also, the film could have been trimmed a good half hour. After a while, I started to look at my watch (which is not a good sign) in as much as I was gripped into the story. I'm sorry we live in time were Mr. Stone or the studios executives might have failed in fully doing what they seem they were set out to do off the back which is to tell the story of the Great Alexander as well as his personal romantic interludes. However, I commend all of the people who helped to bring this project to fruition. I understand how hard it is to put a film together, whether its 100,000 or 200 million. Great effort!"
"edasilvaneto08","10","6","13","27 November 2004"," Too artistic for Hollywood?
","I will break my comments down to two parts. First one for those who haven't seen the movie, followed by one for those who have seen.<br/><br/>First do not expect this movie to an epic. It is NOT. And in a certain sense we haven't had epics in a long time (despite what the critics say about Gladiator or Troy). Alexander's life was complex, as is the life of any individual. Telling Alexander's story is even more complex because we only know his life from History books. It is not like we could trace his mother and have her crying in sixty minutes. So in this way Oliver Stone's task was a difficult one. But Oliver Stone doesn't take the easy way. He decides to make a movie the is not about Alexander the man, it is a movie about Alexander the Myth. I can't go into detail, in this first part because it contains spoilers. This movie certainly doesn't have a traditional three acts screenplay. Maybe that is why this movie averages almost ten for people between ages 15 to 30 and so low for older people. It is not the plot line people expected to see either. It is about a great general, being bold and decisive like in Patton, or Gladiator. It is not about people fighting for their survival against evil. (By the way I have some problems with people calling TLOTR an epic). The flow of the movie isn't a consistent one, it alternates, going five years later, ten years back, whatever Oliver Stone feels good about it. I don't know what all this criticism about the flow is. Remember that before Oliver Stone directed his movies he was just a screenwriter, and he won a best screenplay academy award. So the critics should at least reflect a little bit and conclude that Oliver Stone is trying to say something with that. After all, Cinema is an art form that communicates what the creator wants to say in many various forms, not only words. For those who haven't seen it I say that you should be careful. Go to the movies not trying to see what YOU want to see, but trying to understand what OLIVER STONE is trying to say. So if you just sit back and relax, you might get a lot of interesting ideas and a really good plot.<br/><br/>Second Part - SPOILERS -<br/><br/>I guess that what many people didn't get is that we only know Alexander from history books. So it is more than acceptable that we listen to a story told by someone close to him, Ptolemy. By the way, Hopkins delivers another good performance. And so we see Alexander growing up, what kind of teachings he got from his mother, the idea that he was the sun of the gods, Aristotle lectures and his father's teachings. We then see all his ideas about greatness going into action, and how those reflect on his character. Does he get more self centered or was he that way all the time. It seems that Alexander is not a King that cares about his people, except when he needs them to fight. Note that he only gives his soldiers something when they complaint about it to him. Colin Farrell delivers the greatest performance of the year when he shows us a complex Alexander. We look at him and in the same scene we can see Alexander afraid, courageous, destined to greatness, and self absorbed. It was truly amazing how he could deliver all those emotions, changing his Alexander within the same scene. People got a little bit confused when late in the movie we flash back to see Philip's assassination. (great performance by Val Kilmer). But Stone was trying to make a parallel about Philip's death and Alexander the King that pushed it to the limit and killed the only man his father could trust. And it comes to an Alexander that couldn't hold himself together because he didn't know if he even deserved to be there. That's what Stone was trying, at least the way I understood. And with Alexander's terrible wound in India and his decision to go back home it is like he was dead already. After all Alexander was just a dream and once the dream is dead, there isn't much left. So in the last scene Ptolemy says they hated him so much that they killed Alexander, but right after that he corrects himself saying that it was just an old man talking. That is Oliver Stone way of saying that Alexander was just a man, who had many flaws and made many mistakes, but the legend, the myth of Alexander, the dream of power and unity for the whole world, that's what is important, that's what echoes through the history books, and that is Alexander.<br/><br/>So maybe next time Oliver Stone should just make Anthony Hopkins say exactly what he wants to say because using the many interesting aspects of cinema has become too difficult for the minds of moviegoers who expect information to be told. And if you are required to think, well, let's just say it's a bad movie. And in a few years, we can look to the world and whatever wars might be going on and say... hey, where is Maximus to save us?"

","I saw this movie and was amazed by the sheer perfection that went into it. The movie was length but worth every minute. I believe this is one of Colin Farrells greatest roles to date, Colin acted brilliantly. I also believe other characters that were great are Angelina Jolie who plays Alexanders mother even though the ages are close she seems as his mother, Jared Leto played who plays alexanders lover was absoulutly magnificent, and Anthony Hopkins played older Ptolmery, he was a great narrator and showed much feeling through his voice. One of Oliver Stones greatest works. Don't believe the negative critics it is truly a great movie. Its a must-see movie!"

","I really liked this movie. It drew me in and spun a world for me. I love Alexander and Hephaiston. I think they might be one of the greatest couples of all time. <br/><br/>The movie was beautiful, if a bit bloody in the battles. The female characters were strong, not fainting violet females. <br/><br/>Homosexuality was not an issue at that time in our culture and it is shown so very openly and elegantly. At one point in the movie, Alexander celebrates by giving dowries to all of the unmarried women with the army, all of them, and one of his men shouts out, ""And what about the boyfriends!""<br/><br/>I highly recommend you see it.<br/><br/>Nix"
"yaletown2004","10","6","13","25 November 2004"," Entertaining & eye-opening extravaganza
","I really enjoyed Alexander, and I am fed up with the negative reviews others are giving it. 90% of the complaints seem to be based on homophobia. If you didn't know Alexander preferred men to women beforehand, then you are seriously ignorant of history and need to pick up some books instead of going to the cinema. Some typical complaints I have read on these comment boards are : ""Who was the character Anthony Hopkins played?"" and ""Why did he wear a mullet?"" These comments just prove the dumbing down of America is complete. For your information..Hopkins played Ptolemy, who accompanied Alexander through his conquests, and appeared in his younger form throughout the film. Oliver Stone has made a great film, and all complaints I have read are based on sheer stupidity."
"nym-5","10","6","13","23 November 2004"," Glory to the Great.
","All hail Oliver Stone, whose Alexander is a shock: not a campy disaster. And believe me, when you've got Angelina Jolie playing Alexander the Great's mother as a snake-loving harpy, when you've cast Val Kilmer as a one-eyed nightmare of a daddy-king, when you've dusted off Chariots of Fire's Vangelis for your conquering-the-world soundtrack music, you are courting disaster, brother. <br/><br/>But Stone rises to his own challenge. He stages Alexander's numerous bloody, profitable coups with a scary fury that never boils over into Natural Born Killers psycho-territory. And in Colin Farrell, he has an Alexander not only of finely dyed blond hair (a far more convincing do than Richard Burton's daffodil-colored bob in the 1956 thudder Alexander the Great) but also of finely calibrated emotions. It's really difficult to emote while bellowing inspirational commands to what look like thousands of massed Macedonian warriors. It's just as difficult to be an Alexander who can gaze into the eye-liner-rimmed baby-brown eyes of his lifelong friend, Hephaestion (Jared Leto), and not go all weak in the toga-exposing knees (even the mighty Claire Danes couldn't resist when Leto was Jordan Catalano in My So-Called Life). <br/><br/>Stone handles Alexander's well-documented bisexuality without the kind of macho contempt you might expect from the popular image of this ballsy director. Indeed, Stone does what other battle-smitten directors from Sam Fuller to John Milius haven't been able to do: convey the crackle of homo eroticism of men in groups with a casual frankness.<br/><br/>And I haven't even mentioned the elephants. Near the end of the film, in India, Alexander and his now-bedraggled crew are set upon by invaders mounted on elephants, animals that scare the bejesus out of the Greeks and their horses. At first, all you hear in the dense Indian forest are thundering, camera-rattling thumps-it's a little Jurassic Parky-but when the elephants emerge and charge, prepare to be awestruck.<br/><br/>I doubt there's much of an audience out there for a two-and-a-half-hours-plus ancient-Greek epic these days. But Stone has done an honorable, honest job here; he obviously commands loyalty among his former troops, since Kilmer (The Doors) and Hopkins (Nixon) took a flier on a very risky project. And Stone didn't lose that edge of just-around- the-next-frame looniness we love him for: Alexander goes to take a gulp of wine, for instance, and floating in his chalice is a shimmering image of Jolie as a snake-haired Medusa-mom. As one of the few movies around not pushing state-of-the-art animation or Jude Law, Alexander is a damn good date movie, especially if the person you're dating has either an inexorable will-to-power or enjoys panting."
"adrianashum","10","8","19","18 January 2005"," Eyes closed against the Macedonian sun
","Oliver Stone has risen admirably to the challenge of making a film about one of ancient history's most dazzling figures. Making a successful film about an historical figure is always difficult as few lives follow plots that make good box-office. One can either 'rewrite history' in order to make the storyline follow that which audiences will find satisfactory (which can still be controversial, if you think of 'A Beautiful Mind') or, as Oliver Stone has done with 'Alexander', take the more accurate course with some thoughtful editing to keep the story within a reasonable running time.<br/><br/>Unlike the Biblical epics where most people in the audience have some background knowledge of what to expect, the life of Alexander is better known to academics than to the man in the street. Alexander may have lived and died more than 2 300 years ago, but his life was remarkably well documented and there are few serious anachronisms or factual errors in this film, only compromises. Some of the dialogue is verbatim translation of what was transcribed by Ptolemy and Arrian. For anyone who has not had the benefit of a classical education, this is a film where it pays to do some homework before hand, even if it is only a copy of Mary Renault's 'The Nature of Alexander' from the local library.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the reviewers - a large number reveal exceptional ignorance and even more reveal a fear to express an opinion of their own.<br/><br/>There have been adverse comments about Colin Farrell's Irish accent. Would it have been more appropriate if he spoke with an American one? Or a camp Greek one? The Macedonians spoke a different language to the Hellenes and the Irish accent is as appropriate an equivalent as an English one would be for the Hellenes. As for his mother, Olympias, she was a Slav and her Slavic accent is appropriate. An advantage of choosing an actor like Farrell to play 'Alexander' is that his face is relatively unknown and images of him in other roles do not spring to mind to blur the picture.<br/><br/>Go and see this film with an open mind. Don't compare it to 'Gladiator' which is a fictitious tale in an historic time or 'Troy' which is an Homeric epic and has little fact to back it up apart from Schlieman's excavations. And do not judge Alexander's actions more than two thousand years ago against the morals and manners of today."
"alex-1016","8","7","16","16 January 2005"," If you like historical epics, you'll like it, if not, then avoid
","I enjoyed this film. Most of it seemed reasonably accurate and the battle scenes are very good. Hopkin's narration is a useful and necessary. You may be confused why all the Macedonians have Irish accents, and the other Greeks have 'English' accents - it is to portray the fact that although the Macedonians spoke Greek, they weren't total Greek in terms of ethnicity and history. This device can be confusing at first, but it does make some sense. <br/><br/>If you like historical epics (e.g. Spartacus, War and Peace etc) you like this. If you are interested in Alexander the great, you'll also probably like this. If your favourite movie is 2Fast2Furious, its probably not your cup of tea. If you can't accept the fact that Alexander was bisexual, then a: get a life, its fact, b: go watch top gun instead :-)"

","Colin deserves to win the best actor Oscar, and it would be a crime if he just got a nomination. Angelina also deserves an Oscar, and the rest of the cast does great too. The story, well its one of the greatest stories ever, is well told, and for those complaining its hard to follow because of the narration, lets not forget Stone is compressing an entire life into 3 hours so pay attention and you will understand, I know its hard for all you MTV brainwashed losers and ignorant people to focus after getting used to all those pointless comedies, but movies like this deserve your attention, and since Stone is the master of intensity, he makes it easy with great acting, camera work and masterful directing, all I know is my eyes were glued to the screen, every second was brilliant. Its powerfully dramatic and intelligent, it also offers 2 great battles which are realistic, bloody, and long, but like I said there are only 2, it could have used at least 1 more with a one on one fight just to show how skilled Alex was in combat, perhaps the relationship between Roxanne and him could have been removed because it really isn't important, and a battle could have taken its place. Also don't listen to Ebert about this movie, he complains that there isn't enough between Alex and Hep, and too much between Roxanne and Alex, that is not true, the only real love relationship in the movie is Alex and Hep, Roxanne is there only to show us her breasts ""not that I'm complaining"" but I guess Stone didn't want to show the other kind of love scene, thank god, I don't mind the mention of being gay, but I don't ever want to see, well you know what, also if you don't like the movie because there is gay people in it, you dislike the movie for a false reason, the movie doesn't address the fact that Alex was bisexual, it talks about the bond that forms between 2 men who have lived, fought, and would die together, not liking this movie because of that fact is like saying you don't love someone you've known your entire life, and would mutually die for one another, I would say I loved someone who would die for me, I wouldn't sleep with them, but maybe thats why Stone didn't show that. In closing this movie is definitely a leading contender for many Oscars, and should definitely win best actor, picture, director, and actress, I give it a 10 out of a 10, it would be as good as Gladiator if it had more action."

","I don't care what anyone says - I Loved this Movie!. Any film that has me running to the internet to check out the ""real facts"" behind the plot has got to be great. I'm sure Oliver Stone took liberties , but what director doesn't? I knew the story of poor Alexander the Great, who died mysteriously at a young age in his 30's after conquering the known world. People are still talking about what really killed him. This film brought that entire period of history to life for me and made me want to learn more. Visually, its stunning. Beautiful costumes, battle scenes, gorgeous guys (and girls)! I've watched this film multiple times and I get something more each time I see it. Val Kiler and Angelina Jolie are wonderful as Alexander's parents (although Alexander claims to be the son of Zeus). Alexander's close friends and army comrades are also terrific (Jared Leto, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, etc.) Colin Farrell is simply gorgeous as Alexander - no other actor could have done better.<br/><br/>Perhaps this film was poorly received by critics and some viewers because it is melodramatic, more theatrical or operatic than we are used to seeing in this day and age. But the subject matter cries out for melodrama for goodness sakes! A young man conquered the known world at age 25 and kept going until he died a few years later. What a story - what a movie!"

He is totally unbelievable as the commander of men and armies and seems to spend the whole film with terrified looking expressions on his face leading seemingly aimless charges from one part of the battlefield to another.<br/><br/>The battle of Gaugamela seems to have been exaggerated beyond anything any Greek Historian could come up with, history now shows that the numbers were a little more equal than the Greek version, and given that the Parthians and Sassanid's subsequently saw off 6 Roman invasions I tend to believe the revised version, that Alexander after defeating a minor border kingdom was forced to retreat from India, when an army nearly ten times the size of his own was on its way.<br/><br/>Where the film Troy for example delivers in both acting and plot, this film is such a disappointment on so many level. The only highlights were the narration and the use of a birds eye battle view camera shots which I thought was inventive.<br/><br/>Farrel wearing uniforms and armour particularly helmets that looked several sizes too big for him, made poor Alexander quite comical at times I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Whowever cast this movie should be sacked, next time do not cast an actor who looks like Mr Puniverse, and then allow him to look terrified throughout the whole movie as someone who is supposed to be a man who other men would follow to the ends of the earth."
"KoscheiTheDeathless","3","3","5","12 January 2008"," Not bad, but certainly not good
","Hollywood directors are certain that they know what we want to see. They know what puts asses in seats. So when they have a real chance (and enough extras) to show us a modicum of accuracy regarding ancient battles, over and over again they say to us: ""Naw, you don't want to see that. You want to see Braveheart in it's 80th incarnation. Trust me."" The history is there for anyone to read. How did our ancestors do it? How did they combine superior training, metallurgy, discipline, and morale, all on the bedrock of culture, to create a military machine that sometimes achieved kill ratios of 30-to-1 over it's Eastern enemies? How did they study the enemy and develop countermeasures to his strengths? The importance of tactics, choosing ground, flanking movements, maintaining vital formations and unit cohesion; Stone, Scott and their ilk don't care about any of this. They ask themselves: ""If I had naught but sword and shield, how would I fight?"" Then they make a movie. That's why we have gaps in the line large enough to drive a semi through, and phalangites attempting to fight off elephants in the thickest forest Oliver Stone could find. <br/><br/>My main problem with this film, however, is that the personage of Alexander the Great never makes an appearance. Instead Stone has given us a pseudo-Alexander, a weepy little flower played by Farrell (who is NOT leading man material for any film) whose every syllable is leaden with emotion and self-doubt, who is always on the verge of tears, and who above all wants his daddy to wuv him. Nowhere to be seen is the young man who took 47,000 men and took all of modern Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan and who never lost a battle. Nowhere is the supremely confident strategos who broke enemy lines with his cavalry charges and whose enemies, toward the end, thought him a god walking the earth. Yes, he may have been a drunk, and he may have enjoyed pederasty. But he was also the most successful and magnificent military commander in recorded history. You'd never know it from this movie. The real Alexander was folded steel to Farrell's soggy loaf of bread.<br/><br/>So, what Stone got right: the uniforms and armor, historical names and references, and to a lesser extent formations. What he got wrong: everything else."
"darkscion1","1","3","5","13 July 2006"," Alexander the Not So Great
","This is probably one of the worst movies I had to submit my eyes to watching. Oliver Stone's Alexander is supposedly a biographical film detailing the life of one history's most influential figures. Everything that made Alexander the Great ""Great"" was left out of this movie. Instead, the film ""Alexander"" focuses on Alexander's bisexuality and people telling Alexander how great he really is.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that's so bad on so many levels, that it would probably be easier to list the good qualities since it would take up less space. The only halfway decent quality of Alexander is the set design and costumes.<br/><br/>Where should I begin on what's wrong with this movie? I'll start with casting. Colin Farrell is by far (in my opinion) the worst person to play Alexander the Great. First off, Colin Farrell is Irish, he doesn't look Greek, and when you look at him on screen, you know its Colin Farrell. They gave Colin a blonde dye job for his hair. They forgot about his five o'clock shadow and eyebrows. Oh well.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie plays Alexander's mother. She's from Macedonia yet has a Russian sounding accent, a poor one at that. Also, Angelina Jolie is only 1 year older than Colin Farrell.<br/><br/>A major flaw in Alexander is the editing. Nothing is in chronological order. The movie begins with Alexander's childhood, then jumps all around in no sequential order. Throughout the entire film, the characters talk about Alexander's father's murder. But the actual murder scene isn't shown until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The only 2 battle scenes in this movie were poorly shot. They're blurry and its hard to see who's fighting who. For some reason in the second battle scene, Alexander gets injured and everything starts to turning into a neon red color. The movie goes from being a historical film, to a drug film like The Wall or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. During the first battle scene, Oliver Stone decided to put subtitles up to let the audience know which ""flank"" we were looking at. So automatically, that kills the feel of the movie, reminding the audience, ""you are watching a movie"" instead of giving the feel that you're in an ancient time period.<br/><br/>The dialogue is atrocious in Alexander. Not only is this movie 90% talking, its not even interesting. Literally in every scene, someone mentions or tells to Alexander's face how ""great"" he is. To make it even worse, the bad acting sometimes made the dialogue laughable. Colin Farrell and Jared Leto must say at least 6 times in this movie that if one of them dies, the other one will kill them self. ""If you die Alexander, I'll die with you."" My main problem with Alexander is that this movie is about a man who conquered over 100 regions in a matter of 10 years, yet, this movie shows only 2 poorly filmed battle scenes. Given, it would be impossible to show every battle that Alexander was in. Instead, Anthony Hopkins as the Narrator, drones on about all the victories Alexander achieved. The rest of the movie is mostly Alexander sitting in different palace courts hugging Jared Leto a little too affectionately, drinking wine, and making out with male dancers. I realize the whole gay thing is popular with cinema right now, but Alexander the Great's sexual preferences had nothing to do with what he accomplished: Bringing the western world together with the eastern world.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time watching this piece of garbage. Watch the History Channel Documentary on Alexander the Great instead. Its about two hours shorter, and you'll learn a lot more than this supposed ""Historical Biography."""

","""Coming out of tiny Macedonia, Alexander (356-323 B.C.), led his armies against the mighty Persian Empire, drove west to Egypt, and finally made his way east to India. This film will concentrate on those eight years of battles, as well as his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaestion. Alexander died young, of illness, at 33.""<br/><br/>The good: Young Alexander calms and rides wild black stallion Bucephalus; Val Kilmer as Alexander's warrior father Phillip shows the boy cave drawings of Greek myths which presage Alexander's life... Two battles - the first at Gaugamela where young Alexander defeated King Darius and the second - magnificent and spectacular battle of Alexander's army against elephants in India with the unforgettable shot of Alexander on his horse against the huge animal; the surreal atmosphere of the last battle thanks to the color red that dominated the scene as seen through the eyes of the wounded Alexander. Legendary Babylon with its Tower and the hanging Gardens is breathtaking as it is shown in the movie. Angelina Jolie was regal....when her mouth was shut and here I come to the bad and the ridiculous. Who on earth decided that the Queen of the Ancient Macedonia in the 4th Century B.C.) should speak with the most horrible imitation of an Eastern European accent ever on the screen? The scenes between Jolie and Farrell made me laugh - so bizarre and ludicrous they were. Besides, even if I assume that Olimpias had Alexander when she was very young, 15 or 16, she did not change a bit when he was 25, and they looked together like a brother and a sister or two lovers - not like a mother and son. The real problem is that with all the and passion for his project and its subject, Stone could not make his overlong (almost three hours) movie as interesting and convincing as just some of its parts are. I have nothing against non-linear structure - when it works but here it was distracting and confusing - the only way to realize where and when you were was by watching the length of Alexander's hair. As for Farrell in the titular role, he was not bad - he is just not charismatic enough. I could not help thinking of another Alexander the Great project - Baz Luhrman's with Leonardo DiCaprio - who is a better actor and who was incredibly good in the last year's ""The Aviator""...

","I watched this movie knowing that it would obviously have nothing to do with the actual historical figure. That the way it always happens. Anyway, that said, I don't understand why they could have least known their subject somewhat. They portrayed Philip as a womanizing pain in the ass who has homosexual tendencies. This is clearly shown in his wedding feast when he supposedly dis-inherits Alexander. But later, there is a flashback which shows this was never the case. The feast was really a homosexual porno scene. During the whole movie, you are given signs that Alexander was homosexual, but then he get married and you are left completely confused. What is going on here, this doesn't make sense. At the end of the movie I really felt let down and felt that my movie was wasted."

","I am a part of the East Coast Film community here in the United States... I don't make 'films', When people ask what I do I say: ""I point cameras"" and ""great, that got out in six hours!"" but: I do crank out more watchable hours per week than an average unemployed film maker snob cranks out in 15 years. I'm a really bad film maker. I know it. It takes one to know one so here goes: I don't think Oliver Stone actually watched the entire movie after the edits were made.<br/><br/>Here's the scoop: Script is brainy, camera work is great, lighting horrible, music good and bad at the same time, overall executive management of film was present like it should have been.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is great except for three people: One: THe lighting designer (who thinks that relentless day-glow pink is a great substitute for bonfire lights in bacchanalian revel shots)Two: The director- someone who did 'shots for hire', saw the dailies, took the 15 minutes of great photography and slowed it 5fps so it would stretch out to 25 minutes of an otherwise horribly executively-directed movie then didn't actually watch the entire movie (EVER), and three: the hair stylist, who... uh... who? All the actors did an incredible job... All of them, so the casting was fine.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's hubris really shone through on this. It shone through so much that the 'editor's cut' edition of the movie had some of the most pathetic editing ever... and as an audience member, I was actually wondering: ""Did Stone and the producers really think I didn't notice that Angelina's lips weren't moving while she delivered that line in a close up face shot?"" Don't believe me? Watch the director's cut. You will actually see a 25 second scene, halfway through, where you hear Angelina talking, see her head-shot on screen, but her lips are actually not moving.<br/><br/>She's talking... but the lips aren't moving.<br/><br/>OK... double check Yes... Major Hollywood director's cut and a main high Cost actor's words are clearly and audibly spoken, but the lips on the head shot ain't moving.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone did not actually watch the entire movie through after the edits were made.<br/><br/>If he did, and let all the slip-ups through that happened, he needs intervention.<br/><br/>Was that some 'Art-haus' thing? Strange that it only happened once in the movie. I don't have to go on about this. Not worth it. My NYU film student intern editors won't even let that garbage happen.<br/><br/>This is poor production management through and through, and the investors in this film should find a lawyer as soon as possible.<br/><br/>This movie has a great script and great actors: But the writers and actors are made to look like fools by slack producers, executives and directors.<br/><br/>My advice to the talent who put their heart and soul into this film.... well... I have too much class to say it.<br/><br/>You know what I think.<br/><br/>As for the investors in this film; I would seriously examine your options on recouping."

","The biggest struggle in my head after watching this movie: <br/><br/>History has it that when Alexander conquered Persia, he set the grand Palace of Persia on fire and nothing remained of it except for stones... as you can clearly see this today, judging by the remains of what is called "" Takhte Jamshid "" - Jamshid's Thrown - which is located near Shiraz. That was what I was expecting to see every minute for the first half of the movie. Maybe Oliver Stone couldn't afford it huh?! :D But the whole setting on fire thing is totally against the character which is presented as Alexander. U've watched it, would u believe he has done such a thing?!<br/><br/>The other thing which is banging against the walls of my head is all the gay stuff going on in the movie. Was it really necessary? There was also a ""penis shot"" which I can't figure out what good does it do to the story.<br/><br/>Anyways I watched it! But I wouldn't watch it twice."

","Oh, dear. I thought Troy was pretty bad, although enjoyable, but this swords and sandals epic manages to be bad without being enjoyable. The fault is mostly in the screenplay which handles flashbacks and flash-forwards in a rather ham-fisted fashion, and contains some of the most risible dialogue I've heard since the 'love scene' in Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. The actors all do their best, but they're not really given much to work with.<br/><br/>The one redeeming feature is that they were brave enough to portray Alexander's same-sex relationship, rather than doing a Troy and pretending that the pair are cousins or friends. But even this is rather clunky and awkward."
"ctseeker","2","3","5","8 September 2005"," Not Oliver Stones best
","This film could not keep my attention. It seemed to try to be a great Shakespeare epic in the writing of the dialog. I was bored to know end every time someone opened their mouths.<br/><br/>Not to mention the poor choice of Jolie as Alexander's mother, her make up looked more like something from a Demille Egyptian epic, plus she just doesn't portray a Greek woman from her accent to her looks. Plus when did she have Alexander when she was like 5 years old, they could have aged her at the very least. <br/><br/>When Alexander started into one of his speeches around his troops I would have taken my sword and slayed him on the spot even if would have ended my own life, just to shut him up. The dialog stank and it's delivery was poorly done and annoying. <br/><br/>Stone is historically known to portray history to express his own political views is still in full force in this movie. ref. JFK theories, and the nazi flag on a American APC in Platoon at the end. He is noted for this in his films. So the bisexual issues where just his style to portray for good or bad. He has Alexander reacting to the death of his male lover with more emotion than his own wife. So he pushes the bi to the gay side more in the image of Alexander, maybe for shock value. But then again if I used this film as a representation of the Greek way of family back then seems that men where gay and only had wives to have children to produce heirs, treating women more as babymills and property. But who knows maybe it was that way back then.<br/><br/>I watched the Directors cut maybe the minutes that where tossed on the cutting room floor are the ones I needed to bring the whole story together.<br/><br/>In entertainment value I would rather be entertained by Richard Burton in Alexander the Great than this modern reproduction. This version had better acting, better script and didn't need the nudity or the sexuality issue brought up. But this is me. However if your a Shakesphere fan you might find this film entertaining, because your the one who can follow it."

Not even the Couple of battle scenes with some good effects could pull this off, it's boring, REALLY boring believe me, Anthony Hopkins is just popping up in the movie when action starts to talk about How Great Alexander was, and the Legend. Angelina Jolie plays Alexanders mother, and really how great she looks, she couldn't stop this from being a disaster, the movie is done in terrible fashion, if you have to see it that much rent it first! don't go wasting your money and paying full whack, i received this for my 18th b/day present. i collect all the Epics, and this truly is the worst. Collin Farrell is awful the worst movie I've seen him in, Alexander looks stupid! Really every things poor, the look, the feel, how it was filmed, it's totally weird.

","I have heard from many that this was a fascinating epic about the life of Alexander the Great, but when I saw this movie I could only think ""I've finally found a movie worse than Troy."" First off to begin on my criticizing on how this movie was bad (Oh where do I begin?) well of course there is the acting, every time Colin Farrel's lips started moving I knew that I wasn't going to en thrilled by his very dry acting, with lines that make a elementary school play seem like Matchbeth you know this one is deemed to be a Oscar winner. Since I've talked about one negative I might as well give a good reason to watch this pile of garbage.Well the battle scenes are very well done and are as close to realism as they can get, unfortunately there are only two in the movie(and the last half of the second battler is more like an acid trip). Oh one more thing, Alexander's death at the end is laugh out loud funny ""Ahh""(Alexander falls on ground.) So to summarize this movie, all I can say is and I can't believe I'm saying this but go see Troy instead.<br/><br/>Overall(since I'm nice and I don't want any more hate mail)3/10"

","What I loved about the movie: - the soundtrack is sure to be an Olympic ice skaters staple... it achieves the grandeur of Alexander, close you eyes and use your imagination when you get bored of wading thru the movie on screen - the battle scenes are spectacular but close your eyes if you are an animal lover - Jared Leto made his character come to life in his facial expressions toward Alexander and should have played a much larger role to make the Gay love story more of a focus for the movie - Angelina Jolie was superb as the mysterious and fearless mother of Alexander (but I found all those snakes distracting)<br/><br/>What I hated about the movie: -Colin Farrell was awful and you never identify with Alexander... even I was wanting to poison him toward the end. -Anthony Hopkins was talking so much I thought I had mistakenly put my DVD on a commentary track - Too much animal violence for me - I wanted some gay scenes between Colin and Jared but the movie seemed reluctant to show them together either romantically or physically. - The movie was too long although if it had a story I wouldn't have minded"
"oleone","9","7","17","16 January 2005"," The best movie i've seen in the year!
","This movie is excellent! The cinematography and photography is remarkable... i liked the angles of the shots: those long shots with all the army before they struggle into battle is beautiful; also to see the perspective and all those elements framed. It has a great gay content: many conversations of Alexander with Hephaistion are really close... they almost kiss! Instead they hug each other... But you can see the love and caring each one had for each other, the loyalty of Hephaistion for Alexander and the trust the later had for Hephaistion: He saved Alex from his doom. If you don't like gay or bisexual content, these scenes were lightened up (i guess) to ensure general public's sensitivity don't gets hurt. It's a great movie.. worth seen besides of this.<br/><br/>The customs, locations, soundtrack and movie titles... are excellent. They really did research on the outfits, because all the encounters with non-Macedonians tribes... are dressed the way it should have been: the Babylonians are dressed with those beautiful dresses and beard.. the same you see on the Babylonian statues. It's impressive they're reconstruction of Babylon! I heard it's walls were covered with lapis lazuli, but watching the recreation of it... it's amazing!<br/><br/>All those landscapes were beautiful... it was like a 3 hour trip in a movie... from Macedonia, Egypt to India... Very nice...<br/><br/>The soundtrack is very nice also, since you here those classic compositions of great movies with its overtures and the ""classic"" women voice in Gladiot's style, but this time with an Asian edge.<br/><br/>Movie titles are excellent, since it displays all the symbols used in the movie, in a short sequence... Statues, eagles and ancient writing... with a nice blue light layered with slow fades between images and a liquid effect. Also, what i liked mostly was the use of Alexander's name in all those different languages spoken at the time: Fenician, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Greek and Babylonian, to mention a few.<br/><br/>The performance of Colin Farrel is OK, the same of Angelina's and Jared's... <br/><br/>Hope you see the movie and like it..."
"pyotr-3","10","7","17","26 November 2004"," Stunning, magnificent movie - and it is stunning the world
","I congratulate Oliver Stone on being the first director to create a major motion picture about a historical figure who happens to have been gay in a relatively accurate manner. Bravo, Oliver! ""Alexander"" is a huge film, about a huge person from an era that most people have almost no understanding of. It had to be a very difficult film to make, since there was so much to tell. Credit must be given for tackling such a formidable task. I found ""Alexander"" to be moving and magnificent. The acting, the battle scenes, the storyline all fell into place to me. I am puzzled as to why so many bad reviews of this film have appeared in mainstream American publications, but after considering AUDIENCE reaction I think I know why: Most straight people seem to have been stunned by this film. I heard snickering and giggles during the most serious, somber and beautiful scenes between Alexander and Hephaestion. It was quite pathetic, actually. It showed ho incapable most straight people STILL are of accepting the fact that those of us who are gay also experience love - just as they do. I will never understand why so many people can not grasp this simple notion, but I assume it is simply the result of having never SEEN it, since even the show ""Will & Grace"" never shows any of the gay characters in an actual relationship, in love, or in bed with a lover. The straight character, Grace, is in bed with countless men and no one blinks an eye, yet the networks refuse even a kiss to Will. So it should be no surprise that Americans remain homophobic and rather clueless about this harmless aspect of the life of all gay persons: love. I think the movie ""Alexander"" is revolutionary inasmuch as it allows people the first view of a gay hero which does not TOTALLY hide the truth of who he truly loved. It will stimulate debate, and some learning will take place as a result. Alexander built libraries and improved conditions for people in many places that he conquered... he was hailed as a liberator in some places... he revolutionized the treatment of women to some extent and he made shaving one's beard popular for the first time. Many things about Alexander were left out of the movie, and I hope that Stone's film ill encourage people to go read about him now. The book to read is Robin Lane Fox's ""Alexander the Great."" This is the best book written for a thorough overview of his life. Many others written are rather uninteresting - and it is a shame when history is made boring. When you tell the truth in history, it suddenly pops to life, and Fox's book does just that. All scholars recognize it as the best source of info."

The ONLY good thing about this movie was the historical significance (which was inaccurate, by the way). Everything else was terrible, especially the acting. Honestly, I expected better from Colin Farell. Especially the scene where his father is murdered. Isn't he supposed to be, I don't know, SAD or something!

Not that I had difficulty understanding who was who: the Macedonians spoke with Irish accents, the Greeks with Scottish, the Persians with Indian and the Indians themselves--well, they simply ran out of accents so said nothing.<br/><br/>But who was who and who clearly didn't want to be in this movie at all (Anthony Hopkins) was just about all that was comprehensible in this sword and sandal epic penned and directed by the man who began his history rewriting with JFK, then made Jim Morrison turn over in his grave.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone clearly wants to impress us with a deep, methodical and penetrating psychoanalysis of the complexity of the Alexander character. He offers insight into the oedipal and bisexual influences that shaped the world's most driven and successful conqueror, and invites us to delve deep into a sullen, swirling maelstrom of a mind and from there to look outwards at a world never fully understanding let alone accepting that it is in the presence of a higher being near deification.<br/><br/>So he casts Colin Farrell to play the part!

","And this coming from a Stone fan for whom Oliver's films makeup about 7% (second only to Spielberg) of his DVD collection. I have often defended Stone against critics of movies such as JFK, fully believing his showing the story how he believed it happened as well within his artistic license.<br/><br/>I am therefore disappointed both in this film and in Stone's arrogant insistence that it is doing badly because everyone is homophobic. When I paid money to watch a film on Alexander the Great, I paid money to be shown how Alexander used his military genius to conquer the (then) known world. I expected ingenious military tactics, large scale impressive battles, the workings of the inner demons of the man, his rise and his fall.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few dull action scenes that could easily have been deleted scenes from Troy and Gladiator sown together, all I saw was a man who couldn't get over his mother being childish, naive, crying every couple of minutes and, yes, lusting after various men. Stone is being historically accurate, fans are quick to scream. I will not contest the fact that there were may have been elements of these behaviours in the real Alexander, but were they his defining attributes? Are they why we know who he is today? Are they why he was such a huge influence on modern history? Are they why he was ""great""? I think not. In fact I think in comparison to the conquests of this great man, these elements are largely irrelevant and should not make up the bulk of a movie about him. Mere references are sufficient. In Gladiator, Maximus, the main character is straight. Do we have endless scenes with him looking longingly at women just to hit the audience over the head with the fact that he is straight?<br/><br/>Other than the lack of focus on the important issue at hand, the other main problem with this movie is the cheese of it all. Angelina Jolie is comical as Alexander's Russian Bond girl mother. Anthony Hopkins is disgraced into having to read some of the most inane lines in history and Colin Farrell simply looks like a sissy for most of the movie, mostly because of the incessant weeping and whining. The sex scene with Rosario Dawson brings memories of Gigli back to haunt me. I remember the audience where I watched it couldn't stop laughing from all the laughable dialogue being banded around.<br/><br/>Altogether the movie was a waste of time.

","This is easily the worst movie I've seen in 2004, but it's bad in a way I thought Hollywood didn't do anymore, bad in a full-on, gonzo, over-the-top kind of fashion that actually makes it kind of ""good"", or at least entertaining.<br/><br/>Start with what must be called homosexual panic. I am sure Stone wanted to do what he saw as the ""right thing"" by his story, and dramatize the bisexuality that was common in the era. But it's also true that Stone, judging by what's on screen, doesn't understand homosexuality, and is more than a little panicked by it. Thus we have the strongly implied notion that Alexander's bisexuality was directly related to an overbearing mother and a strong, distant, father, which is a notion of homosexuality that wouldn't have seemed out of place in, say, 1952, but seems more than a little quaint today. Thus we have clichéd ""pretty boys"" flouncing around exaggeratedly, we have a surprising lack of male nudity, given the stated subject matter, etc. It would all be very offensive if it wasn't so ridiculous. This is like your Dad getting all down and sweaty to your rock records -- striving to be ""hip"" is never anything less than funny.<br/><br/>Add to it Angelina Jolie, who chews the scenery with some kind of weirdo Bulgarian/Romanian accent that doesn't fit with anything else anyone else is doing. Add to it Val Kilmer -- it's like he wandered in from the Viking movie down the street. Add to it my favorite love scene of 2004, between the incredibly beautiful Rosario Dawson and Colin Farrell, where they get naked and slap each other.<br/><br/>Add to it the world's worst screenplay. Well, no, that's harsh: how about the world's most incompetent screenplay? One doesn't know where to begin -- Anthony Hopkins droning on and on and on, helpfully explaining the Meaning of It All in case we didn't get it? The incredibly clumsy flashback that occurs 3/4 through the picture and gives us the motivation for Alexander's conquests? (Why on earth was this a flashback?) Jolie ""writing Alexander"" to tell ""him"" (really us) what the political situation at home is? How about the fact that in an incredibly action-packed life, we only see two battles, one of which (the India one) is badly shot and ends with color freak-outs that I'm sure I remember from NATURAL BORN KILLERS? (The other battle scene is well done, but is prefaced by a lame scene where Alexander has to explain to his ""generals"" -- really us -- what we're about to see.) How about the fact that there's no real theme or arc to this story, that it doesn't seem to understand how to dramatize a life and instead ticks off the major events in a sluggish, chronological way? And I'm not even touching the ridiculous use by Stone of Motifs (the Meaningful Glances between Farrell and Leto, say) or Leto, who apparently is doing Clare Daines doing a Greek warrior, or the buckets of mascara used by the cast, or Farell's dullness (is there a more overrated actor working today than Farrell?) or Kilmer's appearance as a Meaningful Ghost near the end. Etc.<br/><br/>Unaccountably taken seriously by most critics, who've missed the boat here completely, and are giving it lackluster reviews as a result. If you understand what you're getting into -- and you have three hours to kill -- you'll enjoy it. Bring some booze, though."

","I don't know how this movie is receiving Oscar buzz. The dialogue is long-winded and overly dramatic. The dialects of the main characters change throughout the course of the movie. Oliver Stone is known for creating long films and most of the time i don't mind his thoroughness, but in this case the movie was overdrawn and repetitive. The flashback scenes were out of place and actually deterred from the motive of the movie. If we had seen Kilmer's death before Alexander swept the world to fulfill and exceed his father's dream, maybe it would have been more believable. Simply knowing that this guy actually existed and did these things is not enough to capture the audience, Oliver Stone has to show us and support it with logical thought. Whatever happened to the story telling from JFK or the imagery from Natural Born Killers. Hopefully Oliver Stone, who i respect and love, has not lost his mind but based upon the weak plot, over-the-top acting and general poor nature of this film it may seem that his ability has run its course."
"oso_travis","5","4","8","4 December 2004"," A pretentious and expensive piece of trash. Without a single doubt, the Worst Film of the Year.
","Alexander. Directed by Oliver Stone. *<br/><br/>I am so grateful for a film like ""Alexander"". And here are the reasons why:<br/><br/>1) Because its box office bombing status and the madness (in a ""we want to rip you apart"" kind of way) among critics could bury the ""return to epics"" we had this year; don't take me wrong, good old epics were great, but when you start getting stuffed with major turkeys like ""Troy"", ""King Arthur"", and our national treasure ""Zapata"" it is time to say the idea good-bye.<br/><br/>2) It is living proof that either Stone got old and lost every last bit of his talent or he has been the most overrated director around for a long time. For every Zemeckis, Howard or Spielberg there is actually a director that knows what he is doing (i.e. Payne, Haynes, Araki); but this year Stone might defeat them all and be crowned as the new Overrated Champ. It is so funny to see over 30 years old hardcore Stone's fans to stand up and defend Stone and his new ""masterwork"", when in fact a motion picture should speak for itself: the film is awful.<br/><br/>I will not go into big details on how bad this film is. Let's just say that both my ears and eyes could not believe it. Angie Jolie embarrassing herself for the 15th time. Farrell giving the audience a stalwart masterclass on Bad Acting. Hopkins granting the expression ""verbal vomit"" a new dimension. One of the most dreadful screenplay written in years; and probably the most talky film in the last 10 years! There's not a moment of silence or meditation on it. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk and talk. Geez!<br/><br/>I think the only people that can keep themselves from embarrassment is Rodrigo Prieto and his photography, Elliot Cowan as Ptolemy, Connor Paolo as Young Alexander, and Rory McCann as Crateros. Holy Cow! Even Vangelis' music is as corny and mellow as it can get. Totally, out of place.<br/><br/>Save your time, money and self from this stinker. You've been warned.<br/><br/>Note: One thing is ""killing"" a lot of extras, and a different one, ""killing"" innocent elephants and horses. It made me sick. I know they are not hurt because of sues, but why do you have to abuse the audience? I hope some elephants may escape from San Diego Zoo and go straight to WB studios.<br/><br/>5/10"
"dgodfrey4","Null","4","8","3 December 2004"," A great example on how to ruin a good story.
","I have a History degree. I have read numerous books about Alexander. I have watched several TV documentaries about the character, including the one about the making of this movie. Even with all this background I had a terrible time just trying to figure out what was going on in the movie. The director took what could have been a GREAT story and muddied so badly by leaving out important events in Alexander's life while emphazing the idea that he was (perhaps) AC/DC over and over and over again. Colin Farrell did a superb job of acting and made his character very believable. As far as the other actors, I've seen more empathy on a High School Drama stage. The director completely ignored the action of Philip conquering Greece, and Alexander's command of the calvary as a desicive part of that battle. He ignored the great battles with Darius prior to Galgameth. He skipped over Alexander in Eygpt. Even the battle scenes, which were very elaborate, were ruined by the director's camera angles, special visual effects, and stop-start filming. If Alexander had not himself described what his plans were in the battle against Darius, the viewer would have had no idea at all what was going on (the famous ""gap"" that happened in the Persian lines was invisible in the scene). I looked forward to viewing this film ever since it was first announced as going into production. It was a huge disappointment."
"alexandros-4","Null","4","8","1 December 2004"," HISTORICAL FACT???
","I just saw the movie and was greatly disappointed by Stone's total lack of intuition as well as his BLATANT DISREGART for historical facts. Let me start with one of the main facts the movie seems to be stuck on, Alexander's ""supposed"" bisexuality. Where exactly did you discover that fact Mr. Stone? Where is the evidence in Alexander's historical portrait that he was in any way involved sexually with men, boys, whether passively or actively or in any way? Have you ever read PLUTARCH by any chance? And if you haven't where did you trust to collect your factual analysis from? I have to believe that either Stone has had wet dreams about doing it with Alexander or the other brilliant mind, Christopher Kyle or was it the ""academic"" Robin Lane Fox who is mainly responsible for the material from which the script came? It simply blows my mind, how someone can base what they call a biographical, historical epos on some arbitrary choices hoping that a little controversy might sell a bit more. Well, unfortunately not even controversy can save this movie as it turned out to be utterly boring, misleading, confusing and overall presenting the greatest warrior of all time as a disgustingly whimsical figure who was torn over every single decision he had to make throughout his life. And why didn't the most famous story of Alexander's spirit and personality, the GORDIAN KNOT, was never mentioned Mr. Stone? Maybe because that would ruin your totally gay depiction of the Great Warrior as it clearly shows his directness and resolve in everything he did throughout his mythical life. The only disastrous thing the movie didn't do is make Alexander to be a Slav as this is another moronic propaganda that is trying to infiltrate the brainless American masses these days. God help us for what will protect us if we can't even remember the truth in our own history? George Orwell is what comes to mind..."
"craigscurtis","1","4","8","1 December 2004"," Couldn't wait...
","I just couldn't wait for someone to kill Alexander and put the audience out of it's misery! I have to question my sanity for actually choosing to see an Oliver Stone disaster. This film was painful to watch from beginning to end. The cinematography, editing, scripting, acting, everything screamed run to the box office and get a refund. The only thing that kept me from doing that was that I didn't want to feel the need to rent it some other time in case I missed something worthwhile. What a mistake. While I would consider this a tie with The Day After Tomorrow for worst movie of the year, Alexander had a larger budget and stellar cast that helped make it the biggest bomb of the year. I imagine Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer are relieved that they had such heavy makeup on and can hope they weren't recognized."
"mooseyspaz","1","4","8","29 November 2004"," Worst Movie Ever
","This was the biggest waste of 3 hours I have ever seen. Not only was the movie horribly directed, it had a complete lack of continuity. It seemed more like a collection of pointlessly gratuitous scenes, all jumbled together with no purpose. Watching the movie gives you the impression that they were trying to make another Gladiator or Troy, but they just had no Idea what they were doing, so they just filmed a bunch of scenes, and edited them together. I think Oliver Stone tried to market this movie by making it so controversially gay that people would get hyped about it. But obviously it didn't work, as it has been a huge flop at the box office. No self respecting human being would ever recommend this movie to anyone, and most who go to see it will feel like they have been wronged in some horrible way. Oliver Stone has done some wonderful movies, but now has ranked himself among the very worst of the worst. If this review will keep just one poor person from having to endure this joke of a movie, then I, like thousands of others who were suckered into watching this movie, can feel a little bit of comfort knowing that at least we can help others from the same, horrible fate."
"mswatsoninc","Null","4","8","29 November 2004"," Something to ponder
","I have read through many of the comments on hear--most of them being mixed ranging from ""loved it,"" ""luke warm,"" to ""don't waste your time.""<br/><br/>What I find the most fascinating is most people who knock the film find some way of stating throughout the course of the panning that Alexander was portrayed as too gay. I find it fascinating, because in the very next breath of a bad review, the tagline usually says, ""But, Angelina Jolie was hot."" Interesting double standard. Perhaps some people are ""too straight"" to write an objective review, though I'm sure Ms. Jolie will take the compliment if not necessarily reciprocate it in all cases.<br/><br/>James Bond through the course of 2 hours is totally expected to bed every woman he comes in contact with--all the while saving the day--but, for Alexander to be preoccupied with sex is totally outrageous in comparison with his quest to dominate the world as he knew it. If you think soldiers don't think about sex in the foxholes--think again. It's been said that the average male thinks about sex thousands of times a day. Just because you don't happen to agree with whom he chooses to make the apples of his eyes doesn't make it any less of a fact.<br/><br/>For those others who like to categorize Alexander's sexuality as ""speculative,"" read a book on antiquity. Before the days of Christianity (remember the days when they fed them to the lions?), ancient Greek and Roman men had homosexual lovers. Bare in mind, this was well before the birth of Christ. Once he was born, and the Christians got the upper hand as far as control, making Zeus and Jupiter pagan gods insuring a one way ticket to hell, it should come as no surprise that they wanted to damn everything that ancient Greeks and Romans did--down to their societal beliefs. The fact that it was ""hinted at"" rather than graphically portrayed is probably due in part to the fact Stone wanted his film to ""play malls."" After all, it's called ""show business."" I say, if you weren't prepared to see what you saw, maybe you should consider it a gift. If you were expecting to see ""Platoon"" in loin cloths and togas and feel you left the cinema cheated, think of how disappointed you'd have been seeing a historically accurate rendition of Old Alex's life. Good luck getting Colin Farrell to agree to that, too, I'm sure. There's an awful lot of ""Red States"" out there, and just because you might not like history, questioning it's validity doesn't make it any less true. <br/><br/>Not enough battle scenes? Possibly. Questionable accents? Definitely. A ""too gay"" portrayal of Alexander? Doubtful."
"s_penning","1","4","8","28 November 2004"," Craptacular
","This movie had terrific production and effects but unfortunately, it is marred by bad direction and awful writing. The horribly misplaced accents are laughable, the historical accuracy is beyond ludicrous and the story is just plain bad. It is obvious that the movie only had one historical consultant and that Oliver Stone has done little more than glance at a history book since his elementary education. Any of the truly significant events of Alexander's life are either completely omitted or simply glossed over. I will refuse to comment on Collin Farrell's acting talent except to say that through the magic of bad writing, direction and his own portrayal, they've portrayed Alexander as a man who couldn't lead a troop of girl scouts to deliver cookies, much less to conquer the known world. The painful insertion of Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother gives testament to the fact that somebody on the screen writing team has seen ""I, Claudius"" as the parallels are all too apparent between the humorously never aging Olympias and Livia.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the worst historical 'epics' Hollywood has produced in ages."

The scenery of both cities were very beautiful and it gives you the passion to want to live there in the past. The Battle of Gaugamela was really intensifying and the atmosphere of that battle was SUPERB! I was amazed to see that the fighting was very graphic.

This movie had no character development, told the story in a very confusing and not cohesive manner, and simply rubbed me the wrong way with the pessimistic themes. It was ridiculous actually, I saw it a screening in L.A. and the whole theater left the movie ranting about how awful it was and at one point, some man in the back yelled out ""WHY WON'T YOU(Alexander) JUST DIE?"" and the rest of us laughed uproariously.

Nevertheless I think this is a great movie. Good performance from Collin MacFarrel, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Anthony Hopkin's performance is good as usual. I am still impressed by the effort of Mr Stone to show in the 3 hours movie the complete story of Alexander.

The script is simply and absolutely terrible, not one single line inspired anything in me at all, it was stilted, slow, forced, boring and lacking in any enthusiasm what so ever.<br/><br/>2. The acting was disgraceful. Not one single line (from such a bad script) was delivered in anyway that could be described as acting. Farrell voice seemed to strain to even give a battle rousing speech, Jolie with her accent, just turned her performance into a joke, not even Anthony Hopkins could help, though his role was too small to be of any consequence. Must I go on? 3. The battle scenes, rumoured to be some of the best ever, we patchy, far to quick and hardly even able to be seen, due mainly to the speed of the camera trying to give the premise of lots going on and failing utterly to do so. The first battle scene was over far two quickly, three moves of Darius' fingers and he is turning tail and running off in fear. The second major battle was just a huge and catastrophic mess.<br/><br/>4. The attempts at portraying a relationship between Alexander and Haphaiston, which though historically may well be true, here fell flat on their face: nothing looked genuine at all, the hugging the looks, the silences, nothing.<br/><br/>In short, I watched this film until the end merely because I had paid to see it and wanted to think, indeed hope, that it would get better: it didn't.<br/><br/>Awful!

","This was probably the worst movie I've seen in a while, and I've seen some pretty bad ones (ie the new Exorcist movie). When I heard this was going to be an Oliver Stone film, I thought to myself, ""Black and white off kilter shots and hallucinatory shots in a movie about one of the legends of European history, sounds greaaaatt."" I had my doubts. They were confirmed from the very beginning. The first shot probably had Old Orson Wells rolling in his grave (if there's even enough room down there for him), as the first words that come to any self respecting film goers lips would be ""Rosebud..."" The film's characters fail to capture the heart, because they remain near static throughout, and we learn nothing about them save that they were given a poor script to read from.<br/><br/>That brings me to the next point, the dialogue. The dialogue at points was so horrendous I actually considered walking out of the theatre (something I have never considered doing). Apart from the occasional good line ""Such a price to pay for 9 months lodging in her womb,"" the dialogue goes from one tright and clichéd discourse to the next. The one monologue which almost peaked my interest was interrupted mid-sentence to show off some fancy CGI of an eagle flying over the battlefield to the other side. Actually that shot would have been great, had the timing not been SO off pace. The movie drags, when it should be accelerating, and after the first hour I was waiting for ole Alex to snuff it real horrorshow like.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie drags on considerably longer than an hour, and by the end I felt like I had bought discount merchandise in bulk. The only saving grace was some adequate scoring, and glorious cinematography when the tragedy comes to the third act, but even then it is corrupted by the hallucinatory touch of Oliver Stone. NEWSFLASH Ollie, there was no LSD in Ancient Macedonia.<br/><br/>I would urge anyone considering to go see this to skip it and take in Sponge Bob Squarepants instead... At least the drug induced insanity of the characters in that movie fit. In short, I wouldn't suggest this movie to a blind man with ear plugs, because he could still smell the bulls***."

","Last night, with a young lass in tow I was able to get into the movie Alexander. I thought it was a great epic. Old Ptolemy played by Anthony Hopkins muses to his scribe about the days of Alexander. We then see played out on the screen Ptolemy's memories and I believe assumptions about Alexander's life as well as his own. After the film, my date and I headed for my favorite little watering hole, The Outback, and proceeded to start discussing the film. There is no shortage of opinions about this film. Oliver Stone who wrote and directed this film has created just enough controversy that he should be able to laugh all the way to the bank. Again, this is written from the premise of Ptolemy's memory. How can anyone find fault with a point of view that has the own personal bias of the character being played, Hello! Angelina Jolie plays Olympias, Alexander's mommy dearest, and as beautiful as she is as a mom, she was not going to land on a cover of the Ivory Snow Box. She also handled quite a few snakes (we men do love this cheap sexual exploitation) and it was hard to tell if the snakes eyes or Angelina's eyes were more cunning and there is the tiny issue of rather she had Philip, Alexander's dad played by Val Kilmer killed. Truth is, for the historical period it would not have been unheard of and after all, she was a barbarian. You know the old saying if you marry a barbarian do not be surprised if you end up in her stew or something like that. Anyway, you have a couple of scenes depicting the ""close"" relationship between Alexander, played by Colin Farrell and Hephaistion, played by Jared Leto. I mention this because this is one of the things that got Stone in trouble in the States over this film. Americans want to believe everyone is a Heterosexual if they were famous males in history. Please... can someone say - Alexander - Greek States - Greek influence? Maybe he had a male lover? Who knew? Who cares? He was a great leader and influenced world history right up to our current time. If you are a homophobe then you should not see this film. If you are interested in seeing a true tragedy played out as in the old morality plays then I think the film is a must see. If intense emotion gives you a rush but you can keep your pants on for 3 hours - get thee to the theater. If you are looking for a brief synopsis of the film - OK here goes. The story of how the influences, both family and external, of a young Alexander shape the youth into a man, a king. Then the 10 years of conquest to the East as well as the loyalty that Alexander creates amongst his follows. Lastly the fatal flaw that always ends great hero's greatness. They begin to believe their own hype and they trust well if not wisely. So if I had to grade it I would give it 9 out of 10 stars. Was it a great film? I am not a critic. I can say that three hours seemed like minutes and at the end of the film many felt saddened - If you can get patrons to fight their kidneys to stay in the seats and feel any emotion for the characters being played then that regardless of anything else gets you 9 out of 10 stars with me."

","Truly there are two different Alexanders and Colin Farrel played both of them in one film. First one - heroic warrior in epic battle scenes and in colorful ethnic scenes. Oliver Stone made this part of film fantastically. It really works for the viewer. Second one - neurotic bisexual person from the 20th century with all complexes borrowed from Freud's theories. And it's hard to understand how both of them could live and interact in the same time. Mr. Stone was too impressed by Mary Renault's novels about Alexander (Fire from Heaven, The Persian Boy). Mary Renault thought more of her own time than of Antiquity. Yes, bisexuality was normal for the Greeks but Plutarchus insisted that Alexander was shocked when somebody supposed that about him. Why we should believe Mary Renault and not Plutarchus? The sources about Alexander are interesting and intriguing so it's very sad that epic film after the battle sequences turns into Freudistic soap opera style family drama. That's why the film is great but it spoiled. One more mistake - long and looking completely unrealistically foreword and afterword by sir Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy in the beginning and in the end of the film. Anyway - impressive battle sequences, impressive settings of Babylon and Balkh fortress, impressive work of artists and designers, really great music by Vangelis. Oliver Stone tried to show us the light and the dark side of Alexander and of Ancient Greek culture in general and idea was good. Simply it didn't work as a film."

","I watched this movie on DVD, expecting some good time since I come from a country where Alexander and his successors actually share a considerable part of our history and genealogy.<br/><br/>And I tell you, I was so utterly disappointed. This is by far, one of the worst accounts on a historical figure.<br/><br/>I was astounded how some people can try to change everything simply by showing their movie stuff. Alexander has been shown as so unreal and ahistorical, its actually disgusting how people try to change history by showing a badly directed, shallow movie. The character shown here just prompted me to turn off my DVD player immediately! One of history's most ruthless personalities has been shown as so soft and naive? A man who killed thousands, who never left survivors alive, who cleansed the population of Tyros, sacked Persepolis in revenge, killed Porus's own son in hand to hand combat, bloodily repressed the Theban rebels has been as so merciful and gay like? He never led a military campaign in the name of unifying people! Lol. That is utter bullshit! He just wanted power, that is the true historical fact and he had no limits trying to acquire it! This is the reason why he wanted to venture even deeper into India regardless of the fatigue his soldiers were suffering! Not to forget the utterly false relationship he's been shown with Haphaestion! Its pure crap! <br/><br/>I'll stick to the truth. And the truth is that this guy was the total opposite of what has been shown in the movie. Totally opposite, I tell you and that makes this movie completely awful. I give it a 4 though because of the good battle formations. And thats it."

All the actors gave stellar performances, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I just only just saw the movie for the first time on the ION channel this week, and don't know how I had missed it earlier on.<br/><br/>I think it was simply the most historically accurate of any based on what I have read about the life, career and exploits of Alexander.

"valadas","8","2","3","8 January 2012"," Great film too
","The story of the great king, later emperor, Alexander of Macedonia, son of Philip II is here somewhat abridgedly told (for instance Alexander invaded Persia twice and not only once) but with great, beautiful and strong images based on an acceptable screen-play from the historical truth point of view. If not for other virtues that the movie has got, the battle scenes would be enough for they are filmed with great realism and boldness indeed in spite of involving thousands of men, horses and in the end even elephants, with the camera (or the cameras) moving right in the middle of the fighting whirl. The story of how this young king has built from the small kingdom of Macedonia (including Greece already conquered by his father)an empire that reached the borders of India is in fact here presented with great force, realism and credibility notwithstanding its fictional nature. The character of Alexander is very well performed by Colin Farrell. The narrative process is rather original but very effective anyway. It is Ptolemy, one of Alexander's immediate successors to whom the throne of Egypt was given after the emperor'r death, who, already an old man tells the whole story that develops itself before our eyes, to a group of young students. This movie must be seen by everyone who loves Cinema ans History simultaneously."

The movie may or may not be historically accurate but the way it's told with Anthony Hopkins as the narrator entering the mind and suspected reasoning of Alexander is powerful. How the movie is separated into sections of Alexander's history is great too, how his early life was defined by his relationship with his seemingly evil mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and his angry father, Philip (Val Kilmer) to his journey across the known worlds, all the way to his downfall.<br/><br/>NOTES: Did not like the scene that turned red when Alexander (Colin Farrell) fell.

","Just like Pearl Harbor, Razzie nominated director Oliver Stone sounded like a good choice as director for the story he spent fifteen years planning to make, but guess what? Basically this is the historical biopic about golden-haired Greek king and Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great (Razzie nominated Colin Farrell), ruling 356-323 B.C. Old Ptolemy (Sir Anthony Hopkins) narrates the story, as Alexander ascended to the thrown at the age of 20, after his father King Philip (Razzie nominated Val Kilmer) is murdered, waging war against the Persians. After finding out it may have been his own mother Olympias (Razzie nominated Angelina Jolie) who was involved with his father's murder, he continues the war he started, stretching his Empire from Greece to India, only to die at age 32 from illness. Also starring Jared Leto as Hephaistion, Rosario Dawson as Roxane, Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Cassander, Brian Blessed as Wrestling Trainer, Tim Pigott-Smith as Omen Reader, Gary Stretch as Cleitus and David Bedella as Scribe. The action, war and bloody sequences are good viewing, and of course Dawson with no clothes on is a highlight, but the film is marred by its near three-hour length, the quality of acting from some of the cast, and the pathetic dialogue, so while the spectacle is fine, the overall result is terrible. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Adequate!"
"ajaxbardrick","4","2","3","22 November 2008"," Alexander the Minor
","For Oliver Stone to take on a project such as this took ambition that Alexander III himself would have recognised, but as with A.T.G.'s rampage thru the East it all ends in failed disillusionment.<br/><br/>Things that worked: Angelina J. as Olympias; Stretch as Cleitus; Kilmer as Philip II (despite the handicap of questionable make up); the central battle sequence at Guagamela with A.T.G. leading the cavalry back to the centre to go for old Darius himself, the death of Cleitus.<br/><br/>(This is a short list for a film seeking to punch as big as this). <br/><br/>(A few) things that didn't: <br/><br/>Poorly designed sets - where is the magnificence & oriental opulence of the royal palaces of Babylon? Why is Aristotle teaching the royal cubs sitting amidst a stack of 1/2 broken classical Greek columns (they may be broken today but 2,300 years ago they'd just been put up)?<br/><br/>Cheap looking costumes - everyone in Macedon walks around wearing robes that look like an advert for a soap detergent they are so dazzlingly white, and towards the film's end the costumes increasingly begin to resemble the outfits worn by English ""glam rock"" bands in the 1970's, complete with eye-liner? Who thought that this was a good look for the film's subject?<br/><br/>Farrell, good in the occasional scene (death of Cleitus, confrontation with Olympias after his father's murder) but lacking the stature as a player for the main role here, also lacks the classically proportioned good looks that are needed and the lack of a bright colour in the eyes for the close ups is a visual hindrance. Ollie Stone's penchant for young wild cards paid off with Charlie Sheen in the 80's, but not this time.<br/><br/>The all Irish casting for the Macedonians (apart from Stretch). Daring and interesting, but has the effect of making them at moments resemble a crowd of excited hobbits from ... well, another recent film. <br/><br/>Sub-standard casting aside from the main role. Apart from Cleitus, where are the Macedonian lions who stamped themselves over the last chapter of the book of the glory of Greece: Hephaestion (a disaster by Leto, see his bronze in the Prado in Madrid for the real man), Ptolemy (a blank with a questionable hair style - that goes for both ""old"" & ""young""), the rest of the Diadochi barely put in an appearance. Where's the swagger and the cut and dash and danger of this young Macedonian aristocratic elite pack taking on the world and knowing that no one that they're facing can compete with them? Parmenion lacking the gravitas that the old man has from the echo of him in the histories, Chris Plummer and Hopkins wasted, Plummer thrown away merely on a context setting historical lecture, and A.H., wearing another of those glow white togas, trapped in an awful set consisting of plastic classical fake marble and pot plants, having to read out a script of contextual history tie ups to explain loose ends that could have been written as a part of a school project. <br/><br/>A poor script, 2nd rate writing mangling an inherently dramatic story by a mixture of poor selection of events left in & out, and a lack of a writer's vision as to a clear and effective narrative theme; A.T.G. is reduced half way thru to being Ollie Stone's ideal of a 1/2 cut J.F.K. of the classical period with musings of how what he's doing is for the freedom of the world (something that might raise an eyebrow or 2 amidst the now dust of the denizens of Tyre & Gaza (332 BC) and the Greeks who opposed Alexander at Granicus (334 BC).<br/><br/>A Director ""out of his knowledge"". Where are the sweeping vistas and panoramas of the passage from Europa, thru Asia Minor and the husk of the fallen might of Egypt, on into the arid airy beauty of Persia and then beyond to the exotic mystery of the lushness of the sub-continent? Where is the magnificence of the entry to Babylon with its terrified and yet also indifferent mass of citizenry watching on as these Europeans walk into their capital upending everything that these people known as an established order for more than a millennium. Where is Persepolis in its breath defying blue white pureness, and its great ending in answer to Xerxes? Ollie Stone made his reputation with small up close & personal films such as ""Wall Street"" and ""J.F.K."" examining elements of the underbelly of W.A.S.P. Amerika, and at that he's 2nd to none, but with ""Alexander"" he took a deep breath and boldly stepped out of his comfort zone ... and thereby revealed his limitations. <br/><br/>He ""over-reached"", not unlike a young fellow from who came out of Pella a long time ago."
"writerasfilmcritic","4","2","3","28 September 2008"," Except for the Bedroom Scene with Rosario Dawson, the Remake of Alexander Doesn't Measure Up to the Original with Richard Burton
","And that about says it all. I've begun to read several of the comments that say this is a great movie and that one must be intelligent enough or well-read enough to appreciate it, but hey, I know pretense when I see it and this movie is pretentious. Oliver Stone is a gifted director who has done several interesting projects, but at the same time, he has gained a rep for playing fast and loose with inconvenient facts for the sake of dramatization. Where is the historical justification for painting Alexander as a fairy? Clearly, in this flick, he is depicted as just that. You can dress it up or excuse it all you want, but in my book, his best buddy and he were a couple of fruits no matter how you slice it. In the original ""Alexander"" with Richard Burton, the Oedipal relationship with his mother was explored in detail, including it's effect on his relationship with his father. In that movie, they were more directly tied to the murder of Philip. But although he had a lifelong friend whom he ended up killing for making drunken insults, there was nobody with whom he was constantly hugging or gazing lovingly into one another's eyes, and most certainly, no male dancer whom he kissed and sauntered off to bed with. As such, that movie was a better one.<br/><br/>Strangely, the wedding night scene with Rosario Dawson is one of the most erotic sequences I've seen in some time. Man, is she put together nicely. I had to wonder how this emotional, fruity guy was able to conquer most of the known world and suddenly become the stud of the week with this hot young Persian chick, but somehow, Farrell pulled it off, even though it didn't make much sense. Had the rest of this overblown flick been that good, I'd be giving it a ten rather than a four. I also thought the sound track was interesting but pretentious. I liked the part where he tamed the big horse immediately, but knew the beautiful animal was going to die at some point and was sad to see it when it finally happened, although I wondered how the same horse made it unscathed from his childhood into his twenties, where it carried him through countless battles. It was also peculiar that this person, who was depicted as becoming a ruthless tyrant, could inspire his armies to such dramatic achievements. Nonetheless, some of the battle footage was quite good, if as others have said, it was often confusing. Why they put the assassination sequence of Philip toward the end of the movie, I'm not sure, for it was important to the development of the story. <br/><br/>Otherwise, ""Alexander"" had some interesting aspects and I can't join those who feel that it was a complete waste of time. The story is certainly deserving of a serious, historically accurate rendering, and I'm surprised that so many claim that this version is just that. It was too confusing and disjointed, plus all the allusions to homosexuality, together made it a somewhat failed effort. Frankly, Colin Farrell is no Richard Burton. In my opinion, Stone should have explored the relationship between Alexander and Roxanne a great deal more. As I said, there were some real sparks flying between Farrell and Dawson, whom I think did an excellent job as the beautiful Persian temptress. As for Farell's gay lover, no thanks, not interested, and I don't believe there is any solid historical basis for it. These Hollywood guys, these days, surrounded by gay men, seem to think they have to put that crap in just about every movie, justified or not. I'd say that's got a lot more to do with this particular interpretation of Alexander's sexuality than anything else. Stone should have left it out."
"onepotato2","2","2","3","15 April 2008"," Bewildered
","I'm trying not to pile on here. But this movie lost it's way so frequently that I was left with two questions. What was Stone hoping t achieve? and, Who on earth was the target audience? Stone just revived the antiquated swords-and-sandals epic formula and popped in some gay nuzzling. Structurally it's really a mess; it has flashbacks within flashbacks (Directors Cut) At various points I thought ""I'm really ready for this to become interesting."" But no it just soldiered on into obscurity.<br/><br/>Two words: ""Blond Wig"" Why on earth do you cast a dark brunette in the role of a golden blond god that then requires using awful wigs, and leaves Ferrell with thick black eyebrows? Ferrell may be hot but he's just not golden."

Specially Colin Farrel and Gary Stretch in the scene when Alexander kills Cleitus. It is an excellent scene with great realism, I was surprised. Cleitus was an interesting character too and I missed to see more about his life.<br/><br/>Another of my favorite scenes is when Alexander enters to Babylon in his glory moment.

","Having seen the Richard Burton over emoted version of ""Alexander the Great"" from back in the fifties I was not sure what I would fine in the newer version. I must say I was easily spellbound. Collin Farrell and Jared Leto led an all star cast in the best rendition of the story of the first great military genius in history.<br/><br/>The settings were grand, the costumes perfect, the sound score excellent, but it was the work of the writers, Director Oliver Stone and the actors that made this story come alive.<br/><br/>The bigots that saw the film, I am sure, were unable to stomach the relationship of Alexander and Hephaistion, but they need to get over it. It is historical, it happened. Phillip was a bully and a drunkard, a bit of a blow hard, always talking big plans, but never advancing them until it was too late for him. But as Shakespeare said, when talking about one of his characters Alexander embodied ""all of the elements mixed in him that should cry out and say to the world 'this was a man!'"" I rate this one 10 out of 10 and only wish I could go higher!"

Come on Angelina cannot be that guy's mother even if she had bore him at 15. We all know Greek's had a different view of sexual preferences but this just does not make sense Patroclous was not Achilles cousin either so why should we focus on Alexander's love life and not in his campaign. The only thing worth seeing is the depiction of the Persian cities the rest is trash."
"dnecia","5","2","3","2 July 2006"," Nice movie,but if you want Histroy better go read some book
","I've just seen Alexander for the second time trying to avoid any emotional judgment and trying to be as fair as possible.My knowledge of history is on a good so i'll focus more on that point rather than the technical details of shooting that i'm not familiar with.<br/><br/>I understand that it's a movie so the lack of many historical events is normal. But there were two events that played a major role in Alexander's life and should be referred and these are the cut of the Gordian knot and the visit to the Aegyptian Priests in desert(there's only a small reference). There are some events that are wrong like that his horse died in battle rather than to age, i think the battle tactic that was used in Gavgamela was used in the battle of Granicus and that he went for swimming and then went sick rather than drinking in a fest while flirting to other men. And that's my second point.It's time for people to know that homosexuality existed in ancient Greece,but not in the terms of nowadays. Many times boys were given to men who taught them about life in many aspects or in some cities soldiers fought as pair during fights in order to have a stronger attention one to another.Anyways, that portrait of Alexander was not based in none historical reference but it's interpreted to today's terms. That goes a lot for the portraits of Olympias and Phillip, who is shown a as drunk, useless barbarian general, while on the contrary he was on of the aspirators of the unifying of Greece. And that thing with Olympias and the snakes in every shot of her?I honestly can't recall any reference that tells anything about it. A third point. In the movie it's being referred Macedonia and Greece. That's not quite correct cause Macedonia(which consisted of the area of Macedonia in Greece, parts of F.Y.R.O.M., Albania and Bulgaria) was part of the Greek nation, just like they were the Atheneans, the Spartans, the Thebeans etc. So why did they try to present like Macedonia is something different from Greece?I would like to remind you that Macedoneans spoke the same language, believed in the same Gods and considered themselves Greek-that's the whole point of the unified Greece. To sum up, i think that as a movie wasn't that bad-with nice direction,good photography and actors (except to Colin Farrel of course,cause he didn't look at all like Alexander who was short and very young- but as far as it concerns for the historic point of view i would suggest to better go and read Arrianus who is one of the best historians who describe Alexander's life."

"andthats","4","2","3","4 August 2005"," What's Everyone Else On About!?
","Seriously, i watched this film last night and now i'm on IMDb reading a lot of the reviews, and all of you seem to be missing the point! People seem to be giving this film high ratings mainly out of anger at low ratings it got from critics or other IMDb users! The amount of 10 out of 10's at the top of the review page is quite frankly ridiculous. You can't rate a film this high simply because it's overall mark is lower that what you might want it to be. Other people have ranked it highly because it's historically accurate and true to the source material, but this once again does not warrant a high rating. The question should simply be, IS THIS FILM ACTUALLY ANY GOOD:<br/><br/>Well the answer, sadly, is no. The reasons, (and i won't patronise anyone here by going into how historically accurate it may be, or whether it was too homo-erotic or not) are as follows: It was poorly directed, and lacked any connection with the audience on an emotional or even purely adrenaline fuelled level. The battle scenes had no punch to them, and were in fact quite confusing. No heart pounding scenes of horror like at the beginning of gladiator. The final death scene was just boring, and i didn't really care enough about Alexander to give a damn anyway, unlike Maximus in Gladiator which definitely tugged on the heart strings.<br/><br/>The editing is just down right slapstick, i'm still not really sure if it was just rushed or Oliver was playing with some stylised idea, but it jumps around almost haphazardly. I am not simply talking about the flashbacks either! Many times the next scene will start right on the back of the old one and your mind has to catch up to whats going on, with a completely different mood to the scene.<br/><br/>The acting i will not comment on as i'm sure some people will love it and others may not, and i really want this to be an objective review!<br/><br/>Now here comes the worst part of the film for me. The soundtrack!! What is that i hear you say, the soundtrack? Well yes, you did hear me correctly, and i'm not simply talking about the music itself, which is terrible, but where it is placed in the film. For me, it single handedly manged to destroy the mood of almost every scene in the film, and i think many of the scenes would have had a bigger impact if just left silent(as in no score). The music is horribly cheesy, there isn't really much more i can say about it without starting to rant. As for when they use it, in the first battle scene the score sounds like it should be played after they have won the battle, as victory music, rather that during the battle, and makes the whole seen seem somewhat contrived.<br/><br/>The last part has to be the accents. Anyone who's seen the film knows whats coming...HOW FUNNY WAS THAT!!!! Angela was transylvanian or something, and almost everyone else was Irish!!!!!! Why is this, to hide Collin Farrels accent? He does a pretty good job of a Texan accent in tigerland so trying to find a neutral English accent shouldn't be too hard for him. The accents just added to take any real sense of realism from the film, and though it maybe accurate it felt more like a popcorn flick than an historical epic, which is ultimately why it must be reviewed so harshly!<br/><br/>I give this film a 4 out of 10, and those 4 i've given are because of its historical accuracy, and because the director had the balls to not shy away from scenes that many may consider to 'Gay' for the big screen, whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. Alas, i am sorry Oliver, but these facts alone cannot save what is ultimately a poor effort.<br/><br/>Note: (Please Read) As for the comparisons to King Arthur i read, and how people can't believe Alexander could get a lower mark, let me explain. King Arthur is terrible, i mean atrocious, and that is what ultimately saves it. It's so bad, it ends up becoming a parody and a comedy! I was laughing so hard in the cinema, and just had to get some of my friends together and go see it again. I mean what a load of tosh, but maybe disguised genius, like John Woo's Windtalkers. Did these directors actually want to make films this bad? Probably not, but i for one had lots of fun watching these films through there crapness, and came out bubbling. I came it of Alexander feeling totally indifferent, unaffected. My English teacher once told me that you can love something or hate it and that means that it has worked in someway, that it is a success. But if you only feel indifference, then it has done nothing and is the most abject of failures. Think about it!"

","Let me start by saying i have only seen the directors cut and no the original theatrical release. By the time i got to see the film the dust had settled from all the critics ripping the film to pieces, there attention was turned to the disappointing War of the Worlds, which is another story!<br/><br/>I so badly wanted to like this film as i am a fan of Stone and felt that an epic on the scale of the Alexander story could only be a good thing, unfortunately no matter how hard i tried i could not find the film at all interesting as it was extremely muddled, cutting from the present to the past and skipping bits of the story only to be filled in later! Along with this flaw is the fact that all the internal scenes look so staged that it takes all plausibility that these men were in ancient times away.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was dreadful (Farrell was not as bad as Clive Owen in King Arthur though) Jolie was well over the top and her accent was so out of place, where is she supposed to be from? All the characters were supposed to be Greek or Macedonian yet they were Irish! It had some great acting talent like Anthony Hopkins, Val Kilmer and Jared Leto in it but not even they could do anything to save this utter disappointment. The battle scenes did nothing for me as i felt no real involvement in any of the characters as they were so underdeveloped. The film as a whole feels like it had too much to say and not enough time to say it, i think 6 hours of film would not be able to fit it all in. Overall then i was extremely disappointed with a film, that i thought, could not fail. 5/10"
"sveknu","3","2","3","19 July 2005"," The most wasted budget in movie history
","I really mean it. The story of Alexander the Great is an interesting one to be told. Also, I tend to like movies from the antiquity. My favourite movie, ""The Gladiator"", got me into it. Even though ""Troy"" disappointed me, I still had hopes for this one, but it tended to be worse in every aspect. Where ""Troy"" still was a mediocre movie, ""Alexander"" sucks on every level. First of all, the action-sequences in movies like this are important. I don't know exactly what it was, but the action in this movie didn't excite me one bit. It was rather dull and uninteresting. One scene in India is rather OK, but that's it. The story is also VERY boring. I know that this is a true story and all, but it actually is possible to make it more exciting. And what about the ""boys wanna be with boys""-suggestions considering Alexander? That should've been completely removed from the movie. I fully understand that this movie was banned in Greece. Who want their national hero turned in to a rather tragic, femi-like idiot? None. And the actors portraying Alexander and his mother are nearly at the same age. Give me a break, people."

","Some of the movies special effects were terrific. Many battle overviews were too computer distracting. Another distraction was the lack of the ability of the general cast. I found that the British actors, as Greek soldiers, could not hide there strong British accents. They also over played the homo aspect of Alexander. That part of ancient Greek culture although true, could have been left out. Movie makers often leave true facts out of movies. They should have done so with this movie. Because of that particular realism I found it impossible to be a a good family film. I would not bring anyone under age 17 to it. Otherwise I found the movie slightly entertaining."

EDITING YOUR FILM TO COWTOW TO THE CONSERVATIVE REACTION OF THE MASSES? <br/><br/>After spending the interview railing about the conservative climate of America right now, (rightfully)deriding those who couldn't handle what is already a subtle and almost under the radar screen relationship, he is now saying that in order to satisfy the home video market, he's going to TWEAK (READ: SANITIZE, DE-GAY, RE-EDIT, CLEAN UP, CAVE IN) the theatrical version for home video???? There are so many things wrong with this sentiment I don't know where to begin. First of all, a director of Stone's caliber who has weathered every known cinematic controversy is going to do a reversal and issue a more subtle version of his distinctly personal vision? We certainly didn't see this with the director's cuts of any of his other films, which wound up on DVD (Ashley Judd's pencil in the neck extra on the NBK DVD not withstanding) in their unexpurgated forms. <br/><br/>Mr. Stone, after spending nearly 30 years to make this film which is, as you have described, ""the epic of your life,"" please tell me you're not saying that you're compromising your (flawed) work to satisfy critical reception and the concerns of the home video consumer? Are you being studio pressured to make changes to the film for the DVD? I understand there was already a cut of the film approximately 45 minutes LONGER than your 173 minute cut, shown to an LA journalist prior to your trims that were made for Warner Bros. in November (discussed by you in Entertinment Weekly, and supposedly containing gay kissing scenes shot but unable to be used). <br/><br/>There can be nothing else deduced here than Stone has completely lost his mind (he appeared on The View to promote the film, for crying out loud)if he, as one of the few radical remaining American filmmakers, can't take the heat for this film and let it lie. Every great filmmaker has one misfire. His Alexander is a grand, lurid, feverish, decadent piece of convoluted and silly mishmash that has a lot more going for it than anyone wants to admit -- it's a movie about the sum of its parts, not the coherent whole. But I can't stomach that Stone is second-guessing his vision to satisfy the tastes of critics and audiences. Alexander is what it is -- or what it is not -- leave it alone, or if you're going to make changes, go back and edit the film you wanted prior to Warner tinkering just before release. For heaven's sake (or Zeus', as it were), don't put your tail between your legs and scissor the film at this point, removing the essence of the few intimate scenes that actually work. <br/><br/>Gravely concerned in Chicago."

","I saw this movie at a free screening because I love Oliver Stone. I had heard horrible things about it so I was prepared for the worst. It wasn't awful, but it certainly had a lot of unintentionally hilarious moments. It seems Stone wasn't able to go fullboard with the gay theme, so there are many laughable double entendres and longing looks. I won't ruin them for you by telling you what they are so you can enjoy them yourself. Also, Colin Farrell looks and sounds like an Irish escapee from a heavy metal concert- really bad blonde hair and there's something just not very epic about him. He has one particularly unfortunate moment where he yells something about the GLORRRRRRYY! at which most of the people in my screening guffawed. The landscapes, scenery, and epic battle scenes are very engrossing. Babylon looks likes an acid dream, which seems appropriate for an Oliver Stone movie. The oddest thing is everyone's different accents. Though the acting for the most part is very good, the hodgepodge of speech patterns actually overshadows it. Most of the Greeks and Macedonians speak in Irish and English accents, but then Jared Leto sounds like a Californian and Angelina Jolie- well, let's just say she may have discovered a new accent. Over all though, this film offers a great escape from reality, and is quite enjoyable in its own weird way.This may be what we've come to in this era of censorship- an Oliver Stone movie so constrained in its content that it becomes unintelligible, and unintentionally comedic."

","It is not easy to defend a film that is criticized wildly by many. But in order to understand Alexandre's controversies, we must first turn to director Oliver Stone's filmography. Whenever he made a film based on real events (Nascido em 4 de Julho / The Doors / JFK / Nixon / W. / As Torres Gêmeas), the director always sought to put more emphasis on his opinion on the subject than simply show the facts. It is difficult to say who Alexander the Great was. Some will say that he was the greatest conqueror of all time. The greatest military general. Others will say that he was simply a tyrant. There are also those who will say that despite his arrogance and brutality, Alexander was a dreamy and visionary man. For Oliver Stone, Alexandre was all of that and more. Lasting 3 hours, the film shows unapologetically the relationship of Alexandre (Colin Farrel) with his parents, Queen Olympia (Angelina Jolie) and Filipi (Val Kilmer). The relationship between the three is explosive, but exciting. The film follows the style ""Ascension and decadence"", and immerses us deeply not only in Alexander's victories and defeats but in his personal life. It is not really an easy to assimilate film. Many, they will say will call the film exaggerated, shameful, but in reality it is an ambitious film and very, very brave.<br/><br/>Film seen on the 25th to the 26th of March 2020"

It doesn't take away the brilliant strategist he may have been (to inspire all the great strategists who followed him), nor the greatness of his exploits and of the character himself.

The film really feels like a drag at points, but what really makes this film bad, is the acting. It's beyond terrible. This movie's version of drama is yelling at each other. And it feels like a crappy stage-play, or a silent film with sound. As in a play, the actors have to scream so the audience can hear them, but this is a movie, so that's not an issue.

"hitchcockthelegend","7","1","1","22 June 2019"," Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut.
","Alexander is directed by Oliver Stone and Stone co-writes the screenplay with Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis. It stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Anthony Hopkins, Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Christopher Plummer. Music is by Vangelis and cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.<br/><br/>Alexander is an historical epic based on the life of Alexander the Great.
Off the bat I have to say that this ""Final Cut"" version of the film is the only one I have seen. Upon its initial home format release - the first theatrical version - I lasted an hour and 15 minutes before growing restless and sought enjoyment elsewhere. Consequently as a massive fan of historical epics through the years, it has been a constant nagging itch for me to see Alexander in its entirety. So with Oliver Stone tinkering away with versions - convinced he has made a worthwhile epic - I finally delved in.<br/><br/>The Final Cut, as far as I'm aware, is a vast improvement on that savagely received theatrical release, well that is said by those who tried again instead of calling quits at the first production. Straight away I could see the difference, where once was a plodding first hour, now sits a vibrancy, with Stone seemingly saying that he can do great action and drama, just please hang around during all the historical chatter, sexual connotation, family strife and conquering machinations, and I will enthral you as a whole.<br/><br/>By his own admission, Stone reveals he took on a most complex historical character and in his eyes has made a film to befit such complexity. We get a splintered narrative, as we kick off with the crux of Alexander the Great, the leader, while Alexander's childhood and family forming is interspersed at various junctures. The battles are high in intensity and blood letting - exhilarating at times - but more crucially they let us engage with the tactical ""ahead of their time"" manoeuvres of Alexander the Great. This version mostly flows alright, and I got to feel how Alexander's mind was working in the process, even if come pics closure I didn't fully know the man.<br/><br/>Epically cast of course, some of them work, others not so much. Farrell's looked odd, in the way that Pitt's was in Troy (released this same year as Alexander), but apart from the accent issue he grows into the role and is fiercely committed. Jolie is just wrong for the role of domineering Olympias, worse still the scenes she does with Farrell are damp and threaten to derail the drama already built up. This latter point is more annoying given a great thread involving Dawson as Alexander's wife Roxanne is built up superbly, only to not be pulled until some drama very late in the play. The rest of the cast come through as ok for period flavours (expected for Hopkins, Plummer and Meyers, interesting as regards Leto).<br/><br/>This is not the life ambition masterpiece Stone wanted to make, even if he proclaims on the extras that he's happy and content with The Final Cut version. This cut still shows some cracks, but these are not seismic enough to hurt the film. For there's a lot of grandeur, blood stirring and thought gone into the production, and there's a lot to be said for that in this day and age of soulless cash making filmic exercises. Honourable failure then? Yes for sure, but a better film in this form than some may have thought possible back in 2004. 7/10"

He would take his men from Macedonia to conquer the rest of the known world and beyond.<br/><br/>Aside from all of the historical inaccuracies, this movie is missing the greatness from Alexander the Great. It tries to do so much that it doesn't have any heart. The characters lack any real blood or substance. It feels like a very long, slightly confused high school history lesson. The use of Hopkins to recount the story also subtracts from the immediacy. There are some big action scenes but Oliver Stone doesn't do so well with the characters.

"tomsview","4","1","1","29 January 2013"," Alexander gets Stoned
","Oliver Stone's strategy for bringing the great Macedonian conqueror to life in his $150 million movie was flawed from the start, and Alexander the Great, who was never beaten in battle, went down in defeat yet again on the screen.<br/><br/>Apparently this is the movie that Oliver Stone always wanted to make. He even had Robert Rossen's stilted 1956 film, ""Alexander the Great"" to show the pitfalls to avoid. However he may not have done his homework because many of the elements that let down the earlier film do the same thing to this one.<br/><br/>The story covers Alexander's life from boyhood until his death in Persia, but his life was so intertwined with the politics of ancient Greece that Stone needed a way to help the audience understand what was happening. He decided on narration by Anthony Hopkins who plays one of Alexander's generals, however it makes the movie feel old-fashioned from the start.<br/><br/>The relationship between Alexander and his mother, Olympus, played by Angelina Jolie, and with his father, Philip of Macedon, played by Val Kilmer, is explored ad nauseum, and it all becomes rather tedious. Finally and fatally, Colin Farrell does not project enough power or charisma to make you believe he could lead men across the road to the pub let alone on a campaign to conquer the world.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie went to town on her character. Weighed down with snakes and large earrings, plus an accent seemingly inspired by Natasha Fatale of ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" fame, she delivers an over-the-top performance, which also helps knock the movie off balance.<br/><br/>After his father's death, Alexander leads the Greeks and Macedonians into Persia to complete what he believes is his destiny. Stone waits until the battle of Gaugamela in Persia before he unleashes an awesome spectacle – the film needed more of this. Instead, when screen time isn't taken up with the politics, it is taken up with Alexander's pursuit of young men. Not only does Stone present us with the concept of a brotherhood of warriors along the lines of the Gay Mardi Gras Recovery Party, but Alexander pursues just about anything in a loincloth.<br/><br/>That's not to say the film has no female love interest because Alexander can march in any direction – his encounter with Rosario Dawson as Roxanne is a very hot scene. Not only that, but there is definitely subtext in Alexander's relationship with his mother. That's a lot of R&R for one soldier.<br/><br/>Although the movie is long, it seems longer. Unfortunately, after Alexander's spectacular entry into Babylon, the story meanders – we are told about Alexander's conquests but we don't actually see them. Finally, as Alexander approaches the Indus River and the gateway to India, he faces his toughest battle. The Macedonians encounter an Indian army, which employs elephants like M1 Abrams tanks. The fuzziness of Stone's thinking reveals itself when he uses a red filter during the battle. An effect such as this was probably passé by the late 60's – now, it's just annoying. However, by this stage, the audience can't wait for it to end. This duly takes place after Alexander's death from disease.<br/><br/>The life of Alexander is well documented. Stone had plenty of material to draw on. He opted to concentrate on the politics and Alexander's tortured psyche rather than the campaigns of conquest that are the real reason for his enduring fame. Although too many battles would no doubt have caused audience battle fatigue, the movie lacks action.<br/><br/>For a while, Baz Lurman was also slated to direct a version of the mighty Macedonian's life. Although this now seems unlikely, if he ever does, maybe his quirky, full-throttle approach to filmmaking will finally see Alexander achieve the cinematic greatness that has so far eluded him."

For a couple of centuries after his death, he was still worshiped as a god.<br/><br/>You also needed to have an actor who had that sense of arrogance, self-entitlement - not a bad boy - but someone who felt he had the right to own the world because he did.<br/><br/>And only Jude Law (circa 1999) could have pulled that feat off."
"tahroja","2","1","1","4 September 2012"," Tried too hard
","First off, having read earlier ratings I have to address that Alexander was NOT gay, bisexual or whatever-sexual. It's highly anachronistic to claim that, as these categories did not exist in his days. Men having intimate relationships with other men was a common practice, but those engaging in it did not identify as gay or bi, just like those who only had sex with women did not identify as straight. It's extremely anachronistic to claim that Alexander was gay or bi, even though his intimate relationships with other men are a historical fact. The relationship between him and Jared Leto's character therefore cannot be called homosexual. Categories based on sexual preference are a modern phenomenon, and in earlier times intercourse between people of the same sex would have simply been called sodomy (with varying levels of tolerance). Now that I've gotten that off my chest, it's time to move on to the actual review.<br/><br/>While I can definitely appreciate the attempt to take on a fresh view of Alexander and am all for ""shocking"" and revolutionary takes on historical figures, this movie just didn't do it for me. Others before me have already put everything into words better than I ever could, so I'll just summarize: Angelina Jolie was perhaps the most confusing character in the history of movies, Colin Farrel was bland, the acting and the dialog were planky and forgettable (not to mention the accents) and the entire plot seemed rushed and superficial. Plus Jared Leto looked like a fifteen-year-old emo girl, but that might just be me...<br/><br/>I enjoy historical drama (even when it's not completely accurate - if a viewer takes a movie for actual history he only has himself to blame) but I feel that the team of Alexander just tried too hard to create a larger-than-life epic, and on the quest for grandeur ended up sacrificing many qualities that would have made this movie a better one."
"JamesHitchcock","5","1","1","15 January 2011"," Not a Natural-Born Subject for Oliver Stone
","Although Alexander the Great had a distinguished military career, historians generally agree that he took no active part in the Vietnam War. He never served as President of the United States, and not even the barmiest conspiracy theorists have tried to implicate him in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. So what is Oliver Stone doing making a film about him? ""Alexander"" was the third and last film in the brief revival of the Classical epic in the early 2000s. (The other two were ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy""). The film tells the story of Alexander's life- his boyhood in Macedon, his difficult relationship with his father King Philip, his accession to the throne at the age of 20 following Philip's assassination, his war of conquest against the Persian Empire, his relationship with his close friend Hephaestion, and his death at the age of only 33. The story is narrated by Ptolemy, one of Alexander's close associates and generals who went on to found the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.<br/><br/>The film was made in the style of the grand epics of the fifties and early sixties; another film about Alexander, starring Richard Burton, was made in 1956. Stone, however, was able to deal with a subject which would have been taboo during that period; the relationship between Alexander and Hephaestion is presented as a homosexual one. This caused some controversy at the time, but while there is no direct evidence that the two men were lovers in the sexual sense, they were undoubtedly devoted friends and lived in a culture in which gay relationships were generally regarded as acceptable. A sexual relationship between them, therefore, is by no means out of the question.<br/><br/>Another controversial issue was the way in which Alexander's campaign against the Persians is compressed into a single battle. Alexander actually won three major victories against the Persian armies, but only the last of these, the Battle of Gaugamela, is shown. This is not, however, a fault in my view. To have given the battles of the Granicus and Issus the same treatment as Gaugamela would have made for a more historically accurate film, but not necessarily for a better one. It would, moreover, have stretched an already over-extended budget to breaking-point and would have made a film which already stretches to nearly three hours even longer.<br/><br/>The film failed at the American box office and was not much liked by the critics; its failure brought an end to the brief epic revival, just as the failures of ""Cleopatra"" and ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" put an end to the original epic cycle in the mid-sixties. It was even nominated for several Razzies. Although it has some high points, such as the battle scenes, I would largely agree with the critics; I would not rank it as highly as ""Gladiator"" or even ""Troy"". Colin Farrell, although his acting is better than his ""Worst Actor"" nomination might suggest, does not make a very charismatic hero- certainly not in the same class as Russell Crowe. Admittedly, Farrell has a rather difficult task; twenty-first century audiences are perhaps unlikely to warm to a man who launches a bloody war of conquest out of motives of personal vanity. None of the other cast members stand out, and Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother Olympias seems particularly miscast, being only a year older than Farrell himself.<br/><br/>Yet there is, I think, another, more basic, reason for the film's failure; it lacks conflict. That might seem an odd criticism to make of a film much of which is taken up with warfare, but I was using the word in its dramatic rather than its military sense. Compared with some Hollywood distortions of history, ""Alexander"" is a relatively accurate depiction of its hero's life, but there are times when history can benefit by being fictionalised. Thus in ""Gladiator"", Ridley Scott turns the story of the historical Emperor Commodus into a classic revenge plot by inserting the fictional hero Maximus, and in ""Troy"" Wolfgang Petersen, while reinterpreting the traditional version of the Greek myth to make it more relevant for modern times, keeps the various conflicts (Greeks v Trojans, Achilles v Agamemnon, etc.) which lay at the heart of the original story.<br/><br/>There is no similar dramatic conflict at the heart of ""Alexander"". Although the Greeks are fighting the Persians, there is no attempt to explore the causes of the war (other, perhaps, than Alexander's own ego), and the Persian King Darius is a relatively minor figure. The film often seems less like a drama than like an academic history lecture, with Anthony Hopkins's Ptolemy cast in the role of the dusty lecturer vainly struggling to prevent his students from falling asleep. It is not particularly bad by Razzie standards- it is certainly far better than the awful ""Natural Born Killers"", by far Stone's worst movie, but neither is it particularly interesting. Stone has never really struck me as a natural born epic film-maker; most of his best films (""Salvador"", ""Wall Street"", ""Heaven and Earth"") have, even if set against major historical events, concentrated on the lives of ordinary men and women. ""Alexander"" lacks the dramatic power necessary for the success of epic movie, and lacks the emotional intimacy of its director's best films.

","Alexander the Great is perhaps one of the most well-known historical figures. His life has been recorded in detail by so many historians, and his exploits legendary. Considered divine during his lifetime, conquering a vast territory unrivaled until the Roman Empire...living a life reckless life...dying under mysterious circumstances -- a larger than life character.<br/><br/>Sounds like it would make a really epic movie, don't it? A perfect addition to the line of big-budget epics so prevalent in the early 2000s. Filmed in locations spanning three continents, featuring a cast that includes Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer, costing over $155 million to make, and with the acclaimed director of ""JFK"" and ""Platoon"" -- it seemed like this would be the perfect film, a return to the glory of films like ""Ben-Hur.""<br/><br/>And yet it was a critical and commercial failure upon release.<br/><br/>What went wrong?<br/><br/>One problem is perhaps the use of accents. They range from the Irish/Scottish accents of Colin Farrell and other actors playing Macedonians to the most lambasted of all -- the pseudo-Eastern European accent of Angelina Jolie. I understand that this is a technique by Oliver Stone to distinguish each culture. The problem is, it can be quite distracting. The accents perhaps aren't TOO bad as to ruin the whole movie, and can be ignored.<br/><br/>Then there's the narration. Now, Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor, and he is superb as an elderly Ptolemy narrating events from Alexander's life. His voice can be heard in this film a lot. However, ***perhaps too much***. There are some scenes where the narration is just not necessary or would be more effective without it. The old saying is, ""Show...don't tell."" This is a drama, not a documentary.<br/><br/>Another problem is the way Alexander's story is told. It does resemble a cliché melodrama, from the gay romance between Alexander and Hephaestion to the soap-opera family relationship between Alexander, his parents -- these should have been handled more carefully. A primary antagonist would have helped. Some characters are worth expanding upon (Darius, Roxanne). I personally didn't feel for any of the characters in this film -- whether to root for them or not.<br/><br/>And this brings us to another major problem in the film -- the portrayal of the main character, Alexander himself.<br/><br/>This film does attempt to make him into an complex, three-dimensional character. One can admire the filmmakers for doing that. Here, he is portrayed as an idealist, seeking to unite all the peoples and cultures of the world under a reign of tolerance and diversity. In the scene where he conquers Babylon, Alexander benevolently shows mercy to Darius' daughter (""that's how you'll be treated - a princess""). He is actually likable in that scene. <br/><br/>However, in trying to portray Alexander as complex, the filmmakers do go overboard with the soap-opera aspects. Alexander does seem like a wuss in some scenes. When he's criticized by one of his men, he goes into a temper tantrum (""Arrest him! Arrest him!""). Surely, a person of Alexander's reputation and esteem would sound more intimidating and commanding, not whiny. Such whininess reaches its peak during the death of Hephaestion scene. Alexander resembles a modern-day drama queen or emo kid.<br/><br/>Based on what historians say about the real Alexander, this movie counterpart should have been portrayed more as a modern-day jock. There should have should more scenes that show just what made him Alexander the GREAT.<br/><br/>These are what are perhaps the major flaws of ""Alexander"". But flaws aside, there is much to love (okay, LIKE) about this movie.<br/><br/>The actors are generally good, even Angelina (never mind the accent). It was nice to see Christopher Plummer as Aristole. And even Colin Farrell himself is actually decent. He may not be Oscar-material like some of the older actors, and he may not be the best choice to play Alexander, but he is adequate enough in the lead role (never mind the blonde wig).<br/><br/>There is some nice scenery in this film, like the majestic deserts of Asia lush jungles of India (actually, Thailand posing as India). The sets are nice, too. While the buildings in the Babylon scenes are clearly GCI and do look superficial, this movie has some excellent sets. The interiors of the Macedonian and Alexandrian palaces are beautiful, and the wall painting and mosaics are accurate. The sets and buildings in the Bactria and India, with their brown, earth walls and pillars, invoke the feel of that time and place.<br/><br/>The costumes are also nice, and they seem authentic. The armor, helmets, and equipment of Macedian/Greek and Persian soldiers during the Gaugamela Battle are elaborate and colorful. This movie shows many cultures, from the Macedonians, Greeks, Persians, etc., and numerous customs from these cultures -- from the dance of Alexander's future wife Roxanne and their wedding scene, the viewer is truly transported into a different time and place. <br/><br/>The battle scenes are very intense and pulse-pounding. Never mind that there are only TWO battle scenes, compared to the many battles fought by the real Alexander. The first battle depicted in this film, in Gaugamela, is very chaotic and confusing, and it has nice aerial shots. The battle in India is just as chaotic (even if the final confrontation between Alexander and the elephant may be bizarre and ridiculous).<br/><br/>There's also the score by Vangelis, which (despite maybe sounding a little formulatic) does sound nice.<br/><br/>In all, I was surprised to find out that I actually enjoyed ""Alexander"". Obviously, this is a flawed. Then again, it's not absolute trash either."

","What a disappointment! I love some Oliver Stone films, for instance Nixon which is a 10/10 awesome film, but this is very poor. It is worse than the very disappointing Robert Rossen version with Richard Burton.<br/><br/>My first criticism is it is extremely tedious. Second, it is ridiculous as Farrell seems so unable to alter his Irish accent that Stone bizarrely has other actors like Val Kilmer speaking in Irish accents too to make it appear this represents Greek! Insane! <br/><br/>My third major criticism is that Stone indulges is extremely pretentious direction. I am shocked that he thinks this makes it artistic, it only makes it annoying. Camera angles, editing, colour/black and white, symbolism etc are all used noticeably but have no meaning or dramatic purpose. They are not used cleverly just flashily and pointlessly. They fail to lift the boredom and only add to the inadequacy of the film."

","I don't want to beat a dead horse, so I'll just say I can't imagine why Oliver Stone made this movie. In the past, I've fancied I had some clue about his motives, but this one escapes me. Is it yet another journey into the psyche of the power-drunk? Whatever, it didn't work. If he wanted a political expose, he should have skipped the battles. But I'd have preferred that he skipped the philosophical discussions. After all, no one knows that there's any facts at all in that part. But if he'd shown how Greeks could defeat military forces many times their size, that would have been interesting. A lot of the realms Alexander conquered were degenerate and ready to topple. Stone could have shown that. But I think he was, not for the first time, self-indulgent. This is the movie he wanted to make and the world be damned. All I can say is ""not much fun to watch"". I'm seeing this movie after a series of excursions in ancient military history like 300 and Troy. All the proceeding were way more entertaining than this movie."

(I would just like to add in brackets that I never understood why Alexander's performer had to be dyed blonde. Why Angelina Jolie has to go about the place with snakes. Why it is so important that Alexander could have been bisexual, I thought it was already common knowledge that such sexual orientation was quite usual in those days. I'll stop here.) <br/><br/>If you haven't watched it already, watch only if you are an avid fan of Greek mythology/ history, and enjoy spectacular movies and fight scenes even without contents.

","Although featuring an impressive cast, this film was unnecessarily complicated featuring confusing plot contortions at every twist. Watching this film in a theater is not a recommendation of mine,the atmosphere was not pleasant as i was constantly warding off valets as they told me to get my feet off the chair in front. The music accompanying this abomination was also misplaced, sending harpy music into the fight scenes and heavy, dark music into the love scenes. they also over-play the fact that the main character is gay just a tad, getting him to hug and kiss men at every point. after drifting off several times in the first two hours of the film, I felt it winding down and when the screen went dark i was immensely relieved. I was however outraged that this was not the end, it was simply the interval half way through the film. I would have walked out then and there if it had not been for my companion that particular night that insisted we stay until the end and that it might improve. It didn't! I have a list of the worst films i have ever seen and this ranked second, just above the punisher, which was worse but refreshingly short. the constant drone of the narrator compliments Angelina Jolie's terrible acting skills."

Being a huge Oliver Stone fan i was a little let down from this movie, hoping that it would be better then Gladiator. When i began to watch it i noticed that it had great visuals and good music. Then after the slow three hours passed by i felt like i wasted my Saturday and my six buck's for admission. It wasn't until about a year later that i saw the movie again and kind of liked it. Sure it's not as epic as Gladiator or Troy, but it's kind of a rebel, where it's a journey. You kind of have to have too much time on your hands to enjoy this movie. Because it is slow and has some bad acting in it. in conclusion, if you want to waste a day on a movie that's not horrible then rent, not buy, Alexander"
"MLDinTN","6","1","1","9 January 2006"," Farrell not that great in this and the plot was too big...
","even for a three hour film. The story of Alexander the Great is an interesting one, but Stone begins when he is a young child and tries to fit all he can in 3 hours. I thought it made the film too broad and hard to follow in places since there are quite a few flashbacks. It would have been better, if the story had been narrowed. Maybe begin just as Alexander was named King and then follow him as he conquered the East.<br/><br/>One question I have after seeing this was did every man in 320 BC wear eyeliner? Was eyeliner even invented then? And Jolie is as hot as ever but was it possible for a woman to have flawless makeup at this time? I was also disappointed with the battle scenes. They were too choppy and not that great. The battles in Gladiator were much better. The blood was flying everywhere, but you just couldn't tell much about what was going on.<br/><br/>And the acting was not very good by anyone. I thought Farrell was pretty bad and I've liked him most of the movies he has done. And why did Jolie even bother with an accent. And she was the only one who tried to have an accent. We know they didn't speak English at this time, so why bother with fake accents.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: The story of Alexander that Stone wanted to tell would have been better if it was a 10 hour mini series on the history channel. He tries to tell to much in 3 hours, which makes the film seem disjointed with a lack of a central story. I don't think it was as good as Troy, and that wasn't that great either, so I don't recommend this one."
"ebiros2","4","1","1","23 October 2005"," Good movie done in bad taste
","This movie was mixture of good and bad. The good was pretty good portrayal of Alexander by Colin Farrel. Bad was that this movie had no class. Maybe the character of producers and a director shows. The DVD is a two disc set and both discs have movie in it, so it's a long movie. There's also a bonus material about the making of this movie. What kind of appalled me was cussing director Oliver Stone doing throughout the entire sequence. The girl who appeared in X2 was collecting $5 from every person who used foul language on the set. She would have made a fortune if she was in this movie.<br/><br/>Cinematography wasn't so good, set was over done with weired color scheme that conflicted with cloths actors were wearing, and the movie lacked the polished feel. It was almost like a rough cut.<br/><br/>The movie did tell the story of Alexander although it may be Oliver Stone's version, but after seeing it there was no satisfaction. Colin Farrel's acting was good, and that was the only saving grace for this movie."
"benc7ca","5","1","1","26 August 2005"," Alexander Conquers Stone
","It's impossible, at this late date, to review Alexander without first ""reviewing the reviews"". The storm of controversy, arising mostly from the United States with a supporting chorus from Greece itself , swirled around the sexuality of Alexander rather than the Oliver Stone movie. The reviews from the gay press condemned Stone for being too coy with Alexander's love life and the religious-right condemned him for being too explicit. Both are wrong. I declined to view the film in a theatre for the simple reason that I think we've forgotten how to make an historical epic and, in Oliver Stone's case, how to direct one. I don't think he knew what audience he was playing to: the largely a-historical audience to whom the film might as well have been about aliens, or to people familiar with both Alexander the Great AND Alexander the Myth. To the former, he provides mind-numbing detail and names, for which they have no use. To the latter, he reduces Alexander to a swaggering paper-cut out, dehumanizing him with pretentious dialogue that wouldn't have been out of place on a Victorian stage. He blinds both audiences with hopeless, amateurish editing and a musical score that would embarrass the cheesiest toga epic of the 1960's. Poor Colin Farrell, a fine actor, is left holding the reins of this runaway horse. I watched the ""Director's Cut"" version and it seemed to me that Oliver Stone, like the ancient world he tries to depict, was simply overwhelmed by Alexander the Great."
"canuckteach","6","1","1","23 August 2005"," Nice cinematography - problem screenplay
","I appreciate the passion in the review of 'gest1969'. I've felt the same way about certain 'problem' movies. Yes, Stone's cinematography was spectacular.. and there's a lot of historical ground to cover. But the script just wasn't right. It's an old problem with movies of all sorts, but, surprisingly, all too common with big budget productions.<br/><br/>There have been documentaries with or without re-creations recently (i.e. the History Channel production 'The True Story of Alexander the Great', and a fantastic British re-telling: 'In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great', both of which I recommend.) So, what went wrong?<br/><br/>Stone's screenplay continually 'regresses' - the flashbacks are too numerous and lengthy. Maybe it was more of an 'editing' problem (the Director's cut DVD had no 'deleted' scenes) than a script issue? When you watch the 'deleted' portions in a typical DVD, you see some not-so-bad scenes that were, nevertheless, chopped, for the sake of pace or continuity. What did Stone cut from this one? <br/><br/>Jolie and Kilmer are big names, but their roles in this flick were of a 'supportive' nature. yet, we continually re-visit them for repetitious information of limited value. Farrell (Alexander) looked confused. It became tedious. I had my hand of the FF button throughout the 2nd half. Anytime after his entry into Babylon, I was ready to pack it in. (well, I stuck around for the battle sequence against elephants.. decided that life as a Greek soldier wouldn't have suited me).<br/><br/>For those who still disagree, try watching the other 'Alexander' productions (there's a ton of 'Alex' movies made in Asia, if you can get your hands on them, and at least one older Hollywood - 1960's?).<br/><br/>Finally, there is 'gory' stuff (well, what do you expect in a battle for the world?) and some needless sexual content... not for kiddies."

","Besides Colin Farrel's acting which is laughable at times, this movie fails in its editing. There are too many film techniques used in this movie. It is set in chronological order with narration (Hopkins), but gets confusing with the use of flashbacks. To make matters worse, there is more than one narrator at times to tell the story (Jolie) via letters.<br/><br/>It took me 3 different sitting to get through this movie. It simply could not hold my attention.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are amazing and Angelina Jolie's performance was outstanding. Hats off to Val Kilmer as well."
"lynnlefey","5","1","1","17 August 2005"," So... very... frustrating
","I've picked through a lot of the comments. Before I say what bothered me about the film, let me say what DIDN'T bother me. <br/><br/>Homosexuality as a subject does not bother me in the least. English and Irish accents don't bother me. Historical inaccuracy doesn't bother me.<br/><br/>These have been a few of the things that other people who loved the movie thought might turn people off of this film.<br/><br/>The film was visually pretty good. Minus the 'shaky-cam' that seemingly everyone insists on doing these days (which has been overdone to death, and almost never gives a good result), the cinematography was pretty good. Some moments were really gorgeous. Sets were good. Attention to detail in costuming was good. The score did not stand out (meaning I didn't feel artificially manipulated like some other composers), which means it was doing its job well. So those things weren't the problem.<br/><br/>The standout moment of BAD cinematography was the near-death moment for Alexander, after falling from his horse. Here's a good example of how NOT to use color in a scene. If you want to see how to do it WELL, see 'Hero'.<br/><br/>The acting ranged, but I have never seen Anthony Hopkins do anything other than stellar acting, so it says something that in the opening scene, the movie was already losing me. That can ONLY be writing or directing, and in this case, almost certainly writing. <br/><br/>It's not a matter of lack of patience. I sat through 'The Remains of the Day', an exceptionally slow movie, that was exceptionally well done.<br/><br/>The actors do frequently give good performances. Even Colin Ferril and Angelina Jolie are pretty good, and I don't consider either of them stellar actors. But the problem really comes not from HOW they say their lines, but the dialog itself. It's bad, and I can't quite put my finger on why.<br/><br/>I think perhaps Stone tries to accomplish more in this film than his skill will allow. It overshoots drama into melodrama. It seems to have a bunch of half-baked concepts that are never clearly explored.<br/><br/>By the movie's end (what felt like forty nine days after we started watching the film), I was literally shaking my fists in anger and clenching my jaw, so utterly frustrated at a film that was almost great, and failed in a huge towering miserable heap.<br/><br/>For those of you who rated this movie 1, however, I would like to point out the classic, 'Legion of the Dead'; a movie so bad I wanted it erased from my brain, even if that required surgery. If you think 'Alexander' is a 1, you need to readjust your scale... unless of course you're taking the movie's budget into account."
"Adamjammer","4","1","1","11 August 2005"," Points for effort mister Stone
","I give Oliver Stone points for effort. Having just studied Alexander a few months before in school, I remember sitting through the movie and thinking ""Wow, for a Hollywood movie this is pretty accurate."" Unfortunately I also remember thinking along the lines of ""This is ungodly long and not really worth it all."" In fact I suspect that the reason it was so long and a little underwhelming was that it was too accurate. Some people criticize Hollywood for having to distort every story it gets its hands on, but here is a case where the story was as accurate as could be, and it didn't play out well at all. Guess it's just hard to have it both ways.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, my major complaints: I felt the pacing was incredibly off. It suffered from being narrated the whole way by Hopkins as Ptolemy, recounting the story to his scribe. While again, this allowed for the movie to take in a vast picture of all of Alexander's life in good detail, it sucked the life from the story. Using a narrator as a bridge between scenes can work. But at times it seemed Hopkins would never stop quoting and recounting dozens of names, battles, cities and who knows what else that are never shown and are quickly forgotten. Too accurate, too slow, just not a good idea on Stone's part.<br/><br/>The script likewise was subpar. For any other director, it would've passed, but from an Oliver Stone film I guess I would expect the dialogue to be just a bit more memorable. It wasn't laughable per se, but there were some eye-rolling moments for me.<br/><br/>The actors were hit or miss (mostly miss.) Hopkins, even though his long-winded speeches could've put some modern day politicians to shame (and sleep), was good (not that his part was that demanding.) Val Kilmer...just didn't work for me at all. He did not work in the least as the father figure, not sure why, maybe I'll have to see it again to decide (if I can bring myself to do that) but he did not. Angelina Jolie did the best with what she had. I think her character was just a teensy over the top, but she stuck to it to the bitter end. Colin Farell did not do it for me, much in the same way Val Kilmer failed me. Again, I think part of it was that the material he was given to work with was well below standard, but he certainly didn't help it any. A dark-haired hard-drinking irishmen as the fair-haired wunderboy of ancient Europe? Too much of a stretch. And the sex scene in the movie is I think one of the few times where I have been in a theatre and the audience has audibly laughed at a moment not intended for laughter at all, it was a complete miss and frankly a pathetic attempt at drama. I'm sorry, but it was.<br/><br/>The things I liked: Jared Leto was alright, Jolie tried valiantly, the setting and props and costumes were sumptuously brilliant, and the cinematography (particularly at the end) was very well done. In fact the camera work I'd say is the saving grace for this movie. It makes it interesting enough to watch at some points, but cannot save it overall.<br/><br/>Personally, I can understand if you hated this movie. I try and cut directors some slack or else I prolly woulda ripped it apart much more. I can also see if you were able to overlook its inadequacies and didn't find it to be too bad. But to say you actually really honestly liked or even loved it? Well...I guess you're certainly entitled to your opinion...<br/><br/>Points for effort mister Stone. Next time though, let sex just be sex, please."

I skipped paying $10 at the theater to see it, so all I have to go on is the ""new and improved"" version on the DVD... After watching it, and the commentary track version as well, the core problem seems to be that the story of Alexander just isn't well suited to the format of a a 2 and half hour movie... There's just too much story.<br/><br/>The only way you could make a good movie about Alexander IMO is to do something similar to Amadeus, and make the lead character an observer of Alexander, that way you can skip the boring parts and focus on one aspect... For instance, Amadeus focused on the ""genius"" aspect, with a subplot around the Father... <br/><br/>But with Stone's Alexander, we get too much...

About Alexander's style life ( heterosexual or no), I prefer not comment because I have knowledge of the history and I can truly say that he was a Man and Great King.

"Lor3","Null","1","1","27 November 2004"," I think I think I like it...
","My first feeling (starting from the Hephaestion's thighs-quote) - and one that stayed throughout the entire film, was one of shock. Shock over the fact that that the Alexander/Hephaestion story line was there, from the beginning, in full sight for everyone to see. And I was thrilled beyond belief - I fell head over heals on love with them. I also think that that was the one thing that stopped me from thrashing the movie before it even started, because at he back of my mind I still thought the dialogue was appalling, some of the acting rather embarrassing and, honestly, didn't Olympias sound a bit too much like a rather campy Russian spy? But I did like the way the love-story was portrayed so casually, as a friendship above all others, as a hinted erotic relationship and just generally a different way of thinking before there was such a thing as being gay/bi/whatever. Now, I'm not an expert here, but I still have studied these ancient cultures (somewhat) and I do believe that this kind of scenario may just have been not completely false to history, given that we can never completely down-to-the-last-detail know (talking generally here - not just Alexander). <br/><br/>And this is where I - some 4-5 hours later - begin to rethink my thoughts about the rest of the movie as well. I'm starting to see small traces of the structure of the Greek drama/tragedy, both in the dialogue (still not quite over that one, though!;) ) and the way they incorporated issues like Oedipus, Medea killing her children and Olympias practically loosing/twisting her mind as a result of Philip's actions/character. It hints at a culture that had great thinkers, writers and philosophers who spent time and effort trying to understand Man and his role in the universe; Alexander most probably did believe that this was a culture worthy of expansion. In any way, it provided a nice background and a *sort of* structure for the story. Or perhaps I'm just desperate, for Hephaestion's and Alexander's sake, to like it? ;)<br/><br/>Although we, for example, did not see the full extent of his increasing arrogance and hubris, there were still other details that I was delighted to recognise (like the proskynés issue, Dareios' or Kleitos' death). I also appreciated the ""feel"" for mythology here in Alexander - there was a sense of them actually living and breathing at the foot of Olympus (which I thought was unfortunately lacking in ""Troy"").<br/><br/>So, all in all, it was a bit camp (not necessarily of the good kind...), a bit disjointed (I could've done without some of the flashbacks and storytelling), and although I liked (as much as one can like images of killing) the battle scenes (better than most films!), I missed a proper explanation of his strategy (as well as an overall plan), and perhaps I, personally, would've concentrated on other parts of his life.<br/><br/>But I think it's worth another viewing, if only to make my mind up on whether I like it or not. :)"
"jaymim101","Null","1","1","24 November 2004"," Here's a thought...
","Before you write a comment you should see the film first...(reasons following) 1) In this day and age, it's is more important to go against the social norms. What I mean by this is filmmakers should feel a responsibility to represent what there movies stand for. Of course I don't know Mr. Stones views on homosexuality, but I sure he won't stray away from this fact of the hero's life. In fact, he will probably exploit it by showing this trait as sort of a catalyst for his downfall. Who knows what he will do with it. The point is that if you can't feel comfortable with homosexuality on screen how will you ever feel comfortable with it in real life. I'm not a gay man but at least I find this trait to be fresh look compared to the clichés we see everyday and pay eight bucks for.<br/><br/>2) Your comment about a shaky camera is obtuse and incorrect. You forgot that it was used in Gladiator. Russel Crowe won a Oscar for his performance. So it is safe to say that the technique is not an excuse for crappy acting. Furthermore, it is not very difficult to act barbaric with a sword in your hand. <br/><br/>The BOTTOM LINE: Think before you write."

","I am an Oliver Stone fan(atic), and this is, indeed, his worst film ever. What was he thinking? I agree with the majority of other comments. There are only TWO rather static battle scenes in almost three hours - vs. so many sequences, well-staged, directed and edited in ""Troy."" (And that Trojan Horse looked spectacular. Is there anything equally memorable in ""Troy""?)<br/><br/>In both cases, however, the scripts the dialogue, were abominable, and easily on a par with those dubbed old ""Hercules"" imports during the 1960s.<br/><br/>In the future, anyone scripting an historical period piece like this should be required to read - or watch and listen - to Dalton Trumbo's adaptation of ""Spartacus."" The storyline was direct, fast-paced, and provided for several dynamic actions sequences. Most important, however, was the intelligent dialogue, especially that given to the educated Roman Senate, and the earthy slaves in revolt.<br/><br/>And regarding the earlier post about The ""Tomatometer"" at rottentomatoes.com, there are now 11 reviews, 4 are divided equally with a ""red ripe"" or a ""green splat.""

","I fell really sorry for all the people that didn't like and understand this movie! I mean these amazing pictures oliver stone offers us are just incredible! As an Italian i can maybe understand such a movie much better then all the Americans just being used to see movies with a lot of explosives a lot of action and a lot of none-sense! I'm sure that all those guys who found that movie boring would appreciate a kind of film like ""HULK"" and ""DAREDEVIL"" more then this one! There are a lot of critics talking about the movie being historically uncorrect!! Hey guys,how do you value Gladiator and Troy then? I must admit that there some aspects about his life that aren't shown in the movie, but if you'd put it all inside you'll have a never ending story! To all the people expecting Alexander to be a kind of terminator just walking from one battlefield to the other without showing up any feelings,please don't go inside!You will be just wasting your time and money and most important part!You won't understand it!! Colin Farrell and all the other actors were brilliant and the idea of letting them speak in an Irish accent was the best one Oliver Stone could have taken! And anyway what have you expected them to talk like? In an American slang,like: what's up Alex, how ya doing mate!? As I said the movie is fantastic!! You gotta see it!"
"junkfishy","9","5","12","25 November 2004"," very good movie with minor flaws, but without the Hollywood clichés
","This film turned out a whole lot better than I expected, because I thought it would be a typical Hollywood movie like Troy. I like the fact that the director included some controversial elements as well as some dramatic and complicated personal struggles of ATG himself.<br/><br/>In other words, this is NOT a movie for people who just want to watch a lot of actions and killings. <br/><br/>I saw lots of use of symbolism, political satires (maybe just me), Shakesperean tragedy bits in this film. The film-making and cinematography are both outstanding and unorthodox. I am not going to spoil too much but I think people who have watched enough all-but-the-same movies will appreciate this one.<br/><br/>On a minor side note, enough of criticizing their English, what else do you want them to speak? Greek? Some inaccuracies are present in this film though. For example, paper was not invented until 100-something A.D. and was not spread to the West until even later. Also, they speak of miles for distance, which is just wrong...But again, the audience would have no sense of distance if they say some Greek measurement units anyway."
"kknumber20","10","5","12","24 November 2004"," Historically accurate and completely wonderful
","This movie is incredible! It got a lot of negative reviews, but I think for myself, and therefore saw it anyway. I had been following the production of the movie for a long time and was thrilled when I saw it on opening day (Nov 24). It was very very good. People complain and whine about the difference between Macedonia and Greece and the accents used, but these things are irrelevant to the story. I knew it would be good, but it blew me away with how great it was. Every actor, big and small, young and old, gave a captivating performance. I think, if I had enough time each day, I would watch it everyday and never be bored with it. <br/><br/>The complex relationships Alexander had with his family and lovers were well executed and SO realistic and brilliant. And Hephaistion's character was my favorite. Even after power and war drove Alexander slightly mad, Hephaistion kept calm and was there for him. Their relationship was so touching, me and my friend whom I'd seen it with were quietly melting in our seats for him, he was so excellent. You really love the characters, especially Hephaistion, because they are like people you know. Philip could be your dad, Hephaistion could be your best friend, these are people you know, only with different faces and costumes, but it is interestingly portrayed in the film how people are still the same as we were in 323 B.C. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone spent a long time studying Alexander the Great, so it's best to believe that everything shown in the film is accurate. As for length and content, I didn't find it long at all, the time flew, I didn't want it to end! It keeps you constantly pulled into the story and plot because of compelling performances done by Collin Farrell and Anthony Hopkins. And because it is an R movie, there are certain things parents might not want to let their kids see like graphic violence to people as well as animals, sexual content and nudity, and yes, Alexander is bisexual and has romantic relations with some men, but mostly Hephaistion. I was so excited about these relationships though, because it was a daring move not often taken by filmmakers. Luckily Oliver Stone has the guts and brains to not shy away from controversial topics. I hope that parents won't deprive teenage/preteens from seeing this if they want to. I don't think that anything in the movie was distastefully done. Very tasteful, I thought. Very very good job done by Oliver Stone and the actors!!!"
"impliedi","10","5","12","24 November 2004"," Great film!!! May be Oliver's 2nd best!!!
","Just came back from seeing Alexander and after reading so many mixed reviews about it, I was concerned that I might be disappointed. <br/><br/>I was so throughly impressed with it!! The cinematography was extraordinary!! I was really impressed with Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Jared Leto & Colin Farrell's performances.<br/><br/>As is typical anytime Oliver Stone releases a movie, many people harshly slam his movies, because they don't like him or his style of telling a story. Often, the things they talk about don't even appear in the movie, so I think many reviewers judge based on what they've heard or they think it will be like, not what the movie is really about.<br/><br/>I laughed out loud at one of the user reviews that complained about Jolie's age compared to Farrell's(obviously that reviewer believes that there is no such thing as actor portraying a different age then they really are. I guess this person had better not ever go to see a play or movie ever again.<br/><br/>Same person complained about the accents. Uh, you're upset that they are speaking English. Are you kidding me??? How many thousands of historical pieces do the exact same thing. It's for the audience's benefit, not historical accuracy.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say be leary of some of the reviews you read. Some people just don't like Oliver, not matter what he does!!<br/><br/>See this movie & judge for yourself!!!!!"

","Now I know that there has been quite a few negative reviews for Alexander, but I think in the end the only opinion that matters is your own. Yet I still went into the movie with very high expectations. And the film met each and every one of them. <br/><br/>The movie was incredible. From the opening credits in Greek (which were very tastefully done, I might add) to the Battle of Gaugamela, I was hooked the whole way. <br/><br/>The acting is superb. I think Colin really surprised me as Alexander. His performance was outstanding at the very least. Angelina and Val shine in their supporting roles as well. Angelina turns in a marvelous performance that reminded me a lot of Angela Lansburry in The Manchurian Candidate. She is dark, mysterious, evil, and at the same time loving and protective of her son. Val was great as Phillip, and was in top dramatic form.<br/><br/>Vangelis's score was exceptional, and the same can be said of the cinematography, costume design, and special f/x. <br/><br/>I'm not very good at writing reviews, but I loved this movie, and there is a lot to be had here."

But if people don't understand something, the first thing they do is criticize. But it tells the real story of ATG and that is what is important.<br/><br/>Stone didn't make it a crowd pleaser, he told an accurate story, which I think is great.

","This movie was horrible, an abomination upon mankind. The movie moved very slowly, half the scenes were pointless. There were no relationships established between characters, all i got out of it was Colin Farrell wants to take over the world. There are only two battle scenes and they last about ten minutes and the camera doesn't stop shaking. For a movie about war and conquest they did a very poor job of displaying it. Also, there was some guy that looked like a chick that followed Colin Farrell around the whole movie, whats up with that guy and why does Colin keep kissing him? Some things i will never understand, like how does Colin keep getting work? Why Val why?!? The three hour sit was very painful it made me want to kill myself. Also, In the beginning there is a snake wrapped around the arm of Angelina then when we turn away to look at the kid when we look back...its gone. Where the hell did the snake go?? yeah thats right this movie stunk."

","I'm not sure what Oliver Stone was trying to say with this picture but in trying to do something different all Stone wound up getting was a mediocre film at best. <br/><br/>The plot is chopped up and hard to follow, Stone re-writes history at will, he skips over events that made Alexander and led to his being called 'The Great', the movie stalls on trying to mold the relationships of the characters and to the point where it doesn't even make a good chick flick. And the events that the show does touch on that were a very big part of Alexander . . . well that's all Stone does is just touch on them like some sort of 'honorable mention'.<br/><br/>If you like good movies, take my advice and save your money and go see a good flick. This one doesn't even rate as a 'B' flick."

","While it has its' fine share of flaws, this is a movie that was partially killed by critics prior to its' release. As a result, I went in with very low expectations after reading some of them when I rented it a few years later.<br/><br/>I will say, the first time around watching it, I was a little bit confused at times in that, like the critics said, it's not what you would expect from an ""epic"" movie about a military war hero, and with Oliver Stone directing it, expectations may have been a little high.<br/><br/>However, when you come down out of the ""hype"", and out of the critics' opinions, and just turn it on exclusively as an epic film, if you are in the mood for one, it will give you what you want.<br/><br/>On multiple views I find it refreshing as a result, and it gets better and better each time you watch it as you get out of the ""hype"" and ""critics"" mindsets.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful ""adventure"" story. We see Alexander lead his legions up against the Babylonians and venture across East Asia in the B.C. timetable. They run into typographical problems as they reach the Himalayas, but Alexander doesn't let his vision waiver and they press on into India, another foreign country that the Greeks knew not much of.<br/><br/>If anything, if you pay attention, you get an idea of Alexander's mindset. Going against the orders of his commanders, he marries a Barbarian, crossing breeds that up to that time were taboo for Greeks, especially those of Royalty. The assassination of Phillip of Macedonia, his father played by Val Kilmer, reveals an inconclusive history as who the culprit was, although it seems the power struggle for the throne was probably brought about by his mother, played by Jolie.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was fun to watch in this, even though it wasn't her best performances. Her crazy character was definitely a highlight and she is always eye candy in her prime here.<br/><br/>If nothing more, this is an ambitious (like Alexander), long, adventure movie, watching the struggles of Alexander the Great's conquest of the known world that mixes in some subtle political and philosophical ideas that makes you think a little bit more than you expected going into what appeared to be a classic epic movie. It's long, but that's one of the reasons I've come to like it- it's the perfect movie to put on right before you go to bed- it's good enough to entertain you, hold your attention, and make you think, but long enough to put you to sleep.<br/><br/>A very underrated epic film destroyed by hype and critics. In its' own way, it has ""greatness"", but you have to look past its' flaws in order to find it."

If the accents weren't bad enough (and they are bad, some of those Macedonian Greeks sure sound Irish) the script, costumes, sets, chronology, and especially acting in this movie are just embarrassing.<br/><br/>This is the story of Alexander the GREAT apparently, a whining impetuous Irish child who likes to scream at his Countess-Dracula mommy.<br/><br/>The homosexuality in this movie is not even worth discussing. Alexander by the histories was very likely in relationships with men, this was perfectly acceptable at the time in Greece, and it is of little relevance. Put it from your mind. There are plenty better reasons to be disgusted by this movie. Don't waste your time imposing Christian morality on this movie.<br/><br/>Everyone involved in producing this film should be ashamed that they took one of histories greatest conquerers and reduced him to a squalling crying child who spends more time playing with his boy toys than advancing his empire.<br/><br/>For shame."

Not every war from antiquity was fought for freedom. Most, if not all invasions were for land and or plunder. I am pretty sure that everyone born outside of the lower 48 states speaks with an Irish or Scottish accent, so to all actors out there, can we please drop facade.<br/><br/>To sum up: The same script that we have seen recycled nearly every year since 1995, delivered by actors playing themselves but with fake Scottish and Irish accents.

"moonspinner55","4","3","6","29 January 2005"," Joyless battle royale
","Oliver Stone stages this battle epic with his usual aplomb. His film isn't as cynical as one might expect; it has pomp and pageantry, and some kinky roundelay that shows most of the men to be accepting of homosexuality but the women to feel somewhat slighted. Does Stone portray Alexander the Great as sexually ambiguous? Yes, but it's not a heavy presentation and the sexual asides are actually a welcome relief after the bloody battle sequences. A whole lot of talent went into this picture and it shows: it looks expensive and expansive, and the horrors of war are shown in incredible detail. Colin Farrell turned out to be a good choice for the lead--his hair is a flagrant mess, but he's adept as a leader and his voice is surprisingly powerful. So what's the problem with ""Alexander""? I think post-production woes crept in and undermined Oliver Stone's confidence. The editing is messy, with far too much of Anthony Hopkins as our storyteller(Hopkins is aged quite well--he looks depressingly decrepit--but he has no role to play and just serves as a mouth-piece, our Guide through the soap opera entanglements of the plot); likewise, Val Kilmer as Alexander's estranged father and Angelina Jolie as his mother struggle with underwritten roles and look desperate not to appear foolish. Stone has never worked easily with women, and Jolie doesn't appear to be the kind of actress who'll turn dormant for a director, so the culprit here is the screenplay--which gives neither filmmaker nor actress a chance to be at their best. The film has sweep and it is focused(despite some flashbacks), earnest and intense. I just wish it had more heart and imagination. ** from ****"

","What the hell was Stone thinking. Here is a guy who made anti war films or should I say anti American films in the past. Now he's glorifying another war monger. What's the difference between Alex and Nixon. I suppose Alex didn't have to watch Patton for some reassuring before gearing up for war. This could have been a good film. All Stone had to do was concentrate on the action. I found his message about Alexander really being a force for good nauseating. The difference between Alexander and the likes of Bush and Nixon in Stone's mind is that Alexander is sexier and stylish. It's not what he does, it's the way he does it. But that counts a lot for Stone so Alex also has to be a good guy. The first battle scene was great. Stone should have packed the movie with action and more focus on Alexander's tactical brilliance which unbelievably is barely touched upon. Anthony Hopkins seems to be there simply because he's one of these sexy elder statesmen actors who get cameo roles in modern films just for the hell of it. All his character did was waffle on and on about God knows what because I wasn't listening too hard. Farrell is a good actor and it's just as well Hollywood knows it. If this had been his first major role he'd be straight back on the set of the second rate soap opera he started out on. In fairness to him, the script did him no favours whatsoever as it required him to babble on and on. Compare this to the tight as a straightjacket script for Russell Crowe in Gladiator that served him so well. A lost opportunity."

","I love the story of Alexander the Great and I've read several history books about him, plus the Manfredi Trilogy and I've seen numerous documentaries etc. I also have the original 1957 movie on DVD (with Dickie Burton) - which is actually a super movie, and is quite accurate - they used Prince Phillip of Greece (who was an Alexander scholar) to ensure historical accuracy.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to this new Alexander - it is quite simply total garbage. There is so much wrong with I don't even know where to begin...however I'll give it a try. Before getting into the historical aspects of the movie, I can't avoid mentioning the most bizarre thing about the movie - everyone in Macedonia speaks with a thick Irish accent...I kid you not...even Val Kilmer (who plays Phillip II) puts on the thickest Irish accent imaginable...indeed, you'll be intrigued to know that Miley (and I don't mean merely the actor Mick Lally, I mean Miley - a country-bumpkin type buffoon from an Irish rural soap called Glenroe!) appears in a scene as a horse dealer....<br/><br/>But back to the movie...now for those of you who may not know much about Alexander, there are a few of very important battles in his life...<br/><br/>Charonea (where he fought as a general under his father, commanding the Macedonian right). This battle established Macedonia as the leader of the Greek Federation Thebes (after Phillips death the other Greek states thought they'd revolt now that there was a kid on the throne of Macedon). This established Alexander as Lord of Greece Granicus - the first battle on Persian soil, and the first against Memnon of Rhodes, Darius Greek general The Siege of Harnicclus The Siege of Tyre (Alexander built a causeway almost 1km long out to the island city to take it) The Battle of Issus (the first time Alexander fought Darius) However, not one of these battles appears in the movie - instead, the first battle shown is Gaugemala (or Arabela) - which was actually the last major engagement fought against Persia...now this battle scene is done pretty OK but its inaccurate in a lot of the major facts...but that aside, this is the only action in the movie (apart from a small battle scene in India which isn't really explained, but I think it's the one at the Indus River against King Pontus).<br/><br/>But there are so many things wrong with the movie, I mean it is just so bad it's unreal...<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie plays his mother (Olympia) - and she's the same age as Colin Farrell Olympia has a Dracula-type accent? And she is also presented a kind of witch...which is not really that true, she had weird beliefs but she was very much a queen The battle tactics are all wrong - which is the whole reason the Phillip and then Alexander were so successful...Alexander did not fight on foot as seen in the movie. The whole concept behind Macedonian tactics at the time was the hammer and the anvil. The anvil - the phalanx with Sarissas ""locked"" the enemy into a pushing match, while the cavalry, organized in tight-wedges, 50 in each, with each horse locked closely against the opposing riders legs, punched a whole (the hammer) into opposing formations. The Macedonian cavalry at the time was the best in the world - it was effective because of it's ""dragon's teeth"" or wedge formations - they did not charge as individuals or in lose formation.<br/><br/>His sexuality is misrepresented...while it is likely he slept with Hephaestion, he was also very much heterosexual in his appetites...from slave-girls, to Barsine (Memnon's widow), to priestesses to Persian Princesses. Indeed, he wasn't gay or straight - but merely ""normal"" for a Greek at that time.<br/><br/>His personality is misrepresented - he was not a good guy - nor a bad guy for that matter...but both, and also neither...but he was certainly not the good guy we see in the movie - while capable of wonderful acts he was also capable of the most barbaric and horrific acts too. He once dragged a Persian governor behind his chariot for a couple of hours, as his ancestor Achilles did with Hector - but at least Hector was dead at the time...the Persian was very much alive for his chariot jaunt. He also killed 10,000 Tyreans, and sold the remaining 30,000 into slavery...<br/><br/>A lot of major characters are also misrepresented - Parmenion especially - he was far from a bungling winger who failed to hold the left at Gaugemala - Parmenion did not fail Alexander once and was by far the best of his general's...Phillip once remarked when discussing the fact that the Athenians elected several generals each year that they were obviously awash with generals but that he (Phillip) had only ever encountered one (Parmenion) But all of that aside, even if you knew zero about Alexander the Great, the movie is still garbage - it's boring, confusing, slow moving and contrived....they also managed to make the plot seem stretched and lacking in significant events, which seems almost impossible when you are talking about a guy who died aged 32, having subdued Greece, conquered Persia, founded 16 cities, married 3 times, conquered almost 100 cities, butchered tens of thousands, freed tens of thousands, fought in 10 major battles, traveled 10,000 miles, crossed mountains, rivers, seas...a man who was a philosopher, a theologian, a general, a king, an emperor, an explorer, a dreamer, a butcher, a destroyer, a builder, a psychopath, a lover, a hater,a patriot and a traitor all rolled into one...yet the makers of this movie make him look about as interesting as belly lint..."

","I don't want to give away any ""spoilers,"" because, hey, maybe you don't actually KNOW the story of Alexander the Great, and if I were to say, ""...and then his tricycle broke,"" then I may have eliminated the SOUPCON of suspense ('suspense' here meaning 'not absolute certain knowledge of precisely what is going to happen to you in the next five minutes') that MIGHT help you survive an otherwise necrotically boring film. ('Necrotically' is a word I may have just made up, as ""necrotising"" sounds more accurate. But I digress.) <br/><br/>Mind you, knowing the story of A the G won't necessarily BE a spoiler in and of itself, because this particular film has ""Americanized"" the plot. Throughout the film, it's pretty transparent that the director is trying to DRAW PARALLELS between AG's campaigns and modern-day US ones. A the G is not ""empire-building."" He is ""uniting peoples."" He's not conquering countries. He's ""liberating"" them. THEY ACTUALLY USE THESE TERMS. He talks about how great it is that people will finally be FREE. He waxes poetic about how people shouldn't think of other cultures, older than his, as ""barbaric,"" just DIFFERENT. But, you understand, it's still important for him to teach them in Greek schools, etc. And the Persian King, hiding in the hills of Afghanistan--er, I mean, Persia? They did everything but have him sing and dance and say, ""I want to be Osama-sama-sama!"" <br/><br/>So, of course, being George Bush in linen knickers, we can't really want A t G to LOSE just for the sake of historical ACCURACY. So, if you watch this film, you will think that A to the G was actually DEFEATING the Indians, and then thought, you know, these elephants? Not so much. Maybe I'll just go home instead.<br/><br/>Another interesting point that you may or may not have heard of: Colin Farrell cannot actually speak with a Greek accent. So, instead of having him try to speak with a Greek accent, they decided to have ALL OF THE MACEDONIANS speak with an IRISH accent, to match him. You keep waiting for Cassander to say that they're after the Persian king because he's ""always after me Lucky Charms."" <br/><br/>Furthermore, you will be happy to know that Persians and Homosexuals are pretty much the same thing, as evidenced by the fact that they both have a penchant for black eyeliner. Even Alexander--when he was poking the boys, he was wearing black eyeliner. When he was cavorting with girls, suddenly the black eyeliner disappeared. Now every time an attractive gay boy is around, I feel myself peering at my boyfriend to see if the rim around is eyes is getting darker.<br/><br/>One can't be too safe.<br/><br/>The film is basically one in which a narrator tells the story, and every so often they illustrate what he is saying with an ""action scene."" However, the choices of ""action scenes"" in this particular case make no sense whatsoever. After each seemingly random scene where nothing truly monumental happens, they tell you that the next day, week, fortnight, year, or decade, something HUGE happened that they're not showing you. It doesn't make any sense at all. To illustrate this point without giving away any spoilers, I will include here a short script, transporting Alexander to modern times.<br/><br/>Narrator: Alex was an amazing banker. I mean, of course, we glorify people we remember, which I'm going to mention now to minimize the number of people who write me later and complain about the historical inaccuracies in the rest of this movie. But I REMEMBER him as a fantastic banker. He used to drink coffee in the mornings before going to work....<br/><br/>*cut to scene of Alex in his kitchen with his friend, Hephaistion* <br/><br/>Alex *grinding coffee*: I really like these new beans. Sometimes, you know, you're in the mood for straight roasted Arabica, but the cinnamon in this blend is so...<br/><br/>Hephaistion: perky? <br/><br/>Alex: You're the only one who really understands me, Feisty.<br/><br/>*insert a twenty-five minute scene, of a close-up of the inside of the coffee grinder. Each bean in the coffee grinder is represented by a human being, and there is a lot of spurting goo as the blades of the coffee grinder strike each bean. They scream and are tossed into the air. It appears that the person in charge of graphics for this scene has played a little too much Rome: Total War, because of the way they have the above-the-grounds scenes, where you see the little groups of coffee beans, moving as little military units, and then you zoom down further in and come in at an angle to see the individual beans trying to attack the other beans to get a better position in the grinder. Somebody has told the director that one needs to have these kinds of scenes if one wants one's film to be called an EPIC. I smell Oscar!*<br/><br/>Narrator (yes, I said TWENTY-FIVE minutes later): but that wasn't the most important cup of coffee Alex was going to have that day. After he left for work, he stopped off at Starbuck's, where the barrista got his order wrong, so he pulled out a gun, shot her in the head, and then rushed to his office to kill his boss, twelve coworkers, and a goat. The other bankers applauded his vision and made him the director of the entire Western Region. He started out managing just the Seattle branches, but eventually worked his way up until he was managing the entire state of Washington, Oregon, Northern California, and Idaho. Six years later, he found himself in a board meeting in Coeur d'Alene....<br/><br/>*scene opens on Alex at the head of a conference table, grasping a half-caf skinny vanilla vente latte.* <br/><br/>...you get the picture.<br/><br/>Scratch that.<br/><br/>DON'T get the picture.

","Alexander has one of the best epic battle scenes ever brought to the silver screen. Towards the end of the first hour of this 3-hour account of Alexander the Great, we see him pitching his fifty thousand Macedonia warriors against a Persian army of a couple hundred thousand strong. The build-up is effective, from the strategy planning session in the tent to the jitters around the night camp. The pre-engagement pep talk resonates when Alexander addresses three of the soldiers in the rank and file directly, with personal intimacy. The presentation of the entire battle is splendid, from the close-up blood-and-sweat skirmish to the sweeping view seen from the eyes of an eagle, a scene strikingly similar to one in The Longest Day of the landing seen from two German planes. I would even put Alexander's battle scene slightly ahead of three comparable ones: more realistic than Return of the King, more stupendous than Troy, more varied than Spartacus.<br/><br/>But what about the rest of the movie? As an account of the life of Alexander, it does not quite impress. Colin Farrell has put up a good effort and given us a credible portrayal of the human side of Alexander. It's not fair to fault him as being too young; Alexander WAS young. However, while giving a convincing picture of Alexander as a top-notch general (such as in the battle scene mentioned above), Farrell comes short in having a strong enough presence to project the image of a great king. He tries hard to convey Alexander's vision of a united Europe and Asia but does not show enough passion, or madness, as some may say.<br/><br/>After the first hour, the movie sort of sags, becoming melodramatic rather than epic. There are two most talked-about relationships in this movie. The Oedipus Complex thing is a bit overblown by reviewers. The emphasis in this movie is much more on a possessive mother than on anything else. The homosexual relationship with Hephaistion, on the other hand, cannot be made any clearer.<br/><br/>The acting is generally good. Particularly enjoyed is Anthony Hopkins' soliloquy disguised as dictation to a scribe. This is a great master of the theatre at work. Also enjoyable is Christopher Plummer's brief appearance as Aristotle, much better than the dull role he plays in National Treasure. Should not forget to mention Angelina Jolie's successful tackling of a row very different from any she's played before."

","Alexander **<br/><br/>It's only January, and here is surely a contender for biggest disappointment of the year. A great cast, a respected director, a $100million budget - how could it go so terribly wrong? Despite having all the requisite parts, there are some clear problems; <br/><br/><ul><li>For a start, attempting to cover Alexander's' entire life in even this three hour monstrosity is an impossibility. It ends up cutting out 3 years here, 8 years there, and consequently the film struggles to flow and the characterisation never develops to anything below surface level. Stone would have been better of taking a leaf out of Scorsese's book and concentrating on just a certain time period in our heroes life, as in 'The Aviator'. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Despite his best efforts, Colin 'effin' Farrell is hopelessly miscast. Kevin Spacey certainly has a point when he says that having your face plastered over the tabloids hinders your credibility on screen. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't help but snigger when this alcoholic, drug taking, womanising, hard-as-nails Irishman staggers around in his Doris Day wig and mini-toga, snogging young men! Where's Russell Crowe when you need him?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The vast variety of different accents, ranging from Farrell's broad Irish, Jolie's attempt at Russian (I think!), and Kilmer's Shakespearian thesp, just sounds bizarre. And the sight of a young child actor attempting Farrell's Irish drawl is ridiculous!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The constant narrative is not only a waste of Sir Anthony Hopkins' considerable talent, but plain patronising to any one with a brain cell. Perhaps a film that actually flows in some kind of order would have been a better idea? I personally don't go to the cinema for a history lesson.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Angelina Jolie is just awful; feigning hysteria and constantly stroking snakes does not class as characterisation!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The editing of the battle scenes is terrible, being at such a fast pace that it is impossible to keep up with what the hell is happening. And labelling the different areas of Alexander's army is just stupid.</li></ul><br/><br/>There are a few highlights; Farrell's rousing speech to his doubting troops in the final third is brilliant, and Stone's decision to dub the film red during the final battle in India (somehow) works brilliantly. But these moments of brilliance are very few and far between, and I was greatly relieved when the closing credits finally rolled. Having looked so good on paper, Stone has created a sprawling mess of a film, lacking in the character and direction that usually defines his work. It may be a while until a production company trusts him with such a large budget again. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I would not recommend this film; if you happen to have three hours spare, go and see 'The Aviator'.<br/><br/>Adam Cox gives 'Alexander' 2/5."

","In my opinion this recreation of Alejandro Magno (Alexander) is disrespectful with this legendary hero. It presents a weak, mother dependent and sometimes stupid Alejandro (historically known for his incredible intelligence and courage). Numerous homosexual references during the movie shine as the main signs of his character, as if his sexual choices were the most important facts of this great man's life. One of the greatest contradictions of the movie is the character played by Anthony Hopkins who constantly tries to stress how great was Alexander in every of his comments, but then the reality shown in the movie dramatically contradicts this view. Why was he called Alexander THE GREAT? Hopkins repeat it constantly but the movie completely fails trying to show it.<br/><br/>I think Oliver Stone should go back to making movies about Vietnam."

I thought, I must be naive, that the men were not becoming absolute Joan Collins caricatures when they talk about the love they feel for their boyfriends. this movie is all about the vision of Hollywood on the ""old Europe"".

It made me think about all those movies where an American hero come to France or Italy... It's like if Europe had stop in the 50's. but because of information it's less possible so Hollywood take the past and make it American. See Benjamin gates ! We do not have a middle age ? let's import it ! and now with Alexander we have this kind of American propaganda movie (all the ""conquer to free"" don't remind you anything ? and the hawk !) with horrible stuffs everywhere on the screen. I think that Oliver Stone is an interesting artist but here, it seems that the subject was a little too big for him. I would have preferred the vision of a Paul Verhoven or what Kubrick could have done with this bigger than life story with so much stuffs.

"psi_fla","3","3","6","9 January 2005"," An epic failure
","Co-written and directed by: Oliver Stone<br/><br/>Starring: Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Rosario Dawson, Anthony Hopkins<br/><br/>Look, it's January, and it's time for the big studios to churn out their Oscar-baiting epics! What a great comeback it would be for Oliver Stone if Alexander, his take on the famous Macedonian conqueror, succeeded. Well, guess what. It doesn't. Worse than that, it's the worst film I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Deja vu. Those were among the first words that entered my head when I began to formulate my opinion of this film. Of course, it might just be historically inaccurate, but what do audiences care? Don't we simply go to epics to enjoy an impressive diversion, rather than to learn about history? The problem with Alexander is that it fails as even that. It may have fine costumes, great make-up, sumptuous sets, heroic speeches and some gigantic battles, but those have all been prepared better in the likes of The Lord Of The Rings, Braveheart, Gladiator and even The Last Samurai. Considering the potential that this story has, we really shouldn't settle for what comes our way here.<br/><br/>OK, let me bring you up to speed. Alexander attempts to chart certain aspects of the life and times of Alexander the Great (played as an adult by Colin Farrell) during its three-hour length. The film primarily focuses on his relationships with his parents (Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer) closest friend (Jared Leto) and first wife, Roxane (Rosario Dawson).<br/><br/>It also attempts to focus on his conquests and tries to show us what persuaded him to have such a constant drive for success, but it is ultimately unsuccessful in doing so. The most obvious reason for this is that large parts of the film are just boring - there is no life or meaning in the massive lines of expository dialogue that are thrown at us.<br/><br/>Stone is apparently renowned for his gigantic ego, and, sure enough, the film is overlong and narcissistic. In fairness to Stone, the film will alert people to an interesting historical moment, and he never really spares us from the horrors of war in his bloody battles. Yet how is the latter an advantage if the battles are tedious and incoherent? The Lord Of The Rings' battles might have been labelled as sanitised by some naysayers, but at least they were gripping.<br/><br/>I should also mention that Alexander (the character, that is) harbours potentially homoerotic tendencies. If you really want to see this film, then you may find yourself wondering afterwards why he really married Roxane and two other wives. That question is never fully answered, and putting such an issue aside reduces poor Rosario Dawson to the status of plot device. She isn't the only one - talented actors like Brian Blessed and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers are mere window dressing, and Anthony Hopkins is asked to do little more than tell the story in voice-over. (What a cliché.) Thus Stone has left the film in the hands of Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie, with Val Kilmer doing his best. What a terrible mistake. Farrell may have a knack for convincing in supporting roles (see Minority Report and Intermission) but if Alexander's anything to go by, he cannot carry a big Hollywood movie. Maybe it's the script, but not for one second did I believe his Alexander was a great leader. Still, at least he doesn't embarrass himself as much as Angelina Jolie. (What accent was she using again? Come to think of it, what accent were the actors supposed to use in general?) At least the likes of Blade: Trinity don't demand three hours of your time. I don't know about you, but Alexander has very nearly done enough to keep me from seeing another Oliver Stone film for life.<br/><br/>Rating: * (out of *****)"
"Fenris Fil","3","3","6","6 January 2005"," Forget morality, this film is about terrible casting and nightmarish pace
","Bill Hicks once pointed out that people got too wrapped up in the moral discussions about Basic Instinct to simply realise it was a very bad film. I'm seeing a very similar thing happen with this film.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of people giving this film a 10/10 and pour a load of praise on the film in IMDb reviews. Interestingly most of the comments have been defencive rather then actually positive, and they have been far too concerned with the ethics and morals of the film rather then it's function as a piece of historically based entertainment. Any film on the IMDb has a higher number of people giving it a ten then 7-9 and sometimes any other number, even those with weighted average ratings closer to 3 or 4 and it very sad that people do that. I've noticed that when there is a bad film made by a trendy (and usually much better) director it seems to get a load of 10 ratings before most people would even have had a chance to see it and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Anyway I think it needs to be explained to those that praise the film and go on about people not liking it and how they don't understand the morals of the film and that the bisexuality is okay, etc, etc, just why the majority thought this film was rubbish. It's nothing to do with Alexanders orientation or how that was portrayed or the morals of the film.<br/><br/>There are only two things you need need to know about the film: <br/><br/>1) The casting was terrible. Some of the minor characters were cast reasonably but the choices for Alexander and his mother was disastrous. Not because of either of those character acting skills but because of the following reasons.<br/><br/>1a. Colin Farrell was incapable of dropping his Irish accent or putting on a more sensible accent for his role. As such the supporting Macedonians were all forced to wear Irish accents as well. It's also been noted that he didn't make a very successful blonde. Sure the guy can act, but when casting you have to consider *suitibility*! <br/><br/>1b. On that note, why on earth cast a woman only 2 years older then Farell to play his mother? Totally bizarre. I love Jolie as an actress, and like most men think she is gorgeous, but she was just not suitable for that role. Also because she was one of the few cast members that chose to put on an accent other then Irish she stands out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>1c. The rest of the cast too have been blatantly chosen for their stature as actors rather then their actual suitability or capability to pull of the particular roles they were chosen for. The cast list is impressive, but that seems to be it's entire reason for being. It's almost like Stone is showing off the names he can attract (and the studio can afford) for his film. That is not, in my mind, they way to cast a movie.<br/><br/>2) The film has terrible pace and is nightmarishly long.<br/><br/>Alexander is someone that has fought more battles then I've had pizza's (and I've had a lot of pizza's). Yet if you were randomly skipping through the movie you'd really struggle to stop it at a point where an actual battle is going on. Visually these rare battles are impressive, but because of the poor build ups and the way the excessive scenes of long theatrical style monologues kill off any excitement you may otherwise be feeling about the battles it is very hard to appreciate these scenes.<br/><br/>Of course as I'm sure you've all noticed it's very trendy to overshoot films these days. It seems rare to see a film under 2 hours long and so many directors seem to be making films long apparently just for the sake of it. They want to be as epic as lord of the rings or Gladiator and figure that all it takes is to make the film really really long. Well the first thing you'd noticed about those two films (or 4 films technically) is that they don't seem anywhere near as long as there running time (even the 4 hour special edition of return of the king kept me interested for the duration, and I wouldn't normally compare films to LOTR but with so many people suggesting this is worth a 10 I think it has to be done). This film however seemed about twice as long as it's excessive running time and that is a very bad thing. People gave up and walked out with at least 40 minutes still to go! Now all those monologues may not be intended to come across as such, but all the actors seem to have adopted a theatrical style of reading their long long lines as if they were reciting Shakespeare. If this was a play I could live with that, but this is a film and it needs the right kind of pacing.<br/><br/>So in summary - terrible casting, terrible pace, excessively long. Bi-Sexuality and ancient morals are irrelevant in evaluation of this film, terrible casting, terrible pace, excessively long. QED.<br/><br/>Oh yeah there are also a good few cheesy clichés and terrible lines (like the one about ""of all the Alexander's he is the greatest"" what moron wrote that!). But really, overshadowed by the pace/casting."

","I had heard both good and bad reviews of this film. I took a chance and saw it. It is a BAD movie. The acting by most of the cast was certainly very average (at best). The actor playing Alexander was absolutely NOT believable. If the portrayal of Alexander was accurate at all, I doubt anyone would have followed him into any battle. His voice issuing commands was adequate but the rest of his demeanor was laughable. I was very surprised to observe that many of these actors playing Macedonians/Greeks must have learned their English in Ireland and Scotland? Such were the accents. The movie is far too long.

","I noticed 95% of the reviews on IMDb are in favor of this film. As opposed to the dismal ratings it received by the general audience or critics. I do not usually base what i see on critics, they are often wrong. I can appreciate the desire for historical accurateness, however in this movie i think it was pushed a bit too far. Certain movies are made to ""teach"" you, so that you see the movie and also lean something in the process. This movie wasn't billed that way,i doubt the audience really cares or would remember historical fact or details in this movie. Therefore call me insensitive or bigoted or whatever, but the bisexuality was unnecessary. Omiting this detail would have made the movie more enjoyable and would not in any way diminish his role in history, or change the nature of his deeds. It was an unnecessary distraction.People staunchly defend this to preserve historical ""accuracy"". Alexander is known for what he did on the battlefield not his choice of relationships, I'm sure he would want to be remembered for that anyway. Homosexuality has been an element throughout history, does every movie have to deal with it, no, did this one, i do not think it did. Seems more like a jab at politics than a sincere desire to preserve historical accurateness."

","I found this movie a disappointment. Mr Stones obsession with Alexanders ""Gayness"" was abhorrent. I also found that his treatment of Alexanders ""Straight"" relationships to be violent and not in-line with historical documentation. The following of Alexanders life was difficult. The movie bounces back and to from time frame to time frame. Most of the film I did not know what culture Alexander had encountered, or where they were. The battle scenes were very difficult to interpret or follow. Also I seriously doubt that Alexander boo hoed as much as Mr Stone suggests. And what makes Hollywood think that the Greeks all had Scottish Accents?? On the Plus side the costumes were very well done and the sets were done well also. Besides that I was disappointed."
"weitergehen","1","3","6","24 December 2004"," no plot, no vision, no movie
","Seriously, it is not so that oliver stone hasn't made movies worth watching. I mean they never were excellent or anything close to avantgarde (JFK or the people vs. Larry Flint were not bad), but this one is definitely out of any range. At first, there is no plot, no story to be told, no aim, no problem to solve; all there is, is the life of Alexander. Hey, we're in the movies not on some documentary channel. Worst of all, half the hard path (more so for the viewer than for Alexander) already behind, we are all of sudden forced back some eight years to watch alexanders father die. No clue to why at this point, no connection to rest of the plot. So after a twenty minute brake (""o gosh we forget the scene of his fathers assassination! lets put about here; might fit?"") we return to no plot. But who cares; no plot is no plot, anyway. Second: Please spare us those cheaply made red-blood scenes. Horrible, simply annoying. Who has seen ""the emperor and his assassin"" knows what one can achieve with colors. But it appears oliver stone didn't see this movie. All he does after Alexander is hit by an arrow is to take out all colors out of the picture except for green. I mean, please, we are not stupid. And it looks garbage. Thirdly: Historic facts don't match. 1. all of sudden all people conquered are fully capable of speaking Greek (douglas adams has already been there). 2. no Greek could count farther then 999; the Greek number system simply doesn't allow it. 3. no Greek was capable of reading quietly at that time. everything was read out aloud. Finally: ""Those who pursue their dreams are going to be the ones to remember."" What kind of cheap rubbish philosophy is that? Do we really have be punished this hard? And thats the main message of the film. As if this really counts. This is what destroys our society: overemphasized individualism. We don't look for our next and their problems. Only to be famous, to be remembered. What for? The one interesting point about this movie is realizing that old ptolemy indeed is anthony hopkins, even though I had a hard time recognizing him. All in all I honestly was bored, unchallenged and shocked by so little creativity as to how to make a movie work. a.t."
"morganmcalister","1","3","6","18 December 2004"," Unbelievably, colossally bad
","If not the worst movie I've ever seen, this was undoubtedly the most disappointing movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Alexander's actual history reads like a big budget Hollywood movie script - he even had an honest to god nemesis! Hardly anyone in real life ever has a single, life-long nemesis; to a filmmaker, it should have been like having a great movie delivered to him gift-wrapped with a silken bow, yet Stone manages to lose even this in the colossal mess he makes of this movie. Antigonus is presented as a virtually anonymous enemy commander, a far cry from the decades-long obsession that he actually represented to Alexander. When Alexander's men can't understand why he's willing to take such risks to kill the man, honestly neither can the audience.<br/><br/>This is but one example of how Oliver Stone managed to take a historical story that a mediocre film student should have been able to make into an enthralling movie, and turned it into a three hour travesty. Not one character is compelling - sadly, the most interesting character (aside from the four minutes or so of screen time that Sir Anthony Hopkins must have been tricked into providing) is Alexander's father, played by Val Kilmer. I say that it's sad, because WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO VAL KILMER?! Didn't he used to be able to act? Was he instructed to repress that talent for this particular role?<br/><br/>Another interesting dynamic that should have translated well to the big screen is Alexander's lifelong romantic relationship with Hephaistion, but Oliver apparently lacks the stones (ok, bad pun, sorry) to actually show any romance between them. Alexander takes an Eastern wife, and when Hephaistion walks in on the two of them working up to a sexual encounter, he gives what I assumed was a meaningful, jealous look, that would lead to an actual dramatic moment between the two of them. It didn't. All we got was another scene of them crying and giving each other a big IL' hug. And crying. And crying. I don't think there was a single scene where Leto wasn't at least tearing up, if not actually crying with his big, pretty eyes.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, when I first read some reviews that complained about how often Alexander broke into tears, I actually thought it might be a positive sign; that the reviewers were just expecting a big action movie, and couldn't deal with actual emotional content. To all of those reviewers: I apologize - you were right. Alexander reminded me of an ex-girlfriend of mine: the first couple times I saw him cry, I felt bad for him, and wanted to understand his feelings; but the 70th or 80th time I saw the tears welling up, I rolled my eyes and thought ""oh god, here we go again....""<br/><br/>I could probably go on forever about how tremendously Stone screwed up the story of Alexander the Great, but I'll conclude with my biggest gripe, which is that apparently Stone thinks that his audience is slightly less intelligent than the typical sea-sponge. The metaphors and themes are presented with the subtlety of a train wreck. Let's say a character's situation suggests a parallel with the story of Oedipus. Just before you could draw that conclusion yourself, Stone will flash back to a big painting of Oedipus. Before you have a chance to notice that the hawk that had been flying around Alexander's battles is gone, Farrell says ""hey, where did that hawk that was flying around my battles go?"" If the movie wasn't so awful, I wouldn't be so infuriated that it also deigned to insult my intelligence.<br/><br/>Oh, and before I forget, I have now officially lost almost all of the respect I once had for Vangelis.<br/><br/>In conclusion, wait for this movie to come out on video. Then don't rent it."
"George_Jetson_802701","Null","3","6","16 December 2004"," Whew! Really Tedious!
","Let me start by saying that I usually like historical/swordplay/swashbuckling movies. However, ""Alexander"" is mainly just tedious. There is a lot of extended dialogue that seem to have no purpose. Usually this is for the purpose of character development, but not in this film. I thought the battle scenes would be exciting enough to make up for this, but somehow they were mostly just horses galloping. You got the impression that nothing was really happening in the battles (this contrasts starkly with Braveheart and Gladiator). It got a little interesting when Alexander fought the elephants, but this wasn't much.<br/><br/>I might have walked out on the movie altogether, but I thought there might be more scenes of Rosario Dawson nude. Her body is even better than I imagined, and her scene was the only one in the whole movie that was interesting. However, during the love scene between Alexander and her, all I could think was ""Would Alexander even know what to do with a woman?"" All his previous experiences seemed to be with men. I guess that's why it took over two years to get her pregnant :^)<br/><br/>I must credit Anthony Hopkins. He is a good actor, and the scenes of him narrating were not bad. But again, this was a minuscule part of the movie. I suppose Colin Ferrell is not a bad actor, but what were his character's motives? Sometimes they seemed to be saying that Alexander's travels were motivated by a desire to free all the people in the lands he found. Other times, Alexander is just depicted as a guy traveling as far as he could to get away from his mother. Speaking of his mother, Angelina Jolie does play a good psycho; although I agree that she sounded too much like Dracula.<br/><br/>I suppose it is unnecessary for me to state that I do not recommend this movie. I am surprised; Oliver Stone is an experienced writer and director. Well, everyone has their clunkers."
"rosscinema","5","3","6","11 December 2004"," Disjointed Stone epic
","I'm not convinced that audiences were really expecting to view a film based completely on historic fact but I do think that they were awaiting something that had more clarity and conviction. The film starts out in 323 B.C. and the death of Alexander (Colin Farrell) as told by old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) who is dictating his experiences with the former king. Alexander was raised by his snake charmer mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and his brutish father Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer) although Olympias insists on telling him that his real father is Zeus.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>After Philip is murdered Alexander becomes the new King of Macedonia and starts his crusades of conquering other countries which leads him to proclaiming Babylon as his new home. He talks of uniting the races and even marries a Persian princess named Roxane (Rosario Dawson) which not only conflicts with his mother's wishes but with his Army as well. Alexander has a male lover in Hephaistion (Jared Leto) who accompanies him everywhere from the battle with the Persians at Guagamela to almost being killed in India. It's the battle in India that convinces Alexander to bring his Army home but by this time they have become divided in terms of loyalty and when back in Babylon his enemies await for the opportunity to poison him.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has once again given us a hugely ambitious project that he obviously has a deep passion for and shows once again that he's fascinated by people in great power. But to be honest, this may be his biggest disappointment to date with his personal views overshadowing the performances of his cast. Farrell is one of the most exciting young actors to come on the scene in years but as far as being Alexander would anyone really follow him into battle? The actor that's arguably wasted the most is Dawson who is so incredibly sexy and strong that you had to wonder why there wasn't more scenes of her and Farrell together. Another area that this fails in is Alexander's sexual relationship with Hephaistion which only consists of Farrell and Leto eying each other with the occasional hug thrown in. The film does better in the battle sequences and the final conflict in India is shot with sharp red tones by Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto. Even though Hopkins is the narrator his mumblings and ramblings don't add any real perspective to Alexander and it also fails to give any reasoning for his thoughts or actions. One can't just dismiss a film like this considering the credentials that Stone carries but he never seemed to get a grasp on the internal motives of this character. This is a disjointed film but it's one that again proves (to me anyway) that Stone is one of our more interesting auteurs."
"cases","3","3","6","9 December 2004"," Europeans won't like this either
","After seeing this film I can safely say that if Mr. Stone expected it not to be such a big flop in Europe as it was in America, he will be sorely disappointed. The problem is that most European viewers are able do do what Stone seems unable to do, namely to tell a bad film from an ""art"" film. Unfortunately slow-motion and coloured scenes are not enough to make a film ""artsy"". In the whole film there are two battle scenes, and while one is very good (the battle of Gaugamela), with a beautiful hawk's eye view, the other one is very bad (the battle in India). Watch the tacky slow motion part to see what I mean. Some of the sets are impressive, like the library of Alexandria, where the narration takes place, or the city of Babylon, but most of the film is composed by excruciatingly slow interior scenes. Most of the three hours are spent in endless speeches about the one or two concepts the director wants to get through, like ""bringing freedom to Asia"" (does that sound familiar?), violating the most basic principle of film-making, the ""show, don't tell"" one. This film tells (well, basically one thing many times over), but doesn't show. In fact, more than what's in it, I find annoying what is missing from it. The story of Alexander the Great lends itself to a lot of spectacular scenes and to more complex meanings than this director could ever think of. Where is the episode where Alexander and his army wade for miles in full armour in the Black Sea in order to take the enemy by surprise? Why aren't we shown the battle of Hyxos (spelling?), the fastest battle of ancient history, when the Macedons defeated the persian army in a quarter of an hour from across a river, with the superior power of their bows? (By the way we don't see these bows at Gaugamela: did they lose them on the way?) Why don't we see Alexander's crowning as a pharaoh and son of Ammon in Egypt? This film, where for once the casting is actually very fitting, could have been so much more. The rest has been said by the previous commentator ""tfrizzell"" better than I could have ever said it."
"cinephile06","Null","3","6","29 November 2004"," Alexander the Truly Awful (SPOILER ALERT)
","Shrouded in the mists of history, Alexander and his contemporaries are no longer around to defend themselves. That job is left to the discerning viewer, who, after suffering through this film would, I'd wager, rather lose the nine bucks to a hole in the pocket than to this derivative spectacle of how not to make an epic historical drama. Much ink has been spilled about the depictions of homosexuality in this film but far more controversial in my opinion in the kitsch value which skyrockets like a malfunctioning Snoopy balloon at the Thanksgiving Day parade. There are so many, many points to pick over, Alexander is a cineast's dream simply for the wealth of material over which to make snide comments. <br/><br/>First of all, the kindest thing would be to say that Colin Farrell was miscast, although the actor portraying him as a youth, at least, looked exactly like him (with or without the incredibly tacky dye job I couldn't say, but more on that later), giving the story at least a nod to continuity. Even before Farrell takes over the role there were problems, however. Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie seemed to be ensnared in a fierce battle over who could outcamp the other and I think there was a draw. This despite Kilmer's performance being particularly over-the-top. Perhaps it was the lack of depth perception fostered by the prosthetic eye scar, but it was as if he couldn't decide whether Philip was an unrepentant womanizing drunk, an unforgiving task-master, an awkwardly caring father or an obnoxious tyrant. As for Jolie (such a young mother, seeing as how she's only got a year on Farrell but never mind), her accent may have been bizarrely and creatively Slavic, but in a film where Farrell's Irish lilt kept slipping in in the strangest of places, and one of his troops towards the end gets up to deliver a speech in a Scottish brogue straight out of Braveheart (so strong in fact that it caused my companion to whisper, tongue planted firmly in cheek, ""I didn't know he conquered Scotland!""), what's one more incongruous voice among the din?<br/><br/>Once Farrell takes on the role the film just goes even further downhill. Historical accounts do say Alexander was indeed blonde, but to choose an actor who is so dark of coloring and then try to remedy that fact with what must have been EIGHT quarts of Sun-In (either that or a bad wig) was yet another curious choice in a movie full of them. I swear his eyebrows kept changing color throughout the 3 hours which proved distracting, and the hair color just took on a life of its own. While Nicole Kidman could get by with a prosthetic nose in The Hours based on the sheer strength of her performance, such was not the case here. Farrell never really embodied the character of Alexander at all, he seemed, for the most part, instead, to be phoning in the role of a young warrior with serious Oedipal issues, occasional flares of temper and accompanying bulging eyeballs.<br/><br/>The narrative, rather than being linear in scope, was more a mash of whatever the crew felt like filming that day. Oh yeah, and plenty of blood and gore and lots of crying and hugging. In a curious sense of timing, Oliver Stone chooses to pretty much gloss over Philip's death in the voice-over (only to go back to it later) as if we were watching the worst-scripted episode of the Wonder Years ever.<br/><br/>""The Plunder Years"" perhaps? Alexander gets into a fight with his dad over effectively being disinherited at the event of his dad's second marriage and impending new offspring and then, by the next scene we hear something along the lines of (""...so then Philip was murdered and Alex left for college. The keggers in Asia Minor were something else, let me tell ya!"") From this point on, we join in on Alexander's travels. There are battle scenes aplenty, but we also see the human side of the fierce leader as he heads down the line, dazzling the troops with his ability to remember complicated Hellenic names, their mother's birthdays, and that time they went fishing with Uncle Leonidas, right before he sends them into battle to die. <br/><br/>This is all unintentionally comical but the the greatest wince-inducing scenes are unfortunately those between Alexander and his lover since boyhood, Hephaistion. One of these scenes (all of which just had this uncomfortable sense of incompleteness), did, surprisingly yield the sole line of good dialogue in the film. Alexander, with Hephaistion reading over his shoulder, says after perusing yet another of his mother's missives, ""She charges an awfully high ransom for nine months of lodging in the womb."" That line just stood out because there was nothing before or after it that suggested that it even belonged in this film, seeing as how it was both witty and clever. It did summarize their relationship well, however. I am not sure whether scenes were shot that were subsequently cut out due to the current incendiary nature in this country, but there were absolutely NO love scenes between these two even though Alexander proclaims his love for Hephaistion to his mother at the start of the film. There are TONS of moony, meaningful looks, sultry glances, and proclamations of mutual desire but never is there anything more intimate shared between the two than a hug. I half-expected them to pat each other on the rear, spit on the ground manfully and split a six-pack. This was not the fault of Farrell or Jared Leto who both seemed to be trying very hard to get across what they could despite the limitations of the script. Such short shrift cheapens the relationship, is untruthful, and a sincere portrayal of what these two lovers really meant to each other would have added so much more to the story. What was either a fear or inability to show a romantic homosexual relationship was all the more glaring considering the gratuitous and downright silly heterosexual sex scene with Alexander's wife Roxane and the few concessions that ARE made to Alexander's sexuality. In one scene Alexander is shown kissing what I believe is a eunuch after much prodding from his men, and in another he gets into bed and sadly beckons what I believe is the same eunuch to join him, all in what appears to be an air of despair. These touches are apparently acceptable, but showing Alexander and Hephaistion in an atmosphere of mutual respect, accord and romantic love is far too scandalous. Oh how far we've come. The most passionate scene between the two occurs once Hephaistion has already died and his lover brings the roof down amidst keening wails, on all who failed to prevent the tragedy. <br/><br/>Alexander himself dies soon after but the film preceded him by at least two and a half hours. Every director is entitled to at least one stumbling block. Let this be the one left in the ruins."

Of course the average Chinese viewer would totally miss the point, thanks to the distributer and their translators. And I'm sure that was their intention. - Further on, when Alexander and his old buddies were applauding some male-dancers (in India) and Alexander went up to give a congratulatory hug, there was a loud chorus of ""Kiss him! Kiss him!"" from the Macedonian peanut-gallery, but the otherwise fairly meticulous translators simply ignored these simple words: no subtitles at all appeared. Here in ""free"" Taiwan, controlling people's access to information is practiced with the same flair thought more typical of our big neighbor to the west.<br/><br/>Some writers have complained about being constantly bombarded by homoerotic overtones while watching the film ....apart from a couple of chaste little hugs shared by A. and H., I can't think what they are referring to.... well, some people have a much sharper eye for such things. The bedroom scene with A. and Roxanna, however, was much more lengthy and blatantly sexual than any ""homoerotic"" episode in the film.<br/><br/>Some viewers may have forgotten the clear distinction made between sex and love, seeing ""eros"" where there was only ""philia"", but near the beginning of the film there was a clear allusion to the idea expressed by Plato (himself a boy-lover) that a chaste, elevated love was the ideal to be strived for. To the modern mind, romantic love SHOULD be sexual...but the ancient Greeks, at least the intellectuals, had a different point of view...and it shouldn't be that taxing to be confronted with it...even in the midst of a Hollywood spectacle."

Now unfortunately the majority of American's who don't know or remember their history classes are going to actually believe this as true. I wont give a history lesson, but if u really wanna know, google it. Other than that, horrible HORRIBLE movie. Why do the Greeks speak with Irish accents? Can anyone actually understand what Alexander is screaming 1/2 the time, when the music doesn't overpower him? I'm very much for gay rights, but I believe that this movie is counter productive. Most people in the theater just laughed at it because the script sounded like it came out of a teen romance novel. My friend actually cried because of the horrible way homosexual love was terribly portrayed. The plot line was confusing, leaving many gaps, and the audience wondering when Alexander would finally die. If you do see this, a way to make it enjoyable is to make fun of it the entire time. My favorite part was when Colin Farrell was talking to the troops and made this bulldog face. If only I had a pause button... Another part that I just had to laugh at for 10 minutes was when a friend of Alexander dies, yes people die it's a war movie. Alexander is so wrapped up in himself and his dreams that he doesn't even notice while we see the poor guy in the background having a seizure. Horrible but funny. Reminded me of Monty Python.

Basically, one of my main gripes is the blatant rip offs that this movie accomplishes.

"sppotlight","Null","3","6","17 November 2004"," A pitiful, over-achieving flop
","This movie is bad. There, I've said it. <br/><br/>As much respect as I have for Oliver Stone, he just plain tried too hard on this one. Fitting the entire life saga of one of history's greatest conquerors in one movie (albeit a painfully long movie) simply will not work. It didn't work for King Arthur, it didn't work for Troy (entertaining as that movie was), and it didn't work for Alexander.<br/><br/>This movie was bad on so many levels that it's hard to know where to begin. Let's start with the timeline -- or rather, complete lack thereof. Alexander was nothing more than a series of barely connected skits put together in random order. There were so many ""40 years later"" and ""8 years earlier"" that I thought I was watching a compilation of Quantum Leap. On the rare occasion that scenes did go in chronological order, there was no transition between one overly dramatic skit to the next.<br/><br/>And that brings us to the second problem with this movie. Never before has a cast so clearly defined the limits of their acting abilities. The overly emotional (and utterly too obtrusive) musical score almost made me forget that Angelina Jolie's most significant role involved shooting historical relics, not being one. The drama between her and son Colin Farrell was straight off an episode of The OC, it was that thick and unbelievable. And as much as I respect Oliver Stone for taking on the unfortunate job of trying to portray Alexander's complicated sexuality, the theatre literally erupted with laughter every time one of the actors tried to give another a significant look. I'm serious, this movie was so ridiculous I thought I was watching something staring Jimmy Fallon. And if Anthony Hopkins looks mournfully off into nowhere one more time, I'll cry.<br/><br/>The hilarity goes on and on. There were so many overly-dramatic speeches that even the director seemed to get bored, when at one point during a overly dramatic pre-battle speech he abruptly cut to a nonsensical shot of an eagle over the battle field. I'm serious, Colin Ferrel's words just ceased, and suddenly there was this eagle. And then they started again, at some other point in some other sentence. And how about that random hairy Greek with the Scottish accent? If you're going to fake an accent, at least fake a correct one. Or better yet, just don't speak at all. That'd make the movie much, much better. And will someone ever hire a cameraman that doesn't have Parkinson's? Not all battles happened during earthquakes. It gets nauseating.<br/><br/>Not that this movie was a complete loss. It was big-budget, and that shows with some really cool scenery and costumes. But the over-the-top acting was unforgivable. There was no way to take it seriously. Unless you truly don't care about anything but eye candy, don't waste your time."
"JwadeG","1","3","6","16 November 2004"," Don't waste your time and money on this.
","This was the most wretchedly boring, insulting, and heavy handed hunk of three hour filth that I am likely to see this year. This is the kind of film which ruins careers and bankrupts movie studios. In a theater of 250 people, all of whom got in free, I heard not one single positive comment... I would rather tear out my own eyes and use them as earplugs than watch this film again. And I get the feeling 249 people would agree with me. We're deep into ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"" territory with this one. Bad, bad, and bad some more.<br/><br/>To be more specific, for the first 45 minutes to an hour we get non-stop exposition. First Ptolemy (who is, for some reason, in his late 60s despite the fact that the caption card says ""40 years later"") wanders around his terrace (giving us approximately two brief glimpses of an expensively digitally created Greek coastline) dictating his memoirs to a scribe. We listen to this for quite a while as he gushes about Alexander the god-among-men. Basically saying ""If you (the viewer) don't love this man, you are wretched...""<br/><br/>Then we get to see Alexander's birth, his mother's near rape by her husband, King Philip (who, for some reason, is characterized as a drunken brute to make Alexander's golden curly locks look all the more godly...), and Alex growing up. Far too much of Alex growing up actually. And, let us not forget the overblown and endless dialogue which he speaks to the horse. ""Your shadow is just a trick of the sun. Ride with me."" And on and on and on...<br/><br/>Oh, and we get to hit the homosexual thing early on too. But I won't bother going into detail with that, because it's so hamfisted and crowbarred into the story that I've actually blocked it out of my mind...<br/><br/>After the hour which we waste watching Alexander grown up, we cut back to Ptolemy who proceeds to narrate most of the scenes which the people in the theater have come to see. No battle at the Granicus River. No battle of Issus. No scene of Alexander being told he is a god at an Egyptian temple... None of it. (By this point I had already wanted to walk out at least once, but I stayed on the off chance that the film would ""redeem"" itself with some mindless action. [this from a man who loathes mindless action.] And now even the action is taken away from me.) <br/><br/>Apparently because we're more concerned with the man than the action. But by this point, the examination of Alexander the man had already gone horribly awry.<br/><br/>Finally we get to see the battle of Gaugamela. But we may as well not have seen it. Someone got a bit carried away with the idea that ""an army battle in the middle east would stir up a lot of dust"" and much of the sequence is too cloudy to make out. What you can see is a lot of blood and Alexander apparently riding his personal squad way out to the right. (Even though the caption card calls it his ""left"" wing.) Apparently he's trying to take advantage of a hole in Darius' battle line, but the whole scene makes no real sense. Mercifully, it is over by the 75 minute point in the film.<br/><br/>And, since we've now bored everyone to tears with an hour of talking, followed by some of the least entertaining mindless gore in cinema history... bring on the floppy breasts.<br/><br/>That's right kiddies... Now Alexander gets to have a near rape scene, and, as a ""reward"" for making it this far into the film without walking out, we get to see his Queen's nice rack jiggle around for a while... Hooray for the objectification of women...<br/><br/>After this, pretty much everyone gives up on the film... Including the filmmakers themselves. I have to mention the ""brilliant"" slow-motion-rain-of-flower-petals shot which was so corny that it made everyone laugh. And the nonsensical plot point of being met at the gates of Babylon by a million cheering citizens and yet saying ""as long as Darius has not been found he will always be the ruler here..."" And then some more objectification of women. And some shots of sexy gay boys as well. (Let's not forget our gay theme.) But then some more women, because we don't want to offend anyone. (Never have I seen a film which dealt with homosexuality with so little courage... It claims that Alexander and Hephaistion were lovers for their entire lives and yet they never kiss in the film... There is only one male on male kiss in the entire film and it's done from a distance... And yet breasts are shown in all their glory...)<br/><br/>And we can't forget the door slam/orgasm thing which made everyone laugh (unintentionally). And then there's the ""monkeys"" thing. And some more ""hail Alexander, for he is the messiah of freedom and all who oppose him are simply racists..."" And some more horrendously botched battle footage. And lots of slow motion. And endless amounts of overwrought and stupid dialogue. (Hephaistion's death scene being particularly excruciating. I actually shouted ""CUT"" in the theater.)<br/><br/>And, finally, after all is said and done (two full hours after we should've all walked out) we get to go back to Ptolemy who reiterates how wondrous Alexander was, and how he was a force for good, and how if we don't love him, we're all wicked and evil. Basically recapping with a ""there you have it; if you didn't like that film then there's something wrong with you.""<br/><br/>And then the credits shamefully appeared.<br/><br/>And I shouted ""Boo."" Very loudly.<br/><br/>Shame on everyone involved in this film."

","I don't think it was as messy as many claim; that unchained chaos some critics say runs rampant is very appropriate, especially with the subject at hand and when you're on campaign! I don't like some of the assessments, ex, with the battles, because every person who (doesn't have a time machine) hasn't served their country (almost the entire country), their opinions are baseless. You can't compare the pandemonium of war to the glamorous vision Hollywood feeds you either (a film isn't less for lacking in it); Alex and his boys aren't going to show off to their enemies with some bullet time moves when dodging arrows and Alex isn't going to jump off Bucephalus and pull a Legolas with that Indian elephant. The hectic made it real.<br/><br/>Aside from some annoying chomping-giggling girls behind me in the theaters, that's all that could fall under irking or things that needed improvement... although, those girls did urge A and H to kiss when it seemed like they were and disappointed when they didn't, as well as clapped at the end.

Damn, did I love their screen time (chemistry) and praised the film for its display. I was shaking the whole film (so excited and nervous) and gasped and cried (horrible, I know, but there were others crying, so I didn't feel alone) when Hephaistion died while Alexander was telling him their future together. I wanted to scream at Alexander to shut up and turn around, lol. His scream and view afterwards was great.<br/><br/>The performances, the dialogue, the raw emotions, I did not find to be over dramatic. Most situations (all situations?) characters were fighting for their lives and futures, so I wouldn't take that lightly unless you didn't see yours or others as much. The scenery (beautiful), the battles (the battle in India, awesome), and all the rest, were gorgeous and grand. The quotes and symbolism were all lovely, and I did feel like such a massive (ever proud) nerd for the prior knowledge and knowing who quoted what.

"FargoUT","8","5","13","28 November 2004"," Alexander the Human
","Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" has been on the receiving end of a great deal of controversy and slanderous criticisms. And to a very slight extent, the opinions condemning the film have merit. But in picking apart the film, piece by petty piece, these critics have unfairly tarnished what is otherwise an above-average epic, not quite reaching the heights of ""Ben-Hur"" but far superior to ""Gladiator"". All in all, Stone has created a beautiful-looking film with good performances, brutal war scenes, and some over-the-top Shakespearean melodrama.<br/><br/>Of course, it isn't hard to see why people are upset. ""Alexander"" does not focus on the man's conquests, but instead on his emotions, his drive, his reasons. It asks, ""Why?"" when moviegoers seem to want to know, ""How?"" Even the mainstream critics have trashed Stone's creation, which surprised even me. If anyone is to appreciate his work, it should be the pro-critics. One obvious clue should come from the title and its noticeably absent ""the Great"". Stone is not focusing on the legend, but on who the real man might have been. Taking that course, it is no surprise people are disappointed.<br/><br/>There are flaws, of course, as with every film. Primarily, the voice-over work by Anthony Hopkins is harshly detrimental, in filmic terms. Voice-over is considered some of the worst technique in storytelling, and ""Alexander"" is chock full of it (presumably because Stone has so much to say in so little time). Elements we want to see are instead told by Ptolemy (Hopkins) as we watch Alexander's army wander from battle to battle. There's a commonly-held philosophy in screen writing: don't tell--show! Some of Ptolemy's monologues are decent and allow us further insight into the story, but some simply gloss over important elements of Alexander's life. <br/><br/>And it is far too drawn out. With only two major battle scenes, ""Alexander"" strives towards great drama instead of great action. And while Stone's battle scenes are brutally intense, they are often cut short or interrupted before any sort of climax. One jarring example comes during the first intense battle between hoards of Persians and the Macedonians. Midway through, so it seems, the film cuts to Alexander parading in through the Persian empire, victorious. With so many scenes of Alexander's armies wandering around through deserts, you think he could have excised a couple to shorten the length.<br/><br/>But those flaws aside, ""Alexander"" is an absolutely stunning film to watch. It is pure eye candy in a way most films only wish they could be. Where movies nowadays revel in CGI to ""create"" a look, Oliver Stone uses old-fashioned camera tricks (filters, panoramas, etc.) to establish a visual palette that puts the recent (and similar) epic ""Troy"" to shame. This is a rare big-budget Hollywood sword-and-sandals film where the sets look like ancient buildings. Where the crowds of fighting extras are, for the most part, real people. Where the blood and brutality of battle is shown in graphic detail. In a crucial scene, Stone implements a pink (almost infrared) filter which provides for some of the most gorgeous images I've ever seen in a major motion picture.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell has his work cut out for him with the role of Alexander and succeeds quite admirably. He portrays Alexander as a conflicted man who becomes legend with his death. Angelina Jolie chews the scenery, complete with a strange Russian/Transylvanian accent. This is exactly the type of film Jolie's face was made for--and she excels here. Most impressively is Val Kilmer, giving a bravura performance as King Philip. This is Oscar-quality work from Kilmer, and if justice holds out, he should get a nod for supporting actor. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone has made an epic of grand sweeping vision about a man who arguably doesn't deserve it. He's pared off ""the Great"" legend and myth, strive to look at Alexander the man, whose impressive conquests overshadowed his flaws. In doing so, he'll find himself lambasted by almost everyone. People dislike thinking of their legends as problematic humans. And Stone's flair of over-the-top soap opera makes the film a likely target for cynical crabbies (and before I create the wrong picture, I am myself a cynical crabby). I find myself wondering why I appreciated the film as much as I did--my jaded side seems to have been beaten into submission.<br/><br/>In closing, ""Alexander"" is not a great film, but it is a very good one. It is a step up from ""Troy"" (which I also enjoyed), but it isn't the grand Best Picture of 2004 that I was anticipating. Once the dust settles and it is relegated to the video stores, people may come to recognize the good qualities of this truly epic film. When all is said and done, this is a solid 8 out of 10 on the IMDb rating scale. It could (and should) have been better, but it certainly isn't the disaster critics are talking about."

","Alexander is taking a lot of crap from people who say it was boring, too long, too talky, and things like that. I guess Alexander could not be expected to be 100% historically accurate but for a movie that aims to encapsulate some highlights of Alexander's life it is not that bad. Yes, there is a lot of talking and yes the film spends a lot of time dealing with Alexander's personal conflicts but why can't people deal with the more emotional, personal side instead of needing to see endless battle scenes with little dialogue?<br/><br/>Another thing that bothers me is that there are some people who are making a stink about the portrayal of love between men in the film. I mean, seriously, there were certainly a few scenes where the men show and tell that they love each other but there was no sex or major kissing going on. On the other hand, there was an extended fight scene between a naked Roxanne and almost naked Alexander that nobody is talking about. Early on in the movie, there is dialogue about where Alexander's mother recognized his penchant for boys and tells him about the things he must do in public for show and how they are different that what he does in private. Anyway, it just bothers me that a film cannot even show muted affection between two men without drawing comments from homophobes. I really think this aspect my be a driving force behind why people don't like the movie. I've heard people say that there was ""just something about"" the movie they didn't like and I think that is what it is.<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked the movie. Yeah, it was talky and a bit drawn out, but overall it was not horrible. Maybe it will inspire some people to do some of their own research on Alexander the Great.<br/><br/>Lastly, it's nice to see that Stone didn't compromise for the big box office receipts. I am pleased that he told the truth of ATG life. I would rather have accuracy than a lot of fluff."

I think people are confused and wanted to see a three hour long war movie... but this is not the case.. This shows the life of Alexander from birth to death, with only two major battle scenes. The CGI, sets, is amazing. Babylon is beautiful.. Alexander's trek across Asia is visually stunning. The only complains i may have are the accents, and it does seem a little slow at times. Overall, this movie is exactly what I wanted to see... if i wanted to see Troy again, i would have waited for it to come out on DVD. Yet it's funny how the modern man's ignorance is displayed in ""homosexuality"" just grow up. It's part of life.. just as anything else is.<br/><br/>This film is def. worth seeing... 8/10."
"niall-neligan","10","4","10","6 January 2005"," Go see it, the critics are wrong.
","Having heard plenty of negative reviews about Oliver Stone's Alexander biopic, I was pleasantly surprised at just how good this movie truly is. Having grown up watching such classic war movies as Zulu, and Lawrence of Arabia, I was certainly impressed with the scale of Stone's movie. The battle scenes are truly epic and break with convention; there is a rawness to the battle of Guegemala depicting the inherent confusion that can occur when two armies clash on a dusty battlefield What many of the negative critics seem to focus on are the various interplays between the leading characters, whether it is the stunning Angelina Jolie who plays Alexander's mother Olympias or his male lover Hephaistion played by Jared Leto. What the critics seem to have missed is that Alexander was not a god but a flawed human, albeit a brilliant one at that. The relationship between Alexander and his generals is intriguing to say the least, that he may indeed have been poisoned by them in the end is not as far fetched as some critics seem to think.<br/><br/>Many of the negative critics (writers from some of the most right-wing newspapers in America such as the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post) find unpalatable is the thinly veiled dig at the Bush administration. This is dealt with in the parallel drawn by Alexander entering Babylon and Bush going to modern day Iraq. The right-wing press has never forgiven Stone for JFK and Nixon and they persist in calling him a 'conspiracy theorist'. Of course what seems to irritate them most is the fact that Colin Farrell speaks with an Irish accent, and not with an American drawl. The use of Irish actors and accents for the Macedonians is an interesting departure, although a little hard to stomach even for an Irish audience. What Stone is trying to do is to differentiate between the Macedonians and the Greeks; the Greeks are given English accents, this approach is quite realistic.It should not be forgotten that there was a fair amount of prejudice on the part of the Greeks to the Macedonians whom they considered bumpkins. What is very clever about this is the fact that the later day British Empire owed much of its military prowess to Irish Generals (such as Wellington) and soldiers.<br/><br/>Alexander has not done well in the US market, that is not to say that it won't do well elsewhere. Alexander I believe will sit more comfortably with European audiences more attuned to the subtle interplay of the characters. Alexander is a far superior film to Troy which was truly shocking. Let us hope that the studio bosses in Hollywood don't lose heart with Alexander's under performance at the box office and decide to pull future sword and sandals epics. As for the viewer, forget the negative comments and go see it."

The portrayal of ancient Greece, its customs, politics, beliefs, and pageantry are vivid and accurate. The performances are truthful, rousing and heartbreaking at the same time. Probably one of the year's best, and one of the very best in its genre.

"dreighruhtra","10","4","10","25 November 2004"," Brilliant
","Considering the enormous life that Stone and his people had to tackle and portray with this film, I can hail them in doing an absolutely brilliant job. Obviously, Stone had to cut out and leave out a large amount, which might lead to some confusion concerning the story for those that sadly enough are not educated enough to know and accept the life of one of the greatest men that has ever lived. But Oliver Stone did a sincere job to try to portray this man who has inspired so many throughout the centuries (now millenia). <br/><br/>Also, I'd like to add, despite the negative reviews, especially about the acting (even in the new york times), that have been made for this film, the only way to really understand the story is by studying it thoroughly. BUT, watching this film is a well worth short cut. I think that the performances were brilliant. Especially that of Colin Farrell, who portrayed Alexander, with all his youthful vigour and emotional complexity, marvelously. Although I got that he really worked his best to understand and love Alexander just by seeing him in the film, his interview (alongside Oliver Stone and Angelina Jolie) with Charlie Rose on PBS fully convinced me. Farrell became Alexander. <br/><br/>Stone and Farrell (and the rest of the crew) have given back to us the magic of greatness that can so easily be lost in this modern commercially driven society (which has dire effects on our level/intensity of education among other things). Alexander can inspire us to achieve greatness once again."
"futureidol","10","4","10","25 November 2004"," The film is as large, glutinous, beautiful, and sensorial as ancient Greece itself.
","Aristotle hailed tragedy as the highest form of art. It is only fitting that Oliver Stone's <i>Alexander</i> be presented in the dramatic fashion of the ancients. Homeric like verse flows through the characters marvelously and effortlessly. The dialogue is rich with symbolism and wit, and the actors' voices soar with a raging intensity. The players seem to move within a world too mythically august to be real, yet too gritty to be false.<br/><br/>The triumph of the film rests on the wonderful cast, ravishing scenery, and the tragic tale of victory, loss, and infamy. <i>Alexander</i> is a wonderful myriad of renegade film making, splendor, and humanity. The film stays with one long after one has left the theater, because of the its surreal visions and the multitude of philosophical questions it raises. Throughout the film one is bombarded by a fury of engrossing and bizarre imagery; haunting memories and breathtaking places. The majesty of the most flowering artistic period of all time is explored in detailed fantasy, giving us a glimpse into the past, when Homer was the Bible, and art was overwhelmingly prominent and celebrated. The glory of Babylon, Macedonia, and India shine in luminous color and depth. The pacing of the film is drunken and chaotic, emulating what is true in life; sometimes unfocused, confused, as it seeks to illuminate the conflicted Alexander. The audience is presented with Alexander's nightmare, through his eyes, an unusual, but fulfilling and new approach the the epic genre. Mary Renault's literary masterpieces of the fictitious and historical Alexander are obvious influences, as scenes from Alexander's childhood are reminiscent of those in Fire From Heaven. The focus is on Alexander's personal exploits, and influences, which are fascinating and highly stirring. Stone paints the portrait of Alexander the tragic and human hero, rather than Alexander the epic hero. Unlike the vapid portrayal of ancient heroes in film's like Troy (not a fault of Homer's), Alexander is a rounded, heartbreaking, and realistic hero. Alexander, played brilliantly by the talented Colin Farrell is a tortured soul, lusting for glory, desperate for love, and in dire need of fulfillment. Alexander's drunken brute of a father, played flawlessly by Val Kilmer, and his overbearing mother Olympias, played with equal gusto by Angelina Jolie tear their son in two with their expectations. Alexander's internal struggle between being the <i>man</i> his father wants, and the <i>boy</i> cherished by this mother is the central development of Alexander's character. He eventually becomes a man, but still remains a shining youth, wide eyed and full of ideals. We are confronted with Alexander the human being. He writhes in grief and burns with passion. His success as a leader stems from his ability as a general and king, fighting side by side with his men, rousing their spirits with his glorious speeches, and treating his comrades as equals, imperative to his mission. The combination of youthful enthusiasm and stubborn will made for a winning combination as Alexander the Great was never defeated. The film only includes two of Alexander's numerous battles and victories. The first battle at Gaugamela is an accomplishment in film making. Dust swirls and blinds, an eagle soars above the masses giving one a breathtaking birds eye view of the battle, the camera shakes, one loses his senses, and all becomes chaos. The reality of the battle is stunning and honest. Darius, Alexander's Persian adversary is shown as a powerful figure in battle, but the audience does not get to know the character, as Alexander himself did not know his own enemy. War becomes a gray area, the good vs. the bad is unclear as it often is in reality. The second battle takes place in India, and the adversaries are even more unclear and frightening. Elephants boom through the jungle and stand on their hind legs to challenge Alexander's horses. Beautiful shades of red and yellow soak the jungle floor and ceiling as Alexander nears death. Stone chose to make Alexander's bisexuality a focus in Alexander. Homoerotic imagery is prevalent, as sensuous men in short skirts and eyeliner flit across the screen in a fog of insatiable beauty. The endless imagery of smoldering male youths lends accordingly to the Greek sensibilities of the time. Hephaistion (Jared Leto) heats up the screen with his flirtatious, impossible blue eyes, that run like silver arrows through Alexander's heart (as well as the audience's). Some of the most loin igniting moments come from scenes involving the duo, who's chemistry is undeniable. Hephaistion is clearly illustrated as Alexander's soulmate and most cherished lover, as they consummate their love in touching declarations and heart melting exchanges. Hephaistion's boyish awe and calm stabilizes Alexander's stubborn idealism, and vice versa. Leto plays the role of Alexander's most trusted companion in a way that is so convincing, the need for a love scene is unnecessary (although I certainly wouldn't have minded). His lustful glares are overt, his voice soothing, and his love true and all encompassing. Their relationship certainly was up to snuff with the heroic lovers they worshiped, Achilles and Patroclus, and in the name of tragedy their end was just as heartbreaking...<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW: http://thepopdiaries.blogspot.com/"

","I saw Alexander tonight, at what was the first large public screening of the movie, and is it a stinker. It's virtually incoherent, Alex speaks with an Irish brogue, his mother (Angelina Jolie) speaks with a vague Russian accent, it's violent as all hell..but amazingly not exciting. The battle scenes are impossible to figure out, and the film goes on wayyyy too long. Several people walked out of the screening. The tone and amazingly stiff clichéd dialog go back to the Joe Levine sword and sandal epics of the 1950's and 60's, the ones that were dubbed from Italian. I can't believe Stone wrote and directed this dreck. I normally enjoy his movies; they're certainly never boring. But this one is a snooze-a-thon. I see huge losses and empty theaters once the word gets out on this bomb. Oliver, go back to what you know, provocative modern day stories."

","OK, this movie blew. Without ruining the movie, the directors tried to force feed the fact that Alexander was a homosexual the entire movie. This movie could have been a lot better if the directors had not focused on the fact that in Roman and Greek times it was acceptable to have male AND female lovers. Instead of showing maybe tops a scene about that they decided to hammer that fact into peoples minds. I understand that they explained the whole fact that he slept with other males and I would not have been bothered about it. But the director could have cut back on this fact and showed more of other aspects. I think that the acting quality was good, the effects and the actual fight scenes were excellent, but the agenda that the directors chose to shoot the movie from was what ruined the movie for me."
"Gleipner_Tapestry","6","3","7","29 January 2005"," Oliver the Unforgivable
","One hundred and fifty million dollars? Check. Notable cast? Check. Well-loved hero? Check. No wonder Warner Bros thought they were sitting on a sure thing with Oliver Stone's Alexander, what famous director could go wrong with that material? Had the crew at Warner Bros actually watched Natural Born Killers then there would have been less tragic premature celebrations and more MAYDAY MAYDAY ABORT FILM! WE HAVE A TURKEY ON THE 2004 SCANNERS! <br/><br/>This film is reportedly the film of Stone's career. He stated himself during pre-production that it had been his lifelong obsession to depict Alexander the Great cinematic ally. The obsession shines through as the film suffers from trying to capture too big a story into three hours. The plot is disjointed and poorly paced, the chunks of plot that we see are awkward and without clear motivation. These two are the only real flaws of the film, but they add up in so many areas that they effect all aspects of the film. Otherwise, the bulk of the film -which is centered around Alexander (Colin Farrell) conquering the barbarians- is enjoyable simply because of the extraordinary production value. It had realistic and convincing battles, costuming and sets.<br/><br/>However, I cannot see past the inclusion of the sequence of terrible narration scenes centered around an older Ptolemy (Hopkins). Older Ptolemy prances around in a courtyard full of earthly delights, recounting tales of his life fighting for Alexander and offering his views on what made Alexander the Great an icon of human triumph. These scenes are hammy and awkward; they are so artistically contrary to the constructed reality present in the bulk of the film that they are almost unbearable to watch. Stone couldn't think of a better way to express time passing and events happening than an old fart flouncing around a ridiculous set explaining what's going on from 30 years later. Logically, I can understand that it serves to link together the disjointed plot, but it takes deus-ex-machina to a horrible extreme; Ptolemy is so obviously a plot device rather than a constructed character that the scenes simply amplify Stone's poor vision and style. That Stone included these scenes is unforgivable; they embody a real nadir of film-making.<br/><br/>Whilst Stone has been financially punished in the poor box office performance of Alexander, a lot of the influential reviews attack the film for petty uneducated reasons. The lazy pop media critics took the negative reviews of more educated reviewers and amplified the scathing comments to create a distorted persona of Alexander in the world press. No doubt you've heard media associated with the film with key phrases such as 'bad blonde dye job' and 'Alexander the Gay'. These comments are misleading; the screenplay of Alexander is frankly disturbing, and calls for more contempt and attention than the trivial subject of Alexander's hair and sexuality."

Anthony Hopkins's' boring,soporific voice glosses over all of Alexander's cruelties, massacres ( he slaughtered men women and children in the plains of India and the hundukush as punishment for trying to resist him, hanging fakirs and seers , while demolishing tyre to the ground.) as for historical accuracy, anyone who claims it is so has got his history all mixed up. there is no mention or even depiction of the leftward feint at gaugmela, and the plans for the battle were revealed by Alexander to his general on the very morning of the battle, not th night before. as for the battle peter Greene considers Alexander's most skillful , the fight with porus at the hydaspes ( both because the Greeks were against elephants, and because porus and his Indians were a much tougher nut to crack than Darius), we are subjected to a skirmish in a dense thicket, with lots of confused slashing, Alexander wounded by a face pierced rajah who runs away from the battle. in fact, it was fought on the sand banks of the river, after a daring Greek night crossing which took porus by surprise, who was , incidentally captured alive. by the way, Alexander was wounded on his way home at the town of Malia. as a reprisal, the Greeks razed it to the ground and massacred every living soul , including children , goats and cattle. ( but of course, Anthony Hopkins's would shrug his shoulders as say , so what!).<br/><br/>in conclusion, for a man who was famous as a great general and a poor public relations man, we get to see more of his public relations side and less of his military stratagems. he comes out more as a weepy confused lad who strangely enough, wins against odds. and by the way, contrary to the announcement in the beginning , Alexander did not last long in the lands he conquered. the Asians got rid of his satraps as soon as they could and reverted back to their old selves."

The worst bit about the film, is not the mediocre acting, its the fact that everyone close to Alexander speaks in an Irish accent when he is around, then it fades away the further the person is from him, its a kind of Irish proximity effect. worse than that is the fact that most of them can't speak in an Irish accent at all.

When Oliver Stone make a film, 20 minutes can be cut out or the movie drags. 60'd type drug effects in parts of the movie, like Stone's other film 'The Doors', not needed. Too much of Alexander's wife in the film. I give Stone credit this is a hard task to create. (Epic films have to be though and history left to interpretation) Stone's 'Nixion' was a better film, but of course personal interpretation leaves room for error. I did not mind the film. There is a but in here, and the but is. Even with the big screen I would suggest wait for video. 6 out of 10. I might like it more if I watch the film a second time and pick more up.

Nothing annoyed me more than the fact that he had manipulated historical facts in order to make Alexander a worthy king. From the burning down of Persepolis in Persia to the raping and torturing of the people whose civilization he had just ruined Alexander had made a fine example of how not to be a worthy ruler but director Oliver Stone not only neglects these important facts he instead portrays him as a mirror image of ""Cyrus The Great"" ( The king of Persia who upon conquering Babylon wrote the first charter of human rights and allowed everyone to live in peace regardless of their background and religion). Let's face it, Alexander was a fine killer. He ruined a great civilization by spilling blood all over the place much like what today's G. Bush has set out to do."

They are used to being told a story on TV from start to finish and not too much in between.<br/><br/>We have to realize that most Americans get their visual and historical education through the television, a medium that is rottening brains.<br/><br/>So, intelligent movies that offer too much information at once is something their little pea-brains will reject.

It seems a lot of people are just little children who can't sit still in a movie for more than an hour and half, especially since its not ""action packed"" with loads battles. This is a grown up movie where you are not entertained by shiny special effects every second and instead have to follow the story. Colin Farrell did an amazing job especially taking into consideration the range of emotions he had to take on. It was interesting what aspects of Alexander's life Stone chose to delve into and I think it worked well. I agree with another reviewer that a lot of people were put off with the homosexual themes of the film, many in my screening laughed at these moments. Once again grow up and try to understand why these characters are the way they are. This is Stone's interpretation of Alexander's life so some historical facts are distorted and missing, but I think Stone's vision of it is very interesting.

","I don't like Oliver Stone at all and I have always considered him to be an absolutely talentless director. I've seen many of his films and liked none of them. I've read so many bad comments on ""Alexander"" that I went to cinema to laugh (I've read that this film is only to laugh at) and to admire beautiful horse Bucefal. In spite of such prejudice I didn't find ""Alexander"" so ridiculous as it was described, on the contrary, I think it is MUCH better then ""Troy"", ""Lord of the Rings"" or other ""battle films"" and it is much better than other Oliver Stone films. Maybe because vulgarity, silly habit to moralize, primitiveness and some other Oliver Stone's bad habits don't look so striking in this genre.<br/><br/>I think that this FILM IS VERY PACIFIST: Alexander was a very unfortunate and unhappy person who had cruel parents and lived in cruel time and because of his upbringing he became neurasthenic and mentally unstable: he wanted to be generous and couldn't control his anger at the same time, he wanted to have open soul and be equal to his battle friends and at the same time he considered himself a deity. As far as I understood the author of this film, Alexander couldn't find peace in himself and that's why he was so militant and lonely. Besides, his strange ideas and neurasthenic behavior caused SO MANY DEATHS! That's why, I think, Ptolemy said at the end of the film that such people like Alexander are better die young before they kill all life around. I agree with the pacifist ideas!<br/><br/>And I also would like to say several words about how the film is done--I mean several words in defence. ""Alexander"" has many failings (nonsenses of different kinds), but these failings are not new for Oliver Stone, so I don't understand why they can be forgiven in his other films and cannot be forgiven in this one. I've read many comments where Oliver Stone was accused in having done unintelligible battle scenes but I would like to remind these critics that Oliver Stone had been unfortuned to take part in REAL battles himself in Vietnam and so he probably knows better how does it look in reality. I would also like to say that there are some beautiful scenes in ""Alexander"" (that would maybe considered quite vulgar in an ""independent film"" but are absolutely in their place in a mainstream film, look here very beautiful and highly artistic). Actors play their parts very well (something new for an Oliver Stone film). The idea about accents was very strange, I think, but I didn't ""suffer"" it---I've seen the film dubbed into Russian.<br/><br/>I think it was VERY hard to make a film on this topic and of such scale and Oliver Stone did it PERFECTLY AS FOR A FILM OF THIS GENRE!<br/><br/>Oliver Stone was not good as an ""independent"" director but is VERY GOOD, EXCELLENT as a mainstream director.

He tried to be historically accurate, telling us that Alexander was a complicated Uebermensch living a short life with amazing accomplishments. We were shown that his wars were gruesome. The battle scenes were just awesome, cinematography and costumes were outstanding. The acting was a little to melodramatic but it did not bother me. <br/><br/>I loved how he portrayed the Asian and Indian tribes. All in all superb although a little long. Anthony Hopkins as narrator was an interesting idea, but did not really add much to the story except that we learned some more background info. It gave the movie a touch of documentary what was probably intended by Stone. Enjoy the masterpiece.."

","What do you expect the actors to speak? In the Greek tongue with real ancient Greek accents? There are many films of this nature that are filmed in English, no matter the accent. Be it American, British, Welsh, Irish we all speak English with different accents. I cannot understand all the complaints about the accents then rating the film low over it. Clash of the Titans, Antony and Cleopatra, Gladiator, etc... all speak in an English accent and language. To bash this film (Alexander) over accents makes no sense what so ever. So the accent and language complaints of this film are completely invalid.<br/><br/>The idea is to tell us an entertaining story in movie form and the film makers did that quite well with Alexander. I like this film. I realize it might not be 100% accurate but none of the films of this nature are because none of us were there to really know exactly what was said, who said it, what they did and and didn't really do.<br/><br/>Overall I found the film quite entertaining, it gave me an idea of what it might have been like during this time period and how it might have been with Alexander the Great.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","I remember when this came out, most people (and particularly in Greece) were annoyed, including myself, from this seemingly messed non-linear-story movie, with no sufficient respect to the iconic historical person and to the ideas he represents. Stone started being called Stoned.<br/><br/>One day after watching Jared Leto in the Suicide Squad, I was compelled to see Alexander once more where he plays Hephaistion, the historically supposed love of protagonist's life. And this was where all the problem of this movie began. Excellent cinematography, dialogues, writing, editing, music, had less impact than the love story of the main character. Diminishing it to a peephole-movie rather than the biography of 4 in 1 king (King of Macedon, Persia, Asia, Egyptian Pharaoh) everybody expected to see. Indeed this was a serious mistake, both historically probably inaccurate and vexing for the viewer. Alexander had according to historians 3 wives and more lovers (women) than his supposedly unfaithful father, plus a personal harem. He might indeed have had some unconfirmed bysexual traits, however this is not the reason he is remembered today by the whole world. His battle record, military genius and inspiring spirit were depicted as collateral damage to his ineffable character.<br/><br/>Today with sufficient distance from the first shock, I was able to appreciate the rest of the movie. I was amazed by the cinematography, the artistic touch in scenes of action, drama or romance and the great historical accuracy of production design, battles depiction and costumes. <br/><br/>Even if Alexander was not far from this depiction, we live in a world a lot different than that time. What was ethical then would not necessarily be today and vice-versa. But you cannot sell a lot of pasta in Italy if you label them ""noodles"". <br/><br/>All in all, for 155M$ you get a more real and far better movie than the 175M$ CGIed Suicide Squad. (And I am a hardcore DC fan). The kind of movie that makes you want to buy a projector for home. Just skip a few scenes the first time"

","I was so looking forward to seeing this movie because of the great soundtrack album by Vangelis. I wanted to see the Roxan'e Veil and other songs and what part of the movie they were in.<br/><br/>The movie was free to watch on the net. It starts off with a death and then Anthony Hopkins goes into the details of the life of Alexander. It is so boring and confusing you can't believe it. Hopkins is a good actor but he talked on and on there was no action for about 12 minutes. He went from places in the garden in a beautiful house/castle and walked next to a bird he scared when he pet it.<br/><br/>Alexander is blond, young looks and talks more like a college kid that a fighter.He talks and talks and lectures his men how they can conquer the Macedonian kingdom. These men are all in uniform with soldier fighting outfits, fighting staffs, metal helmets and more. <br/><br/>The man that played Alexander is like the class doofus. There is a man with long brown hair and a necklace with a round metal on it. He looks just like a woman until to see his chest. Hardly anyone believed they could do what Alexander said they would. Some scenes with Alexander and a male admirer reminded me of the way men look at women not men looking and talking to men.<br/><br/>There was not much music the first hour. There was a scene that was really dumb. It is with Angelina Jolie who is the mother of Alexander. She is teaching him how to be nice to a snake. She puts the snake around her sons neck and it so happy the way he is responding to the snake. Please kill me now! I don't usually talk this way about films I like or don't like. I could not stand this film. I did not see it to the end it is over 3 hrs long. If it was better I would have watched.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of Alexander is so great you think the movies was too. There is a lot of bloody killing in the movie long long long figths. The good thing I can say is the photography, the lining of soldiers in thousands ready for war in the desert and the sand be kicked up by horses with soldiers and soldiers marching to fight. The rest was bull."

Personally I believe it must be ranked as top crafted movies. The conversations are lengthy but they leave meaning to the movie and characters, so they aren't just fillers. I did several researches about Alexander after I finished the movie and found many parallels which matched the movie.

"gotlbh","7","2","4","20 May 2015"," Forgive the flaws and enjoy the grandeur of this mammoth film
","This film narrates the story of one of history's great military figures, Alexander of the Greek, Egyptian and Babylonian empires. In brief, Alexander was conquering Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East a few hundred years B.C. He died very young and by the time he passed away he had amassed a huge empire, a pretty incredible achievement made even more so by the fact it was done in such a short space of time.<br/><br/>The film is largely a telling of this history, albeit with some creative license here and there according to other commentators who have researched the facts a bit. The story is told to us as a retrospective in the third person, through the eyes of one of Alexander's Generals who outlives him. This format allows the story to jump around chronologically, so that we go back and forth to different periods of Alexander's life and slowly stitch together the bigger picture of the character, his motivations and his achievements.<br/><br/>This format requires the viewer to concentrate a bit harder to follow the story than would be needed if the story is told purely chronologically. But it also gives the film an extra dimension, allowing the viewer to discover more about the central character's motivations as the film evolves rather than laying them all out at the start.<br/><br/>This is a grand film, hugely ambitious in scope, and best viewed in the full 3.5 hour Director cut to fully appreciate the film's scale. The sets are magnificent, lush, visually sumptuous, as are the costumes and the CGI is thankfully quite limited. The battle scenes are chaotic. The dialogue is rich, especially in the scenes with the Generals debating their expedition - almost like a fly on the wall peering over a military soap opera. The cinematography is at times really stunning and the acting is on the whole not bad at all, with decent turns from Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins amongst others.<br/><br/>Overall, rather like Alexander himself, I think this film tries to reach too far. It is too ambitious and it's attempt at scale and grandeur doesn't quite succeed, giving the film a bit of a sprawling and incoherent feel. But the effort is truly admirable and for pure visual pleasure it is certainly worth a watch, and maybe even a re-appraisal."
"Leofwine_draca","6","2","4","17 March 2015"," Unfairly maligned, likable historical epic
","Although I'd never seen it before, I knew that Alexander was a troubled film. The sheer number of different edits and versions available on DVD is testament to that – none of them successfully capture the 'spark' that would make the film a crowd-pleaser in the same way that TROY enthralled the masses. Despite the problems – and there are a fair few of them, not least the long-winded nature of the narrative (Hopkins' character is laboured and dull) and the slow moving and extraneous scenes – this is still a film I enjoyed. It's a pretty good retelling of the ancient story, employing a large cast, most of whom get the chance to shine on more than one occasion, and the spectacle is suitably impressive.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is something of an obscure choice as the Macedonian hero, but I was surprised to find he actually fits the part very well. He brings a high level of humanity to the part, making us focus on his character's warmth and integrity. Angelina Jolie is cast as his mother, even though she's only a year or so older than him in real life; this matters not. She, too, is effective as a sinister witch-type character whose overriding love for her son also makes her sympathetic to the viewer. Val Kilmer has fun as Alexander's one-eyed tyrant of a father, Philip.<br/><br/>There's plenty of globe-trotting going on along here, along with debates, arguments, and cold-blooded murder. There are only one or two battle sequences, but they're big in scale and rather effective. By far the best is the fight in the jungles of India, in which Alexander and his men find themselves up against an army mounted on hulking elephants. Stone directs this part very well, soaking the screen in a blood-red canvas to ably evoke the chaotic events unfolding in front of us. It's gruesome, brutal, moving and disturbing, all as warfare should be, and in fact one of the best battle sequences I've witnessed in a film yet. It's a shame the whole of the film couldn't follow the same standard. Still, it tells an engaging story and, while it might vary in terms of effectiveness, believability and scope, as a whole I liked it, if not overly so."
"davisonhorst","1","2","4","3 November 2014"," Gaily we go off to war. Off to war we go.
","Yee God, apparently, according to Oliver Stone, everything in ancient Greece was gay with the exception of the horses and elephants. You wonder how any of them had children. Another revisionist history drama according to the Hollywood fruitcakes. Except for the battle scenes this was one of the biggest pieces of trash to come out of Weirdywood since Myra Breckinridge. Alexander the Sissy and his boyfriends were bad enough, but Colin Farrell was a disaster as Alexander. Farrell can't act period, in anything, much less as Alexander the Great probably the most powerful leader and general in history. Angelina Jolie is surely nice to look at. But, her misplaced and overly done infatuation for Alexander were ludicrous at best. Anthony Hopkins the Great was totally wasted and without a doubt would have liked to have been anywhere but on the set of this amateurish film. I continued to watch it as I thought it must come to its senses and get better than this. It didn't. Just got worse. Don't waste your time with this garbage."
"Goodfellasz","9","2","4","12 April 2014"," Alexander revisited vs theatrical cut
","The first time I saw Alexander, I saw the theatrical cut. To be honest I have always been intrigued by the unique life of Alexander the great (I still believe that it is impossible to not have some kind of respect towards someone who conquered such a great part of the then-known world in only ten years) And having seen this theatrical cut I thought the movie was mediocre, watchable but not as good as brave heart or the Vietnam drama Platoon. <br/><br/>Nevertheless I heard that the revisited version of this movie was much better and having seen this version now I must say don't waste your time with the theatrical cut, but go see the three and a half hour long version. Despite the fact that this version is without doubt of epic duration, the movie seems less long and boring than the original cut. I don't want to spoil anything but in this version Stone has also switched the order of some scenes which makes it easier to watch this movie without getting bored but which at some times can be confusing.<br/><br/>However adding and reshaping the storyline doesn't turn this movie into a perfect picture. The flaws that were present in the theatrical cut remain in the revisited version however they seem to be less annoying. Colling Farell performs very well and in the extended version a more emotional dimension is being added to his character explaining some of his reactions that seemed somewhat strange in the original version. Val Kilmer gives one of his greatest performances, although he has not that much screen time. Anthony Hopkins seems to be less great in his role. Sadly enough Angelina Jolie still gives the worst acting performance in the history of mankind. Her forced accent sounds so terrible that one would mute the sound so he would no longer be tormented.<br/><br/>Historical this movie is more or less accurate (Alexander was no blonde and some of the events mentioned may not be 100 percent accurate but overall this movie shows a rather true image of this man. There is much ado about the action scenes, there wouldn't be enough action in this movie and the action scenes would be too long. However this movie is no action movie and chooses to focus on the emotional side of Alexander.<br/><br/>So don't waste your time with the theatrical cut, but go watch the revisited version."

That's what happened to Once Upon a Time in America, that's what happened to Blade Runner, and that's definitely what happened with Alexander.<br/><br/>Seriously people, but the revisited version<br/><br/>I'm not saying this movie doesn't have a few flaws (sure, Colin Farrell wasn't the best choice for Alexander; it was weird seeing Angelina Jolie, only a year older than Farrell, portray his mother; and some of the monologues were campy and dragged on), but Alexander Revisited (The Final Cut), the movie that Oliver Stone intended to make and release, is truly ""the whole magnificent vision.""<br/><br/>If you watch the version that was released in theaters, or even the first ""director's cut"", then yes, I can see full well your stern disposition on the film. However, (history lesson here), as with Blade Runner & Once Upon a Time in America (two other films savagely mutilated by Warner Bros.), the film was dramatically cut and altered from it's original form to coincide with necessary run times that the studio demanded the film to be, or to better accustom an unimaginative and generic mainstream media. With Alexander: Revisited, the film is left to it's original intended form from director Oliver Stone, and feels like a significantly more complete and all-around extraordinary films. It is severely underrated and truly gives you the whole scope, the whole dream and vision of Alexander's life and what his empire was, and was dreamed to be. It's magnificent.<br/><br/>So seriously people, buy the Revisited version. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"bkoganbing","8","2","4","1 July 2012"," Adventurer/Conqueror and open gay man
","Being a fan of the classical school of acting I have a particular fondness for the 1956 Alexander The Great that starred Richard Burton. He was a guy born to play roles like that, just like Charlton Heston. Still Oliver Stone's Alexander has much to recommend it, especially with them finally dealing with the fact the man was gay in a society that sexual orientation didn't matter. In 1956 they could only be most subtle on that issue and Burton's Alexander contained not a trace.<br/><br/>The love of his life was a childhood friend named Hephastrion and the relationship between Colin Farrell and Jared Leto as Alexander and Hephastrion is quite clear. But one of the duties of a monarch is to provide for orderly succession in any culture. When Farrell marries Rosario Dawson the Babylonian princess it is to provide heirs for a world he's uniting.<br/><br/>Which brings me to his relationship with his father Philip of Macedon played here by Val Kilmer. One thing you can't have is whispers about paternity even if Zeus is the biological father which Queen Olympias keeps saying about her son. Angelina Jolie is Olympias and she's got a most tempestuous relationship with Kilmer. A few hints in that direction lead him to silencing those rumors and in turn a court party centered around Prince Alexander takes action to insure his successor.<br/><br/>Like so many adventurer/conquerors Alexander is convinced of the superiority of the Greek way of life. Still even after conquest he does leave local customs intact if for no other reason is that you can't keep leaving occupying forces lest you diminish your conquering army. A unique idea for its day, practiced most recently by General Douglas MacArthur when he was running Japan and quite well.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone offers some new and fresh insights to Alexander where we finally now talk about his sexual orientation. For those who protested this film, I say Alexander is here and queer."

","Regardless of the nice plays by actors and actresses,one of the things that surprised me,was that although the film carries the heavy title of a historic film it fails to do so in practice. When it wants to show the city of Babylon,the recreated images of palaces of Persepolis in Susa are shown. This weakness deems the hope of beside enjoying a film,having the joy of visualization of history. In great films like Cleopatra or Lawrence of Arabia you can get seated and let the movie tell the story of history accompanied by sounds and images. The film is made to portray an Epic but is lowered to picture an action story. Scenes and costumes are artistically recreated. Music and main theme is not as strong as it should be. Story of emergence of Alexander from a local king to a mighty one to attack an empire like the Persians is not properly pictured. The interesting trend in historic films that some lengthy parts or flashbacks are told by a narrator is not well felt in this movie. The great adventures of Alexander is limited to some battles and the course of life is not pictured well."

I was certainly not expecting a detailed historically accurate, roaring documentary and was more that ready to completely embrace any historical blasphemy.<br/><br/>This was worse than blasphemy, I saw it when it came out and was so utterly and completely demoralized that only now, in the middle of 2007 can I face this and think about the movie again. Please also understand that Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer can do no wrong. Yet I can’t remember, nor wish to remember almost anything about this movie. It is more than a bitter pill, as it also put the kibosh on Scorsese ""Alexander"" project with Leonardo DiCaprio, not that I had high hopes for that either.<br/><br/>Apparently the second greatest man to ever walk the earth must wait longer yet for someone great enough to tell his story.

","The Alexander I studied in history class makes barely a cameo in this movie.<br/><br/>The story goes like this. There is a man who is the son of a king who conquers stuff. We never really get a clear idea on why, but we know he does this, because people keep saying he's really great. The time line flips from past to future or present, and we never really know where exactly we are.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are few, far-between and and shaky camera work makes it so that it appears as though no one has any idea what is going on, the audience certainly doesn't.<br/><br/>Alexander, the one we all know and adore, The Great, makes about one appearance, and it's when he is twelve. He gets on that 'untamable horse' and rides it. I really enjoyed this scene. It was about the only scene I enjoyed.<br/><br/>And I don't blame the actors, except for accepting the script. The story itself was confused- it wanted, I think, to be an action movie, but then again, it wanted to be an epic, and oh yeah, they wanted to show that Alexander was gay, but then there's the fact that he wants his mom (who looks about the same age he does). Oh, and he's a good commander.<br/><br/>Oh, and to add to the drama, Alexander runs around acting like a wimp because he can't... actually, I never really found out WHAT he wanted, but he seemed to be sniveling on about something. Be a man! Go out and fight, or strategize, or SOMETHING! Don't just whine about it, DO SOMETHING. <br/><br/>I have to admit, I did find some humor in some of the more 'dramatic' lines. Okay, so there was SOME value, even if it was comic. In the end, the movie was an epic waste of time. The only scene I liked was the one in which Alexander rode that horse. And why didn't he and his little friend just DO it already? <br/><br/>Watch this movie if you have three hours in which there is not one other movie you could be seeing. Wait- scratch that.

Oliver Stone made Alexander out to be very different than he really was. my recommendation for anyone who is interested in Alexander the Great is, don't see this movie, or if you already have, then block out everything you saw because none of it is worth remembering. and for anyone who thinks this movie was an accurate portrayal of Alexander, they really need to read a few books and do their research. if Alexander could see this movie i think he would be appalled and Oliver Stone would not live long enough to talk about it."

","So were those Rosario's boobies, or were the stunt boobies? The reason that I have cause to believe the ""stunt"" theory is because in other movies she doesn't seem as well endowed as she seems in this movie. There have been posts on this page about casting decisions, skin color, etc. The only thing I care about is whether or not, they were pulling a fast one on the audience and replaced the boobies (this is an abhorrent practice). From this picture: (http://i.imdb.com/mptv1.gif) it seems like they tricked all of us. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed thinking that they were Rosario's.... Maybe I should keep my fantasy.

"mcewenks","5","2","4","27 April 2006"," This is the best acted piece of crap ever to hit the silver screen
","Alaxander is not an intelligent movie. From the director of ""Natural Born Killers"" one expects a certain level of directorial expertise that does not happen in this movie. Alaxander suffers greatly from pacing issues and an overly modern perspective of the great general. I found myself glancing at my watch before the first battle. Most suffering is thanks only to Oliver Stone's obsession with making the character homosexual and obnoxiously idealistic. His portrayal as a homosexual was not distressing from a historical view (Many Greeks and Macedonians of the time viewed women as child bearers only, not love worthy), but was instead distressing due to the immense focus it received. Alaxander became more a movie about same-sex love than it did about the events through his life. The biggest problem I had with the movie, though, is the terrible camera work during battles. Shaky cameras were overused to produce battles that looked as though they were filmed during a hurricane. Other artistic interpretations detracted from the visceral moments found therein. During the final battle we find the images have changed to shades of red, pink, and purple; not a good choice for any battle scene. <br/><br/>The acting, however, was brilliant. I was very happy to see Val Kilmer once again in a major picture. No one stood out as tacky in their portrayals and all did a phenomenal job. The character accents were obnoxious though (Stone's fault).<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone, there are far better historical war movies than Alexander."

","QUICK REVIEW: Bloody, wacky telling of a legendary world leader not really worth the plastic it's imprinted on. Think ""Natural Born Killers"" for the sandal-wearing era.<br/><br/>If this film presents what makes a man great, I'll take unaccomplished and pray that there's an afterworld where I can find some satisfaction out of my existence. That said, this movie seems to have skipped most of what made Alexander so great, going straight for the mental issues and blood lust. I would think that most of what showed in this film was the bad side and Stone's idea of a true story skipped most of the greatness in the man.<br/><br/>Movie where the only interesting acting (beyond film staples Hopkins and Plummer) was from Ms. Jolie. Serious historical look at Alexander? OK, the blood parts. Look up Alexander the Great on Wikipedia.org, guaranteed to get a better idea of who he was than this grisly, obtusely and graphically violent film. (The digital abuse of elephants in this film alone ruins the attempt, frankly.) Blood was part of his story, certainly, but my gut feeling is Stone may have imagined this a ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Braveheart"" with the staging of these battles for world dominance. He was wrong, as it is tiresome to sit through the warring scenes.<br/><br/>I find it not only hard to believe, but troubling, that Stone took years to develop this disparaging freak show. What's next? Rather skip it, myself, Ollie."

","Alexander is supposedly the 15 year pet project of director Oliver Stone so I have to ask . . . what happened? This is definitely Oliver's worst film to date if not one of the worst films I have seen recently. The story is so dis-jointed (including the action sequences which are presented as confusing at best - I couldn't tell during one of the first battles against the Persian Empire which direction the fighting was going on or who was who at certain points!), Colin Farrel was an okay Alexander, and Angelina Jolie was an unbelievable ""mother"" of Colin (considering their age difference is only 1 year!) - as a side note, her Transylvanian accent in this film was completely unrealistic for her character. The 175 minute length also is a negative. Oh, and that paper mache statue of Val Kilmer is silly if not funny (but not funny in a good way)! 4 out of 10."
"axopnk","2","2","4","13 December 2005"," Would have been good if it was a HBO special
","I'm only giving this movie a 2 because i thought that the structure of the movie would be perfect for a HBO special that went strait to video/cable instead of theaters. This movie really wasn't that great, it's kind of hard to give it any credit at all. <br/><br/>The first problem withthis movie (and the most major) is that it had an all star cast that ended up doing a mediocre job at best. This might have been OK for any of their career's earlier but at this stage with there star power, they simply didn't deliver(which shows Hollywood once again, like batman forever, that an all star cast DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK) <br/><br/>Oliver stone also did a horrible job with the action sequences, too much concentration on emotional aspects instead of the raw battle energy of troy or lord of the rings(like the whole red vision idea with the elephant fight was pretty horrible). The fights seemed unstructured and way to complicated. It was hard to figure out what Alexander was doing in the first fight, then to skip in between from macedonia center to out was strange. It didn't really explain how Alexander defeated a army much larger than his(as in reference to military genius wise). <br/><br/>Another problem is the story was too long in order to get to any fighting (which by my count is only 2). Oliver was trying to look at Alexander the man, focusing only on his character. The problem with this is you can pretty much figure out what kind of man Alexander is: 1 He's gay, 2: has a dream, 3: takes over most of world, 4: had mother influence, 5: liked his father. That pretty much sums him up, although it got interesting with him go crazy, they took to long to get to that stage, and took too long to get out of that stage also. <br/><br/>Secondly, was the timing of the film. It didn't flow nicely, you would cut into him as a kid, then him grown, a tragedy hits and next thing you know your viewing him 9-10 years earlier before that happened. Too much jumping around isn't great for the audience, especially after a major event happens (which the audience is waiting for what's going to happen next)only to cut back into his earlier years then zoom forward(once again oliver trying to focus on Alexander's past and character, which already has enough depth). <br/><br/>Val kilmer surprisingly was the best character in the whole movie, nailing down the father/king type perfectly. Angelina Jolie on the other hand did a decent job but the scenes with her in it could have been cut down drastically while still getting the same effect, emotion and motive out of the conversations with Alexander. Jared leto just didn't fit well in this movie, something about his face and voice just didn't give him a great role in the movie. Rosario Dawson did a decent job, can't really complain about her because she didn't have much of a role to begin with. Collin Ferrell basically did a horrible job, (then again when does he do a good job?). <br/><br/>Oliver really tried to push Collin to be a power figure like Mel Gibson of brave heart but also a leader role such as Russell crowe from gladiator. Collin's voice sounded whiny, he didn't have much of a look of a someone great, he seemed to put to much emotion into lines. Let's face it, certain actors do great in historical events (such as Mel Gibson, Russell crowe, Eric bana, somewhat on brad Pitt and Orlando bloom ((although kingdom of heaven was the same deal of trying to push a actor who doesn't fit the power figure great, still that movie was 10 times better than this.)) Orlando bloom easily could have been a better Alexander than Collin Ferrell. Anthony Hopkins is the same deal as Rosario Dawson. Not much of a major role so no complaints. <br/><br/>Overall this movie seemed like something out of a HBO special, which could have done well if it was a HBO special. Unfortunately this movie had to much expectations to follow a great hit like troy. In the end, this movie just isn't that good, so don't waste your time (2 hrs and 47 Min's is another complaint, way too long) or your money."

","Alexander was a good movie. I enjoyed mostly the first part of it, where they focus was on his childhood and early years.

Both Jessie Kammand Connor Paolo acted extraordinary well, living strong impression to the viewers.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed the scenes with architecture and nature as they really unfold the past kingdoms as they most likely looked like. Few days ago I had a conversation about this movie with a friend and he told me that it was a bit commercial  the Hollywood style  but I did not notice such a thing while watching the movie.<br/><br/>The music is well chosen, primary taken from the folklore of East European countries which seems to be a trend these days. Watch it carefully and you will see how the nature of the animals such as snakes, the eagle, the horse and the elephant is shown, in a way to give a more mythical look to the whole story.<br/><br/>See this movie and you won't regret it.

","Let me set one thing straight before I begin, Colin Farrel is NO Alexander. His performance was weak and mediocre. What a bad idea to cast him.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie really wasn't that good. It jumped between time frames too many times and had way too many sexual scenes between Alexander and his male lover. There is one good thing about this movie, and that's Angelina Jolie. Her role as his mother was spectacular. She deserves an Oscar for that one. <br/><br/>Also, the war scenes were too long, like the movie it's self, and were so confusing you didn't really know what was going on or who was who. And that caused me to lose interest and stray away instead of devoting my full attention to this jumbled jig-saw of a movie. It was as confusing as Eternal Sunshine, but didn't have an excuse because their movie wasn't about deleting memories. I could tell the movie also was trying to rip off Troy. I don't really have a reason for that I'm just saying it.<br/><br/>The scenes were too bloody. The movie was too long. There was too much gay stuff. And because Alexander was such a mean person I really felt more sorry for his horse then I did him when he almost died. 4/10."

Leto puts in an excellent performance, and Joile is gorgeous as usual. Surprised to see Kilmer so underutilized in his role. The less said about the editing the better.

It's even worse than other recent clunkers such as ""King Arthur,"" ""Van Helsing,"" or ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" and significantly worse than ""Troy."" In his remix, Stone removed 12 minutes. He should have removed around 45 minutes or more. Additionally, he moved two major scenes later in the movie, using them as flashbacks. It didn't work. It made an already confusing story still harder to follow.<br/><br/>Sometimes, hidden in a movie of this statue will be a gem of a scene or a performance so compelling one might feel a bit justified in watching it.

"almagz","2","2","4","25 August 2005"," A matter of priorities.
","In filming an epic about one of undeniably greatest military leaders of all time, it would seem obvious the emphasis should be placed on what may have made him so. A certain amount of creative (or speculative) licence on the part of writer(s) or director is understandable as the former may wish to imprint themselves on the finished product, borrowing, in a matter of speaking on the subject matter's immortality. Alexander's Freudian and bi-sexual aspects in Stone's production encroach so excessively into what may have been our hero's military prowess, that the focus of the entire movie seems greatly misplaced.<br/><br/>Male to male sex in Greek society is a given, even more so if we are going to consider these same men far from home for extended periods of time, in strange lands etc. Leonida's 300 Spartans were 150 pairs of lovers, but once one realizes that most, if not all, Spartan soldiers spent most of their time away from home taking care of each other sexually while their wives, daughters etc. engaged almost exclusively in Lesbian sex in their absence, the sexual habits of the famous 300 loses a lot of its story value. To further illustrate, Ceasar was bisexual and many Roman soldiers resorted to homosexual activity in Gaul and other frontiers because they found it preferable to having sex with local women who, by their standards at least, ""smelled bad."" Concentrating too much on these sexual aspects in treating either the Battle of Thermopylae or the Gallic Wars would readily be dismissed as ""prurient."" Why then should Stone's effort be exempt from this accusation?<br/><br/>Alexander's psychological complexities, destined at best to be speculative, result as being more indicative of the filmmakers' confusion than his own. Oedipal elements and accompanying Furies are liberally inserted and reinserted visually telling us he has problem, but when our anti-hero (super-hero-whatever) expresses himself both his speech and/or the excessive background noise negate whatever deeper understanding of the problem was intended . As was probably true, Alexander did draw parallels between himself, Achilles, and Hercules-in the former case maybe going as far as occasionally wearing a lion's skin, but this was if anything the result of already having become a dominant warlike force, not a factor contributing to it. Alexander was the cavalry leader in his father's army, perfected the phalanx, subdued and united (temporarily) Greece, conquered Egypt, founded Alexandria, and later Persepolis. Apparently, these things were not very important to Stone and time will bear out the error of his priorities.<br/><br/>There are nine nominations listed somewhere on here in reference to this movie. Four are, at least to me, rather obscure in source, and unrelated to either acting or script . Five are for the ""worst"" in an equal number of categories. It easy to dismiss this movie as a major mistake without being an homophobe. All too easy."

","This is possibly the biggest pile of garbage I have ever had the misfortune of watching. Where to start. Funniest thing was that Alexander was Irish. I never knew that. Thank you Mr Stone for enlightening me. I loved the parts which featured a young Alexander talking in a thick Irish accent. They must have had casting calls all over Ireland for that part. And how could such a wimp be one of, if not the greatest, military commander in history? I would'nt have followed him to the supermarket, let alone to India. And only two mediocre battle scenes? The second one in a lovely shade of red. I can't believe this film gets so many good reviews on here. There must be different versions of the movie in circulation. How could so much money and effort be put into this turgid, steaming pile of dung? I ended up fast forwarding a portion of the end of the movie to stop my misery. What a wasted opportunity, could have been an incredible movie. I wanted to see more angry, drunken elephants on the rampage. That is how they used to get them ready for battle. Fascinating. I wished to see more heads lopped off, more limbs severed (preferably mr stones), more spurting blood arteries, more sharpening of swords, more aggressive Greek people, more phalanx manoeuvres, more Irish accents, more make-up, more wigs, more talking, more eating, more talking, more ancient toilets, more verbalising, more elephants, and perhaps even an angry Alexander one on one with a mad, drunken elephant.

The 3 hours or so that this film takes to watch could be much better spent elsewhere.....however, saying that, Alexander is not a ""bad"" film, it is merely average. It is a fairly accurate historical epic that somehow fails to keep the watcher interested or remotely emotionally involved with the characters. The script, pace, acting, cinematography and more are generally average, while the narration makes the story disjointed and rambling. This film is mostly cited for the ""notorious"" homosexuality element, but in reality this is one of the few things the film does well.

So many fine actors, but a prime example of a good story told very badly. I'm not an Oliver Stone fan to begin with, but this was by far his worst effort to date. The only good note about this movie was Colin Farrell's presence, who showed audiences that he is indeed a fine actor who can easily lead a film, even a really bad one. It's almost as if Stone made this movie for himself, completely ignoring the fact that he took a piece of history that perhaps not many people were familiar with, and interpreted it only to his liking. Guess that's fine if your film isn't intended for the mass, movie-going audience. Wake up, Oliver ... you've simply remade a previous atrocious film (Any Given Sunday) substituting Greek soldiers for NFL players."

"Roving_eye","5","2","4","22 May 2005"," Played too safe
","OK, first things first. You're making a movie on Alexander with modern Hollywood technologies, and lots of dough, sponsors, consultants, the works... it is hard to make it unwatchable. But where I believe this fails to make even the annals of greatness is its pusillanimous approach to taking a stance on any issue of conflict. As a result the characters fail to form properly, and lack conviction. The movie proceeds as a dazzling display of the times. Alexander's character is way too safe. In reality he was far more ruthless, merciless and sadistic. Nowadays its kind of fashionable to show heroes as weak and emotional, and that makes this appalling. His marriage, his invasion of India and his war with Porus, his decision to choose the desert route back and his death are all unexplained. If you're simply going to narrate history with all its uncertainties and probabilities then make a freaking' documentary dude. If you make a movie have your own interpretation and get on with it. Playing Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy giving an account of the affairs was a pathetically defensive move, so the director could always get away wherever he wanted. The movie should have been first hand flowing along with Alexander and his mind. So what happens is that you always feel you are observing Alexander from the outside, but not observing and sensing and feeling 'with' him.<br/><br/>The thing I'd say is pretty honest, is that they didn't show Alexander making major victories or inroads in India. They showed it as it was, his army getting flogged at the hands of Porus. In reality Porus won that war, annexed some of Alexander's territories and sounded the retreat for the Macedons back home, their party was over. Of course again dilly dallying, the director does show the Indian army retreat in the end, again playing to the whims of historians as the way history should be. I saw a clip of Oliver Stone's interview about this film, and he says he always wanted to do it as a child and read loads about Alexander since God knows when. After all that their is a complete lack of any form of Judgement, originality and conviction. I am particularly peeved about his invasion in India and his death. Scenes just come and go without anybody knowing what is actually happening, nothing follows logically from the other. What actually happens after the war? Come to think of it at the end of it this movie leaves you with NOTHING! Just a dazzle of great shots and cinematography and a historic nostalgia of the times, which you get seeing any historic movie no matter which. It is for that reason I couldn't give this movie more than 5. Should you watch it? Yes, for all the money they spent on it. Apparently each and every prop was manufactured specially."

","I really, really wanted to like this movie. Shortly before it was released I was reading Mary Renault's Alexander books, and I was hoping the film would do justice to Alexander's life. It didn't.<br/><br/>What drove me crazy about this movie is that every once in a while I would see something I really liked, something that should have been cut out from the movie and pasted into a better one.<br/><br/>I liked what I saw of the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion, but at the same time I could almost hear the filmmakers whispering in the background, ""We don't need to have them kiss, do we?"" I had to sit through a creepy Alexander/Roxane sex scene but apparently Oliver Stone was afraid to have Alexander and Hephaistion kiss. (He claims that wasn't his reason. Frankly, I don't believe him.) It isn't as though men kissing is some incredibly daring venture. Merchant Ivory was doing it back in 1987.<br/><br/>I liked Val Kilmer as Philip, because he at least looked like he was having fun. I thought one of the early scenes of Alexander's childhood, when his drunken father enters the room unaware that his son is there, was well done...probably because it was directly out of Fire From Heaven.<br/><br/>In terms of visual imagery, it's a beautiful film to look at, Colin Farrell's godawful hair aside.<br/><br/>However, the things I liked weren't enough to make a good film. The Oedipal complex idea was fairly unsupported and campily overblown, and the accents were awful. (I heard Angelina Jolie's accent is supposed to be historically accurate, but it reminded me of a vampire anyway.) Alexander/Roxane literally scared me, and this is from a person who thinks Rosario Dawson is an incredibly sexy woman.<br/><br/>There's not much buildup or reasoning for the events that happen. They happen. There's some sort of melodramatic reaction to them. On to the next one, and we still don't know anything about the logic behind them, probably because Oliver Stone himself doesn't know the logic.<br/><br/>And as others have said, Anthony Hopkins and his long speeches were deadly boring.<br/><br/>If you don't have to spend much money to do so, see it once so you'll have a deeper appreciation for better films."

","Alexander: Directed by Oliver Stone, starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins<br/><br/>*Possible spoilers*<br/><br/>Yet another big budget epic, this time on the life of Alexander the Great. The film starts off with a young Alexander who is nurtured and cared for by his mother who is played by Angelina Jolie (and has this really annoying accent that reminds me of some old Bond villains). Every now and then this is cut into by a narration by Anthony Hopkin's character who is a king, about some 40 years after Alexander's death, and is citing the story to have it written down. Anyway, she cares for Alexander a lot but isn't getting along with his father King Philip (Val Kilmer). There are glimpses here and there of Alexander growing up with him talking to his father about Achillies, being tutored by Aristotle and him meeting his horse. But as he gets older, his mother tells him that he must marry quickly and get a child because Philip has gotten a new wife who is already pregnant and if Alexander does not do it, his and his mothers family will be in danger of losing everything that they have got. Then one night during a big party, Alexander gets into an argument with his dad who banishes him from his kingdom. Then, through some confusing way that I didn't really get and this is again supposedly explained by Ptolemy (Hopkins) but you have to pay attention really hard if you want to know what happened. This is the films first big mistake in which Alexander's rise from being a nobody prince and being banished from his father's kingdom rises within the period of about 10 seconds to some great general who is commanding a 40,000 man army against the king of Persia. A great opportunity to show the real rise of Alexander was simply thrown away. Anyway, he keeps on going east but despite his victories, conflicts arise with his followers who want to go back to their homes and don't like how Alexander is being nice to the peoples he conquered. And that basically takes up the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is confused by itself. This is because the movie never really understands, what part of Alexander's life does it want to tell. It isn't really a war movie since there are only two two battles and even those are quite shabby. It isn't really a love movie because even though there is romance and phenomenally pathetic gay relationships, that still isn't what the movie is quite about. The closest it gets to being about one thing are the conflicts between Alexander and his generals. There is even some unintentional humor in this turkey with Alexander supposedly being the one who discovered and named monkeys as monkeys while on conquest of India and being the first one to suggest the building of a canal through Egypt. I seriously laughed when these things were mentioned. The movie never achieves a really epic feel that was masterfully created in LOTR. I was hoping for a movie about great conquests and battles but this was much smaller and more about one man. <br/><br/>The sets and the costumes were colorful and plentiful so it was a slight feast for the eyes. The CGI was OK and fortunately there wasn't too much of it. The cinematography was somewhat inconsistent. For the most part it was good with excellent aerials and shots of beautiful scenery but then really went down the drain in some parts of the battle scenes. As for the battle scenes themselves, they simply sucked. There were a couple of good scenes but for the most part the camera was shaking like it was an earthquake and the editing so mixed up that you seriously couldn't make out anything but swords clashing and blood flying. They simply weren't captivating enough and there were too many scenes where the soldiers were just standing there even though it was supposedly a very intense battle. The soundtrack (made by Vangelis) was pretty good but the way Stone used it simple made the movie so melodramatic that it really made me grab my head at how can they have created something like this. Some movies can do this with style but Alexander sure is not one of them. <br/><br/>I am not going to say that you should stay away but I recommend that you'd be better off watching something else instead"

It reminds me of ""Black Beauty"" ( not ONLY because of the music ). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The dialogs are horrible! The last movie I've seen with such bad dialogs was ""Pearl Harbor"". I was expecting a historical movie, not a corny Love story between two men. The movie is way too much stressed to the relationship of Alexander and Hephaistion, so everybody talks about the gayness of the movie and not about the History of Alexander.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The role of Ptolemy as narrator of Alexanders Life takes away a lot of atmosphere. I hoped to see a movie about the ( political ) History of Alexander. How he grows to the greatest commander of ancient history ( from strategic and tactical view ) and esp. about the campaign through Asia. In one moment he's a 16 years old teen and then standing at Gaugamela. What about the Battle at the Granicus, the Battle of Issos ,his conquer of Egypt? They're all just mentioned in two or three sentences by Ptomely. What about the long march to Babylon and further to Persepolis? And one of the most disputed events of Alexanders journey was left. The burning of the temples in Persepolis! Those events are either left or unmotivated told by the narrator instead of making these the main events of ""Alexander"".</li></ul><br/><br/>FAZIT : The inner view of Alexander as a person is well done. And the ( rare ) Battlescenes are great, but the movie is missing a good balance between dialogs and events. But my greatest critics is about the dialogs itself. Who the hell wrote them? Perhaps they would do well in daily soaps but not in a historical movie for cinemas. So the movie makes a good portrait but most of the times bores the viewer with long non-happening scenes."
"turnipism","Null","2","4","8 January 2005"," Alexander the Rear Admiral
","Ah...finally a depiction of the life of Alexander the Great that doesn't bog itself down with his achievements. Despite having conquered Egypt, Persia, Babylonia, Syria, Mesopotamia and controlling Greece, Oliver Stone realized that the story of Alexander's amazing campaigns should be compacted into a manageable two battles. I mean, if you can tell me how Stone was gonna cram in another battle and keep the film within the 175 minute time-frame, I'd like to hear it. And what fine battle scenes they were. One was a confusing shaky mess in the desert where you couldn't tell who was winning, or if any strategy was employed. Sure, it would be simple to portray Alexander as an amazing war strategist, but wouldn't it be more fun to watch a confusing battle through the eyes of cameramen having seizures? Of course it would. And the other battle took place in India (hats off to Stone for finding the one patch of forest in the whole jungle) where Alexander failed. By the end of the movie, we had war crammed down our throats so much we could hardly think. I wish. <br/><br/>Actually Oliver Stone decided to take a more taboo route, to maintain his image of a groundbreaking director. The movie should have been called Alexander the Bi-sexual. Halfway through the film I was like, ""We get it! He likes girls and dudes! He's Greek, he can't not have sex with everything and everyone"" Sure it's nice to see Colin doing what Brad Pitt had been too afraid to do in Troy, but, c'mon, it doesn't take three hours to convey that Alexander has odd sexually tense relationships with his mother, wife, boyfriend, and others. I would have liked to have seen a movie beyond his bed chambers. It might have happened, but Stone was too busy putting eyeliner on Jared Leto or setting up the next sexually ambiguous encounter.<br/><br/>Also, even though he really tried, I think Colin Ferrel was a very poor choice for the main role. It's hard to see such a larger than life character when you're staring at an Irish guy in a wig for several hours. It kind of took away the realism for me, but maybe I'm just weird. And maybe the cast should have worked harder on their accents, while Jolie sounded like a Russian spy about to engage the enemy, Colin and his Macedonian crew sounded like a bunch of maritimers about to break into a little sailing jig. Like in this scene:<br/><br/>Olympias- ""In my womb I carried my avenger""<br/><br/>Alexander- ""Aww, leff me bide ya daft women. I had them ditties awl lass night and now em awl mops and brooms for shite. Naw give me a daight caike ter I give ye a douse in the chops.""<br/><br/>Olympias- ""Vhat?""<br/><br/>Sure it sounded completely wrong, but perhaps it was Oliver Stone's way of adding a bit of comic relief. The movie taught me that we can always sacrifice some historical accuracy for Stone's vision. Overall the movie attempted a difficult project and failed miserably. That could seem harsh, but when I see a potential historical biopic turned into scene after scene of Greek Newfies exploring their sexuality, I can't help but be disappointed."

Lord knows how long the movie then would have been.<br/><br/>There is no chemistry between Jolie and Farrel whatsoever, the combat scenes were chaotic and strangely bloodless. Everyone knows that Alexander were indulging in homosexual relationships, but there were no need to spend so much energy trying to portray that. I would have liked it better, had Stone chosen the path of Troy, where it was insinuated and nothing more.

"masyauefa","7","2","4","18 December 2004"," Not boring at all
","As expected from a 200M$ budget movie it looks absolutely clean, Hollywood style. Everything looks great and the cinematography is flawless. Now, there is a different between great cinematography and flawless since while the movie looks absolutely clean and good it had no memorial scenes and pictures. None. They showed Babylon in the most dreamy way they could and yet it felt so unreal and laughable. Looked like a stereotype. Too good which is bad. I didn't like it at all and it didn't match even abit the picture I had in my head for Babylon. And everybody knows that Actabana was the most beautiful city in the world, BTW. :D<br/><br/>Now the acting and the script which are tied together like siamic twins was the problem. Everything was way overacted but it seemed like the only way that the script would work. It's written in the most horrible way! The script tried to show how Alexander looked in real life but forgot to show what is known to us. And between us, who really care about his relationship with his mother, his gay relationship with his friend and his failing marriage??? I don't! I wanted to see the glorious battles and the brilliant military decisions! And what did I get? Two great battles and more then two hours of absolutely horrible showing of his personal life. And as I said everything was so overacted that I was laughing out loud in several scenes. Thank god that here in Israel the censor everything gay so the 20 minutes of the gay sex that is probably included in the movie wasn't shown. Thank you god!<br/><br/>But the two battles. As much as I would like to complain about how not quite realistic they were I still was absolutely thrilled of them. Both of them (in the start and the end) looked magnificent! And it's all due to the great direction of Oliver Stone. He did the best job he could with the battles and they came out absolutely different, absolutely symbolic (the rise and fall of Alexander) and absolutely thrilling. All the ""personal life"" and drama scenes were worth the watching because once they over you get the battles! And they alone make the movie worthy of watching.<br/><br/>But I won't be fooling myself. At no time I was bored! Yes, the acting and script was bad but they wasn't boring and they didn't ruin too much for me. The only thing that ruined the movie is how too many key moments weren't explained in the movie. But then again, Alexander is interesting enough, so go and grab a book!"

While I find most of Stone's work very good, this movie did nothing for me. It may have provided a real story basis about the life and times of Alexander. There is, however, absolutely no basis or foundation that Alexander was gay. Despite a wealth of research and writings which have had him as a subject, there is still no definitive account of the man's nature and or motivations. I think Stone wanted to brainwash or force his gay view on an unsuspecting or niave public. If I knew what I know now I would have never gone to see this movie.

I honestly don't think it was THAT bad. I don't really think that it was bad at all, just not spectacular.<br/><br/>The performances weren't Oscar worthy, but some of them were good, especially Colin Ferrell and Jared Leto. Those are two damn-good actors and I don't care what ANYONE says. All of their scenes together were very good, whether you can tolerate the ""gay"" factor or not, you can't deny the realness of their relationship. <br/><br/>I think that Angelina Jolie was pretty good, not as believable as I would expect from such a talented actress, but pretty good. Also, she DID age, to whoever said that she didn't. She sure doesn't have all those crows feet and gray hairs, that she had at the end of the movie, in real life. And as far as her being close in age with Colin, let's not act like Angela Lansbury didn't give a magnificent, Oscar nominated, performance as the mother of Laurence Harvey, who is only 3 years younger than her, in the original ""The Manchurian Candidate"". Of course Angelina's performance can't even come close to Angela's, but the age thing is doable.<br/><br/>My bottom line is that it wasn't this years best, but it was MOST DEFINITELY not this years worst. I enjoyed it for the most part, with special accolades to Colin Ferrell, Jared Leto, and the always brilliant Anthony Hopkins... Good movie, not great, but Good movie!!"

","Alexander (2004) ** Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto, Rosario Dawson, Christopher Plummer. Oliver Stone's long-gestating biopic of the legendary Greek conqueror is a divine mess with a sorely miscast Farrell (in one degradingly awful blond-tressed wig after another; at one point he resembles Wham!'s Andrew Ridgeley !) as the conflicted young emperor who attempted to rule the known world with nearly 90 percent of it under his command but for a hefty price including his life. The logy, bloated (clocking in a shade under three hours) sleep-inducing pace is the worst of the production's sins as well as some hammy acting by Kilmer as the cyclopean father, King Philip and Jolie affecting a decidedly Transylvanian accent as the scheming snake-fetish femme fatale mother Olympias yet the battle sequences prove to be inventive and at times rousing (especially the climactic India skirmish replete with elephants) but the damage is done in the cringe-worthy screenplay by Stone, Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis with some howlingly awful dialogue and a badly handled attempt to suggest bisexuality on Alexander's behalf with Leto's Hephastion. An epic misstep indeed."

","I really don't know what to say. As a history lover, this movie is a total disappointment for me. Everything in the move is terrible. The film starts OK but as it progress it jumps right to the Battle of Gaugamela scene.I really want to ask Mr. Oliver Stone, what happened between 342 BC to 331 BC? There are so many other great battles (How Alexander conquered Eagypt, Battle of Granicus, The Battle of Isus) and none of them are in the movie. The Battle of Gaugamela is a huge military success and the battle was won with a great strategy but in the movie the great Battle of Gaugamela is just a simple battle that was won against 250000 Persians.

","Alexander (***½ out of five)<br/><br/>Warner Brothers presents a film directed and produced by Oliver Stone and written by Oliver Stone, Christopher Kyle & Laeta Kalogridis. Music by Vangelis. Running time: 170 minutes. Rated K15. Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto, Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Val Kilmer. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone's Alexander awakens mixed feelings, as it's a magnificent story about Alexander The Great (Farrell) with an off-the-track cast but Stone fails to deliver the answer to what he is asking from us. The question he presents in the film is how Alexander became the Great but the answer we get is actually what made him want to be the Great. Contradicting his own material isn't a good sign but in the end, I must say, Alexander is a decent epic story of a history's greatest legend.<br/><br/>Alexander the Great is known as one of the greatest military leaders, who by the age of 25 had conquered the known world. Alexander had a twisted relationship with his mother, Queen Olympias, (Jolie) who loved her son more than anything else in this world and hated her husband, Phillip (Kilmer), and Alexander's father more than anyone else in the world. To Olympias Alexander is the son of Zeus and Philip is a rapist barbarian. Her life depends on the greatness of her son.<br/><br/>Alexander was raised in the middle of the stormy relationship of his parents but was able to rely on his best friend, Hephaistion (Leto) who was his companion and a lover in his life and during his conquests. Alexander built an army and an empire more stronger, vast and powerful than any other, while other army commanders became an object of mistrust for Alexander and it was them who fought for power after Alexander's mysterious death at the age of 32. The empire he so passionately had built collapsed because his dreams were bigger than it was possible to realize.<br/><br/>What Stone has directed is a history lesson of thee hours length and does not look to entertain the audience but embodies Stone's point of view on the subject matter. We can praise Stone for taking the project seriously but there is and obvious flaw that Stone has not understood. Instead of trying to cover the whole life of Alexander, he should have taken a more limited perspective on the conqueror's life. This would give more space to understand Alexander and not build his life and character on the narratives by Ptolemy (Hopkins). What we want is to see, not to hear.<br/><br/>The story has a focus on the young leader's journeys across Asia with few well realized battle- scenes. Troy was a good example of awfully boring battles that didn't really have any emotional attatchments - and even lesser blood. Exactly, Stone's film isn't about handsome hunks entering a bloodless war zone  even when people are brutally killed - without actually being injured. Alexander is more violent than the epics (LOTR, Troy, King Arthur) we've seen lately, and it fits perfectly here. The unfortunate side of the less-is-more on the war-aspect, is that we don't really get to see his abilities as a leader and a strategist, or a politic. Stone indeed doesn't realize to include the most important aspects of his superiority.<br/><br/>But if you think of this film being about what made him want to be the leader of the world, then you'll be pleased. Alexander's desires are a result of his relationships with those who he loves, and<br/><br/>well, doesn't love. Angelina Jolie shows her teeth as the vicious Olympias, after a string of disappointing performances in the past two years. The scenes between Jolie are Farrell are powerful as they are electric. Val Kilmer is the pleasant surprise as the barbaric father of Alexander, who has more vast look at the world around them. But Farrell himself doesn't have the qualities of a great legend but thankfully the cast surround him works so greatly. And what would the film be without Vangelis, whose orchestral score is pompous but the eastern melodies (Roxane's Veil with Vanessa-Mae !) are the secret ingredients making the food even more delicious.<br/><br/>The Stone-directed epic has some big flaws but the journey we experience is worth seeing at, and at best Alexander is great and at worst just decent but never boring or bad. The cast (except for Farrell) offer worthy performances. One disappointment is the lack of daring scenes between the lovers Alexander and Hephaistion. Sure there's plenty of homoerotic scenes, which is unusual for a big-budget epic but Stone hasn't had the courage to show them even kiss when the pair frankly demands for it! Alexander certainly isn't the usual package you'd expect and that's why it's so interesting. Greek culture is served with a golden plate and the drinks are ice cold!"

Angelina Jolie is not even a year older than Colin Farrell in real life, yet she plays his mother.<br/><br/>4. The ""gay"" men in the movie wear more eyeliner than hookers.<br/><br/>5. Colin Farrell has blond hair in the movie, yet his roots are brown, along with his eyebrows. Did Revlon exist in those days?<br/><br/>6. An eagle is inserted or referenced to for really no apparent reason.<br/><br/>7.

Val Kilmer's eye looks like the makeup job a kid would do on himself for Halloween -- that, in itself, makes it scary.<br/><br/>11. The sex scene -- why are Colin and Rosario hissing and growling at each other like a couple of rabid dogs in heat?<br/><br/>12. Rosario's accent -- ""You...lav heem."" Why?<br/><br/>13. Why do they portray Rosario's character (Roxane) having the comprehension skills of a 3 year old --<br/><br/>Alexander: ""We'll talk about this later.""<br/><br/>ROXANE: ""Later. Talk.""<br/><br/>14.

You see the respect the character has for civilizations older than his own, and you appreciate the contempt his detractors have for him due to their own material interests. You see his arrogance evolve to cast a shadow over his dream. You see him ""die"" (metaphorically) and be reborn to return to his senses. You see race hatred. You see a vision of utopia.

","I've read a number of the comments on this list, so just let me add this one. Perhaps, if you are not familiar with the history surrounding Alexander the Great, you might want to do a little research on the topic before you see this movie. The themes and tones may not be for you. I've been reading about Alexander since I was in high school (many years ago) and when I went into the theatre, I expected to see Hephastion and the relationship they shared. I already knew the story of his horse, Buchephalas (sp. sorry) and I knew of his rocky ""disfunctional"" family. None of those things took me by surprise. I was even pleased to see such small things as the scene when the Persian princess addressed her remarks to Hephastion instead of Alexander, mistaking him for the king, and all Alexander's companions snickering over her error, but with his classic charm and grace, Alexander gently tells her not to be embarrassed, because Hephastion ""is Alexander too.""<br/><br/>I thought Oliver Stone was incredibly true to the story and told it with style and such incredible attention to detail! Those of you who were expecting a modern day ""adventure"" film completely missed the telling of the story of one of the most brilliant and complex men who has ever lived! If you thought Oliver Stone made this stuff up, go to the library and read the stories for yourself! Insofar as we can believe the ""histories"" written 2350 some-odd years ago, the movie was true to the legend that became Alexander.<br/><br/>The actors were brilliant. I've never been a Colin Farrell fan until now. When I read they'd cast him in the role I was horrified. He was magnificent. Leto was a soulful Hephastion. I even liked old Angelina!<br/><br/>See the movie with an open mind and a little pre-preparation, and I think you will understand the subtle and yet gripping way Oliver Stone told the story."

I waited for something decisive to occur, like maybe the cutting of the Gordian knot, but that wasn't scripted. Instead, I saw rebellions rise and fall like dormitory quarrels, odd leaps forward in time with awkward leaps backward too, and three or five interchangeable battles that consisted of blurred horses' flanks, hack and thrust, and weapons for show not use (pikes, much in evidence, are for foot soldiers to use to stop cavalry charges, the ends braced on the ground, not as seen elongated spears for waving in the air or throwing like javelins, fer goodness sake!). Even Vangelis music couldn't invest the flash-editing with excitement, because who could tell who won, and who cared).

","When the mighty fall, it is from a greater height. So it was with Alexander the Great, and so it is with Oliver Stone's ""Alexander."" Here is an ambitious and sincere film that fails to find a focus for its elusive subject. Stone is fascinated by two aspects of Alexander: his pan-nationalism and his pan-sexualism. He shows him trying to unite many peoples under one throne while remaining equally inclusive with his choices of lovers.<br/><br/>But it remains unclear if Alexander has united those peoples or simply conquered them, and his sexuality is made murky by the film's shyness about gay sex and its ambiguity about Alexander's relationships with his ""barbarian"" bride and his tigress mother. We welcome the scenes of battle, pomp and circumstance because at least for a time we are free of sociopolitical concepts and the endless narration of Ptolemy the historian, who functions here like the Bill Kurtis of antiquity (""No tyrant ever gave back so much ..."").<br/><br/>The facts are quickly summarized. Alexander (Colin Farrell) is the son of Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer) and Queen Olympias (Angelina Jolie). As a boy, he sees his drunken father all but rape his mother, who for her part insists Alexander's actual father is Zeus, but doesn't give details. Young Alexander impresses his father by taming an intractable horse, but both mother and son are banished from the kingdom, Olympias advising her son to seize the throne before Philip has him murdered. As things work out, Philip is murdered, and Alexander rules Macedonia.<br/><br/>Still a very young man, he sets out to conquer the known world. Told by Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) where the world ends, he finds it keeps on going, and so he keeps on conquering, defeating the other Greek city states, the Persians and all the other peoples he confronts until he is finally defeated not so much by the rulers of India as by India itself. He dies at 32.<br/><br/>He is, in Stone's version, remarkably open-minded for a tyrant. There are many scenes in which he debates strategy and goals with the members of his army, something we cannot easily imagine Philip (or Gen. Patton) doing. He takes the Asian bride Roxane (Rosario Dawson) instead of choosing a nice Greek girl as his advisers recommend. He spends eight years in battle, taking with him his army, their wives and lovers, their servants and households, in a sort of movable empire. And always smoldering in the shadows is Hephaistion (Jared Leto), his closest friend since childhood.<br/><br/>In ancient times, we are told, powerful men often took men or boys as their lovers, reserving women for childbearing and suchlike. Alexander seems to be following that tradition to the extent that Stone (and perhaps the MPAA production code) will permit it. Hephaistion doesn't even go through the motions of taking a wife; he is always there for Alexander -- but for what? They have looks like the beginning of a love scene before it fades out, and the rest of the time, they hug a lot.<br/><br/>As for Alexander's sex life with Roxane, it is not surprising but nevertheless worthy of notice that we see a great deal more of her body than Hephaistion's, and observe them during a sex scene that begins with her fighting him off and ends with them engaged in the kind of unbridled passion where you hope nobody gets hurt. All right, so they have great sex -- once. Then we learn that three years pass, and she provides no male heir, although for all we see of them together, the fault may be Zeus's.<br/><br/>It's clear enough that Alexander loves Hephaistion and has married Roxane as a political gesture. In that case it is a miscalculation by Stone to make Hephaistion into a pouting sideline figure who specializes in significant glances the significance of which the movie does not explore, while making Roxane into such an exciting hellion that we're disappointed Alexander doesn't let us spend more time with her, even if he doesn't want to. Dawson's Roxane is truly sexy, but Leto's Hephaistion is not allowed to be seen as a male beauty; he looks like a drag queen, with more eyeliner than Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra. If Stone is not willing to make Hephaistion at least potentially as erotic a character as Roxane, he is not really engaging the logic of the story.<br/><br/>The ambiguities are not assisted by Colin Farrell's less than wholehearted embrace of his bisexuality. He goes after Roxane at first with the gusto of a rugby player, but approaches Hephaistion with a solemnity that borders on the doleful. Nor is he convincing as a conqueror. Farrell is a fine actor, but on a human scale; he's not cut out for philosopher-king. One needs to sense a certain madness in a colossus; George C. Scott brought it to Patton, Peter O'Toole brought it to Lawrence, Klaus Kinski to Fitzcarraldo, Mel Gibson had it as William Wallace, Willem Dafoe had it in Stone's ""Platoon,"" but Farrell seems too reasonable, too much of ordinary scale, to drive men to the ends of the world with his unbending will. Of other actors Stone has worked with, perhaps Woody Harrelson has the strange light in his eyes that the role requires.<br/><br/>The running narration by Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) is a road map through three decades of history, but there are so many names, places and dates that finally we want to ask, please, sir, will this be on the final? Perhaps the narration is supposed to bridge gaps in the disjointed narrative. Even so, at one late point, the movie comes to a jarring halt with the title ""Macedonia -- Eight Years Earlier,"" and we get a flashback to scenes involving Philip that don't feel like a flashback at all, but more like material plucked from its place in the chronology and inserted later to clarify what the filmmakers fear we will not otherwise understand.<br/><br/>Alexander and Ptolemy both talk a lot about incorporating conquered peoples into the expanding empire. Their clothes, languages, foods and customs are embraced, we hear, but the movie spends more energy telling us this than showing us. Even though the movie's battle scenes are impressive and sometimes brilliant, Alexander's opponents have the human dimension of video-game figures. They attack, are vanquished, are replaced by new foes. The battles in India are masterful, with Alexander's men and horses terrified by war elephants, and an earlier battle against the Persians at Gaugamela has scope and grandeur. It looks as if there might be real men on the ground, instead of the digital ants in ""Troy."" But we don't get a sense of the humans on the other side.<br/><br/>To mention Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy,"" the early-2004 epic about Grecian myth, is to make a comparison necessary. ""Alexander"" far outreaches ""Troy"" in ambition, its action scenes seem at least conceivably plausible, and it is based on ideas, not formulas. Yet ""Troy"" tells a story that has some structure and clarity, and those are precisely the qualities that ""Alexander"" lacks. The parts don't fit together in ""Alexander."" Transitions and segues are missing, and we seem to be looking at disconnected parts from a much larger whole: two wholes, perhaps, one involving Alexander's military and political careers, and the other his confused emotional life.<br/><br/>While we can at least process the problems in his marriage with Roxane (he lost interest), we are left baffled by his tangled relationship with his mother. Angelina Jolie seems so young and sexy as Olympias, especially in scenes involving Alexander, that we wonder if she will start raiding cradles instead of tombs. She hates Philip, and no wonder, for he is a drunken lout, but are her hopes for Alexander entirely geopolitical? She regards him in a way Roxane never does, and one of the reasons for the ""Eight Years Earlier"" flashback is to get her back into the film after a too lengthy absence.<br/><br/>I have always admired Oliver Stone's courage in taking on big, challenging films, and his gift for marrying action and ideas. ""Alexander"" is not a success, but it is ambitious and risky, and incapable of the inanities of ""Troy."" Fascinated by his subject, he has things he urgently wants to say about Alexander, but his urgency outraces his narrative; he gives us provocative notes and sketches but not a final draft. The film doesn't feel at ease with itself. It says too much, and yet leaves too much unsaid.<br/><br/>S."

","Baz Luhrman had been planning to make a movie on 'Alexander The Great' featuring Leonardo Dicaprio and Nicole Kidman. However, as Oliver Stone's movie was running ahead towards completion, Luhrman's project got shelved. Stone's film has received tremendous flack for various reasons.<br/><br/>I could tell that the movie was trying to be as historically accurate as it could given the limited running time but the writing is still quite bad. The monologues keep rambling on and on. Stone also uses some clichéd elements like the irritating background score and the excessive makeup. Even the camera-work was ineffective at times, especially in the battle scenes. The sex scene was quite funny. It looked passionless, silly and dare I say, juvenile (and that's not how it was supposed to appear).<br/><br/>I did like how Alexander and Hephaistion's relationship was portrayed. There were hints of homosexuality but Stone never puts a label to it. Alexander's relationship to his mother was also interestingly displayed as a love-hate relationship of sorts. However, seeing Jolie and Farrell play mother and son was awkward. Couldn't Stone have found an older actress for the part? In my opinion, Colin Farrell was a good choice for the title role. He does the best with what he's given. If he's limited in any way, it's due to the writing. If one can overlook the fact that she plays Farrell's mom, Angelina Jolie acts very well (except in a few scenes where she's unintentionally funny). Val Kilmer and Jared Leto are quite adequate.<br/><br/>'Alexander' could have been a great movie. It's not as bad as what many have made it out to be.

","First of all, my impression after first watching it was that the movie was tediously long. I do understand that condensing the history of Alexander the Great's lives, times and conquests into a two to 2 1/2 hour movie format would be impossible. Indeed, there were so many significant events of his history that were not developed in the detail that it should have been. I did think that Oliver Stone, who tends toward politically-tainted revisionist history (JFK, W, Platoon, etc.) did a well-researched and accurate version of the history of this ancient figure. I truly believed his motivation for the film was an interest and love for ancient history. I was impressed by casting: Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy, Christopher Plummer as no less than Aristotle, and Val Kilmer as Alexander's father. (Spoiler) The film was not without controversy as it focused on Alexander's bisexuality (not historically inaccurate) and his rather Oedipal relationship with his mother (Angelina Jolie was not a good casting decision in my opinion). This gets 5 stars out of 10 in my book because, again, it didn't hold my interest for the entirety of the movie. Other lengthy movies with historical settings don't usually have me wishing that it wouldn't drag on so long."

"webmaster-3017","4","0","0","30 June 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: Alexander
","Tagline: Alexander the Great, but Oliver Stone the CRAP! Some people fight for country, some fight for themselves and some don't even know why the hell they are fighting for, even when they are remembered in history as the single greatest commander in the whole of ancient and perhaps even modern world. He was a conquer, a hero in hearts of historians, he was Caesar's superior times a hundred (where Caesar wept at his statue of his great accomplishment at such a young age). Thus, he was a truly a heroic person. However, this movie, and I mean it, from the weird and eerie director – Oliver Stone, Alexander is a confusing and gay and uneven movie. And that's from someone who has always admired Alexander and has done research on him 5 years ago. This movie without the battle scenes is a total waste of 3 bloody long hours and is the movie confusing? I bet you it is! Why the hell did someone like Stone portray Alexander as so bloody gay, why can't he realize that in Ancient Greeks times, it was a norm thing, so why not just leave it out, as he did to many great achievements? Personally I have nothing against gay, but Alexander was a HERO – an inspiration, he was famous for his victories – the way he won the bloody battle not for his relationships with whoever it is. To me personally, Stone directed a bad and uneven movie, and not only that – he is not showing his so-called HERO with any respects.<br/><br/>The movie is full of problems – not just that thing but more than that – there is no female lead, the only one is a mother of Alexander – Jolie, but other than that it is just bi-sexual and gays. No offense, think about it? Who knows about Alexander? Who can be certain of his life? Let alone his achievements? Nothing is certain in Ancient History that is what makes it fascinating. In real evidences, I mean primary sources – which they don't have a lot, I tell you from a historian and non-bias perspective that there is no real evidences to suggest how Alexander really die and whether he was gay or not. So why the hell did Stone do this to his god-damn HERO? Well I guess that he was just confused then.<br/><br/>However the battle scenes are the absolute saving grace and geez it was beautiful and stunning to watch, from the opening scenes against all odds to the terrific artistic finale that draws and copies from Jet Li's Hero and a dramatic and exhilarating slow motion horse run kill. That shows him as a real HERO, but apart from that few scenes and that ½ an hour the movie is almost dead. Comparing him to Achilles an imaginary or fictional character is stupid as firstly this movie is shittier than Troy and secondly Alexander is by far and more human and better than him.<br/><br/>Although Collin Farrell is one of my favorite Hollywood actor, this is a wrong move for him, although his acting is somewhat good for the stupid direction, it is clear that he was confused in playing the role. One moment he seems gay another moment he is not, and tell me if I am wrong – Alexander was not a confusing person, but one with such a mind that none of the greatest commanders can equal – not even Caesar, nor Napoleon! Angelica the so-called husband stealer famed by the media, was wasted in an eye-catching sexy performance playing SM with a snake (well at least that's what I though she is doing).<br/><br/>Seriously, Mr. Oliver Stone, your movie was a total failure and why didn't you just go and donate that amount of production cost to the Tsunami, or just sent it straight to video. Did you know that I tried hard to ignore the critic reviews, because I always admire Alexander? To see this sort of crap about my HERO is not only heartbreaking, but just absolutely disappointing! Ancient History is all about analyzing evidences and forming new opinions, sure Stone tried to do that, but when even the Vangelis music is crap – surely something is wrong. Perhaps it is just Neo, but when a blockbuster like this – ended up with just 30 odd million in US, I guess I am not the only one standing on this. As an ancient history lover, a hero of mine – my heart is shattered and what I really wanna do right now is not to have my money back but I am willing to pay you another movie ticket so that I can forget such a BAD movie.<br/><br/>I rate it 4/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","Because of the success of Lord of the Rings and Gladiator, historical epics have become big business. 2004 became the year of modern sword-and-sandal epics, Troy, King Arthur and Alexander. On paper Alexander should have been Oscars gold, it had a big name director, Oliver Stone and it's about possibly the greatest general the world has ever known. Sadly, the film was a flop.<br/><br/>Alexander looks at a few key moments of Alexander the Great's (Colin Farrell) life, the death of his father Philip II, the conquest of Persia, his marriage to Roxana (Rosario Dawson), relationship with Hephaestion (Jared Leto) and mother Queen Olympias (Angelina Jolie), his fail conquest of India and his rebellious army and generals. It is show in flash-forwards and flash-back, and shows how Alexander goes naive in Persia, becoming more Persian then Greek, leading to conflict with his generals. It also shows his drive to conquer over anyone who challenged him, and set out to unite the world. He wanted to make a united world where people were treated equally.<br/><br/>The Revisited version is 3 hours 30 minutes, a very long film and much of it is wasted. Instead on forcing on the politics and the military aspects, the film ponders and becomes very boring. The film skips over important parts of Alexander life and some of the most important battles and reasons for the war were missed. It does not show that Alexander turned Macedonia from a backwater to a superpower of the ancient world. The other major problem was the story being told in a non-linear way which is confusing and pointless, the film should have been told straight like most films. It was also confusing with the large number of characters where you don't even know their names and couldn't care less for them. The casting of the film is extremely poor. Colin Farrell is a very poor actor general and unconvicting Alexander, Rosario Dawson played her role like vampire, why? Angelina Jolie is normally a good actress, but she was too glamorous for her role in a modern way and her accent was strangle, the casting director should have just casted an actress in her late 30s, early 40s from Germany or Eastern Europe. Jared Leto was underused, he hasn't got the roles he deserved after the great Requiem for a Dream. Surprising, Val Kilmer, an actor who is normally as wooden as tree, wasn't bad in this film. For a film that tries to be realist, it's a very camp bit of film-making and has some terrible dialogue, over-the-top accents and unnecessary dancing and partying.<br/><br/>The saving grace of the films is the very realist, brutal battles, showing how tough warfare would have been. It was well done, but they were only two battles in the film. At times they seemed like Rome: Total War the film, but there are juicy bits as well. They should have been more fighting.<br/><br/>Hopefully there will be a good Alexander the Great film in the future. It would also be good material for a HBO miniseries. As well, Oliver Stone needs to find his mojo again."

Alluring Angelina Jolie (as Olympias) is a couple of decades too young to play the mother role throughout, but she does. Veiled Val Kilmer (as Philip) is unconvincingly half-hidden, under an eye scar. Alexander digs men and women with heavier eye make-up.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the performers do not come across as well as you have a right to expect, under Stone's direction; in particular, the title character lacks Alexander's certain je ne sais quoi. Anthony Hopkins (as Old Ptolemy) performs double duty, as a semi-omniscient narrator (which works better in the original, theatrical version). Films with too many ""narrative"" interruptions are not, in general, successfully telling their stories visually.<br/><br/>However, Mr. Stone more than earns an ""E"" for effort; his ""Alexander"" definitely evidences the many individual strengths of its cast and crew. The main battle scene is very well done; Stone successfully employs his great poetic violence, with an increasingly blood-red drenched infrared lens, marauding elephants, and slow motion. After this excitement, the remainder of the film moves along briskly, and effectively. Alexander's main relationship, with Jared Leto (as Hephaistion), is not fleshed out; he beds both genders, but is only allowed to hiss like a lion, on-screen, with wifely Rosario Dawson (as Roxane).<br/><br/>Who knew either Stone, or the Greeks could be so prudish? <br/><br/>****** Alexander (2004) Oliver Stone ~ Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer <br/><br/>Good grief!

","Alexander is one of those movies you'll either hate or love. I actually partially enjoyed this movie but it does have many flaws. First off I have to say the battle scenes were excellent-a lot of action, blood, gore etc. However only two battles actually took place in Alexander disappointing a lot of people who wanted to see something like Gladiator, Troy, and Braveheart.<br/><br/>I honestly could only watch this movie by forwarding the majority of the film to get to the battles, however I loved to watch the battles again and again. The acting in this movie is for the most part pretty good but could have been better in some of the characters.<br/><br/>The story was a bit confusing and a lot of the times I was wondering what was going on in the film. My advice to anyone who wants to see this movie is to not expect something like the other epic war films you've seen before and prepare for a lot of non-fighting and in my opinion awkward scenes. I do advise that if you are watching this movie for the first time to have a little patience because the battle scenes are pretty impressive and use decent CGI.<br/><br/>The main reason this movie isn't as highly-rated as epic war films like Gladiator, Troy, or Braveheart is that you will probably find yourself forwarding most of the movie to get to the good parts.<br/><br/>My Rating: 6.3/10"

","How do you make a film about one of the greatest generals of all time leading a dazzling military campaign that led to the conquest of the known world? If you're Oliver Stone you don't. Instead you treat your viewers to an intimate psychological profile of the man: how he thought, what moved him, what were his dreams and aspirations. Sound boring? That's because it is. But that doesn't mean that it's not interesting. If anything, Oliver Stone proved that he has the balls -so to speak- to push the envelope, scoffing at -mostly American- viewers' latent homophobia. Well, historical evidence seems to point that he was in fact bisexual. Why is that a big deal? Mainly because Stone allowed it to become a big deal. For crying out loud Oliver, he wasn't just a bisexual -or ""pansexual""- King who loved another man. He conquered the freaking world and all you offer us is two battles. Gloriously directed as they were, they are not enough to give us a sense that Alexander was in fact ""Great"". Stone let Alexander the person dominate the film, when he should have balanced him out with Alexander the soldier. In anticipation for the Final Cut DVD, I'm giving this a 7.

","Although the producers tried to present Alexander and classical Greece as realistic as possible, they still went a bit overboard in a few important instances. I was surprised that they decided to present Alexander as more fond of boys unlike they did in Troy where Achilles was never seen in any of his famous homosexual pursuits, but it did add to the realism. I also enjoyed the antagonist motherly figure that was presented as the hidden force behind Alexander's glory and his weaknesses, but just like the homosexuality, it was a bit exaggerated and was taken too far.<br/><br/>The Greeks that speak with Irish accent was definitely not necessary. I wasn't sure if I was watching some sort of a Celtic conquest adventure or a story of Hellenic glory. The attempt at making the movie more artsy and inverting color during the best battle in the movie was out of place as well. For me at that point in turned into a cartoon. Some scenes were cut and pasted in the middle of the movie when even though they were quite important to the storyline made no sense in the particular context. Most important conquests and exploits of Alexander (e.g. his first conquest and first few victories as well as the story of the Gordian Knot) were not even mentioned. This disjointness and selective development of Alexander's story prevented me from enjoying the movie completely, but I thought it was still a lot better at presenting Hellenic world than the Hollywood's last attempt with Troy.<br/><br/>This movie is far from a masterpiece of even a must see. It is too long, sometimes too pointless and often more than not drags its own feet in a circle without saying much, but it's still not a terrible movie and is somewhat entertaining on the first run.<br/><br/>6/10"

Anyway, that should have been sufficient warning, but no, I stayed, and all too soon my perverted appetite for bad movies kicked in. I wish I'd had court-ordered unnecessary eye surgery under local anaesthetic instead of having watched this. Better memories.<br/><br/>I was prepared to accept the whole Greek thing with the love between men, I really was, what with Achilles and the begenitalled statuary and the American Puritanical prudishness and all, but I was not prepared to sit through what felt like six hours of spycam at a gay Hollywood cast party. I know where to go for that sort of film if I want it. I don't.<br/><br/>Prurient excess aside, to portray Alexander as a modern queer is laughable anachronism. Who knows what he really did? But he certainly must have been a bad-ass warrior with a lust for life and for combat that would seem almost insane to us, and not the gloopy, moody drama queen this movie makes of him. You can't command an army, much less an empire, by force of angst. Stone's Alexander is a silly caricature of perhaps the greatest general the world has ever seen.<br/><br/>I didn't want this review to be about the homosexuality thing. The movie stinks enough in other ways to rate a scathing pan, but blame Stone, not me. This movie is nothing more in the final analysis than a slap-dash apology for the gay-rights movement."

","Alexander didn't do great in the world - lots of people laughed at it and gave it bad reviews, the acting and accents were generally bad, there were only two action scenes in the whole film and it should have been more intense. Old Ptolemy, who told the story, was just a boring old git who tried to make it sound like he actually cared about Alexander, but knew deep down he didn't really.<br/><br/>But one good thing about this film - it definitely deserves to be called an epic. Though there isn't much action in the whole film, the battle scenes are done beautifully and with great visuals - Alexander himself actually fights like he wants to. There's lots of blood, and it's better than anything Troy or Gladiator have to offer, though they both are generally better films in most other aspects. If it had had more furious battles, I would have liked Alexander more, though it is mostly boring and hard to watch - it tries to build up character, but fails. So, two hours of the film are wasted, generally speaking. But the death of Alexander's father was pretty well done.<br/><br/>On the whole, Alexander does not have the makings to be great - the acting is wooden, the script isn't great, and most of it is pretty laughable. If you must, rent the DVD and just watch both main battle scenes - they are truly great, and show that Oliver Stone can direct well. But this film has marred his career, to be honest - I am wanting to see his latest film, World Trade Center - let's hope that is better. Not great. 6/10"

There must have been a lot of international financiers contributing to the expense of this film. Although I never saw the film in the theater, I gave the DVD to my husband for his birthday. Later, I liked Rosario Dawson in Clerks II and wondered how she acted in Alexander. (I know enough not to say ""appeared"".) She was great! I started to watch the DVD whenever I could, a few scenes at a time, and found that worked for me. I liked the flashbacks. They were absorbing, footnoted what had just happened, what was about to happen. Colin Farrel and Jared Leto inhabited what must have been arduous roles. I hate saying this but I remember Jared Leto from his Camryn Diaz days, left adrift on the red carpet as flashbulbs burst around Camryn. But, in this film, Jared shows he has acting chops, playing a tortured, sad character. The film's sociology was interesting. I liked how the film showed life on the road, how Macedonian soldiers started families and spawned kids along the way. Alexander cared for them, too."

","Alexander is an ambitious project, whatever one may think of its shortcomings. The script has a hard time pinpointing what makes the great man tick--and it's certainly muddled when it comes to all the conspiracy theories surrounding his youth and manhood. His mother is played by Angelina Jolie as a conniving temptress with an uncanny control over snakes--a control she has over him as well, urging him to become the great leader in battles.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell does the best he can with the florid dialog, full of pomposity and Shakespearean grandeur, but it's not a part that he really embodies with any great conviction. He does a workmanlike job but never really becomes the character. Nor is his relationship with his lover (Jared Leto) ever given more of a hint than intense glances can convey, as if Oliver Stone was reluctant to let the homophobic aspects of Alexander's life interfere with the storytelling.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are realistic but fatiguing after awhile, following the accepted strategy of other action films by interspersing fierce battles with the quieter moments--but never too quiet since most of the dialog consists of arguments between Alexander and his army of dedicated fighters.<br/><br/>Val Killmer gives a vigorous performance as his father Michael, almost unrecognizable in his one-eyed make-up and red beard. Anthony Hopkins serves as a one man Greek chorus, narrating the tale in the manner of a bad DVD commentary. Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Aristotle, teaching the Greek youths about their mission in life.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the background score by Vangelis is strikingly effective, as is Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous cinematography. The look of the film is one of its strongest assets with authentic detail in costumes and settings. But the script is a yawner, going back and forth in time to fill in gaps that were intended to fill the viewer in on some missing points. It's a technique that tries the patience several times throughout the lengthy running time.<br/><br/>This should find favor with a very limited audience of history buffs."

","Cinematically, I give this movie exceedingly high marks. The primary characters in this movie didn't grab me, it was the outstanding supporting roles, including that of Alexander's horse. Cleitus was hands down, my favorite character and met the most tragic, undeserving end one can imagine from such a faithful and devoted man.<br/><br/>I thought Val Kilmer did a great job, as did Sir Anthony Hopkins. Angelina Jolie was strong as well, except for that bizarre accent, which sounded more like that of someone who just got off the boat from Montenegro, not Macedonia. Colin Ferrell did a very respectable job in this role and it appears as if he's just not come into his ""avante guard"" own among the US critics yet. He did a fine job and turned in a more than worthy performance.<br/><br/>There has been much mention made on this site about the use of Celtic accents in the movie. This was obviously intentional, inflicted for the sole purpose of giving the film a Shakesperean tragedy feel to it. If it was acceptable in a series as brilliantly produced as I Claudius, why is it unacceptable in this medium? That wasn't bothersome to me at all - Jolie's accent was atrocious. The only accent that bothered me was the heavy Scots accent during a dispute between Alexander and one of his oldest generals - I couldn't understand a freaking word the guy said. <br/><br/>This movie would have been a nice cinematic history lesson, were it not for Oliver Stone's incessant need to constantly interject conspiracy theories into every single movie he creates. He is very tiresome with the never-ending rubs he throws in there, the evil, racially intolerant generals, liberal vs. conservative nuances, which of course, ends in a lesson being that the one who supports diversity is the martyr, regardless of whether or not the espousal of such a notion during that period in world history was catastrophic. The inference is that Alexander was poisoned through treachery - in reality, it took Alexander 12 days to die - there was no known poison of the period that took more than 1 day to claim its victim. Perhaps this is why the critics didn't like the movie - historically, it is dishonest. Perhaps I am not the only one who's grown weary of Oliver Stone."

Still the movie was interesting and somewhat enjoyable to watch. Alexander contained only two battle scenes which were portrayed very well and in a violent manner. They were interesting and good camera angles were used. The movie contained lots of homosexual references which makes stupid narrow minded people cringe. Unfortunately they were only references. I wish Oliver Stone would have been more daring with this issue. The biggest conqueror of all time was gay or at least bisexual. Get over it. <br/><br/>Some scenes could have been made shorter in the movie but the only completely unnecessary scene was the long heterosexual sex scene, so all the jocks could masturbate over Angelina Jolies ass and titties. How about a proper homosexual scene to make up for it? Or how about just leaving that scene to the cutting room floor?<br/><br/>In the end Alexander is not great. Instead he is quite mediocre."

","It is hard to understand Oliver Stone's choices. The gifted director who made probably one of the best Vietnam war movies, the intriguing director of 'The Hand' and 'Natural Born Killers', even the programmatic director of 'JFK', and now this? 'Alexander' looks too much like a big studios historical epics of the 60s, but this is no 60s any longer, and without daring to say loudly what is different 'Alexander' fails on almost any plan.<br/><br/>There are certainly a few different ideas in the script. One of them is a modern interpretation of the story of Alexander, with some contemporary implications. This part fails, mostly because it does not find any credible translation in cinema language. Being left with commentaries about 'guerilla war' in the mouth of 4th century BC characters cannot make a credible case. Another theme is about the ambiguous sexual orientation of Alexander. As legends whistle the story for milennia, as books throw the rumors of his homo-sexuality to footnotes, so does Stone, probably as result of Hollywood puritan politics, and here is the source of another failure. What we are left is with an inversion of focus, with Alexander's mother becoming sort of central or at least driving character in his life's story, and here we must give credit to Angelina Jolie for succeeding to play a powerful and dominant mother role, with the exception of the funny accent which only Stone and her hold the secret (maybe).<br/><br/>There is too little good cinema in this film, and too much off-screen commentary and theater dialogs. Only for a few moments like in the flash-back re-creating Alexander's father assassination are we reminded what a fine director Stone was and maybe will be. 'Alexander' however, will be missing from the list of his best movies."

","On the one hand, I admire the effort to make one movie of the life of Alexander the Great. On the other hand, it is seemingly one conquest after another, featuring very bloody battles, and at almost 3 hours takes great effort to remain interested. I am not a student of history, more of an observer of history, and from what I can gather from a bit of 'net surfing, the story depicted here is pretty accurate. However, I believe I would have been more interested in a movie based on one very interesting part of his life, rather than all of it.<br/><br/>The technique used for telling the story requires various flashbacks, some 10 years earlier, some 9 years earlier, etc, which makes good viewing if you pay very close attention. However it doesn't always work.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins was my favorite as Old Ptolemy, who we see at various times telling the story. In that sense the whole movie was a flashback of his story. One of my favorite Hopkins roles was as John Quincy Adams, former president, in the movie ""Amistad"" (1997), where he delivers a fine, long monologue near the end on ""freedom."" Here in ""Alexander"" he delivers several good monologues.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was uniformly good. Colon Farrell as Alexander was young and fresh when he needed to be, and bordering on insane when he needed to be. Angelina Jolie was good as his scheming mother Olympias. Val Kilmer as his father, King Philip. Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, young Alexander's teacher.<br/><br/>In a time when leaders fought and captured other countries because they could, bringing wealth home to share with others, Alexander is depicted as a leader who genuinely thought it would benefit the peoples of those other lands, to be ruled by him. He also was depicted as homosexual, perhaps encouraged by his father who told him as a young boy that women cannot be trusted, only fellow men.

","I went into this movie with high hopes; after all, I was going with my Classics Club. It isn't a horrible movie, and it gets kudos for being an epic, but compared to other epics it falls vastly short. I will address the things which held this movie back from greatness.<br/><br/>Run time: Yes, this is an epic, yes the story takes a long time to tell. But the plot line itself was simply not captivating enough to hold an audience. We are left to wonder at points, ""where is this going?"" Not so much in terms of what will happen, but why it matters. There were several points where I thought the film was wrapping up, but then it just drug on some more. The message of the film was hard to grasp. I think Stone tried to do too much in that regard. He was trying to make too many allusions and connections from Alexander to various mythical legends that we get confused.<br/><br/>Gratuitous sex: I have no problem with sex in films, especially when it's relevant to the storyline. Yes, I know that Alexander the Great had homosexual tendencies. I don't see anything wrong with portraying these in the film, but instead of being a part of the character, at times it seemed to be all there was. It was almost like the film felt it had to PROVE just how gay Alexander was, and I felt this unnecessary. There was also a lot of nudity that was there for the sake of nudity, not the art of the film or the storyline.<br/><br/>The biggest drawback was the lack of a clear direction, theme or message to the story. We all know what's going to happen, if we know the historical accounts, but that shouldn't stop us from enjoying the ride. In this case, it seemed like an overly long and pointless one.<br/><br/>As to the ""bad accents"": This did not bother me a lot. I understand that this was not a portrayal of true Macedonian or Greek history, but rather a stylized portrayal similar to ""Julius Ceasar"", ""I, Claudius"" and the like. The cast was predominantly from Great Britain, and elements of that were strong in the film, but it worked.<br/><br/>There were good things in this film, mostly technical. The costuming and portrayal of the places Alexander conquered were beautifully done, especially the battle scenes in Persia and India. You really get a feel for the cultures Alexander comes into conflict with. The color and look of the film is highly stylized, and a little too artistic for some, but this is overall an artsy movie.<br/><br/>I'd recommend seeing in once, preferably on a large, wide screen.<br/><br/>And as an off comment, the makeup proves that any guy in black eyeliner is hot."

","Alexander the Great in this version of the Macedonian hero is much too soft for my tastes. Richard Burton previously played this role and in my opinion, played it too hard. I hope just right will eventually make it to the big screen! Colin Farrell has the appearance and physique well mastered in his presentation of Alexander. Statuary and busts of Alexander confirm that Colin is an excellent choice to play the role. However, Connor Paolo was excellent in his presentation as the young Alexander who tamed Buchephalus, and who asked questions of Aristotle. He should one day be considered to play a mature Alexander. I am very impressed with him, and perhaps Colin could play his father Philip then.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was quite fetching as a well-groomed and ever properly fashionable Olympias. I do not think that she caught her character at all, however, as Olympias is a fascinating woman, but in this particular characterization, she is simply smothering and manipulative, hateful, and vindictive. I did not like this portrait of her at all.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer is a capable performer who gives a convincing performance of a drunken and dominating Philip. He is not served well in later scenes, which only made me think of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar ghost appearances.<br/><br/>Jared Leto as Hephaestion is simply not in the correct look of a commander who becomes second only to Alexander himself. I would have preferred Andy Richter even to this effeminate version of the famed best friend to Alexander.<br/><br/>Ptolemy was simply dreadful all the way through. Nothing good to say so will say nothing more.<br/><br/>The character of Kleitos as played by an actor name of Stretch is very interesting to me. He did very well as did the young man who played the role of Philotas. However, neither character is given any real lines or character development so essentially they fizzle.<br/><br/>Rosario Dawson as Roxanne is the most disappointing performer in the movie. She was given a bad rap in my opinion. First of all, it is said that Roxanne and Alexander fell in love at first sight. Roxanne in this movie acts like a victim of foul play instead of a blushing bride, and I disliked Oliver Stone's idea of a trashy wedding night. Sorry for Rosario as all her nudity did not add one bit to the wedding scene, but she is a great dancer as seen in the dance that she performed.<br/><br/>Won't give in to the bad mixing of historical facts as all are all thrown together in a mixed bag, and come out dreadfully poor.<br/><br/>Those of us who really like Alexander don't much care for this version of the great heroic character! If Oliver is truly a fan, I can't tell it by this corrupted version of Alexander's life.<br/><br/>I also meant to comment on the various versions of the film being distributed, a single theatrical cut, a director's cut, and the special edition cut. <br/><br/>I own two versions: the director's cut, with the bonus feature of the Transformation of Colin Farrell into Alexander, and the Special Edition, 2 discs. The better disc to purchase is the Special Edition as it is more complete, has better commentaries by both Oliver Stone and Robin Lane Fox. The single disc has only Oliver Stone in his commentary. Be sure to buy the special edition."

Triumph after triumph only fueled Alexander for more, but his army was getting weary of this and wanted to return home. I kept rooting for them. I was getting weary too.<br/><br/>The acting is good, but too many main characters (Hopkins as Ptolemy, our narrator; Kilmer as Philip, Alexander's' father) spoke for too long too many times and this helped some boredom to set in to a point I lost interest in what they were saying. And, I became weary of listening to Alexander going on and on, too often, to justify another campaign. These long soliloquies really serve no purpose but to annoy. Maybe that is why the army bent to Alexander's wishes to push on. It was easier than having to listen to another venting.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were excellent, despite the nervous cameras making me dizzy, but they went on too long as well. If it weren't for the FF button on the DVD Player, the battle scenes would still be playing.<br/><br/>The movie was in a nutshell, way too long, and tedious. And, it's not always okay to try and make our heroes (Alexander) more human to us. But, couple that with long winded utterances, and never ending battles the more-human Alexander is not all that appealing. Do we really need to see all these human frailties? What purpose is served? To show that he wasn't so great? Huh?<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie played a good part as the Queen and mother who wanted Alexander to find a way to kill off Philip and become king. Of course, Alexander is resistant to this as he loved both parents. But, the movie absolves Alexander for any part he played in his father's murder. Was this the truth? Hmmmmm."

Perhaps the two brilliant victories engineered by 'ATG' against Darius, against a vastly superior Presian force.<br/><br/>One last note. Angelina Jolie should make a pilgrimage to Greece to thank the all the ancient gods that Olympias never met her daughter-in-law, Roxan, face to face.

"rparham","5","0","0","7 August 2005"," Pointless epic
","Alexander is the most plodding, uneventful historical epic I have ever layed eyes on. Directed by Oliver Stone, he transforms the life of a major historical figure, Alexander the Great, into a muddled mess of a film, teaching us nothing of the man, not to mention his great quests.<br/><br/>It had been public knowledge that Alexander the Great had been a pet project of Stone's for a long time, but after viewing the results it's hard to believe that Stone gave much thought to who this person really was. The film meanders from scene to scene, focusing first on Alexander's tempestuous relationships with both his mother and father, moving on to his victory against a superior Persian force at Gaugemela, his travels Eastward, eventually to India, finally his return to the city of Babylon and his undoing. Yet, as much as the above description seems to suggest that Stone covers Alexander's life, in the end I don't really feel as if I know much of anything about Alexander or those around him.<br/><br/>Alexander's narrative is revealed via a voice-over by Alexander's associate Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) many years after Alexander's death, recounting the tales of Alexander's exploits. He tells of Alexander's early life with his mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie), and his father, King Phillip (Val Kilmer), who are at each other's throats, although the film is never clear why. Alexander grows to manhood, in the guise of Colin Ferrell, and continues to have a contentious relationship with his father, and seems to start one with his mother, until his father dies, and Alexander sets out on a quest to bring those that he believes are responsible to justice. This leads to the battle with the Persians, and Alexander then moves on to conquer what is the known world, while at the same time, bringing civilization to the world.<br/><br/>It is said that when a long movie is good, you never notice. Well, Alexander isn't one of those movies. Alexander seems to go on forever, scene after scene, with little or nothing interesting to offer the audience. Alexander appears to want to tell us the life story of the man, but frankly, he stays undeveloped. Yes, the film pays lip service to Alexander's desire to educate the world and bring civilization to those viewed as barbarians, but these are just words. Alexander features scene after scene where characters argue with each other, which seems like drama, except that these characters aren't really saying anything. The dialogue is just words pouring out because they need to. The characters say nothing of value.<br/><br/>There is a lot of attention paid to Alexander's bisexuality, specifically his attraction to Hephastion (Jared Leto), his longtime companion, but there is no interest to be generated from this relationship, or any other. There is no sense of chemistry or love, and later when Alexander takes a wife in the form of Roxane (Rosario Dawson) she serves as just window- dressing; again, there is no development of the relationship.<br/><br/>In any historical epic, you usually expect some epic battle sequences, any while there are some attempted in Alexander, they are woefully inept. With no real interest in the characters, the battle scenes just go through the motions, providing no excitement or energy to the film at all. The second half of the film mostly focuses on Alexander's trip east, but the supporting characters are all undeveloped, ciphers with little or no personality, who are all interchangeable. When the men rise up in mutiny, and some Alexander's associates are implicated and killed, but their deaths mean nothing to us. There is some lip service payed to Alexander's relationship to his father and mother, but it all adds up to nothing, really. There is no sense of why Alexander defends either at any time, as they are both rather unappealing characters, and all Alexander seems to do whine and complain about both at different times, making look like a wimp, not a powerful ruler.<br/><br/>The film also passes over major developments in his life, skipping major battles and lightly covering a major misstep when Alexander moves his soldiers through the desert in one scene. One gets the impression that Stone wanted to cram so much into one film that he glosses over many events that should prove instrumental to Alexander's life.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, Alexander is a major failure, and an enormously disappointing film. There was a great deal of interesting material here, but it is all wasted on a bloated epic that proves to be pointless."

The movie seemed out of kilter for me most the time with the endless flashbacks and skipping over of most of the history to spend too much time addressing the ""gayness"" of Alexander. The Homoerotica didn't need to be so blatant in my opinion. I liked the several battle scenes, although, the dust in the battle of Gaugamela took away from the view. I guess this was to hide the CGI deficiencies, but I'm sure some will comment that it could indeed have been that dusty. It would have been good to show the battles of Granicus and Issus or the battle at Tyre with it's causeways and towers that Alexander's army had to build. Even abbreviated to set the scene with the final battle at Gaugamela against Darius. Also, it would have been neat to see that there were Greeks fighting with Darius against this Macadonian. The battle of Hydaspes against the Indians with their elephants was pretty good. Overall, the photography was good, acting pretty good, plot line was not fluid....and we were not let down by Director Stone when he threw in the conspiracy theory surrounding Alexander's death at the end.

Philip was an alcoholic, and Olympias did dig snakes (""Keeping real snakes in the house of an alcoholic is not a good idea. It just complicates matters."" -- Will Cuppy). (Possible spoiler) That Olympias didn't seem to age could underscore her potential ""supernatural"" reputation, as presented in the film.<br/><br/>On the minus side: historic detail. Not only did we learn little of Alexander's military strategy (rather than seeming to know exactly what he was doing, we just see him as impulsive and headstrong). Further, prior to his battle with Darius, Alexander was overmatched in manpower by Darius, but Darius had troops up all night roaring defiance at the Macedonians to unnerve them. But that also exhausted his own men, leaving them to go into battle sleep-deprived. This was all overlooked in the film.<br/><br/>The movie jumped around in time, and thus we're deprived of many of Alexander's conquests, such as Egypt (which explains, as the film doesn't really, how Ptolemy became Pharoah). As a general, Alexander was a military genius, and this isn't clear in the film.<br/><br/>The epic of Alexander, as has been noted, included the fact that he could be as brutal as a velociraptor, but only his good side was shown.

I'll let the viewer/reader make their own analysis.<br/><br/>Plot Summary -- CAUTION SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>Alexander leads an outnumbered army of 40,000 into, what is probably now Iraq, which defends with 200,000 or so people. The motivation for going to war is ambiguous, but loosely based on revenge. Because they have better technology, more war experience, and because they are following an eagle, they chase the evil leader out of Babylon. When they march into the kingdom of Babylon victorious, the citizens rejoice and celebrate, cheering for Alexander. Then they continue into the mountains to the northeast, most likely present-day Afghanistan, where they are only a few hours too late to capture the war-lord leader they were chasing. They find his body, presumably betrayed by his followers. Alexander continues to kill off the remaining rebel armies in the mountains of afghanistan, before continuing to India. <br/><br/>In India, they flashback 8 years to when Alexander was made King, after the previous King was killed, and nobody really said anything about it. His becoming king is very conspicuous, as he is declared king at the moment by the people around him, not by the previous King himself. Back in India, (8 years later) his followers turn against him twice in protest for ongoing wars. Once, in front of the Indians, he has his homosexual experience in public, and contrasted with the Indians, he and his army look stupid. Later, he makes a speech rallying people together for another war and asks that they follow him for another month. He kills everyone who speaks out against him. Then leads them into another war, this even more meaningless than the others. Only there, are they beaten so badly, that Alexander has a change in heart. They return home, where his right-hand man is killed by poison. <br/><br/>He mentions going back to war in Arabia. The people rally behind him for a while, before he is finally killed. Some years later his successor is also killed, along with his family. At this point, the empire collapses into several fighting factions, as nobody is appointed to take the throne, and there is no existing leadership that people all agree with.<br/><br/>Great film, wonderful parody. I laughed several times. And unbelievably timely."

","I saw this movie this weekend and found it to be a bit slow. I just wasn't expecting what I found. I knew that Alexander the Great (as well as Julius Caesar) had epilepsy by that was not mentioned at all - they seemed to be focusing on his sexuality. I'm still not clear if he was bi-sexual or homosexual. He did marry and have a son but in the movie that was mostly for an heir.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were confusing and left you with a feeling of ""Who won?"" I was really surprised my Val Kilmer - I didn't even recognize him! They did a really good job with his makeup. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was way too young to play Alexander's mother once he got older. They didn't even attempt to age her until the very end and then they did a poor job of it.<br/><br/>It makes me wonder how much was accurate from historical records and how much was Hollywood."
"blue_mage3000","Null","0","0","28 November 2004"," So what if there are gay scenes?
","(Some spoilers)<br/><br/>I'm somewhat disturbed by the amount of people raging on about the few gay scenes in the movie. I don't see anyone complaining about the scene with Roxane and Alexander, which was rather graphic considering that she was naked and that they eventually had sex after she attempted to kill him. Apparently viewers think this is fine, but the few scenes between two men who truly love each other are a travesty. Stone wasn't just trying to show that Alexander was bisexual. He was trying to tell the story of the relationship between Hephaestion and Alexander. Therefore, more than one gay scene is necessary.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie. It wasn't the best, considering the accents, some of the cheesy lines, and some of the bad camera-work, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I thought Stone did a decent job, considering how much material he was trying to fit into the film."

","I liked this movie. Unlike Troy it gave a pretty fair picture of the time and the myths. People seem to complain about the ""gay"" stuff, but I really don't see why!!?? this was in a time when the word gay did not exist. As I understand it, the only person that we know ""for sure"" (nothing is ever ""sure"" in history) was Alexanders lover, was his slave Bagoas (though we might assume the women he married were his lovers as well)... Hephaistion is assumed to be so (or so I've read) because they prayed to Achilles and Patroclus, who people (at this time)belived were lovers. That is it. He might have loved both men and women, and it is shown (at least a little bit) in the movie. Why is it such a big deal? What is the problem??? <br/><br/>Anyway, The battles were okay (exept for the music) I liked that the warriors actually got scared, like real people do. I thought it was going to be more of a ""hero"" thing, romantic and noble - and it was, a little bit - but it still felt more ""realistic"" than most movies like this. Olympias accent bothered me a bit. And a few other things... but I liked it. More true to history than a lot of other movies I've seen."
"litlthread","Null","0","0","28 November 2004"," The Alexander Connection
","After watching this film I sat for some time, trying to determine exactly why I hated it so much. Since my brain, in an act of self preservation, shut off during hour two this took a bit longer than it otherwise would have. <br/><br/>I decided to go back to the reason I went to the film in the first place. Before I watched this movie, I liked Alexander. I was intrigued with his life. There is this dichotomy to his character.<br/><br/>Alexander is considered great for two very different accomplishments: conquering most of the known world and promoting cultural and intellectual world communication. If we stop to think about it, he is really respected and revered for the latter much more than the former.<br/><br/>Stone's film falters in that it seems to focus almost entirely on Alexanders military exploits. One of the two only other diversions he pulls out to break the military monotony is a ""perhaps"" homosexual relationship? This was Greece! Of course, he had sex with men. Due to the very low estimation of humanity afforded women in Greek culture the ideal relationship was with another man. Stone, I believe, also attempts to draw the audience to Alexander by throwing in bizarre family dysfunction but really, when was the last time you fantasized about your mother? This is also used to try to explain why Alexander fancies men which seems to imply that Stone, at least, believes homosexuality to be a sort of mental disability.<br/><br/>There is nothing in this film with which we can connect and sympathize. This failure to connect with Alexander is infuriating because, before this brain eating zombie of a film, I admired him and identified with him. I can only hope that the other Alexander films reportedly in production will touch on the aspects of his life that connect him to all of us.<br/><br/>For example, Alexander was trained from infancy by his father to be a warrior. There are tales of how Phillip kept predatory animals on the grounds to promote fearlessness in Alexander. From the records, one does not get the feeling that Phillip was free with his praise and declarations of love. This, of course, seldom makes us love our father's any less and sometimes causes us to be consumed with winning their respect or love. We're starved for some sort of validation and the only person who can satiate us is the one who inspired that need. <br/><br/>How haunting is that image of Alexander? He conquered most of the known world in a futile attempt to win the admiration of a father long dead? It is pure speculation and perhaps even transference but that hasn't stopped historians in the past and certainly doesn't seem to be a problem for Stone.<br/><br/>At least it's something to which an audience can relate.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Alexander was a student of Aristotle. He was chosen to continue a school of thought which began with Socrates. He sat at the feet of one of the greatest philosophers in history and, it seems, developed an appreciation for knowledge. Not only the knowledge of the written word but also that which can be gleaned from the people and cultures that surround each an every one of us. <br/><br/>One could speculate that Alexander would have preferred to spend his life if quiet thought but, due to the aforementioned need to prove himself to his father, went out conquering as was expected. He could have been unifing cultures and building his library and temples to knowledge as a way of justifying that warrior existence to himself or perhaps his teacher. <br/><br/>The question would then be, did it balance out? Was Alexander the Great an egomaniac or frustrated with an addiction to gain power? He conquered and defeated but for what did he use the power he collected? Many would say, the enrichment of mankind. Was that enough? Was the greatest conquerer in western history, arguably the single most powerful man in western history, ever happy? <br/><br/>This is the character arch I wanted to see. This is the side of Alexander to which I can relate. Stone had three hours to convince me there was something about his Alexander I liked, something for which I wanted to cheer or cry. Instead I am left mourning the loss of my limited and precious time."

","First off, I'd been looking forward to this movie for a couple of months. I for one thought the trailers were very well done and made the movie look truly epic...because that's what they're supposed to do, so I applaud whoever made them. However, I always try to keep an open mind when I go to the movies, especially refraining from high expectations. Then I read a couple negative reviews and I wasn't sure what to think when I sat down. Three hours later, I think I can give you a good idea of what this movie is like...<br/><br/>I'll start with the story. I found it to be very sporadic and it meandered quite a bit. We start off at Alexander's death, then when he's four, then when he's twelve, then when he's eighteen, then jump about eight years, then another three, then back eight or ten years, then forward two, then forward ten, then forward forty. It's not like it was hard to keep track of, but it just got a little annoying.<br/><br/>As for the acting and the portrayal of the characters, the best word that comes to my mind is BOMBASTIC. Each line seemed like it was supposed to be this monumental, emotional line, and the ones that were delivered with all the emotion the actor/actress could muster seemed incongruous for the moment, most notably all the lines that were used in the trailers. It seemed as though the writers wanted you to be moved by every word spoken, and that just drains you, no question about it. Much too serious. There was some overacting, but it may have just seemed that way since the script called for Colin Farrel to cry every twenty minutes. As for the homosexual scenes, I found the love story interesting, even if all the conversations between the two seemed the same. I was moved at the end when Hephastion died, and then Alexander let himself fall to be with him.<br/><br/>As for the action, yes it was very good and very bloody. Of course, that's how it was back then, and that's how it should be portrayed. The only thing that bugged me about it (and this is something of a personal thing) is how it was all so quick and clip-show like. Sometimes you weren't really sure what was going on exactly, except that spears were being plunged through people. But then again, that's all you really need to know.<br/><br/>I've been reading many of the negative reviews, and I have to say that, in my opinion, historical accuracy, when broken down to such a small fragment, shouldn't be such an issue when it comes to films. If you wanted an accurate historical re-telling, you should've watched the History channel. This is a movie. Some things have to be sacrificed in order to keep with the direction. Had Stone filled in all the blanks he missed, and yet stayed with the ones he didn't, many of you would be complaining about how the movie was six hours long instead of three.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this movie is worth seeing once, if you want your own opinion on it (don't bash a movie you haven't even seen)."

","I gather from most of the comments and reviews that I've read that most people don't think a great deal of Oliver Stone's life-long dream film epic. My thoughts are at odds with each other. This film is definitely worth the cost of a cinema ticket. Colin Farrell is phenomenal. Truthfully I never knew that he is such a good actor. The battle scenes are horrifically graphic and violent. The references to Alexander's bisexuality are subtle, for which I am grateful. It's my understanding that much of the sexual content of the film was edited out. While I admit that I am pleased about that I also cannot help but wonder something. Something is missing from this film, but I am unsure what. Usually when I think something is missing from a film I can pinpoint it to one thing: character development. But ""Alexander"" does NOT lack character development. I think it could relationship development, which was probably present before editing. I cannot be certain, but I have the inclination that this is probably the case. In any case I still am of the opinion that this is a good film that is worth seeing. (That is if you can stomach the gore and the implied sexual activity between Alexander and the eunuch.) I'm just grateful I didn't have to watch Colin Farrell kiss Jared Leto! I'm pretty sure that would have disturbed me greatly because neither of them is gay to my knowledge, and no one is THAT good an actor!"

","Man, I don't know where to start with this one. I am so baffled when a big name director puts together a project and then I spot the little errors that take me out of the film. Why can't Ollie put some time into looking and listening to the film, because...<br/><br/>I wasn't sure where I was. England? Ireland? Scotland? America? This group had such a mix of accents, it just drives me up the wall. Colin has never really impressed me with his grip of the American accent, and the English apparently was out of his reach as well. I thought he would have a great English accent, but no, just Colin's Amerirish. The best accent is near the end, with a guy who sounds like Sean Connery. Okay, whatever Ollie.<br/><br/>Who decided that Colin's and Angelina's tattoos were okay poking through the make-up? Someone just say, ""no one will notice, his arm ain't that big"". 'Cause whoever did, doesn't understand that when it is on the big screen, it is, well, uh...BIG. So, the tattoos distracted me, but maybe not as much as the skull cap on Anthony. That one just made me laugh. I respect sir Tony, but why not just dedicate to this role like you have done in the past with so many others, and shave your head? Too much to ask?<br/><br/>That's about it. The shots with Anthony outside were...fake looking. I don't know the way to describe it, but it was like certain parts of Planet of the Apes (modern), where the film stock or lighting or something, gave it a phoney 1960's TV look. BTW, if someone know's what I'm talking about, and there's a word or phrase for it, let me know.<br/><br/>Outside of that, it was okay. I wasn't expecting greatness, but it makes me wonder what went wrong and where? This baby should have been top notch with Oliver behind it, but no. It's the little tiny details that give films like the LOTR Trilogy the final touch that separates them into greatness. Ollie, go sell crap somewhere else, we're all stocked up here!!"

","I really did not really feel that strong an emotional link unlike other movies of this type like Gladiator. In movies like that you somehow sympathize with the main characters through their sufferings and victories. <br/><br/>In terms of storytelling there were a lot of events that I wish the filmmakers could have done better. The battle scenes were too little considering the area the actual man had conquered. Also there were a lot of areas during the battles were I got confused. It was really hard to see what was being done and how it affected the battle. <br/><br/>There were also some scenes which I though could have done in a grander scale considering how events in the history books described it. Events such as the crossing of the Hindu Â– Kush, as well as the battle with Darius.<br/><br/>I thought the props and visual effects team did a good enough job in setting part of the tone of the film. The make-up team did a good job in transforming the soldiers as the effects of many battles were clearly shown.<br/><br/>I thought this was one of Colin Farrell's better acting performances. He did a fine job in portraying the passionate general of old. I also thought that both Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer did a good enough job. I was just a little hard to imagine them being parents to Farrell."

The white guys<br/><br/>emote. The dark guys grunt. They have no voice. Who cares about them<br/><br/>anyway, right? It's another example of American directors who believe that<br/><br/>""Epic"" means tossing a bunch of scenery- chewing Brits at the screen and<br/><br/>having them play other ethnic types. It's a 1950's movie ploy but done for the 21st Century. I half expected Liz Taylor and Richard Burton to do walk-ons. Americans and Brits should not be allowed to tan themselves up and play<br/><br/>people of color. It's insulting and dumb. Enough already. Surely the world is full of talented actors who can play their own ethnicity without having white guys take the parts. I mean, why DO the Greeks in this movie speak with Irish<br/><br/>accents anyway? It gets so ridiculous that Stone even has Val Kilmer, a Yank, donning an Irish accent. This is important because it purports to be a movie about the world and the man who conquered it and yet its vision is parochial. This is as much a cinematic error as it is a social one. It's just dopey film making.<br/><br/>Colin Farrel who knows how to scream and yell but not act, looks like Buster<br/><br/>Brown and his male lover looks like Fabio's younger brother.

I'm sick of watching historical epics where people feign the aforementioned accents when the original characters didn't even speak English in the first place. Besides, he wasn't the only Irish actor on set, hence the other Irish accents you hear in the film. Farrel has had to put on accents in most of his other films and he has done so quite well. Now he gets a chance to put all emphasis on the emotion and passion behind Alexander without having to reshoot because his American accent wasn't up to par.

","This movie received so much hoopla that everyone whoever watches this movie goes in with a pre-conceived notion and judgmental attitude. The movie is truly of epic proportions, production lacks in nothing, everything from sets to costumes has been given a lot of attention. Dialogues are well written, background score is excellent, acting couldn't be better, and the best part of the movie is its visualization of the war scenes, never before there has a been a scene to match the one in this movie. You are sure to get an adrenaline rush, while watching the war scenes. The movie is not a stereotypical Hollywood movie, it goes deep in the hero's psyche and tries to identify the reasons behind his great endeavors and things that made him and unique and superior to others. Common masses would certainly not understand this or appreciate this, thus the movie seems to be a failure amongst the common ones. The does not have typical biopic story line (i.e. based on the timeline) rather events occur according to the storytelling of Ptolemy, this tool is best used in case of sensitive issues in Alex's life, as they are shown as Ptolemy's views, especially in case of Alex's and his father's death. It certainly is a very well made movie, but became a media victim like so many of the reviewers here, if the movie was left alone, instead of entangling it in the webs of trivialities such as bisexuality, accuracy, Alexander's origins, accents of actors etc. Then it would have had better reviews, as matter of fact I would say had democrats won the election, then this movie would have been receiving much better reviews. Thus anyone who wants to have an excellent, accurate and honest visual experience of the life of one of the greatest man ever born then do watch this movie, but if you want to see how gay or straight it is, or how Greek or fictitious it is, or who speaks in what accent, then keep watching the CNN or any other American channel you will be satisfied indeed."

Bad script - woeful dialogue, and way too long, with two scenes in particular giving the impression they were never going to end; badly cast - Colin Farrel was completely out of his depth as the so called ""colossus"" described by Anthony Hopkins at the start of the film; directed in a completely self indulgent manner, with cliché riddled shots of flames and birds fanning out.<br/><br/>I knew I was in trouble from the opening scene where the special effects depicting the harbour in Alexandria were just laughable.

The only remotely interesting thing about this film was watching the audience leave at the points where Alexander's homosexuality became more and more obvious. Seriously people, if you didn't think he was gay when Alexander told his mom he didn't want to get married because he was in love with his friend, or when he was staring lustfully at the eunuch, you seriously needed to see him actually kiss a man before it finally clicked? Dear ZEUS! Just when you think the movie should be wrapping up, the film backs up 8 YEARS! It was an unending movie which I began to believe would only end when it had fully documented all 2300 years of human existence, beginning with the childhood of Alexander and ending with me entering the theater. Fortunately Alexander was poisoned, and I was allowed to go home. If that film had lasted even 5 minutes more I would have explored options of offing him myself.

","It's so difficult to convey the sense of the movie because while I loved the movie immensely, I know there was something off about it. I get the same feeling from watching Hero and Casshern, both excellent movies. <br/><br/>It sort of feels like if you have read Renault's fictional books on Alexander, then you'll have a greater understanding of what the movie was trying to get at. It is more about the nature of Alexander than his conquests or accomplishments-- in some ways, it's depressing and disappointing to see Alexander not portrayed with all his majesty and reputation, but then again, it's incredibly human to see a man who had accomplished so much be in so much misery. The average American audience will not like this movie because this is not a straightforward movie. It's not another Troy and it is not for the blockbuster audience. Much like Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49, it focuses on the aspect not visible, only hinted at. While people may think the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion was cheesy, it is actually a throwback to the Achilles/Patroclus relationship that confused scholars. <br/><br/>Is the exposition long? Yes, I think it is overly long. But Ptolemy's bitterness is very well conveyed by Hopkins, as well much of the cast. Farrell is surprisingly sentimental in this movie and pulls off an Alexander that people wouldn't be expecting-- a very ambitious and spirited man with a fragile psyche. The accents question is an example why average Americans won't understand-- if you bother to think about why there's so many accents, you need to reflect upon Ancient Greece where there was a myriad of accents, such as Macedonian highland/lowland, Thebes, Athens, and then moving onwards, the Greek mercenaries for the Persians, Persians, etc. The movie, if anything, is historically accurate to a fault, and anyone who denies obvious things like Alexander's ""bisexuality"" (as we call it now) is far too ignorant."

","After I finished watching Alexander, my first reaction was some disappointment. I had a huge expectation on the movie. I guess that, many audience, like me, wanna see another Benhur or Gladiator. But Oliver Stone totally shocked us by focusing a lot on his weird relationships with his parents, his male lovers and wife instead of his heroic deeds. Yes, if you expect this to be a mainstream epic movie, do not waste your time and money, because it will totally disappoint you in that way. But you cannot deny that it is a good but bizarre movie.<br/><br/>It is quite anti-traditional. I am bored with the perfect heroes in the previous movies with the same genre. They are tough, they have no shortcomings... All in all, they are not ordinary people or they could never have really existed. Oliver depicts Alexander not as a powerful conqueror, but as a tragic man trapped in a lot of struggles in his relationships. He is a strong conqueror in the day, but he is a little bit fragile and suspicious inside. Unfortunately Collin Farrel did not do a good job to convey the pain of Alexander from inside.<br/><br/>Let's forget the battles. If you want to the details of every battle in his life, I recommend that you should watch a documentary in history channel. The movie is not a diary of his life. The director picked his own understanding as an angle to describe him. If you happen to hate seeing homosexuality and weakness of Alexander, that's not director's fault but your own choice.<br/><br/>The movie also has several obvious drawbacks, such as very loose organization. The acting overall was not good. Angelina was especially exaggerated. There are many emotional scenes between collin and jared, but you just cannot feel their chemistry.

One thing stone has created with this movie, for the first time I have seen it is the sadness of war, what you loose, how men react during wartime. it was just awesome seeing how it all worked together. the actors are also doing a wonderful part in it.

","With Gladiator, Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan and The Last of the Mohicans being at the top of my favourites list of movies, it is safe to say that I am an avid follower of movies that is set against a historic background. With Alexander, I expected much of the same.<br/><br/>Knowing the history of Alexander and having seen the different trailers, I expected a feast of action and battles of epic proportions, not to mention a screenplay such as only Oliver Stone can dream up. What I got, however, was more of the latter and less of the former.<br/><br/>The point I'm trying to bring across is: not always getting what you expect, is often far more satisfying in the end.<br/><br/>Instead of focusing on Alexander's feats and achievements, we are instead shown WHY he he did what he did. What motivated him? Colin Farrell portrays Alexander as a human being who achieved feats worthy of the Gods his character tries to equal. He brings emotion and compassion to such an extraordinary human being, in being able to coldly issue order to kill some of his childhood friends, while also being able to instantly rally all of his men to follow him a few months longer.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie as his mother is spot-on as his cunning mother, although her accent is a little too over-the-top. And Anthony Hopkins, in perhaps the most difficult role in the movie as narrator, turns in an emotionally charged and awe-inspiring few minutes. <br/><br/>There is not one member of the cast that does not deliver what is required, but one that stands out is Val Kilmer in a binding performance.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent. To me the most beautiful scene in the entire movie is at Gaugamela in the dessert when, in the middle of the battle, Alexander spots Darius and mounts his horse to go after his father's enemy. Accompanied by Vangelis' powerful score, this scene gave me goosebumps. <br/><br/>""Alexander"" delivers a tour de force through the mind of an individual who was ahead of his time.

","I watched this movie 3 times once with the director Oliver Stones narration of the film the directors cut is great, a piece of History. they say that Greese was the birthplace of humanity and considering were we came from our nature has stood the test of time. This movie could have been made more decadent since that time in history was such a lustful place. I can understand the morality of the USA would find an uneasiness about this film but as viewed by the director that is the time it happened in. and that is what is was like. For historical fact this movie is a must have in any library. I think Oliver Stone is one of the very best in the industry and would rate anything from him a 10. I thought it was great but then I'm in touch with my titan side."
"johnwallen79","10","3","9","4 February 2005"," A Great Film on Alex
","It is very disappointing that such a marvelous film has been so poorly received in the States. At present Stone's 'Alexander' is doing rip-roaring business around Europe and the cynical comment to be heard in most theaters there is:'Americans don't understand history.' I think that is a shame...and yet perhaps it's nearer to the truth than most Americans would care to admit. Does it matter anymore to the fast food generation that Alexander really existed and took western civilization as far as to the Punjab in India? Does it matter that the places where he conquered were never to be the same again, retaining their western cast of mind through all the changes of successive centuries? Can Alexander's ferocious Macedonian brigades still speak down all the centuries to the flabby McD brigades of today, who take the car out of the garage in order to just go up the road? They can and westerners should listen.<br/><br/>Firstly, it should be said that this is a very historically accurate film, based as it is on the advice of Robin Lane Fox, the Alexander expert from Oxford, England, whose book on the Macedonian conqueror originally inspired Stone to make the movie. However, Stone doesn't just tell dry history. He makes a cinematic drama of Alexander's achievements, by interweaving obsessive tendencies in his character with successes and failures in his military and personal life. The narrative related by Alexander's old general, Ptolemy, now crowned Pharaoh of Egypt, is an imaginative touch which adds an extra dimension to the movie. The battle scenes are appropriately epic in scale and the surreal quality of Macedonians battling with spears against elephants in the tropical forests of the Western Punjab, give the audience a rough indication of just how far Alexander's army has traveled. Farrell submerges himself in his dynamic role and the idea of making all the Macedonians speak in an English dialect (Irish), is a highly dramatic touch, which emphasises the fact that the other Greeks thought of the Macedonians as being semi barbaric. Angelina Jolie's forced and guttural accent in her role as Queen Olimpias is a minor blemish on a wonderfully dramatic movie.<br/><br/>The fact that this magnificent film will not be winning any Oscars for its director and major players, is a comment on the current redundancy of the awards system itself."

This is by far the most boring, mind numbing drivel i have ever had the misfortune to watch. It wasn't funny, realistic, exciting it was just confusing and utterly dull. No character formation, the severe lack of any plot, constant skipping between time periods for no apparent reason. Wooden acting and the worst lead i've ever seen in my life. I would rather sit through a film like the cat from outer space than this because frankly it makes more sense.

","This movie needs a lot less Jolie and a lot more Jared. Stone leaves out a lot of Alexander's most interesting bits: his trips to Delphi and Ammon, his trips to Egypt, the death of Darius, the Gordian knot, his 13 day orgy with the Amazons (those one breasted hellcats who wanted to get pregnant by Alexander), the burning of Persepolis - instead he wastes time with Alexander's parents - both Jolie & Kilmer are way over the top. Jared Leto was wasted as Alexander's significant other Hyphestian- he gets less screen time than Alexander's horse Bocephalus - the other great love of his life. The battle scenes are grade A - although I think Darius also had elephants in his arsenal - not just the Indians. Colin is adequate but he's no Russell Crow.

","Stone's fever dream of the Ancient World. If there was ever a Cecil B. DeMille acid trip-fueled epic, it would look like this, and I mean that as a compliment (of course)! A symbolic stew of dust and blood, snakes and eagles, the sun and the moon, Angelina's eyes and Colin's hair, it's all knitted into the kaleidoscopic fabric of this audacious pageant. The depiction of the Battle of the Hydaspes is a psychedelic tour-de-force of majestic grit and gore in and of itself. A tale of messy passions and haunting myths. ""Fortune favors the bold"". Indeed.<br/><br/>(I'm an enthusiast, not a critic. Thanks for reading.)"

","Creative writing professors teach that stories should be told in chronological order. Past events make present events more meaningful. Withholding the past robs the audience of meaning; flashbacks inserted later fail to correct this but interrupt narrative flow. A jumbled order of events also makes it harder for an audience to follow what's happening. Again and again, writers flout this simple rule to the very great detriment of their work. This film is no exception. I cannot say that this film would be good if it were in chronological order, but at least it would be comprehensible.<br/><br/>In addition to jumbled chronology, this film boasts horrible direction from a top-notch director, sound effects and music that drown out important speech, poor editing, cringeworthy makeup, cringeworthy hair: dye and styling, and a cringeworthy, histrionic performance from the lead Colin Farrell. None of the acting is good here; not even Angelina Jolie showed to advantage despite being stunningly beautiful. (Incidentally, being approximately Farrell's age doesn't make Jolie miscast, because she's sometimes shown with Alexander as a young boy, and although some people seem to want more signs of aging when she is shown with Farrell, I couldn't bring myself to care about that.) But so many actors in this film were miscast, it's tempting to think that the casting directors were utterly inept, or people were cast on the basis of blackmail material. I will leave it up to others to determine whether the cast blackmailed the production for roles or whether producers blackmailed the cast into appearing in this travesty. I hate to think that these were the performances Oliver Stone wanted and used his clout as an industry giant to force from his cast.<br/><br/>The two battle scenes (that's right: only 2 in a 3.5 hour film about a man who spent his entire adult life conquering) were designed to show savagery in slow-motion close-ups, not to depict tactics, strategy, or outcome; they also used the overworked shaky-cam that is almost never a good idea (looking at you, Gladiator). It's difficult to tell who is being impaled, but the audience was never given any reason to care about any of them anyway. Such confusion might be realistic in depicting a common footsoldier's firsthand experience of battle, but it's not the way to tell the story of a military leader who was a tactical genius. The first battle shows Alexander's legendary strength and courage by having one of his men save Alexander from his own recklessness, making him look foolishly inept. The only other thing that these battle scenes convey is that war in ancient times was brutal. If that was news to you, go read some history before you watch any more movies. And if gore is all you want, horror flicks abound.<br/><br/>The melodramatic music did little but remind me of the emotions the film had not invoked. And no one in Hollywood has ever come close to Shakespeare's St. Crispin's Day speech, but that doesn't keep the hacks from trying. A scene of the war leaders debating tactics would have been much more effective at both informing the audience and building character.<br/><br/>For the people defending the accents: there are generic English accents – U.S. and British – that don't scream ""I'm from this particular region."" An RP English accent for Greeks and a generic U.S. accent for Macedonians wouldn't distract, so I could focus on what's being said. Farrell's accent makes it impossible to forget that he comes from Ireland. Say what you will, that accent rips me right out of a story about ancient Macedonians. Would you also defend a Texas twang or cockney?<br/><br/>People defending this film claim that its detractors only like mindless action flicks, don't appreciate history, or don't appreciate drama. I like action epics – if they're well made. I enjoy historical documentaries and history books – if they're good quality and informative. I like drama in both films and classic novels – if it's well done. This film fails at all these. It fails as an action flick because nothing happens except for two, brief, gory battles in which no one can tell who's winning. The film fails as history, because it depicts none of the important events of Alexander's life, except perhaps for his dysfunctional family dynamic which is told so out of sequence that no one can follow it anyway. And finally, the film fails as drama because it never gives a genuine sense of who any of these people were, let alone why anyone should care about them. This film neither educates nor entertains. Nor is it artistic; a few allusions, a symbolic eagle, and some acid-trip coloring isn't enough to make a movie artistic. The film succeeds at nothing except perhaps production design and costumes.<br/><br/>This film is more historically accurate than most historical movies, but then again, that isn't saying much. This film portrayed one of the greatest warriors, leaders, and military strategists of the ancient world as a neurotic, weirdly disingenuous, emo brat who is constantly blubbering and whining. Where is the young man whose quick wit and intelligence impressed Aristotle? Where is the young man whose courage, determination, and sound military strategy won the respect of all who fought with or against him? Where is the ambitious, ruthless young man who set out to conquer the world but was wise enough to recognize that actually ruling it required a different approach? As many reviewers have already stated, there is nothing in this film to explain why he is known as Alexander the Great.<br/><br/>I can mostly forgive Braveheart for its historical inaccuracy and even its character assassination of Scotland's national hero. But I can forgive Braveheart, because it's a good movie. Oliver Stone's Alexander is a hatchet job on the man it claims to portray, and it doesn't even manage to be decently entertaining.<br/><br/>It hurts to think of all the resources that were wasted on this."

","I'm weary of the torrent of criticism this movie has received from a number of different angles, some objected to the *homoerotic* scenes, some to the structure of the story-telling, some to the length of the movie, others to things as petty as accents or make-up.<br/><br/>It's unfair and unjustified on most counts, the movie as a whole and what is means is ignored in favour of the bandwagon. The critics slaughtered this movie and for reasons beyond my comprehension there are still people who let mainstream reviews influence how much they like a movie, before and after they have seen it.<br/><br/>This is an epic and it had to be, the scope and scale of Alexanders life and adventure is enormous. This isn't a man who's life story can be summed up in 90 minutes to please the kind of people who groaned at the first inkling that the two main characters Alexander and Hephaistion might actually care for one another, in any capacity whatsoever.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone IMO caught the scale of Alexanders adventure brilliantly, so vast was the potential content that it was inevitable that certain events had to be merged together and others omitted, the price for a watchable historical epic is that the director must include what is absolutely essential and leave the rest.<br/><br/>Stone also handled Alexander and Hephaistions relationship beautifully, Colin Farrell (Alexander) and Jared Leto (Hephaistion) work brilliantly together, conveying the love between friends and comrades, in ways that I feel much of the modern audience just can't comprehend. Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) sums it up perfectly early in the movie when discussing with a young Alexander the virtues of two men sharing knowledge and striving to bring out the best in one another.<br/><br/>That is what their relationship is about, not sex or lust as so many critics assumed and let influence them, in general I feel the whole movie was misunderstood.<br/><br/>If you watch the movie, give it a fair chance."

"kaiserellas","2","2","5","3 March 2006"," Oliver Stone & His Alexander is a Failure
","Oliver Stone's Alexander is a travesty of misinformation. Multiple historical errors compounded by critically omitted facts and understanding of the political and cultural climate of Ancient Greek culture and society...makes the depictions of Alexander as a person seem ridiculous in our present day world. Alexander the Movie by Oliver Stone depicts Alexander and his story out of context to the degree that the movie completely missed the point of Alexander's Greatness through his achievements and the essence of his mission.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's Homosexual Fantasy with Alexander the Great (A Fictional Account of Alexander with Oliver himself as Hephaestion and Bagoas) Is not only humorous and inaccurate but shameful for Stone to depict such lies. Bagaos the dancing boy in the movie for example in reality was a Persian Cavalry Commander that operated in Alexander's army in the drive towards India after the Persian defeats. There is no historical record of Bagoas the Commander and Alexander being lovers. Hephaestion depiction is so out of context it is ludicrous.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the 3rd major battle vs the Persians. The battle scene is fairly accurate...but why not show more of Alexander's military genius-he was a soldier first...prior to the movies opening battle Alexander: 1. Fought at the Granicus River with his 40,000 troops and routed a Persian army of 200,000 2. Fought at the Issus River and routed a second Persian Army of approximately 400,000 3. Besieged in one of the most brilliant shows of heroism and military engineering the cities of Tyre and Gaza before moving on to Egypt.<br/><br/>....where is any reference to those feats in Oliver's homosexual fantasy???<br/><br/>4. The movie opens at the fourth major battle where at Gaugamela Alexander routed an army of 1,000,000 men...but there is no build up to that, no suspense, no drama...none of the above is hardly mentioned in the movie...suddenly we are at Gaugamela and ho hum there is Alexander's army routing the Persians....and from there.<br/><br/>5. the movie spirals out of context to a few interpersonal issues with the men and a blatantly out of context bi-sexual orgy of sex and drinking on Alexander's part...the facts are so completely distorted and out of context that it is not even funny...however to anyone not familiar with the real history and character of Alexander one is left with this impression thanks to Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>6. The battle in India vs King Porus...wrong...Alexander was not injured in that battle...he took an arrow through a lung in a siege of a mountain city some 2 or 3 years prior to that battle-in which the display of his personal heroism in that siege can be a movie in itself-....another piece of misinformation.<br/><br/>For the record. In Antiquity prior to Christian ethics and due to the harshness of hand to hand combat in battles men became very close to each other as friends and comrades in arms...similar in today's terms as team sport athletes are close today...Men developed primarily platonic relationships that created bonds between them that within the political, social and cultural climate where acceptable relations with the intensity and severity of the need to be close brothers in arms due to the savagery of the periods warfare. These men were blood brothers, brothers in arms and their lives depended on one another in the field of combat even more so than soldiers of today, as a result the affection for ones friend(s) in antiquity under this social context was very sincere and intense. At a younger age of these developing friendships (most likely teenage years, since marriage and girls in antiquity were protected for marriage and it was unheard of for dating due to strict social codes where the girls must be married to have relations with their husbands) there were sparse and periodic experimentation that could border or cross over to the sexual...however this was a sort of right of passage of the time and was not a lifelong situation...as the boys became men they married and had normal relations with women/wives etc. If this is taken out of context of the period and transported to our period it seems like something it was not. Oliver Stone does not address this but shows us something out of context between Alexander and Hephaestion and out of a periodic time line as he does with Alexander and Bagoas and other references to the point where the whole movie becomes Alexander the Gay and completely misses the point of his mission. A more accurate analogy- 2000 years from now-there are no sports and a movie comes out about football players of today who are naked with each other in the locker room and somebody as a prank is spanking some players butt with his towel after a game...to make it worse the director makes inferences that the players have a thing between them....this is what Oliver Stone has done...ridiculous. The result being instead of the audience focusing and seeing what an intense game football was and admiring the feats of physical and mental heroism of players on the field en route to winning a championship...the audience focuses solely on ...wow those really big strong tough guys who played that sport where just a bunch of pansies with each other in those locker rooms huh? Who would have thought...this is the degree that Oliver Stone has misrepresented and shown us Alexander.<br/><br/>I will give credit to Collin Farell for playing the role to the best of his ability but he was stuck in Oliver Stone's fantasy.<br/><br/>Finally...the ridiculous acting of Mrs. Smith, Ms Brad Pitt or whatever you want to call Angelina Jolie was ludicrous...which is also a good way to summarize Oliver Stone and his movie.<br/><br/>Hopefully a true director will come along with depth and understanding of Alexander's true significance for the period and history and make a movie that is as powerful in it's mark as is Alexander's real legacy."

Gaugemela and the battle against Porus where the only battle scenes in the movie. The movie should contained those plus: Charonea, Granicus, Issus. Also the siege of Tyre which may have been Alexander's greatest accomplishment was missing. Also there was no mention of Barsine, and Staitra (The other women in his life.) Finally another very relevant detail was left out, the visit to Siwah where the priests told him he was the son of Zeus. That information drastically changed Alexander's life.

","As a student of classical studies at university, i have studied Alexander the Great and in contrast to the user comment by Sturdy ram anyone who has studied the topic in any detail knows that as well as skipping many of the more important aspects of Alexander's life it deviates from the truth on many occasions. The heavy fixation on the bisexual aspects of Alexander's personality are heavily over exploited and draw attention away from the great things rather then his sexual preference. Maybe he should have taken a leaf out of Homer's the Illiad's depiction of Achillies' homosexuality.<br/><br/>To the films credit there were strong acting performances from Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins who pretty much carry the film with strong emotive performances. Colin Farrell's Portrayal severely lacking but did in later stages of the film show glimmers of hope. The lack of any accents by the entire male cast was pathetic especially Rory Mcann as Crateros who's Scottish accent ruined a markable Performance.<br/><br/>If this film did win any Oscars for anything other then cinematography then the academy has truly lost its reputation.<br/><br/>This new fad of Classical ancient films (Troy) are truly lacking in all aspects of film making and without modern special effects wouldn't even make the box office, just proving that just because a movie costs several hundred million dollars to make doesn't make it worth watching and the only people i would recommend it to would be those who liked such brilliant historical films as Pearl Harbour and Troy."
"egmont_r","3","2","5","19 January 2005"," Interesting, but an artistic failure
","Mister Stone certainly took a risk by depicting Alexander, the great conquerer of the Persian Empire, as a bisexual general, loving both men and women equally, which was a wide-spread and accepted social behavior in Ancient Greek society. Although his romance with Hefaistion (as the Greeks would write it) is gigantically overemphasized, this should be applauded. However, we should be reluctant about this kind of 'Hineininterpretationen'. Oliver Stone certainly did a lot of historical research (and it shows) but social relations and love, especially between two men, had a totally different meaning and make-full than nowadays. This however, is not taken into account. As concerning the historical correctness, Stone did an effort to mix facts and fiction in an acceptable way. He failed. Some details are simply unacceptable. The battle of Gaugamela or Arbella for example was mainly fought by the Persian cavalry, and not by camels or entire hordes of light infantry. The famous oblique march of Alexander's infantry (though only shown in a single picture) and his personal attack on Darius are correct, as well as the huge dust clouds on the battle scene. Mister Stone is not very consequent in using this 'historical correctness'. The battle would have been much more agreeable to watch if the clouds of dust were not encumbering the view of the spectator and not obstructing the overview of the battle and thus showing Alexander's tactical genius. The battle scenes, as well as the 'bedscenes', two of the most difficult things to film, are not very succeeded. The personality of Alexander himself as shown in the film was a great disappointment too. Alexander the Great(a name given him by the Romans, not by Ptolemaios) was not the lover-boy or the manic-depressive (appologies if the term is incorrect) dreamer as presented in the film. Personnaly, I would not follow such a man to the end of the world. He was a general, first of all, who wasn't reluctant to destroy and plunder entire cities. He was an enormously charismatic man and inspired everyone that surrounded him. Sometimes I had the impression the man had to BE inspired all the time to carry on. He had a vision, and the film makes a good attempt to depict this vision, but does this by means of unnecessary long dialogs and scenes. Sometimes the film is simply boring and especially incoherent, omitting important episodes in his life and overemphasizing unimportant details. His last battle, in which he almost died, is cinematographically spoken ridiculous and overromantisized. And of the record, battles in ancient history of grand scale were never fought in jungles or forests. Altogether, this film is a psychological failure and cinematographically spoken worthless and amateuristic. The great genius of Alexander, the first western conquerer with the aim of submitting the entire world to his dominion and forge a brotherhood of man between the races and nations he conquered, deserves a better film. Sincerely, Egmont Ruelens"

"mercury4","1","2","5","11 December 2004"," Biggest waste of a movie I've seen yet
","I heard so many negative things about this movie. But I went and saw it anyway. I tried so hard to go into this movie with an open mind. I tried so hard to enjoy this movie, even though it was an Oliver Stone picture. Stone is a director I could care less for. I enjoyed Any Given Sunday, but after seeing Alexander I lost all respect for him. Many people, including Roger Ebert, have said Alexander the Not So Great. Believe me, that's putting it mildly. Not so great, is probably the biggest understatement I've heard about this movie. Why doesn't Oliver Stone just stay away from biopics? Okay, he stayed faithful to Ron Kovic's book for Born on the Fourth of July. But he made a mockery of Jim Morrison in The Doors. Jim Morrison is one of the most talented men of Rock. He wrote great music and had a great voice, but Oliver Stone managed to turn him into a drunken fool that took drugs every minute of his life.<br/><br/>Many people have complained about the image that Oliver Stone shows us of Alexander the Great. People say that Stone concentrated too much on gayness, but that is beside the point here. Either way the movie still sucks. I went to see this movie as soon as my local theater opened. Too my surprise I was the only person sitting in the theater. I had the whole theater to myself. I was excited, but by the time the movie was over my excitement had turned into disappointment. This movie is the biggest waste of a movie I've seen yet. The movie has a promising topic and it just goes to waste. With a man called Alexander the Great you would think he would get a better movie. Not only does Oliver Stone screw up showing us Alexander's life, he also screws up showing us his death. While Alexander is lying on his death bed it looks like he's on LSD.<br/><br/>Alexander just has nothing going for it. This movie has so many scenes of horrendous acting that it is impossible to take it seriously. In most scenes I found myself laughing. Every actor in this is just terrible. Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and especially Colin Farrell where on their coffee breaks when they made this. Out of all these actors Colin Farrell was the biggest disappointment. I expected so much from him after his performance in Phone Booth. Even the accents in this movie are horrible. Why does Colin Farrell talk with his Irish accent? Why do a lot of the other actors? What accent is Angelina talking with? Why is Rosario Dawson's accent so phony? These where some of the many questions going through my head. Alexander the Great has such an interesting story. The man conquered 90% of the known world. After seeing this movie you are left very unimpressed. If you are expecting a good biopic go look somewhere else. If you're expecting good battle scenes definitely don't look here. Okay, we all know Oliver Stone was in Vietnam. When is he going to stop trying to give us Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? The battle scenes in this movie are grotesque and disgusting. You get nauseous watching them not only from the camera being all over the place, but from the gore that doesn't let up. I was looking forward to the battle with the elephant army, but now I wish I never saw it. The whole scene was just animals getting butchered. If you can't stand the sight of animals being slaughtered stay away from this movie. I'm not exaggerating either. That's what the whole scene was. <br/><br/>There are rumors that Alexander was gay, but Oliver Stone, Mr. Controversy, doesn't stop mentioning it. After a while I found myself saying, ""All right already, we get the point."" I think that if it is only rumors it shouldn't be shown in a movie as being true. There are rumors that Errol Flynn was gay, but should they portray him as gay in a movie? People are always complaining about this one fault. Complain about more things. The whole movie sucks. From beginning to end the movie really sucked. Don't waste your time or money on this trash. Watch Gladiator, watch Spartacus, watch Ben-Hur, watch Alexander the Great with Richard Burton, and watch any Sword and Sandals movie you want, but stay away from this. This movie is so bad I rather sit and watch The Silver Chalice 100 times straight."

","This could pass by as the regular mildly entertaining glossy Hollywood production with an overdone score and grossly melodramatic acting, but unfortunately it doesn't even make that mark. I can't believe Oliver Stone directed this...not that I think he's a great filmmaker, but it seems with his experience he'd know how to write and direct a semi-decent script. In this film, however, he shows absolutely no sense for dramatic build. The film is so poorly structured that any opportunities the story gives to grasp the audience are completely destroyed. There is no suspense, no way to connect with the characters, no intrigue, no excitement...and this is ridiculous, considering Alexander the Great's life gives plenty to work with. What should be the most interesting parts of battle scenes are omitted, the action sequences are poorly timed and poorly placed. The inconsequential and<br/><br/>unnecessary flashback in the last half of the film is a perfect example of how terribly the film is structured. The acting could have been acceptable if the directing had been any good, but it's not. Consequently the characters are pitiful, and inspire in the audience none of the feelings they so exaggeratedly demonstrate on screen. Alexander is the most boring character of all. And this torturous nightmare lasts over two hours! I weep at the money that was wasted on this project."
"algenicus002","1","2","5","7 December 2004"," Boring, boring, boring - oh, and inaccurate, too.
","I had the rather unfortunate idea of watching this movie last night. Of course, knowing the absolute monstrosity that ""Troy"" was, I did not expect to see something even remotely faithful to the events as given to us by reliable historical sources such as Plutarch, but rather a noisy Hollywood fanfare for the common man... Or at least what the American showbiz thinks the common man is.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" proved to be even less than that. I received the first shock when I saw Antony Hopkins as the narrator. Common sense says that the first step you can take to ruin your movie is to use a narrator. The second step is to overuse the narrator (as Carl Macek did in the horrendous ""Robotech"") and start shredding the audience's nerves. However, old Ptolemy was not the movie's worst part. In fact, he seemed to be its only redeeming factor!<br/><br/>Why am I saying this? First of all, the scenario was weaker than a dried-up twig, distorting Alexander's formative years, then omitting another formative period (which included, among other significant events, his entrance to Egypt, where his apotheosis took place; oh, I forgot: Egypt prohibited the producers to film there after reading the script). And the rest was one endless sequence of decadent oriental parties with tons of homosexual innuendoes, in a blatant marketing attempt to caress the ears of the gay community. Oh yes, and two badly-directed battle scenes... So much for the super-duper-production.<br/><br/>The only actor who stood up to the value of his profession and to his name was, predictably, Mr. Hopkins. The rest never rose above the murky waters of the trite dialogues, which only had two modes: either an incessant, drunken yelling or a hush-hush talk between the two ""lovebirds"", as the scriptwriter so stupidly presented Alexander and Hephaistion (although it is twice mentioned by Plutarch that Alexander despised homosexuality... But who cares about history when marketing needs the gay community?). This quickly tired the audience and destroyed all of Stone's hopes to achieve the so desired by directors suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Mrs. Jolie's screams could serve well, had she been a guest in Jerry Springer's show. Pity that physical beauty is not enough. Colin Farrell simply does not have the talent to play such a multi-faceted character as Alexander. Val Kilmer's Philip was, well, convincing for what Kyle and Kalogridis wasted precious ink and paper-producing trees to ""create"".<br/><br/>As for the props and scenery, they were outrageous. First of all, even old Italian low-budget mythology-inspired films had more elegance than this horrid, putrid mess that looked too much like an elementary school theatrical show. And why was it that, in the panoramic views of Babylon, the viewer could easily see modern cities in the background? Not to mention the usage of Greek and Greek-looking alphabet to write English texts on the scrolls! Obviously someone is desperately lacking in inspiration, I see...<br/><br/>Don't waste your money, people."
"FilmSnobby","1","2","5","2 December 2004"," With apologies to Brad Pitt.
","My Summary refers to my rather unkind comments about Mr. Pitt in reference to the Other Greek Epic That Came Out This Year, *Troy*. Not only was *Troy* significantly better than *Alexander*, but Brad Pitt suddenly seems credible as Achilles when compared to Colin Farrell as the Macedonian empire-builder. And in the Old-Codger-From-The-U.K. category, Peter O'Toole at least brought moments of humanity to *Troy* . . . Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy of Egypt (one of Alexander's generals), on the other hand, is stuck with doddering around a bad set with a matte behind it, and otherwise narrating events that might've proved worthy of an actual presentation by the director.<br/><br/>But Oliver Stone is not interested in narrative; he seems to be making some sort of half-baked critique about George W. Bush via historical allegory. He fails. If I want critiques of Bush, I'll turn to Michael Moore. If Oliver Stone really wanted to tell a story about an idealistic idiot who thought he could re-fashion the Orient in his own Hellenized (i.e., Western) image, why not simply offer up Yet Another Documentary About Bush?<br/><br/>This would've at least served a practical purpose. Instead, Stone holds his nose and tries to sneak his allegory in under the lead weight of the Hollywood Blockbuster, an institution that simply will not brook iconoclasts who don't know how to be subtle.<br/><br/>Setting aside the folly of Stone's aims in *Alexander*, the movie itself is poorly made to a really shocking degree (or perhaps NOT so shocking a degree, when one recalls *Natural Born Killers*, *U-Turn*, and other choice bits from Stone's oeuvre). Stone has apparently forgotten how to stage even the simplest scene: the actors are poorly blocked; there's far too much cutting back and forth between close-ups, resulting in spatial confusion (meaning, we get no realistic sense of setting during an individual scene). The narrative arc is out-of-whack: two-thirds of the way through, we suddenly flashback eight years earlier, apropos of nothing. (I've heard arguments defending this particular misstep, but they're unconvincing.) The voice-over narration is, of course, a dead giveaway of storytelling desperation. And the acting! Poor Oliver Stone, forced to deal with the likes of Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie. Because I always feel a little shameful when speaking poorly of actors -- whose trade is a difficult one -- I'll keep my remarks about their efforts focused strictly on their accents. Farrell sounds like a Belfast tough; Jolie sounds like Anna Magnani with a hangover.<br/><br/>Excitable heteros, *Matrix*-nerds, and other assorted teenage males seeking action in *Alexander* will be positively freaked out by all the chit-chat and Big Speeches, to say nothing of the overt bisexual swing to the movie. (Where's dour, safely sexless Russell Crowe when you need him?) But even the latter element, which presumably should've stoked this ""controversial"" director's interest, is hilariously G-rated. I would be amused to hear a gay reviewer's opinion of all the scenes involving Colin Farrell and Jared Leto (as Alexander's lover Hephaestion) hugging each other and staring dreamily into each other's eyes while they talk about Democracy, Freedom, and whatnot. This movie will furnish capital for gay satire for years to come, I suspect. Alexander the Fabulous! And his Boyfriend! Stone wasn't exactly Keeping it Real, here.<br/><br/>Those seeking intelligence, rather than the typical pumped-up action of a Hollywood historical epic, will also be disappointed. All the Big Speeches I referred to earlier aren't really about anything. Stone confuses volume with content: most of the dialog involves Angelina Jolie taunting her son into becoming king. (""Yes, Mother,"" replies Norman Bates.) And once he IS King, she sends him taunting letters filled with Jewish-Mother advice. The Oedipal stuff is routine and not in the least disturbing, though perhaps this is because Ms. Jolie is only about one year older than Mr. Farrell in real life. As for Alexander's military campaigns, Stone is interested only in the Iraq (i.e., Babylon) portions of them -- that way, you see, he can make his stupid political point. And I suspect that the India campaign is in here only because Bollywood is trendy at the moment.<br/><br/>I've gone on long enough about this crap. 1 star of 10, obviously. Only God knows what Baz Luhrmann has in store for us with HIS treatment of Alexander the Great: *Alexander: Dance! Dance! Dance!*, or something."

","I wouldn't even recommend seeing this movie at a dollar cinema because it isn't worth three hours of your time. Stone doesn't develop the story well enough. He overemphasizes Alexander's bisexuality - rather than just mentioning it (it was common among Greek men of the time) he portrays it as central to the man's life, showing it to us over and over. But more than that, the story is not well developed. By the way, how can so many important things be omitted when the movie is three hours long? Alexander's consolidation of power in Greece before setting out for Asia is completely absent. The early stages of his travels to Asia, including the battle at Grannicus, is left out. The last hour just plodded along pointlessly. Please learn from my mistake and save yourself. This movie is definitely a must-miss. Watch something about Alexander on the History Channel or read a book about him instead."

","This movie has to rank as one of the worst ever made by Oliver Stone. Instead of concentrating on the brilliant military strategy and leadership qualities that Alexander the Great had to have possessed...the filmmaker concentrated on putting an emphasis on Alexander's homosexuality. The homosexuality factor was driven home so repeatedly throughout the film that it became obnoxiously blatant. What could have been a great film was cheapened by the lack of time spent on the historically important aspects of Alexander's life and conquests. The only people that will find this film entertaining or enjoyable will be the gay male culture who will be able to relate to the homosexuality displayed so blatantly.

There's only two actual battles in the movie -- and while they are quite possibly some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, they can't redeem this absolute travesty of a movie.<br/><br/>The movie's rife with historical errors. There was never really any big dissent or conspiracy among his men. Alexander wasn't poisoned either, he fell in battle -- at least, that's how it has always been recorded. The only thing the movie really got right was the path Alexander took through Asia.<br/><br/>The movie is ludicrously long. It's not like LOTR, where the story and acting are just so wonderful that you don't even notice how long it is -- with this movie, practically everyone in the theater was looking at their watches, like, every ten minutes. And the plot takes so long to get moving that it never really moves. It'll inch along, and then just stop for like 30 minutes straight. The movie wasn't compelling and you felt nothing when any of the characters died.<br/><br/>Then there is the homosexuality issue. There is just blatant homosexuality in this film. I don't know if Oliver Stone was trying to make a message to the g@y community or what. Now, I know that men could be a lot closer to each other back then and it was considered kosher (Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, although Achilles supposedly had women as well) but this movie is full of men just randomly making out. It's totally out of place.<br/><br/>That's about all I've got to say.

Alexander's dreams and his determination never to give up on them. His dear commitment to Hephaistion (I think it's unfair to minify the movie only as some can't stand the true historic perception of love between men in ancient Greece), his relation to Bucephalos, and his bold ambitions to reach the end of the world, all of that appeals to me. Whenever I look into Colin's eyes, I see the boy who wanted to find the land where Heracles traveled to. I see the boy who tamed the black stallion and who rode towards the sun. I see the boy who talked to Aristotle about ruling the world. I see the boy who holds his father's hand, staring at the cave paintings, shivering in veneration. So... I see Connor Paolo all the time. That's what makes this movie so special to me. I see the overall character of Alexander in his eyes, which makes me feel I know him. The courage to fight for his dreams, the ambition never to give up, the endurance to take a stand and conquer. Alexander is a masterpiece of tremendous importance, at least in my eyes. The ancient leader is portrayed decently and true to history, with all his failures and flaws, but with such power and credibility that make my eyes wet whenever he approaches the war elephants and whispers into Bucephalos' ears ""You and I again, for the last time."" I see young Alexander again, when he saved the stallion's life. Life is a circle, and every circle closes itself one day. Connor Paolo is outstanding, really. I'm a fan of him since this movie.

However, if you look at it with a historical point of view, it truly is a masterpiece. Not because it's historically accurate, such a film is simply impossible, but because it gives a perfect mixture and reflection of many scientific theories around the historical Alexander. Almost nothing is known about Alexander. The first written information about this miraculous figure dates back from three hundred years after his death. Stone isn't merely trying to entertain us, he informs us , mixes the most prolific and believable theories around the historical Alexander with fiction and place the information that's given in the process in the right perspective, sometimes even downplays it. The result is an overdose on information without the conventional storyline and the conventional characters, that is not relaxing to watch for everyone among us, I understand. I experienced the same thing after seeing it twice. A film like the green mile is easier on the mind and evokes more tears, and makes you want to identify with the characters. I think 'the green mile' is great, Alexander however deserves to be judged on a different level. Just see it with a historical perspective.

","Oliver Stone has created an extraordinary movie with his film Alexander. Taken from the works of dozen of writers, his epic is the finest composite of the mythic hero as could be fashioned.

Still the result is incredible. The selection of Colin Farrell, Connor Paolo and Jessie Kamm, as Alexander prove inspirational. A host of notables, such as Anthony Hopkins, Brian Blessed, Christopher Plummer and Val Kilmer proliferate the historical sage with Angelina Jolie and Francisco Bosch whose handsome features adds legendary beauty to the masterpiece. Opting not to incur the wrath of Christian Hollywood, Stone allows ancient Hellenic boys who wrestled in the nude to wear loin cloths in the Greek gym and plays down the homosexual angle between Alexander and Hephaiston, for the romantic adore and a single kiss with the Persian Boy, Bagoas. A scene which got the film banned, in of all places, Greece.

The only thing I found a bit distracting was the prevalence of Irish accents which sort of represented most of the ""Greek"" cast and the slight cardboard quality of the characters worked for me as knowing what military commanders and or officers are like it made sense. The openly bisexual with nature of Alexander's sexuality is believable especially if you understand the morality of the day. However the relationship with Hephaestion is a more than the pederasty of the times. have a look at www.wikipedia.org they have some really nice and accessible pieces on Alexander and his sexuality as this seems to be the only thing in the movie people focus on.<br/><br/>So lets get crude: A national GAY** hero Ruled the known world and had conquered all the major civilizations of the time, gave them in many instances all the trappings of civilization even to extent of influencing their religion. Lets just look at the countries and this is not complete: Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Irak, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern parts of India. He influenced Buddhism to the extent where Buddha is depicted in Grecian dress. He was hailed as the son of Zeus or thus the major god of the Greek pantheon and as such 300 years before Christ a son of a king, also claimed to be a son of a god and ruled the world. Achilles another hero we saw in troy (where the director did not have the guts) was definitely gay too (yes Brad Pit should have had a romantic interlude with a guy). Patroclus was not his ""cousin"" as stated in the movie but his lover. Alexander and Hephaestion even sacrificed together at the shrines for Achilles and Patroclus at Troy. This once again re affirms the nature of their relationship.<br/><br/>Lets not claim the hero's as solely gay but lets acknowledge that sexual taboo's were not as evident in those days and that sexuality did not condemn one or promote one but was secondary to skill, ability and ambition. Unlike today's society where discrimination is rife and at least 6-10% of the world's population live in fear of their sexual identity being known. Live in fear in areas which Alexander used to rule of being beheaded, stoned or worse (tortured in the most horrible fashion).<br/><br/>Imagine being 25 again. Imagine having led an army of around 40,000 people against an army of around 300 000 and won. Imagine you are one of the most brilliant military commanders and visionaries of your time and can see a united world (we are still trying this 2000 years later and he almost succeeded). Imagine you have experienced all the known cultures of your world.<br/><br/>Now imagine being killed or maimed before you could achieve that. Know that the legacy we have today and the one Alexander left behind differs. And WE have a lot to learn. He was one of the most brilliant heroes of the old world. But by far not the only gay/bisexual man of substance.

"Danusha_Goska","Null","3","11","4 December 2004"," Good Performances; Spectacular FX; Lousy Script
","Super special effects. Fine, fun, sword-'n-sandal-worthy performances.<br/><br/>If only someone besides Oliver Stone had written the script ...<br/><br/>I can't imagine what a world conqueror would look like, but Colin Farrell compels; he shows the necessary charisma, sex appeal, male bonding, arrogance, blood lust, in turns. In the scenes where he isn't very good, it's the script that fails him, rather than visa versa.<br/><br/>Farrell doesn't convey Alexander's vision, but the script never made clear what its Alexander's vision was, exactly. A fatal flaw in a script whose main narrative drive has got to come from a tedious slog from Macedonia through Persia to India in the days before hotels had hot or even cold running water. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie, as Alexander's mother, gives a high camp performance that will live in film fandom for a long time to come, at least as long as Anne Baxter saying, ""Moses, you splendid, adorable fool!"" in ""The Ten Commandments."" <br/><br/>Jolie was an epic femme fatale. She could have eaten any number of film noir femme fatales for breakfast. Some critic said she gave a ""nostril flaring"" performance. Not true. I didn't catch one nostril flare. She really didn't have to flare her nostrils. Jolie fully inhabited this snake-wearing force of nature. <br/><br/>The Persian Boy is exactly what I would expect a Persian Eunuch love slave to look like.<br/><br/>The special-effects Ancient Babylon was spectacular. I would rewatch the movie just to see it again. <br/><br/>Rosario Dawson, as Alexander's wife, well...one can say one thing for sure. Dawson has amazingly large breasts. Bigger than her head. She swings them around. Not from a censorship point-of-view, but from an anatomical/aesthetic point-of-view, I was queasy. Can Dawson act? Does she need to? Not till they start to sag, and that could be any day now, unless she gets a carefully engineered brassiere. <br/><br/>The Battle of Gaugamela, an historic event at which Alexander defeated Darius, gave me everything I bought my ticket for. I felt as if I had a sweeping view of an important historic event from the ancient past -- and that's what I wanted to see. <br/><br/>I believed the acres of flat, yellow sand, the scythe-equipped Persian chariots that rendered the Greek troops mincemeat; I believed heavily-mascaraed Darius, standing and watching in his chariot; I believed Farrell, exhorting his troops, his eyes crazed with blood lust; I believed Farrell, gently helping one of his foot soldiers ""let go of his body."" I enjoyed the avatar of Zeus, an eagle, watching over everything as it swooped, repeatedly, over the plains. <br/><br/>During the better scenes, I was primed to expect something as good as ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The ingredients are all there. Flawed, world-whipping hero, gay sex, sand, vast vistas, costumes. The ironies of an empire that wants to ""liberate"" the eastern, barbarian peoples it kills and enslaves.<br/><br/>But the script really sucked. It just sucked. I don't know what else to say except to say that it sucked.<br/><br/>No narrative arch. No intelligence. No attempt to address the obvious ironies of a man loved by his men, whose very same comrades murder his wife and his child after he dies; a man who wants to ""liberate"" people while murdering and conquering them.<br/><br/>Heck, the old black and white classic, ""Conquest,"" with Greta Garbo as Marie Walewska and Charles Boyer as Napoleon does a better job of addressing that same irony.<br/><br/>Was Alexander a monster or a superhuman? I can't say the script dropped that ball, cause the script never even picked it up. <br/><br/>Oh, what this movie could have been, with a better script.<br/><br/>Sigh. <br/><br/>I hope Colin Farrell wins from this. He was as good as Errol Flynn at his best. I went in with low expectations, cause he left me totally cold in ""Minority Report."" He won me over here in his very first scene."

And Stone does great justice to the topic. The plot is subtle and intriguing. The visuals are enchanting; the battle scenes are epic and ferocious. The passionate love story between Alexander and Hephaistion - played wonderfully by Jared Leto - was humane and romantic (oh, and homophobes will be quite alarmed by the dignity and acceptance afforded same-sex relationships in this film). The cast worked surprisingly well together.<br/><br/>Sure, there are times when the film becomes a little pretentious - it is an Oliver Stone film, after all.

"tabuno","9","1","2","24 January 2019"," An Epic Historical Classic
","25 November 2004. It was with great reluctance that I proceeded to go to Alexander. But this Oliver Stone masterpiece is controversial (in content for many) but unlike Troy, it does not avoid the raw, complex, and rich personal historical, mythic tale of an important historic figure. This fascinating, convoluted movie is rich in both its depth of each character each full of conflict, inconsistency, and powerful vision. Like real life, this full scale, epic picture has a battle scene that is much more vast than any of Troy scenes. Angelina Jolie has a great role and Colin Farrell performs in a role that has raw and intriguing complexity. The gay component of Greek life is not hidden, the illicit relationships, the inside bickering are all on display here as in a Greek tragedy that befits such an operatic classic. Easily the best historical drama this year, Alexander is a movie that can compare with the best of them - even Ben Hur for its bravery, its majesty, itsthe movie Troy may be forgotten, Alexander as in the movie itself, his myth and legend will live on - just as if Alexander himself and his life enabled this movie to be a great testament to his life and to raise the movie itself to the great heights of cinematographic, directorial, and performance excellence easily accorded to this movie. Well deserving of many film awards, if not for its political incorrectness on many fronts both ethnic (Greek and otherwise, gayness, and violent brutality). Nine out of Ten Stars."

","I saw no cohesiveness. This movie bounced about with the accuracy or direction of a child's game of ping-pong. All over the place. Seemed to place way too much emphasis on sexuality. And if Alexander was a brooding brat, then this movie is accurate. I don't think so..."
"humberstones5","9","1","2","15 July 2018"," A bold and beautiful epic
","For anyone interested in Alexander and perhaps having some background of his significance, of events, of places in his time then this is a compelling film. It would appear Stone has kept it faithful to the factual accounts as far as possible and captures the brilliance, generalship and greatness of Alexander whilst at the same time exploring the root of his inspiration and ambition from childhood. Farrell is flawless. The accents seem to raise a comment from some reviewers as off putting but the directors commentary explains this as intentional to infer the multi-cultural and celtic traces of the Macedonians. Alexander's close companions througout both his youth and his campaigns revolve around Alexander and this is perhaps shown to better effect in the Directors Cut. The difference in the two versions amounts to the original theatrical version as being more of a linear storyline (from child in Macedon, adolesecent in Greece and General and King in Persia (although split over 2discs is an annoying intermission), whereas the Directors Cut is told via flashbacks,(and less a few scenes, mostly of the love between Alexander and Hephastion) so engaging the viewer in two timelines). There are few films that can be watched 3times in a week, but we found this to be one of them. Vangelis provides a powerful and dramatic soundtrack (fans of Ridley Scotts 1492:Conquest of Paradise should enjoy) and there is a similar scale of epic here.
I've given this a top rating because it was all I'd expect of a film and more and if you are familiar with at least the background and some characters, the history behind the Persian-Greek wars, and the impact on Greece, Asia, India etc then you shouldn't be disappointed. Alexander's dream was beyond the comprehension and desire of most men, his ambition almost that of a God, all of this capably shown in the film, and for the man who modelled himself on Achilles, his own weakness comes through in the form of his lifelong friend Hephastion (his Patrocles), and Farell, Jolie, Kilmer play their parts, not themselves. 
It was a vast undertaking to attempt to convey such a man, but then, Fortune Favours the Bold!"

","Alexander is an epic film based on the life of Alexander the Great. It was directed by Oliver Stone, with Colin Farrell in the title role together with Angelina Jolie,Val Kilmer,Jared Leto,Rosario Dawson and Anthony Hopkins. The film was an original screenplay based in part on the book Alexander the Great, written by historian Robin Lane Fox.<br/><br/>The film is based on the life of Alexander the Great, King of Macedon, who conquered Asia Minor, Egypt, Persia and part of Ancient India. Shown are some of the key moments of Alexander's youth, his invasion of the mighty Persian Empire and his death. It also outlines his early life, including his difficult relationship with his father Philip II of Macedon, his strained feeling towards his mother Olympias, the unification of the Greek city-states and the two Greek Kingdoms - Macedon and Epirus - under the Hellenic League,and the conquest of the Persian Empire in 331 BC. It also details his plans to reform his empire and the attempts he made to reach the end of the then known world.<br/><br/>The movie gives us some truly stirring visuals and music that soars but performances that not so believable and credible.At a reported cost of $155 million, it qualifies as a super-spectacle in every respect except for Colin Farrell is woefully miscast in the lead.We barely get any substance on who Alexander is all about.Also,the film is a disaster on an epic scale for it is sprawling, messy and incoherent.In the end,it simply never lived up to its potential."

","Thanks to those writers with political agendas for ruining a good story. It seems some can not understand the drive and focus it takes to be a great leader. Pushing their political beliefs onto a historical person were there is no historical evidence of having a male concubine is pretty pathetic. I would not consider this as an accurate portrayal of the real historical person known as Alexander the Great. The bouncing time line leads to a little confusion too. If you are not somewhat familiar with the historical time line of the man's life, you might get a little lost during this 3 and a half hour film. The 1956 version, though not a great movie in itself, is a much better telling of the story of Alexander."

Being one of those ""stupid"" people or ""stupid American"" i didn't like this movie for the lack of combat and the showing of his great reign as King!!! The showed plenty of personal life of him and a lot of him being sick , and enough how his soldiers suffered on long journeys,enough of graphic shots but where was the the great battle fights and awesome reign..... you could have added all the other stuff and still had room for the 2 main things that were pretty much left out. I seriously almost walked out half way through the movie theater.(which would be the only movie i would have) Sorry but like one person said already, how can you have so many great actor/actresses names and such a bad film. It was awkwardly boring and painfully too long for me to be interested in anything that was going on. I wouldn't call the ""American critics"" stupid on this one... your just missing the big picture that we are seeing that makes Alexander ----- well great.

Angelina Jolie is always a pleasure to behold but perhaps a bit too hot for a mommy.<br/><br/>2. I don't remember a harp playing through the entire film. What I remember is an amazing, powerfully sweeping score by the master Vangelis.<br/><br/>3. Shows Alexander as the troubled, egotistical but brilliant and beloved warrior, commander and king of the Macedonians.<br/><br/>4. Possibly the most epic filmed battle scene in cinema history - the Battle of Galgamela. True to historical accuracy from the mighty phalanx formations down to the lowliest peltast and his sling.<br/><br/>5. Clever use of the Irish accent in contrast to the many films we are used to that always portray Greeks and Romans with proper British accents. Kind of shows the Macedonians as distant clannish ""cousins"" of the Greeks in this manner. Whoever criticized this point must have something against the freaking Irish.<br/><br/>6. The point was well made and also contemporary and topical at a time not long after the events of 9/11. It was about Alexander's dream and attempt to reconcile the peoples of the East and West.<br/><br/>7. Alexander was one of, if not THE most brilliant field commanders in history. This we know. He was also a visionary so we did not NEED to have the entire 3 hours devoted to battle and slaughter. (See Point #4 - good enough for me)<br/><br/>8. The most stupid and ridiculous criticism of a long list of stupid criticisms - not even going to bother with this one.<br/><br/>9. Ditto to the rest...<br/><br/>I'll just end by saying, Oliver Stone does not make pointless horrible movies. The only thing that made me cringe in this movie was Jared Leto whispering sweet nothings into Collin Farrel's ear... this was a brilliant movie and one of my most favorite by Oliver Stone. I'm just glad there's as much controversy about the quality of this film as there was about Alexander's life.<br/><br/>To the person who wrote the original ""10 Step"" critique - if you can't understand films like this, maybe you should stick to films like Animal House or Transformers."

I had expected more scenes like the execution of Bessus, who betrayed Darius. For regicide, Alexander, in history, had him pulled apart by bent back trees. I really would have like to have seen that. I would have like to have seen the siege of Tyre, also. Instead, we get more sodomy! I would have like to have seen the crushing of the Greek rebellion, early in his reign. Instead, sodomy.

"esteban1747","8","1","2","28 October 2008"," Very much like Alexander the Great
","It would be interesting to ask Oliver Stone whether the idea of making this film was inspired by the documentaries he made about Fidel (Alejandro) Castro. Personally I think that he was looking for some similarities between both and tried to establish a parallel or may be this is just a coincidence. The history of Alexander I was taught at high school was very close to the story of this film. It greatly differs from the former ""Alexander the Great"" (1956) directed by Robert Rossen. Obviously, in the 50s there were so many prejudices in the society to show not a real Macho Alexander, but the fact is that this film showed the egocentric character of the Macedonian monarch, he was thirsty of conquers, he wanted his name to be remembered for ever, he wanted to be the Great, he did not care about family, that was not part of his dreams, he wanted to reign now and forever. The nature of Alexander was well reflected by Stone.<br/><br/>However, personally I think that the selection of the cast was not the best. Angelina Jolie is quite young to play the role of Olympias, the Alexander's mother. The real age difference between Angelina and Colin Farrell (Alexander) is just one year. Probably they both can star well in a romantic film instead of playing mother and son in this film. Farrell was not either a good choice as Alexander, he did not show that strong character I assume the Macedonian had. Good performance from the old Ptolemy played by Anthony Hopkins and an acceptable Filippo (Val Kilmer)."

This movie is historically accurate unlike most films. As a history buff, I am happy with this aspect. The acting is good, but some scenes are a bit cheesy. The screenplay could've been better. Some parts of the film is just talking, talking, and more talking. The one thing that bothers me the most is the male kissing. I could not stand those scenes.

"joeythemachine","8","1","2","3 October 2007"," Absolutely Underrated
","One of Oliver Stone's best films. For me, Oliver Stone's quality of work throughout his career varies immensely, but then how many have achieved his eclecticism, and control. After reading the complaints people have had with this film, it really seems as if the film is overshadowed by expectations and, of course, stomach-aches over homosexuality. The film isn't about Alexander's battles (the theatrical release, I'm talking about here, not the faux ""Director's Cut""), it's about him; his life. An idea of what a real human being might be like if we are to interpret historical accounts of him with reason rather than wonder. It's not supposed to be Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, or Ridley Scott's Gladiator. It's not about Greece, or patriotism, or duty, or honor. It's not a myth. Instead it's a more realistic perspective of a man set against the myth. And even further proof of the film's effectiveness is the polarization of it's viewer's opinions.<br/><br/>As far as film-making goes, you make you're own decision. I thought the hours breezed by. A quality edit and every moment is packed. The shots are rich, diverse, and each location is uniquely styled while still retaining consistency befitting the film's general style. When you are brought into different times, you can see it; it's there. When there's a battle, the audiences sense is comparable to the leader. When Alexander has a sense of what's where, you see it and hear it. When chaos and singularity ensues, you're gripped by shots that the show the instinct and emotion of one man, Alexander, trying to survive. But that's this film. Maybe you'd rather not have that experience, that's fine too, but I really get the feeling that what the filmmakers set out to accomplish, was."

I was glad to find out that that aspect of his life was not cut out, as the people who made ""Troy"" refused to acknowledge Achilles' homosexuality. Some moments are over-the-top, especially in the father-son relationship between Kilmer and Farrell, but the battle scenes are much better than anything in ""Troy"" or ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and it is awfully fun to listen to the accents done by Jolie and Rosario Dawson (who gets the delicious line, ""*You* love *heem*?!"") As Peter O'Toole said in ""My Favorite Year"" (1982), ""Bravo, Stone, bravo."""
"raymond-15","7","1","2","11 February 2007"," Admirable attempt at capturing a turning point in history
","After a lot of unnecessary disparaging remarks about the portrayal of a bisexual hero which I quickly discarded, I was able to concentrate on some of the outstanding qualities of this epic tale.<br/><br/>Firstly I admired the sweeping vistas of the lands that Alexander (Colin Farrell) conquered and enslaved. All credit to the set designers and the magic wrought by computerization. There was so much to watch in these crowd scenes.so many soldiers.so much action.<br/><br/>Secondly there were the costumes for men and women, warriors and soldiers, rich and poor and royal families of different lands. So much research was required here. After all 356 BC was a long time ago. If you are going for authenticity, you must not let the imagination roam too far. I thought the overall effect of the costume design was fantastic. Congratulations to those responsible. You did your job well.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the battle scenes were understandably chaotic. How else could you record hand to hand fighting? There were some graphic shots I will always remember. I am not sure why but the forest of spears in vertical position prior to the attack was a wonderful piece of cinema that sent shivers down my back. Also the elephants in India lunging forward through the tropical undergrowth like an unstoppable army was an inspiring sight.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone as the creator of this mammoth project must have dreamed for many years about the portrayal of Alexander. I imagine that he had many sleepless nights. The result which hit the movie screens around the world is a digest of Alexander's unique life. It shows us that Alexander was so much more than a soldier. He was also a man who had his fears too...was prone to explode in a violent temper... and again break down and cry when things went bad.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell in the title role had a gigantic task ( and did well) as the teenager who led an army (Can you imagine such an event today?) and went on to conquer the kingdoms of North Africa, Asia Minor and Persia. He made a striking figure on his favorite horse as he urged his men ever onward when all they really wanted was to go home to their wives and children. His eventual death at 33 still remains a mystery but wine spiked with arsenic is a likely cause. Alexander's mother with whom he quarreled frequently insisted he was the son of Zeus. While many mothers adore their sons even Alexander thought that this was going a bit too far.<br/><br/>The main criticism I have is that old Ptolemy prattles on a bit too much in the beginning of the film. We are not all students of classical literature and it is a bit upsetting to have all these classical names thrust at us. But eventually we become engrossed in Alexander's antics so what goes before hardly matters. <br/><br/>Just let this great epic flow over you and ask yourself has the world really changed that much!"
"Hellmao","Null","1","2","1 September 2006"," Two strange conquerors
","During a battle in India, there is a beautiful slow motion sequence that freezes briefly when Alexander is challenging the unknown and powerful  the European horse versus the far bigger Indian elephant, the Greek conqueror versus the far bigger Asian mystery. To boldly go where no man haswell you get the picture. At nearly three hours, Stone takes enough time to portrait this amazing man as a conqueror that does not believe in western superiority and thus treats the people he beats in battle with unprecedented respect. Alexander the Great, the conqueror more civilized than modern onesThis part of the story is fascinating to see. Make up and art direction are fine and the presentation of two of the most important battles during that historic raid is sometimes amazing. You smell the CGI all over the place but you can't really see them right away on the big screen. Impressive.<br/><br/>Another important focus for Stone is Alexander's emotions. Since childhood, he is often surrounded by good looking males, but even in the scenes with his life-long lover Hephaistion, the most intimate they do is giving hugs, these modern hugs that spread on American television. Stone failed to make a statement here. It is widely known that bisexuality was a very common thing in those times so why make a big deal out of it? Almost 50 years ago Laurence Olivier explained in ""Spartacus"" that his taste includes both snails and oysters and Alexander admits to his suspicious wife that there are different forms of love. That is not really much of a progress.<br/><br/>The casting is odd as well. Anthony Hopkins is playing his role as a narrator no different than for a documentary on penguins. Colin Farrell is a good actor, but he never looks like an Emperor. When he desperately tries to convince his high ranks of following him even further into the unknown, he is just not mad enough for the emotional turn into madness fury he tries to deliver. Christopher Plummer just has to be wise and nobody will remember Angelina Jolie because of her acting. Val Kilmer as a lonely king and Gary Stretch as Alexander's loyal but increasingly desperate older brother save the day.<br/><br/>There are other strange things going on. Alexander's mother looks exactly the same during a stretch of 25 years, various animals escort some of the main characters, and in the last third of the movie a sudden ""Macedonia, 7 years earlier"" flashback does not make sense. Alexander's opponents in battle don't speak while the Macedonian conqueror himself cultivates a strong Irish accent. Stone was as historically accurate as possible on other occasions. The man is still a riddle. Maybe a commentary track on DVD would lift the veil, but then again  would it make a difference ?"
"andyetris","6","1","2","12 July 2006"," Sure, an' 'tis Alexandre, King o' de Grakes
","This film got such awful reviews I skipped the theatrical release, but after reading IMDb reviews that suggested it's an overlooked classic I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>The good: It's an Oliver Stone, and has some fascinating ideas and glorious moments of spectacle.<br/><br/>The bad: It's a weirdly pc-ized version of the young conqueror and the story is a rambling muddle, full of unintentionally funny moments. Stone hasn't successfully plotted a film about the charisma and tactics of a brilliant but often ruthless visionary, undermined by selfish politics. And those accents!!! <br/><br/>Alexander (Farrell) is conceptualized as a multiculturalist questing to unify a world of tyranny and petty politics. Mom Olympias (Angelina) is an embittered victim of Al's lustful dad Philip (Kilmer), taking her vengeance politically. This might work if this was the saga of Phil and Oly, but a major focus is the dynastic/ethnic politics swirling around Al, so vengeful Oly - and her... Greek?... accent - just kind of confuses things.<br/><br/>Stone's handling of the love and loyalty of men is also a major fumble, confused by the gay angle and lacking necessary buddy-ing between Al and Hephaestion (Jared Leto). Instead we get dumbth like Al soliliquizing when he should be riding to the rescue of Parmenion or grandly speechifying, to swelling background music, that his veterans should be embarrassed to go home and leave him - then going ballistic, executing the critics, and rolling on. And there are unintentionally funny moments, like Old Ptolemy (Hopkins) sententiously declaring that Alexander has captured the imagination of the world - by taking two more wives (and after the honeymoon scene with Rosario Dawson, Wife One, that really DOES capture the imagination!!!) and the hilarious scene of Al ignoring the death spasms of sick Hephaestion during a monologue on urban planning!?! The multiple accents, particularly Angelina's cross between Garbo and Elvira, are just frosting on the bundt cake.<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks this is a subtle nod to Greek tragedy has confused Euripides with Ray Harryhausen. There is no chorus of self-interested shouters in Antigone, and anyway this is not really a parable of tragic inevitabilities or overweaning ambition; it's the opposite! In fact it would have been a better film if it had been straight-forwardly the tale of a young filmmaker bucking the studios and conquering greater artistic territory while jealous subordinates try to stab him in the back..."

","But i'm not! <br/><br/>When i watch a movie i am seeking a cinematic experience and this movie falls short in this domain.The ala Gladiator war scenes of epic scale don't show at all why Alexander's tactics are so important to-date because Stone thinks that is more important to show face-to-face combat between soldiers for the most part.Or the Drama behind the hero ""my daddy doesn't love me! My mommy is younger than me!"" does not suit the theme of the movie and is out of place. <br/><br/>Some will say that the movie stays true to the facts.Well...no,it's not.Except for Phillip who is very accurate,the time-line,the explanations as for why would Alexander start his campaign,showing Aristotle teaching other children as well,the love with Hyphastion (in truth he nearly beat him to death one time,because Hyphastion laughed at his presence! Which led to Hyphastion returning home),and showing Olympias as a witch (in truth she was accused as a witch after her son's death so she would leave Macedonia and return to her native country in Epirus,hence the accent,without claiming anything) these are completely f.u.b.a.r. <br/><br/>Alexander did not have friends (his best friend was his horse,see?)and he did not have lovers,as a student of Aristotle he was abstemious and was living his life in ""ethos"" (he executed in front of all his army one of his soldiers who had raped a woman-prisoner/slave).He was a tactical mastermind by the time he was 20y.o. and a great leader but we don't see the why or the how in this movie. Beautiful was the music by Vangelis,and the cinematography,the costumes and clever was the use of accents to depict the gathering of all the city-states. I am not saying it is a bad movie,i'm just saying that the same script could be used with any other name on top and it would not make a difference. <br/><br/>Ps. Oh! And something else; going through the comments for this movie, i stumbled across many reviewers who have opinions for as if Alexander (the name Alexandros means gatherer of men as ""alexikerauvno"" means gatherer of thunders)or Olympias (that's easy,think Mt.Olympus) were Greek or Slav or whatever,well.. you could read a book!

I am thrilled to learn it is an accurate representation of times and events, but there is no excuse for a movie that can't keep one's attention and is so convoluted that one doesn't actually care that much how it all turns out. Too long, too slow. The challenge for a movie maker is to create art within a framework that makes it flow to the viewer seamlessly and engagingly. I don't think Stone accomplished it this time. The scenes were disjointed and seemed to assume that the viewer knew ancient history well enough to infer a great deal. For someone coming in with limited knowledge of the time, I found myself lost. Plus Angelina Jolie as Farrell's mom? Please."
"makawahi","5","1","2","3 June 2006"," Alexander... hmmm...
","I found this movie to be better than Troy. The latter took the traditional approach, burley men fighting for country, love, pride, and greed. Troy has a lot of eye candy and some great battle scenes. But, there really is no true character development nor any reason to connect to the characters.<br/><br/>Alexander, on the other hand, is an entire cinematic presentation that delves into the development and drama of the characters. It evokes the melodrama of the troubled soul that is presented in modern interpretations of Greek tragedies. Just as Shakespeare used words, Oliver Stone uses cinematography and other cinematic licenses to draw the viewer into the turmoil of the protagonist's mind.<br/><br/>For the most part, Stone's movies annoy me. It's not that they are not done well, it's just I don't need symbolisms, metaphors, or the purpose of the flick to be drilled into my head. However, like he does with most of his movies, he seeks out facts to cover carefully. He approaches the acts of sex as it was, not as something that people spent hours pondering and questioning if men sharing beds with other men was a dilemma of morality. He gives a rather accurate portrayal of Babylon. He also presents the battle scene of the armored elephants, a topic that has been sketchy in most representations, either cinematically or literary. But with his accurate presentations, he leaves out Alexander's essential conquering of the Persians. This pursuit is what drove Alexander east of Babylon.<br/><br/>So, is Alexander a great movie? Not really, but nor is it a bad movie. It is mostly eye candy that makes you think. You think ""did Stone really have to slap us face and say ""look, look, symbolism, everything is RED""? Did Alexander really have to have blonde hair and make you ponder images of the foppish Caligula? Did Jolie, have to use that funky accent? Finally, it makes you go to the history books to relearn what you think know about Alexander the Great."
"Alfriend","Null","1","2","27 May 2006"," Good effort, but misses the mark, Rent the Richard Burton version.
","The story of Alexander is a tough one to tackle. There is much that is known about Alexander's campaign's and the Generals who fought alongside him. But Alexander himself remains an enigma in many ways and Mr. Stone does little to help us. Why after all does Alexander spend so many years dragging his armies across to the far lands of India and Asia, when he has already conquered the long-time enemy of Greece, the Perisan empire? There had to be something more than conquest. Alexander was the pupil of Aristotle. This is no small point. Aristotle is a man who influenced thought for over two thousand years and still does today. Can we imagine that his pupil Alexander was not influenced by such a man to do something more than be a conquerer? It is true that there was a great deal of (for the time) scientific research done. Species of animals and plants were sent back to Aristotle's school for study and many of the conquered lands had schools of philosophy established that lasted for many hundreds of years. Alexander and Aristotle spent much time corresponding to one another while Alexander was away campaigning. There were recorded discussions that including a great deal about learning as well as religious and mysterious rites. Perhaps something could have been made out of this?<br/><br/>It is hard to sustain the story because we really don't get a sense in the film about why Alexander needs to continue. Glory is not enough of a reason. In a similar vein this is also such in the recent film version of Troy. Achilles' desire for glory and a short life seems silly and superficial in context of the actual size and heroics of the actual characters of Homer's tale. So it is with Alexander and after a while our interest is lost.<br/><br/>Many of the special effects, especially in the eagle-eye shots in the battle against the Persians are imaginative and inspired. The Persian palace and gardens seem like they are from a world of long ago and retain a mystery that is compelling.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins turns in his usually good performance as old Ptolomy. Val Kilmer does a good turn as Philip in spite of some heavy scene-chewing. Angelina Joli is way out of her depth in the role of Alexander's powerful mother. She seems to be doing a bad Bela Lugosi impression most of the time. Christopher Plummer is wasted as Aristotle. In this film he is treated as a run-of-the-mill tutor of a royal pupil. <br/><br/>Colin Ferrel seems lost in a role that is also not written very well. This is a part that requires an actor of size and also one well-versed in portraying classical roles. For example, there is an early 1950's version of the life of Alexander with a young Richard Burton as the golden-haired conquerer. The plot is similar and the special effects are of course nothing compared to today, but the film is far better in large part due to Mr. Burton's charismatic portrayal. The storyline in this film suggests Alexander almost as a precursor of the Christian era to come and works far better than Stone's version.<br/><br/>Stone should have spent more time working out the story and gotten an Alexander that could really carry a film of this size. (But who?)"
"smatysia","4","1","2","4 April 2006"," Stone over-directs, as usual
","I really should have known better than to watch an Oliver Stone movie on a historical subject. He is, or was, capable of making entertaining movies, such as Wall Street or U-Turn. But these days he seems more interested in making ""art"". Some of the acting was OK, given the script, such as Anthony Hopkins and Rosario Dawson. But the script was terrible. Stone apparently wanted to make some kind of point about homosexuality. Okay, we all know about Greeks, past and present. It's kind of revolting, though, having this pushed into our faces about a historical figure. I'm no scholar about Alexandar, but from what I have read, war and conquest were all he ever really cared about. I didn't think Colin Farrell was very good, but he may have been handicapped by the script, and by Stone. He seemed like such a talent in Tigerland. Which brings us to the worst thing about this film, the usual Oliver Stone over-directing. Overall, the cuts back and forth in time were done poorly, making the whole film seem disjointed. And the washout colors during and after the Indian battle scene were awful. The cutting camera action was pretty bad, too, but I suppose this was done to cover up the computer-generated war elephants. I could write more, but I'll just say that you should skip this one."
"DonFishies","7","1","2","12 December 2005"," Alexander: Director's Cut is not all that bad.
","So I finished Alexander: Director's Cut today. And yeah, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.<br/><br/>The first 90 minutes was very well done, and very well paced. But after that, it just becomes meddled in confusion, with the two plot lines of him growing up, and his rule showing up every 5 minutes. Like at least Godfather Part II had many moments pacing, this was strictly back-and-forth type meddling. And none of the characters are all too memorable, other than his gay lover, so you never know who's talking or who's being killed for defying the King.<br/><br/>The acting isn't anything to jump up and down about either. Rosario Dawson and Jared Leto are criminally underused (although the sex scene between Farrell and Dawson was pretty hot, showing everything you could ever imagine), while Angelina Jolie shows up a little too often. Colin Farrell tries his very best with his awful hairpiece, but falls short due to some of the silly dialog that Stone comes up with for his characters to use. Historically accurate or not, the characters don't have to come off as retarded.<br/><br/>The obvious standouts are Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins in a basic cameo role. They both do well for what they have, and show off the acting chops that nobody else can.<br/><br/>The prevalent homosexual elements did not bother me all that much, but yes, they are prevalent. I had heard Farrell and Leto kiss, but did not see anything of the sort other than horrendous flirting. I did however see Farrell hop into bed naked (yes, everything is shown to the camera), and then gets another male lover to hop in. While not disturbing, it did come off to me as the key gayest moment in the film.<br/><br/>The action scenes are all very well done, showcasing the gore and violence that Troy missed out on. With the exception of the final moment's of the scene with Alexander's army fighting the India army with their elephant, they're all well coordinated and well filmed. Yeah, there is some pretty fast cutting, but not to the point of Batman Begins. As for the fight scene in India, it starts off well, but when it comes to the conclusion, everything goes red and its totally hard to see or understand just what was going on. Yeah, this may be a great effect, but neon red Stone? To the point where it's so bright you can't see a bloody thing? <br/><br/>Another misplaced item is the score by Vangelis. It's totally not epic, and some of the battle scene music seems a little too upbeat for people murdering each other on a battlefield. There were a small amount that did fit the music, but the majority was totally inappropriate, bringing up the ""wtf was Stone thinking?"" question.<br/><br/>Now here is what I don't understand.<br/><br/>The real person, Alexander, was a bi-sexual. History tells us that. And history also tells us that Oliver Stone is a hack, exploitive film director. So does it come to anyone's surprise that he upped the gay level? Because it sure does not surprise me.<br/><br/>And why the hell did he need to chop out about 18 minutes of this bloated epic, and add 9 more back in for this Director's Cut? Because that doesn't make sense either. From what I heard, the music is in different places, and some of the scenes have been moved around too. So maybe I will have to watch the Theatrical Version to fully see Oliver Stone's original vision.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie at all, it just could have been done much better and much smoother than it was. And of course, I still face the obligatory knowledge that Oliver Stone still has yet to impress me as a director.<br/><br/>7/10."

","It would be hard to tell which are the Barbarians and which are the ""civilized"" Macedonians, so much kohl and mascara abounds on the chisel-cheekboned, long-tressed warriors of both persuasions, if it were not for the Irish accents of the Macedonians and the vaguely pan-Eastern-European/Russian accents of the Barbarians. It seems that long before the Pelasgians, Dorians and Hellenes arrived in Greece and Asia Minor, there were the Irish and the White Russians. Thus, Val Kilmer and Jared Leto (Americans) sport Irish brogues to match the accent of the Irish-born lead, Colin Farrel (who can do a pretty good American accent, incidentally) and Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson emote in cheesy Russian accents. Dawson gets off the best line, after observing Farrel (as Alexander) and Leto (as Hephaiestion, Alexander's long-time bosom friend and boy-toy) standing talking, ""Choo luff chhheeem!"". Why not just have them all talk ""American""? Well, they weren't given much in the way of interesting dialog, and I guess that Farrel thought that if he yelled his lines, people might think he was serious.<br/><br/>To be fair, and to rate this tedious, talky movie a 6 rather than 5, the photography and scenery are beautiful, the battle-scenes are awesome and realistic clashes between vast armies, director Oliver Stone did not stint on the vivid and authentic costuming and set decoration, and there are some great visual f/x and dream sequences."

I feel instead of telling a story, they made it a narrative. 'Alexander' really had the potential to be this captivating movie, but it never took flight as one.<br/><br/>The battle scenes aren't very good at all. They seem very static and scattered. Especially compared to the brilliant ones we've seen in recent movies. And the part that was tinted red was just ridiculous.

Anthony Hopkins is a pleasure to watch, as always.<br/><br/>I really would have love to seen more on the life of Alexander. It would have been nice if they actually did explore his sexuality more(however, I did see the new director's cut, so it might be more down-toned), because that was Alexander's life. The flashbacks were annoying and unnecessary. The story should have been told in order, letting us into the life of Alexander.<br/><br/>You can feel that everything in this movie has a point.

Being the leader of the world at the time, he seems to not demonstrate his immense personal strength except in one scene where he addresses the troops before a battle ( and the obligatory scene with breaking the wild stallion as a boy) it is inferred that it is by birth he is king which is why the Macedonians follow him to the end of the earth although they tire of that as well, when in fact he could not have achieved this greatness without the strength inherent in few men.

","The movie is too long, too wordy, the script muddled, at times even ridiculous, and the special effects not particularly special. Yet, the movie has some redeeming qualities. First, it depicts, albeit in a contorted way, the life of one the most interesting and famous persons in history, Alexander the Great. Second, Colin Farrell gives a strenuous, although not entirely believable, performance, and what it lacks in quality, he makes up for it in sheer determination. Then again, maybe it was asking a bit too much from Mr. Farrell to play a Macedonian and to portray the character not so much as a conqueror but as a person in conflict, with himself, his companions and his family. Maybe the movie misses the mark by concentrating more on Alexander's personal issues and less on what he actually accomplished. For Alexander's accomplishments in and of themselves could have provided more than enough material upon which to base a drama. That Alexander is depicted as constantly bickering with his companions and even having some kind of strange relationship with his wife detracts from the fundamental premise of the movie - that Alexander was a special person who accomplished a lot in a relatively brief period of time. One should be warned that if you are expecting a documentary about Alexander, this is not the movie to watch. Nevertheless, this movie is still worth a look. It's not the greatest movie, far from it, but at least it will let you know that Alexander DID exist, that he DID conquer almost all of the known world and that what he DID still generates interest 2,500 years later."

","If I admit that watching Bob Sponge Squarepants left me more satisfied than seeing this film, a certain injustice still remains. Could it be because of Alexander's lack of simplicity in resolving the film in the Hollywood way? Would it be unfair because Alexander the Great is more important than Bob Sponge Squarepants? However, the king of Persia resembled a lot to Bin Laden... <br/><br/>I forgive Stone for keeping me sitting down during three hours and without an intermezzo, thanks to the excellent descriptions of the battles of those days. How hard it would have been to be standing on foot in front of thousands of sharpened 'pillums' . And to be continuously pushed forward to keep on charging against that type of enemy. <br/><br/>But there is no description about the source of Alexander the Great's strategy, that was not coming from his guts, but from his master, Aristotle's (one of the world greatest philosophers of all times), lessons of Physics and Geography (in this order). <br/><br/>But the film prefers to picture the genes that he inherited and rarely justifies Alexander's crusades, as the character himself recognizes several times. <br/><br/>If I would like to describe Alexander's psychology, instead of describing his mother so insistently, it would be wise to describe the fearful environment that might have ruled over Greece at those days because of the Persians. <br/><br/>And to understand that Alexander and his men were not moved by megalomania or a boyscout spirit when they invaded, conquered and defied fear, it would only be required to know a little about Greece and their myths like the incursions to unknown lands of the Argonauts and their search for the Golden Fleece (a sort of trophy like the Holly Grial) story as an incentive for the young seeking for adventures. <br/><br/>I don't know much about history, but I suppose, that most of Alexander's warrior spirit is also owed to Aristotle's, his former tutor, lessons. Since philosophers' thinking dynamics are similar to invasions: they risk into the unknown, they keep on overlapping and extending their fighting surface (or information) and finally they assimilate it all. That might be why, Alexander used to respect all the conquered religions, and associated with the conquered regents. Because his confidence was in his ideas, and not in the weapons used. This part of history might have done a classic movie in other circumstances, what a shame."

","It would seem to be hard to make a bad movie of such a subject as the history of Alexander the Great - yet Hollywood has failed hard twice, even 50 years apart! The old 1950s version with Richard Burton seemed to lose momentum and interest halfway through. I saw it in a movie screen in the early 1960s, again in VHS, and, with the proximity of the Oliver Stone blockbuster, got a DVD version at a special price just recently. Always a disappointment. But the new version is a total disaster. The cast - only Anthony Hopkins is decent as old Ptolomey. The rest of the stars, without exception, are just plain awful. The story - they miss some of the great battles, like the siege of Tyre and Issus (where Alexander almost lost to the Persians); also, some of the great scenes, like the Gordian knot. Only Gaugamela is shown in some detail and it is not even a good movie battle! The characters - none of the main characters (Alexander, Philip, Olympia) has even the smallest attractiveness that will make a movie watcher empathize with them. And where are Cleopatra (Alexander's sister), Alexander of Epirus, Mennon? The beginning - to make sure we dislike it from the start, the birth and serpent scenes at the start insure the audiences being repelled from the start. A recommendation - do go and see it! You just will not believe how bad is it unless you do. A second recommendation - read the Valerio Massimo Manfredi trilogy on Alexander. The movie is supposed to somehow be based on this; believe me, the books are much better!"

'Alexanders riding his dark horse thru a flurry of Persian warriors fights bravely' fade to black screen. fade back to movie. 'he's now walking in to his newly acquired Babylonian estate to see that Hephaistion as beat him there and is lying on the couch with powdered behind along with a bunch of Persian transvestites"" movie fades out to the ""Fortune favors the bold"" then changes to "" Alexander<br/><br/>Coming Fall 2004 "". but anyway don't believe it's what the previews made you think."

","Most people who go to see 'Alexander' are doing so to see if it is really as bad as all the critics have made out. Well- it isn't quite as bad. Certainly the cast all overact and the script is poor but 'Alexander is basically just an old-fashioned sword-and-sandals epic and these have always been standard elements in this type of film. Colin Farrell does his best but is seriously miscast in the role of the eponymous hero. The entire Macedonian army speak with some variation of an Irish or Scottish accent (although why this should be any more unacceptable than them all speaking with American accents, I'm not really sure). Despite the thousands of miles travelled over many years, you never really get the feeling of space and time that Alexander's journey should convey. The film feels quite studio-bound in the main and it is left to computer graphics and the obligatory thunderous Vangelis soundtrack to create the illusion of a vast audio-visual experience. However we should be grateful at least that Oliver Stone has made a genuine attempt to tell a real story based on actual events from Ancient History.Although the ending is a long time coming, I actually found it quite moving"

","I'm a fan of Oliver Stone and admit he gets a bit zealous in his understanding and retelling of history. This saga recounts Alexander(Colin Farrell)the young Macedonian King that conquered most of the world that existed in his lifetime. Leading his expansive tour of fighting, but not all faithful followers through battlefields that included a scorching Persia to snow-covered peaks in India. Even his battle with a new tribe of man called ""monkey"". Not as pompous as his father Philip(Val Kilmer)and not totally as ambitious as his mother Olympias(Angelina Jolie); he lived most of his dreams of power, glory and adventure...only to die rather lonely with the lands he conquered in some confusion.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were awesome. The much talked about promotion of homosexuality did not confound or really irritate me, because I took it as it was probably intended...showing an attitude and sign of the times. I didn't view this movie expecting to change my thoughts on history, but watched it as a spectacle. I was entertained, but doubtful if I would watch it again. I thought Farrell was good in spite of the blonde hair. Jolie excelled in her role and was easy to feel sympathy for. Can't say much about Jared Leto and am less impressed with Rosario Dawson. Anthony Hopkins's narration at times was not needed and other times down right laughable. I hate to think of this as an Oliver Stone folly."

","The life and the conquest of Alexander the Great had fascinated the imagination of many historians and history-lovers, like me. After some great movies about approximately the same era (i.e. ""Troy"", ""Gladiator"", etc.), I expected that this movie won't be less than remarkable, especially if Angelina Jolie is playing an important role in the movie. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone did everything wrong in this movie - First of all, the acting is awful. Jolie and Hopkins do a great job, what can't be said about the rest of the cast (especially not the one who played Alexander himself). Second of all, the plot is very confused and confusing. The most important issues are omitted (except the war against the Parsians), and most of the movies circles about the sexual life of Alexander. While the movie indicates itself biographic, It's not supposed to be a documentary film. Final conclusion, don't spend your money on this movie. It would be more worth to see ""Troy"" again, and understand how a GREAT war movie is made."

One of my favorite parts was the soaring hawk over the first battlefield, nicely done. Suggested the spirit of Alexander, at the same time let you wonder what the hawk was thinking watching the carnage. Is it safe to swoop down and grab a limb, etc. Is there really another species as predatory as mine?

"ahmed_kafafi","Null","1","2","21 December 2004"," Alexander and globalisation
","Alexander did not meet the expectations of the average movie-lover. The American critics have been out expressing dismay at the production while comparing it with Troy and Gladiator. Criticisms of the film, however, have focused on technical aspects that are hard to look upon as the sole tally of failure or success. In Alexander attention is likely to focus on how to tailor the many and diverse details of the biography for a three hour drama. In Troy and Gladiator the mythical aspect could only allow of a simple story-line that was overshadowed by the high production techniques employed to picture the battles. But with Alexander, a fully realistic account tinged with myth, it was difficult to undertake a similar task. It would not have been acceptable to give myth the upper hand in a treatment that depicts the life of a significant pioneer as Alexander. Obviously Alexander's history corresponds with a current political trend: globalisation with a Western nation being the main player in turning it into a reality. <br/><br/>Itis hard to underline that globalisation was Oliver Stone's major concern that had to crowd out the hero's multi-faceted biography. However, it is important for one to consider how the film has unfolded along these two lines. Here is an extraordinary hero who for the first time in history is deviating from the ideals of nationalism and military glories. This is the student of Aristotle, who comes under the influence of that all-ages scholar to imbibe a new perspective of military conquests. It is one aimed at the unification of the human race and the intermarriage between East and West. How this perspective had developed was not really clear in the episode dealing with his childhood, which focused mostly on the elements that led to his bisexuality in years to come, mainly his attachment to his semi-sorceress mother queen Olympia and the tarnished image maintained of his father, king Philip. As he set out to conquer the world no mention was ever made of Egypt, the first and one important station in his seven-year march. It was in Egypt that he first had to confront the Persians who colonised that country. It was there that the secret of his parentage, being the son of Zeus, was revealed to him at the temple of Amon, the chief Egyptian deity. We are not told he had adopted the Egyptian religion as a way to integrate into other cultures. The only reference to Alexandria are the scenes in which Ptolomey figures to relate the life-story of the hero in flashbacks. But still one good point is that his blurred sexuality consisting in his shyly expressed love for his friend Hephaistion and his desire to woo other peoples through intermarriage do go parallel with his yet immature ideal of marching further towards the East in spite of his army's pathetic condition. Alexander proposes to the daughter of Darius, the defeated Persian king after he prevails over the Persian troops in Babylon. He marries Rexona, the nomad Asian princess before he proceeds to conquer India. At two points, unlike other conquerors, he is paying homage to the conquered nations. In Babylon he is refuting the fact that the Persians were as coarse and chaotic people, as they were always told as children. In Asia he is talking of the Asians as nations who have advantage over Greece, being builders of civilisations that were ahead of Greece in time! Definitely the concept was new and as a pioneer Alexander could not help sometimes succumbing to the prejudices of his own people. Traditional imperialists, the Greek would certainly opt to assert their identity and boast of their superiority over the conquered groups. They fail to understand the philosophy underlying Alexander's move to marry a nomad princess and carry on with his ventures even when his soldiers had been fighting for eight years. At that early stage in humanity's development Alexander's plans were doomed to failure. After he died, his empire was divided into four parts and the Greek, like the Persians, Romans and many who followed emerged as mere colonisers. As for Alexander, his view with regard to world unity had remained the subject of a serious debate: Why cannot the world turn into a global village, the aim of today's world politicians? Stone might have offered part of the answer. The approach of the Greek, as given by him in that production, still stressed the obsession of today's West with the ever-present pre-eminence of the West over the East. The first clash of values as represented in the Occident ( Greece- later Rome ) and the Orient ( Persia) was hardly ever there. With the glittering towers and torch-lit avenues of Babylon, the Greek continued to regard the Persians as coarse and uncivilised. But even today Alexander is inspiring lofty and ambitious world leaders. His concept to globalise the world had faltered as will today's. This is simply because a common ideal for all nations is essential before embarking on any move towards that end. But so far Islam will remain the only successful, though the hardly-ever-cited, attempt to globalise the world. Nations are bound to have different languages, customs and outlooks as long as they exist. It is such a cumbersome task to offer an Alexander with a high entertainment value. Although there was room for improvement, still Stone, despite the diversity and complexity of Alexander, has managed to produce a thought-provoking movie, which justifies its little appeal for a pleasure-seeking cinema-goers. The matter is not yet over, for the coming productions on Alexander will show how others can improve on Oliver's work. Finally all these filmmakers will have to stand the test."

"openeyes","Null","1","2","12 December 2004"," A Disappointment of Epic Proportions
","(Minor spoilers.) A young Macedonian king manages to put an abusive father and conniving mother behind him and conquer the known world in the high-budget/low-quality epic. This was probably my most anticipated film of the year. I really wanted to like this film. I really did. I have had problems with Oliver Stone and his various agendas in the past, but his previous work made me think he was well suited for this subject matter. I was wrong. I hated this film. To paraphrase Ebert, I hated hated hated hated this movie. The film was not only bad, it was also wrong headed. The main wrong headedness concerns the gay material. The historical record seems to indicate that Alexander was at the very least bi-sexual. It'd be hard to call him homosexual since he married women and had children. (Let me say I have no problem with homosexuality in films. I particularly liked the scene in 'Spartacus' between Lawrence Oliver and Tony Curtis concerning the tastes for oysters and snails. That scene resonated, not only because of the sharp writing and first rate acting, but because it played into the theme of the film.) However, regardless of the best intentions of Oliver Stone, the studio must've been crazy to deal with that subject in a film with this budget. Prior to the film's release, it seemed like all the press about the film concerned the issue of homosexuality. Is that the main point and purpose of Alexander's celebrated life? I don't think so, but now, instead of it being a film about a man who conquered the world, it became a film about a guy who was gay. This reduction does a disservice to Alexander's life, as it would to any life by simply reducing a person to their sexual preference. Worse yet, the gay stuff simply didn't play. I saw the film on a weekend in a major Eastern city in the United States. When the gay-themed material started, snickering began in the audience. By the end of the film, most of the audience was laughing whenever anything 'gay' happened. No film costing over $150,000,000 can hope to make a profit when a large portion of the audience is laughing uproariously at the serious drama. That's wrongheadedness. And, speaking of drama, where was the story? This is the fatal flaw. Where was the freaking story? The film toyed with many areas of conflict, but didn't ultimately deliver on any of them. Was it a love story? Boy finds boy, boy marries girl, boy finds boy again? There was no compelling love story, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Was it a tale of adventure? That might've worked if they had included more action in the film. There was shockingly little battle footage in the film considering its excessive length. Was it a film about a clash of cultures, and the growth of human freedom? The film hints at that theme, but supplies little evidence. (Would it have been wrong to see more of Darius and make him a villainous counterweight to Alexander?) Ultimately, I suppose the film was ultimately about the relationship between Alexander and his parents, but that material is scattered hopelessly and ineffectively throughout the unending narrative. This film would have worked much better if Stone had honed his film down to fewer themes and incidents. Right now it is a mess. It was an out of control narrative. The script was badly flawed, relying on voice-over narration to reveal what they should have shown instead. The supporting characters in Alexander's army were also poorly drawn. Other than Ptolemy, who is gracious enough to introduce his younger self through voice-over, none of his generals and commanders stands out. They are completely interchangeable, and, as a result, one of the major conflicts in the film, the reticence of Alexander's men to continue the conquests, is substantially weakened. On the bright side, I thought the battle scenes were impressive. The sets, photography and art direction were also first-rate. These, however, were small joys. I wish this film were better, because I would like to see more historical dramas. As it dies its quick death, the executives in Hollywood will probably take it as a sign that people don't want to see historical films. Not true. We just want to see good ones."
"dancingfool4","4","1","2","12 December 2004"," oh my...
","This was one of those movies that had the occasional beautifully rendered moment, causing the viewers to raise their heads from their popcorn buckets foggily, only to dash their slim hopes yet again.<br/><br/>The story of one of the greatest, if not the greatest leaders of the ""civilized world"" is one that is truly fascinating and multi-layered. Oliver Stone unfortunately achieved neither with this movie. Instead of attempting to take the well known and not so well known characters and plumb the depths of the interwoven intrigue and emotional ties between them, he chose to make over sweeping generalizations that our jaded 21st century minds could follow. For example, instead of further exploring the trauma and turmoil that his mother and father's relationship had on him, he decided, ""Alexander was rumored to be gay, so lets stick him in a short skirt and the worst wig job I've ever seen!"" Instead of exploring the complexities of Alexander's and Hepastion's relationship, we got Jared Leto making the occasional puppy eyes at Farrell, wearing a lot of eye makeup.<br/><br/>How about trying to explain some of the conflict Alexander and his wife went through over the years, with her attempting to deal with his emotions being placed elsewhere? Instead we got one of the least sexy bedroom scenes ever filmed, even with rather in your face nudity and Farrell doing this weird growl/pant thing (I'm guessing this was supposed to be sexy).<br/><br/>Stone could of looked at how Phillip and Olympias' relationship fell to such lows, forever scarring Alexander. Instead we got another traumatizing bedroom scene (except this one was supposed to be) where we found out that Olympias really had a thing for snakes and Phillip liked his beer a bit too much.<br/><br/>While there were other issues with this film, such as the seemingly random soundtrack coming in behind yet another, slow motion closeup of Farrell's grin, or the rough transitions between Alexander's story and the retelling of it by Ptolemy 40 years later, it seems very hard to forgive the lack of good casting. And even when the casting was admirable, as in the case of Anthony Hopkins and Rosario Dawson, the characters were severely underused. Perhaps Stone didn't want actual acting to distract from this three hour spectacle.<br/><br/>The entire point of the story of Alexander is that it could not have happened with any other man. There was something magnetic about Alexander that caused hundred's of thousands of men to follow him all over Asia over thousands of miles. Farrell unfortunately lacked this magnetism, and he was not aided at all by the rather paint by numbers script. If Farrell was looking for another film to boost his image as a serious actor, I haven't the slightest idea why he picked this film.<br/><br/>What is ultimately sad about this film though, is that there are the occasional brilliant moments. Although the entire eagle imagery got rather tired by the end of the film, there's one scene with it that brings Olympias to her knees, and rightly so. In another part, we see hints of the emotional turmoil inside Alexander when he has recurring flashbacks to his childhood. In these and other moments, Stone just keeps teasing the audience with further characterization but never follows through. It's a shame really that this film loses so much steam. One can only hope that future generations do not look to this film for clarification of what Alexander the Great was truly like."
"Robert_duder","6","1","2","9 December 2004"," Unremarkable potential...added comments about directors cut
","I will begin by saying that I have been a fan of Alexander the Great since my early teens. For the better part of a decade he has been my ancient history hero. I have read many books, seen every documentary and I had an incredible teacher walk me step by step through his incredible life. So knowing that I entered into ""Alexander."" The film is the story of the Great Macedonian Conqueror and leader Alexander. Son of King Phillip and rumored to be the son of a God. The film walks us through early stories of his childhood, his friends, and the major events that turned him into a man. Early scenes focus on his father played quite well, and remarkably unrecognizable by Val Kilmer. The film than jumps to Alexander's later years although he only lived to be 33. We see his first amazing battle against Darius, King of The Persians which in essence was his first and greatest victory opening gateways to the Eastern world and eventually his entire takeover of the known world. Throughout the movie we see major events that shaped him, changed him, hurt him, and made him stronger and eventually leading to his untimely death. Every character you would expect to be in the film is there, his mother Olympias, he closest dearest friend Hephastian, Ptolemy, Darius, Aristotle.<br/><br/>The film really had so much to live up to in my expectations which makes it a difficult movie for me to watch. This film was one of my most anticipated of all times. However I do not believe I am being harsh on it because of that. I truly believe there were horrible mistakes made. However I also disagree on many fronts with the issues had by many other people watching this film. I do believe Colin Farrell had his best role in Alexander. His dialect was dry, and speeches unappealing but I don't chock that up to him whatsoever. His performance as Alexander was moving and dead on and I have never seen him in a more passionate role. I did buy Angelina Jolie as his mother because Olympias was rumored to be a conniving, evil woman who toyed with Alexander's emotions and was a twisted, young woman. Jolie plays twisted quite well. Kilmer was excellent as the overbearing, abusive, King. <br/><br/>The cast was not the issue. The script played a heavy part on this film and the script and direction quite honestly sucked!! It hurts me to say that being Oliver Stone has delivered some of the most passionate and honest, politically incorrect films (that's a good thing) we've ever seen. JFK, NIXON, Platoon etc. Alexander had Stone's style, he held no punches and he battles the Homosexuality rumors head on, and in his perfect style leaves Alexander's death a complete mystery with a line of suspects and ways that he could have died...broken heart, assassination, disease. One of the biggest misfortunes of this film was the battles...oh I mean BATTLE..single....perhaps one and a half. You cannot do a grand Epic least of all about Alexander and not have each of his amazing battles and how he won them. Instead Stone recreated brilliantly mind you with all the goriness his one great battle. The rest of the film dragged and left certain aspects to the imagination. It's a disappointing film and Stone is unfortunately to blame for poor writing, and poor directing. The film does capture the essence of the Greek culture of the time and perhaps does capture the emotion of Alexander without ever showing his accomplishments. I understand why this film is bombing and I don't recommend it to anyone who isn't just a big history fan. 5/10<br/><br/>**************New comments after seeing Alexander: Directors Cut***** I don't know if it was the additions and changes that director Oliver Stone hesitantly made to the DVD release of Alexander but it felt to be different in my second viewing. I still stand by the fact that the film has awesome potential that was left untapped. It's very true that some of the acting in the film was severely over-acted, campy even which for a big budget (HUGE) Historical Epic is rather out of place but I think everyone did what they could. I do think another actor could have grabbed onto the role of the young King Alexander better than Farrell did. I don't know if he has the acting ability to pull of this role but he does try damn hard!!! Unfortunately it does come off as a bit campy at times. I still stand by the fact that Val Kilmer's portrayal as King Phillip is brilliant!!! Razzies aside (I hate those awards!!) I give Alexander (directors cut at least) a bump in ratings because it's still very slow paced and the action is few and far between but I think it will become a classic and history buffs will enjoy it. I would just like to have seen a better time line, I don't think it was necessary to have flashbacks and it would have made the film fit together if everything was in chronological order. More battles were an absolute must. The two battles in the film were so brilliantly done than even one more in the middle would have been welcomed. This was the greatest general in history!! And I think Stone's attempt at being controversial was overused in the constant reference to Alexander's sexuality. It was good that he brought it up, but it was overused intensely!! I think in the directors cut too that they made it seem more suspicious that Alexander's death was the work of his own men and I thought the ending was better originally. Check it out for yourself!! It's not as bad as one might think. 6.5/10"

","I actually haven't seen the movie yet, but I just want to remind you that Alexander was Macedonian not Greek. About him being gay and sh**, I guess that is not true, I don't know how they came up with that idea, probably to please the Greeks. But anyway who are we to judge him if he really was. The Greeks in the time of Alexander were called Helenics and lived around the Pelopones peninsula, and they are not connected very much with the nowadays Greeks. Anyway, I think if you read a bit more history (that is not blurred with pro-Greek affection) you would know a little bit more about how things are. In the end, I'd like to suggest to the hot shots in Hollywood or wherever they may be, not to jerk around with poor historical epics (Troy sucked as well) and try to create something that is worth seeing. If that is not achievable, that try working some other profession."

"Nozze-Musica","Null","1","2","4 December 2004"," OH MY KING Alexander: YOU WERE CURSED WITH A HORRIBLE SCRIPT!
","Oliver Stone is one of the most unique film makers in recent film history, but he really struck out with this one. I will not completely lambast this film like I would Leonard Part 6, or Hot to Trot, but this one really struck out. Colin Farrell plays Alexander, and he does a fair job of it, but he is not good enough of an actor to carry a movie by himself, and this movie really isn't worth carrying. The film just wreaks of a plot and a point, I really can't figure out why the films sucks, it just does. There is absolutely no plot, it just seems to ramble on, and the awkward phraseology of ancient Greece just goes too far, it does not fit, it should, but it doesn't this movie doesn't work at all it is so silly and so overdone you really do not get the true spirit of Alexander although I get the feeling Mr. Stone tried very hard to, just really REALLY fell short. Part of the problem was there were so many homoerotic themes at least to me, making Alexander out to be gay. Not that I have a problem with that, the movie in the what Oliver Stone tried to portray it really seemed like it drowned the quality of this film, like it really took away from any accurate historical significance, and portray an entirely different myth that surrounds Alexander, in other words to me it appeared that Oliver Stone was trying to make a completely different myth to compliment Alexander the Great. I found this film very hard to sit through in places, because I felt like the story dragged on for along time, longer than it should have. The film overall had no point, it appeared to me that Stone really did not want to tell a story with this film, he just wanted to have some fun playing around with Alexander The Great, regardless of whether it was true or not. <br/><br/>Having seen the original Alexander the Great, with Richard Burton, which had it's own historical inaccuracies I watch this and I would prefer the old one because that was more character and acting driven, whereas here I could not really figure out what drove this movie, and I don't think Oliver Stone could either. The original also had decent dialogue, the words spoken by the characters were not so contrived and silly. That movie was nominated for a few Academy Awards, for this Alexander film I think the Academy should put out a hit on Oliver Stone. What results in Oliver Stone's vision of Alexander is a movie that isn't quite silly, I wasn't completely lost on the movie, but I really could not get into it either. Most of the performances, while appealing for the most part were contrived. The dialogue was unbelievable, and silly, making the actors, many of which were very talented unable to take their own parts seriously. No one in this movie really seemed into their parts, except for Val Kilmer playing Phillip, and Christopher Plummer, who plays Aristotle. No one else really seems natural, despite most everyone doing a decent job with what little they had to work with.<br/><br/>Coming out of this movie I couldn't figure out what to make of it. I didn't feel like being too critical of it, but I didn't feel like praising it, definitely didn't feel like praising it. I think the problem with this movie was Oliver Stone got his oddly erotic revisionist message across, and it was a horrible message. I do not know if Stone really wanted to write an actual account of history, he didn't, but did he really think it would? There was so much allegory and symbolism, and stirring speeches, I didn't expect this from the man who brought forward the straight-forward articulate JFK (You have to agree it was very powerful even if you disagree with the film itself.) How someone who prides himself on being so straightforward can make something that rambles on and on like this is beyond my comprehension, perhaps Stone has gotten back on drugs again, 'Hey, wouldn't it have been cool man if Alexander was gay man?' That's what it seems like here, Stone just wanted to produce some sort of silly film about Alexander the Great, but didn't want to put any thought into it, just wanted to make some movie, but almost played with history because it was fun. Stone is an effective filmmaker, he always gets his point across, and I think here is his point is that Alexander the Great lived an erotic fantasy, that he heard awkward and silly neo-Greek speeches his whole life and his entire life was filled with unique and fascinating special effects that served as symbolism for his greatness, but Stone's vision does not serve as a good movie."

This movie is more accurate and true to the story than I thought it would be. People are basing their opinions on their homophobias.

","I just saw Alexander and while I am admittedly known for my bile-spattered, vitriolic rants on movies I hate, this one takes the prize turkey for being a sheer embarrassment to Greeks, history buffs, movie fans and all people with an IQ just above that of toaster scrapings.<br/><br/>I thought Troy was fairly dull, but Alexander is the entertainment equivalent of being lulled to sleep by having your skull repeatedly rammed into the side of a whale. Not sharply painful but after about 5 minutes, REALLY f***ing annoying.<br/><br/>For some reason the entire movie is spoken in broad Irish accents, the like of which I have heard only twice before, once when I was in Dublin, and once in Gangs Of New York. It's as if Farrell was too lazy or talentless to fake an American accent (forget Greek, I no longer look for actual realism in movies) so they just told Jared Leto and Val Kilmer to do Irish ones. I defy you not to just stare in slack-jawed wonder as they make a discussion of the Macedonian dominance of Persia sound like a coffee morning with the Lucky Charms leprechauns.<br/><br/>The acting is genuinely poor, I can't even think of an appropriately scathing epithet to describe the feeble efforts of actors whose reputations scarcely match the pitiful performances here. Colin Farrell is cringeworthy, blubbing like a 13 year old girl auditioning for Our Town, whenever anyone dies. Couldn't he have come up with some sort of emotional expression beyond petulance? He seems to have only two registers, whispering and bellowing, and even his shouting somehow fails to rouse. 'RIDE MACEDONIANS, RIDE!' tapers off into a squeaky croak that I doubt the person behind him could hear, much less 50 000 thundering riders.<br/><br/>His shouted pre-battle speeches are so like those in Gladiator, Braveheart, Troy and LOTR that they are beyond clichéd, and cant really be blamed on his simpering, affected acting, but during the sex scene where he actually appears to be softly barking like a dog at his psychotic wife (where is it documented that she tried to murder him on their wedding night??) I just gave up in disgust.<br/><br/>The movie has too much voice-over narration (I'd guess about 30 minutes plus of the whole movie is nothing but Anthony Hopkins talking) and far too little story. I was left asking 'Yes but why did he do this, or who was that, or what was the plan here?' while I was subjected to what seemed like hours of male bonding, as Alexander and his buddies all lay around chatting, arguing and watching belly dancers. How did all this add up to $150 million?<br/><br/>If you are interested in history, don't waste your time on this movie, get a book instead. If you like epic battle scenes á la LOTR, you will be grievously disappointed as both scenes in Alexander are abruptly truncated, blurry and consist mainly of watching Farrell's meaty thighs wrapped round a horse, while he rides past a quarter of a million fighters presumably doing things I'd rather watch than what I'm actually being shown.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie, who I normally would happily watch changing a light bulb, does bugger all but sit around sulking and whining in a Bride of Dracula accent (kudos for her though for presumably refusing to attend the Irish Dialect Workshop with the others) <br/><br/>I could find nothing of merit in this film, not even the breathtaking shots of the Hindu Kush, because even then I've seen photography as impressive in TV documentaries. <br/><br/>It has all of the cinematic charm of watching the Hulk (ie NONE), but without the cool special effects."

","Alexander (2004)<br/><br/>Directed By: Oliver Stone<br/><br/>Starring: Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto, and Rosario Dawson<br/><br/>From guts and gore director Oliver Stone (Platoon, Natural Born Killers) comes the epic tale of the little conqueror that could and big-budget screw-up of a film that didn't come close. In his film's fruitless attempt to encapsulate the aura and mystique of Alexander the Great, Stone sinks to a pitiful cinematic low.<br/><br/>An aging Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) in capitol annoyance tells the glorious tale of Alexander the Great (Minority Report's Colin Farrell), the Macedonian king who conquered the known world at the age of 32. Under the seductively manipulating control of his mother, Olympias (Girl, Interrupted's Angelina Jolie) and the sporadically violent rule of his father, King Philip (Val Kilmer), Alexander is what I would jokingly characterize as an 'at-risk teen.' After the death of his father, Alexander vows to do what all the great rulers before him had aspired for, but had never achieved, world domination. During his endeavor east, Alexander takes a Persian wife (Rosario Dawson), much to the discontent of his all-Macedonian comrades whom want Alexander's heir to be of pure Macedonian blood. Alexander's true love-interest (as demonstrated blatantly throughout the film), is however a man yes, children I said a man. Hephaistion (Jared Leto) is Alexander's childhood friend turned forbidden love. Through the lands of Persia, to the far east of India, Alexander's quest comes to a much welcome end and the audience puts the sporks they had been planning to poke their eyeballs out with back into their pockets. <br/><br/>One would expect this epic story of world domination and personal triumph would involve scenes of jarring, realistic battles, lustful, steamy romances, piercing agony, and joyous victory. Ah, but that would be far too entertaining for this film. No, far better for the film to make the audience yearn to hurl-up their popcorn and eat it once more in exchange for a refund. Far better for this near three-hour slice of thematic feces to make bashing your head in with a rotten banana seem enticing. In place of the jarring battle sequences are confusing, mindless, disorganized fly-bys where the viewer cannot differentiate between an elephant and a spear! In place of the steamy sex scenes are pointless breast-flashings and downward pan-shots that get dangerously close to Farrell's naughty bits. Instead of meaningful scenes of both Alexander's agony and victory there are supremely irritating, random shots of Farrell and others at supremely irritating, random times. The viewer cannot possibly root for Alexander. Portrayed in one scene as a unifying hero, and in the next as a dividing tyrant, Stone has managed to baffle the audience in their support or hatred for the 'protagonist.' With the lone exception of Kilmer's performance as Philip, the acting in this film is deplorable. Jolie utilizes a hybrid accent concocted mainly of Arabian, Alabaman, and Russian (Arabamussian) that can be characterized only as laughable. Hopkins' Ptolemy, the narrator of the film, speaks nothing but inane drivel and I just plain wanted to shoot him. Leto, as Alexander's sexy wannabe man-lover delivers what would be a half-decent performance. Why not decent, you ask? Well, my theory is thus: due to Leto and Farrell's constant 'manly bonding,' words of endearment, exposed man-tits, and most especially their deep, black eye-liner reminds the audience too much of a gay porno and thus scares them crapless.<br/><br/>I've got three letters and one word for Mr. Stone. WTF mate? This was, without question one of the most poorly written, directed, and acted movies of the past half-century. The battle scenes almost gave me a migraine, style was completely absent, there was more pansy action than real fighting, and for the love of God Jolie's accent was repulsive. I love ripping into a juicy piece of cinematic crap now and again, but I wasted five bucks doing it. The best parts of Alexander were, 1.the end, and 2. The Phantom of the Opera trailer preceding it. If you're just sitting at home and feel like a nice vomit session would do you some good or if you're sitting at home wishing you had a good reason to pull out your toe nails one by one with some rusty pliers, kill two birds with one ""Stone"" (hahahaha get it?) and go see Alexander. <br/><br/>2/10"

","Alexander was a deeply disappointing movie for me. I had initially assumed it would be rife with revisionism, added to avoid offending the sensibilities of modern movie-goers, please note I consider the Greeks of two thousand years ago to have been far more enlightened than post Judeo-Christian cultures replete as they are with institutionalized hang ups and prejudices, however when I started to read the furore about Alexander being depicted as bisexual I thought that after all I would give the movie a chance.<br/><br/>Having read about Alexander's life, campaigns and major battles I had no problem following the movie and believe it stayed (within acceptable limits of Hollywood artistic license) fairly true to what we currently know about Alexander. My perspective, however, allowed me to fill in the many gaps where Oliver Stone left someone not previously familiar with Alexander's life foundering and also missed key opportunities to define Alexander better.<br/><br/>The battle of Gaugamela was in my opinion incomprehensible to someone who hadnt previously read about it.<br/><br/>Alexander's achievements remain unsurpassed by any other military commander in history. This was a great leader and motivator, a supremely powerful individual who could cow, lead and easily eclipse a group of also powerful leaders, his immediate lieutenants ie Ptolemy, Cassander et al, who themselves went on after his death to carve out large kingdoms and successfully lead large armies.<br/><br/>Between Stones' direction and Farrell's performance the strength, confidence, leadership and charisma that the real Alexander would undoubtedly have needed simply weren't there. Too much angst and self doubt.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe in Colin Farrell's Alexander and that combined with the choppy, confused storytelling were my two major gripes."

","Colin Farrell is such a vibrant masculine man, as is my ideal of Alexander the Great........this movie and depiction of Alexander is not. There were parts that could have been EPIC, yet not! Oliver Stone's written characterization of Alexander was degrading. He tells a story of boy warped and brow beaten by psychotic parents. A story of what we are to believe was the greatest general and conqueror of all time, yet he depicts him as a ""why can't we all get along"" crybaby. Stone's Alexander was running away from an overbearing mama, and constantly being compared to his father. Why? We know nothing, historically, of his parental dynamics...so why would anyone attempt to capture so much of that on film? Why wasn't this more about what we know to be true? Alexanders sexual preferences are really unimportant, what record there is...is only innuendo. This movie should have been a cable television mini-series and I should have bought a ticket to The Incredibles instead."

","I wanted to like this film: I like historical epics (even if they're not exactly accurate), I enjoy battle flicks and I was in Morocco when A-t-G was being filmed so had an extra personal interest. Before the movie started, we pooled our limited knowledge: he was supposed to have killed his father, Dar'ius (pronounced differently), warring Greek states (okay so we weren't sure about Peloponnesian wars and Persia), conqueror of the world, blood-thirsty megalomaniac, buried in Alexandria (Egypt), admired by descendants of Ptolemy, Bucephalus, gay (we hadn't heard about the controversy raging), conflicting reports about his death. Underinformed as I was, I still find it incredible that Stone produced a romanticised portrayal--his humanistic ""melting pot"" multicultural Alex seemed way off the historical mark. Remember marriages pre-19th century were typically political/economical so don't read too much into A's weddings and offspring. I did like the way Stone dealt with the controversial death (virus-type fever ie dengue, malaria, hepatitis a, or poison?). Overall, the film was overacted, overwritten and underedited. (What was with the Age-of-Empires Babylon?). Most memorable screen appearance: Jolie's nipples. Least appealing? Farrell's hair--worst since Kevin Costner's in ""The Bodyguard"". Most frustrating: the endlessly repetitive soliloquies (much of which seemed to be sampled from Shakespeare's Henry V's St Crispen Day speech) . I guess it was to be (to quote Kelsey Grammar) an uplifting tragedy (!). Spend your pennies on ""Hero"" it's a much better movie."

","I already said my opinion this movie is very bad. I love Oliverstonemovies and I real admire his art but this time it was typical ordinary movie with some action here and their. The only thing that get my attention is the similarity between the Iraqi liberation war and this story. There many incidents that says that this guy is trying to address the war on Iraq with this story but he fails because he presented it in a very stupid way. Babylon, the gold he is after the dictator King of Persia all of it as if he is talking about the current Iraq. I know Oliverstone says the Bush went for the war in Iraq for the oil but I disagree with him as there are people their they deserve to live freely and the war was truly freed the people their. The Americans and the other soldiers in Iraq are doing great job no matter what the leftists said about the war. The most important thing is what the Iraqi people are saying and I think they are thanking the Americans for librating them."
"jeremyeve","4","1","2","5 December 2004"," The Alexander I didn't expect to see
","I can see that plenty has been said about this movie already, so I'll try not to become too repetitive. After being enticed by a fairly well done trailer, I anticipated this film quite a bit. Knowing the director, I was hoping for a little better than your typical Hollywood flick, which tends to follow mundane mainstreams. So, I cannot honestly fault Stone in creating something I truly didn't expect. You cannot fault someone for creating something his or her style, for we all know this is what art is. But please, for all our sakes, don't make a trailer that tantalizes our interest, and do ones best to stray from it. I'm always a sucker for ancient war scenes, but only two? Stone must have been on a tight budget. Second surprise, the hashing and rehashing of Alex's interest in men, enough already, point taken. I can see some sort of point Stone was trying to make, that our heroes in truth are nothing, as we perceive them to be. But was Alexander, labeled 'the great' really such a pathetic, indecisive, poor tactician? I didn't see how a leader of any group with his 'abilities' establish himself into our history as much of anything but a spoiled, lucky in war SOB! I truly believe that Anthony Hopkins must have been speaking of someone else in his praised filled dialogue. <br/><br/>I gave it 4/10, I don't want to totally discourage directors from creating historical films!"

It struck me as a cross between ""Troy"" and ""Birdcage"". the fight scenes were fair to good but a bit on the gory side, and i knew going into the movie that Alexander was bisexual but they seemed to focus more on his homosexual relationship than any other part of his life and there were huge gaps in the time line that left a feeling of confusion and disappointment. these gaps are intensified by flashbacks and flash fronts to Anthony Hopkins telling the story. the lack of substance is staggering since this was a three hour movie. the combination of these left me wishing i hadn't wasted that much of my precious time watching this movie. many of the scenes are eerie but don't seem to convey any pertinent facts or messages about Alexander. the one thing they did convey was that Alexander was indeed great (which he was by any man's account)."

Here's a clue Mr. Oliver Stone, although you seem and probably are a homosexual try to not film a Hollywood blockbuster reminiscent of a gay soap opera. I will say the acting was good, but did the acting lead to a real point? no not at all. A total waste of talent. Before this movie i liked colin farrel and his movies, i thought he was damned good. After this movie, I'm not too sure i like him. that's how bad this show simply repulsed me. Everything about this show flat out sucks.

","Here we have the film version of the life and times of King Alexander III of Macedon, aka ""Alexander the Great"". It might be hard for moviegoers to swallow but the life of the actual king was more violent and betrayal filled than the film. He is known to have been a heavy and excessive drinker who was impulsive and had a bad temper. He also likely had a homosexual lover since boyhood named Hephaestion (the Jared Leto role). His mother Olympias was also likely more evil than the Angelina Jolie character here, once forcing a woman to kill her own child and then forcing her to hang herself. Nice family that Alexander had. Alexander was by reports an excellent general and an exceptionally handsome and athletic man who set a fashion for the clean-shaven, short haired look. He was also fiercely loyal to his friends and men. He enjoyed the arts too. Kind of a well rounded guy for a conquering despot who called himself ""Lord of Asia"". He is thought to have eventually died of either malaria or typhoid fever. In short, a lot of what goes on here is historically based on facts known to have happened. So what went wrong? Why isn't the film more popular with such an interesting character to portray? Lets examine the results on film.<br/><br/>The general presentation of the film is more-or-less excellent, terrific costumes and sets (except the costuming of the Persian women have a more middle ages look to me). Overall art direction, editing, sound, music and stunts were all excellent. Cinematography was generally excellent except for a poor choice of infrared film in one battle sequence in India.<br/><br/>I have to lay the blame of the story presentation and direction. The battle scenes were well staged but confusing in many places in trying to explain what was going on. And although the star, Colin Farrell, did an excellent job, I can't help but feel he was led a bit astray by Stone's direction. The way the story was told was hard to fathom for people I listened to also. That jumping back and forth just added to the confusion. It was a complex story best told in straight chronology or with more narrative such as that excellently provided by Anthony Hopkins as the elder Ptolemy. Overall I enjoyed most of the individual acting performances. I think a very great film was missed here by botched story telling which I can't fault the actors with."
"jmholt87","2","1","2","26 November 2004"," Horrible History
","To start off with I do not consider myself one of those individuals who judges a film based solely on its historical correctness or closeness to the book/original, etc, but this movie goes WAY beyond my tolerance limit.<br/><br/>I understand they have to cut out and edit some parts of the history to fit it into a 3 hour movie, and I can tolerate some historical editing to make the movie run a little better but common Mr. Stone, if this movie was supposed to have been a HISTORY of Alexander, maybe you should start reading some different history books because the almost the entire history presented in this movie is WRONG, and for the record I am not talking about his relationship with Hephaistion.<br/><br/>To start with, Alexander won the battle of Gaugemela more or less before it even started. It was the SECOND time the Alexander and Darius had fought and while Alexander was outnumbered 100,000 to 40,000 the majority of the Persion army were green untrained troops who where facing what was quite possibly the best trained army in the world, NOT a bunch of military trained sheep herders as they are depicted in the movie, these guys where the BEST of the BEST. Alexander charged down a hill onto the plain of Gaugemela and the majority of the Persion army ran before even fighting.<br/><br/>The battle of Issus, quite possible one of the most pivotal engagements in History was totally cut out. In there first meeting Darius finally decided to engage Alexander with a force of roughly the same size by trapping him between a cliff and the sea. Alexander had his soldiers physically turn themselves around and lead his cavalry along the tide line and annihilated the Persion forces which Alexander to ramain unchecked while he slowly liberated Asia minor and Egypt from Persian Control.<br/><br/>And lastly on the battles. Alexander NEVER crossed the Indus river but consented to his soldiers demand to go back. The battle that is depicted on the other side is semi-accurate. At a subsidiary of the Indus he faced off against an Indian army that did have Elephants and in a brilliant bit of planned tactics Alexander won the engagement. It was his bloodiest battle but it wasn't that bloody and it was a VERY decisive victory for Alexander, and he survived the engagement unhurt.<br/><br/>Now onto Alexander's character. Colin Farell was not a wise choice as Alexander as there is something about his eyes that makes him look like he is either scared or about to cry. To things states that Alexander was very rarely if ever in. Every scene in this move feature Alexander either crying or on the point of tears, or pleading with someone, or looking shocked or looking unsure of himself . Alexander was very bold and incredibly gutsy individual, he would not have be sobbing when he made is legendary rebuke of his father about being to drunk to lead the men into Persia and he would have likely been the one to put his father's crown on his head after his murder. He would not have been unsure of himself in battle, he was to worlds greatest general and would not have been that indecisive. Alexander reputedly had very piercing eyes and such a potent aura that no one question him to his face, yet all his generals are constantly questioning him in this movie. Whether or not he was bisexual, i do not know, so the only thing I have to say about that is either portray it completely or ignore it, don't pussy foot around with it for 3 hours.<br/><br/>Minor notes: Phillip did trust Alexander for the most part and recognized his talents, making him commander of his cavalry at age 16, they only didn't get along for a short time after that argument until philips death, a couple months at most. The wars of the successors didn't begin until nearly 20 yrs after Alexanders death when his son died. There would have been little/no complaining about Alexander giving the land back to the Indian kings as that is exactly what he did with everyone he conquered, gave the land back with the promise of tribute and military aid. Those battle scenes, while realistic to any real battle situation where a little to confusing for this movie. Christopher Plummer and Brian Blessed, to great actors are totally wasted in their 3 minute parts, if you are going to hire talent like that either really use them or don't use them at all. I like Anthony Hopkins and thought he did a good job trying to give this movie some credibility.<br/><br/>On the Whole 1/5 stars, PATHETIC"

","Just when I thought nothing could be worse than TROY!<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has unfortunately lost touch with more than his usually strong ability of narration; he has completely lost touch with history. Alexander was also one of the most influential military minds ever. Not only was he an excellent and skilled commander, but the young conqueror was a masterful orator, politician and social reformist - all aspects eclipsed by his sexuality. Stone instead of focusing on the mind that was trained by the likes of Aristotle concentrated his movie on Alexander's love of men. This didn't bother me, I've studied enough of history to realize that Alexander wasn't bisexual, he was flat out gay! (Granted he had relations with women to procure sons, but that did not make him heterosexual, he was not attracted to women.) What's more important is that it didn't bother anyone of his time either! Aristotle, and popular culture of the time, asserted that the highest relationship was that between two men, an assumption that we still have to this day in literature.<br/><br/>What upset me is that the most brilliant military mind of Greek culture (and possibly of all time) was ignored so Stone could shine light on a fact that most people knew about anyway. It was no surprise to America to learn that Alexander was homosexual. Anyone who's studied even a little Greek history is well acquainted with the fact that homosexual relationships were idealized in their art, literature, mythology and society. Hell, you don't even have to go to college to know that, just watch the history channel.<br/><br/>What bothers me is that Stone used the homosexuality as a taboo for Alexander when, in fact, it was not taboo at all. His men engaged in homosexual acts with each other, with slaves, with whatever they wished, they would not have been bothered by Alexander for doing the same. It was the fact that Alexander was a social reformer that bothered them. Stone touched on this, but not to an extent that it even scrapped past the homosexual references that never ceased. Alexander conquered lands to create an empire, he knew that to keep the people from revolting he would have to be a new kind of leader and he practically invented social reform and mass education. Both of these aspects were boiled down to one scene in the film.<br/><br/>Stone was very heavy handed with the Oedipus complex, even mentioning him in the film, and painting him on the wall. (Do all film makers have to assume that their audience is really this stupid? I thought it was just Spielberg!) Stone had little faith that his audience would pick up on the sexual tension between mother and son that yes, existed in real life. Olympius is not up for mother of the year, however it was a very different time and she well understood that she would pay with her life should she outlive Alexander, and she did. However, the most upsetting scene (or disquieting really) is where the young Alexander displays an Electra complex (for lack of a better term!) for his father. Alexander has, quite literally a love/hate relationship with both parent.<br/><br/>As for acting, Colin Farrell seemed asleep in most of his scenes and the supporting cast picked up on it, not acting too loud lest they wake him. Jolie was ridiculous and ill used in this role, half the time she looked lost in her part and confused as to her semi-obsessive, semi-sexual love affair with his toddler son.<br/><br/>The only truly interesting aspect of this movie is the insight it gives us to Greek culture as well as our own, and the idealized relationships men can have with other men only. Much like Aristotle preached to the young Alexander the most noble love of all is that between two men, in which no women (the corrupting factor in all art and literature) can penetrate. Alexander idealized Achilles for his love and devotion to another man, while our society idealizes Achilles' strength and quietly brushes the sexuality under the rug. However, this idea of men leaving the society of women to bond with other men is just as prevalent in our literature as seen in Huck Finn (Come Back to the Raft, Huck Honey) and Moby Dick.<br/><br/>Please do not confuse this movie with some art-house piece. This movie is no more artfully crafted than bad porn, which it emulates at its low moments (I cite the orgy in which Phillip rapes a young man). This movie is confused and has little direction and was pretty obviously thrown together without much thought for narration and plot, I cite the many flashbacks and flash forwards and flashsideways!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the man Alexander is lost to our society which views his life now as some debauched orgy and war lust fetish. This movie should have starred Caligula, not Alexander! I'd suggest reading a book, and saving your money for something good.<br/><br/>Long story short - skip the movie, watch the history channel!"

","Alexander is NOT your typical Hollywood epic. It actually incorporates slightly experimental film-making techniques. Oliver Stone took risks in making this movie into what he did, and it was driven by an artistic, NOT monetary vision.<br/><br/>Good things: Angelina Jolie did work as Olympias. You see the way she interacts with her son as a child (who looks exactly like Colin Farrell), so the relationship carries over gracefully with believable acting. <br/><br/>Colin Farrell was incredible. All the acting done in his face alone was incredible for an action epic of this scale. He internalized the character, and Stone graciously focused in on that.

The ending scene was interesting, and I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Jared Leto as Hephaistion...I can't decide if this was under Stone's direction or if this is a casting issue, but I felt that he was attempting to seduce Alexander the entire time. That is NOT what Alexander/Hephaistion or the frequently-referred-to Achilles/Patroclus relationship is about! It's suppose to be about two boys who are childhood friends who grow up together falling in love. Playing up each individual's homosexuality was unnecessary. This year's Troy did a better job of sticking to love that develops homoerotically as opposed to homosexual characters.<br/><br/>Rosario Dawson was miscast and did nothing for the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this film deserves a few nominations.

The dramatic red colors used for Alexanders' falling were rich and raw. Alexander's war material ""very interesting"" gruesome but tolerable. Aha, I knew it would be sooner or later that the film would pin point Alexander's bisexuality! A nice modern twist on his life and loves !!!! It was a bit frustrating to view Alexanders' tale being brought out by Anthony Hopkin's character in segments (before/after/future). It would have shorten the films length if it was excluded altogether. Too bad Hopkin's character (Old Ptolemy) wasn't given the opportunity to act with Farrell or with Kilmer."
"quincy-white","Null","1","2","28 November 2004"," A Lot to Think About
","I came away from Alexander conflicted. Much of it was well-done, but not in such a way as to make a strong connection.<br/><br/>The first problem would be the dialogue, which was very overwritten. Give audiences a little credit, they can figure things out quickly. We understand there was tension among the troops when Alexander became immersed in Persian culture and when he invaded India, and we understand Alexander was conflicted about his mother's likely involvement with his father's death, and that he deeply loved Hephaistion, but minutes upon minutes of circular dialogue were unnecessary.<br/><br/>As for the relationship with Hephaistion, it would have been better to allude to it, not because of American Puritanism, but because Alexander's bisexuality/homosexuality is something historians suspect, but do not know. It is a mystery for the ages, as it was in Alexander's time. Worst of all, the Persian eunuch may be the most unnecessary and inadvertently funny characters in movie history. Yes, we all loved the Weird Naked Indian in The Doors, but such a character does not need to exist in all of Stone's movies.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were perfect, everything anyone could imagine them to be, especially the very accurate re-enactment of Guagamella. But it was only one of two. They were among the times when Stone's ambitious style works, along with the entrance into Babylon.<br/><br/>As for performances, Angelina Jolie is my favorite actress, but she could not be his mother, starting with the fact that she is younger than Colin Farrell. An all-out, A Beautiful Mind style make-up job may have pulled it off, but adding some gray and a few wrinkles around the eyes does not work.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell really shone well in the last act, with all the weariness of Alexander in his eyes. One thing the make-up crew did right was giving Alexander and his friends battle scars, rather than have them always looking perfect.<br/><br/>Still, there is one major flaw in Colin's performance and Stone's direction.<br/><br/>Historically, the real Alexander the Great was known for being fearless, or at least he never showed any fear. Alexander in this movie is too vulnerable, too afraid of his mother, his father, and all the images his father showed him in the cave. He is portrayed as a haunted man. He may have been in real life, but no one saw it in him, except in this movie where it is on constant display.<br/><br/>Gladiator, as much as some people out there may tear it apart, was that bombshell of a movie that gave people something they had not seen before, even in the Sword-and-Sandal movies of old. It and Russell Crowe's performance in it are remarkable. The movie Alexander has so much ambition but never quite got to be remarkable. I like it in spite of its problems but I did not love it because of its problems. But I would say it is worth seeing. Love it or hate it, it is a lot to think about."

","I was surprised by how truly bad this movie was. Normally, movie critics can go over the top with their critiques and are too harsh on movies. In this case, the masses got it all right! How could this movie be so bad? I admire the talent of all the actors attached to this piece but the lack of direction and script made for a mess. The mix of accents was distracting. What happened to just sticking with the old standard of everyone is to have a British accent? Despite all the emoting done in this version of Alexander, I still knew nothing about this guy and what motivated him. It takes more than select moments to show this, it takes good writing and foundation which lacked here. I was bored after 10 minutes. The attempts to deal with a homosexual theme was absolutely ridiculous...either you are going to go all out or not go there at all. The homoerotic glances, and hugs were just dumb and induced many a deserving snicker in the theater. I was truly disappointed...this movie will probably be the worst movie of the year!"

Just look at the map of ancient world to understand the geographical meaning of Persia. Maybe Alexander, who is known as the destroyer of Persian kingdom, is a Marsian guy with his laser gun. But when the Greek historian wrote that he captured Persia by his horses and swords, it is just a joke. It was a dream for the little Greece to capture Persia, and never happened but in the epical stories. The fall of empire in those times, was not something like changing the power by election. It took 80 years for Parthia kingdom to concur whole the land. Actually Alexander and his troop entered Iran from west. ( Persia in that time was from Palestine to India). He could capture some western states of Iran and he died somewhere a land where now we know it as Iraq. After the attack of Arabs, Moslems destroyed most of the Persian documents about their history and political issues, so there are only some dreams as a real history that were written by Greek historians. I think this film was a new mission for Mr. Stone to make a new Alexander W. Bush to save Persian slaves! God bless Persia."

","Alexander was a gay who was making love with both men and women and this fact has been written in the history books since many ages. To deny this reality will never change it. The Greeks claim the heritage of him but Alexander was not a Greek and I do not understand why this intense criticism about whether he was a gay or not is coming from the Greeks. Let the Macedonians in Macedonia think this problem. I also want to add that the times when Alexander lived, being a gay was not a problem because it was very common and acceptable by the society. Because the ideas of old Greek philosophers was mentioning that a person might love anybody who he will think that he will be happy with. So we have to evaluate the sexual orientation of Alexander based on this fact. We cannot deny that Alexander was a gay on the ground that he was leading the world or that the Greeks are not a homo-society. That's rubbish. Plus, as I told above before, he was not a Greek. And, gays sometimes ruled the world and that's not a surprise."

So, take it for what it is, a movie, and you will most likely enjoy yourself watching the terrific acting, the beautiful scenery and the very many excpetional actors who grace the scenes. I do wish there were more battle scenes and a little better of an actor to play young Alexander. The scenes with him as a child are alright, but it doesn't get real good until he is older. I would of thought some more historical events would have made the movie far more dramatic, but I am not Oliver Stone, and he did a great job none the less. Some scenes may bother some people, there is some kissing scenes between men, however they do not depict Alexander as an outright homosexual they do introduce to the audience that homosexuality or bisexuality could have been common place among men at the time.

","Alexander: 1) becomes King because Daddy was King before him. 2) Is immature, callow, self-absorbed, none too bright. 3) Is mentally and morally unequal to the absolute power he wields. 4)Believes he rules by divine right, and is destined by the gods to conquer the world and bring Hellenic ""civilization"" and ""freedom"" to the huddled masses elsewhere, grovelling under dictatorships. 5) Irrationally believes that the way to bring ""freedom"" to them is to march his troops and heavy armaments in to their cities, butchering all who resist. 6) Is indifferent to the environment as he imagines marching over the globe, ""developing"" it into a series of cities, reconstructing the natural environment for convenience of transport to Hellenic commerce. 7)Is obsessed with proving he is better than Daddy, and can be a bigger Conqueror than Daddy, who never established a base in the mideast in Babylon (Babylon is in modern day Iraq), which Alexander insisted on doing. <br/><br/>Substitute ""George W. Bush"" for Alexander in the above statements, and the trajectory of the plot's human actions and inner motives light up as a political commentary on our own times and unhappy helplessness under a destructive, none-too-bright, megalomaniac president. Unfortunately, the political references are submerged by the film's other main goal, which is to create as historically accurate an image of Alexander and Hellenic civilization as possible. <br/><br/>This accuracy means showing homosexuality as just something that most Greek men engaged in casually, without making it an ""identity,"" without foregoing sexual interest in women also, and without its being anything controversial. It also means showing the vast scope of suffering and death that Alexander inflicted, which takes not only huge and bloody battle scenes but 2 1/2 numbing hours of repetition of said violence, which nearly induces mental and moral shutdown in the viewer by overload. And because homosexuality in our time has a controversial quality that it lacked in Alexander's, this aspect tends to grab the viewer's attention away from the political one.<br/><br/>I wish I could say I liked this movie, but the excesses were too excessive, and there is a clumsiness in the way the movie is put together whose details elude me, although I think all viewers feel it. Does Oliver Stone have enough film to recut this shapeless blob into a sharper film, whose political commentary consciously comes through?

","Making a movie of Alexander the Great is an ambitious undertaking. Unfortunately Oliver Stone bit off much more than he could chew. The movie does not attempt to dramatize what made Alexander great, but rather, leaves it up to Anthony Hopkins to deliver a monologue containing a history lesson, and not an especially sophisticated one. The movie devotes most of its dramatic energy to, and is most successful with, the family dynamic among Alexander, his father (the only really convincingly played character), Alexander's mother, Alexander's Afghani wife, and Alexander's boy-friend. This stuff is the kind of small potatoes that can be seen any day of the week in the T.V. soaps. Even the battle scenes are nothing special as battle scenes and do nothing to convey what made Alexander and his army unique in military history.

I mean the camera shakes so bad that it's almost impossible to make sense of out the individual scenes. The dialogue between characters is like watching an Ed Wood movie. (Sorry Ed Wood) Angelina Jolie always has a snake or snakes around her. I kept watching this 3 hour mess and wishing I was home watching the Richard Burton version of Alexander the Great.

"TolkienRing","Null","1","2","19 November 2004"," Oh, dear... where to start? >< CONTAINS SPOILERS!
","WARNING: There be spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>This film wasn't terrible, but it wasn't, by any stretch of the imagination, good.<br/><br/>I'll start with the good, however... the cast (especially Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, and Angelina Jolie) were quite good. I don't think I've actually ever seen Angelina is a role that allows her to act, as opposed to just toting really big guns. And as for Colin, he steps up to the hero role magnificently... I expect to see some good things in the future from him.<br/><br/>Also, the scenic designers and costume designers have outdone themselves. The worlds that we are treated to are so convincing (like the initial shot of Ptolemy's balcony overlooking the harbor) that I was almost convinced that they actually had built these sweeping vistas and filmed them.<br/><br/>Of course, as I have said, I believe that a significantly large group of people are going to dislike this movie, and here's why:<br/><br/><ul><li>Too much exposition! For this first 45 minutes or so we intercut back and forth between Ptolemy and Alexander growing up. Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for a good story, but it is ridiculous to spend so much time showing Alexander's childhood, and then have Ptolemy tell us about some of Alex's great initial battles without even showing so much as 2 minutes of them in a flashback.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie's timeframe. I realize that Oliver Stone is a very unique filmmaker, but I feel this film is not served at all by huge jumps in time during the movie. I know that this film is portraying a man's entire life, so it needs to have gaps in time, but we really don't need to skip forward and then backward and then forward again. I am a big fan of films that are able to convey time changes without having to resort to ""8 years later,"" etc.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Poor cinematography. This movie does nothing unique, and actually takes a step backwards from other movies in the epic vein. The battle sequences are shot on hand-held camera, and are cut so fast it's impossible to tell what's going on. Also, in the main battle in the desert, the fighting kicks up so much dust, we literally cannot see the battle for most of it. The thing is, we (the audience) are supposed see what a great general Alexander was, along with seeing his emotional turmoil. We can't see any strategy due to te editing of the battles. Also on this subject, at the end of the last battle, Alexander is shot by an arrow, and suddenly the entire world is turning red (or, at least, that is what the audience sees). However, whoever made the choice to use this filter should have thought of it while they were filming, as the red filter turns all the blood yellow (and there's a lot of blood), and just adds to the general ridiculousness of the scene. If you're going to use a color filter, you should always adjust the color of the stage ""blood"" so it still shows up crimson in the final print.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The gay portrayal. I am all for gay rights/gay marriage, etc. Three of my best friends are gay. But I think this movie did a strong disservice to the gay population. One of my friends who went to the screening with me is gay, and he was appalled at the melodramatic (soap-opera-ish) feelings of love. For the straight love story, we get Alexander as a passionate animal, growling at Rosario Dawson; yet for the gay story, we get many (waaaay too many) ""meaningful looks"" and dialog that is so melodramatic that it caused unintended laughter in our audience. Yet if it had been handled like Hollywood handles straight romance, it would have been perfectly fine, and in fact, a wonderful addition to this story.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Screenwriter. I have a huge issue with the screenwriter for this movie, and it goes like this: What were you thinking? I expected epic speeches, etc. What I did not expect was how many ""shouting to the crowd"" speeches we would get. It just dragged on... and on....</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Accents. You would think for the reported $175 million budget, Stone could have hired some dialect coaches. There is no excuse for you Macedonians/Greeks to be talking in varied accents of Scottish, English, and Irish, with a little bit of Transylvanian (Thank you, Angelina) on the side.</li></ul><br/><br/>I don't really care what accent they use (I'm not one who has to have perfect historical accuracy, but pick one and keep all your people of the same ethnicity and region using the same one).<br/><br/><ul><li>Length. Someone needs an editor. Seriously. As I said before, much of Anthony Hopkins has to go. I love the man, but a narrator was not necessary for this film, and cutting him could have shortened it by 30 minutes or so, a necessity for a film that just seems to drag on and on. Someone in our audience literally said (to Alexander) ""Die already!"" Yet even after he dies, we have another 15 minutes of useless exposition about who killed him/how he's remembered. Note to Oliver Stone: We don't care. A biographical picture should always end when the person in question dies. It serves no purpose to keep the film going.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Anti-Climatic. This is probably my biggest issue with the film. After the first 45 minutes of exposition, we launch into the 15-20 minute desert battle. Then the troops reach the lavish city of Babylon. Instead of building the story from here, however, Stone makes each battle after this smaller and (in my opinion) less impressive, as well as having a succession of camps and small villages. To me, this entire movie is assembled backwards. You are supposed to build towards a climax, not put one near the beginning, and fall off from there.</li></ul><br/><br/>All-in-all, the acting and lush eye-candy saved this one somewhat for me, but I still think, unfortunately, you will be disappointed when you see the whole film. Overall, this movie gets 1.5/4 stars from me."
"HeatherCrone","Null","1","2","25 November 2004"," Overall, Great
","Well, the movie was called simply, Alexander. I think Stone did a good and interesting representation of a brilliant but damaged man...torn by and between two warring parents. <br/><br/>The Persian war was well done, if a tad long. The aerial shots and tight phalanxes were great; the visuals of Babylon and the plains in general were wonderful. I didn't like the battle scene in India for a whole variety of reasons; and historically that open field wasn't where our hero took the arrow and was carried off on his shield. I'd have liked to see his first battle which is where the army really took to him as a general and leader, leading into an explanation of why they continued to follow him<br/><br/>Some of the dialog which bothered some folks, e.g., ""Hephaistion's Thighs,"" is part of the historical record, not invented by the scriptwriters, and doesn't have anything to do with wrestling.<br/><br/>There was allot of detail that was quite subtle and I think would be missed by those who haven't made a study of Alexander...at Phillips wedding party when the king has one for the road with his boy toy and then tosses him to the grooms who then later kills him; the scene where the army tells Alexander to kiss Bagoas, having finally gotten used to his being around. The triangle of Alexander, Hephastion, & Bagoas. Roxanna is inexplicable, both historically and in the movie; and I'd have liked to see the scene where Alexander married 80 of his officers to Persian women. Also, Hephaistion's death scene and its aftermath was truly shortchanged; but at least Stone didn't avoid it all!<br/><br/>I do agree that the editing was choppy and I think a couple of the flashbacks should have just been in the normal progression of the storyline. I thought the falcon was irritating. <br/><br/>Wow, it was three hours--I wonder how much was cut that might make a second movie and add the missing parts!! Re-edit, re-release, and maybe recast one or two parts.<br/><br/>Still overall a definite thumbs up for me."

I had family members as well as friends go with me to see it, and everyone was disappointed when we walked out. I counted about 15 people who got up and walked out after about 2 hours of the film, it was sooo boring. I know that everyone's life is boring, but this was insane, I felt like I was watching a three hour soap opera about a guy named Alexander who was very gay, to the point of making me sick. You really couldn't tell who was who in the battles, and there definitely weren't enough of them to keep the movie flowing. The narrator drove me to the point that I wanted someone to run in and kill him in the end too...he went on and on and on. The crowd also erupted into laughter several times because of some of the terrible mistakes this movie made. They would go from a very very serious scene to instant laughter with some guy dancing and making funny faces. Terrible.

First of all, I could say, not a bad movie, not the great(est), like Alexandros was, but worth seeing. I liked some Oliver Stone's older movies, but for this one we really needed someone with more guts - let's say maybe Ridley Scott, someone who wouldn't let his scenes to be deleted or omitted. Then, I have to critique some other things, and good comments will follow, I promise. Hollywood is going into the wrong direction. Yes, they are scared to show male-to-male love, like that is something unknown to human kind - well, maybe to Roman Catholic church mainstream, but apparently not for Ancient Greece. The homosexual scenes were ,actually, shown pretty tastefully, maybe for an PG-13 movie, but not what I would expect from rated R. And yes, it is OK to show a lust between two men, but when we come to the true love - no, no - a big no, no - ridiculous! It is just a love! What are we all afraid of! That wasn't me being original, just a quote. Also, I expected more metaphysical stuff in it, after all he (Alexander) was a Aristotle's pupil (Aristotle started it, I mean metaphysics) - but I just got some epic saga, butchered at the moments, not very well directed! OK, good, things, as I promised. Battles - very well done, and not going forever with exhausting flickering - at the end no one knows what is going on. Not very many of them, so great, great, great! The hawk - excellent symbol!!!! Not going to comment on meaning - I guess that is all individual.

","I just got back from viewing this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. After the swamp of negative ratings and publicity, I decided to drive them to the back of my mind and go in with meager expectations. Luckily Oliver Stone managed to keep me in his ancient world.<br/><br/>First off, the sets and costume design were positively astounding. Babylon, though for the most part CG, was the most impressive ancient city brought to life, period. The armor and ancient clothes were lush and vibrant, with brilliant use of coloring and art.<br/><br/>The acting was great all around, especially Farrell's performance which surprised me most of all. He gave Alexander's character power and vulnerability in all the right areas. And for the love of Christ everyone needs to drop the argument over his bisexuality. It's truth, get over it. Stone's handling of it impressed me most, with his tender portrayal between Alexander and Hephaistion impressed me. You don't need graphic sex or tongue dueling to convey love.<br/><br/>Now that I've talked about the positive it's time to shed some light on what keeps this movie from greatness. The battle scenes must be named. Oliver Stone simply didn't do them justice. For all of his historical accuracy, his staging of the Battle of Guagemala was close to incomprehensible. His cutting and shots confuse more than immerse. Often you can't tell who's being killed or who's killing them. Return of the King proved how much energy a CG battle scene could have, yet no movie has been able to replicate it. Alexander's skewing the colors during the battle against King Porus' elephants was disconcerting in the worst way, varnishing what would have been the movie's physical climax.<br/><br/>There are smaller concerns, namely Alexander's editing. The running length has nothing to do with it, I found each scene excepts for both battles to be both immersive and well staged. I felt like I was walking through the streets of Babylon at times, that's how good it was. But even Stone's trademark non-linear style fails him here. For some reason he skips Philip's assassination and then brings it back right after Alexander murders Cleitus.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, as did many among the American audience who viewed it. This movie is definitely not going to be loved by the younger crowd, who's patience is limited to mindless action it seems these days. But too many of the movie's faults keep it from being another Platoon or JFK, or even on par with historical epics like Gladiator or Spartacus.<br/><br/>6/10"
"david525_82","Null","1","2","25 November 2004"," terrible movie
","I thought this movie was absolutely terrible. From a historical perspective the movie was very inaccurate and undermined everything Alexander the Great ever did. The story centered too much on Alexander's homosexuality which in the movie seemed to define everything Alexander the Great was about, of course in reality this was not the case. While it was rumored that Alexander had homosexual tendencies, there was more to the man than that, Oliver Stone seemed to have forgotten he was a conqueror and ruler. Everything in the movie was way over-dramatized; the only good thing in the movie was Val Kilmer's acting which was superb, and while I'm not a fan of Angelina Jolie, her character and Kilmer's were the only realistically portrayed in the whole movie. Bottom line: don't waste your time or money on this movie."

The cinematography throughout the movie is gorgeous, some scenes get a little excessively artistic but they all have their place.<br/><br/>The biggest draw back to Alexander is the score (which was horrible). In my opinion the background score can make or break a movie and no one took this into account during editing and sound production of the movie. <br/><br/>The homosexual undertones add a depth to the movie that i have not seen in any other mainstream film to date. The taboo is an interesting part of Alexander's personality and is added to just the right degree.<br/><br/>JUST GO SEE IT AND Don't LISTEN TO THE STUPID REVIEWS!"

","i love oliver stone's work. he tried, that's about all this one is.... even from the beginning titles, it appears to be a mediocre film. The first 80 minutes are bearable, the next 60 minutes are excruciatingly painful, and confusing. The last 40 minutes... well, better than the middle 60.<br/><br/>I thought the film would at least be somewhat homoerotic, and it even was a let down in that department. Jared Leto and Colin exchange gestures, but not a kiss. There isn't even a lot of chest bearing on either one of their parts. The only thing semi erotic about the film happens to be the mini skirts they wear.<br/><br/>As for the story, it tells parts here and there, but if you can make it out between the random cutaways, then good luck. I do give props for trying though."

","Three hours was WAY too long for this movie. That length is tolerable for certain movies that advance well in plot, but for ""Alexander"", the movie seemed to reach the halfway point and then just dragged ON and ON and ON and ON and ON . . . <br/><br/>I don't know what exactly it was but my attention was drifting throughout the entire movie. I'd be WATCHING it but was not really gaining anything from it. It was captivating at first but that feeling died down after less than a half an hour into it. It seemed really hard to follow the plot - certain things were dragged out too long and others happened too quickly.<br/><br/>It is becoming increasingly more expensive to go to the movies these days and some films just aren't worth $9 a person. Some aren't even worth the $6 Matinée prices. My fiancé won tickets to an advanced screening of this on the radio, so luckily the only thing that was wasted was our time rather than our money, too. Wait, that's not even true, we bought snacks . . . THIS MOVIE WAS A WASTE OF POPCORN, TOO! :("

","I simply cannot believe all the negativity towards this movie on this site. I recently got back from a screening, and have been captivated ever since I left the auditorium. I think when the movie is released there will be tons of critics applauding Stone and the amazing cast, as well as more user-friendly comments. Simply put, the is a crowning achievement for Stone. Finally we as an audience get an epic historical slice of life that isn't cheasy or tainted with. And the performances are nothing short of perfect. Especially the performance on Angelina Jolie, who steals every scene away from her amazing co-stars. I can definitely see this role garnering her some more awards. Farrel was also great in the film, and it is nice to see that he has such range. Although Hopkins was a little underused, he is always wonderful. And Val Kilmer finally does something worthwhile in this film, he was truly in rare form. Leto, Rhys Meyers, Dawson, etc. all proved that they had the chops to perform along A-list stars. This movie is getting a bad wrap on this website and I do not like it. Like 80% of all the professional reviews I have read are either positive or complete raves. This is something special, and don't let these people on this board tell you otherwise. When it is released majorly across the country, go and see it for yourself, you won't be disappointed."

","I saw this movie too in a not-so-private screening in New York. Colin Farrell was fantastic! And Angelina too! The sets were amazing, and I've never seen anything like the elephant battle scenes on screen before. There's a bit too much blood in a few scenes, but other than that I thought the action was great.<br/><br/>Instead of the usual crap that we're subject to Alexander makes you think about the world and how it got this way. I mean, parts of the action in the movie deal with Alexander's battles in what is now known as Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, India. It could not be more timely.<br/><br/>I am not sure what movie you saw but I'd see this one again."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","8","3","12","12 June 2006"," Good and wide-sweeping epic
","A look into the life of one of history's greatest figures. From young boy and student to young man and world conqueror with everything in between.<br/><br/>Unfairly bashed, even before its release, due politics over sexuality among others and then bashed, once again, during its theatrical run by an action blockbuster hungry audience. I guess Ridley Scott's Gladiator and Wolfgang Peterson's Troy have set the end-all blueprint for prehistorical epics. Those films weren't bad at all, but they were much simpler and conventional than Alexander. The heroes in those movies were strong men doing what strong men in the ancient world did: kick ass. Achilles was a warrior, General Maximus was a warrior, but Alexander wasn't just a warrior. He was a reformer/politician, a lover, a drunkard, and all sorts of other things in addition. Granted that General Maximus was also more than just a soldier, the film Gladiator doesn't present him as much more. Well there is a bit of husband/father in there and the vengeance motive.<br/><br/>The point is that with Alexander, Oliver Stone has tried to take a mighty historical figure and show as many sides of him as possible while staying true to historical context. That resulted in something unlike what most people expected. The supposedly ""dumb gay scenes,"" as I have heard them called, are not dumb at all. It is very easy to see that the film takes place in a different world and there were different societal standards and acceptances. In reading even parts of The Illiad you can see that Troy, while a well produced adaptation, is actually not that great. It is summer blockbuster that is entertaining, but very very deviated from the source material to fit today's standards and acceptances. Alexander isn't a film to try to ""fit in"" and sweep the box office with huge ticket sales, but it presents much more closely from the history books and that makes it much more of a thinking man's movie. Before seeing this movie, you have to open your mind more so than you think is necessary.<br/><br/>Sure there are annoyances here and there, most notably Angelina Jolie's accent - why is she the only one with it? But it isn't that important, many movies have much bigger errors that are written off with ""Hey, it's just for fun."" And that's OK in most movies, but this film isn't just for fun. Looking at Oliver Stone's filmography that shouldn't come as a surprise that he isn't the type to make ""just for fun"" movies. He tries to present situations and people from a thought out and true perspective without doses of eye candy and/or money shots.<br/><br/>In the end, this isn't a stellar film that will go down in history all by itself, but rather a good addition to Stone's body of work. It is with that, that this film will be remembered by. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R: violence"
"jwalzer5","10","3","12","14 November 2005"," Unwarranted criticism
","I am not a big fan of Oliver Stone, but I think, ""Alexander"" has gotten a very bad rap. I thought, ""Platoon"" was great, but ""Born on the Fourth of July"" sucked. Nevertheless, ""Alexander"" was visually stunning and I think it's detractors are more motivated by homophobia than concern for artistic excellence. Alexander's love for Hephastion was beautiful and should be celebrated not deprecated. The film's critics should take a good long long in the mirror. Alexander was one of the the greatest Kings the Western World has ever known. He deserves better from his critics than the kind of cheap polemics to which he has been subjected. The world certainly deserves better."

I'm currently in the U.S. and me and cousins went to watch Alexander at the Dollar Cinema. Let me tell you if I could get that dollar back I would!!! First of all everyone knows Alexander was a bisexual and this movie made sure that everyone knew and didn't forget that. There were maybe one or two historically accurate events in the movie, they used accurate names and characters(unfortunately) and that's about it on the positive side. There are too many negatives to list. ""TOO MANY"". We actually walked out of the theatre midway through the movie laughing for the fact that the movie was supposedly made from Alexander the GREAT's profile. THIS MOVIE IS A SHAME AND A JOKE TO ALL THE MAKEDONES AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ALEXANDER'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS!!! OLIVER STONE WAS STONED WHEN HE MADE THE FILM AND SHOULD BE STONED TO DEATH FOR EVER RELEASING THIS MOVIE TO THE Public!!!(I'M JUST KIDDING ON THE STONED TO DEATH PART) OH AND BY THE WAY I'M NOT A FANATIC!!!

"Pit57","2","2","7","27 December 2004"," Robbed of three precious hours
","The longest 3 hours I've ever spent. This is certainly the worst movie I've seen all year. Everything about it is wrong. From the worn out sit-down-and-i'll-tell-you-about-a-great-man-format, to the corny and completely inaccurate set, to the tiresome and oblivious dialog. Worst of all was the acting. Without a doubt the most unconvincing acting performance of the new millennium. Anthony Hopkins looks and sounds like an old drunk fart moaning about his youth, instead of a great general and pharaoh. Angelina Jolie sounds like a KGB spy and makes her character behave like something out of a Voodoo cult. But when it comes to pathetic performances, Colin Farrel steals the show. The way he manages to make even his best lines, and these are few and far between, sound like the insecure dribble of an adolescent high school dropout is impressive. Not for a moment is he convincing in his passion for Hephaistion, which he wails on about through half the film. But worse yet, no one could possibly believe him to be the leader who inspired tens of thousands of simple Macedonian soldiers to march with him for years to the edge, and beyond, the known world. He acts more like he couldn't inspire a dog to lift it's leg. But the biggest mystery about this 180 minute farce is surely the choice to have the Macedonians speak with an Irish accent. WHY?!!? What was he thinking? Having ruthless iron-clad conquerors sounding like they've just stepped out of a Guinness commercial has to the biggest error in modern cinematography. And, in the case of Farrel, a bad Irish accent at that. Complete Bo**ocks! <br/><br/>Mr. Stone, I want my three hours back."
"dreighruhtra","10","2","7","25 November 2004"," Brilliant
","Considering the enormous life that Stone and his people had to tackle and portray with this film, I can hail them in doing an absolutely brilliant job. Obviously, Stone had to cut out and leave out a large amount, which might lead to some confusion concerning the story for those that sadly enough are not educated enough to know and accept the life of one of the greatest men that has ever lived. But Oliver Stone did a sincere job to try to portray this man who has inspired so many throughout the centuries (now millennia). <br/><br/>Also, I'd like to add, despite the negative reviews, especially about the acting (even in the new york times), that have been made for this film, the only way to really understand the story is by studying it thoroughly. BUT, watching this film is a well worth short cut. I think that the performances were brilliant. Especially that of Colin Farrell, who portrayed Alexander, with all his youthful vigour and emotional complexity, marvelously. Although I got that he really worked his best to understand and love Alexander just by seeing him in the film, his interview (alongside Oliver Stone and Angelina Jolie) with Charlie Rose on PBS fully convinced me. Farrell became Alexander. <br/><br/>Stone and Farrell (and the rest of the crew) have given back to us the magic of greatness that can so easily be lost in this modern commercially driven society (which has dire effects on our level/intensity of education among other things). Alexander can inspire us to achieve greatness once again."
"mysacredpath","10","2","7","20 November 2004"," Fascinating
","Tastes can differ, maybe more than ever when ground breaking directors like Oliver Stone get the chance to work on something as big and ambitious as ""Alexander"". There's been a certain buzz on the internet, and in certain circles, that the movie would not live up to its expectations. It would be a mess or even boring. This may be true for some. It very well is not for others. In the end, it will be for everyone to decide personally.<br/><br/>If I may offer my personal view, I can only say that it was totally fascinating for me. Where one might expect a heroic account of history's most charismatic leader, Stone fiercefully explores the shadowy sides of Alexander's past. His unfulfilled dreams rather than his conquests. His doubts and anxieties, even his failures rather than his flawless successes. Maybe this creates a more intellectual rather than heartfelt approach, and perhaps this disappoints those who were looking for a feel-good rant about heroism and leadership. But this could very well be more true to reality and it certainly leaves more fascinating thoughts to play with, long after the movie has ended. <br/><br/>Although I can see some of the flaws here and there, the overwhelming impression is of its scale, its complexity, the bravery of making the film like no one expected. The story sometimes tells one thing, but shows another, leaving doubt and personal interpretation to the viewer. There are no good guys, there are no bad guys. No heroes or villains. No pure victory and no pure defeat. <br/><br/>The production quality - and the way this works out in the movie - is immense. The battle scenes left me gasping for breath. Even at its slightly boring moments - there are some parts where the story starts to drag a bit - the film would still impress with picture perfect visuals, set designs and music. I could not do anything but be swayed by it. <br/><br/>As for its critics, I'd say the movie is perhaps simply too European to be appreciated in Hollywood. Too dark and too theatrical, at least compared to what people expected. American critics may hate it, or they may still love it. In the end, they do not have the final say. History showed, with films like Blade Runner, that if they are powerful enough, a devoted audience can keep them alive and as false expectations fade in time, naturally propel them to their rightful place in cinematic history. Watch for homage as well as parody, in the years to come. And see it for yourself, in the biggest theater you can find."
"Enrique-Sanchez-56","10","3","13","24 November 2005"," Magnificent Achievement
","Most people will not agree with me or this review. But I defend it only because it is only my opinion. You can chose to agree or disagree but I will not disavow it merely to save face because I believe it through and through.<br/><br/>As much as I despise Stone's personal politics, with a passion that I cannot fully explain here, I must separate my disdain for his life from his work on this film as I regularly separate my disgust for the person of Richard Wagner from the glory of his grand and timeless music.<br/><br/>There is much to laud in this film which has been derided so much.<br/><br/>It has images and moments that will stay with me for a long time.<br/><br/>The imagery alone in the last battle in India should have permitted this film to join the ranks of the greatest movies. It reminds of that great battle in Kurosawa's RAN. Full of poetry, pathos, light and color.<br/><br/>The music of Vangelis must be heavily praised here for its amazing power and beauty. A finer score has not often been heard without instantly recognizable ""tunes and catchy songs"" which is so much in vogue today in ""Hollywood"". Vangelis did not resort to this until the movie was over and we were treated to two very finely spun melodies during the final credits. Let's not confuse the music when young Alexander subdues his horse as a melody, that, my friends, was orchestration of the highest caliber.<br/><br/>For these and other virtues in this film, the general populace failed to recognize this greatness. They could not see a movie that moved differently from they had been accustomed to and called it ""good"". That is the great failing of art in these times. We have been fed so much tripe that we have come to hunger and thirst for it, not knowing that there are other ways, better ways, to approach the film medium.<br/><br/>Take those criticisms of Farrell's performance. If any performance has moved me in the past few years, it has been his. At times his conviction and ferocity in this role was a sheer pleasure to behold. The power of Farrell's sensitivity brought me into his world and to the world that we might imagine that Alexander lived and suffered.<br/><br/>Hopkins was the perfect narrator, Jolie was deliciously imposing as the cold, power-lusting mother of Alexander. Fine too were Val Kilmer as Alexander's father, and Jared Leto, Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Joseph Morgan<br/><br/>To compare this movie to recent historic epics is tantamount to a treason to our generation's legacies. They have called this movie of Stone's a failure. To paraphrase Hopkins' speech at the end of the movie: ""What failure? His failure towers over other men's successes!"" How could one even compare this to BRAVEHEART, TROY or GLADIATOR? They were all wrought with a heavy hand and a predictable, mass-marketed touch. (I remove the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy from this comparison because this series is in a class all its own.) But perhaps the most important reason that Stone's movie did not seem palatable to the masses was the obvious mainstream disdain for same-sex love. In this age of more sexual freedom than has been seen in hundreds of years, it is ironic that such truths that Greek society was different from ours in their acceptances of sexuality, should have relegated this movie to the ranks of curiosity and banal criticism and not the popular success which it deserves.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie before, I entreat you to experience it. It is not art-house by far. But it will move you into a place you may have seldom seen or heard."
"Berberis","9","3","13","11 August 2005"," Gotta love that man...
","Despite the reviews, I recently bought the 'as seen in the cinema' version of Oliver Stone's 'Alexander'.<br/><br/>Um... I liked it. Can I say that? Doesn't matter... I've said it anyway, and I'll say it again, just in case no one believed me the first time: I liked it. At this point, I should perhaps mention that the opinions of 'critics' are not necessarily a guarantee of movie excellence. Witness 'Big Fish', which was loved by the critics. I gave up after about 30 minutes, knowing that there was something *much* better I could be doing...<br/><br/>The same goes for 'The Exorcist', 'Last Tango In Paris' and 'A Clockwork Orange'... in *my* opinion, which is, of course, as valid as Barry Norman's or Mark Kermode's. Well, isn't it...? You see, this is *precisely* why reviewing a film is such a problem. *I* love it. *You* hate it. Unless it's 'Toy Story' or 'It's A Wonderful Life'. So, to the matter in hand: Alexander III of Macedon, as seen through the eyes of Oliver Stone. Man or myth? Stone? Man. Alexander. Well, both... and probably mad to boot. *Anyone* with that much power and influence cannot *but* be a little touched come the end... however premature that end may be.<br/><br/>I recently read Mary Renault's 'Alexander' trilogy (is it disrespectful to refer to him as 'Alex'?), largely because of the brouhaha surrounding the film. A notable Alexander expert, Robin Lane Fox, was retained by Stone for the film, and I will definitely be reading *his* book at some point this year, as well as the biog by Peter Green. Like you care. Okay, I'm meant to be reviewing this film. So... I loved Colin Farrell's Alexander. I loved Jared Leto's Hephaestion. I loved the affection between them, as subtle as it was. <br/><br/>(At this point, a question: for goodness sake, why?? For a handful of meaningful looks, a caress, and two or three hugs Stone recut this film??) <br/><br/>Colin Farrell was, in my opinion, perfectly cast. I was reminded of Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart in 'Amadeus' as I watched Alexander's decline from wide-eyed wanna-be-conqueror of all he surveyed to shambling and drunken megalomaniac. I ended up believing that here was a man who could quite easily ramble on about conquering the whole world whilst Hephaestion (arguably the love of his life) was dying in agony of typhus in the same room.<br/><br/>And - by the blood of Aphrodite! - did I want to smack him. I wanted him to realise *much* earlier that his mother was a manipulative bitch. I wanted him to realise *much* earlier that his father was a drunken bully. And I wanted (how *desperately* I wanted) Hephaestion to tell Alexander he *loved* him, so that, even as deluded as he was, the King of Almost Everywhere At That Time would, perhaps, calm down a bit. <br/><br/>And what was not to love? Alexander was clever, sensitive, brave, and gorgeous. And he even smelled nice, apparently. And he was *nothing* if not an 'all or nothing' man. He wanted it all, and he wanted it NOW, and it was a brave man/woman or a fool who got in his way. Gotta love that about a man... Until even *he* starts to believe the myth. Power corrupts... and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Alexander *knew* this, but was seemingly unable to prevent it happening to him. He may well have been benevolent to those he captured and magnanimous in victory, but he was a man, and therefore was governed by the need to win. And, to his credit, he *did* win. He won every battle in which he fought except, and please forgive me the cliché, the battle with himself.<br/><br/>'A flame that burns too bright is soon burned out...' In wanting to please his mother, and being desperate to live up to his father's expectations of him, Alexander was burned out at 32. The beginning of the end is surely Hephaestion's death. By all accounts, Alexander was utterly devastated by this event so why (when all the documentary evidence says he *did*) does Oliver Stone not have the grief-stricken King hack off his hair? <br/><br/>The next thing we see is Alexander downing a quart (at least) of wine, having hallucinated his mother as Medusa before collapsing, his own demise following shortly afterwards. And, you know, I couldn't help but feel really sorry for him at the end. There must have been so much more he wanted to do but he was young (even in an age when 40 was elderly) and he was headstrong and naive and clearly didn't think beyond the next battle. He didn't make a will. He didn't have any final words ready for a scribe to take down. It is a measure of the ferocious nature of his life that his death was something he simply didn't prepare for. I don't actually think Alexander *expected* to die. But he did, in the way that James Dean and Marilyn Monroe and Buddy Holly died; violently, and much too soon.<br/><br/>Had he lived, Alexander the Great might have been the worst kind of tyrannical despot, responsible for the destruction of as many civilisations as he liberated. Instead, having 'pushed the envelope', journeyed to the edge of the known world, having seen what no man had seen before, he died young, and not peacefully. Of such events are heroes made...<br/><br/>Passionate, impulsive, stubborn... Alexander is a paradox. If Man lives this way, he risks death. But if not, has he lived at all..? There may well be omissions and errors in this film but that is the nature of films; you cannot include *everything*, no matter how much you might want to. There are, as this film shows all too clearly, limits to human endurance. Oliver Stone clearly admires Alexander the Great. Having seen this film, I admire them both."

","Days after the movie, I am still under the spell. An epic, indeed.<br/><br/>It is a modest overview of Alexander the Great. The movie is not an absolute reflection of history, but MOST of it is. Oliver has tried his best not to compromise the artistic sense at the cost of sticking obstinately to the history.<br/><br/>Some were disturbed by the ambiguous relationship between Hephaestion and Alexander, as well as that between Olympias(mother) and Alexander. However, many facts and a lot of evidence have hinted this. But these don't make Alexander less than what he is. <br/><br/>The actors are good. Colin is very fine, gentle and bold at the same time. Jared Leto (Haphaestion) is particularly eye-catching, the way he looked at Alexander with tears in his eyes, and the way he handed the ring to Alexander with Roxane standing behind out of blue, and the way he passed away. This is the movie that truly convinces me 'true love exists in any form'.<br/><br/>The music is deeply moving, composed by Vangelis. Please do not miss the great soundtrack by Vangelis, esp. Track 13 - Across the Mountains, where Alexander faced the Hindu Kush. and Track 18 - Tender Memeory.<br/><br/>Definitely a much better movie than what the critics say. For those who don't favor it or think it is excessively long, is it possible that History as a subject bores you in school as well?"

","Oliver Stone's is famous for getting a wide gap of mixed reviews. Alexander is no different. Either you HATE it or you absolutely LOVE it. I LOVED this movie. Alexander is not the typical, battle every ten minute movie. Stone is able to take this historical figure and put his whole life into just three hours. Many people are saying that this movie is too long, but Stone makes sure every important thing is put into it and thats what makes it even more great. Yes, there are excellent battle especially the battle in the jungle involving a elephant. But the concept of this movie is not how much blood is shed, but how Alexander lived his life. Collin Farell is awesome as Alexander, no one could play him better. However, its Angelina Jolie who steals this movie. Her portrayal of Olympias is right on the money. Olympias was a evil, manipulative, backstabbing women and Jolie is perfect in this role. Yes she does speak with a translyvanian accent because thats the region she is from. Everything in this movie is wonderful and amazing. A lot of people are not going to like it because they will think its boring. Like every Oliver Stone movie, you either LOVE it or you HATE it."

","I think the real problem is that you have to actually ""think"" about this film. It doesn't draw the conclusions for you, it makes you draw them, for yourself. I think that is where one of the problems lie. Some people don't want to have to draw their own conclusions. They want to have their cake and eat it too. This film doesn't give you both. Apparently, it doesn't spell it out for everyone. I think people go to a film and would prefer that it be spelled out for them (in some cases). <br/><br/>I guess Stone is famous for this type of thing. Thats why many like his films and many don't, depending how you look at it. But like I said, Stone may have made it complicated, as well. What might be his vision for the film, may not be interpreted the same by others watching it.<br/><br/>Apparently, from someone who liked Alexander and just saw it, the film is heavy in symbolism. Maybe that's why people who have seen it (here I mean moviegoers and not the critics) don't like it. It's making them think and work for the film, instead of spelling things out clearly for them. And it isn't heavy on action, which they were obviously expecting in a biopic about Alexander."

Usually these criteria's has given him success and acknowledgement, but everything has its end. Alexander was in long look upon as the movie of the year. But the audience and reviewers gave it thumbs down, very fast. But is the movie really a thumb down movie? I say no. I can see why some might not like this movie. Its gives a quite gay view on some of the leading characters, and has some very long, maybe to long passages, the movie through out. And the acting, from some persons, really isn't that great. Alexander has its flaws and is controversial, due to its relaxed vision on gay relationships. But the real Alexander was like this. History has shown it. The director wished to make this movie as real as possible, even though it meant bringing this controversial vision of his main character. Actually a really known Scandinavian History magazine gave it 6 out of 6 stars, comparing the movie to the real actual Historical events.<br/><br/>The story deals with Alexander's war expedition through the whole known world. It begins with a narrator, and is told in flashback, from one of the involved characters. We first meat Alexander at a very young age, and thereafter he grows, and his intrigues with mother, father and other involved parties are introduced. From that point on, we follow Alexander the Great  and his conquest of the world.<br/><br/>The best acting performance in the movie comes from Val Kilmer, who under at lot of make up, gives a great performance as Alexander's father. Colin Farrell gives an almost likewise great performance, in this very difficult role. Jared Leto is good, but a bit too anonymous in the supporting role of Alexander's best friend, Hephaistion. Anthony Hopkins delivers another good piece of craftsmanship as the narrator, but otherwise nobody stands out of the crowd.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is stunning. An almost perfect atmosphere is given of the world with the excellent costumes, great art-set decoration, and a beautifully rough cinematography makes it look even better. Vangelis delivers another excellent score, of the best of 2004, and both the visual- and sound effects are great! <br/><br/>Oliver Stone has made a daring, mature and brave historical epic! Thumbs Up! <br/><br/>8/10"

","Last night i went to see Alexander although the grade it was given here at IMDb was disappointing to say the least. i have been looking forward to this movie ever since i saw the names oliver stone and his cast, and after seeing the trailer i was convinced this would be a great movie! So i went to the cinema and i was stunned, how could this movie get such a low rating when it should have gotten a high mark instead! The beginning of the story we can see some nice acting from val kilmer and jolie as parents to young Alexander,.. the struggle in his family is clear and very nice shot by stone. we see jolie as the strange woman who plays the mysterious mother and the hard val kilmer as the ""tutuous"" father.. after that we see Alexander becoming the man he always wanted to be, perfect acting by colin farrel.. the battles in this movie are quite different from what we have seen before, we actually see tactics instead of 15000 people running into each other! the combat is chaotic but on the larger scale organized!<br/><br/>The biggest downfall for this movie probably is that many people found it too long and too gay.. well i had no problems with either and can honestly say that this movie is truly a great movie!"

","Like a lot of other people, I have heard terrible comments about this film. I never listen to the critics and I'm glad I didn't. This was a fantastic film! I was a bit skeptical thanks to the critics bashing it so badly, but wasn't completely put off and after seeing the trailer, I knew I had to see.<br/><br/>I don't care much for Gladiator. I found it extremely boring, the acting was terrible (apart from Joaquin Phoenix) and it was so overrated. Troy was a fantastic film too, but I definitely know I like this one better.<br/><br/>It really bugs me when these big shot Hollywood writers and directors mess with history and change it to suit their script but this wasn't done with this film.<br/><br/>The acting was incredible. I'm not a huge fan of Colin Farrell. I mean I don't hate him or anything he's just not my favourite but his performance in Alexander was spectacular. I really didn't think he had it in him to play such a character, but he pulled it off. Angelina Jolie was also great in her role since she usually is in most of her roles and me being a long time fan of Val Kilmer, it's nice to see him in a different type of role and, ahem, different appearance. The supporting cast did a great job too aside from Anthony Hopkins which I never thought was spectacular in any of his roles (yes, including Hannibal Lectur).<br/><br/>The length of the film nearly tops 3 hours but I mean who cares? I hate hearing people (mainly critics again) complain that a film is too long. Would they rather important things be left out of the film, just to give them something else to complain about? There were even things in the film that weren't included. That's how much history there is in this epic! I mean you pay $9 for a movie ticket so would you rather pay it for some 80 minute movie that's not worth your money or for a fantastic, long movie that's definitely worth the price? If you still don't believe this film is worth seeing, please check out everyone else's comments and NEVER EVER EVER listen to the critics. They must get paid more to say bad things about films.<br/><br/>This film is a must see movie for all ages and whatever genre you like, this movie will still be for you. You won't regret it. There weren't many people in the theatre when I saw it. I'm 17 and I went with my mum. The rest of the audience were elderly people.<br/><br/>Since this movie didn't do very well at the box office, hopefully it will make back the money from DVD rentals & sales.<br/><br/>A true epic! 10/10"
"timeea","Null","2","9","18 January 2005"," what people do for fame!
","I must say I didn't know I liked Troy until I saw ""Alexander"". First of all Colin Farrel didn't seem to be like the appropriate guy for this character. He didn't look like you could admire him. he was not great. they should have chose someone else instead of him. Second of all, I hate what American directors do to history in order to gain money. They distort history a little, they put grand special effects (because they have the money!!!, they put stars like naughty boy Farrel+Jolie, fashion and hair-does, modern blah-blah conversations. To me nothing was real. I can't see through it (maybe because there is nothing to be seen). and another thing. It was really stupid when Farrel and Leto said stuff like I don't want to live without you, or Your eyes are beautiful. everybody in the cinema laughed and made jokes. I guess they didn't seem convincing and even more they looked like two stupid people. What people do for fame. I pity them!!"
"nevoy","8","2","9","8 December 2004"," Worth seeing! (And FAR better than Troy ...)
","I am not an expert on Alexander or his time period, which definitely helped me to enjoy the movie, as I was not approaching it with strongly-held opinions on what should or should not be said, or how they should depict the characters.<br/><br/>On the whole, I enjoyed the film -- a lot more than I had thought I would, especially from seeing the trailers for it, which made it look a great deal cheesier than it actually was.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the acting; I thought Colin really was very good, and on the whole the various characters seemed to be real people, unlike in ""Troy"" in which they are moving cardboard cutouts. It was splendid to see Alexander and Hephaiston's relationship treated as something which could actually be talked about and made part of the film without having to conceal it or have it only be talked about by fan fiction writers! (Nothing wrong with fanatic, I do it myself -- it's just nice to see such a relationship actually acknowledged in the film itself!) I agree with various other revisers that it would have been nice to see A. & H. actually kiss, and the smoldering slave boy was a bit annoying, how he always stood around hotly brooding -- but on the whole, it was awesome to see a protagonist who can be gay or bi without it detracting from his heroism.<br/><br/>I skimmed through an Encyclopedia Britannica article on Alexander after seeing the film, and saw there several incidents in his life that it seems would have been better included in the film than some of those that were included. I think it really would have been awesome to include the sequence where he goes to the site of Troy, makes sacrifices at the shrines of the Homeric heroes there, and takes what was supposedly Achilles's shield. I know they referred several times to his interest in Achilles & the Homeric legends, but I think that sequence of him going to Troy would have really given that element a lot more impact. And I definitely think there should have been more treatment given to what Phillip (Alexander's father)'s goals and dreams of conquest were, since they kept making the point that Alexander's dreams and goals were different from his father's.<br/><br/>It also would have helped a lot, I think, to know more about what his followers, particularly the officers who were with him from the beginning, thought about the whole thing -- what they thought they were doing, what their goals were, why they were following Alexander. I would have liked to know why Hephaiston was there, too, in his mind -- whether he just went along because he loved Alexander, or whether he had his own dreams about Hellenistic domination or conquering the Persians or exploring beyond the borders of the known world, or what.<br/><br/>All that said, yes, there were lots of things that I think could have been done better or more insightfully, but on the other hand, it was excellently watchable, and actually had intelligence and ambivalence and subtleties, unlike most of these epics. I'm very glad I saw it. (I do wish we'd seen more of Alexander and Hephaiston, but hey, we can't have everything!)"
"logindima","9","2","9","13 December 2004"," Maybe not greatest, but a very good movie.
","(First of all, I am sorry for my English)<br/><br/>I think that this movie is quite underestimated..<br/><br/>I think that Oliver Stone made this movie not as an epic fresco of Alexander's life day by day. For me, the point of this film was stated early in the beginning: greatness always comes along with a failure. And he succeeded in this task of showing a tragedy of a man that was called great and which came to the failure of his greatness.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I could abstract really important (for me) points of this movie from Alexander being gay etc., what was the main topic on various forums. I am asking myself: if, instead of Jared Leto and various other men, Alexander in this movie slept with women and felt deeply in love with a woman, could this bring up so many commentaries? I think not.<br/><br/>Battle scenes in this movie (I think) are shown with as little glamour and glory as it is in the real life, where battles are more like collective madness to me, whatever the purpose of the war is. I liked this. It is not Lord of the Rings after all. Blood is blood here.<br/><br/>However, I think, there are some shortcomings. Colin Farrel in some scenes is too infantile and unconvincing (all scenes with him and his mother);<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie, apart of being quite a witch here, is non-natural for her character to be convincing.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that this movie is not as great as I wanted it to be, but definitely worth second and third watch and I am going to buy DVD as soon as it is released.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."
"harpreetc","10","2","9","8 December 2004"," Nearly as awesome as Alexander.
","Ever since I read ""The Persian Boy"" in my teens, I have had an incomparable feeling for Alexander. There was this insatiable need to know all there was to know about Alexander, the Great. Renault did his life justice when she wrote about him in her trilogy ... and after seeing Stone's movie, I believe that he, too, has done his very best in being faithful to the character of one of the greatest of men who ever lived!<br/><br/>I think that each character in the movie was very well cast! Jolie was a brilliant Olympias, Kilmer WAS Philip!!! Frankly, Farell would not have been my first choice as Alexander, but he carries off the role with a great deal of responsibility - and a flair that can be seen in -not all but - some scenes. Like the scene with his mother after the assassination of his father! It is a well-grafted scene - but Jolie has outdone herself!<br/><br/>Stone has used a lot of salient facts within the movie and THANKFULLY, Alexander's love for Hephaistion has been depicted as it truly was in the annals of history! Unlike the hideous distortion of the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus in Troy, the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion retains its originality! Stone has shown his utter conviction to keep with the truth of history and even shown the relationship between Alexander and his Persian slave, Bogoas. The topic of which was the central theme in Renault's ""The Persian Boy"". <br/><br/>Troy seems like a complete farce when compared to this movie!<br/><br/>The plot moves at a steady pace and Stone knows just what factors should be engaged in the depiction of the biographical sketch and what factors should be left out. The story of how he tamed the beautiful and spirited Bucephalus, a horse that no one dared to touch or ride is skillfully shown as well as the fact of how this famous steed carried him as far as India, where it died! And then again, his sacking of Thebes has been neglected in the storyline. <br/><br/>His annexation of Persia and the battle of Arbela - also known as the battle of Gaugamela - is the highlight of the movie. Though I was saddened about the exclusion of his victory over Tyre which is considered to be his greatest military achievement.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this genre of biographical moviedom caters to the valor and the zeal portrayed by one of the greatest heros that ever lived, there is the infusion of a softness, of aspects of love and of devotion. There is the love between Hephaistion and Alexander, the devotion of Bogoas towards Alexander, and the love-hate relationship between Roxane and Alexander! <br/><br/>As I saw the final scenes of Alexander hallucinating in the final stages of malaria, his anguish bound to the ring Hephaistion had given him, I mentally saluted Oliver Stone for creating this movie. For years I have wondered what a movie on Alexander would be like - if it would retain the truth of who and what the man behind the warrior was - and frankly I am very glad that Stone's vision was not too far from mine. I highly recommend this movie to all those who want to know what sort of a person Alexander was - for this is a faithful description. <br/><br/>Hats off to you, Mr Stone!"

","Perhaps I went and saw a different movie? I really enjoyed it. It was an epic in every sense of the word, an epic tale of Greek Tragedy - in its original sense. A story of a great man who is destine for greatness and the price that it carried -- loneliness, betrayal, isolation, paranoia, and ultimately, death and destruction of a dream that only he could have carried forward.<br/><br/>I was especially impressed with the historical accuracy of the portrayal of Alexander and his deeds. The story pulled no punches about the fact of his bisexuality and perhaps I think this is partially why so many people, expecting to see super-macho alpha male persona like Mel Gibson's Bravheart, are disquieted with this truthful depiction of hellenistic view with regard to sexuality. The story did stay true to the ""history"" as passed down from Callisthenes and Ptolemy I - as truthful of an adaptation as I have seen in recent Hollywood films anyway. None of the Patroclus was Achilles' cousin or battle of Stirling Bridge without a bridge in sight business :)<br/><br/>It was an epic made for serious viewers, which may have required a college course in the hellenistic world to truly appreciate.<br/><br/>One minor gripe. I thought the movie would have been better if it was told in a purely linear fashion. But who am I to argue with Oliver Stone"

I'm still uncertain about her accent, but she stole every scene. Colin Farrel is also very good and I do expect an Oscar nomination going toward Farrel and definitely Jolie. The battle scenes are great, far better then Troy. And no way is this a another Troy, Troy had a confusing and unhistorical story.

"johnnyboyz","4","1","3","20 December 2011"," Strenuous and generally difficult to stay alert to, this opus on Alexander the Great is anything but its eponymous lead's nickname.
","Like Costner's lead in 1991's JFK; Barry Champlain from the earlier Talk Radio and then Pacino's lead character further back in 1983's Scarface (whose screen writing credit is the important thing here) Oliver Stone's 2004, centuries-ago set Hollywood romp Alexander covers a male lead with an insatiable desire to conquer; a thirst to break through the boundaries which govern the 'rules' of the established norm so as to make a name for himself against extraordinary odds. They are Stone movies about fiercely competitive, and often fiercely temperamental, people capable of quite extraordinary things within a specific field. Costner wanted to un-Earth the truth about a killing; Champlain took on a sordid, invincible God-like figure whom constantly pushed the envelope when his radio show went national, and Pacino's Tony Montanna decided to run the Miami narcotics trade single handedly. Here, Alexander's eponymous lead, Colin Farrell's Alexander the Great, of around 350 B.C, tries to take on and rule the world – you can't blame a guy for trying'.<br/><br/>The difference between Alexander and what preceded Alexander is that Stone goes on to make a complete hash of it. Here is another Oliver Stone film about a man who just doesn't know when to call it a day; a film driven by man who carries on a hunger for progression long after most guys would've called it a day already – we arrive at the project expecting rather a lot, but come away on this occasion with a frightening sense of numbness and disappointment. Stone has never been the sort of person to necessarily produce ""small"" films, but his Alexander here is what 1984's Dune was to David Lynch; a big and bombastic exercise in stunning vistas, emphasis on genre convention and stars in funny outfits doing its best to try and get across persistent senses of scale. It fails miserably.<br/><br/>The first we see of Alexander is that of a stone model of his head, and a large bird of prey swooping down delicately dissolving into the close up of the would-be statue - the correlation between our titular lead and some sort of predator, some sort of brilliant beast feared in certain circles is alluded to before later confirmed when an edit placing a close up of his eyes with that of another bird of prey's occurs. The film is narrated to us by a man whom stood beside Alexander through his battles, an elderly and bedraggled Ptolemy, who's played by Anthony Hopkins, speaking as warmly as he can about the tribulations and twists of Alexander's life all those decades ago. As a youngster, Alexander lives with a brute of a father, but he's not around for long, as well as his mother, Olympias (Jolie). Jolie plays Olympias as a woman who is all charm; Russian accents and is often clad-in-snake. Alexander sits, with a bunch of other kids his age of whom are speaking in English but with an Irish twang in spite of the fact the whole thing ought be in Greek, or whatever, anyway, and he listens to the great philosophers of the era speak of how the mystery shrouded and dangerous ""East"" are death traps in-waiting for all those whom go anywhere near it. Naturally, Alexander becomes someone gunning to invade it.<br/><br/>Along the way to growing up, he will learn to tame horses; how to take control of situations; become a swordsman and fall in love - all the necessary things, you might say, to instill that he is a warrior in the making. Stone will pound us into the ground during the mid-section of this three hour chore with the repetitive mention of the names of people and places on top of a ton of historical exposition. At the beginning, Hopkins speaks of how Alexander was able to instill great belief and how one was proud to be alongside him; not long into one campaign, in which the land of Persia is conquered despite the fact the one fight we see involving Farrell's forces has them beaten easily, what Hopkins said is totally contradicted when clear distrust and anger at Alexander's leadership within the army rear up.<br/><br/>There is room for our Alex to fall in love, but it will essentially be to one or two of his friends of the male variety more than anyone. In spite of this, Alexander will marry Rosario Dawson's Roxanne. The funniest scene of the film occurs when she accuses him of homosexuality and he attempts to make love to her in reaction, something that is quelled when Dawson turns it into a session of brief face slapping and power-play on the bed involving a knife to her husband's throat. This grip of accusation Roxanne has on him, although drenched in truths, sees Alexander unable to face up to them and can only be nullified when a trinket in the style of a sadomasochistic restraint is removed from one of the two persons so that heterosexual bonding may play out away from the vice like 'hold' of knowing homosexual ties both parties identify exist. A lot is spoken about Wolfgang Peterson's Troy, which came out at around the same time, in regards to Alexander; I liked Troy more – a film which got on with things and at least told a story whilst maintaining a fair amount of this sense of conflict as two sides warred. Alexander is an episodic, one-note and melodramatic lesson in history for anybody unfortunate enough to be roped into it."

","I don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with the Irish accents. They certainly didn't speak English back then anyway, so I think it's kind of presumptuous to assume they should be speaking with a British or an American accent. It makes no sense to me, and I don't think it interfered at all with their great performances and the overall watching experience.<br/><br/>The cast was incredible in my opinion. Jared Leto delivered a very strong performance, Collin Farrell was terrific, Anthony Hopkins was legendary as always. The only terrible casting mistake is Angelina Jolie (who is the reason I avoided watching this Film for so long). Her accent is horrific. I don't know what she was trying to be, she sounded like an evil witch from an unknown continent that spoke an odd mixture of languages. Seriously.

","For me, those who have been negative about this film lack an appreciation of art and understanding of history (I was once like you but have since thankfully been enlightened). If you knew the history of this period then how could you not love this film? It is one o the most faithful biopics ever committed to celluloid and deserves to be praised for the masterpiece that it is. I believe ten years from now Alexander will be appreciated much more and be hailed as a triumph. Even though it took me a few years to acknowledge it, Alexander is without a doubt one of the greatest epics of all time and deserves to be respected. Colin Farrell feels he needs to apologise to anyone he meets in case they've seen the film and went through a massive depression after it flopped as he put his heart and soul in to it (as can be clearly seen). I find this very sad considering it's the greatest performance of his career."

","A movie not recommended for Rambo-blood-war-battle-slasher movie loving Americans and by patriot Greeks and Macedonians (they don't appreciate their national hero being portrayed as a bisexual man, even if he probably was). But a good movie overall (if you overlook the casting and the performance of some of the actors - Jolie, Dawson and Farrell especially). Why the movie works for me: - it's trying to be historically accurate - the battle scenes are awesome (I was getting tired of computer games like 300, Gladiator etc.) - it's not a Jerry Bruckheimer type of movie, where you feel like watching an never ending battle (this is the reason for the film/s poor success in the United States). I liked the movie, but it should have been better. I think it will be considered a classic in 20 years or so."

I watched it later that week and was pretty surprised, overall it was a pretty good movie. Yes it was long and sometimes a little boring, but if you are interested in the story of Alexander or of historical figures it will keep you attention throughout. Colin Farrel does a OK job in the title roll and Val Kilmer is a convincing King Phillip. So I recommend seeing this film, and I recommend going into it to prepare to have the patience through the slow parts, it will be worth it."
"rameses19104-1","8","1","3","1 December 2007"," A breathtaking and positive viewing experience.
","Oliver Stone's Alexander ***1/2 <br/><br/>Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836-1912) was a painter who worked in the latter part of the 19th and early part of the 20th Century. He was unconventional in the sense that he was a representational artist at a time when the art world was wrestling with the groundbreaking efforts of the Impressionist and the Post-Impressionists. His main area of concentration was the ancient world with particular emphasis on Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Experiencing Oliver Stone's Alexander is similar to experiencing an Alma-Tadema exhibit come to life. Immediately the viewer is swept away by the breathtaking landscapes as well as beautiful interiors. Surprisingly the level of visual impact does not lessen but increases throughout the film. At no point does the film deaden the senses through over stimulation. Landscapes of Alexandria and Babylon are just as breathtaking in the third hour as well as the first hour of the film.<br/><br/>Speaking of the performances at no point in the film do the performances deserve any harsh level of scrutiny. Val Kilmer was faced with the strongest challenge in that he portrayed a character engaged in a love/hate relationship with his son engendered by an ambivalent and deadly relationship with his wife played by Angelina Jolie. These irreconcilable differences are eventually resolved through assassination. Kilmer's performance is commendable and consistent with the somewhat sad and touching character that he portrays.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie's performance is as venomous as the snakes that are twined around her body throughout most of the film. Initially the film creates a certain sympathy for the Jolie character as we see her being raped by her rejected husband Philip. Jolie is excellent in portraying the mother using her hatred and poisonous energy to turn Alexander against his father. The scenes with Jolie and all the Alexanders of various ages are replete with force and passion. <br/><br/>Colin Farrell's Alexander is believable and the range of emotions that he is called upon to portray are not limited to histrionic outbursts although there is more than enough of that to go around. He is challenged most as an actor when called upon to portray the Alexander torn between his mother's hatred of his father and his love and admiration of him. He more than meets the challenge.<br/><br/>A word about the battle scenes. Not since Waterloo (1970) has there been such an appreciation and utilization of high altitude point of view drawing the viewer into an understanding of some of the strategic dynamics in the military scenes. Conversely, the close up military sequences are rapid and confusing. This is not surprising for Oliver Stone has shown us with Platoon(1986) that he is committed to making the viewer aware of the speed and confusion inherent in personal hand to hand conflict. <br/><br/>Concerning the minor characters Christopher Plummer is fun as Aristotle. It is interesting how Alexander grows beyond Aristotle in particular concerning his view of cultural diversity and racial inclusion and one could be tempted to regard this as a flight of contemporary fancy but such a point of view would be belied by history. (See J.B.Bury A History of Greece, pp770 to 771)<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins has a much larger role as the narrator dictating the history of Alexander to a scribe. Hopkins acquits himself well but it is somewhat difficult to keep Hopkins in focus when your eyesight is constantly being besieged during his transcriptions by the films recreation of 4th Century B.C. Alexandrian interiors. <br/><br/>It is also a pleasure to see or rather hear Vangelis resurface again. His themes are distinctive and present but not overbearing.<br/><br/>It is my practice not to read reviews until after I've seen the film. I do this because I have found that I am rather easily influenced and seeing or hearing a review before the film runs the risk of contaminating the movie going experience.This rule is especially important in regards to films that have created a certain amount of anticipation and Alexander would certainly fall into that category. In the case of Alexander I had the misfortune to hear from friends and relatives that the film received really bad reviews. I pretended not to take notice but I was prepared for the worst. After all Oliver Stone is known for contemporary and not period pieces and for Stone to do a epic film about the ancient world seemed to be really going off the reservation. But let's not forget Scorcese did Last Temptation of Christ and that certainly was not about contemporary Little Italy. So I can not fully describe the relief that I felt when after no more then 10 minutes I realized that I was experiencing something new and breathtaking in film making. Bravo to Colin, Angelina, Val, Tony and the rest of the gang. Thanks for the memory. And to Oliver Stone, welcome back.<br/><br/>Joe Shannon November, 2004"

","I probably left my brain when I saw this movie on DVD. On several technical counts, it wasn't supposed to be a great movie. At various times, I felt that Colin lacked the authority to portray Alexander - I don't know whether this was due to the script itself. The frequency of the flashbacks barely worked for me.<br/><br/>And yet I immensely enjoyed this movie. Although I had to avert my eyes sometimes because of the violence, I enjoyed the battle scenes for how Alexander was able to defeat his opponents tactically. At certain points, I had to pause the movie while I googled details about the historical battle. This movie excited me.<br/><br/>The other reviewers are right - this movie is no Troy. I couldn't stand the Hollywood petulant-brat interpretation of Achilles in that movie. Troy is all cotton candy; I became too full of it about halfway through.<br/><br/>With the movie Alexander, I felt that I was right there, like a rapt scribe listening to a wonderful story of great deeds. (What do we watch movies for, again?)"
"nallll","10","1","3","5 June 2007"," I loved it. (Alexander Revisited)
","Before I begin, I would like to copy and paste something taken from IMDb because many people ask the question ''What is with the Irish accents?'' <br/><br/>'The Irish accents you hear from the Macedonian soldiers were not there to accommodate 'Colin Farrell' as some have asserted. As Macedonians were mostly from more remote hill tribes and were coarser and less civilized than the Greeks, the Celtic accents used in the movie serve to portray fictionally the difference between them and the more refined Greeks, such as Aristotle, played by 'Christopher Plummer' , who speaks in a more upper class, English accent. Many critics and audience members failed to understand this device.' -IMDb Alexander<br/><br/>Onto the review (Alexander Revisited) I first saw Alexander back in theatres in December of 2004. I was one of the few who actually enjoyed the film. I thought of the theatrical as a beautiful artistic view of the world's greatest military conquerer. Now when I went to see the movie; I did not hear anything from critics because at the time I had no knowledge of RottenTomatoes or IMDb, but when I saw it I found the websites only to be shocked to see how critically panned as it was. <br/><br/>Warning: (Possible spoilers ahead) Now, I own all three dvds. (Theatrical, Directors, and Final) I have to say that the Final is indeed the version to own. At nearly 3 1/2 hours, the Final Cut fills in the gaps that were missing from the theatrical release. Ill go off the record to say I have seen this film so many times, I can write you the script for it again. The Final Cut starts off completely different then from its originals. The Battle of Guagemela begins at the beginning of the film; most people complain about this battle because of 'confusion from the dust', well its a desert, so of course there is a lot of dust. I'll admit the battle needs to be watched more than once to understand it if you have not read a book on Alexander the Great. The scenes constantly switch with subtitles of ''Macedonian Right, or Left''. <br/><br/>After the scene at Gaugemela, we flash back towards Alexander's childhood beginning at Pella. Oliver Stone shows us how Alexander's mother is considered a sorceress and that she 'brainwashed' Alexander into believing he was the descendant of Achilles and the son of Zeus, because of this I believe that this film is a ''Greek Tragedy'' as the hero is also the son of a god, and because of that, he/she suffers greatly in the end. As we go through the childhood years, we see Alexander taming his beloved horse Buephelus, and his obsession with Greek heroes such as Heracles, Achilles, Jason, and Dionysus. <br/><br/>After his childhood years, we flash back to Babylon with an astonishing scene entrance to the city. We then move on to his campaign in North Eastern Persia to capture Darius and his marriage to Roxanne. As we reach the end of disc I, we run into the ''intermission''. In disc II, the viewer is introduced into India and Alexander's final battle in the film at Hydapess. This battle is even more awe inspiring than the first, greatly shot with real elephants and a very energizing climatic scene with Alexander and Porus. <br/><br/>I don't want to elaborate the whole movie (if your reading this) but I believe that a 5.4 rating for this film is criminal and that maybe one day this beautiful artistic film will receive the recognition it deserves. I want to point out that the title is 'Alexander' not 'Alexander the Great', I believe this film to be more about the man, than the legend. If you want to watch a film that was historically well researched and takes you to a distant place and time in history, Alexander will suit you nicely, but if your looking for a sword and scandal epic like Troy or Lord of the Rings, ill just advise you in case you do decide to watch the Final Cut to watch it with an open mind when it comes to paganism and homosexuality. <br/><br/>I own all three dvds, (Theatrical, Directors, and the Final Cut) I recommend the Final Cut if you have not seen it. I have in deed read the book ''Alexander the Great'' by Robin Lane Fox (who was a historical reference in this film) In the end, I cant wait for this to come out on HD-DVD. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading."
"jdkraus","9","1","3","2 February 2007"," A Bold and Authentic Alexander: the Cut
","I first saw this film in theaters on opening day and I thought I wasted three hours of my life. But when Oliver Stone claimed that there would release a Director's cut version of Alexander, I was willing to give it another try. And I have to say it, I actual enjoyed it. It is hard to depict such a man as Alexander. This film, did the near impossible. In my opinion, it does not really have one specific genre, but multiple ones. I mean, the film had multiple story lines from Alexander's personal thoughts, his family, the journey, and his friends of warriors around him. I am totally impressed that Stone has squeezed this all in within three hours and forty minutes.<br/><br/>So, the film is done in past tense with Old Ptolemy, forty years after Alexander's death, telling the tale of him to a scribe, for historical purposes. So, the narration of Old Ptolemy played by the wonderful Anthony Hopkins, begins it with important, but non interfering information.<br/><br/>The film reveals (as the original) his two parents. His mother, Olympias brutally ambitious and rather paranoid, played by Jolie, (whom still could have had some make up to make her look older), and his father Philip, who was a one-eyed, drunk, and did not give into affection easily, played by the famous Val Kilmer. Both of these two cast members in my opinion were wisely chosen and helped the film greatly, making it believable.<br/><br/>The film jumps around from the young Alexander learning the cruelty of the myths and the wisdom of Aristotle, played by the ancient Chris Plummer, the adolescent who faces the trouble of not having the crown as king with his father, and the adult Alexander, played by Colin Farrel, who starts off already years into his campaign to rule the world meeting King Darius of Persia at the Battle of Gaugamela, one of the best battles I have ever seen! The film follows Alexander with all of these events, leading him from Perisa, to Bactria and India, marrying Roxanne (Rosario Dawson) and his relationships with his friends and comrades, especially his lover Hephestian (Jareed Leto) whom loses faith and question his purpose of his journey.<br/><br/>With this, I have to mention though there are frequent flashbacks that show his adolescence occurring during his adulthood. Many people criticze this for making the film choppy, out of order, and off topic and even confusing, but I find each flashback exactly timely and not confusing at all; for they usually occur after a serious event that has happened in his adulthood, bringing forth Alexander's past memories as an adolescent (which has been neatly placed together in the director's cut). Even more so, these flashbacks hold some powerful scenes that expresses the true natures of his parents, particularly the manipulation and deceit that Angelina Jolie played very well.<br/><br/>With this at hand, Stone reveals a more in-depth and psychological version of Alexander, who lives as the naive young boy who ""puruse his dream heading east"" and bases his glory off of the Greek myths, which were well incorporated into the film, expressing the ""suffering and eternal glory"".<br/><br/>A studier of Greek mythology myself, I found this to be fascinating of how well it aided in the ambivalence that Alexander felt. Unfortunately though, not everyone understands the morals and importance of myths and tragedies, especially Greek. Bottom line, I have to break some hearts, this is not a ""popcorn loving"" film like King Arthur or Troy, but more of a thought-provoking film (as was the original cut). And I also have to add that the homosexuality remains. This easily was another criticism upon the film, but I have to say that I found it rather touching and more emotional than before, (since Alexander had a male companion), it felt more realistic for the film, no let down there. <br/><br/>Everything in this new version held its true beauty, especially with the pretty and enhanced music of Vangelis, the colorful cinematography, (especially the India battle of turning red, revealing death and bloodshed), the costumes and settings were grand, and the acting was more believable (Colin Farrel still gave gave an actual adequate performance). And the few battles in the film were absolutely outstanding and longer. They are in the league of violence as Gladiator and more strategically based, rather than a bunch of men charging into their deaths as in Braveheart or Sparacus. because of the strategy and ""choppyness"" as the negative critics call it, makes them more exciting and intense than any battles I have seen since The Lord of the Rings films.<br/><br/>However, I wish the film expressed more with his journey, such as the Greek Nations and Egypt, but it is hard to do for such a grand epic in a specific amount of time, and the time of the film itself drags in places, making the film slow. Otherwise, i was deeply satisfied.<br/><br/>****1/2 out of ***** Thumbs up Stone! It disappoints me of how people can't just appreciate such a film."
"xxjadedemoxx","Null","1","3","15 January 2007"," My thoughts.
","As of 12/1/2004, the movie has been made and has been released to lukewarm applause. The film, which Stone has been trying to get on the screen for 15 years, was filmed mainly in Morocco and Thailand. No scenes were shot in Greece, as the Athens News Agency explains, because of government opposition to Stone's portrayal of the Greek hero.<br/><br/>Incredibly, these ""erotic reality deniers"" are providing Mr. Stone free publicity and comic relief: A group of homophobic Greek lawyers is threatening to sue Warner Bros. and the director for implying Alexander the Great was bisexual. The lawyers, trampling their own heroic heritage underfoot, have sent a letter to the studio demanding they include a reference in the title credits saying his movie is a fictional tale.<br/><br/>To add to the Keystone Cops atmosphere surrounding this issue, it seems that a couple of years ago a mob of Macedonian Greeks hundreds strong stormed an archaeological symposium after a speaker presented a paper on the homosexuality of Alexander. Police were then called in to evacuate the participants.<br/><br/>Not that the rest of the west is any better. Apparently, the studio pressured Stone to cut out all the scenes of Alexander's affair with that dangerous brat Bagoas. No wonder the critics found the leftovers boring!"
"wummbumm","4","1","3","20 September 2006"," Epic and boring.
","I liked this movie for the nice costumes and settings. The battle scenes are nice as they give you the atmosphere of a big battle. On the other hand they are very long and you do not really understand (unlike e.g. in braveheart) what the strategy is that made one side win. Mostly you see slaughtering and leaders giving orders to attack this or that. What bores me and is that this movie clearly implies that Alexanders conquest of Persia is nothing different than the latest American military interventions in the Middle East. The language suggests it and most of the time you even forget that those are Greeks, so much is their point of view identical to an American perspective: The brave Greeks come to give the Persians freedom, the coward Persian King (=Osama bin Laden) flees into the Mountains from where he wages a ""guerilla war"" (a modern term employed by Aristotle in an anachronistic way). Beside a series of too long battle scenes you get an insight of Alexanders political alliances and his personal motivations. That is a bit more entertaining as it tries to give the characters some individual trait and tries to give a possible reason why Alexander the great went pushing on and conquering half of Asia. It also shows how his way of making the conquered provinces his allies guaranteed a certain stability to his empire. All in all you get some nice epic shots and lots of costumes, a portrait of Alexander that makes all a bit more entertaining without providing a very elaborated story or remarkable play-acting and Americans conquering the Middle East with swords and spears.<br/><br/>Another thing that I find funny is that many Greeks were upset when this movie came to the theaters because it portrayed their hero as a bisexual. Any historical research would have shown the homophobic protesters that deep friendships between men that could also tend towards homosexuality were common among their ancestors."

He only has sex with his wife and some creepy lookin' Babylonian shemale transvesite creature.<br/><br/>This could have been a great movie if Ang Lee or Ridley Scott (Gladiator) had done it.

That may be, but it is not entertaining. <br/><br/>It may be visually impressive but try turning off the picture and only listening to the sound and see how long you remain awake. The Irish accents do not help the boring dialogue. <br/><br/>While I was annoyed with the casting of Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie as son and mother since they are the same age, I did think Jolie carried off her role. Colin Farrell was not up to it. <br/><br/>I found this Alexander to be weak and uninspiring. I saw no reason to risk my life for him. It was a chore to watch the film even once. People that watch it more than once must be very dedicated Stone fans. <br/><br/>This would have to be Stone's worst film. The controversy over bisexuality is being used as a smoke screen to cover the fact that this film is just plain bad."
"Rogue-32","5","1","3","3 January 2006"," Alexander: He Had Balls
","I have to say this film was not as bad as the critics made it out to be, which didn't surprise me because I generally tend to enjoy Oliver Stone's movies. It was too long, no question, it was unbelievably repetitive and over-indulgent, which I've come to expect from Stone, and about halfway through it I found myself wondering, ""Where's Jim Morrison when you need him?"" (Val Kilmer could have easily got rid of the one-eye makeup and burst into song). And the back-and-forth story telling was sort of tedious, as well, I thought. Also, the movie lost some credibility with me early on, when one of Alexander's soldiers says to one of the other soldiers, ""he's got balls."" And then they drove off in a Maserati. (Kidding about the Maserati, but the 'balls' comment did feel really out of place in 300 BC, give or take a few years.)"
"awilliams-21","7","1","3","3 January 2006"," A remarkable film captures the madness and genius of its visionary hero.
","Alexander is a remarkable film. It's sprawling, ungainly, and way too long. Yet not long enough, either. It should have been a mini series. Oliver Stone had to leave a lot of material out, and his strategy of cutting back and forth in time was sometimes confusing. But he conveyed the most enduring and important legacy of Alexander the Great: his vision of a united, multi-ethnic world empire, dominated by Greek principles but inclusive of indigenous cultural values. Alexander really was the first conqueror/leader to pursue such a vision, rather than merely trying to impose his culture on other peoples. It was an impossible vision to achieve, in part because of nationalistic prejudices and in part because Alexander himself was torn between genius and madness. This is what the movie captures astonishingly well, along with the rich visual tapestry of ancient life and the terrifying battle scenes. The film is quite accurate concerning the psychological dynamics of Alexander's relationship with his parents (and the parents' with each other). Too many movies, especially ""action movies,"" overlook the role of the parent-child relationship in the formation of character. I also applaud Stone's attempt to be true to Alexander's sexual relationships with his comrade Hephaistion and his eunuch Bagoas, though the film should have made that element more explicit. Viewers who liked this film might want to check out historical novelist Mary Renault's books about Alexander, FIRE FROM HEAVEN and THE PERSIAN BOY."
"set_fla","7","1","3","7 December 2005"," Worth Seeing
","This was not a bad movie, regardless of what you have read. On the other hand, it was not a great movie either. There was a lot more to Alexander than battles. I wish Stone had spent more time on showing the side of Alexander that really made him Great, the ability to make peace with those he conquered. To anyone who has read a great deal about him, they realize that Alexander was not a barbarian but more of an idealist about how things should be. I will avoid the entire bi/gay issue. My only comment is that if Stone had really played it the way most historians believe, he would not have been able to get major stars and distribution.<br/><br/>My final comment is to do some reading about Alexander and then see the movie and appreciate it for what Stone did well."
"rsartisttouch-1","7","1","3","30 September 2005"," Not as Bad as Critics Have Reviewed the Film to Be.
","I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining Alexander is and did not agree that this film deserved the poor reviews I've read so far. I attribute this to some clever film editing in certain parts of the film, resulting in an evenly paced rendition considering Alexander kept going and conquering everything east of home. There have been two other historical epics that focused on ancient Rome and Greece that were released during the past five years and thought Alexander made TROY look and sound just plain dumb, Alexander having overall more intelligent and involving dialog. Also I felt Alexander was more rich, lush and honest in it's screenplay and art direction, and was impressed by the costume design. I must applaud Oliver Stone for not hiding the truth about Alexander's personal life. Like it or not, that is the way a lot of soldiers related to one another back then. Being honest in depicting Alexander's personal relationships allowed for more freedom in character development; had Stone ignored history, the film would have had a lot of the stilted feel of TROY. I feel that a lot of the bad reviews were not honest; the reviewers perhaps too afraid to say they didn't appreciate the portrayal of unrestrained intimacy between Alexander and his friends, and for the rest of the Army. So they deliberately searched deeply for flaws.<br/><br/>Any film which picks me up and makes me forget I'm sitting in a chair in a theater is a pretty darn good film, and my involvement with Alexander was like a magic carpet ride in places; Stone hypnotizes in some scenes very well and in just the right places. Colin Farrell was just right for the role of Alexander; Angelina Jolie would have been given more credit had this been a premier role/film for her; instead she is so distinctive being herself that it is distracting - almost to the point of making me feel there was a commercial coming up soon. Further, the most annoying thing I found about the film was that Alexander and everyone around him all had heavy Irish, Scottish and English accents. Does anyone remember how out of place Ralph Richardson's accent was in DR. ZHIVAGO?<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film overall, and plan to view it 3 or 4 more times. My thanks to Stone and everyone involved for historically accurate storytelling!"

It could not compare to any similar great historical stories such as Gladiator or Braveheart. The movie was meant to be biographical but focused way too much on the theory that he was homosexuality. It explained very little on his conquests but did a very good job on his childhood(Although Val Kilmer played Colin Farrell's dad). Overall, the movie was very disappointing to me, considering Olvier Stone is a personal favorite and the story of Alexander the Great is also a favorite of mine.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie."

The veteran soldiers all seemed to have had an eye put out. They wouldn't last much on a battle field where lateral and 3D vision would be essential to survive.<br/><br/>I was most disappointed overall, although the effort was evidently considerable in terms of resources put in.

"Caliann","7","1","3","13 June 2005"," Oliver Stone's Alexander
","Given 5 hours I'm sure the Master would have vanquished complaints of time warp, blessed us with fewer monologues and more comprehensive character development. However, Alexander is what it is -- and somewhat less than it could have been. To convey the enormous reach of young Alexander's conquests, their impact on the conquered as well as the conquering, Stone uses monologue narration via Anthony Hopkins (Ptolemy) as he used him in NIXON, and Costner in JFK -- to array the facts, and ask the key questions. No one can create these larger than life portraits and still serve the facts and the gaps better than Oliver Stone. However, if one can't accept how Stone does his work, then they may as well pick another flick. But, if one enjoys feasting on spectacle, Stone's rendition of the battle at Gaugamela is astonishing, with his aerial shots, swish pans, stuttering cuts of an army of individuals, with the eerie guttural sounds of who-knows-what that make the gut turn and the skin crawl. All this said, even though Stone says that Colin Farrell ""became Alexander,"" he perhaps was too fine a rendition of the bi-sexual conqueror. He voice wasn't low enough. He wasn't muscled enough. His face wasn't fierce enough. And of course that's the point. But I needed to see a young Russell Crowe conquering the world on Bucephalus. Finally, Irish accents and Jolie's ludicrous lilt designed to clarify the distinction between Greeks and Macedonians wasn't worth the distraction."
"jeremias-vahasalo","5","1","3","12 June 2005"," money makers?
","Well, I think that Oliver Stone is a great director, but this time he really tried to direct an epic story that would rise to live up to the expectations of many of his fans. With this story and a pretty nice casting, it could have been a classic, though with a few bad flaws. Some of his previous works have really influenced the film scene and other movie makers but this time I think he's biting his own tail. First of all, the film is either lacking or twisting a lot of historical facts about Alexander, especially about his cruelty and obscene sexual behavior. In general, I think most of the film makers in Hollywood tend to alter their original style in order to kiss more butt and get the attention of big audiences. Is it all about money? Are the producers nowadays as greedy as the real Alexander the Great?"

Colin Farrell is spectacular as Alexander because he is capable of showing the many sides of the character such as his grief, his courage and his love. Historically it is very accurate and contains the great legends that surround the history of Alexander.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has hit a home run i think for this movie because he portrays the story of Alexander without ruining any of his greatness. Because if you look at all of the aspects of his life you could never make a whole movie. Using Anthony Hopkins as the narrator helps out because it helps you understand certain characters and fills in the history gaps.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is wonderful, most notably Val Kilmer who plays Philip II, Alexander's father. He portrays both sorrow and anger in the character, one that is very believable. The settings of the movie are beautiful. From the hills of Greece to the sands of Persia, to the jungles of India, the backdrop is spectacular.<br/><br/>This movie was also denied the Oscars in my opinion.

Still it results in a film that neither provides us with a fascinating experience, nor with a strong portrayal of this Macedonian legend. <br/><br/>The weakness of this movie lies somehow in the ambition to cover too many aspects of Alexanders life. The result is just too predictable: a film in which none of the aspects of Alexanders life, all capable of bringing us a brilliant film theme, is properly worked out. <br/><br/>Alexanders relationship with his mother: not done fully The homosexual side of Greek society: not done fully Alexander the great conqueror/general: idem Alexander as an enigmatic figure: idem Alexander the ruthless: idem <br/><br/>Each of these theme's, and numerous others, is only briefly touched by the filmmakers, resulting in a heap of scenes, that's hardly knit together by either storyline, plot or character development. <br/><br/>The character of Alexander the great doesn't stand out as a result either. it's pretty much 'Alexander the weak', neither human, neither the half-god.

It starts with the battle in Germania and then, every 15 minutes or so after that, Maximus is in the arena chopping off heads. It kept everything moving along nicely.<br/><br/>It took 45 minutes of absolute boredom in Alexander to get to the first battle & that was Gaugamela!!! Straight to the main course, no appetisers in the siege of Tyre or the battles at Issus or Granicus, each battle which was both important and different from the rest in all aspects (besides the outcome, Alexander always won). Rather than the tedium of showing Philip II as a carousing alcoholic (well played by Val Kilmer though), it was Philip who trained the Macedonian army to be what it was, that would have made much better cinema. Darius' part was reduced to a mere cameo, yet he was the main antagonist (on the surface at any rate) for Alexander!!!! There was too many attempts at showing some sort of ""divine destiny"" of Alexander and not enough showing what Alexander was remembered as ""The Great"" for, for being the truly great battlefield general he was.<br/><br/>I still can't believe I walked out of the cinema thinking ""This was about as good as Troy, and that's not saying much."" I can only hope that if Steven Pressfield's excellent ""Gates Of Fire"" is to be turned into a movie as has been mooted many times, that the producers learn the lessons from Alexander (& Troy) and concentrate on what really matters in history, the battles, how they were fought and who won."

But this is despite of the story being told, not because of it. Farrell is miscast and is unable to conjur sympathy essential to his character. When his troops protest that they've suffered many casualties and made many sacrifices over seven years of following him - couldn't they just go home for a bit?... I found myself agreeing with them (having seen brutal casualties in Stones visceral style) and becoming irritated by Alexanders whining about 'conquering new frontiers' or some such rubbish. Its waaay too long and doesn't come close to Ridley Scott's Gladiator (itself a little too long).<br/><br/>But I'm being unkind. Its truly epic, with dramatic battle scenes that are suitably brutal. The idea of this band of Macedonian explorers is satisfying. Alexander is certainly better than Troy. Lets see what Ridley Scott can do with 'Kingdom of Heaven' - it needs to be good or the studios may fall out of love with the epic. Alexander is another nail in the coffin of the genre, Disappointing."

","While this movie is not as bad as many reviewers and others have said, it is deeply disappointing.<br/><br/>Let us begin with the homosexuality thing. Whether or not Alexander the Great was gay, straight, bi-sexual, or something else altogether involving monkeys or whatever with regards to sexual preference is really not that important. In the Greek world of Alexander's time, sexuality--historians and the like seem to say--was nowhere near as prudish and puritanical as America today, blue state or red state, and if one were inclined to sleep with men or boys or girls or slaves or what the hell ever, then society in general wasn't likely to obsess about it.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has said as much when discussing the film, and that makes the film's treatment of Alexander's sexuality even more peculiar and unfortunate, because the film absolutely DOES obsess about Alex the Great maybe being a bit of a homo.<br/><br/>If it was not that important at the time, why spend so much time on it. If it's not that important at the present--and it certainly is not--why devote so much screen time to it.<br/><br/>It's like this: You're making a movie about one of the most interesting and enigmatic historical figures ever--really; you have give or take three hours in which to tell this epic story. It's not that Alexander's sexuality should be avoided or glossed over; it's just not that important. The guy conquered a rather large portion of the known world; so his favorite place to store his genitalia just is not that important. The guy is queer; the guy is sort of queer; the guy is not queer at all--whatever, get back to the more interesting world conquering business already.<br/><br/>Let's move on. I am a huge fan of Oliver Stone. He's not everybody's cup of tea; I think he's phenomenal. Perhaps, though, he was not the right director for this difficult material. I usually enjoy Stone's trademark directorial indulgences, but, as with the gay/not gay stuff, there is just a limited amount of time for this story. So, maybe Stone just Freuded out too much on this one.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it's OK. Colin Farrell is OK. Kilmer is decent. Jolie is way over the top, but oh well. Jared Leto is actually pretty good. Rosario Dawson is actually quite good, and there is a scene with her that I guarantee will hypnotically transport you back to your breastfeeding days.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is just simply the script. This is an epic story; it is challenging material, and it just did not pull it off. If there is a fatal flaw in this flawed film, it is the inability to fully convey the historical, cultural and military achievements of Alexander the Great--or even come close.<br/><br/>This was Alexander the Sort of Interesting, Alexander the Possible Flamer, Alexander the Braveheart Clone, and Alexander the Still Mysterious because they couldn't write a screenplay not condescending to moviegoers."
"jclarke-5","2","1","3","30 January 2005"," Terrible film - wasted opportunity
","I was looking forward to seeing this film but came away bitterly disappointed - as did my husband, a history buff, who was more eager than I to see Alexander 'come to life' as it were. My criticism with the film has nothing to do with Alexander's relationship with Hephaistion (most who criticise the critics seem to assume this could be the only reason for criticism) but with the wealth of historical events completely omitted. One critic put it best when she wrote: 'Alexander may have conquered the world but you never understand how or why in this movie.' (Jackie Cooper). We never fully appreciate in the film Alexander's abilities as a military leader; his relationships with Hephaistion, his mother, his wives etc, get more coverage than this - and it is his abilities as General and leader that make him 'Great'! What of The Battle of Issus, the conquest of Asia Minor, the Siege of Tyre and the Gordium knot? And the arrow wound he suffers was not historically accurate; there was no siege of the city of Multan portrayed at all.<br/><br/>The main reason for disappointment is the fact that it had the potential to be a trilling epic about a brilliant military leader; instead it was a dull movie which focused predominantly on the non-military/leadership aspects of Alexander's life - not the 'Great' parts; one could be forgiven for thinking he was a relatively weak leader after 3 hours of drudgery. Don't waste your time or money on it; if you have any interest in Alexander hire a good documentary; they will provide much greater entertainment than this film."
"Bantam","6","1","3","27 January 2005"," Bushy
","Well, it was historically more accurate than Troy, King Arthur and the like, the story itself was fairly okay, that is if you do not really know anything except the name. Even the part about Alexander and Hepheistos being lovers. (Even though this fact is a controversy among historians, and some accuse him of being not only bi, but rather a pedophile.) The movie itself was enjoyable, no doubt, and the acting was fairly decent. I liked the battle scenes, as they were more accurate than in other movies. The average life span of a foot soldier (even into the late middle ages) in battle was about 10 minutes. <br/><br/>Now let's get to the fishy part: have you noticed all this wild talk about ""liberating"" Persia? At it's peak, Alexander is in Babylon, mumbling about his father who could not bring that kind of freedom to the middle-east and so forth. Man, if I would not know it better, it would be as if the movie was about George W. Bush and his father, who failed in 91 with his little crusade in Iraq. If the movie is a mirror of today's political situation, it is really accurate. Look at it! You have a nation (Macedon) which conquers large parts of the known world, ""liberating"" the people from the oppression of its former rulers. Then Alexander gave the rule back to the people who lived there (in modern words having them elect their own leaders) and pacifies the lands from the Mediteranian to Inda. That sounds fairly familiar, does it not?<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I dislike the message in the movie."
"alexandrosg","7","1","3","23 January 2005"," Not bad at all
","I can't explain the overall 5.5.<br/><br/>Maybe it was not the best movie of the year, but it sure showed to everyone who Alexander the Great was and what he has achieved. Especially for those people out there who do not have a clue about historical faces, this movie will help them appreciate the value of being a real leader, a pragmatic emperor, and of course which are the drawbacks of such a heroic and ultra optimistic figure.<br/><br/>Very nice role playing by everyone in the movie.<br/><br/>The only disadvantage might have been the ""overcoverage"" of his bi-sexual life (and that is why some scenes were cut in the Greek 'market') but OK.<br/><br/>It's worth watching though, even if you are not a fan of historical/war films."
"Dominique_de_r","7","1","3","23 January 2005"," Alexander, The Tragic
","When you read about Achilles and Hercules, you read about heroes. Heroes that want no more than victory and fame. They get the fame. When you have read about those heroes. You have probably heard about Alexander The Great too. He was a hero just like them. But he did exist. That made him larger than life. For written characters like Achilles and Hercules are probably made up.<br/><br/>While watching this film, I realised Alexander was pushed. I bet he didn't even know he wanted to be a hero. His father wanted him to stay humble, his mother wanted to make him king. His best friend Hefaiston made him king by shouting it through the arena.<br/><br/>Alexander wanted to explore the East, he wanted to be allies with the Greek ""enemies"". And more and more his people start to doubt him. Because what are his intentions really? Does he want to make ""barbarians"" into Greeks. Or does he want to conquer the world and explore everything. His men know one thing: The are not going home soon. That's when they start to revolt. And Alexander loses his grip on his men.<br/><br/>I think this movie really reflect the Greek way of thinking. And of acting too. I do not believe Alexander was really gay. But there seems to be a chemistry between him and his best friend Hefaiston. I think that is realistic. They grew up together, they fought together and they survived together. That grows a bond stronger than love. But gay or not. Alexander (as it shows in this film) is really just a mortal man. With nothing more than a boyish dream to see the rest of the world."

Colin Farrell does his best in a role which could have been better cast, and Angelina Jolie along with a very bad accent does try hard to put across his mothers role, but other than the superb scenery and locational shots and a good performance from the actor who plays Alexander as a child, this film was far too long and left me very disappointed."
"statistician_t","2","1","3","18 January 2005"," Alexander the Confused
","I've seen this movie some day's ago with my girlfriend. On walking out, I was fully ashamed that I recommended her this film; and I want rather commit suicide than watching this ""epic"" again.<br/><br/>The film clearly had too much talking, and when a battle ends, only the narrator explains what the results and the consequences of this battle were. Huh, and there are only *two* battles in a three-hour ""epic"" about Alexander the Great? I thought he was a conqueror, not a emotion-laden sissy. The real Alexander committed atrocities (by far bigger ones than silencing a mutiny), he burned down Persepolis, the capital of Persia - but where do we find these important events? A comparison with another ""conqueror"" epic, ""Patton"", shows what went wrong with ""Alexander"". I am not a great military buff, but I that's one of my favorite movies  that's why I mention it. In ""Patton"", it is really shown what the main character did and felt by his own actions, in Alexander, most emotional problems are *told* by a snake fanatic. Go and watch ""Patton""! In ""Patton"", there was a logical sequence of events, but in ""Alexander"", it seemed to me that, from the countless battles Alexander the Great has lead, only two were selected randomly. One in the desert, the second one in the Indian forest. Huh, I wondered, why Alexander is suddenly transformed into a warlord? Suddenly there is a battle! Ho, mount the horses! I am a military leader! I thought people would grow into such a role...<br/><br/>Why was the Indian forest battle such a bloodfeast? I meant any experienced soldier would avoid fighting in a forest where the defender has an advantage.<br/><br/>One other point is that Alexander isn't shown as a real homosexual. I really *waited* for the first kiss between Alexander and Hephaistion because the newspapers rumored so much about that. How would an that (once) great Oliver Stone handle this topic, I wondered. But then, it ended in harmless hugging between Alexander and Hephaistion. What a rubbish! I hope Oliver Stone has to work off the $150'000'000 failure in a most cruel sort of slave labor..."

Reducing this story to just one film, an impossible task. Three movies like the Lord of the Rings would have worked much better. b. Casting was poor, Colin Farrel is a good actor, but hardly an Alexander, there was no grace or poise or authority in the character. If my reading is correct Alexander had an elegance, sorry Colin all I could see when watching the film was Mel Gibson and Braveheart! c. The style of filming was 'bitty' and erratic which took away from the pleasure of viewing and d.

"MOscarbradley","7","1","3","16 January 2005"," Stone goes so far, but not all the way.
","""Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion"". And with that line you know where you're at, and while Oliver Stone's epic never gets down and dirty with any boy-on-boy action, (long, lingering looks, a lot of bear-hugs and a kiss planted firmly on the lips of a luscious male slave is as hot as it gets), this is, nevertheless, a remarkably frank depiction of homosexuality, or at least bisexuality, for a mainstream studio epic. It's in that lack of boy-on-boy action that Stone fudges things; having gone so far as he does, you just wish he would have gone the extra mile. Did he really think that as it stands this would really play in Middle America? Or maybe by pulling the plug on the sex and concentrating on the violence he thought they just wouldn't get it? Still, it's certainly not the turkey I had been lead to believe. Stone draws parallels between Alexander's campaign in Persia and what is happening in Iraq. Alexander's empire could be seen as a thinly disguised America with a similar record in botched foreign policy. His heart may have been in the right place but massacring the natives wasn't going to win him many friends abroad.<br/><br/>Not without it's little absurdities, (as if to compensate for Colin Farrel's Irish brogue, Stone populates the film with other Irish actors and even has Val Kilmer coming over all Oirish as his father), it is still an intelligent and potent piece of cinema. While it's two battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed it's essentially a talkative epic and clocking in at almost three hours is never boring.<br/><br/>Farrel is surprisingly effective in the title role, Irish accent and all, and Angelina Jolie redeems her recent spate of mediocre performances with a nice turn as his mother. Unfortunately Anthony Hopkins as an ancient Ptolemy comes over too much like Richard Attenborough and none of the rest of a large cast are given enough screen time to make any kind of impression. But it's still well worth seeing and may well turn out to be the most undeservedly over-looked film of the year."
"dr_tooley","1","1","3","16 January 2005"," Poor Casting, Poor script Poor direction.
","I had so much anticipation before seeing this film. But in the end it seemed to be a poor cross between the history channel and a gay sex in the city.<br/><br/>I won't summarise the plot as most know it already.<br/><br/>The only person to come out intact was Val Kilmer. His almost perfect portrayal of an edgy, alcoholic, despot was breath-taking. Colin Farrell by contrast seemed not to be able to cope. Alexander was a notorious alcoholic, yet Farrell's character is remarkably sober throughout. The one time he seemed a little drunk was in killing Cleitus, in the party scene in India. Here he kills a man who has fought with him in all his campaigns, yet it the film he does it fully cognisant, fully sober and completely unbelievably.<br/><br/>The so called homo-erotic scenes between Farrell's Alexander and Jared Leto's Hephaistion were so laughable they merit no comment. Most people seemed not be offended by their inclusion but rather at how badly these scenes were performed. The only thing I would ask the director is as Firth seemed so uncomfortable with the gay scenes why make these scenes so integral to the film? I know a man like Alexander is too big to cover in a film. But this was pathetic. Alexander the man who conquered what was then the greatest empire the world had ever seen. The man who founded countless cities, never defeated in battle, and persuaded men form the ""Hicksville"" end of Greece to fight to the end of the known world. A man who convinced older men and wiser men that impossible dreams could not only be dreamt but made real. This man in this film is reduced to an a character out of the OC, forever pondering the psycho dynamics of the situation in between getting his leg over with the next dark eyed, dark haired man.<br/><br/>The script seemed to have been written by people that had drunk all the wine meant for Alexander. Come on guys you are better than this! The direction had no flow, no continuity, no consistency and in fact no quality.<br/><br/>The only scenes that were reasonable were the expansive shots of the Mountains. But this director is no David Lean. No John Ford. And even these scenes seem to feel like some kind of travel show than an historic epic.<br/><br/>When I watched this film, for the first time in a long time people started walking out of the cinema. I don't blame them.<br/><br/>In short this film is complete flawed. But the greatest crime is that is could have been great but should have good. Unfortunately where this film needed a director like David Lean or Stanley Kubrick; we instead got someone that should limit his endeavours to the history channel.<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks this film was good needs to develop an opinion. Simply opposing the opinion of the Conservative right in the US does not make for a realistic appraisal."

","was that two out of five could only be 40% successful, and boredom filled the gap. So it beats the Scottish film by a factor of at least 30. Angelina Jolie again showed that all she needs is nitro fuel, and something round her upper left arm. As usual, I didn't like camera blur substituting for the ice-cold crystal-clear full-colour experience that is imminent death. There's little else specific that I can point to as being no good, other than the lack of Issus, Granicus and especially Tyre. The latter could have easily been done as a brief CG shot. There were, probably, too many words, some of which were not entirely germane, and oveall an attempt to do something high-minded which did not quite come off either. On to Hannibal..."

Colin Farell plays a big cry-baby - nearly half of the film he's sobbing over all kinds off stuff. Also, content is quite bad; don't expect a great story, because, historically there isn't one, and the movie is in that respect well conform to reality. But the worst is the soundtrack.

Even this was acceptable, but the Great Alexander behaves like a not much respected platoon leader, constantly in quarrels with his troops. This is so not convincing, if you then know he had to rule x100.000 soldiers over so many years. He might have had an Oedipus-complex, but then he was a Tyran.

And not just that. There is no doubt that cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto has delivered beautiful pictures in AMORES PERROS or 25TH HOUR but it also makes sense that the cameraman of 21 GRAMMS isn't the right person to do shoot a blockbuster-epic. There are hardly any establishing shots and ever since GLADIATOR someone thinks its good just to shake the camera through battle-scenes so no one sees whats going on.<br/><br/>Along with that, Alexander is like a play with a few characters showing only two of the hero's many battles which would be interesting but then the story is told much to fragmentarily and leaves way too many gaps.<br/><br/>The great plus tough is that Colin Farrel portraits a bisexual hero and despite all the fuss from conservative Greek lawyers it totally works fine and is the rare example of showing a gay character not as either a funny sidekick, a wimp or a problem child but as a strong leading man.<br/><br/>And the film definitely deserves credit for that."

","I read some of the reviews here, and expected an 'artsy' and even boring film. In fact, I saw (one of) the best historical films ever made in Hollywood. The story of the life of Alexander is told with clarity and restraint. As far as I know (and /nobody/ knows what really happened back then) the story is quite accurate.<br/><br/>It's all there, the epic battles, the ancient philosophers, the splendour of the Eastern urbane civilisations, the complex psychology, the love affairs, and the politics, the adventures of weary armies facing many hardships.<br/><br/>Let me address some of the major points of criticism: <br/><br/><ul><li>Long and boring: I find it too short. The life of Alexander should be made into a film twice that long. It is never dull, at least not to an educated, adult audience. I can only guess at the level of mindlessness you must be used to.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bad cast, bad acting: no such thing. All the characters seem real to me.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Too much homosexuality: The relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion is shown like a deep and romantic form of friendship between men, rather than a lustful sexual affair. Sex between men was probably not uncommon in those days, if that offends you, too bad.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Regional sensitivities: are you Greek, Iranian, or whatever, and you think the point of this forum is to bore us with your small minded pride and arrogance? The film clearly shows how Alexander, the Macedon, admired the Persians because of their culture that was far in advance of the goat herding Europeans'.</li></ul><br/><br/>Minor criticisms.

An absolute disgrace. I couldn't believe it.<br/><br/>Folks I've seen a LOT of films in my day, from all over the world, and I'll be honest here, it has left me dumbfounded how anyone can have anything good to say about this film. Seriously. It's the most poorly constructed film I've ever seen - I'm expecting my friend in film school to have to watch this as an instructional on how not to make a film. I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>First off, this 2 hour & 53 minute movie has 18 minutes of fighting. Spilt between just 2 battles. One of which Alexander doesn't clearly win, the other Alexander clearly loses.<br/><br/>The rest is BRUTALLY bad dialogue, directed TERRIBLY - repeating the same melodramatic purpose (or nothing at all) over and Over and OVER and ~OVER~.. It wasn't Battlefield Earth: ""This-movie-sucks- so-sit-down-and-watch-this -because-you'll-die-laughing -at-these-people-who -thought-this-was-good"" type of a bad movie. ... It's simply the most boring, God-forsaken, slapped together incoherent piece of @%$# I've seen in half a decade. Utterly horrible.<br/><br/>(At this point, my friend mentioned that now she wants to see it because it sounds so bad...) So I say........<br/><br/>Keep in mind, it's just plain BORING.. - although there are ""parts"" that are especially brutal, it's the movie as a whole that just sucks utterly. -- Try not to cringe at overly melodramatic lines like: ""You can run.. but you can't run far enough!!!!"" and fingernail-on-the-blackboard shrieks of ""Noooo!!!"" at all of the lamest of moments.<br/><br/>Try to ignore the following: -- that Colin Farrel's mom is Angelina Jolie and is basically the same age as him. -- that a lot of the statues look like they were made by a ""The Learning Annex"" paper mache class -- -- That the dialogue must've been written by high school students with a handy thesaurus... -- how many times they resort to ""glances"" to ""the-pretty-boy-in-the-corner-with-no-name"" again - just to try and kill even more time... -<br/><br/>.....So........

I can't BELIEVE they made something so HORRIDLY boring. It blows my mind.<br/><br/>If the gods frown on you and you end up sitting through Alexander, try this: When Alexander is in the mountains and he stops marching and asks his friend/commander/whoever-he-was: ""Where has our eagle gone?"" Proclaim: ""The peasants ate it!"" You'll get a nice big laugh, trust me - Everyone will appreciate it -- and be shocked that someone was listening to the film.<br/><br/>To wrap the film up, when the big, glittery, slow-motion mystic eagle swoops towards the camera and the credits come up -- you'll be able to scream ""Thank GOD!!!!"" -- I did.<br/><br/>Kids, this is a glorious Symphony of Complete Garbage..

I can not believe that it was Oliver Stone's movie till now.... what went wrong with you Oliver.... seems you have not read the history properly.... who said that the Great Empire of Persia were just barbarians and tribes with no education or organized Army... would you tell how come then they were the greatest empire in their times..... How come you you do not give a bit more of details about the period he spent in Egypt and when he was crowned and announced son of Amon not Zeos as you said in your film... this is not correct. Film was too long with some meaningless scenes.... do not think he was that torn kid chasing a dream to be like one of the Greek gods.... I thought I would know more about his brilliant military skills..... did not believe what you said about the new world and the meet between Asia and Europe.... could not believe you can make such a horrible movie with the same clichés..... always west brings freedom to the east...this is not correct at all<br/><br/>you have made a big sin you did not read the history and this film is unforgiven and unforgotten sin made by you the people who loved you and believed in you...<br/><br/>East is not bad..east is not barbarians...east does not need the west to bring freedom and military training..... east was far advanced than Europe... ages ago..... your film is a typically Hollywood one..... with nonsense..... no message.... no nothing...<br/><br/>I am very sorry and very disappointed....."

","In three weeks since it's Thanksgiving 2004 release, Alexander has only recouped less than one/forth of it's $150 million dollar budget. The film just trods along. It's impossible to buy Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mom. She doesn't bloody age. (Well, her idea of aging 25 years in this film is to hoist her hair up in a bun and don't run around screaming as much.) Colin Farell gives a good performance as Alexander, but he doesn't come across as the conquerer on much of the world. He comes across more like an above average Burger King manager. CGI work tends to mar the battle scenes. The super-clean sets are a joke. They look like something out of ""Alexander- the Video Game"" What has happened to Oliver Stone?"

","**NO SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Me and my brother seriously thought that this movie MIGHT be worth while. We sat down for this movie having no idea that Mr. Oliver Stone had such evil in store for us. This movie seriously should have been called ""Alexander: Didn't You Know He Was Gay?."" I have never seen a movie have so many references to homosexuality in my entire life. Right there, you should know that bringing kids under the age of, oh lets say, 40 should not see this atrocious blunder of money, time and marketing effort. Maybe I'm not artsy, maybe I don't understand what I am missing but seriously Oliver Stone almost makes you wonder about his personal life. <br/><br/>If this hasn't stopped you from seeing this movie, read the following:<br/><br/>Step 1.) Stand Up from the Computer Screen<br/><br/>Step 2.) Raise right hand to sky<br/><br/>Step 3.) Send right hand thrusting downward to right cheek<br/><br/>Step 4.) Repeat until nigh on unconscious and bloodied<br/><br/>There, now you know what watching this movie is like.<br/><br/>Acting was par to sub-par throughout, historically speaking - almost completely inaccurate, and I seriously can't believe that Sir Anthony Hopkins even gave this movie the time of day to be the narrator after reading the script: assuming he read the script. Shame on those FOUR overpaid editors (Yann Hervé, Gladys Joujou, Alex Marquez, Thomas J. Nordberg) who made the first 2 hours seem more eclectic than quotes from a drug-frenzied Peter Griffin during an ether binge. Government monkeys from the movie Project X could have done a better job making this movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: On a Scale of 1 to 10, this movie gets a '1.0,' because the last 30 minutes almost make you believe Stone was trying to direct."

","When I searched the internet for Oliver Stone's filmography, I came across a site that described him as ""Hollywood's Most Exciting and Controversial Film Director"". Whilst I would disagree, actually, on both points, at least you can see how someone might come to this conclusion: ""U Turn"" (1997), as I recall, was watchable drama not striving to re-write history or pretending to be anything other than cinema, and visually extremely stylish to boot; ""Wall Street"" (1987) was light-hearted fun done at a fast pace; ""JFK"" (1991) was, well, controversial; and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989) was, I suppose, exciting and sort-of controversial. (I may have tuned out for the next installments of Vietnam until ""Nixon"" (1995), which contained such a ridiculous performance by Anthony Hopkins that I felt moved to leave the theater.)<br/><br/>In the Venn Diagram of Oliver Stone's films, however, ""Alexander"" would join (along with ""Nixon"") a circle labeled Unintentionally Hilarious, and also a larger, overlapping circle labeled Virtually Unwatchable (which would also contain ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994) and ""Any Given Sunday"" (1999)). Whilst Angelina Jolie speaks in what to me sounds like a modern Yugoslav accent, Colin Farrell and Val Kilmer use Irish accents (which would make sense uniquely for Farrell, assuming the actors had instructions to use their native accents). Kilmer, forced to act the drunken pig whilst declaiming dialog as wooden as anything ever improvised on the theme of Ancient Civilization, appears to belong to a different movie entirely. Eventually, the realization dawns that that movie does in fact exist: and that it is Stone's ""The Doors"" (1991). Other disturbing thoughts enter your mind as you watch ""Alexander"", among them, this: Farrell seems to have based his look at least in part on Jon Voight in ""Midnight Cowboy"". (Could this have been accidental, given Jolie's major contribution?) Ultimately, I was disappointed by the non-appearance Jim Garrison to explain the impossibility of an archer getting off shots accurately from elephant-back. Verdict: Oliver must re-sit History yet again."

A horrific script (what in the ancient world was Stone thinking?), tragic miscasting of almost every male role, laughably bad acting, hackneyed and boring cinematography, and amateurish editing have been tossed together to present not the potentially engaging and exciting historical drama that we all expected, but instead brought us Stone's ""Gay Alex's Plan-9 from Outer Mongolia"".

","This movie was sheer mental retardation, to the 25th power. It had nothing to do with Alexander the Great. It was about a certain director's typical tom-foolery and intense interest (if not lust) for homosexuality. Can someone answer why in every movie Stone makes there's are scenes where the characters are having orgies doing drugs and performing anal sex? It happened in Midnight Express, JFK, and Alexander. The movie is sheer propaganda. It says nothing of Alexander's exploits, makes up events that never happened (about 75% of the movie at least), omits crucial events to the very essence of the man (eg the Gordian knot, the siege of Babylon, the unification of Greece and Persia through marriage, etc) and makes the young king who conquered the known world out to be a whiney, sniveling, self hating, low self esteem cry baby who blames everything that goes wrong on his mother (Freudian bullcrap).If you edit the film so that Alexander's whiney and homosexual scenes are omitted, you'll have about 4 minutes of film at best (including credits). In the end this movie is nothing but sheer nonsense. There is no point to the movie. It lacks action, it lacks meaning, it lacks truth, it lacks plot, it lacks purpose. Watch it and you'll regret it. You'll hate yourself because that is 3 hours of your life you will never get back."

","'Alexander' (Colin Farrell) is based on the true story of the greatest military leader in the world during the fourth century B.C. Alexander first led his army to Western Asia, and though greatly outnumbered, defeated the Persian army. Next Alexander took his army into Central Asia and then into India. Alexander the Great conquered 90% of the known world and forged an empire stretching from Greece to India by the time of his death at age 32.<br/><br/>The film is not your mainstream story of battle and glory, but a look at Alexander's life and his relationships with his father Philip (Val Kilmer), his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), his wife Roxane (Rosario Dawson), and his lifelong boyfriend Hephaistion (Jared Leto). The movie explores some of the social customs and morals that were customary during that time. Oliver Stone has taken one of the most fascinating men in history and turns his life into a suffering ordeal as a Hamlet-like person. Yes, there were some battles scenes in the movie, but I think Stone had to put them in, because that is what made Alexander the Great. I did not enjoy the movie, because it was slow and boring, and there was too much emphasis on Alexander's sexually. The elephant battle scene in India was a little unreal, but it was awesome.

I was robbed of $10 due to false advertising.<br/><br/>That said, it must be mentioned that there were no redeeming qualities in this film. The CGI was messy, the acting was of high-school stage-production quality, and frankly, I was disgusted, even by the ""straight"" scene of Alexander and his wife on their wedding night.

And it occurred to me that whereas millions of dollars and a cast of millions can generate a lousy film, the best film of this year has, in effect, only two characters in it -- ""Before Sunrise"". <br/><br/>Stone's film also revived a memory of another Alexander treatment, the one with Richard Burton as the Macedonian conqueror. It wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but I do recall one scene that was better than any in Stone's version: Burton's Alexander had his soldiers intermarry with the women in the countries they conquered.

What an overlong, overblown, overbearing piece of odoriferous offal that was! The editing was apparently done at random, the pacing ponderous, the characters completely unsympathetic, the storytelling weak. Anthony Hopkins' droning narrative served only to remind us -- for three friggin' hours! -- that film is *supposed to be* a visual medium. Show us, don't tell us! The battle scenes, which should have been a strength here (Platoon was brilliant in this area), were a jumbled mess of quick cuts and shaky-cam shots of blood spurting with no sense of what strategy was being employed or how Alexander could have defeated an army six times the size of his own by employing superior tactics. The fighting never moved the story forward, and any dialogue uttered during the battles was completely lost in the sound mix. (Lest you blame the theater, know that I saw this at the Dolby Labs screening room.) Not only that, but what dialogue was comprehensible often seemed to have been spoken by refugees from Braveheart. As my DGA host and good friend MK put it, it was a ""turgid, stinking pile of crap."" Exactly that."
"bitcetc","3","1","3","20 November 2004"," Alexander- ""Stoned"" to Death
","My hopes were great for this film. What a cast and what a story! One of the most significant figures in history, a compelling and charismatic leader and magnificent military strategist whose personal courage was legendary in his own day, perhaps one of the first true ""internationalists"" in history, educated by Aristotle---- how could this possibly fail to be one of the most fascinating historical epics of recent memory? <br/><br/>Alexander's back story was brilliantly suited for the rising tension and paranoia Oliver Stone brought to the screen so well in ""JFK"". Even if you couldn't agree with Stone's version of ""history"" in that movie, you had to be affected by mounting apprehension and suspicion. <br/><br/>With the murderous war between Olympia, Alexander's mother, and Philip of Macedonia, the father who so strongly influenced him and who paved the way for his world-conqueror son as the backdrop for Alexander's youth, the themes of suspicion and violent intrigue could have carried the film emotionally through Alexander's own death just before his thirty-third birthday. Or themes of triumph about greatness could have made the movie inspiring. <br/><br/>Instead, the film is emotionally flat, killed in the first five minutes by a tedious and unnecessary monologue by Anthony Hopkins (mis-used terribly) as Ptolemy, the historian, describing the greatness of Alexander as a leader, and telling us he's dead. Where was the editor of this film?!? Don't tell us; show us!!! In fact, so many of the significant events of Alexander's life occur off-screen (the murder of his father, for example, rumored to have been engineered by his scheming mother) and are simply told to us by Ptolemy, that the movie never achieves any emotional traction at all. It is tedious and boring, and WAY too long. One of the best comments I've seen: ""Come back, ""Troy"", all is forgiven.""<br/><br/>There are films which you don't like because the film isn't to your taste; then there are movies which are just bad movies. This is a bad movie: a truly awful script, a complete waste of some talented actors, and direction so awful that the audience was laughing during the (very, very few) moments of supposed high drama and tension. The CGI portions of the battle scenes were amateurish, and other CGI effects were garish and distractingly inconsistent. Perhaps Stone is trying to get away from the too-realistic depiction of wars and battles from recent years. If so, he succeeded beyond his wildest hopes.The ""eagle's eye view"" of one battle has frequently been better done by ""Beastmaster"", Warner Brothers' middle-of-the-night TV comic book/sci-fi/mythology adventure series. In one scene it was evident that someone was holding the eagle.<br/><br/>Beyond ""film flubs"", this movie is a quilt work of cinematographic mistakes. The prosthetic device that covers Val Kilmer's eye to indicate the one-eyed Philip of Macedonia later shows up on another character. Similarly, an elaborate and unique headpiece worn by a Babylonian princess reappears on a woman in Asia. There are too many ""flubs"" to detail, but the fact that I noticed them in the first viewing of this film (and I am not typically this critical at a first viewing) is an indication of how little else was going on in the story. When Alexander marries a woman who looks amazingly like his mother (but I know Angelina Jolie, and believe me, she's no Angelina Jolie), the camera work done to show us the similarity is so heavy-handed that you can almost hear Stone screaming through his megaphone: ""See, she looks like his mother, you morons!""<br/><br/>As much as I enjoy watching Colin Farrell, I felt bad for him being the lead in this movie. He seems an obvious choice, capable of exuding much power, but the script doesn't serve him well. Val Kilmer brings some energy to the screen as Philip of Macedonia, even if he is portrayed as mostly a drunken lout. Only Angelina Jolie fares well. She mesmerizing holds the camera, and somehow convinces us she is Alexander's devious mother, which is a feat in itself. Connor Paolo, as the young Alexander, did a wonderful job, and his scene taming Bucephalas, the legendary war horse, was perhaps one of the few which demonstrated the qualities within Alexander that made him ""The Great"". Farrell wasn't given any of those scenes to do; Hopkins as the historian described them for us.<br/><br/>Don't be either drawn in or put off by the hype about the depiction of Alexander's alleged homosexual love affairs with his childhood friend Hephaestion or the Persian slave Bagoas. There are some moist-eyed looks and some hugs, and perhaps half-a-dozen lines referring to the relationships in the first two hours of the movie. It is falsely generated controversy, designed to stir up interest in a movie which doesn't establish any emotional bond with its audience. In my opinion, we should be far more concerned about the fact that the sex scenes with women are violent rapes. The second one, on Alexander's wedding night, designed to be dramatically overwrought, however, drew laughs from the audience because it was just so badly directed. <br/><br/>This is a big budget fiasco. Rent ""Ishtar"", and save your money. Or wait until it comes out on DVD, rent it, and use it as a drinking game with your friends. Even better, let's see what Baz Luhrmann does with the story next year, or what Ilya Salkind's version looks like. I hadn't realized until this movie that Alexander was ""Stoned"" to death.

","Talk, talk, talk... is this an action film or a documentary? There was so much being said, too many people talking without doing, and discussing things the audience is guaranteed to have no clue about. The action that actually happened was disjointed - if you're expecting an epic you'll be disappointed. It's not much more than a collection of adventures in one man's life, certainly not an epic tale of a hero uniting the known world. They didn't show a lot of story in the movie, but instead had gaps between major battles or campaigns filled in with an old man reminiscing about how great Alexander was. <br/><br/>The action that did come often left me completely lost, or completely disgusted. Major overuse of blood and gore. It jumped back and forth a lot, often with no seeming purpose. He would go here, go there, go everywhere, and you would have no idea how he got there or why anyone was reacting the way they did. Three hours is not too long for a movie, but it's too long when the scenes are being wasted on talk completely unrelated to the rest of the movie, or long drawn-out scenes stretching a few seconds of action into ten minutes of people walking around trying to be meaningful to pompous music.<br/><br/>The one thing I liked was that it did a fantastic job of portraying a very human Alexander, beset by very human concerns, and making him very easy to relate to. There weren't any glaring historical errors that I noticed. You couldn't help but like him, even if he did have some ridiculous statements and do the most ridiculous things. Despite trying to conquer and kill everyone, he still managed to convince himself, and almost convince the viewer, that his was a noble quest to free and unite all the peoples. But overall, in terms of outstanding performances, Angelina Jolie stole the movie for me. I was a lot more attracted to her than any of the males in the movie (I'm female). Her performance was superb and definitely held up an otherwise shaky movie. <br/><br/>I have no intention of seeing this again (I saw it for free a week before it comes out), and wouldn't recommend spending eight bucks on this movie, but it's worth renting when it comes out on DVD."

","Alexander is easily the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. It is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The story line is hard to follow, the acting is beyond terrible, and the cinematographer should be exiled. Oliver Stone could have TRIED to make one of the greatest generals in history look more ridiculous, but I don't think he could have succeeded. The characters are flat and unbelievable. Some of the action is shown in fast-forward, which is very strange because it's jerky enough that you know it's sped up, but not so jerky that it seems like the viewer was supposed to be able to tell it's sped up. Also, some of the camera work is just way too whimsical for a movie about an ancient general. There's one shot during a triumphal procession where the camera zooms in on Alexander's head and whips around while confetti falls and twinkly music starts playing. It's utterly laughable. This movie is so awful that not even Anthony Hopkins could save it. Not only is it bad, it's incredibly long. When I saw it, the theater was cleared before the screen even faded to the credits.<br/><br/>That said, run -- do not walk -- to see this movie. I think that all Americans need to see Alexander so that each and every one of us can know without a doubt what a bad movie is. You cannot comprehend how awful this movie is from my review because the world has never seen anything like it before. You need to see it for yourself."
"hasseily","Null","1","3","17 November 2004"," This is a drama, not a feel-good action movie!
","Well someone already gave a scathing review of the movie. That's one way to look at it, and it's quite understandable if you're expecting another Troy (shame!) or Gladiator (nicely made action). However, Alexander is NOT an action movie. I repeat, this is NOT an action movie. If you want an action movie, go somewhere else. This movie is a real true-to-form epic drama which does include action. But it is primarily a drama, that tries to be historically accurate (I cannot vouch for it), and that certainly succeeds in sucking emotion out of the viewer as a true drama should.<br/><br/>It is long and starts slowly, but I presonally didn't feel the length as it builds up well, in multiple unpredictable waves. There's no ""cool, in 5 minutes he's gonna kick this guy's ass"" moment. And every victory has its share of failures, nothing is black and white, as is any real story. Alexander is clearly 100% Oliver Stone, with all the complexity and emotion of his previous movies.<br/><br/>Alexander is also showcases Oliver Stone's genius for fight scenes. They are powerful, violent, bloody, confusing, but with some order in the chaos. It makes them real. They're not the beautifully orchestrated perfect battle scenes of Gladiator, but you'll remember them long after you forget Gladiator's battles. Think Saving Private Ryan. The editing of the battle scenes is excellent, on par with Gladiator's as well.<br/><br/>Finally, after so long, here's one Hollywood epic that is not cheesy. The spoken lines in Alexander feel natural and flow well.<br/><br/>Overall, I very much appreciated this movie. But it's certainly not for those looking for a feel- good special effects bonanza."

","Saw a screening of Alexander tonight and wish that I could have my 3 hours back. Worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. Perhaps if they're looking to make a grand entrance when this movie opens, they should stop previewing it. Honestly, don't do it. It's pretty sad that a group of decent actors couldn't pull it together... although maybe it wasn't entirely their fault. Oliver Stone may have hit rock bottom with this one. You'll probably find yourself checking your watch every few minutes for... oh... the entire second half of the movie, as the first half alone felt like 3 hours... And lastly, I wasn't alone on this one. There were about 1,000 Ivy League students who agreed with me, based on their reactions to various scenes throughout the movie. Save your time and money, go to McDonalds, watch Gigli, do anything but see this movie."
"Captain_Couth","9","2","10","28 August 2005"," The Cinema of Oliver Stone: Alexander.
","Alexander (2004) was a near perfect dramatic recreation of the life Alexander the Great of Macedonia. Oliver Stone spent a lot of time, money and effort to bring a somewhat accurate depiction of the life and times of one of the greatest military minds of all time. This is not GLADITOR or TROY. Keep this in mind. People have slammed this movie for wasting money and no making it back when it was released in the United States. Obviously the money was well spent. The scenery, sets and costumes reflect that in great detail. I also loved the way the marble statues were painted (just like in real life) and how realistic Alexander's body armor looks so much like the way it does in his mosaics.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell stars as Alexander, a complex and conflicted individual who's torn between trying to win his father's respect and his mother's love. Val Kilmer was perfect as King Philip of Macedonia but Angelina Jolie was questionable (but still hot) as Alexander's mother. Jared Leto co-stars as Farrell's best friend and lover. Rosario Dawson (filled out and looking lovely) as his Asiatic bride. The film is bookended by Anthony Hopkins who guest starred as Ptolemy the elder. Filled with two great battle scenes and a lot of drama and excess. You want to know more about Alexander the Great and watch a very good bio-pic? Grab a copy of Alexander today!<br/><br/>Despite a few liberties with reality and some actors miscasts in their roles, this is a great movie. I don't know why people have problems with the homosexual overtones. Hey, it's part of the man's life. Oliver Stone sought out the best historians who could find to work on this production. An epic film filled with beautiful imagery, realistic battle scenes and great direction.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"doktordoom","9","2","10","21 August 2005"," History lesson par excellence
","First of all I'm really disappointed with the ratings this film has on IMDb, and therefore I would like to add few of my own opinions. As one can see from my rating I have found this movie enjoyable to watch. Probably the reason for such opinion is my passion toward historical movies - though it wouldn't be an only criteria to judge it. Alexander is a historical movie that's right - rather accurate depiction of known facts about this great commander. Sometimes it tends to over-exaggerate with certain aspects or characters in Alexander's life (Olympia, heterosexuality), but it is a fairly credential projection of well documented fragment of history. It is obvious that much of the footage was cut during the montage to make a movie with a reasonable length but still characters and their motives are believable. They are not just 2D sprites hovering over the screen and reciting their scripts giving the viewer feeling it is watching a C-grade theater show. They have their plausibility in what they say. This remark is somehow connected to some other recently shot Historical Epics - namely Troy and King Arthur (both of them movies of catastrophic quality) and somewhat less Kingdom of Heaven (half-way between Troy and Alexander). It is obvious that there are two groups of viewers and reviewers when speaking of Alexander. One that speaks highly of the movie (including myself) and other that is deeply disappointed in the movie. As I have already mentioned, rarely have I seen a great movie with such a disastrous rating and therefore I was obliged to write my first review as a landmark to some doubtful potential viewers not to miss this epic. It is a great movie, far from being perfect. It is the movie that will stay in your head even after you've finished watching it - it will send you into voyages over the net just to find out more facts about the greatest commander ever. It is a history lesson par excellence."

","First of all I would like to say this is an amazing movie! Oliver Stone succeeds to bring the Hellenic civilization back to life. People who say this movie is boring are so wrong!! This film has fascinated me from begin till end. Stone aims his eyes on nature, he films the sky/the woods a lot. The beautiful nature and cities (Babylon) are the best parts of this film. The two battles are certainly the best I have EVER seen! In the first battle is the eagle very cool, and the second, it is beautiful how fast the camera moves, till the Ucefallus-jump to that elephant! A Matrix Battle, but 2300 years ago... Emotional, this film is also GREAT! The conflicts between Alexander, his father and his mother, as watcher, you experience them all like you are in the room yourself! The nudity-scene is pure emotional and it shows us how it was, out there. Yes, Alexander the Great was g*y, but so what? What difference does it make? It was normal in that time, and I'm glad that Oliver Stone faces that...<br/><br/>One of the Greatest ever! A Classic! Congratulations, Oliver Stone!"
"Mr_Nitro666","10","2","10","24 March 2005"," Very Good
","Hello, I saw this movie 3 times now, and I can say it's real good...but in first place people should be aware of who Alexander the great was. That's the main problem with people giving bad scores I think. Nowadays there's an attitude about bringing down all kinda myths and just judge them by their very external looks, which is a shame. Kids all around could say that a Nobel prize winner is crap cos he doesn't play cool in certain areas, and the bad news is that adult ppl do it too; they consider just what they are told to consider (ie. 'this is a movie with a gay hero') and have no brain(education really) to dig out their own critiques and ideas. Lots of this behavior is due to the big guys (Corps and alike) trying to dumb down overall education and especially trying to uproot the common sense of people which would often lead to fair and correct evaluations. Instead they implant a politic of fear and ignorance which actually enslaves and creates a mass of hysteric and obsessed animals. I could go on but this is not the right place.... back to the movie... critics: well from a strict 'entertainment' point of view this movie is not very good, it's more a documentary about Alexander...and doesn't have a real intriguing plot. But doing so, it fortunately abandon the way to the typical 'american movie' in which everything becomes the usual cheap history with nice explosions and sfx. In my opinion Stone should have pushed the thing lots farther apart, skipping even some battle parts and depicting instead a deeper character of Alexander, the real cool part about Alexander vision was his conviction about being a god himself...all the deeper philosophy/religious part is the real deal, and what made him not to come back home, in the movie this is completely skipped... hmm....the score by Vangelis is _awesome_....jumped up my top 3 scores of all times....finally someone who doesn't put those ridiculous flutes 'a la J.Horner' in all romantic parts...which is a 'must' in all movies after titanic and I really damn hate that sound:) well...there are more things that could be said...but I gotta work now:)<br/><br/>regards.."

Angelina Jolie's accent could perhaps have been slightly more perfected, but except from that... She was amazing. She gave the character Olympias a completely new face. A better one. The art direction is exquisite! The scenes makes you dream. You really wish you were there to feel the breeze, to smell the air, to touch the sand. And Colin... WOW! He took classes in leadership actually, and they paid of. He could almost have been the great Alexander himself. <br/><br/>(May contain Spoiler!) And now, to the one thing most people who didn't enjoy this movie reject to; the homosexuality. Yes, Alexander was a bisexual. And no, the movie is not full of gay porn where did you even get that idea?! It contains a few hugs and a kiss, is that too much? Come on! This is ancient Greece! The love between two men were... Beautiful! THAT was the true love. The love between a man and a woman? No. A man had to have a woman to pass his family name on. A woman was a machine to give him sons. Face it. A man was worth everything, and a woman just..was not. Because of this, naturally love between to men, saying the love between two of those who were worth something, was far more beautiful. And how is it that we can fill our films with sex scenes that aren't even important, while a few hugs and one single kiss can cause a riot? Just because it was between two males. Even though this was such an important part of the legend...<br/><br/>Yes, I understand that people who object to homosexuality do not wish to view one of the greatest warriors we know as a bisexual.<br/><br/>But please, grow up.<br/><br/>And see this brilliant film!!!"

Critics may complain about the currently frowned upon morals portrayed in this film, but how exactly are they different from now? It is Human (or male): love, war, sex, companionship, family and most important of all: honour & courage - ask the modern critics what their 'morals' are exactly..!

","I have just returned from watching one of the best movies I have ever seen, regardless of the historical period but easily the best ancient history epic! Stone's direction was near perfection; the cinematography by Pieto was faultless as was the acting and the music and the casting and the effects-if you think I love this film, you are right.<br/><br/>Did I think that the film was an accurate portrayal of the events, as we know them-YES! Will I ever see a better depiction of events that took place in fourth century BC-NO! I also will take bets that this film may very well go down the same gurgler as Michael Cimino's, ""Heaven's Gate""-perhaps the best western yet made. I have purposely not read anything about this film except faint media rumblings about it's unsuccess at the box but no more than that. I don't know why it was disliked but none of that negativity could or should be directed to Stone. His images were totally absorbing from the opening credits-which, by the way, were superb. After sitting through them, I was hooked and the camera work just took me in deeper and deeper.<br/><br/>The first battle scene against the Persian army under Darius should be a text book presentation about how to film ancient combat. This was followed at the end of the film by an even more remarkable battle between the Greeks and an Indian army with elephants-as accurately portrayed as it could possibly be. I am aware of society's abhorrence of cruelty to animals but in all my years of watching films, this morning was the first time that I have ever seen animals looking like moving pin cushions. That must have been the way battle was in ancient war-just a bit of Stone's eye for detail.<br/><br/>By all means see this movie if for no other reason than to see the director's shot selection as well as Prieto's camera work-a brilliant combination!"

","After seeing so many bad reviews of this movie, I was a bit nervous as I headed to the theater to see it. But I was determined to see it, both because critics are so often wrong, and because Alexander is my absolute favorite historical figure.<br/><br/>Believe me, if they screwed up Alexander, I would be more unhappy than anyone! I was worried they would pull some cheap trick like Troy, massively altering the characters to make the story more Hollywood-friendly.<br/><br/>I was VERY pleasantly surprised!!! I was completely engrossed in the movie for the entire 3 hours! I was so into the movie, I would have gladly sat through another hour or two! I liked the way they used Ptolemy narrating to condense the story into the time span of a 3 hours movie. It was an excellent idea. Granted, I would've liked to see a lot of the part flushed out more, but the movie was already at the maximum length that American movies ever seen to hit. I'm hoping for an extended version on DVD, or at least a lot of deleted scenes! All the actors were fantastic! I really got into every character. I hardly noted these supposed ""accent problems"" that were so ragged upon by critics.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was the stunning chemistry between Colin Farrel and Jared Leto. In the end, I agreed with Stone's artistic choice to never show them together in a love scene, or even kissing. It really emphasized the true love and bond between them. There was so much between their two characters that you could just feel it when they looked at each other.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this movie! I haven't seen a movie of this caliber since ""Interview with the Vampire"" or ""Dragonheart"". Fantastic epics are so rare in the cheesy popcorn world of modern movies! I plan on buys this movie on DVD the second it comes out, and, hopefully, catching it a few more times in second run theaters. I highly recommend it! However, I would advise becoming basically familiar with the story of Alexander the Great before seeing the movie; that way, you won't have to worry about figuring out the historical elements and can just sit back and enjoy this masterpiece."

"magratk","8","2","11","15 January 2006"," Good work
","I liked this. I do think it needed a hard edit. But it's one of the only historical epics I've seen that wasn't teeming with errors, and the overarching story was great. Alexander became a god. He deified his horse. He was both well versed in the mythic traditions of his people, and in the hard, rational traditions. He was one of the greatest strategists ever. He changed what it meant to be a king. And this movie actually makes a nuanced exploration of these things. With some perky social commentary, which does a great job of showing power expressing itself in predictable tropes. <br/><br/>I loved the use of the cave paintings to give mythic exposition, and the use of flashbacks to them to tie the story to the myth as the movie unfolded. The use of Alexander's deified horse to represent his own shadow; the Hellenic Golden Boy who could integrate his own shadow. <br/><br/>There were some sour notes. The ""freedom"" thing was a distracting anachronism. Alexander was fighting for a lot of things: power, security, to best his father, to please his mother, to get away from his mother, to become a new Achilles, to bring a new organizing principle to the world . . . but not freedom as we mean it today. Colin Farrell spends entirely too much of the movie looking like he's wandered in from a re-make of Spinal Tap. And there was too much exposition, though it softened the blow that Anthony Hopkins was the one giving it. <br/><br/>I understand why the movie isn't widely loved. It's a very hard film. The family drama, the extremely graphic violence, the Oedipal undertones (overtones?), the explicit bisexuality, the sheer number of characters (I finally had to bring up Wikipedia to track them all), the non- linear story telling, the lack of a standard story arc, the disturbing parallels to the current situation in Central Europe, the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, all make it a hard movie to follow and sometimes even to watch. But it's quality film-making that completely blows Troy out of the water. Well worth watching."

"filipemanuelneto","4","1","4","16 September 2017"," Visually great, but full of presumption, bad acting and with a script too short for its lengh.
","As a historian, I believe that Alexander III of Macedonia (whom we know as Alexander the Great) was so essential for the course of human history that he achieved, by his own merit, a permanent place in the list of ten or fifteen most decisive personalities always. A very exclusive list of personalities who, for good or bad reasons, have forever changed our world's history. Personalities like Jesus Christ, Julius Caesar, Gengis Khan, Albert Einstein, Adolf Hitler, Cleopatra, Shakespeare, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Galileo Galilei, Darwin, Napoleon, George Washington or Picasso... heroes or villains in an always subjective list, but it's impossible to think what the world would look like without them, isn't it? So it is with Alexander. But I'm not here to talk about this historical personality, just the movie. An intense epic that seeks to be faithful to the known facts of the life of this conquering, narcissistic, megalomaniac, homosexual and deeply complex king. This story begins at the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and follows, recounting childhood, youth and ascension to the throne through flashbacks.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the film interesting and enjoyable, even though it wasn't good. The script is historically accurate, at least in general. Of course there are exaggerated or buzzing scenes for dramatic purposes. The problem is that, even so, its a vague script and doesn't justify three and a half hours lenght. It would have been better if the post-production and editing work had cut about forty-five minutes. Another problem I felt was excessive grandeur. I know it's an epic movie, but it's possible to be epic without being presumptuous and this movie was a show of self-importance. This can be seen in the actors' theatrical and affected manners, a bunch of peacocks displaying their feathers all the time. This heroic spirit impregnated also Vangelis soundtrack, probably one of the worst he already made. I still felt difficulties with all those flashbacks. A narrative so loaded with advances and retreats seems more like a tango. They are useful, no one doubts, but sometimes it took a long time for me to realize that I was watching a flashback, and it makes everything more tiresome and confusing.<br/><br/>The film is loaded with great actors but none of them shone for lack of a competent script and director. Colin Farrell was boringly heroic and should have kept his hair dark because the real Alexander would NEVER have been blonde. The way this actor behaved was erratic and dialogues were theatrical and full of pompous sentences. Angelina Jolie is a casting error, she was too young for the character and seemed constantly younger than her own son. Val Kilmer was OK as Phillip, with a generous dose of make-up for making him older and scarred. Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer were both well, but there wasn't much for them here. Jared Leto was terribly bad, and his effeminate character was already boring enough. Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, John Kavanagh and other actors were OK as supporting but had no individual brilliance.<br/><br/>On a technical level, the film is flawless. CGI is excellent and gives us some truly beautiful scenes, such Babylon or several battle scenes. Battles are spectacular and full of action, steroids, adrenaline and epic spirit. Cinematography is loaded with warm, intense yellow and red colors, and this sometimes tires our eyes a little, but it's beautiful. Costumes are very detailed and well made. Oliver Stone worked hard on these points and succeeded, but it was the bad script, the actors wooden performances, the erratic narrative and an unpleasant presumption that defeated this film."

The problem started in Anthony Hopkins' little racist and historically inaccurate mnemonic garden, situated in Egypt of course, and decorated by Rider Haggard. As this little tableau is supposed to be what Europe was to become more than what it was, the historical anachronisms are a given, and every stereotype is included.<br/><br/>In this 19th Century American fantasy, Black people (literally) bow their heads to the wisdom of the broad-sculled Greeks. Didn't 'Old Ptolemy' know that, as Plato wrote in the Timaeus, the Egyptian priests called the Greeks ""but children in the mysteries""? And who is taking notes (literally) from this wise, Nordic Greek, but an Italian scribe (the Romans).<br/><br/>Then, there are the scores of *blond* Greek children, enthusiastically playing at killing each other, like so many Hitler Youths.<br/><br/>Alexander's mother is a dark skinned Greek, and therefore brilliant but fiery and emotionally unstable. His father Philip, played by a heavy set Val Kilmer, looks like Little John in Robin Of Sherwood, always drunk or ready to fight, or both. Top of the morning to you too, Phil.<br/><br/>This is the Herrenvolk/master race reading of Greek history, where Greece was first populated by blonde, Viking like invaders from the Northeast.<br/><br/>The historical inaccuracy of including the Lighthouse of Pharos (not completed until the reign of Ptolemy II), likely for rhetorical purposes, has been mentioned elsewhere.<br/><br/>The thing with mnemonic gardens is that they are supposed to become part of your memory, indelibly inscribed for future use.

"Ricimer","7","1","4","23 January 2005"," Incredibly Historically accurate and well acted but poorly directed.
","In contrast to ""Troy"", ""Alexander"" is more historically accurate, but poorly directed.<br/><br/>""Troy"" condensed the Trojan War down to a matter of weeks, and poorly characterized most of the main players. Homer was even handed in his treatment of both sides, but in Troy Aggamemnon is stereotyped as ""bad"" (though he wasn't that good in the epic either) and kill him off because ""the bad guy must die"", not taking into account that other Greek epics have him as a character. Menelaus is a character in the later Oddysey, but they kill him off. Paris suffers from Orlando Bloom; Bloom tried to play him well, but the writers were making him to ""good"" when he's more of a mixed character. Still the worse acting and least accurate part of the story was Achilles; reviews proudly present him as the ""conflicted, brooding hero""; but this is a 20th century anti-hero. This is the exact opposite of what Achilles is like in the epic, where he's a larger than life bold character. This was Brad Pitt not playing Achilles, but playing Brad Pitt. Eric Bana as Hector carried the movie.<br/><br/>""Alexander"" seems to have fixed some problems that occurred with Troy, but many times to a fault. Troy took many liberties with the source, but Alexander is *very* historically accurate (of course, the Trojan War is semi-legendary while Alexander lived during recorded history, but Troy could have been more faithful to Homer's work). Anyway, the film stands as a great biopic, accurately portraying what happened in Alexander's life, and not trying to glamorize any of it or moralize too much (this is not the popcorn flick that Troy was).<br/><br/>The hands down worst element of this movie is the directing. The Battle of Gaugamela is one of the greatest battles in history. Here, the director decided that to show ""the chaos of battle"", he would fill the screen with dust....so much dust that it impossible to see the battle. Untold millions must have been spent on the CGI effects for this scene, but one gets the impression that they took this image then covered over it with a thick dust cloud so you can barely make out what's happening. I watched a show about Alexander on the History Channel which visually represented the entire battle better than this film did, which is a shame because they actually did meticulously recreate all of the period armor and weapons. They don't really try to show how brilliant Alexander's tactics were. You might say that that would be impossible for a film to do for a mainstream audience, but the History Channel show I saw explained the whole thing in under 4 minutes and did it more clearly (the film does try to explain what's happening, when Alexander lays out the order of battle in his tent, but after that there's so much dust you can't see anything).<br/><br/>Further, at the Battle of Hydaspes River in India later in the film, the director's choices become truly bizarre. At the end of the battle the film becomes *surreal*. The sky turns red and colors shift so it becomes a color palette of basically white and red (image red trees, red outlines, sort of like a weird photo-negative). And Alexander is carried off the battlefield on his shield with his arms spread like Christ on the cross. There is one major problem with all of this.....Alexander the Great won the Battle of Hydaspes. It was a smashing victory. He was not carried off the battlefield. The Indian commander was laid before his feet in triumph. Alexander's army was *never* defeated in his entire career. Also, Bucephalus died of old age, not a battle wound.<br/><br/>The one truly bizarre cut is when Alexander's army refuses to go further into India, then in the next scene they fight the Battle of Hydaspes, *apparently* losing, then they return home. In reality, Alexander fought and won the Battle of Hydaspes, albeit with heavy loss, *then* his men mutinied because they didn't want to face more war elephants and other bizarre creatures of war in India.<br/><br/>Another of the bizarre choices of the directors and writers is that few historical quotes of Alexander actually survive, yet they used almost none of them. When Alexander is forced to turn back from India, he famously ""cried...because there were no more lands left to conquer"". The movie omits all of this. And when Alexander was on his deathbed, his generals asked him to choose which of them he'd give rule his empire, but Alexander shouted back ""To the strongest!"". The movie doesn't use that quote at all.<br/><br/>The actual performances by actors, however, was excellent. Even award-worthy. Colin really got into the conflicted role of Alexander and it really feels like he's playing Alexander the Great (not like Brad Pitt playing Brad Pitt instead of Achilles). The writers did a good job of keeping the characters historically accurate, and they don't do anything out of character with their real life counterparts. Though the direction on this film is ungodly. Roxanna was painfully poorly cast.<br/><br/>Bottomline: A truly great epic film can be both accurate to it's source and an entertaining film. Troy wasn't faithful to it's source. Alexander was loyal, almost to a fault as it structure the film as a biopic and less as a film with a beginning/middle/end. The director should be ashamed of the job he put in here. He is a lesser man than he once was, resting on his laurels. The writing is mixed, at times decent, at times bad, but it depends on how well the actual actors were able to salvage it. The actor performances themselves are brilliant, and Colin really poured his heart into Alexander the Great. I could conceivably see Colin nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. I could at the same time see the director nominated for a Rassie."
"dfunky","7","1","4","13 January 2005"," Some people just don't get it
","OK here is my review and also a few words on other peoples review of this film. I wouldn't class this film as an Action movie such as Gladiator or Braveheart, this is very different from them. OK it has Action sequences which are important when depicting a story of a man who won battles for a living. This film presents Alexander as more than a two dimensional character who is bloodthirsty and who is seeking revenge for something or the other. If this film was like that then it would be the same as all the other films of this genre. The film is more like a historic review of ancient times and how that society differs from that of today. The Bisexual issue comes up a lot and upsets a few people. In today's society people are led to believe that people with Gay tendencies are soft or melancholic. This is something that society has produced as a means to devalue someone if they don't fit into the norm. In past times these issues were not as important as they are today. The film actually shows zero sexual encounters involving two men. It instead depicts a different type of love, admiration or adulation that two men could enjoy in the past without society's rules condemning them.<br/><br/>People complain that Alexander is indecisive or tearful and this again deviates from the notion we have that all great leaders are Gun ho and emotionless. Maybe the reason that Alexander was a great leader was his cautious and thoughtful approach, but of course that is far to hard for action movie fans to stomach.<br/><br/>Also a few people are confused about his Macedonian origin, this has nothing to do with the modern Macedonia we know from the old Yugoslav republic.<br/><br/>I don't know the exact details of Greek history as some people do I only know bits from school and documentaries but I believe the film depicts the events reasonably, far better than other films in the past.<br/><br/>As for the rest:- Storyline - This is where people will find the most flaws as the film is more of a biopic of a man rather than a man involved in a Story that has a beginning, middle and end. Acting - Fine some parts can be wooden and others can be emphatic depends on the dialogue, Pace - for some people this film may be a bit slow, others will enjoy the history lesson and feel glad that they have actually learnt something new, Sets and Location - Brilliant its always good to see places that we can never see today even if its on a screen. Overrall - 7 Its not Breathtaking but it isn't a Bad film either. I might not watch it again but i'm glad I have seen it."

","I read the reviews saying how this was a bad movie, in fact I was surprised to see that so many critics were against it. How could a movie like this fail in so many eyes? If movies like Gladiator could do Good, why couldn't this? <br/><br/>I watched Alexander myself, wondering if what I was about to watch was going to be as bad as everyone said it would be. And, after what I saw, I have to say that most people were WRONG! Alexander is one of the better movies this year. I was more surprised by what I saw in terms of Colin Farrell playing his role well, an interesting plot, realistic battle scenes(being Indian, I loved seeing the war elephants!!!) as well as the soundtrack which seemed to fit.<br/><br/>There were some problems so I can't say it is as good as other movies I have seen recently. Angelina Jolie simply did not belong in this movie. Her character was more bothersome and the scenes that flashed back to her broke the momentum of the plot. If there was one downside to this movie, it was her.<br/><br/>Many have complained about the bisexual themes in the movie. I think Stone held back, he could have done much more with the idea, and I think he should of for historical value. I understand why he did not, so perhaps it was good he didn't. Stone should be praised for allowing such a trait in his character though, especially since it is historical.<br/><br/>I would say see this movie and ignore what people are saying."
"Aleksandar_Kare","Null","1","4","6 December 2004"," Do not twist history
","As far as Alexander being bi I think that most of the people don't understand why this is a problem. Over the deeds of Alexander right now two nations are taking ownership Greeks and Macedonians. (I am not saying that anybody is right as you will see if you continue reading.) They are both orthodox Christians and with their religious beliefs it is wrong to be gay or bi. So in their eyes Oliver Stone just did a moral crime against their cultural heritage. So you can understand the problems you cause when you hurt someone's history.<br/><br/>As to the film I think that maybe Mel Gibson would have been a better choice for director. From what I could notice in the movie Oliver Stone had some problems with history. The great battle for Persia Alexander calls his men Macedonians and then shouts ""FOR Greece""?????. If you read history books you will see that in that time there was no Greece (there was Sparta, Athens... cities states). Alexander was king of Macedonia and he led the Macedonian army that fought for Macedonia. I will stop here to avoid offending somebody.<br/><br/>For me the greatest problem is not that Alexander was presented as bi, but that that he was totally psychologically unstable, with five nervous breakdowns thought the movie and this man conquered the entire civilized world? For the end the bottom-line is that the movie was unclear, with a lot of flashbacks that were too important to be just that and in part not according to history but every effort must be valued so it is worth to watch it even if you don't like it."
"desveaux","7","1","4","4 December 2004"," Why he failed to conquer...
","After reading several reviews, I think Stone's biggest problem, is the fact, he used a real person, rather than say Maximus of Gladiator (he could have been ""Bi"" with little or no controversy). 2) The places & facts, (sometimes in dispute or the simple fact, everything he did, wasn't included!), would not been factors. 3) Many of the viewers, are unable to place themselves more than 2300 yrs. in the past & therefore, place current paradigms on this film (several writers complain of how women of ancient life were treated...well in truth... it was much worst than the movie shows.)<br/><br/>So, for good or evil, not only will this likely be Stone's last big budget film, it will also scare off many producers from doing historical epics, as well. (I went to this, knowing it was getting killed by the critics, but I Really wanted to support historical films & biographies.) So, fans of mass junk, you may have conquered the Alex the Great, but in doing so, you have supported the non-National Treasures. (Thank God for The Incredibles, though!)<br/><br/>PS: That being said, the accents, (such as Irish ones!), should not have been allowed in a high budget film, so I will lower my grade to a ""B+"" now."

The Village climbed over a hundred million domestically with some of the worst reviews and word of mouth in recent memory.

","I thought Alexander was a great movie. It was all and more of what a movie should be which is truth and not an illusion of what we want to hear to make us feel comfortable. I like this movie because it took chances with its audience by showing Alexander's passion, his ignorance, and his sexuality. All of which made him human. In movies we get feed this image that seems a bit surreal and in a Alexander it just feels so real and I'm not a historian, but from my teachers i've heard that Alexander is better historically shown than Troy(w/ brad Pitt) but yet critics beat down Alxenader and Troy was treated better. I think if you are willing to open your mind from what has been feed to you you can truly appreciate this movie and what it offers."
"DonaldX01","8","2","13","26 March 2005"," on 'asexual hypocrisy'
","to bolender-1 and others:<br/><br/>I cannot completely agree with you, although after I've read your comment fully I think its more or less compatible with my opinion. But - do you really think that relationship between Alexnader and Hephaistion was purely asexual? You are naive. And it seems homophobic too, because you consider sexual affair between men something 'dirty' (ie. not pure as heterosexual intercourse is supposed to be?) Such obvious use of double standard.. As you mention Aristotles remark on lust, he in fact said this (in the movie at least): <br/><br/>'When men lie together in lust, it is a surrender to the passions, and does nothing for the excellence in us, nor does any other excess, jealousy among them, but when men lie together and knowledge and virtue are pass between them, that is pure, and excellent, when they compete to bring out the good, the best in each other, this is the love between men, that can build the city state and lift us from our frog bottom.'<br/><br/>I don't think this means that 'sex is bad, purity means no sex' as you seem to believe. This is just about a well known fact, that if you became too indulged, it won't result in nothing but vanity. But there is nothing said about sex, in both examples, men do 'lie together' - do you really think that they only play ticktacktoe with each other or what? Or that Alexander was wanking all the way to India, and have sex only once, when he knocked up Roxana? Come on.. sexual affairs among men were common in old Greece, and were not hypocritically condemned as it was later when 'modern' totalitarian religions emerged. In fact even the basis of Greek educational system was based on more or less sexual relationship between an older/mature/wise man ('teacher') and a young one ('student'), the co called 'Pederastic pedagogy'. While now all the bigots would gone crazy just by thinking about this, it was the social norm back then. And the above mentioned Aristotle's citation is a indirect reference to this. Obviously the movie makers didn't dare to show more. And yes, this is the true reason why we don't see any real sex in the movie (except, of course, of some 'acceptable' heterosexual acts) or one(!) innocent kiss. If the movie has depicted the relationships among men more vividly, there simply wouldn't be such a film, because of the censorship!<br/><br/>All in all, I liked this movie very much anyway, it may not be the best historical movie ever, or the most innovative one, but it was definitely entertaining and it really had some 'real' and 'disturbing' feeling in it. And yes, it was way better than the 'Gladiator' or similar fictitious mass-production simplicity."

Instead he took the risqué a made it a historical film (a bit like MR R.SCOTT did with Christopher Columbus 1592). I enjoyed every 2hr.45mins of it and cant wait for it to come out on DVD.Not forgetting the musical score by Mr Vangelis.AS for the actors Anthony Hopkins was hes usual self, Val Kilmer was once again brilliant i find him to be one of the best actors around and very unrated.Colin Farrell confirms his talent more and more , MIss Tomb Raider shows she can really act!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>This is a good film take no notice of what the others say.

"suspiria10","7","1","5","8 August 2005"," S10 Reviews: Alexander (2004)
","Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell  Phone Booth) was a man of great passion. By the tender age of 25 this Macedonian king had conquerored 90% of all the known lands of that time. By the time he died (of mysterious causes) at age 33, Alexander had shaped the very destiny of the world and became immortal like the gods of Olympus.<br/><br/>""Alexander"" is probably Oliver Stone's (Natural Born Killers / Platoon) most polished film. A bit flashy at times, it lacks a bit of the manic intensity that be brings to many of his projects. Is it a bad film? No. ""Alexander"" is an exceptionally photographed film (the DVD really shines) that is very compelling and well acted. The Vangelis score was wonderful and as I stated before the photography was simply gorgeous. Although a fine cast (Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto, Christopher Plummer, Val Kilmer, etc.) Farrell seemed an odd choice for the part of Alexander but after awhile he seemed to come into his own. One does wonder if Stone could have done better for his lead. I must admit that although Miss Jolie looked stunning as ever, she too seemed out of place. My only real quibble with the film is that we only get to see two battles but the battles were immense with superb sound design. ""Alexander"" is much better than Warner's other2004 epic (Troy) but doesn't hold a candle to the ""Braveheart's"" and ""Gladiator's"" of yore."

Jumping years, skipping whole chunks of his life, made it confusing, The idea of the young Alexander speaking with the same accent was good and getting his looks the same. The elephant V's the horse scene was brilliant. And Angelina as his Mum was a good bit of casting. I go to see films to enjoy them...I do not go to see fluff.

","The film is not something can represent the condition on that time. In this film we see that Persian Empire showed extremely weak and non-civilized. However Greek culture got lots of things from the Persians and used them to grow up. Acropolis was made years after Persepolis and there were lots of statues in it, which is copied from Persian holy symbols like Lions with wind, horses with one horn and eagles. One thing I have to point here is, the Alexander was not grown up in a comfortable conditions like palace. Otherwise he could not be such a brave killer. As far as I know he was grown up between people that fighting and killing was very common. How you can expect somebody lives all of his life in palace and in battle face to an elephant?! And the reason, which caused Persian Empire defeated against him, was this. On that time Persian people were living in a very nice civilized cities in calm and peace never even could have thought of war. Persian army was made from professional bodies but it was not enough to rise against Alexander, had been having lots of men from west. And rests of people were not trained to be in battle. So what we can expect except Alexander conquer? I found the director that much unknown of history had been used one of the important Persian symbols at back name of Alexander! (This symbol was erased right after some zartoshtian people raise a stink against using it) He did not realize even this symbol belongs to Alexander enemies not something Alexander believed in it!

","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't remember how many times I've watched it by now. The actors, the attention to plot and historical accuracy...Stone has really done it well. Now I know many people, in the US especially, didn't like this movie. That's OK, I didn't like Troy -it was travesty in my opinion. But back to the movie at hand. Alexander is a complex story with lots of subplots and nuances that the original length just cannot do enough justice. Many people complained the movie was too long, to me it was not long enough. I could have stood it to be two movies instead of one just to get more of this great story.<br/><br/>All in all though -it was a very, very, very good film. I'd have given it a 10, but for the kiss-that-was-not. I mean, come on, do it or don't do it. The looks, the touches, the hugs. I swear to god there were more hugs in that movie than any I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong -I'm not against hugging, but it becomes rather painful to watch when the characters are supposed to be lovers. It's not like anyone can kid themselves about what kind of relationship between Hephaistion and Alexander that Stone wanted to portray. Couldn't he just have taken the leap for real and let the guys kiss, just once, in the whole movie? I mean even Mulder and Scully kissed in that X-files movie years ago and that was by far the most platonic relationship with sexual undercurrents I'd ever seen on screen. Never mind the fact that Farrel/Leto kissing would be hot, I'm not going to lie and say it wouldn't, but that's actually besides the point. What is the point is that two lovers, in private, do not simply share hugs all the time. Especially after having declared their undying devotion to each other (think the balcony scene, where Hephaistion even vexes on lyrically about Alexander's physical features), it's simply ridiculous. It's not like the movie was ever going to be mainstream popular anyway, maybe actually having a kiss would even have afforded it some (additional) respect.<br/><br/>But enough about the loving or lack of it. As I said -it's a great movie with great actors. Anthony Hopkins is a wonderful story teller and a great way of progressing this epic story. (Because really, how long would it have had to be if we didn't have a narrator?) Angelina Jolie's powerful portrayal of Olympia is very (I've already overused the word I know) nice. She's a strong willed woman in a difficult position, a product of the times, but not willing to just be the trophy wife, wanting something more. She's fiercely protective of her son, which is understandable. Alexander is also her insurance, as long as he's alive and safe in the succession order she's relatively safe as well. There are some Oedipal tendencies in the story, but I honestly can't tell if it's intentional or if it's just Farrel/Jolie on screen at the same time that does it. Val Kilmer makes for a wonderfully human king Philip. He's a hard man with many faults, but he's also a product of the times and circumstances and in his own way he tries to be the best man he can be, that he can bear to be. Farrel as Alexander was pure genius. So what if (it led to?) the whole cast was speaking with Irish accents, it's not like they could speak ancient Greek after all. The mixture of softness, charm and intelligence with a violent temper as well as the natural petulance afforded any young man at that age with that upbringing was very well done indeed. Jared Leto as Hephaistion, well what can I say, Stone lucked out with that one. Leto IS Hephaistion, everything clicks, it's that simple. The quiet strength, the careful challenging of Alexander's ideas at every turn while still being utterly supporting. Beautiful, simply stunning. Roxanne (I'm sorry I don't remember the name of the actor even though she's very good)is fierce and beautiful and hard, like a mountain princess is supposed to be. She knows what's going on and she's not happy with her place, but she knows it could be a whole hell of a lot worse.<br/><br/>The battles, there are two and in my opinion that's all we need. We get what's going on after all. There could be more, I wouldn't mind it, as long as it didn't take time away from the actual plot. Are they very great looking? Well no, they could be better, but they're not exactly bad either.<br/><br/>If you didn't get it, let me just reiterate -I love this movie. It's a fantastic movie. As long as you watch the original and not the second 'director's cut', which was, yeah new heights of pathetic, talk about being ruled by opinion. It's about the only director's cut I've ever heard of where the end result is actually SHORTER than the original. Tragic. I AM however looking forward to the third cut which Mr. Stone promised would be how HE wanted it to look instead of being swayed by critics and popular opinion. Here's to hoping he includes a kiss. According to an interview I read with Farrel (in a European magazine) there actually were scenes like that shot. ^o^ I don't have a lot of faith, but...I do have a great deal of hope."

But such highs! <br/><br/>Gaugamela: much much more exciting than the boring PBS ""footsteps of Alexander"" (own it) showing the dusty plains and the dry river bed where King Darius was killed. Remember, this was Alexander's defining moment, the spear poised at Darius' head, immortalized in the million tile mosaic on the Pompeian floor....Thank god Stone remembered to use the horned helmet that even modern Persians remember Iksander by.<br/><br/>Babylon: Absolutely stunning recreation, yes, despite the usual digital fancifulness. Stone admits it was all ""guess work"" and at least he had the requisite British historian consultant in tow to try to conceptualize a lost realm.<br/><br/>The Ishtar (lapis lazuli blue tiled) Gate is magnificent! Imagining Alexander's march into the city is much easier now, and must have been 10 times as powerful in real life...So many paintings since the birth of Christ have tried recapturing that moment, now we have it on film, thanks! <br/><br/>Don't forget that the damn big terraced palace was dutifully recreated; the Persians of old had it good! Oh, and don't think that the flag waving over Alexander's' Babylonian bedroom is a portrait of Darius' due to the bearded figure; that is the god Marduk with his winged disk. ;-) <br/><br/>Issus, Bactria, India: Less exciting to be sure, but the movie sublimely shifts focus on internal strife in the army's ranks over the long years of campaign, and it is refreshing to see how scarred, lamed, and tired the army looks near the end. That's good. Fresh clothes and faces are not reality.<br/><br/>Collin Farrell (spelling?) is a trip to watch in the features section of the DVD; he swears and swaggers like a real Alexander! Magnificent! Too many historians called Alexander a drunk savage; we Greeks can overlook a little drink and savagery if it lets you conquer the known world by the age of 26. And a nice touch was showing how ""barbarian"" cultures were assimilated, not annihilated, by Alexander for the first time in history.<br/><br/>Bravo Collin for doing some justice to an honorable story. And no, Oliver Stone is not a has been like he depreciatingly remarks about in the features.

"jgrosas33","10","1","6","21 July 2006"," A valiant attempt thats worthy of note
","This film, a film that dares if you will, to go against the mainstream of this specific genre, is in my opinion a worthy attempt, with a good deal of passion thrown into a project which, despite all its foibles and problems comes across as a worthy attempt at telling the story of the man who conquered nearly half the known world. Remember, this film is called Alexander, not Alexander the Great, and so it shows him as a man, not as this super human war fighting machine that feels no emotion. In this respect, I can greatly respect the character, for being human, like us. The battle scenes, although confusing at times, are some of the best ever filmed, the dust, confusion, cries, yells, arrows and blood, all come together to show the brutality of the wars these men fought. The acting, although at times can be suspect, the cast do a good, noble job. The Irish accents are, well....what can i say, a little off-putting and at times a little funny, but anyway, if you get passed that, your on your way to at least understanding this film! I can fully understand why people don't like this film, its long, lots of (at times) over-acting, the plot jumps around a lot and lots of touchy subjects such as sexuality and so on.<br/><br/>So, if you feel yourself to be a history buff, an intelligent person that can stand many hours of historical intrigue and action, then this is for you! (i consider myself amongst that group!) If you are into gore, blood and big explosions, do your self a favour and not see this movie. There are 2 big battles, but not enough to quench your brutal thirst for death and destruction.<br/><br/>Personally i loved the film, an epic film about real people, but to be a little unbiased, its a worthy film, but could have been done in a better way."
"blayzer_trayl","8","1","6","20 December 2005"," Not bad ...some very enjoyable scenes!
","Just recently saw it on DVD...Not a bad movie...don't know why it was panned by the critics?? Apparently is was fairly historically accurate ...and having read a little about Alexander ...the scenes do fall into order.<br/><br/>Strong emotion led performances from Val Kilmer and Colin Farrel.<br/><br/>The adoption of undisguised Irish accents by Colin and some of his co-actors made it the film seem odd and laughable at times ...maybe one of the reason why the film was criticised. According the director the accents were kept like this to portray the varying levels of ethnicity and regional identities in ancient Greek culture.<br/><br/>More valid criticisms i think was the clever dick he was portrayed as a kid (at about 12 hes talking with all the gusto of an adult!!) ...and how he tames a wild horse in presence of everyone...these are just silly scenes! Also the scene of the trek down the cave with his father looking at the wall paintings was just mundane.<br/><br/>Great visuals though ..nice cinematography ...bright and spectacular sets (to be expected from Oliver Stone) ...and battles scenes were on par with the likes Braveheart, Gladiator etc.<br/><br/>I loved the exchanges he had with his father, mother ..his commanders and other subjects. These scenes are essentially what made the film for me. Renactments that gives great insight on what motivated Alexander to do certain things in the way he historically did them.<br/><br/>The filmed liked to dwell on Alexanders upbringing and past ...so as to take a peep on what shaped him to become one the noted most greatest general of all time.<br/><br/>Some kurfuffle and controversy on the homo/bi-sexuality portrayed ....but according the historians this was normal accepted behaviour in the ancient Greek society. I think there was no big deal there really.<br/><br/>Loved the soundtrack ...but then again i loved all the previous soundtracks made by Vangelis. He is Greek himself ...so no-one more appropriate for it.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is a great director ...i love all his previous films. I think he was misunderstood on this project. But all masters do it once in a while ..Ford Copolla after-all made the film 'Jack' 'Alexander' a bit simplistic in areas but an underrated good decent film in my opinion."

The only real problem is the accents, but you can ignore that after the first few exchanges of dialogue as I did. Me, my friends, and my family all loved it. See it!! It's great, plus there's a lovely score from the superb Vangelis. Ignore everyone else, and try and see this masterpiece from Oliver Stone a.s.a.p. Even for the most numb-minded male viewer, there's two lovely ladies to look at. The soundtrack, as I say, is superb, with my favourite tracks form it being 'Young Alexander' and 'Roxane's Veil', with Vanessa Mae on the violin. It really is special.

This is one of the best films of 2004. This movie has an all star cast which includes Anthony Hopkins, Jered Leto, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and Colin Farrell. They are accurate on the time period.

"speka007","8","1","7","25 August 2005"," Very good historical account, EXCEPT description of Alexander
","I loved the film,however, I expect Oliver Stone films to provide as best as possible historical accuracy. Overall, Mr. Stone did well in the historical representations, with the exception of the physical appearance of Alexander. Stone portrayed Alexander as a tall, blond haired, blue eyed person. When in fact, the historical accounts, including a color mosaic show Alexander as a olive skinned, brown or dark haired person - in other words, he looked like a typical Medditeranean male looks today - not like a Germanic as Stone depicts. How many Greeks do you know that are 6'2"" and blond haired/blue eyed? Sounds more like the description of Arnold Schwarznegger.<br/><br/>For reference see: ""The Alexander Mosaic."" Mosaic.

","Everybody has watched many epics where the protagonist was a hero. In almost all of them, the hero is like an unbreakable man who could kill lots of enemies and fight battles as a lion. Great, this is wonderful and it fits the historical knowledge we have about them. Alexander was shown as this strong man in that wonderful film starred by Richard Burton in the 1950's.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone, however, decided to make something knew: show Alexander the Great in his human side. His life is told since his birth until his death, without leaving behind things that may be common in someone's life, like love and fear.<br/><br/>Alexander's mother is shown as a woman who always wanted her son to rule the world. She believed this would make her powerful as well. This eager for power made her try to control Alexander, who was obviously uncomfortable with it.<br/><br/>Alexander was also shown in his homosexual life (something ignored in the version with Richard Burton). This may spoil the hero symbol for some people who don't like gays...<br/><br/>But this version by Oliver Stone has lots of battles, just like this kind of movie must have. And these fights are really well done. Sometimes they are shocking because of the violence that is shown.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Val Kilmer, Christopher Plummer and Colin Farrell as the protagonist. I liked their performances a lot.<br/><br/>My rate 8/10"
"shadowxs","8","1","7","29 December 2004"," A good movie, but tom much emphasis on the gay relations
","I liked the movie a lot. The effects were great. The filming of the fight at Gaugemala was great. Historically it seemed quite correct as well, Alexander was suspected to have a love affair with Hephaistion. This was not that odd at all in that time in Greece. A century before, the older spartan soldiers had younger (18 till 21) spartan boys assigned to them as students and lovers and the Theban Sacred Band were gay elite soldiers. Herodotus even writes that greeks introduced the Persians to the pleasures of male to male sex.<br/><br/>However, the movie is emphasizing this aspect too much and is projecting Alexander as a gay who is on the lookout for beautiful boys all the time. This half an hour of movie wasted on this, should have been used to tell some more about the time before Gaugemala. The battle of the Issus is completely left out.<br/><br/>The accent Angelina Jolie puts on is ridiculous. Are all evil people speaking with Russian or German accents ? Even in ancient history ? Besides these remarks I find the movie very entertaining and historically reasonably correct."
"rcavellero","8","1","7","25 November 2004"," Alexander THE MAN...
","Oliver Stone's Epic production Alexander minus the Great part is a very fitting character piece. The film's excessive 150 million dollar budget could've been drawn down to a mere 5 million to incorporate the character growth the film represents. It's going to be quite hard for the film to find a true audience with the overly apparent gay undertones and the ultimate smallness the film requires to tell it's story. I believe people will go in expecting a big Hollywood epic and instead will receive a confused, sometimes directionless film that beautifully represents it's title character. Everyone knows the story of Alexander so there's no need to go into that aspect. But what they don't know is of him. I'm not sure how factual this story lies but it's expressed supremely realistic and is done in an artful and respected fashion. Collin Farell makes a fine and gorgeous leading man he has a bit of learning to do with the control of his emotions but otherwise gives a surprisingly moving performance. Jared Leto gives a dominating performance as Alexander's main lover and their chemistry is expressly ripe and heartful. The show stealing performance comes from generic beauty Angelina Jolie who despite her last umpteenth horrid films give a wonderfully reassuring performance of why she took home the Oscar that night. Rosario dawson is minimally entertaining as Alexander's first wife despite a laugh inducing start. The film is beautifully shot with striking cinematograpghy but sports a lame score. All things said I must say that I was overly impressed by Hollywood's bigtime gamble which from slight audience reaction won't be paid back. Alexander nonetheless stands as a true work of art a sleeper masterpiece that will find it's target audience among few who will greatly appreciate it. 10/10"

"nmiodrag","9","1","7","21 November 2004"," Dark and disturbing? Yes. Excellent movie? Yes, yes, yes!
","I saw Alexander last night on a midnight screening in Zagreb, Croatia. Even though I'd usually be fast asleep at that time the film kept me wide awake every minute of it's long three hours. Going out of the theater, my verdict was: Mr. Stone, you have two thumbs up. Why is it than that I see mostly negative reviews from the few viewers who have posted their opinions so far? Allow me explain myself and venture a few guesses about that.<br/><br/>*Spoilers start*<br/><br/>Is this film dark and disturbing? Yes, it is. But such were the times and the circumstances in which Alexander lived. The myths he grew up were dark and disturbing (which is well portrayed in the movie when young Alexander is taken to a sort of crypt by his father Fillip, and shown the wall paintings representing those myths); seeing his father rape his mother when he was a young boy was disturbing; having grown up with a mother who was constantly afraid of being killed and replaced by another queen and who had his father assassinated to avoid such fate was disturbing; being rejected by his father at age of 19 when he decided to take on another queen (a Macedonian woman unlike his Greek mother) was disturbing; seeing his father behaving lewdly with both mean and women on drunken feasts was disturbing; being convinced by his mother that he is a son of Zeus, and therefore a god, was disturbing - but such were the circumstances in which he lived.<br/><br/>There was a lot of controversy related to this film pushing some kind of ""homosexual agenda"" from mainstream Hollywood. I think this film puts homosexuality well within the context of the Greek culture. Aristhoteles explains this in the movie when teaching young Alexander, Hephaestus and their peers. The context was the myth of Achilles and his lover Patroclus, whose death he had mourned and avenged (we know that Alexander was fascinated with this mythos more than any other, and saw himself and Hephaestus in such a relationship): for a man to lay down with another man driven by lust was considered inappropriate, without any merit for the men involved in such an act, and therefore shameful. On the other hand, for two men to lie down together when they were in a relationship of mutual love, respect and edification was considered appropriate and stimulative for the culture of the time. The mythos of Achilles (which was so badly misrepresented in the recent blockbuster ""Troy"") gives a great example of this: Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, not cousins as presented in ""Troy"", and that fact was acceptable by both the culture and their gods (obviously not acceptable for the Hollywood moviemakers). There was, however, an incident by which Achilles incurred the wrath of Apollo on himself, and it wasn't the killing of the Apollo's priests or desecrating his statue (as shown in ""Troy""), but something else altogether. The old king Priam had numerous sons (about 20) with different wives, and not just Hector and Paris. One of the Trojan princes was Troilus for whom it has bean prophesized that if he lives to be 20, the city of Troy would never fall. Achilles saw the young prince and lusted after him. The prince fled to the temple of Apollo to seek sanctuary. Achilles followed the boy (who was 19 at the time) into the temple and after the boy refused to satisfy his lust, slew him right there on the Apollo's altar. That is why Apollo turned against Achilles and that's why he had to die. We find a parallel in Alexander: Alexander is portrayed as being in a love relationship with Hephaestus and he is not judged for it by his culture (although he is advised by his mother to marry and produce a successor to the throne), but only by his non-Greek wife. The film depicts the two men professing love to each other and hugging each other on numerous occasions, as well as Hephaestus massaging Alexander's neck and shoulders in one scene and giving him a ring in another, and Alexander inviting his lover to spend the night with him - none of which was unacceptable for Greek culture of the time. However, as Achilles gives into his lust, so does Alexander, as he is seduced by a male Persian exotic dancer/escort at one of the drunken feasts. The movie portrays Alexander kissing the dancer during the feast, and being tended by him the next morning when Hephaestus enters his tent to ""straighten"" him up.<br/><br/>*Spoilers end*<br/><br/>Can Mr. Stone be blamed for showing things as they were? Not in my opinion. He had courage to show what we know about Alexander's life without changing it to fit our present day (false) morality. Some may call it an ""agenda""; I call it being true to his subject (both the culture of the time and particularities of Alexander's life). Could he have done it differently? Of course. He could have altered the facts as they did in Troy, or be more discriminate as to what he chose to portray. In either case we would have not been presented by the culture of the time or the facts of Alexander's life. If this is too disturbing for you, go and see sugar-coated Troy instead. This is one of the rare movies that Mr. Stone made where there is no Star-Spangled Banner waving and pampering to the America's national pride (for which I have very little respect, being a typical European) - but showing just ugly, dirty, disturbing story of one man's life and his time. Is it strange that he is being rejected by his American audience (that so loved his ""patriotic"" movies)? No, not at all.<br/><br/>What of the other aspects of this movie? I think acting was superb, especially that of Mr. Farrell and Mrs. Jolie. Brad Pitt (whom I personally like very much) as Achilles in ""Troy"" has nothing on Mr. Farrell (who is to me convincing both as 19 year old, and as a grown-up Alexander), and Mrs. Jolie has proved to be a really good actress - other than looking simply gorgeous. <br/><br/>One thing I was annoyed by was Mrs. Jolie's accent (other accents did not bother me as much as they seamed to bother some people); since it sticks out as a sore thumb (I guess they wanted to point out her being a foreigner and not a Macedonian woman). <br/><br/>I particularly like Sir. Anthony Hopkins's aged Ptholomeus who speaks of Alexander (at the end of the movie) both with adoration and a dose of cynicism which gives him a note of reality.<br/><br/>Finally, I am amazed by the people who bash on this movie because someone has a bad hairdo?! If we are to judge movies based on the hairdo than planetary popular original Star Wars would be a total dud (being renowned for some of the worst hairdos ever seen on the silver screen) - but it isn't.<br/><br/>Is Alexander a dark and disturbing movie? Yes. Is it for everybody's taste? No. Is it a good movie? Yes, yes, yes. I give it 9/10."

I felt the cast <br/><br/>sold their roles. Thus, I was not at all distracted by the much<br/><br/>buzzed about Irish, British accents... nor the lack of age difference<br/><br/>between Colin & Angelina Jolie (Olympias, Alexander's mum) . <br/><br/>Jolie's aging process was fun to watch. Jolie came across well<br/><br/>as a strong, and loving, yet manipulative - working to keep the<br/><br/>apron strings tied. Despite his moments of wrath, Farrell's<br/><br/>Alexander exhibited vision, and conviction which would be a<br/><br/>quality men would choose to follow for a length of time, despite<br/><br/>difficulties .Others included Rosario Dawson, Val Kilmer, Jared<br/><br/>Leto. The story unfolds as a scribe records the words of an aged <br/><br/>former military man, Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins). While in fact<br/><br/>there were two massive warring scenes depicted, (one in Persia,<br/><br/>the other India), director Oliver Stone's final cut is much more an<br/><br/>attempt to look into the ""why's"" behind the man and his possible<br/><br/>motivations, rather than a running loop of battle action scenes. <br/><br/>The film is violent throughout with rapes, assassinations - yet<br/><br/>these weren't exaggerated per se to sell the film, rather part of the<br/><br/>recipe which created an Alexander. The same can be said for the<br/><br/>issue of his bisexuality Full battle scenes were graphic, complete<br/><br/>with blood, guts, gore and costumes and if any place, this is where<br/><br/>Stone went for visual impact to accurately convey the non-glorious<br/><br/>side of war. Interspersed throughout the film were moments<br/><br/>where filming techniques allowed me to move from watcher to<br/><br/>""experiencing the moment first hand,"" whether it was adulation<br/><br/>from a cheering crowd, charging an elephant, falling wounded and<br/><br/>helpless. <br/><br/>I will leave military and historical experts to dispute the accuracy<br/><br/>of timeframes or battle maneuvers. Much of this is recorded. I<br/><br/>also accept and appreciate the liberties Stone and writers took to<br/><br/>piece together an Alexander . Surrounded by strong characters<br/><br/>with strong ambitions - obviously something drove the man to<br/><br/>pursue his dream of conquering the better part of the known world. <br/><br/>(Makes me want to do some more reading on my own)."
"keesa","9","1","7","24 November 2004"," Hard to do him justice
","The movie, as far as movies go, is very very good. A lot of people seems to take things very literally, but they have to remember that it's often hard to recreate something that happened over 2000 years ago and no one had actually seen. I think that Oliver Stone did a good job portraying ancient world and the actors acted out their characters as realistically as possible. The only thing that is disappointing is that no movie can be long enough to include everything that can be said about Alexander. In order for them to keep it within acceptable time limit (for movie) they had to skip or gloss over a lot of facts and events, which in turn prevented from really showing what Alexander and those surrounding him were like. I like the movie, but to do Alexander any justice they need to make series."

","I just saw Alexander in a midnight preview. Well, what to say? I was never very good in history, but if I was asked I would say that the film shows Alexander's life in a very realistic way. For example, any other filmmaker would have shown us Alexander as a hero, flawless, a great conqueror... but he wasn't just all that. It was very brave from Stone to show us his other side, the human in him, emotions... This film could have easily become a hack and slash movie, I mean Alexander spent most of his life in war. But in these 3 hours there are only two really big battles, but when it comes to them they are not nice or heroic like in ""Troy"", no, the camera holds still on all the brutality and dirt that such battles were full of. Alexander himself is a figure of controversy, especially his love life and sexual orientation. In that aspect Stone again was very brave, showing us Alexander's love for both, men and women. This is an epic film, whether you like it or not, but one thing is for sure, this film will be discussed..."
"parislover","8","1","8","14 December 2006"," Beautiful and erotic!
","You don't know what you missed if you skip this movie. But of course, you have to be interested in ancient history and have some sense of literature. I got discouraged to rent the movie after reading so many negative comments but weird enough, I couldn't stop thinking about it and seems I trust my sixth sense more. Finally, I decided to judge myself and, I REALLY ENJOYED AND LOVED IT! Like reading a beautiful interesting history book to remember our past journey. This film was very well done in general. This is not an ""action"" entertaining kind of movie. Don't compare it with ""Troy"" of which the battles some people don't even care about. It is about Alexander's life and love, his dreams, his visions, ideals, his glory and his conflicts with reality. Colin Farrell did a good job even though he could be more polished. The casting and acting is good if not great. The story, cinematography, costumes, music, battle scenes are beautiful. The accuracy of the history was generally commented. I praise Olive Stone for his courage to make a big film about this historical great warrior. It is never easy to portray a hero's life in less than 3 hours film and have perfect focus. Stone knew the risk in critics would be ""high"" but tried the best to accomplish what we should know about Alexander. Alexander - an idealist, a dreamer, a progressive, a brave action taker. He is a great warrior, but on the other hand, he is intellectual, kind, sensitive and loving. The love between him and Hephaistion is so beautiful. How could or should anyone portraying Alexander ignore his love of life, someone shared his dreams and deeply affected his action? Alexander died eight months after Hephaistion passed away. Stone is faithful to this part too.<br/><br/>I'm so disheartened to read many low ratings, nasty comments or even hostile reaction. What issues blocked our mind and eyes? Ignorance, uninterest or carelessness about our great history? Is this movie too artsy or difficult to comprehend? Not at all. Does it need a bit patience or sense of literature? Definitely. What happened to our American culture and why can't be more objective and patient to look through the history part rather than expecting the excitement of action? And sure enough, later on I found out this film made much more money from showing oversea than in our own country. It was appreciated much more in foreign countries. Isn't it telling something? Be independent. Give a fair and balanced judgement!"

I do understand people being shocked due to the nudity and battles, but tell me this:ISN'T A BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT STILL ART, EVEN IF SOMEONE IS NAKED? WEREN'T WE BORN NAKED?

","The great Alexander is a historical movie, Alexander as you know had opened a lot of countries and one of the countries is Bahrain that I live in now.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story and the life of Alexander who had lived his life to fight for peace and the most important is to see the whole world and it's contents. I've heard in a lot of historical sources that Alexander when he was in the deathbed , he said to his followers that if he died, they must buried him but his hand should be out of the grave, just to show the world that he traveled all over it, he fought in it, he laugh in it, he did a lot of things in this world but look at the end. He has nothing but sand above him, and he got nothing, his hand just opened with nothing on it. thats the kind of a guy who understand the meaning of the world I'd say.<br/><br/>The scenario in the movie is great and well done. Wonderful special effects and the graphic made this movie look good, and the best part of this movie that many people loved and liked the scene when Alexander in the battle when he fell off from the back of his horse. Don't forget how the music was so reliable and fit the scene , as I said the music in the battle scene was the most greatest one.<br/><br/>When you see it in theater, you will forget about the time. you will look forward to see more and more about Alexander and his great attitudes. In the big screen, it worth even 30$ I'd say to watch this movie.<br/><br/>All I could say now, It's enjoyable, wonderful, great, contain a lot of life lessons and a lot of interesting scenes and battles.<br/><br/>Hope my review is useful, and sorry for my bad English."
"PersianPlaya408","8","1","8","11 August 2005"," Not as bad as what the IMDb rating and critics say...
","Let me first start off by saying this is definitely not the best historical film made, but i have seen worse. THe film has its moments, its told in a random flashback manner (present, 10 years earlier, present, 9 years earlier, and on n on...) which is a bit distracting at times. However the direction is brilliant, fight scenes are first-rate and writing is great, worthy screenplay. The acting is good for the most part, I thought Farell although a little miscast (i call it misplaced) in this role was not bad. Jared Leto gave the best performance of the film while Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins were also solid. Leto's portrayal of Alexander's good friend and apparent lover, Hephaistion, was great. I thought Rosario Dawson was decent as Alexander's bartrian wife. The cast is not bad, although a few mistakes were made obviously, especially farell and jolie. Jolie's performance was definitely the weakest, her portrayal of Alexander's mom just did not appeal to me. By the way this film portrays persians in a pretty bad manner, but hey i guess i can live with that because its being told from the Greek point of view, and fac remains they did kick our army's butt, lol. Anyways, a decent film, not the best, but not the worse, a bit too long, but i enjoyed, had some great moments. 8/10"
"gradyharp","8","1","8","3 August 2005"," A Director's Cut Reformation of Alexander
","Few films have garnered the criticism as the theatrical release of the much maligned Alexander and that fact always stirs the curiosity cauldron - in this case, so much so that Oliver Stone decided to re-edit and re-compose the original version into this Director's Cut DVD. Now the film can be viewed in the relatively inexpensive milieu of the home and perhaps more folks will give another (or, as in my case, a first) look at what the grumbling is all about.<br/><br/>Alexander is a big film about a big person who did big things. How a story so altered by time, history, myth, and folklore could be translated to the screen strains the imagination - but not Oliver Stone's - a man who loves big events and big issues. And I think he succeeds in drawing us into the atmosphere of the 'civilized world' of Alexander's time. Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) relates the history of a man who wished to tie the known world together into one empire and would have us believe that dream was altruistic as well as destined. Through a series of flash forwards and flashbacks the birth to death of Alexander is pieced together: each time a great moment or crisis occurs in Alexander's life, the story backtracks to explain the etiological influences of that particular step in Alexander's march around the globe.<br/><br/>The settings of Alexander's youth in Macedonia are breathtakingly beautiful in the cave painting details of the various gods and heroes and heroines that so deeply influenced the life of Alexander - Medea, Oedipus, Herakles, Zeus, etc. If the entire film had been able to maintain this mystic quality of ambiance, this would have been a powerful work. But once the scenes begin to disperse to Persia, India, Greece, etc the film becomes Hollywoodized and hearkens back to the Cecil B. DeMille view of ancient history, garnished with expensive sets and costumes and endless dancing maidens and overwrought battle sequences.<br/><br/>Where this film (at least this version) is best is when it approaches the passion of Alexander for Hephaistion. Few writers or film makers have dared to enter the arena of homosexual love of heroes of history and this is where Stone takes the chance - and then unfortunately heavily edits the romance from this 'director's cut'. A missed opportunity to examine an important aspect of neglected history is sad.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Colin Farrell does his best with the script he has in making us believe in Alexander, and he is able to connect the chemistry with Jared Leto's Hephaistion well. Angelina Jolie is aptly smarmy as the snake-loving Olympias, Val Kilmer's Philip, grotesquely hidden behind scars of makeup, is suitably evil, but given the tritely written roles of Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) and Roxane (Rosario Dawson) the rest of the cast is forgettable.<br/><br/>But now that the film is available in two forms for less money than a pair of theater tickets perhaps more people will watch, plug in to Oliver Stone's concept, and the air will clear. I, for one, think it is a film worth watching! Grady Harp"
"EijnarAmadeus","7","1","8","5 May 2005"," Alexander conquers both Troy and Arthur
","THE LAST SAMURAI was the first of the sword-and-saddle genre and was a indisputable instant classic. Followed by three huge challengers featuring Troy, King Arthur and Alexander (and now Kingdom Of Heaven) -Alexander leaps from director Oliver Stone's brilliant directing and takes Colin Farrell to a new stage of acting.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is very convincing and good in his lead character, and together with Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer the cast works very well. And heading as a deadly arrow Alexander strikes very vital at first sight, and the fine surprise of it is that it keeps itself like that. Very deadly in it's straight ahead drama the movie is far more convincing, dramatic, catching and deadly than both TROY and KING ARTHUR. The action scenes of Troy were fantastic and the photo of Arthur was beautiful, but Alexander pitches all the small buttons very nice in it's ambitious way. Not reaching for unknown heights with millions of people fighting each other over and over, and not seeming to big for itself's good. It captures a bizarre mood in a Oliver Stone way and makes friends with the audience being bona fide Stone with delicious directing, music and cinematography. Colin Farrell being a blond haired legend that has feelings for both men and women, gets caught between the pure Oliver Stone obsessions and the haunting for greatness, but it works fine! Angelina Jolie may not do her best performance (has she ever done one?) but she makes the movie be more interesting under the huge gaps when Alexander's character can't fill the emptiness, and so with Alexander's father played by a aging Kilmer.<br/><br/>Where TROY had too many battles Alexander takes things easy and gets more character development in between, and where KING ARTHUR were uninteresting and too cheesy, Alexander is realistic and bizarre. Though it hasn't got anything against Cruise's Asian trip, Alexander is a very much good film and Stone has succeeded by all means. Though it may not have the pure beautiness or great aspects, all the small parts are here - as a eagle flies we get a close-up before it surfs threw the air and we get the true perspective of the battle that's about to rage. And the brilliant scene seeing Alexander facing an elephant, it's bona fide Oliver Stone."

This was sadly too easy for small minds to pick fault towards.

The producers deserve it for their boldness. Oliver Stone did a great job. The battle scenes are extraordinary and the last one really moved me. The mad ride of Alexander towards the elephants and his eventual fall is easily one of the great moments of the movies this year. There is so much meaning to that single moment(clash of cultures, the defeat of his dream, the price he pays for it, etc),it is an awesome image.I could go on and on, but I will just say: see it, reflect and be astonished."
"Laakbaar","9","1","8","1 January 2005"," A great flick
","Go see this movie. It's interesting and intelligent. It's a great movie experience. I read a good many of the reviews here before seeing the film so I had a few trepidations going in. But after actually seeing it for myself, I really don't understand all the negativity.<br/><br/>I felt the movie was the right length and I had no problem following it. The acting was excellent. I don't understand the criticism of Angelina Jolie. She was given the role of the intense, scary, slightly crazy ""barbarian"" mother and I thought she played it perfectly. The accents were not an issue for me at all. The special effects and battle scenes were impressive, believable, suitably gory and exciting.<br/><br/>I was intrigued by Stone's exploration of Alexander's psychology and especially his relationships with Olympias, Hephaistion and Roxane. I appreciate this kind of psychological insight into a dry figure from history. Stone's references to Greek myth and his choice of Ptolemy as narrator were also interesting and appropriate.<br/><br/>A final point about the homosexuality. It seemed to me that in this movie the homosexuality was treated quite appropriately. It's indeed jarring to many of us 23 centuries later (especially in conservative America) to see how homosexuality could have been so routine, especially in a warrior society. Stone's treatment of it never felt uncomfortable or ridiculous. What would have been ridiculous, of course, is for Oliver Stone to make a movie about Alexander and not deal up front with this aspect of Alexander's life and times. Kudos to Stone for having the guts and intelligence not to shy away from this topic, although I suppose it cost him millions.<br/><br/>Anyway, like I said, don't let this one pass you by."
"seshat6","10","1","8","20 December 2004"," The Best epic movie for critical thinking audiences
","People who claim this movie is a disappointment are probably expecting a superficial cartoon-like epic such as Troy or Gladiator. This movie on the other hand does not have a simple story. It presents a new take on plausible events in the life of Alexander the great, conveying his dreams and ideas. The style of Oliver Stone is recognizable in the visions and flashbacks, something that might put down Troy fans, but that certainly adds character to the movie. <br/><br/>The visuals of the movie are absolutely amazing. The Battle scenes with Darius are very well done and the battle in India conveys so much power.<br/><br/>I would have liked to get a little bit more insight into the Persian Empire. To know better the allies Alexander made among them. But to go into this other dimension in an already 3-hour long film would be asking for too much. Hopefully the DVD version will include these extra scenes :)<br/><br/>In summary I found this movie the best I have seen among the movies based on Ancient Greece or Rome. A definitively must see for Oliver Stone fans and for history enthusiasts.<br/><br/>P.S. Reviewers should get over the ""Alexander being gay is an insult"". Besides, the movie has so many other dimensions that people only focusing on that depiction for giving a low score to the movie are already so narrow-minded that their score shouldn't be taken seriously."
"caspian1978","4","1","8","17 December 2004"," Where's the story
","For starters, Oliver Stone is a great director whether or not he makes a good or bad movie. In my opinion, Alexander is not one of the top movies that he will be remembered for. Much like Any Given Sunday, Alexander is a big movie with a big cast and budget. While Any Given Sunday has a great story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, Alexander has a story without a story. The movie spent so much time worrying about telling the story of Alexander that they forgot to tell the story. I will admit, I had to walk out of the cinema after the first 2 hours of the movie. Finding out that there was another hour to go, I lost all hope. By the two hour mark, they were still trying to answer the WHY and the HOW in Alexander's life. Since the Passion of the Christ, I think Hollywood is without a reason why they can not produce a quality product on a historical event at a fraction of the cost. Alexander's budget was 3 times of the Passion, and an hour longer. The end result was a giant blockbuster for one, and a good attempt by another."
"optik","8","1","8","13 December 2004"," Worth seeing for the epic scenes
","Alexander has a series of epic sequences that are worth seeing and the movie also has a tremendous soundtrack by Vangelis. At times it feels like a 150 million dollar History Channel show. If you enjoy watching the History Channel this is the ultimate historical show. The most impressive moments of the movie are the massive battle against Persia, the entrance to Babylon featuring the Hanging Gardens, the crossing of Asia through the mountains and valleys and the battles in Indian jungles. These scenes are Hollywood grandeur at its best and the all star cast puts on a good show. <br/><br/>It is odd that critics have been so harsh on this film, if you see it I think you'll find it a worthwhile experience."
"brichelle7","10","1","8","9 December 2004"," Loved It
","It is truly amazing how Alexander can garner such vile reviews from one group of people while there's another camp which finds the movie riveting. I, for one, enjoyed the movie. I didn't find it lengthy or boring. It's not the best that I have seen so far, but it was worth the price of the movie ticket. As much as I like Angelina Jolie, I couldn't help wondering how Sharon Stone would have handled the devilish role. As for the part of Alexander, I can't imagine anyone else besides Colin Farrell as the young charismatic conqueror. Oliver Stone has made a wise choice. Perhaps other actors like the magnificent Tom Cruise or dashing Leonardo Di Carprio could have made better Alexanders, but I still prefer Colin. I wouldn't watch the film three times at the cinemas if not for the mega talented and interesting Irishman. At first I thought he cried too much, I mean being a warrior and all, he shouldn't shed tears so easily. But after watching the movie a second time, I understand his turmoil. He can cry as much as he wants to, he'll always be my favourite Alexander."
"xbrad68","10","1","8","5 December 2004"," Alexander THE GREAT AND PHILIP OF MACEDON MIRROR THE CIA/OSS
","The life of Philip of Macvdon as played by Val Kilmer closely mirrors the life of Wild Bill Donovan the leader of the Office of Strategic Service during the second world war. Like Philip, Donovan took a nation state and set it on the path to being a world power. The man who seemed like a child of Donovan was President REAGANs cabinet member Bill Casey Director of the Central Intelligence Agency during 1981 to 1987. Casey helped impose Pax Americana on the world and pressed the Evil old Soviet Empire to the firewall as one of my Brock University Profs Craig Hanyan said. Casey launched the ambitious Opeation Ivy Bells that monitored undersea Russian communications cables. The Iran Contra affair was Caseys version of Alexanders Indian campaign because there were setbacks and it was agreed by historians that both men reached too far. Casey passed away before being called to testify in the Iran-Contra affair before president REAGANS second term was over making the student of history muse that both Casey and Alexander were called away before their time. Then who would represent Ptolemy at the CIA you might ask why none other than former CIA agent PORTER GOSS and current Director of Central Intelligence. GOSS is already a hero for his former work with the CIA and willing himself to walk again after a lengthy illness, he is also a statesman from his time as a Republican Congessman from Florida. It is during the watch of DCI GOSS that more of the history of DCI Casey will be written. So like Ptolemy played by Anthony Hopkins DCI GOSS too will chronicle the life of one of his Predeceasers DCI Casey. Not to be left out of this Brotherhood of SPOOKS the Godlike President GEORGE W BUSH is like the mighty God Zeus because Air Force One sounds like thunder. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie does a creditable job of acting. I liked Val Kilmer as Philip of Macedon immensely. I gave Alexander a ten out of ten. To paraphrase President Reagan there will always be a bright dawn for America and the CIA."

As for our neighbors who think that they can stole some of our history, I say to them that they can have some, because those days they were slaves to us.

"DavidB-7","8","1","9","28 October 2005"," surprisingly interesting
","Like others, I had heard poor opinions of this movie. Watching it tonight, for the first time, I found many things of interest. Here are a few, in no particular order.<br/><br/>1) It is clearly an anti-war movie: most of the characters have no option but to fight; none seems to enjoy doing so.<br/><br/>2) It seems to me well tuned into pre-Aristotelian tradition. In the age of Aeschylus, it became possible to imitate dark things and -- through fear and pity -- partially to tame them. Stone seemed to understand this, particularly when Phillip shows Alexander the wall paintings.<br/><br/>3) At first I found it strange that Alexander remained so trapped in his teenage. At the age of 33 (the age of Jesus of Nazareth, reputedly, taking on Pilate and the Sanhedrin) he seemed to have grown little from the bright-eyed pupil at the Academy. Stone clearly intended this metastasis: the backtracking by 10 and then by 9 years was signposted in school-masterly fashion.<br/><br/>4) Hopkins' Ptolemy is intended to be a boring old f*rt. He gives us as much as a rational man can of A's genesis and nemesis. Stone wants us to explore what remains.<br/><br/>5) The charges made by some of homo-eroticism are ludicrous. There is only one sex scene, between A and Roxanne, which was presumably intended to deepen the platonic relationship between A and Hephaistion. (I imagine that Stone was being deliberately unhistorical in portraying A and H as chaste; such is the burden of writing for US audiences.)<br/><br/>6) Yet, ultimately, for me, the movie failed to convince. I wanted to see Alexander transformed by his ontogeny. Instead, he seemed to be trapped by it. But that was a failing of some import; perhaps Stone intended it.<br/><br/>7) This movie will get better and better ratings as more folk watch it, out of the hothouse of commercial ratings. Already I feel that I need to watch it a second time.<br/><br/>David Broadhurst"

It was a bit like history-class...<br/><br/>What i really don't understand is the big fuss about the love affairs in the movie. These were mentioned everywhere, i really did'n't see it. Of course there was some kissing, but if Gladiator was a bit history-real, then Russell probably had two boys in his tent every night. So i found this movie to be very neat and credible.

Collin Farrell provides an excellent performance as Alexander, Jared Leto is terrific as Hephaistion, Val Kilmer (Phillip), Christopher Plummer (Aristotle), Connor Paolo (Young Alexander), Rosario Dawson (Roxane), and Anthony Hopkins (Old Ptolemy) provide excellent support in their roles. Angelina Jolie is absolutely mesmerizing as Olympias; she makes this film unique with her wonderful accent and performance. It is unthinkable that this film was ignored by the Academy Awards for the performances of Collin, Angelina, and Val...all deserved nominations...Angelina certainly should have won a supporting Oscar in this role!

","A lot of the comments I heard coming out of the US were complaints that the title character was Gay, and that Colin Farrell had died his hair Blonde.<br/><br/>Well, firstly, Alexander was noted for his blonde hair and his piercing blue eyes. Secondly he, and a sizable chunk of his professional army, was indeed bisexual. One elite unit being known as 'the Companions' was no accident.<br/><br/>Bisexuality was encouraged amongst the ranks. Such an outlook could be viewed as practical in such a campaign as it lessened the rape of indigenous and conquered peoples and made their subjugation and acceptance of Greek rule easier. It also lessened the length of the baggage train, as fewer camp followers would be present.<br/><br/>Onto the film itself, yes it's long, but when you enter a film directed by Oliver Stone, that's one of the things you expect (do 'JFK' and Any Given Sunday ring bells with people).<br/><br/>I was a little disturbed at first to find the Macedonians sounding like an Irish Boy Band, but as the film rode on, it became more acceptable as it made Colin Farrell's job easier when it came to his driving speeches, added a unifying factor to this small central group of characters and made it abundantly clear (in a nice 'Show don't tell' way) the Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson were not of the same nation as the rest of the main cast.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are few and far between for a film about the life of the man who conquered not only much of the known world, but also a large chunk of world that had only been viewed before as legendary. The director concentrating more on the personal events of Alexander's life the military achievements which made him famous, tearing down some of the myths and putting in a little of a more believable man, stressed by the power and responsibility in his hands and burdened by the respective desires of his parents and their use of him as a pawn in his early life.<br/><br/>I had hoped for greater coverage of the battles in his campaigning life, but was not disappointed by the quality of those that were there, although they may have disappointed some who have marvelled at the Last Alliance, Helms Deep and Pelenor Fields in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but Alexander is a tale of a real hero and not a fantastical vision of magic and beasts All in all a well conceived, acted and directed picture that has been subjected to unfair comparisons fantastical visions and a misguided comments from an uneducated audience."

","When I heard that the story of Alexander the Great would be made into a motion picture, I was ecstatic! This was about 4 years ago when I heard about it. Originally Baz Luhrman was at the helm. Or was it Martin Scorcese. And Leonardo DiCaprio was on to star. Bottom line. The film was going to be made. I had hoped Hollywood had learned from the days of Fox's Cleopatra (1963). I loved Cleopatra and respected it even more after learning about the monstrous undertaking of the production. Anytime Hollywood makes an epic movie, you know it will be a huge undertaking. I know when I go to see an epic film based on an epic hero like Alexander, I expect beautiful sets and costumes. Alexander delivered! I was impressed with Alexander's entrance to Babylon. The architecture is beautiful. Great Quicktime VR on the movie website. The story was even more familiar to me because I am reading Mary Renault's Nature of Alexander. The music was gorgeous much like all of Vangelis' work. Alexander also sparked a renewed interest in history for me. I hope Hollywood continues to defy odds and create more epics like Alexander! Thank you Oliver Stone!"

","I absolutely LOVED this movie! I don't know what is wrong with critics, but obviously they know nothing about Alexander the Great. I thought it was very well put together.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that they skipped some major battles that Alexander fought with his father Philip, long before the battle of Guagamela. That battle itself was a bit confusing, but that didn't take away from the excitement.<br/><br/>Angelina was incredible!

"smoothhoney1265","8","1","9","19 January 2005"," Not fantastic, but entertaining and quite nice to look at
","Before watching the film I heard some good but mostly bad things about it. But as I like to make my own opinion about things in general and movies in special, I went to see it. Besides  Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Jared Leto  OF COURSE I WANTED TO SEE IT! After the film was over I was dead impressed. By Alexander's achievements. On the one hand he had conquered 90% of the whole territory as it was known at his time (by feet and on horses!) and made himself king over  what was it?  four countries and three continents? On the other hand he had the same problems we have today  jealous lovers, jealous wives, a weak father and an overprotecting mother. Pity he died at 33  he may have achieved even more.<br/><br/>And I must say that I was really entertained by the film. Because from the cineastic point of view it's a great motion picture  talented, mostly young and good looking actors, beautiful costumes, gorgeous sets (e.g. the ""hanging"" Gardens of Babylon, one of the seven world wonders), hot battles and a fantastic music score (by Vangelis). Also, Alexander's life was told very interesting and although Stone jumped back and forth in time now and then you always knew what was going on and what happened after what. Respect for that! Yet there are two things I want to criticize about this movie: 1. The battles. OK, Stone had to be politically and historically and whatever correct and basically those battles had everything a battle needs  fights, horses (and even elephants!), spears, blood, tears, losses and gains  but come on, DID they have to be that long and detailed and pathetic? In my opinion Stone could have shorten them and concentrate on other aspects of the story. And this brings us to 2. The way Stone portrayed Alexander's relationships. I know, many people have already criticized that but I wanted to say my opinion. First: His wife Roxanne. OK, Alex was married to her but she was neither his only wife nor the most important one. He merely married her to demonstrate his alliance with Asia, where she came from. So it was simply unnecessary to concentrate on this relationship too much and even more unnecessary was the love scene between her and Alexander (although the scene was nicely portrayed). Second: It's a fact that Alexander had mostly male lovers and the movie at least mentions the two important of them: His best friend and companion Hephaistion and the dancer Bagoas. But what I don't get is: When it comes to Bagoas and Hephaistion Alexander gives them obvious looks of lust etc. yet all you see is a kiss between Bagoas and Alexander and between Hephaistion and Alexander there's nothing going on but hugging. Come on  that's the relationship niveau of two thirteen-year-old buddies exploring their sexuality, but not a relationship between two adult lovers. I know, the reason was once again the homophobic American audience, but it's just an insult towards Alexanders' feelings and the viewers' expectations. Speak of historical correctness! <br/><br/>Nothing to complain about the main actors though. Farrell gives a nice and sensitive performance though his best performance was in ""Phone Booth"" and his most sensitive in ""A Home at the end of the World"". But he is nice to look at and tries his best. Besides, I've read a book about Alexander the Great and somewhere in this book found an image of the king which totally resembles to Farrell so I guess he was a good choice. Val Kilmer is good as usual  he's like Tom Hanks  a good actor who does fine work in every role. Angelina Jolie was the one who impressed me most. Up to ""Alexander"" I thought she's no more but a pretty Hollywood slut but she really is a great actress and truly royal. She's all grace and beauty and dignity here. Special credit goes to two other, up to now unknown actors who will probably become famous after ""Alexander"": Connor Paolo and Francisco Bosch. Connor plays Young Alexander and is truly a great actor for his age. Besides his resemblance to the looks and his imitation of the moves of Farrell is just stunning. Or was Farrell imitating him? Francisco Bosch, a Spanish ballet dancer who currently works in the UK was graceful and beautiful as Bagoas, Alexander's lover. He didn't speak at all but his eyes told a story of their own. Amazing! So after all one can say that ""Alexander"" isn't as bad as it's told. It just depends on the reasons you want to see the movie and the expectations you have for it. Just go in, lean back and let them entertain you  you will enjoy most of it."
"schnuerbel","10","1","9","21 December 2004"," Completely misunderstood by the audience
","The fact that the moral values in ancient Greece were different than in the modern U.S. will make this movie fail. The expectation of the average moviegoer is to see something like Gladiators. Instead, they are being confronted with facts.<br/><br/>If you are disturbed by historical facts such as Alexander being gay, then please don't watch this movie. There might eventually one day be a politically cleaned ""TV-version"" on DVD that you might then want to watch.<br/><br/>The greatest military commander in history whines, pouts, is hated by his troops, is arrogant, rapes his bride on the wedding night, is overtly gay, is dominated by his mother, is publicly insecure, constantly crying and pouting.<br/><br/>This is finally a movie that puts Alexanders personality in the center stage. Apparently it is disturbing to a lot of people (reviewers here) that a personality is not one-dimensional. Either someone is good - or someone is bad. Again, if you are looking for such fictional characters, don't watch Alexander.<br/><br/>And last but not least: Don't watch it, if you are looking for some historical absolution that would glorify todays wars and their commanders.<br/><br/>This movie is for the rest of us."
"chiehlilee","8","1","9","18 November 2004"," BISEXUALITY IS NOT A POLITICAL AGENDA! IT ACTUALLY EXISTS!
","For those who accuses the film with political agenda, please read up on your history before blabbering off showing how ignorant you are. Bisexuality has existed throughout history and before conservative Christian zealots took over the Western civilization, it was considered a natural thing.<br/><br/>Although the movie was a bit too long and drags a bit at times and some of the scenes were quite sappy, I did find the movie enjoyable. Oliver Stone did try his best to recreate a society that is truthful (rather than white washed by Christian conservatisms).<br/><br/>As many studies in psychologies have shown, people who have trouble with certain issues especially regarding sexuality is because it is too painfully a reflection on themself. If you have trouble with the bisexual scenes in this movie, maybe its time for you to examine your own sexuality more closely."
"Rioton","10","1","9","17 November 2004"," Genius.
","Last night I saw Alexander. <br/><br/>I don't know where to start. I guess the two main questions are ""Is it any good/Did you like it?"" and ""How was The Gay?"" Actually, that's three questions - I often like movies even though I don't think they're good. But I'll roll the first two into one answer, anyhow.<br/><br/>And the answer, in this case, is the same to both: an enthusiastic and unqualified yes.<br/><br/>Whatever else you might say of Oliver Stone, he is a passionate filmmaker, and passion is exactly what is required to tell the story of Alexander the Great. I am very curious to see what the Alexander afficianados will have to say about it, since by necessity much was amalgamated and even more was left out. I'm equally curious about what those who know nothing of him will make of it. For myself, I found the story Oliver Stone and his co-writers came up with to be cohesive, coherent, and compelling. It privileged the man over the achievements, and while there were some awesome (in the sense of inspiring awe, at least in me) battle scenes, the war campaign was not the heart of the film: the heart of the man was the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the question of The Gay. <br/><br/>While it's true that there is no on-screen sex between men in the film (there is one fade-to-black when Alexander beckons Bagoas to his bed), the film does not shy away from the love between Alexander and Hephaestion. Quite the opposite, in fact. I think Val Kilmer, in this month's Vanity Fair, makes reference to ""the scene where Alexander and Hephaestion pledge their love to each other"" as being one of the most moving he's seen. My question to him is, ""Which one, Val?"" For there are no less than three scenes that I would say fit that description. *emogasm* Honestly, the emotions are so intense and are portrayed so wonderfully and wondrously by the two actors, that I don't miss the sex. I wish I had taken notes in the Q&A, because that question came up and Colin went into an impassioned explanation of what they chose to show and why. He talked about how bisexuality as we know it today did not exist in Alexander's day, so when they were making the film they didn't think about whether or not he was gay. They just looked at his relationship with Hephaestion and wanted to show the love. The purity of it; Colin came back to that a couple of times. And he made it very clear that he didn't mean they weren't physically involved, it was that sexual relations were not the defining characteristic of the love: ""Whether or not they ever had sex,"" he said, ""their love was as pure as the driven snow."" He went on to say that their sexual relationship, if they had one, most likely came about naturally as they grew up and explored together; and by the time we see adult Alexander and Hephaestion in the film, that aspect of their relationship had passed. I'm doing my best to preserve the language and manner in which Colin spoke. He seemed to equivocate in the beginning of sentences sometimes, never outright stating that Alexander and Hephaestion had been lovers; but in the middles and ends of sentences, his belief (or what I'm interpreting as his belief) came through. Someone asked about Alexander's death, since it was unclear to her from the ending of the film what he actually died of. Colin said they left it open because there's no definitive proof: some speculate he was poisoned, others that he died of a broken heart (""and I may be one of them, at times,"" Colin said), still others that it was the cumulation of years of injuries (""and a broken heart,"" Colin added), or maybe it was typhoid. He also said somewhere in there that he himself is a romantic. <br/><br/>It would be very difficult for me to love Colin any more than I do right now.<br/><br/>Another thing he talked about, and I'm veering back to more general discussion of the film, is how Oliver Stone is a deeply patriotic filmmaker. He likened Stone's films to an intervention: it's not that Oliver Stone hates America, rather that he loves it so much he wants it stop destroying itself, and he's trying to show it how it's going wrong. There is a scene in Alexander that marries politics of sexuality to military politics, in an insistent and subversive way that makes me want to label the film genius. Unfortunately, I think it's genius that's destined for box office failure; America's not in the mood for this type of mirror right now.<br/><br/>There's so much more, but I think I should wait for the film to come out so I can have actual discussions with people, instead of babbling at you!"
"negropaiper","9","1","10","23 March 2006"," Excellent
","I think Stone is one of the most remarkable directors, platoon, JFK, Nixon, Alexander, etc. people that saw Alexander in theaters did not get to see the version Stone wanted, that is the studio version. I've seen Alexander director's cut about 4 times, much better than the one they showed in cinemas. What a masterpiece, excellent, perfect, beautiful... war scenes are how they really where in those times, and also remember Stone fought in Vietnam. I think the general public didn't like it so much was because it is a very disturbing story, about sex, drugs, alcohol, homosexuality, war, pain, faith, love, hate and religion...people don't seem to get that homosexuality in those times was a very normal thing. so for the general public to see Alexander kissing his friends, and later kissing his wife, gets weird. Braveheart is a good movie, but has so many historical mistakes, in order to make it fit for screen and because they want the movie to sell, the same with the horrible Troy, and Gladiator, but Alexander takes movie making to another level, you can see how millions of Greeks and Asians fight to death in one of the most bloody centuries of mankind. the movie has two wars, both perfectly shot, this is the kind of war you have never seen on film, braveheart's horses are replaces by camels and elephants, in a never seen before battle field, taking us into the dusty dessert, and into the jungle. perfect acting by Anthony Hopkins, an excellent Collin Farrel, and as always, a lovely and sexy Angelina Jolie, val kilmer is great as king Phillip, Alexander's father...you should see this movie, but try to get the directors cut, far better than the original studio editing piece of crap....great score by Greek composer Vangelis, who got a nice budget for experimenting with percussion instruments, this makes the score so much powerful....you should watch this movie...great great film."
"spj-4","10","1","10","11 December 2005"," Alexander THE GREAT as portrayed
","This was an extremely appealing movie to me from beginning to end! I thought it was set up for the ensuing war sequences with precision, and did not shy away from the abhorrence of war. I was reminded on several occasions of the barbarity of war through the ages, where human beings are today being too often reduced to some nett gain on a balance sheet of detachment that would only appeal to powermongers and their spin doctors.<br/><br/>But Alexander is much more than a war movie! It is FULL of inspiration and concern for the humanity of portrayed victims. as too of the treachery and appalling gross injustice of those who may outlive them! By my knowledge of history, this movie has been well researched, but more importantly, is presented with compassion & an imaginative vision that has prevailed across time & place into the essence of what is good or idealistic. As such, it is untainted by the darker aspects of its presentation, merely giving the viewer a glimpse of what is desirable and what is not! On the first hour of Alexander, I would have rated it a 10+, but I thought it slightly got lost in the middle with numerous time period shifts forward and backward, before it settled down to a deserved rating of 10. <br/><br/>Highly recommended!"
"eternal_dreamweaver","10","1","10","14 September 2005"," This is a great movie!
","I finally got a chance to see Alexander this month (I missed it at the theatres last year so I waited for the DVD release). I truly cannot understand why so many find this movie to be bad. I liked Troy but Alexander runs circles around that movie. The storyline is very well written, and without giving anything away I'll say that this movie is entertaining and well worth the near three hours in length. Colin Farrell, who I thought at first would not be able to pull this off, was incredible in the role of Alexander, as well as Angelina Jolie who isn't one of my favorite actresses but played her part well. Plus from the female standpoint there are a lot of very cute guys in this movie - Colin Farrell, Jared Leto, Gary Stretch, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyer to name a few. I love this film so much that I watched it at least seven times the first weekend I had the DVD rental, and as soon as I could I went out and bought a copy of my own! People who bash this movie have no idea what a good drama is all about. If you haven't seen it check it out, you will enjoy it. :D"
"seshat6","10","1","10","5 February 2005"," A new take on the classical world
","People who claim this movie is a disappointment are probably expecting a superficial cartoon-like epic such as Troy or Gladiator. This movie on the other hand does not have a simple story. It presents a new take on events in the life of Alexander the great, conveying his dreams and ideas. The style of Oliver Stone is recognizable in the visions and flashbacks, something that might put down Troy fans, but that certainly adds character to the movie.<br/><br/>The visuals of the movie are absolutely amazing. The Battle scenes with Darius are very well done and the battle in India conveys so much power.<br/><br/>I would have liked to get a little bit more insight into the Persian empire. To know better the allies Alexander made among them. But to go into this other dimension in an already 3-hour long film would be asking for too much.<br/><br/>In summary I found this movie the best I have seen among the movies based on Ancient Greece or Rome. A must see for Oliver Stone fans and for history enthusiasts."
"nutterjames","8","1","10","22 January 2005"," A classic epic
","I saw the film two weeks after it's release at the cinema and had read all it's reviews so I purposefully went in with a clear mind. What better way to start off a film with a Vangelis soundtrack, from that I knew this would be a great film! I enjoyed the film tremendously. It had it's faults but kept me glued to the screen for the whole film. I have a soft spot for epics and I enjoy Oliver Stones detailed style so I relished seeing this piece of cinematography.<br/><br/>I thought Colin Farrel played his role very well although his blond hair and eyebrows did look fake. It is noticeable that he studied his character in great detail and that he really enjoyed playing Alexander. His army looked so dedicated to him that it seems they would follow him in any real-life battle.<br/><br/>I did not enjoy the part of the film seeing Alexander as a child, it made me want to see the grown up Alexander in a hurry. Once Colin Farrel appeared the film gained its lustre. I thought all Alexander's generals played their roles excellently. I did not find the homosexuality in the film overbearing and I think if anyone does they might be predujiced."
"charlescurtis2003","10","1","10","19 January 2005"," Much greater than what people say.
","First of all, I've given up on trying to figure out why critics savaged this film so badly. The main reasons I remember reading was that it was (1) Too long (2) Too much focus on Alexander's bisexuality (3) Time shifts back and forth. While the film could have been a little shorter, there is nothing wrong with it as it is. Oliver Stone went for a very broad epic story while at the same time keeping it character driven. Very few films have ever been able to do this, chiefly Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell's Alexander is not larger than life, even though Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) refers to him as a colossus. He is a conflicted man, warped emotionally by those close to him, mainly his mother. His affinity for his father in spite of his excesses and his desire to be accepted by him reflect the attitude of many young men today.<br/><br/>As for the relationship with Hephaestion, I felt that it was very tastefully done, as was the one with Bagoas. Stone proves that some things can still be suggested or implied as opposed to expressed and work.<br/><br/>Of course my favorite scenes were the battles of Gaugamela and Hydaspes (India), and if I were to have a complaint about the film, it would have been to include Grannicus as well (the 1956 version with Richard Burton did). Excellent display of phalanx warfare. I thought it was interesting near the end when he talks of making war with the ""Roman Tribe.""<br/><br/>Had he lived to, would we remember Rome as anything more than a footnote in history now?<br/><br/>Again, great film, certainly Oscar-worthy (but won't get it). It will be remembered."

If you compare this movie to an ideal perfect movie then of course it is not very good. However, if you compare this movie to a film like ""Troy"", or other historical epics it compares quite well.<br/><br/>The use of Greek mythology was also good. He showed that Alexander had complex psychological issues dealing with his mother and father. It also painted a very vivid portrait of the way dynastic struggles worked. <br/><br/>I was emotionally moved by the dialouge, and the acting was strong.<br/><br/>It compares well with Oliver Stones other films."
"fckingrighties","10","1","11","30 September 2005"," A Review Of Both The Theatrical and Director's Cut of the Film
","THEATRICAL VERSION Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" is a great film that chronicles the life of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian King/General that conquered 90% of the ""Known World,"" and was never defeated in battle! From great performances by Colin Farrell (who performance in this film is highly underrated) and an all-star cast, to it's brilliant recreations of Ancient places, as well as some exciting battle sequences, the film never ceases to be both exciting and emotional! It is a thrilling and historically accurate portrayal of the man whose dreams and vision would shape the world in which we live in today!<br/><br/>THE DIRECTOR'S CUT Oliver Stone's new Director's Cut of ""Alexander"" is slightly better than the theatrical version. Scenes were cut (Including some of Anthony Hopkins' beautiful portrayal of Old Ptolemy), but the new material is just as good. Some scenes were reshaped, and are much better because of it. If you didn't enjoy the theatrical version, then you may enjoy Stone's new Director's Cut.<br/><br/>THE DVD: Both of the DVD releases of the film feature the same three-part behind-the-scenes documentary by Sean Stone (Which could have been better, but is still fascinating), as well as an interesting featurette on Greek composer Vangelis scoring the film. The commentary tracks on both DVD's are worthwhile. The one on the theatrical DVD is by Stone and Historical Consultant Robin Lane Fox, who gives great historical insights and further details on the real Alexander. Most of Stone's comments are the same as on the Director's Cut DVD, in which he is the only participant. Although I don't agree with Stone politically, he has a fine grasp of the English language, and has a powerful presence when he speaks. His insight into Alexander, as well as the making of this ""unconventional historical epic,"" are fascinating to listen to on both versions of the film.<br/><br/>IN CLOSING: All in all, both DVD's are worthwhile. No matter which version of the film you end up seeing, know that Oliver Stone has truly captured the essence and the grandeur of one of histories greatest legends. This film should definitely hold a place in everyone's collection of historical epics.<br/><br/>Theatrical Cut Grade: A Director's Cut Grade: A DVD Grade: A"

","Before i watched Alexander yesterday i looked on IMDb.com to see how it was rated. after seeing that it had an average of 5,5 i was rather disappointed. This all changed when i saw the movie yesterday.<br/><br/>I've read in a comment somewhere that the first 45 minutes were boring and that the movie only got exciting after the first battle-scene. I don't agree with this. The movie had me when the title first appeared on the screen and the time that it took to get to the first battle-scene didn't look so long to me because in my opinion the movie was very interesting. I thought the introduction by the old ptolemy was well build up and throughout the movie it somehow reminded me of Salieri telling his story about Mozart in Amadeus.<br/><br/>As for Colin Farrel, in whom i didn't have much fate before watching this movie, he really surprised me as Alexander. He displayed a very believable character who was an extraordinary general, a great king and at the other side a sensitive lover of both sexes and a man who was still a boy when he thinks of his father and mother.<br/><br/>In my opinion Oliver Stone and Colin Farrel did a great job to bring this movie to a deeper emotional level by, for example, not covering up the fact that Alexander also had male lovers and was in love with Hephaistion. Unlike in Troy where Brad Pitt portrayed Achilles as an American rather than a Greek. In my view this movie was more European than American and with art that can only be a good thing.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear what others think of my view on this movie and maybe explain why people gave this movie a 5,5 and not more.<br/><br/>Greets from the Netherlands"

I recently went to the movie in Brazil and found two sessions of the movie completely full, getting one of the last seats of the second one. And here is what I saw: A very well made epic, showing with great detail the culture and mind of the Greek-macedonian civilization, with very decent performances (specially Angelina) and full of ever lasting quotes, battle scenes, and war cries. I even doubted Stone's capacity of doing great battle scenes but I was mistaken. They're one of the most realistic war scenes I've seen... it's like the Saving Private Ryan of the ancient world: plenty of blood, battle strategy, armies full of fear, warriors that question their commands... real life.<br/><br/>Besides the war the film portraits in the best way I've seen their culture and philosophy.

If it weren't for the media's bias against Oliver Stone, I'd say this is a shoe in for a bunch of Oscars. The biggest knock I've heard about this movie is that it has way too many ""gay undertones"". Folks learn something about history before you go making judgments like that. That was the way things were for centuries back then. In those times, just about all men had male lovers. That wasn't considered ""gay"". As for the movie itself the acting is good, cinematography is great, the sets and costumes are the most accurate to the times I've seen to date, and the story is very well told. It really delves into Alexander's mind. It deals with his jealousy/hatred towards his father (King Philip) and his love of his mother (Olympias), who protected and manipulated him through out his life.

"Quinoa1984","7","1","12","26 November 2004"," has it's moments of greatness, though surely not overall
","The final product of Oliver Stone's decades-in-the-making epic on Alexander the great had me stunned walking out of the theater. Not because I thought it was particular great or masterful, and not because I thought it was a failure either. What stunned me was how there could be a few points in the film where I thought that Stone, like Alexander in a sense, reached heights he's barely gone to before, but then in other spots he boggled my mind with how he lost me.<br/><br/>For example, take the second battle sequence, in which Alexander leads his weary army towards an Indian army, where Elephants stampede furiously against the troops on horses, and Alexander gets a bit of a shock (one which I won't reveal). After this shock, the rest of the battle scene is tinted, with a red glaze and form that gives the scene a complete, abrasive illusionment. I can consider this to include what is best and worst in Stone's talents as a storyteller - he creates this huge, massive sequence, using multiple angles and special effects. There is also an over-load of the kind of symbolism and melodramatic tendencies that have only popped up occasionally in past Stone films. The main focus being the significance of the bird in the sky (or King Phillip) to be used like the shaman in the Doors, only far too prominent to be easily desired. It's the kind of battle sequence I'd like to analyze shot-by-shot sometime, not necessarily because I'd like it more, but because it's the kind of sequence that you almost never see in major motion pictures.<br/><br/>Like Natural Born Killers (which is one of the ultimate love or hate films ever made), Stone brings his unique, art-house sensibilities to a Hollywood budget and goes wild. The story he tells jumps around in revealing the rise and fall of the Macedonian. More than showing how ferocious and intelligent he was at battle (though that and other scenes of violence take up more than a third of the whole picture), Stone opts to get into his psychology via parents Phillip and Olympia (the sexy, sometimes frightening Angelina Jolie). This is where Stone makes some interesting ground, yet also, more often than not, doesn't know how to stick to something. A lot of the scenes involving Alexander's anger and frustration with his parents probably looked better on paper than they do on screen. And it's not necessarily the actors' faults entirely- the repetitive usage of close-ups, and the sometimes horrendous musical score by Vangelis, adds to it being less engaging. <br/><br/>The acting, much like the direction, tips the scale to both sides by either fitting into their characters wonderfully, or not finding what is there at all and over-playing. Kilmer was impressive at playing a cretin of a father. Jolie was so-so. Leto's was one of the least impressive performances I've seen this year (I just could not see what affect Hephaistilon could have had on Alexander). Dawson and Hopkins were good, though somewhat under-used. Then there is Farrell, who for many who see this film may be what makes or breaks it for them. In most scenes, he finds the right notes and tones for his expression, the way he looks in close-ups. He does prove he can be a leading man in Hollywood. But what disappointed me was in how in some scenes he lost a grip on what he was doing with the character, and I saw less of Alexander and more of Farrell. Sometimes, I suppose, that look in his eyes would just vanish, the kind of look that has been in the major, Dionetic performances of Stones' films (such as Willem Dafore in Platoon, Woody Harrellson in NBK, and Kilmer in The Doors).<br/><br/>Alexander, after a first viewing, is my least favorite of Stone's pictures - much of it goes to lengths with historical exposition that might have fared better to show (three battles, even if it was a small one or in montage, may have balanced out with the other major two) than to go on and on with. It doesn't make the mistakes of this year's Troy, but it doesn't fare much better. Simply put, Alexander the film is like the man himself- an ambitious, crazed man who ended up dividing his audience. Go see it, and know you will be challenged to love, like, or despise it."

Oliver Stone and his entire cast did a bang up job on this movie and I commend them for it. Bravo! Bravo!

"MovieJungle","10","1","20","16 February 2005"," Brilliant Epic.
","Undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year, Oliver Stone's Alexander is a masterpiece of epic proportions. Detailing Alexander's life from an ambitious, yet delicate young man with dreams of glory and achieving mythical status, to the rise of the world's most astounding conqueror. The sounds of the entire film thunder in one's mind for hours after leaving the theater, with the echoing of horses galloping into battle and the clash of steel, Alexander is one not to be missed.<br/><br/>The film has a typical Oliver Stone feel, and this added with the sheer gargantuan scale, leaves one very impressed to say the least. Surely a film to be just as much loathed as much as loved, Alexander has definitely made its mark, no matter what side you've take when leaving the theater.<br/><br/>There are however some major errors that cannot be simply looked over by the public, especially when paying tribute to such a legendary figure. The cast selection is highly questionable, with the likes of the young Alexander sporting a distinctly strong Irish accent and some prominent English accents in other cast members. Oliver Stone once again pushes things too far, and whilst there is nothing wrong with each person's sexual choices in life, the figure of Alexander should have been delved into a more interesting manner.<br/><br/>Alexander gives a battle speech on ""For the Freedom and Glory of Greece"" and not a single Greek looking cast member can be found in the film nor is the language itself used, apart from one sentence from Ptolemy. Other than that not much fault can be found in the performance of either Farrell as Alexander, or Leto as Hephaestion, with Angelina Jolie glowing with beauty as Olympias, mother to Alexander.<br/><br/>It is in fact the addition of Val Kilmer as King Philip of Macedon, who delivers a performance worthy of a king and Hopkins as Ptolemy that really boosts the quality of the film to a different level. In the end, everyone is a critic and there is no wrong from right when it gets to personal opinions regarding film. There are some aspects that cannot be forgotten nor forgiven and yet still the film is extremely enjoyable and short brilliantly. Watch and share your opinions because it's true that they will vary wildly."
"davidmvining","4","0","1","16 June 2020"," The Final Cut
","Yes, Oliver Stone's Final Cut of Alexander improves the film over both the theatrical and director's cuts. No, it's not suddenly some misunderstood masterpiece waiting for rediscovery. It's still a bad film, just not quite as bad as the other two previous cuts.<br/><br/>There are changes throughout the movie, and the most obvious change is Stone's commitment to his idea that Alexander's youth and his conquest of Asia should be told concurrently. This execution is ultimately a very mixed bag with cuts that feel either really thin or completely unrelated alongside some others that highlight some interesting comparisons or contrasts here or there. The film is also more than thirty minutes longer than the previous cuts, but there is no single added sequence that sustains that. It's all a series of small additions here and there, mostly around the Persian boy slave that Alexander takes with him to India. He also rearranged one particular sequence that, in my opinion, made that sequence a whole lot better.<br/><br/>As I said, it's a mixed bag.<br/><br/>Like the Director's Cut, the movie goes from the death of Alexander to Ptolemy narrating, but it then breaks and jumps straight into the Battle of Gaugamela. This is a flabbergasting decision on my part, not because a story of Alexander's conquest of Asia can't begin at Gaugamela (I would have personally started it in Egypt as he's crowned Pharaoh), but because the movie wasn't filmed for it. Our first clear visual look of Alexander in the movie is kind of great, with him on a high rise looking out over the armies as a battle commander, but we then cut to him mid-explanation of the battle plans. It was fine in the Theatrical Cut when the segue worked from his youth to that point, well, it worked well enough, but this is the first time we hear him talk and he's halfway through an emotional explanation of his plans. It's jarring at best.<br/><br/>It jumps back to Alexander's time with Olympias and Philip's drunken attempt to force her into sex that started the main story in the other cuts, but the jump feels weird at best. There is an ultimate point to it, mirroring Alexander's defeat of Darius with his victory in taming Bucephalus, which is kind of interesting, but I don't think it outweighs the awkwardness of the cut. However, how this sequence ends and what it feeds into is the best single cut in the new edition of the film. We watch the scene where Philip explains the myths to Alexander in the caves below Pella, with much talk of glory and myth, and cut right to Alexander marching into Babylon in glorious fashion. That edit might be the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, what follows is the same awkwardly filmed scene of Colin Farrell not quite fitting the role and extreme closeups that minimize the effect of the large sets as we saw in the previous two cuts of the film. See? There's only so much that can be improved by this cut.<br/><br/>The other major additive this cut has is the rearrangement of the wedding between Alexander and Roxana. In the previous two versions, we watch the sequence and it feels random. There's Roxana's dance, an argument between Alexander and his generals, the wedding, and then the wedding night. It makes the decision feel like it's purely driven by sexual urges and there's no real build to the sequence. In this new cut, we see the wedding first, then the argument, then the dance, and then the wedding night. It's a much better sequence of events that gives everything a build towards a climax, so to speak.<br/><br/>The movie underneath the structural changes is the same flawed, way too tightly filmed, and weirdly performed mess of a film. The changes make some interesting choices, but they can't save the film in the least. I've read a lot and watched a lot about the making of this movie, including a long interview with the director of photography, Rodrigo Prieto, and it's obvious that so much effort and love went into the film. Stone had a story he didn't know how to tell, but he was going to make his best effort to tell it.<br/><br/>After three cuts, I think it's safe to say that Oliver Stone's ambition was simply too great for his talents. Yes, fortune favors the bold, but that doesn't mean the bold always succeed.<br/><br/>Alexander is a bad film, and no amount of tinkering around the edges was going to fix that."

","It is very painstaking for this film and it has many interesting scenes from different wars and events, but on the subject and content of the film I realized that the purpose of the film is to portray the Achaemenid Empire and Iran as a defeated country.<br/><br/>He described Alexander as a distorted movie in terms of real history and said: The film begins in Babylon, one of the great cities of Achaemenid Iran. The film is mostly based on a book titled ""The Life of Alexander the Great"" by Blue Tark.

","Much better than I remembered, although the first version of this movie I watched was the Final Cut, so perhaps watching the bulging 3 hour version with no context might have been a mistake.<br/><br/>First the good: I was struck by how much I enjoyed Ptolemy's protracted exposition, wishing for more interludes, Val Kilmer's strong performance and accent, and the soft, human performance of Colin Farrell, enjoying (if it must be a non-Greek cast) the Irish accents throughout. I also liked how the film paces boldly by taking a while to bring adult Alexander in, building his relationships first, no matter how choppy and scene-y they felt.<br/><br/>The bad: It looks horrific, the cinematography by legend Rodrigo Prieto is somehow simultaneously too plain, too saturated, too discordant and visually cacophonous, the sets are flat and cheap, and Oliver Stone's directing showed me how much I missed even the worst works of Ridley Scott in this genre. Jared Leto is conspicuously absent from much of the character development and he looks and sounds like a Pirate extra from Assassin's Creed: Black Flag.<br/><br/>There's some nice oddball editing and some mixed bag music by Vangelis and some competent (although confusing) battles that don't appear too second unit-y by actually feeling quite modern and even heroic, as opposed to horrific, the way Ptolemy might have retold them.
On the retelling of stories, it doesn't care much to delve into Alexander's queerness or the more sordid and arguably more vibrant elements of his conquests and rule.<br/><br/>It's decent, but none of it is clear enough, or has any cohesion; The theatrical cut of Alexander has got shape but the content is cloudy; motivations, history, culture, geography, all a little muddy, secondary to a fusion of some nice lyrical mock-historical dialogue and sort of realistic tone where lots is said, but rarely in very pungent or obvious movie lines, which makes it hard to track what's going on with any efficacy."
"glyn-25860","2","0","2","31 January 2020"," Oliver Stone's Worst Film
","Prior to this movie's release in 2004 there was alot of oscar talk. Oliver Stone had done very long oscar nominated movies before. Both Nixon and JFK were excellent and both clocked in at over 3 hours. Platoon, Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July and Salavador are 4 of the best films of the 80's.
So how did he get Alexnder so badly wrong.
This is bad on so many levels. First the positives. This film is book ended by 2 really great battle sequences, the production design is excellent and Anthony Hopkins gives the only dramtic performance in the film.
No matter what version of the film you watch. The theatrical cut, Director's Cut or the Final Cut all 3 versions have the same issues. The acting and the awful accents.
Firstly. Alexander was not irish. Why on earth did Oliver Stone let Colin Farrell keep his irish accent is beyond belief. However, just as bad is how Val Kilmer who is Americam also speaks in an irish accent and Alexnader's mother played by an awful Angelina Jolie has a Russia/Romanian type accent.
For a film that needed to be historically accurate and dramtic this is also one of the most unintentionally funny movies you will ever see. The love making scene is so bad it's funny and most of the film has Alexander and his generals just shouting at each other in irish accents. It's like walking into irish bar and seeing drunks shouting at each other. The film is way too long, the charcters are completely bland, the dialogue is awful and the acting is utterly terrible.
No wonder Colin Farrell considered quitting acting after this.
Oliver Stone also has never recovered from this as he has not made a decent film since 1995's Nixon.
Avoid!"
"CinemaSerf","6","0","1","10 January 2020"," Worth a conversation, but maybe not about the film itself....
","Opinion on this film seems to have been hijacked somewhat by the definition and appropriateness of the relationship between Alexander (Farrell) and Hephaestion (Leto). It seems daft to try to apply 21st century social morals onto a society in which same sex relationships were simply unremarkable. Whether or not it was about sex, or love, or both isn't really that important - I think Oliver Stone was trying to involve us in a much more complex story of human nature. It may also be more of an Anglo-Saxon thing - men on Continental Europe from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean (and their N. American descendants) have a completely different, relaxed, view towards tactility amongst men. What this discussion does do successfully, however, is distract us from a pretty lacklustre effort at an epic. The film has grandeur and style but really does lack substance. It has all the grit of a beauty pageant. The script is wordy and weak, and characterisations way too shallow given we have effectively a blank canvas from which to work and an almost unlimited timeframe in which to tell the story. Inevitably, it does draw comparisons with Richard Burton and Frederic March's version from 1956 but not favourably; the all star cast here just doesn't really gel in the same way and the CGI isn't anywhere near as convincing as the real photography of the earlier iteration. Overall, a very well resourced missed opportunity to tell the tale of one of history's most enigmatic characters."

","I like epic movies especially when it involves history and human greatness. You have a topic here that qualifies however if one is to believe the movie, the subject matter namely Alexander was deeply flawed. The dysfunctions that he suffered from actually supplied the power and drive to do what he did i.e. to conquer and take over that which had never been done before just because he could. having cruel parents who specialize in crazy-making allowed his inner demons to flourish. The movie shows that after a conquest, he liked to return the situation to a status quo and one wonders why he bothered to in the first place. He lived a life of excess, irresponsibility, absolute power, sex-centered, alcoholic fueled daily existence that in the end contributed to his self-destruction. He set himself up to die so to speak. Why? He had no depth, meaning or purpose. Just an empty drive to succeed. He surrounded himself with people that supported his vanity and ego-centric comings and goings. He was not rare in that respect for history shows that all great men have peculiarities. The movie delivers these observations and more. The director comes from abundance when putting a story together which I consider a good thing. The actors each had good screen time to pitch their trade and did well. One thing though. I always notice that in certain movies like Braveheart, Return of the King, The 300, Troy and this one, the leader gives a speech to thousands of men and they cheer him on but for the life of me, how can they all hear what he saying? Only those within earshot get it which means about 100 at the most. Do the rest just do a ""wave"" and go along with the front group? I also had trouble with Alexander not taking the time to have many sons of which he had access to do. Again, this contributes to a self-sabotage theme for this conqueror. Oliver Stone did different versions of this movie and it gets confusing keeping track of it all. Was I glad I watched it? Sure. However, it is not something one wants to see again for it lacks the must see again scenes and has a lot of don't want to see scenes again in it as well.

","I liked this movie and could criticize it until tomorrow, but since I lack the time I want to put one positive and one negative thing out there:<br/><br/>1) Watching this with a lot of knowledge on Alexander's history it makes me wonder why the producers chose a guy who looks nothing, and I mean nothing, like the true Alexander did. <br/><br/>Firstly, it is a common misconception that he was blond when in fact he was actually dark featured, with dark brown hair. The actor doesn't have any phenotypes of a Greek man either (the aquiline straight nose is missing, he looks entirely British) which kinda ruins the vibe of connecting the actor to the character Alexander fully. <br/><br/>I could say this for the rest of the characters as well but they are not as important as the casting of the main character, which should've been much much better researched considering the amount of money spent on this movie. There must be a million Greeks who could've played the part way better suited.<br/><br/>2) I liked how they included the possibility of his death being by poison because historians actually still debate this till today. <br/><br/>The directors also showed his progressive ideas quite well which was also very nice to see in a non-documentary like movie.<br/><br/>Other than that it was a long and overall good movie that represented him quite well and was nice to watch.

He didn't rule through a throne room but rather through a battlefield where he slain many and witnessed many of his own being slain.

"cubsckc","7","0","1","8 July 2014"," Good but Lacking
","I don't want to alienate anyone, because essentially there are many components to the movie that people on both sides of the spectrum disagree with. It took me 10 years to watch it again and really see something worth liking. And as such, I actually started to appreciate some parts of the movie. However, one must admit that some parts and components really take away from the focus of the film. To be honest I watched it only once in 2004 and didn't watch it until it came on HBO. One thing that really turned me off was the homosexual part of the film. It wasn't because I hate gays, but because the warriors of the film were presented as girly men. I have no problem with a gay story as long as the story is realistic. I thought Colin Ferrel did okay... But one must think of the age they are in, in which these are actual rough warriors and not cute stars that know how to fight in combat more. I view the type of warrior I was looking for as something resembling 300 or Troy. But the characters were not realistic and completely flamboyant for veteran/rough warriors. The gay component actually had an interesting part to the story because it was referred and compared to Achilles in The Iliad. And as such, reflects differently as a show to demonstrate passion guided by selfishness or that of brotherhood. The Aeneid also tried to compare the differences, which I thought was interesting to point out on this film. I also think this is the main reason why people dislike this movie. There are many gay movies before this that have been rated better, but its the fact that we have hardcore warriors who are girly men. So in that sense, there was a bad selection of characters.<br/><br/>Another thing that took away from the main point was Angelina Jolie as his mother and Van Kilmer as his father being relived in his memory to explain his actions as a leader. Frankly, I thought the acting was poorly acted and most of the time unnecessary. I thought that this was a key reason along with the flamboyancy of the characters to distract from the main themes. <br/><br/>There were some neat parts to the film. The budget can be seen with the accuracy of the make up and designs, along with the battle scenes. The battle scenes were definitely better than I remember and relatively accurate. The only problem is that at times it was kind of confusing to tell what was going on. The relations between Alexander and Hephaistus along with Achilles and Patriclus is also something pretty neat to explain the difference between how a great warrior can self defeat himself with is own passions as well as contrary where they can rule the world. The props and customs through the film are very accurate and realistic, and the only thing that prevents this form being noticed and appreciated is the acting and distraction from the major points in the film. <br/><br/>I don't like acting single minded, however it does seem like this was a film that showed the biggest problem and yet folly of Oliver Stones career. With a great story available to him and a large budget, it shows that his creativity is to disorganized. I went from grading it originally from a 4 to an 8 because I really appreciated the military conquest more as well as the comparison with mythology. I also like the realistic approach to how his soldiers felt about over conquest and intermingling with other peoples. This is where the story really shines. However, for me the difference between a 7 and an 8 is usually opinion, which I fear may have reflected in my new decision. As such, I put it as a seven. It deserves over a 5 because it is entertaining, and even if you dislike the film, it still makes you watch at times. But there is also a good story there somewhere that was underdeveloped and deserved the 7."

Jolie - a lovely-to-look-at woman, playing Alexander's mom, (Mr.Farrell's age is not that far off from Ma. Jolie's) is pitiful. Whereas she could've been used as lovely eye-candy, or - if she wanted to (attempt) acting, she could've been used sparingly.<br/><br/>Instead, her lack of ability is the more apparent, as Mr. Stone devotes lots more screen time to talks between 'mother' and 'son.'<br/><br/>As for Mr. Hopkins, he's given narration duties - to help the viewer make some sense of the plot.<br/><br/>Mr. Farrell - who I mean no harm, is probably a nice guy, who happened to luck into being the male 'himbo' of that moment, and, if someone offered me the money, and screen time, I wouldn't have said no, either.<br/><br/>Alexander is not redeemable on any level: not as a historical,minor eye-candy.

","Oliver Stone's latest version of Alexander follows the King of Macedonia from childhood to adulthood, leading his men against the Persian Empire. He then pushes his army across the world further than any Westerner, but has he gone too far?<br/><br/>Stone revisits this historical epic, without the interference of the studio executives, critics and such gives him the opportunity to deliver his third and 'final cut' of Alexander. It's 213 minutes of bad road which isn't a negative,this only means it's a tougher journey but in an all terrain vehicle.  This is a longer, intense, more deeply explored version of the story and characters.  <br/><br/>It still contains the alleged faults of the previous versions, accents, wigs, casting etc. But these are easy targets for the casual viewer or critic. There are admittedly some larger than life performances, but there is also some great subtle and fine cameos from both Christopher Plumber and Anthony Hopkins. Leads and supporting cast include Jolie, Farrell, Dawson and Leto, to name a few who are all exceptional.<br/><br/>What you have is an epic film with a multitude of characters and story layers. Despite the supposed historical inaccuracies it is a well constructed and entertaining movie that has an understated score, great effects, sets, fantastic locations, make-up and costumes. Stone proves he is still at the top of his game, with every shot capturing a perfect moment in time. While less commercially glossy than Troy (2004), it is more in the tone of Ridley Scott's also criticised Kingdom of Heaven (2005).<br/><br/>All in all Alexander Revisited the Final Cut is a solid film of epic grandeur like the story of the man himself."

","I base this upon the 168 minute version. Maybe that makes it the Director's Cut... I inquired the cover of the DVD(which came only with the film, subtitles and scene selection), and was granted no answer. Well, this has divided people. Whenever Stone decides to have at the ol' history books with correction fluid, he's got students failing classes and teachers pulling their hair out as if they've just decided that baldness would look good on them, and they haven't the patience to go and acquire a shaving apparatus. I'm of the opinion that you simply shouldn't go with, well, *anything* you're told in a piece of fiction as being truth before checking it with a reliable source(no, Wiki doesn't count), and I try to judge these based on how entertaining they are. With that said, for the handful of inaccuracies this has, it is quite authentic. The production values are rich, with great designs. We get some pretty attractive visuals. For an epic of this scope, and on such a grand scale, to be this bold is impressive. I understand that many have been angered by the homo/bi aspect... since there is evidence to suggest that being the case for the man this is a biography of, and, you know, the small fact that in ancient Greece, *it was seen as completely natural*, I remain baffled by that response. To those who claim that this is tarnishing Alexander... if something is going to give a bad name to anyone, isn't the instant jump to the conclusion that gay=negative a better candidate? And if it isn't, shouldn't it be? I wasn't surprised by Oliver having the guts, but Farrell(who delivers a rather strong performance) and Leto(who is also amazing... isn't he always?), I didn't know to expect the courage from. The relationship between them is convincing, which cannot be said of all the others. Kilmer does well for what he's given to work with. I like that the British accents represent upper class, and other English ones signal lower ones in this. With that said, a few of the dialects can be all over the place(is Jolie trying to sound German? I think she's the only one on the planet who knows what she was going for with that). The acting tends to be solid, including most of that of the kids. Casting is hit and miss, and talents are wasted by being given next to nothing to do, and the screen-time to match(also, Christopher Plummer ought not to wear a toga... he can not pull it off with any dignity intact). Dialog is fine, if a little of it screams ""look, we did our research"". This comes off as real, with no excessive CGI, and things tend to have impact. The battles are bloody, brutal and seen up close, you can tell this is the guy behind Platoon(you *feel* the deaths). No, you don't know exactly who's winning(it's not the level of Star Wars Episode III, though), because no one in the midst of that situation does, except for when it is obvious; instead, you sense the chaos of it. Think of the landing sequence from Saving Private Ryan. There is a bit of racism and a tad of sexuality and female nudity in this. I recommend this to those looking for an enjoyable retelling of his life... for an entirely credible one, look elsewhere, of course. 7/10"

Going in, I expect it to be a story, embellished, dramatic. I don't want realism, and neither should anyone who watches this movie. If you want to know about Alexander the Great, you go read a history book.<br/><br/>The movie was said to be long, but it was excellent in its length. The portrayal of Alexander was said to be 'whiny' or pathetic. I think that's a personal, probably a modern, bias. I like to imagine an Alexander who wasn't afraid of emotions, like many people are these days. Besides, when I think of EXTREMELY charismatic people, not just fake-charismatic people, I think of emotional - because they have to connect with people. One of the reviewers here said it didn't feel like real conversation. Well it was obvious to me that it was the POINT of the story to have a series of monologues as a stylistic choice, attempting to make it seem more like an epic poem. It did exactly that, I thought.<br/><br/>There's also the comment that it overlooked Alexander's intelligence on the battlefield. While I agree, it did overlook his master-strategist aspect, it was intentional. Everyone knows he was a master strategist. The story was about his legend, the dream that people saw when they remembered him. He was that epic assault on the enemy. That single, solitary attack with complete abandon and complete faith that represented Alexander the Great, god among men."

","I find myself agreeing with almost all of the reviews here, from one star to ten stars. This could have been a great movie, with a different writer and director and star... However it is pretty close to an essential movie, so I recommend that you watch it. The extended wedding night scene on the Blu Ray release between Alexander (Colin Farrel) and Roxanne (the spectacular multi-ethnic Rosario Dawson) really crackles.<br/><br/>Stone missed on almost as many points as he hit, even in the Blu Ray ""Final Cut"" release, but it is an honest effort at a big topic. One may nit-pick it to death, but only after you've seen it.<br/><br/>I have watched it 3 times and do not regret those hours. That cannot be said of many movies watched only one time.<br/><br/>My first viewing was with Stone's commentary rather than on-screen dialog. It helped. The third was with the commentary by Oxford Professor Robin Lane Fox. Fox is author of a book on Alexander and on-set historical consultant to the film. They let him be one of a thousand extras in a big battle scene.<br/><br/>If one watches the included documentary by Stone's son, you get insight into Stone's relationship with his own parents which will give some significant insight into how this movie came to be what it is... as much about Oliver Stone as Alexander the Great of Macedonia.<br/><br/>The movie may seed your interest in Alexander, or give you glimpses at fairly good recreations of the art and architecture of those times.

"vip_ebriega","3","0","1","22 December 2008"," $100 million worth of turkey.
","My Take: Money alone can't buy decency in this plodding, overlong ""epic"".<br/><br/>$155 million in your pocket. Your director is Oliver Stone. Your stars are composed of what many might call Hollywood's beautiful people. And lastly, people are going crazy for big-budget war epics. So how can Oliver Stone go wrong in his epic-scaled Alexander. Nothing really, just possibly one of the most ponderous, most boring movie ever to have big cash to spare. Throughout its dragging 175 minutes (!), I prefer listening to my history teacher and get it over with at about, say, 30 minutes. No big deal though, not even I can survive this ponderous would-be epic. Halfway throughout the picture (or is that even halfway?), I switched off my TV screen and left. I'm just thankful that I didn't see this on the big screen! Bloated and overstuffed, Alexander is also made worse by the fact that it had the potential. Stone, possibly one of the finest and certainly one of the wealthiest filmmakers, is a walking history book. In his films, Stone always seemed certain that he knows exactly about who his subject is. He's knowledgeable and, best of all, bold in his vision. One one hand, he's going the right direction with Alexander. The scale is massive, and the detail, from the impressive sets (that'll do Cecil DeMille justice) to some costume design, are given exquisite attention. Throw in some fancy camera work and a popular cast list and you have a big-budget epic film-in-the-making.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Alexander turns real bad real fast as the film goes on... and on... and on. Worst of all, it moves sluggishly with hardly anything happening at all to anyone and anything. To throw in some ""excitement"" to the scene, Stone gives as some expensive battle scenes (aka the ""money shot"") to enliven up the experience, but it is put to vain as we are forced to drag about excessive babble and emphasis on Alexander's (an underwhelming Colin Farrell) homosexuality. You won't believe it 'till you see it! The cast is wasted. Angelina Jolie is forced to ham about as Olympias, Val Kilmer rarely has enough time to flex his muscles as King Philip, and Anthony Hopkins, forced to simply just read the script aimlessly as a subdued Ptolemy. So far as I've watched (though I think it wouldn't change a thing even if I watched the entire film), Alexander is a titanic bore. Big-budget film-making at its worst.<br/><br/>Rating: *1/2 out of 5."

","I don't know why so many rated this movie so bad but I shall continue with my honest take on this film.<br/><br/>Kay, this is the story of Alexander the great as interpreted by Oliver Stone. Well we have our hero seen growing up instilled with the lovely values of conquest instilled by his barbaric father and witchy mother. Well after growing up he went right through to the conquest for himself working on taking over most of Europe surpassing the travels of the gods and heroes themselves into lands previously unknown. Things eventually catch up to Alexander and well I'll try and save the rest for your viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>One of the issues in this film that I believe is responsible for some of the negativity relates to the whole gay sex angle. Well Oliver Stone wished to work on a historical statement basically saying that the people back then wern't as homophobic as we are now. He may have gone over the top but I don't think it was as overboard as everyone said it was. I didn't leave the film thinking ""ooh gay sex film"". I mean shoot people loved Brokeback Mountain and that showed way more in terms of gay relations than this film. Of course those of you who are major history buffs will not get to enjoy an exact history experience but I've learned since watching the Disney Version of Pocahontas that really a movie can be enjoyed without full historical accuracy.<br/><br/>If you like movies like Braveheart or Gladiator you will very much enjoy this film."

"Cosmoeticadotcom","5","0","1","6 September 2008"," Flip a coin
","Director Oliver Stone's film version of the life of Alexander the Great, came out to dismal reviews and worse box office. There were controversies over its portrayal of the bisexuality of its protagonist, as well as the poor screenplay, stilted dialogue, and many other things. We get the requisite battles, the CGI armies of huge hordes, but Stone's camera work is not what it was a decade or more ago. There is very little that sets this apart as an Oliver Stone film. It's a generic pseudo-epic that makes the great epics, like Spartacus, or Lawrence Of Arabia, seem that much greater. I guess there's just a simple lack of passion in the whole endeavor. What saves the film from being total trash, however, is Val Kilmer's relationship with Alexander- mostly as a boy (Connor Paolo), but also with the older Farrell. Kilmer's best moment comes when he demands buying a horse at half price if Alexander can tame it. The son, of course, tames it, in generic rite of passage form, but the key that makes this otherwise trite scene work is how Philip will to risk his son's life merely for a bargain. It shows why the two men will bond, but never be truly close. In short, Alexander fails not for many of the reasons the major critics roasted it (although to be fair, I don't know just how different the filmic and DVD versions are) but because it has too much breadth, and not enough depth. Accordingly- while not terrible, it's not great. Flip a coin over whether it's passable and either way you're probably right."

But when i saw it, i was disappointed.<br/><br/>I will make this as short as possible: this movie did not work very well because Oliver Stone turned a very complex historical character more complex and added a more complex storyline. That is the main flaw of this movie, and why it did not do as well as you could expect.<br/><br/>Alexander the great and his empire and conquest of the world is a very complex historical piece. This would be hard to translate to the cinema. Oliver Stone then adds a very complex childhood and father-mother scenario to the film. In its own, this would be a very cinematic piece. But when it is added to a complex storyline and a complex main character the movie kinda falls apart. The whole part of Alexanders Bisexuality is also a thing Oliver Stone could have toned down or just not included in the story. It combined with all the other complex element makes for a movie, which is not that well suited for cinema. This movie should have been half as long. It should have been centered around the conquest of the world, and not Alexanders bisexuality. <br/><br/>The battle scenes, music and pictures are very beautiful and well made in this movie. This movie could have been so much better, if they had just made a VERY simpler storyline and much simpler characters. Oliver Stone could then just have included the cinematic release on the DVD only, and released a simpler version of the film. <br/><br/>That is my critique. I was disappointed.

Lovely young Alexander's eyes convey his desire to move upward & he does, up the ladder & into bright sunlight. Apollo guides him. Re: comments about accents (Irish/Vlad) does anyone know what a Macedonian sounded like? Or a woman from the ""hill tribes?"" No, so why not Irish/Romanian? When I was growing up ALL the actors in Epic Movies (like Cecil B. DeMill's films) spoke British English & that's fine for back then. Stone had to make a decision & it works to have various accents (one General speaks w/a Scots accent, Ptolemy has a more refined accent--worked for me! Re: comments on man/man love in Ancient Greece. Women weren't generally considered equal to men, so only another man could satisfy one intellectually, physically, romantically. Women were for breeding although the unusual few were considered prophetesses or touched by the goddesses. Alexander's mother often covered his hair with gold dust, according to Plutarch so I thought this was one reason why Stone had A's hair golden. My husband lived amongst Afghani tribes & thinks the woman A married was from that area. My husband also lived in Persia/Iran & said the most beautiful women on earth are Persian. Stone obviously drew from the book ""Persian Boy"" amongst many other stories/myths/histories. I've loved Alexander since I was in the 4th grade & I am now 55. Colin Farrell was the absolute right choice to star as The Great. His acting will only improve as he works more and thank the Good Lord, he is a tireless worker.

The cynics who try to put Alexander in the same basket with other conquerors such as Genghis Khan - Mongol Conqueror, Attila etc, I think they could be wrong. Alexander's teacher was the great ancient philosopher Aristotle. He was a brave man with a child's heart. He did not go for gold or for power but for adventure and heroism as is depicted in his role models of Achillies and Heracles. The movie I think managed to exhibit this good trait of Alexander in a good degree. Alexander is an excellent example of what a humans can do if they have a dream and a vision. Nevertheless, Alexander may not have been a very happy man. Nobody explained to him what the real meaning of life is. Nevertheless he was a charismatic personality, a noble soul.

","I have not seen the film since it opened in 2004. The main reason was the very bad reviews I read mainly from movie-goers. After reading reviews from critics it cemented my opinion that I should wait for the DVD. But when the DVD came out, even then I failed to watch the film. The wind was taken out of my sails and I simply forgot about Alexander. Then I met Oliver Stone at a film festival and heard him speak passionately about Alxander. He told the audience that the Director's Cut was very good and everyone should watch it. And so finally I did. However, as the film started I had a deep sense of mistrust and prejudice (I still thought that 90% of movie-goers and critics can't possibly be wrong). Then came the surprise. I was really pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed watching the film. Although I admit that it dragged at times and the relationship between Alexander and his parents on the one hand and his bisexual lover on the other was a little overbearing, I still thought that triumvirate was necessary to make Alexander want to go forward and prove both his mom and dad wrong. That was the emotional backbone of the story. If Stone only focused on the military conquests he would have made a different film. This one has emotional depth and grit. On the other hand, I thought Colin Farrell was not up to the part. He played it way too laid back and conciliatory. He was too soft and at times feminine. But then he was wise and knew how to treat his conquered enemies. It was a tough part to play and he did a decent job (If I were Stone, I would have cast Jason Patric, who in my mind is one of the most under-appreciated actors in Hollywood). All and all, this was a very difficult subject matter and I truly think Oliver Stone did a great job at giving us his version of Alexander's life. As to the criticism regarding various accents, makeup, etc, I think they are baseless and petty. I thought the accents worked pretty well since the film was shot in English. I realized that a lot of the people didn't like the film watched it to find fault or had certain expectations that were not met. After all, Alexander the Great is widely known throughout history and there is so much written about him that what we know about him could be mostly myth. We envision him as a superb military commander with super human traits when in fact he was a human being who had many flaws. Kudos to Oliver Stone for sticking to his guns and making a film that, though not appreciated in its time, will certainly make future more sophisticated and smarter audiences (not the ones who rush to watch Blades of Glory and Spiderman 1,2,3) much happier and more appreciative."

Despite no historical proof, Alexander is BOTH gay and into interracial relationships despite what his people think. Given how Hollywood dishes out academy awards on the basis of representing their moral values rather than any merit, this one should have won TWO best picture awards in 2004.<br/><br/>This movie is also flawed with the sad reality that there is no reason to like the often spazzy Alexander.... but as per usual with Hollywood they over look trying to develop any true character so long as they can get their own cheers in for the character being politically correct. <br/><br/>Gay and interracial, but Hollywood apparently overcame it being TOTALLY politically correct by killing lots of animals in the fight scenes.

","Everyone went to the movie theater (including me) to see ""Alexander the Great"", it's time epic battles and huge armies of both sides. Yet we find ourselves watching a pure gay movie, it wasn't about ""Alexander the Great"" at all, but the life of a gay man. I was really, REALLY mad to see what they claim in there to be a historical fact, it was proved over and over again that man from those times were more attached to each other, they would kiss on the cheeks and hug, but in any mean would it be taken as homosexual, as the Movie itself shows, Alexander even married. The movie just twisted the history and because of that, it destroyed this titan and epic movie.<br/><br/>Sure, sure, if the writers and director want to say Alexander was gay just for the fun of it; Okay, but at least make the gay scenes a little lighter; this movie is very heavy on sexual and nudity, with both straight and gay sex, I find it completely unnecessary, it was only useful to generate a huge free publicity by the costs of the angry critics worldwide and to simply destroy the entire movie, because a lot of people just did not tolerate the idea (including me, I cannot see Alexander being gay) - Something you can clearly see by looking at the IMDb.com overall rating on an incredibly awesome and epic movie.<br/><br/>But seriously, if you can manage to watch this movie with a ""giant will"" to tolerate the straight and gay nudity/sex scenes, you will find yourself watching an amazing and incredible movie, Colin Farrel and Antony Hoptkins are acting inhuman in this picture, Colin Farrel should have won an Oscar for his acting, he is the perfect Alexander, it is a huge pity they made him gayÂ… that was a waste of talent, richness and character, terrible choice, terrible!!!! The sound is spectacular; the visuals are unique and show scenes never seen before; the battles and armies are just amazing, they seem to come out of the history books, it is like a trip to the past; the story is breath taking; the director did a superb job, superb but mediocre at the same time because of the destruction he allowed within the Alexander Character, terrible, terrible choice.<br/><br/>Eight out of ten, but it should have deserved an easy ten."

I know the film is made for the American market and that any non American accent is acceptable for that market, given that all English accents sound the same to them and especially after Dick Van Dykes sorry effort in Mary Poppins.

"reapz-1","1","0","1","30 July 2006"," What a missed opportunity
","I like Oliver Stone's work, some of his films are real favorites such as The People vs. Larry Flynt, Any Given Sunday, The Joy Luck Club, Salvador. I am also a history buff with particular interest in ancient military history. Thus when this film was announced I eagerly anticipated its release and came to view it bringing a fair amount of positive partisanship before I opened my $20 DVD.<br/><br/>However the fact is I couldn't even finish watching the DVD. I actually thought almost anything else I could do with my time (even falling asleep) would be a more constructive and pleasurable use of my time. I cannot remember the last time I stopped watching a film (after 2 hours) because it was nauseating to watch.<br/><br/>It is simply a bad film. Sorry but there is nothing redeeming in it. I read reviews by a number of people who liked it because Stone allegedly made a historically accurate film, used experts like Robin Lane Fox etc. Those people don't know what they're talking about. There are few extant primary sources that offer insights into the life of this military genius and all of them detail mainly military and political matters. The idea that Stone's film somehow accurately portrays Alexander's personal and family life is laughable. Those aspects of the film are an exercise in artistic license. The relationships between the characters are this director's creation not a historical fact. That by the way is fine - but don't argue we are supposed to like the film because of authenticity. Even viewed as fiction however it isn't interesting.<br/><br/>The tragedy IMO is that this enterprise had the money and the talent to make a great film about a fascinating life. Many people have little understanding of the ""great"" qualities of this man as a warrior general, a leader, a statesman. That is something they will emerge from viewing the film still understanding little. The battle of Gaugamela is the one part of the film where Stone tried to recount some military events. There is a reason that battle is first year teaching at military academies to this day. I'm not sure that it was clear to people from viewing this film what happened there. The exercise of military genius and the mixture of diligence in preparation, audacity and courage that marked Alexander's military career would be the most historically accurate aspects of a complicated life the director could have captured. This battle was certainly a part of the film where those themes could have been developed, but were not.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is not a crime that Stone didn't make the kind of film I might have enjoyed more. Something with more time on military and political adventures that are based in fact, with the character studies woven into that story. I don't expect a historical documentary, it is fine to make art. But it is boring and a failure as art as well as historically deficient."
"dan-1876","7","0","3","25 July 2006"," Excellent costumes and good battle scenes
","The costumes in this film were excellent - probably the most accurate I have seen in a film set in the ancient world. The Macedonian phalanx was very well done as well. They actually seemed to try to stay in formation during the battle rather than turning into an armed mob as in most films showing ancient battles. I was also impressed that the film correctly followed the general thrust of the historical story (though with a lot left out).<br/><br/>I also though that the acting was no where near as bad as the critics made out - much better than in Troy for example.<br/><br/>For me the main problem was trying to compress about three films worth of material into one film. This probably means that if you don't know the history very well it is hard to understand how all the episodes fit together into the overall story. It may have been better to concentrate on a shorter period rather than to cover the whole of Alexander's life."

","If they had cast Jared Leto (Hephaistion) as Alexander the film would have had a heart. Instead we get blood and guts.<br/><br/>It is difficult to understand the motivation of Alexander if you are going to be half hearted about his love for Hephaistion. You either need to be explicit or leave it to those in the know. A modern American audience might find the former hard to take in a macho battle epic, but it would not have shocked the ancient Greeks. The relationships that drive Alexander are those with his mother, father and Hephaistion. You can hear the Studio shouting at the Director - cut all that gay stuff the mainstream audience will find it a turn off. Unfortunately they are right. So Stone tries to fudge it and fails. Where he succeeds is in the battle scenes. The movie is wonderfully shot and scored. But without a heart you cannot be moved."
"badassjosh0076","10","0","9","21 May 2006"," Great Movie With Some Flaws
","I think some of you are being a little to hard on the movie. There were definitely some huge flaws in this film but overall it was a pretty good movie and totally captured the theme of that world.<br/><br/>One major flaw in the movie was its format and how it was edited. Why the heck 3/4 into the movie they flashback to young Alexander while Philip was still alive (and gets killed). The later flashback scene to when he was crowned king should have been put before his campaign toward the beginning while he was young. The movie would have flowed better.<br/><br/>Another major flaw was the amount of battles and Egypt. I thought the Battle of Gaugamela and the Battle in India was pretty good. However they should have added at least one more battle. Preferably it should have been the Battle for Egypt and the later founding of Alexander. If they did that the movie would have been complete. It sucks how they completely overlook the campaign in Egypt.<br/><br/>One final flaw was quite minor but it has to do with the overdone homosexuality throughout the movie. Now I have nothing against gays, but Alexander was always seen with feminine guys and this was overdone in India where he kissed a guy. The evidence for Alexander's homosexual side is shaky and the only evidence we have of his bisexuality was his relationship with Hephastian. With that said I am totally okay with his affectionate scenes with Hephastian as they were most likely lovers. But it was just too inaccurate to portray Alexander's gay side nearly all the time he was alone. In fact they show his gay side more than his straight side but he was most likely more straight than gay based on historical evidence. There were other inaccurate parts in the movie but something as controversial as sexual orientation shouldn't have been finalized so much.<br/><br/>I should stress that the homosexuality was a minor flaw. I think the American public and critics are too narrow-minded and focused on what their religion finds as evil than the good points of the movie. It doesn't surprise me that some Americans found the hugging scenes between Hephastian and Alexander as ""disgusting"" (I hug my guy friends all the time and I ain't gay).<br/><br/>Other than that it was a really good movie IMO. There is definitely room for improvement to match the true caliber of Alexander's life but as an overall movie it is still great."
"criztu","6","0","5","20 May 2006"," I will never question the quality of any of Oliver Stone's movies again
","heard few years ago Oliver Stone is making a movie with Collin Farrel and Angelina Jolie that speculates on Alexander's homosexuality; said to myself ""pfff, another of those phony ""historic"" movies trying to make money by showing some parts of the main actors bodies or some homosexual innuendos, throw some huge cgi armies against each other like hoses sprinkling water, and that will be it"". and didn't care watching it.<br/><br/>but today I felt I'd like seeing ancient soldiers fighting -was playing a mmorpg for a few days- and had Alexander at hand. gave it a try without expectations. movie started with Angelina Jolie (my expectations worsened); soon Val Kilmer steps into scene (at least I'll see some good acting from Kilmer, I can make it to the fighting scenes). watching the story unfold, switching from time to time to play the mmorpg, soon I realize the backgrounds, costumes, buildings and every image i focus my attention to are in harmony and believable.<br/><br/>soon i forgott about the mmo game, sucked in by the way the story of Alexander progressed. and the battle between persians and macedonians starts. wow, the fight is better then the starting scene from Gladiator. those phalanxes looked 80% phalanx, i don't know, hoplites? looked 90% hoplites, and every piece of armor, weaponry and clothes so diverse and real. soldiers, weapons and armor bearing marks of battles, not some ""card-board shields and plastic swords painted to look like they were aged in battle"". no ""metal_hitting_metal.wav"" when a sword cuts through flesh. no ""electric shock struck Chinese karatekas like"" soldiers hit to death by arrows. tho' the battle could have been more logical, it shown the effort to make it real, i could see them fighting in an organized chaos, not headless chicken like soldiers i can see in so many other ""historical movies"". <br/><br/>then I got my self carried on by Alexander's story. so well put that it even restored Jolie's and Farrel's actor status in my eyes.<br/><br/>the way I understood Alexander's story, most important thing in a human being's life is its starting position. they tell us from childhood that if one doesn't have proper ""training"" early in life, later on it's so much more difficult to avoid one's faith, and this movie shows it in a most convincing way. I couldn't find that weak point in the story that makes so many movies crumble.<br/><br/>i assume many of us think of themselves as great human beings but unfortunately born in unfavourable conditions, and if those conditions would have been accomplished, we would've made great deeds and things like that. this movie unfolded this scenario for me, and confirmed (again, i couldn't find a weak spot in this tale) that the ""favourable conditions"" are much difficult to obtain. born son of a king, poor Alexander was raised into a fighting machine with his mind twisted by myths, conquering Persia driven by his impregnated ""conquer the world"" pattern, lacking the balance that we all must look for (as Bertolucci's ""Little Budha"" so beautifully illustrates), and flawed from beginning by those ""starting premises"", he ultimately failed, submitting to the logic of the idea ""if a wood plank has a crack in it, 'tho' you can't see it, a karateka will easily finger-break it, mwhahaa"" or ""once a boulder starts rolling down hill, you cant stop it until it breaks into pieces at the base"" or ... but you know how life is.<br/><br/>by the end of the movie I was totally trapped in Alexander's world, felt sorrow for his army, wow-ed again at the Indians vs Macedonians fight scene, jaw dropped, head leaned against my hand and 10% tears in my eyes as i realized how powerful forces develop as consequence of our choices and decisions. Oliver Stones movie took me on a unexpected trip and bombarded me with symbols and images of life and mankind, that I even let the credits and music roll until the very end (no movie managed to keep me in that state)<br/><br/>an enriching experience this Alexander movie.<br/><br/>oh, and the barbarian Roxana, such a fine woman :D"

Stone's combination of history and action are perfectly matched which makes for an excellent account of the life of the founder of Western civilisation. To those who have heavily criticised this film - 'Alexander' was made not just as a piece of entertainment but as an account of history. I find it bemusing that individuals have taken it upon themselves to bad-mouth this film having no prior knowledge of the life of Alexander. This film is educational. If more people had a knowledge of antiquity the world would be better for it. 'Alexander' should be praised for it's historical integrity, not slandered because it cannot entertain the uneducated.

Usually my dad sleeps when he watches long movies, but he didn't sleep through this which means it doesn't get boring one bit. But what disappointed me was that it seemed like he cut out a few battle footage and made it less violent which was a bugger.

","I was looking forward to watching this film. Oliver Stone has known conflict and handles the battle scenes well. The sense of fear is seen in the eyes of the protagonists. The horror of the battlefield is seen in full detail. Not for the faint hearted. Colin Farrell is convincing as Alexander from boy King to full battle hardened General. The usage of an Irish accent to mark the Macedonians against the English accents of the Greeks was distracting at first but I soon got used to it. However this leads to too many parallels with Braveheart for my liking. Oliver Stone admits that little is know about Alexander. I suspect a little too much of the Celtic fighter from Scotland was allowed to guide the hand of the director. Angelina Jolie is competent as Alexanders mother, Olympias. Val Kilmer is over the top as his father, Philip. Still very enjoyable. If you like your sword and sandals long this is the one for you."
"MVictorPjinsiste","7","0","4","14 March 2006"," A Magnificent Waste of History
","""Alexander"" is no easy film to analyze, for it have many clashing elements. Stone wanted to film something about Alexander, yet he had no idea what he wanted to communicate.<br/><br/>Examples. Old Ptolemy (Hopkins) begins the movie rather well, using proved narration skills to present the politico-geographical situation of the time (with a contemporary map) for the average viewer's benefit, yet the sequences with Alexander himself were more about his sentimental life, personal relations and superficially explored philosophy about establishing ""civilized"" hegemony. No history, no politics there, no word on his handling of the conquest itself. As if the scenes with Hopkins were done as an afterthought to cement the rest.<br/><br/>Another one; In such a life rich with strategical genius, Stone chose to show only two battles, barely referring to some other ones. But the battles themselves were magnificent, having the scope of LOTR's mass scenes, coupled with grim, historic realities. He demonstrate that battles quickly becomes a form of restrained chaos, yet he is able to show strategy; You can follow Alexander's companions running for the breach in Darius' army as they race to catch with their own wing by looking on their faces. I don't remember a battle filmed as efficiently, as intensely (don't under-estimate Vangelis' score for that, neither). But the viewer will have to content for only two of these, Gaugamela and the Hydaspes River. The rest of the movie is largely devoted to boudoir scenes.<br/><br/>The acting is admittedly a bit of a problem; I felt no respect for Philip of Macedonia, camped as a bumbling drunk with no principles. Jolie definitively had an annoying accent. And overall, Farrel, a good actor by all means, was definitely too small for the role, being far to emotional and whiny to portrait the leader Alexander must have been. However, supporting actors such as Gary Stretch (as Cleitus the Black), Rosario Dawson (divine as Roxanne) and Jared Leto (in the difficult role of Hephaisdion) light up the screen.<br/><br/>On this subject, The bi-sexuality aspect was well-handled. maybe a bit over-focused, thought. It does show that this was not the taboo it still is today.<br/><br/>But the thing that got me into this film was its magnificence. To enter Babylon, to see its suspended gardens. To live the Hydaspes River battle through the feverish, delirious eye of the wounded, the costumes, the makeup (the Persian warriors did have an over-developed sense of cosmetics) really are eye candy; We have no problem at all being transported back to these epic times.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is one of the best Antic history movie filmed these days, mainly because both silly ""Gladiator"" and over-indulgent ""Troy"" did not set the bar too high. This film is infinitely superior.<br/><br/>It just lack a bit of focus."

And Colin Farrel is becoming one of my favorite actors after seeing this and ""The New World"". The only problem i have is that they chose Angelina Jolie to play Alexanders mother, she looks way too young to fit the part.<br/><br/>Direction was superb, as well as the music and the war scenes. Val Kilmer was very good as King Phillip. What I loved about this movie is that it showed what could have driven Alexander to do what he did in a very emotional way. It doesn't show him as some tyrant who had no goal in mind but to plunder and conquer the world. We have no way of knowing what kind of person he was in real life, but this could very well be it. <br/><br/>It is very probable that he was bisexual, because that was the way of the Hellenistic culture in ancient times. Men were supposed to be with other men because women were evil. Women were only good for making children. I am not making judgment on them, only reporting some of what we know of these people and their culture.<br/><br/>It is a very good movie, and I really recommend it to everyone, especially if you like ""Braveheart"", ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Gladior"" type movies, and to anyone who is a fan of Alexander the Great."

Having said this, I think the critics are far tougher on this film than they should be.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie does seem a little ""incomplete"", but for that to be fixed, it should probably have lasted over 10 hours! Other than that, this is a very well directed film (as usual, Oliver Stone's action scenes are amazingly realistic and well made), a relatively accurate, honest historical reconstruction with some excellent cinematography, special f/x, soundtrack and some great acting! This is a hell of a lot more than most recent Hollywood productions can claim for themselves.<br/><br/>To sum up, yes, the film has many flaws, which if fixed would have made it into a masterpiece, but we cannot denigrate it because it is 'only' a good movie instead."
"phenomynouss","10","0","9","21 February 2006"," With all its flaws and everyone's hatred, I simply love it
","I was impressed when I first saw Alexander on the screen. This was before I was obsessed with ancient Greek and Roman history. Then re-seeing it, I fell in love with it, original theatrical cut. The Director's cut was okay, but not better than the original.<br/><br/>I recently recognized the flaws which detracted some people from it, such as lack of characterization of some of the minor characters, a seeming characterization of Alexander based on his flaws rather than his greatness, and so on. However, I don't think this is enough to detract my intense love for the movie.<br/><br/>I think Oliver Stone is a cinematic genius, and it shows in his work like Platoon and Natural Born Killers. The direction is brilliant, and the incredible detail put into cinematography, costumes, and sets is simply epic on its own scale.<br/><br/>The Battle of Gaugamela sequence is pure brilliance, and I believe the most accurate ancient battle portrayal in all Hollywood. Aside from occasional lapses in which a Phalanx is broken apart, men fight in formation, rather than wandering around the field on their own, picking on-on-one ""The Mummy Returns"" style battles.<br/><br/>The acting is perhaps some of the best I've ever seen. Colin Farrel dissolves so fully into his role, that it's impossible for me to see the man playing Alexander as the man who played a slick New York agent in ""Phone Booth"", or a deadpan bald villain with a raspy voice in ""Daredevil"". Val Kilmer so fully becomes Philip of Macedon that you can't see him doing any other role. He's no longer Val Kilmer underneath the scarred eyelid and thick beard, he's Philippos II of Makedon.<br/><br/>The lesser-known actors, Jared Leto who plays Hephaistion, Gary Stretch who plays Cleitus the Black, and all the others playing the likes of Crateros, young Ptolemaios, Nearkhos, they are so fluid in their roles that they could quite possibly be the actual characters they portray, Irish and British accents and all.<br/><br/>The ""Clash with Cleitus"" scene is so thickly potent with chemistry between Farrel and Stretch (Cleitus) that it sends shivers through my spine listening to how these two rail at each other, and how literate, yet scathing and understandable Cleitus is. His vocabulary is like poetry, like Sophokles' writing, and yet his message is so simple and human that it's universally understood, even if you don't speak the language.<br/><br/>Inaccuracies aside (they had to cut and condense scenes for time, including a simplification of the Battle of Hydaspes, which Stone himself acknowledges, due to the vast complexity of the actual battle), it's one of the more accurate Hollywood movies about Ancient Greece, and an epic in its own right. Love it or hate it, it IS an epic.<br/><br/>The Final Cut expands upon it even more, and re-arranges scenes so that the lead-up to the Battle of Gaugamela comes first, after the scene of his death and Ptolemaios (Ptolemy)'s brief introduction. Scene re-sorting aside, new scenes show a more benevolent Alexander, working to bring Phoenicians in to build Babylon's shallow water harbor, granting gifts to his friends and soldiers, freeing Darius's harem slaves and eunuchs, granting great honors on his conquered enemies, including a scene with Oxyhartes(sp), father of Roxane. Important scenes, such as the clash with Cleitus, are expanded with more dialogue, more action before and after scenes to provide a more solid foundation for the coming events, and such, adding more depth to some, and more reasoning to others.<br/><br/>The Final Cut doesn't radically change the movie, but it solidifies some shaky foundations, and fixes some, but not all, of the flaws with the original cut. The subplot with Cassander and Roxane, mentioned by Stone in the original commentary, is missing, as is the conflict with Cleitus and Hephaistion."
"kelcey_jc","10","0","9","21 February 2006"," Excellent Movie
","For the life of me I can not figure out why so many people think so negatively of this movie. It had excellent actor: Colin Ferrel, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, etc. It had an excellent plot filled with Alexander's turmoil and lust for conquest. The movie had it all and I do not understand why so many people seem to hate it.<br/><br/>I fear that the movie after so much hype came at a bad time. To many people expected an action packed fantasy, much the same as lord of the rings. However, Alexander goes above and beyond.<br/><br/>However, the main reason I believe the movie suffered so much, was because of Alexander's suspected homosexuality. In that time it was very common for men to have relations with both men and females, and I personally believe that the movie portrayed that view well and discreetly. This movie lacked any homosexual sex scenes while still driving a powerful love between to men home. It was done with class and grace and I do not know many non homosexual men that would be offended by the way the movie portrayed it.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the movie to anyone who wishes to see an amazing movie!"
"farconej","9","0","8","16 February 2006"," Love it.
","This movie is so superior to Troy that it isn't even worth debating. On my first viewing of Alexander, I must say I was impressed, if only because the film's reputation is so maliciously poor; I was expecting nothing but a rotten, stinky piece of claptrap. Things bothered me -- Vangelis' score, initially, felt far too pompous (especially the first 1/4 of the film) -- there were too many moments of obvious overacting -- I didn't care for the transition from the battle in India all the way back to the sequence following Phillip's death. But, I was impressed -- both visually and in the way the story generally developed; it was interesting and quite absorbing, despite some obvious flaws.<br/><br/>Now let me get this out -- I'm not a history major. The comments made here about the film's historical inaccuracy, I cannot deny, and quite frankly I would be inclined to agree with them. Alexander, from the very, very little I know, was supposed to be a great warrior, and this is not portrayed. Likewise, Stone makes him out to be quite a progressive leader, mixing the races and all that jazz... Didn't buy it, especially since the hints at his ideals and an implicit sense of being ahead of his time were obvious and trite.<br/><br/>That being said, I enjoyed this film merely as a work of fiction; a good story, absolutely ""sensational"" visuals, and an absolutely brilliant score by Vangelis. Acting that, overall, is more intense and believable than most the crap Hollywood releases these days; and editing that, while far from consistent, made for some of the best cinematic moments I've seen in quite a few years.<br/><br/>So, the cinematography.. Don't think I need to elaborate on this; even many naysayers agree it's beautiful. Shocking to me, however, was how I found Vangelis' score to be out of place initially, but eventually keen and eloquent -- pitch perfect for quite a number of scenes. For example, the first battle sequence; beginning with some poor, unmelodic nonsense on synth (the worst bit of writing in the film), but evolving into a brilliant, minimalistic drum pattern, with (admittedly clichÃ©) exotic vocals on occasion. It eventually proves to be boldly climatic and utterly satisfying within the context of the entire sequence. Furthermore, his themes are INCREDIBLY grandiose; shameless in their epic nature, but all the better for it. Inparticular, shining moments include the cue when Alexander first tames Bucephalus (ironically the moment that irked me most upon first viewing), and the entire sequence in India. When Alexander and his calvary charge about midway through the fifteen minute sequence, and the camera pans from a close shot of Alexander to a distant shot of him and his calvary -- Alexander screams ""Come Macedonians, RIDE... RIIIIIIDE!"" -- it quite honestly sends shivers down my spine. In that time span of three or four seconds, Stone captures more spirit than a lot of films can muster in an entire running time. It's just utter, cinematic greatness, and that's the only way that I can state it. Unbelievable. Only a few moments later -- following Alexander's charge, rise and fall against an elephant -- there are more of these lavish, gorgeous scenes. Again -- and I only go into detail in hope that others who like the film (or rather, love it) will relate with glee -- it is a pitch-perfect combination of stunning, artistic photography and motifs from Vangelis that put other composers to shame (and I adore many a film composer). As Hephaistion and Bucephalus fall, the film shines brilliantly again -- completely and utterly striking, expressive, raw, and tender... Despite the film's general lack of emotion, the scene melts the heart and inspires with it's passion.<br/><br/>On the downside, the film's psychological perspective on Alexander is not incredibly interesting, nor is it subtle. There is an enigmatic presence to Farrel, but I'm not sure if it was intended or the fact that there's very little consistency to his character period. Consequently, the film isn't too emotionally captivating, despite the fact that certain scenes do envelope.<br/><br/>But basically, this film has become a favorite of mine. It's not perfect -- no way -- but it's epic, it tries and it both fails and succeeds. But it feels so passionate, so heartfelt in the intent of almost everyone involved, that I can't possibly dismiss it. In fact, I always feel compelled to stand up for it and recommend it. Unfortunately, too many post-modern lemmings have no eye for art, music, or aesthetic. Such is the world we live in, unfortunately.<br/><br/>(That being said, I'm not one to criticize those that dislike the film -- some of my favorite critics loathed it... From what I've observed, however, I just don't think a lot of the naysayers express much sign of intelligence and, as a result of that, validity.)"

"Buddy-51","5","0","1","26 January 2006"," lumbering epic
","""Alexander"" is a handsome but clunky attempt to duplicate those sword-and-sandal epics of the past. Although the screenplay gets many of the details of Alexander's biography right, the movie fails to being the character himself to life, thanks, primarily, to flat writing and a wooden performance by Colin Farrell, who turns the 4th Century B.C. Macedonian leader - who pretty much single-handedly changed the course of Western civilization - into little more than a whiny, teary-eyed mama's boy (and the actor they've chosen to portray Alex at 11 looks so much like little Mark Lester in ""Oliver"" that I half expected him to break out into a chorus of ""Where Is Love?"" before his part was over). None of the other characters make much of an impact either, although Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, his scheming, diabolical mother, turns in a scenery-chewing performance that is at least fun to watch. Anthony Hopkins brings his trademark pomposity to the role of Ptolemy, historian and narrator of the tale, lending an air of urbane pretentiousness to the film.<br/><br/>Almost the only thing of interest in the film is the surprisingly forthright way in which Stone deals with Alexander's long-recognized homosexuality, as reflected in his lifelong devotion to the pal of his youth, Hephaistion. Many filmmakers, aiming for the kind of mainstream audience a film of this budget and size demands, would have simply sidestepped the issue. It's true that the one full-on sex scene is between Alexander and his Persian wife, but Stone at least leaves us with little doubt as to where Alexander's true inclinations lie.<br/><br/>For the most part, though, this is a surprisingly conventional and even conservative film for director Stone. Missing are the human insights and fancy directorial flourishes we've come to expect from the maker of ""Platoon,"" ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" ""Nixon,"" and ""JFK"" (although the unsubstantiated conspiratorial ending reminds one of ""JFK""). The dialogue is generally pedestrian and prosaic, and the story dawdles when it most needs to move on. The battle scenes are fairly scanty and redundant, although the sight of a herd of elephants charging through the forest as part of an Indian army is mighty impressive.<br/><br/>At just a hair shy of three hours, the director's edition of ""Alexander"" is a mighty long haul indeed."

","I was looking forward to watching Alexander when it was released on the big screen, but unfortunately, my friends didn't want to see it because they heard such bad reviews on Alexander, so I went and saw it myself. I was really impressed on the magnitude of this movie. At 175 minutes, it was a long ride but I thought an interesting one. When I heard that Oliver Stone was releasing a Director's Cut on DVD. I was really looking forward to it. In Australia the Director's Cut version is only available on DVD, lucky I saw the Theatrical Version on the big screen.<br/><br/>I must admit, I really prefer the Theatrical Version over the Director's Cut. The Theatrical Version actually made more sense than the Director's Cut. I always assumed that Director's Cuts on film are longer, but this was 8 minutes shorter. I really didn't like the Director's Cut, it seemed disjointed and actually did not make sense.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Oliver Stone's, but I have to say that this is a good movie, not great. The performances in the movie are almost top-rate. The highlight performance on this movie was Angelina Jolie, gorgeous (as always), and of course got the accent right for the role of Olympias. Colin Farrell is decent as Alexander, but unfortunately, the Irish accent did not help with his performance. But unfortunately, there was one bad performance from one great actor. Val Kilmer gives the worst performance of his career as Alexander's father Phillip.<br/><br/>All in all, Alexander had great visuals, a brilliant music score by Vangelis, some great actors and the result all in all a good movie.<br/><br/>The Theatrical Cut 8/10

"joseph952001","10","0","11","9 January 2006"," A Classic For The Futrue
","The reason I call this movie a classic for the future is that it will never fully be appreciated until years into the future. This happens to many movies such as Casablanca, or The Wizard of Oz. In their initial release these movies and others were never very big money makers nor appreciated for what they were until years gone by, and now they are considered classics. The same thing will happen with Alexander.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to comment on this movie without getting too involved so let's just take Alexander's love life and comment on that. Alexander and his lover were gay. There is no doubt about that. Even though he was required to give his heritage a son, that doesn't make him straight or bisexual. Remember when the two were on the balcony, and Alexander said to the young man that it was he that only trusted and that it was he the only one that he loved, and it was vise-versa with Alexanders lover. The proof in the pudding is the tent scene where Alexander gets into bed. The look on his face and the shadow appearing to him was all that needed to be said, plus when Alexander's lover died. That was a powerful scene of one loosing his only love in the world to death! In many ways this was the same as David and Jonathan and their gay love relationship in the Old Testament recorded in Samuel I and II. Jonathan was willing to do anything for David and the both loved one another. When Jonathan dies in battle, David sings his greatest lament to this dead lover by saying that ""Your love to me was wonderful, surpassing that of woman!"" Then later, just as Alexander was King, David became King David of the House of Israel! Many gay men have been forced by family and society to produce an heir, but their hearts are always with their male lover. This applies to David, Jonathan, Alexander and Alexander's male lover. This is nothing new; it still goes on today! In the future, Alexander, the Director's Cut, will be appreciated for what it truly is and always be: A classic!"
"missperkigoth","5","0","4","5 January 2006"," Almost, but not quite
","The film wasn't that bad, especially if you only have cursory knowledge of the history. I couldn't care less about the sex involved, but Oliver Stone failed to present the cultural background on this. Greek men (as Alexander wanted to be) took on boys (normally teenage) to train them to be men. Sex was often involved. BUT NOT LIKE THIS. The tragedy of this movie is the Stone was on the right path, but didn't do enough follow through to make it historically accurate. Anyone with a background in Classics or Ancient History will be thrown off by little details, so die hards may not want to go there. At least it is closer to the documented history than Troy, and for that I am grateful."

"MaxBorg89","7","0","9","13 November 2005"," Overly ambitious and uneven, but worth a look
","People didn't like this movie mostly because of Alexander the Great's bisexuality. Frankly, I find it ridiculous, since in ancient Greece ""bisexuality"" was not only frequent, but also accepted. Moreover, there's only one actual sex scene in the movie, and a pretty laughable one at that, featuring Alexander's (Colin Farrell) tormented wedding night with his wife Roxane (Rosario Dawson). The incriminated moments, namely the Great's ""affair"" with childhood friend Hephaestion (Jared Leto), are very chaste, all based on looks, not even a kiss. Those scenes are a bit awkward, that's true, and you might think one such sequence would have been enough, but the ""gay scenes"" are actually the least significant of Alexander's many problems.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why Oliver Stone wanted to make this ambitious film: like most of his work, it's a story of power, paranoia and conspiracies (JFK, anyone?). This is evident from the beginning, when Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), the movie's narrator, remembers Alexander's childhood (the film's most even section, albeit too short): the young boy is constantly prepared to become king of Macedonia, by practicing horse riding and receiving a proper education from the famous Aristotle (Christopher Plummer). Nonetheless, his life is far from happy, courtesy of his parents: king Philip (Val Kilmer, a riotous but underused presence) is a drunken, foolish tyrant who will even get married three times in order to make friends with the right people; queen Olympias (a scene-stealing turn from Angelina Jolie) is a cruel, manipulative woman, frequently surrounded by snakes and eager to get her husband out of the way. In fact, when the king is murdered, she doesn't mourn him at all (and conspiracy theorists will happily feed on this).<br/><br/>With two individuals like those raising him, it's no wonder Alexander decided to leave his home and conquer most of the then known world, a masterful task he fulfilled before suddenly and mysteriously dying, aged 33 (the movie actually opens with that scene, played in slow motion). And it's in telling this part of the story, which occupies most of the film, that Stone exceeds in his ambitions, just like his subject did: the director feels completely at home when he's staging the massive, chaotic, gory battle sequences, but there are only two of them in a movie that's almost three hours long, and he fails to inject the same energy and enthusiasm in most of the scenes showcasing the Great's last years, when the almighty conqueror becomes a paranoid loner. It also doesn't help that Colin Farrell never fully manages to shake off his ""bad boy"" image (and his Irish accent), something that gives a ""camp"" feel to certain moments. This also occurs when Stone starts hinting at an incestuous affair between Olympias and Alexander, a suggestion that brings the mother/son scenes to the brink of the ridiculous, courtesy of excessive shouting from Farrell and too many ""evil"" looks from Jolie (Stephen Frears pulled off a much better job handling the same theme on The Grifters).<br/><br/>Still, this movie is worth watching: it may not be Stone's best, but when he really nails it, he makes you understand what a fascinating and unique man Alexander the Great was.<br/><br/>6,5/10"

It puts the advantages of modern age zoology into perspective: Man is no monkey. And vice versa.<br/><br/>The film gets around the Greek angle to human sexuality rather smoothly.

Personally I enjoy anything historic involving world changing events and I can't understand why anyone wouldn't? I found the level of detail, not just in terms of the events themselves, but the research/creativness that took place in building the Amry strategies and tactics was incredible, yet someone without an interest in this area would not have picked up on. I was also blown away by the incredible locations that were created, again admiring the eye for detail(Babylon comes to mind).<br/><br/>Theer were of course a few issues with the films, notably some of the acting I felt let the film down in some areas, but overall I cared for the characters and found them all to have a certain depth and authenticity about them.<br/><br/>In general, this film is not for everyone - evident by extremes in reviews given by various people.

","I thoroughly enjoyed Oliver Stone's epic.<br/><br/>I had first read about the story of Alexander The Great over 20 years ago, and as a history buff that I became, that story was never trumped by any other for its sheer achievement and amazement.<br/><br/>It's a big story, too big to fit all in one movie, so Stone had to cut out many elements, such as the Godian Knot, the siege of Tyre and Alexander's visit to Egypt with him being declared the son of a god by the priests of Amun'Ra. However, he captured enough for us to understand Alexander's motivations, and the complicated relationships between his mother and father that were at the heart of them.<br/><br/>I liked the way that Stone used Ptolemy to tell the tale, and in being reminded of Ptolemy, we were reminded of how much Alexander had achieved amongst other things - the creation of a new golden age in Egypt (that only ended with the death of Cleopatra).<br/><br/>The themes in the movie are still relevant today, with Stone touching upon Alexander's desire to unite east and west, something we are still trying to do today, and failing, just as Alexander's successors ultimately did.<br/><br/>I thought the film was beautifully set, and whilst the acting was not Oscar-winning, was not poor. You can't get Oscars for epics because the style of these movies is what it is, ""epic"", with a sense of melodrama always.<br/><br/>Telling the tale of Alexander is always a difficult task. Top marks to Stone for achieving what he did, of creating a moving, exciting and though-provoking re-enactment of history's greatest adventure story.<br/><br/>8/10"

I wasn't disappointed, I can tell you that. I thought the movie was wonderful, and just well written. I don't agree with homosexuality, but I have to say that the movie did well in not running away from the truth of Alexander. I know that in real life he was attracted to men, being normal for all men in the Greek culture in that time of history. So summing up everything, the movie was great, and what made it even better was having placed Vangelis as the composer for the score of the movie. Great Job.

"bkburk","10","0","9","2 October 2005"," Good movie, but a bit confusing
","The movie, in my personal opinion, is great, but it causes confusion in some parts. <br/><br/>Number One: <br/><br/>I don't think that there was any real form of love between hephitsion and Alexander. they had a friendship that was pure, it was a love that would be shared between two brothers. I think that it exists today but guys like that are more prone to slap each other on the back, punch each others shoulders and watch football. less likely to hug and kiss on the cheek. However, i was curious as they entered the harem of the old king and the man who was no-question-about-it gay, seemed to share a moment between alex. And even more alarmed when they had sex in the middle of the movie. But it think it was just the directors way of showing the sexual freedom of ancient Greece. They call the Persians barbaric and themselves classy but they still have homosexual public displays. Alexanders sexuality is questioned further in the movie but it left up to the viewer to decide just whats going on.<br/><br/>Number two: Olympias (angelina Jolie, alex's mother, is questioned about the murder of his dad Philip (val kilmer). Apparently, he had a second wife who had a son. Olympias believed that Philip would make that child his heir, send Alexander on some impossible mission where he'd die, and have herself killed. So it's questionable whether or not she paid for the assassination or if it was done by the king of Persia, as rumored. I personally think that it wasn't her. the look on her face showed distress at first, until of course she realizes that her son is the new king. <br/><br/>there are more situations but you'll have to watch the movie to see for yourself ! :D~ Alexander is a great movie and i recommend you to see it."

","Oliver Stone's epic film 'Alexander' proved to be a relief after watching. The critical reviews that I had heard made me anxious to watch. With my expectations lowered I expected very little in the way of directing and acting. This was only partially true, with half the cast speaking in an unmasked Irish accent and others attempting all sorts of foreign accents gave the film a sense of disorganisation within the drama. Moreover, as a historical epic this film falls down, it is merely too condensed and many ways altered to fit the screen to be historically reflective in the slightest sense. Placing all of this aside though, the cinematography coupled with exquisite and opulent scenery makes this film a visual treat. This is not to say that the plot lacks any stimulation. Alexander is focused upon as a chaotic leader who exists between feuds and his own mental torture of fear of assassination (and thus death, heavily emphasised upon). We may also notice the great emotion of Alexander's journey as we feel we are entering the ends of the world, the never-before-explored parts and he urges his men to follow him in his journey to create for him own myth. The battles are chaotic, bloody and truly epic the landscapes magnificent and powerful, there is no reason why this film should not be seen and I fear it is heavily under-appreciated and underrated, this film must be taken for what it is a beautiful film which unfortunately bears little historic relevance, there is yet to be made a film which may portray Alexander's life and conquest whilst equalling this film's many allures, though in that case prepare for a true historic epic which may be at least 6 hours long!"

","I never saw this film at the cinema, so I had to settle for renting the DVD. I'd heard how drawn out it was and how muddled some of the historical data was and didn't really find either situation to be true. Colin Farrell is one hell of an actor (if people can separate the boozing, womanising guy he is in reality from his craft) who doesn't always get the respect he deserves. I was a little sketchy on the idea of Angelina Jolie playing his mother but she came through brilliantly, chewing up the role and making it her own. After awhile, it wasn't Jolie PLAYING a part, she BECAME the part. She's another good actor who's personal life often overshadows her ability. Val Kilmer is always good, and it was wonderfully refreshing to see both Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer on screen again. Jared Leto also was a pleasant surprise in the role of Hephaistion, bringing a cool, low key presence to the part. I'd read a comment somewhere that having the actors use an Irish accent was silly but I didn't notice it after awhile. It seems that when North American accents are used or even English accents, it's more accepted. Again, after awhile, you don't really notice it and it DOES keep some continuity amongst the characters and their nations of origin and so forth. Good film, good action, great acting."

It is long but it is definitely worth it and it deserves to be watched especially because its Oliver Stone and he is such a great director. Once again I thought this movie was made well done and had a lot of time and effort put into it and even though it may not be an Oscar winner its a great movie."
"jeanmariefrancoeur2000","9","0","10","20 September 2005"," Art masterpiece
","Alexander by Oliver Stone is one of the most beautiful film I ever saw.The art dept really did a fantastic job not only in truthful recreation of the past, but also in inventing the costumes and props of long gone civilizations and tribes that left almost nothing materially.The incredible precision and accuracy of the sets and costumes in breathtaking. I believe they based there research on the writings of Plutarque, the most descriptive book we have on this half-God. The screenplay is very close to the real story. I have only two reserves; First, the man-to-man sexual relations were not like today, cruising cute guys with smiles and civility. They were generals and soldiers fighting and killing all day long.Their intimate relations were more about masculine enhancement and virility, measuring strengh and loyalty.<br/><br/>The other one is the blond hair of Alexander. We know from the mosaic in Lybia that he had paler streaks in his hair. But to make him a blond person reveal the influence of the German history of Alexander written in the '30."

","I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this film! It's rough, raw, & heartwrenching, elaborately thought out & deeply layered with profound & eloquent philosophical symbolism concerning the contradictory dualities found in nature, love, warfare, religion, lust, loyalty, family, identity, fate, free-will, & life purpose. It is lush with gorgeous sweeping camera-work, creative & intensely shot hand-to-hand & calvary battles, & stunning realistically raging dialog. The passionate Bactrian & Persian dancers & Indian war elephants ignite the film with exotic splendor.<br/><br/>Oliver stone synthesized every conflicting ethical, mythical, & familial influence that would have played on Alexader's blazingly hot passionate brain, & showed him agonizing to reconcile so many deeply powerful & volatile Promethian desires for the ultimate hope & betterment of mankind, driving him to the brink of insanity as he plunged forward into history, forever seeking glory yet running from his demons. I found this film to be like nothing I've EVER seen before-- and yet still deeply human & incredibly true to representing every single historically relevant point of view of the time-- mutually exclusive views with which Alexander wrestled so fierely. I'm appalled & disgusted by the negative & simplistic reviews of the film from people who can't grasp what this film is saying on so many levels. This is a divine gem, beyond the reach of those who were expecting a simple warrior's action flick. It's not a film for the simple-minded. This is absolute & pure genius, tip of the top, cream of the crop regardless of any irrelevant & minor pacing ""flaws."""
"Southern_Cross","10","0","9","16 September 2005"," Not your typical Epic
","People who claim this movie is a disappointment are probably expecting a superficial cartoon-like epic such as Troy or Gladiator. This movie on the other hand does not have a simple story.<br/><br/>It presents a new take on plausible events in the life of Alexander the great, conveying his dreams and ideas. The style of Oliver Stone is recognizable in the visions and flashbacks, something that might put down Troy fans, but that certainly adds character to the movie. The visuals of the movie are absolutely amazing. The Battle scenes with Darius are very well done and the battle in India conveys so much power. I would have liked to get a little bit more insight into the Persian Empire. To know better the allies Alexander made among them. But to go into this other dimension in an already 3-hour long film would be asking for too much. Hopefully a future DVD version will include these extra scenes :) <br/><br/>In summary I found this movie the best I have seen among the movies based on Ancient Greece or Rome. A definitively must see for Oliver Stone fans and for history enthusiasts.<br/><br/>P.S. Reviewers should get over the ""Alexander being gay is an insult"". Besides, the movie has so many other dimensions that people only focusing on that depiction for giving a low score to the movie are already so narrow-minded that their score shouldn't be taken seriously."
"jdring2005","5","0","8","11 September 2005"," Great by means of storyline, acting was excellent, but confusing and the battle scenes were done too quickly.
","Like I said, this movie deserves nothing above an 8. The lowest it should receive is a 7, however, but that's beyond the point. This movie is not for those who like a lot of intense battle scenes; this one only had two, i think, and they were distantly spaced apart; also, you couldn't tell wtf was going on. Otherwise, the acting was great--and I really (me, especially) like how Angelina Jolie looked--even though it was beyond retardation as to how Angelina never aged a a day over twenty years. Lol. It's true, in appearances at least. Anyhow, I remain to suggest this movie. But expect ultimate confusion, dizzying and few battle scenes, but at the same time great acting, an especially-good shot of Rosario Dawson (and Colin Ferrel, for those girls out there), and some good twists. no spoilers here; go see the movie! (rent it, though, don't buy it). 8/10 and 3/5."
"siriusem","10","0","11","10 September 2005"," Perfection
","This is actually the first time i am writing a 'review' of a movie as i haven't found any movie worth of it as it has always been just a movie, but this time its different.. Being born in todays Macedonia, I've always thought it would be really great to see a modern remake of a movie about Alexander, and it has finally happened. I was not going to see it in the theater as i heard a lot of bad talk about it, how the story is badly connected too much CGI etc etc.. then my friend called me and invited me to the movies to see it with him as he had already seen it but wanted to see it one more time. To my comment that people on the net haven't said too much good stuff about it he just said 'people are stupid'. To which I thought it really may have something into it.. so i gave it a try. As the first 15 minutes passed by i was totally moved by its perfectly fluid introduction combined with the music of Vangelis which transcends this life and i don't think anyone would ever be a better suit for this movie's composer.. not to mention he is a Greek which gives an even better feel of 'tradition and culture' attached to the movie. At this point i said.. OK , maybe later on the movie goes terribly wrong.. but it didn't.. There are movies that entertain us, teach us some lessons , make us think and then there are those that touch the deepest parts of our souls. Being a highly spiritual person, this movie was an incredible spiritual journey through the eyes of the soul of Alexander. As Farrell stated in one interview, today's major popularity is so narrow minded that they boil down everything to sex, not to mention the arrogant prejudice that todays moral standards are the best that have ever been.<br/><br/>I can say that this movie has touched me more than any one before, it made two grand points.<br/><br/>1) That people who have high idealistic goals, visions and dreams of harmony and love in the world can and will succeeded even if many of them initially fail, they failures pave the way for the next that will come and continue their quest. 2) That todays majority of population is totally ignorant of these values and the best thing they can think of after seeing this movie is think if Alexander was gay and the totally stupid and sad arguments among current Greeks and Macedonians of whether Alexander was Greek or Macedonian and who was who etc etc.. totally disappointing the aspirations of their main hero and ancestor who strives till the end of his life for human unification , one nation and one race where people are valued by deeds not heritage.. it is a shame either of these people claim him to be their ancestor.<br/><br/>For once in all the movies i've seen (and i've seen lots of them in my 25 years of life), we don't just get to see the physical accomplishments and the outside look of a true hero, we get to live and feel his life through his soul, which is something of a great great value to someone like me valuing the most in life my soul experiences above all. We get a glimpse of how true deep passion for something feels, how life has so much meaning if we have that passion and so little if we don't , we also see on the downside how lonely one gets when one ascends higher and higher towards the top where only few are able to follow and how lonely and full of suffering the path of a true hero is, even though on the outside he is envied by the most. And the acting of Collin Farrell is so energetic and involved, one can feel he truly did get inside the mind frame of Alexander.. which i got confirmed after reading he went to visit the grave of Philip and cried over it..<br/><br/>This movie is so much into the future that it will take time for it to be recognized for its true meaning. This movie is not about the battles, they were all alike, he came and won , over and over again, one and the greatest battle is enough to make us see what was it like, and another to make us see how difficult it could get.. this movie is also not about the details of sex preference of Alexander, which makes them completely irrelevant if we were to judge them from ancient point of view, it is neither about the todays layout of how a certain movie should look like (plot, characters, logic etc etc).<br/><br/>This movie is about the spiritual journey of Alexander, the deeds that affected his soul and the people he shared his quest with. Its about the following of ones passion truly and honestly, its about a manifestation of most of the extremes a human can dream to achieve, he had it all on both of the polarities of light and darkness (honesty , friendship , loyalty , leading by example, extreme honor , mercy but also swift dealing with his enemies, brutality , unforgivingness, high temperament and anger).. everything a true king had to have for its time.<br/><br/>I am still finding it difficult to process the intense energetic journey i had during those short 3 hours of time and packed with (as the ads said) the greatest legend of them all , which really happened. It is so packed with energy and feelings that it makes it so much larger than life.<br/><br/>Alexander himself would be proud of it and the points it made.. even though as in his case, it would go misunderstood by the most of people for its true essence."
"nikonrob","8","0","10","10 September 2005"," Why all the negative comments
","As i sit and read all the remarks for this movie, and seeing both the theatre and directors cut, it seems that the American public can never be satisified with anything anymore.<br/><br/>Granted this is not the best movie of all time nor is it the worst. All the actors did a fine job and Oliver Stone did his best to interpret the story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were no video cameras or film camera back in ancient times, so we have to take the facts that we are given and interpret them as best we can. The movie does seem to focus on too many things to keep the common mans interest really peeked.<br/><br/>My minor in college was ancient history and while I am no expert by any means, I believe they did as well a job as Hollywood can do with the historical accuracies, yes there are a few things that are not as accurate as they can be; this is a movie produced my Hollywood, not a biography from the history channel.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie was done well with good acting and and scenes that can draw you in. As we know form history, Alexander was a very complicated man and that is very difficult to portray in just a movie."

","I've worked it out. It took me a while, but I've finally figured it out. This film isn't damned by so many people because it's good, bad or indifferent. People have a problem with it because it's an Oliver Stone movie, simple as that. Now, in a world where a pile of old tosh like 'Million Dollar Baby' - easily the laziest piece of film making of recent years - gets the praise that it does and bags a truckload of Oscars to boot yet a brave attempt to film an almost untellable story like the life of Alexander gets so pilloried...well, what does it say about cinema goers? Most prominent are complaints that it's too long - not so - and that it's boring. I ask you, how could you tell a story like this and it be boring? You couldn't!

","First of all, I want to make clear that I was amazed when I saw the movie. After reading the critics, I was under the impression that it was one of the weakest films of the year. Nonsense, if you ask me. Alexander is a very good reconstruction of the historical hero's life and the world he ruled. If you compare it with Troy, you can say that the historical accuracy is perfect. The makers of Troy made their own version of Homer's Iliad, however they kept some confrontations. Stone's Alexander has a very convincing beginning. From the first second, your following the movie with great interest. The end might not be as good as the beginning, it still towers way above my expectations. The movie is a gift for the eyes. The movie is filled with amazing and beautiful scenes. The music is less good. Sometimes the music is very good and able to support the images in a harmonious way. But very often, the music is bombastic, over the top. Stone is not afraid to show the reality. He does not hide Alexander's affection towards Hephaistion. However they do not have a sexual relation, it shocked the conservative USA. Some Greek lawyers even sued Stone for embarrassing their country. They should have listened better to Aristotel in the beginning. He explains when men are united by sexual lusts, it is perverse, but when their relation results in harmony and great deeds, it is positive. I enjoyed watching the film. You can easily say it is the best historical movie of the year. It is able to compete with the big ones like gladiator."
"citizenchris","8","0","8","29 August 2005"," a brief comment on a good movie
","Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" is a good movie in my opinion, easily the one of the best films of its kind. The film is beautiful on all fronts: Dialogue, Performances, Cinematography, and Vangelis' wonderful score. All these elements come together in a film that is as good if not better than Scot's ""Gladiator"" and Gibson's ""Braveheart"". I find it ironic that most moviegoers scoff at the ""professional"" newspaper/magazine critics. The reality is that these critics have a great deal of influence over the public's views of films. If the ""buzz"" is overwhelmingly negative are we open minded enough to view a film and form our own opinions? No. I ask you, how many times have the critics gotten it wrong? How many times have we looked back and said ""you know what, that was a good movie?"" Ultimately we are conformists reluctant to speak the truth...the Emperor is naked for gods sakes. <br/><br/>But that's just my opinion, what the hell do I know?<br/><br/>P.s. this review is of the ""Directors Cut"" of the film."
"Spacetree","8","0","7","29 August 2005"," I really don't have any complaints about this movie
","Well, that's not true. I thought that the battle scene (at least the first one) was unnecessarily stretched out. It's seemed overly majestic while lacking any real dynamics. Stuff just started happening, then it kind of ended. The second battle scene was much more organized and flowing, but in general it's not the epic battles you see this movie for. It's the nigh impeccable drama and acting. Nothing seemed to stale in the plot, and everything was near enthralling. Nothing nor anyone seemed superfluous. The actors fit the dynamics of the characters perfectly, and....<br/><br/>Well, almost perfectly. I'm not saying that Farrell didn't play the part well, in fact I think he played it very well. It's just that in some parts it seemed that he overacted the role. Now, this is my personal view only, but I expected a king that wasn't so... whiny. Sure, emotional scenes were done well, but in scenes that seemed to require more majesty, he seemed to start chewing scenery. First he ate a bush, then a tree, and for good show a spear or two. He was a strong lead, I just expected less from him sometimes.<br/><br/>Other that, great movie.<br/><br/>Oh, and anyone who makes a deal out of the ""homosexuality issue"" is a moron."
"pilgrim204","5","0","1","27 August 2005"," Enjoying so far
","Movie so far has been pretty good however my real need to leave a review a half hour into the movie, is the accents! Is Colin Farrells (spelling?) head so big that he insisted on not only him but his younger self having the accent? Or is he so lacking on talent that a poor American accent (SWAT) is all he can come up with? I'm a 'bitter Scotsman' (apparently) who continually watches Scots actors hide their accents in the name of keeping the movie linear.<br/><br/>This movie would have been better if everyone had the same accent. It is off putting as I watch a Greek with an Irish accent! Completely ruins Greek history along with the grossly inaccurate historical scenes."
"merereflection48","8","0","5","24 August 2005"," After consideration
","I must first say I have studied not only Alexander but many great military figures. Having said that, I will also say that history is a topic closely scrutinized. Alexander the man, was discussed at the Naval War College to a very high degree. So suffice it to say I know more than the film puts forth.<br/><br/>As an entertainment medium I saw the effort as extreme. I personally had to view the film several times before I truly felt the intent. Oliver Stone could have easily made a twelve hour film and still missed much. I am not a student of film. I am a former military officer and a student of history. I could criticize much but,the film moved me in such a way that it would be inane for me to do so.<br/><br/>I believe the lead role was beyond the actors' yield. I also believe he did the best he could, so I will not comment on who should have played the part of Alexander. I was satisfied with the end result.<br/><br/>I feel this film has received a bad review from the general public based in a large part on the sexual orientation of the historical figures. Well, I am sorry to say it is the way that it was, times were different and homosexuality was widely accepted and actually promoted through the ranks in the military. Not my opinion but fact.<br/><br/>I will watch this film for what it is, an extraordinary effort to relate historical fact."
"athena24","9","0","6","19 August 2005"," One of the best movies in times.
","This is certainly the most underestimated movie in all times.<br/><br/>First I saw the rating and thought that it's another history/mythology movie that is wasted ( like Troy ). But I read the reviews about it and decided I should see it, and thanks for that. Now I'm joining to those who are praising the movie.<br/><br/>My friends that saw the movie complained about over homosexual reference. In my opinion the movie sets everything in proportion. There is nothing explicit, no porno. It's just the director trying to make us see the real story about Alexander. What person he was, whom he loved, what did he tried to achieve? And I think he succeeded. When the movie was over I could tell that this is how it was for real.<br/><br/>The battle scenes, though short, are great. Specially the view of the battle field from an eye of an eagle. All the views were magnificent: the desert,the tropical Indian forest, snow mountains... The only movie that can be compared over the views with Alexander is Hero. The acting was superb. I can hardly see anyone else instead of Colin Farrel as Alexander. I can continue like this about everything the dialogs, costumes, score... I was paralyzed when I saw it.<br/><br/>This is definitely the best movie for Oliver Stone, and one of the best in all times. And for those who despised it just because of the homosexual reference, think that this is probably close to true story of Alexander. I'm sure none would like the battle with the Ellefant to be omitted."

","Wonderful thought-provoking large scale epic. I had very little knowledge of Alexander, I just watched the movie for pure enjoyment. I was not disappointed. I tell friends, just sit back, get a tray full of snacks, popcorn, and coffee and enjoy! The movie was about 65% battle scenes, campground discussion, battle preparation, and moving speeches to the troops. The rest of the movie gave background story, Angelie Jolie's behind-the-scenes encouragements, evil doings of the family, etc. The battle scenes were awesome, I have never seen anything like this in my life. You could see how the Greeks fought hand to hand with sometimes no more than a spear and a shield. Hardly anybody was on horseback except the leaders. It was rough and violent to the max. The soldiers were so brave and actually some of them were very old. It really makes you think about modern warfare when you see this type of fighting. It was different than Troy with Brad Pitt."

","This is an excellent historical movie. I thought it was well directed with excellent acting. The story was excellent and easy to follow. The narrative was well done and I liked the going back and forth in time to emphasize the character development of Alexander. The references to myths and legends was interesting and intelligent. The atmosphere was genuine and the interpretation of the story appears to have been well researched. The musical score was inspiring. This is a good film for the viewer who enjoys an intellectually stimulating story and character study. I would also recommend it to anyone who loves history and a good movie with historical background. Why did this movie did not do as well as expected in North America? Perhaps the fact that a number of movies about ancient times real or imagined were released around the same time resulted in a lack of interest. I'm glad I didn't miss the opportunity to see this movie."
"wkonrad","6","0","1","11 August 2005"," It was good, but I was hoping for a more in-depth historical account.
","Although I enjoyed this movie, I felt that too much attention was placed on the relationship between Alexander and his parents. Too many of the mythical, and historical events that made Alexander such a controversial subject in history were skipped. The first major battle against Darius (Battle of Issus) where Alexander proved that he was a brilliant tactician, was not even mentioned. There was no mention of Alexander's unorthodox solving of the Gordian Knot puzzle (supposedly anyone who could untie this massive tangle of knots would rule Asia; Alexander untied it by cutting it open with his sword). What about the capture/burning of the Persian capital of Persepolis, or the scaling of Aornos (a mountain in modern day Pakistan) to squash rebel resistance? I don't know if the issue was budget, or a rush to release the movie at a certain time, but I feel that a much better job of telling the tale of one of history's great military commanders could have been accomplished in about 4 hours. I failed to see the need of switching between present day and the past to show Alexander's mother preaching about treachery. This movie fails as did the version with Richard Burton in that it focuses too much on events in Macedonia, as opposed to Persia where Alexander accomplished his greatest feats.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the movie has a great cast. The battle scenes are entertaining, but fail to exploit Alexander's genius in battle. I recommend that people research the life/accomplishments of Alexander before watching the movie or they will fail to grasp how great his accomplishments were."

","I waited for the DVD to come out because of the overwhelmingly bad reviews - the reviews disappointed me so much that I just didn't want to think about the film. Of course, its always a mistake not to see a film on this scale in a theatre and I will never make that mistake again. I liked the film very much - loved the way that Stone mostly followed Lane's account, loved the presentation of Babylon but I did have the following problems: 1. Structure was a mess should have simply opened with Phillip's assassination. 2. Way too much Angelina Jolie. I didn't think that possible but man, that bad accent - didn't it seem like some kind of Russian, Boris and Natacha accent? 3. My biggest problem is that we never, ever get a real sense why Alexander was followed and is called Alexander the Great. Stone should have included his being made a god in Egypt and found a way to get in the idea that he might have even inspired Christianity. The couple of speeches in front of the troops seemed like bad ripoffs of Shakespeare or Braveheart. Stone gives us the guy in the flesh but we should have gotten some idea of the guys incredible personal appeal."
"skyscraper265","10","0","9","10 August 2005"," Excellent movie
","I just saw the movie and thought that it was great. Stone could've done without the insisting on Alexanders alleged homosexuality but then again I'm not one to judge. As a Greek and as a school teacher I have to say that the movie for the most part is historically accurate and portrays the man not as a bloodthirsty conqueror but as a man with a dream. Western civilization would not be what it is without him today. I've also read a few posts by people calling themselves ""Macedonians"". The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a Slavic country to the North of Greece. They are in no way related to ancient Greek Macedonians as they are Slavs who came to the Balkans in the 7th century A.D whilst Alexander lived a thousand years before that. They now call themselves Macedonians for political reasons, mainly to maintain the unity of their country, composed of Slavs and a 30% minority of Albanians. Alexander was Greek. All inscriptions found in Macedonia from that time were Greek and the Greek language was transmitted throughout his empire. That' why the gospels were originally written in Greek."
"north-julie","7","0","1","9 August 2005"," a good addition to the growing list of historical epics
","I followed the story of Alexander from production to completion. During filming, the general feeling was that it was going to be average at best. Despite the legendary director, strong cast and huge budget, cynics claimed Aleaxander would flop<br/><br/>Alexander flopped in America, and Britain. It did however make a slight profit on its 150million dollar budget worldwide, so it can be said that all was not lost. Except some of the respect people had for Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>I recently bought the Directors Cut of Alexander. I'd read the scathing reviews, and seen its disappointing grosses. I have to admit I've never seen any other Oliver Stone movie, so my judgement of this film might be at pains to other people who've seen his past films. I have to say i enjoyed this movie, despite the big flaws.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Farrell, Jolie and Kilmer. Any criticisms of their performances is unfair. Farrell, playing the King who conquered the planet, does what he can with the material available. Remember Alexander lived years ago, so it can never be completely defined what made him charge across the globe. Farrell displays all of the necessary emotions and character nuances to help us decide why Alexander did what he did. Alexander is presented as a king who sometimes begged his troops in desperation to fight for him, as a strong willed leader who took an army of 40,000 to victory against an army of 250,000, and as a cultured man who tried and failed to unite different nationalities and cultures together. Remember that this film covers his ENTIRE LIFE, so his reasons and beliefs might have changed as the years passed.<br/><br/>Questions were asked as to why Alexander begged his troops to fight in India. Well, would you want to fight another battle after doing so for eight years? Alexander knew his men were tired and scared so he begged. His willingness to lower himself from King to the equal of these men took a lot of courage. People ask armies fought and died for a man who weeped and begged them to. The answer is so blindingly obvious its surprising nobody has brought it up before. HE WAS KING! He was their ruler, so they had to fight for him regardless of whether he inspired them. If they didn't fight, they were executed (like the doctor at the end of the film). <br/><br/>Jolie is bizarre draped in snakes and speaking in a weird accent. Why? Remember, they were nuts in those days, so a woman like her was nothing new. What's clear from history and legends is that the ancient times were FULL of strange characters like Olympius. What about Hercules, the man who could pick up a house? Achilles, the man who killed hundreds whilst never getting injured (at least according to Troy). Why couldn't a woman be covered in snakes? As Olympius, Jolie has fun being as weird and wonderful as like in real life.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer is great as the drunken lout of a King who was(or wasn't in Olympius's eyes) the father of Alexander. People criticise him saying he was one dimensional. Well, how many dimensions does an alcoholic have? He was fine as Phillip, playing him well. The scene in which he banishes Alexander from his court is extremely well played by Kilmer (and Farrell).<br/><br/>The battle scenes are the most visceral and astounding ever put to film. The first, at guagmela, is the best I've ever seen beating anything in Troy because it just seems more real. Whereas the two armies stood battering each other without any skill or tactics in Troy, the essence of Guagmela is the skill of Alexander while leading his incredibly outnumbered army to victory. The blood flows, unlike in Troy and the abysmal KIng Arthur, and the furious devastating blows exchanged give this battle something that these other epics lacked. Guagmela is hard to follow at first, but when watched again, it's clear how the battle unfolds. Alexander charges his cavalry down the right flank, waiting for King Darius to advance the front of his army towards the Macedonion phalanxes. Alexander, with the order ""LEFT TURN!"" charges into the 'bridge' (gap between the Persian front and back lines) assaulting the troops directly in front of Darius himself. A spectacular engagement just like the battle in India which features stampeding elephants and even more carnage. It also features the glorious sequence in which the injured Alexander is carried away from his final victory, with Vangelis magnificent score playing in the background.<br/><br/>Flaws- the battles can be confusing. Anthony Hopkins is annoying as Ptolmey. Jared Leto is wasted as Hepthastion. His homosexual scenes with Alexander are underplayed. Leto wears eyeliner. Rosario Dawson is wasted, although her sex scene with Alexander is surprisingly graphic. And yes, some of the dialogue is literally written monologue. It needed another battle in the middle of the film, instead of one at the beginning and end.<br/><br/>But the score from Vangelis, astounding battle scenes, superb individual sequences such as Alexander taming his horse, being carried off the battlefield in India, and superb end credits mean that this is a missed opportunity yes, but not the complete failure it has been called.<br/><br/>One more thing. The bisexuality of Alexander is dealt with maturely, but repeatedly. Why the problem with this? Homosexuality isn't outlawed. Its not like Farrell has sex with Leto. If you're going to make a film based on someones life, make sure you don't lose too many details. Alexander and Hepthiastion are soulmates and in the directors cut at least, this is shown. Nothing graphic, just love they could never reveal to the world.<br/><br/>There is more to say about Alexander but I've said enough. The directors cut is enjoyable, don't be put off by bad reviews and negative press. this is a good film!"
"pninson","6","0","1","8 August 2005"," Reasonably entertaining
","Some of the harsh reviews of this movie may be due to high expectations. Oliver Stone clearly put a lot of effort into this movie; this shows primarily in the production design, set decoration, and photography. This is one great-looking film.<br/><br/>Of course there are plenty of great-looking films that are dull and tedious, or simply fall short of a genuinely absorbing story. Alexander is balanced perilously on the edge between a stiff, uninvolved plot and a rousing epic. There's some of both.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell doesn't seem the right choice for a dynamic leader of men. I can't criticize his performance so much as the script, which calls for him to either scream, cry, or speechify in almost every scene. He isn't awful; but he doesn't project the charisma you'd expect from a leader of a vast army. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie's performance has been much criticized, but I found her one of the more appealing things about the film. The bit with the snakes is strange, but her character is three-dimensional; in fact her screen presence is somewhat stronger than Farrell's.<br/><br/>Scene after scene goes on forever, with the actors chewing scenery like there's no tomorrow as swelling music hammers the point home. Fortunately, there's lots of gorgeous scenery to chew, especially if you watch this film in high-def. <br/><br/>The movie gets off to a slow start, but picks up in the second hour and becomes genuinely engrossing thereafter. I might have found it hard to sit through all three hours in a theater, but for home viewing it's decent entertainment.<br/><br/>It's certainly no worse than ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"", two wildly over-praised films which I *did* sit through in a theater. As an older man, I'm perhaps too influenced by memories of the old-fashioned epics like ""Spartacus"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire."" These older films have their flaws also --- cheesy dialogue and some wooden performances --- but there's great pulp fiction storytelling, and that's what makes them so entertaining. ""Troy"" and ""Gladiator"" are a bit too pretentious for my taste, and while ""Alexander"" certainly suffers from the same problems, it's at least as enjoyable.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is a much better film than the early 50s ""Alexander the Great"", starring Richard Burton as Alexander. I sat through the DVD of that movie last fall and it's ultra-boring. Dull from start to finish. Oliver Stone's picture falls far short of the mark, but at least it's entertaining."

Again a masterpiece of a director who knows what movies are mend to be. This 3 hours movie felt as if its duration was about an hour. The fact that most negative reviews refer to the character of Alexander proves that the actor did a great job in playing a narcissistic traumatized stiff-head with great mental power and vision. Kept me thinking for several days and I'm still asking myself why the movie does not gets the credits it deserves.

","""Alexander"" is a triumph in film-making on several levels. It is visually stunning, beautifully scored, and wonderfully paced. The movie opens with a prologue by Ptolemy, the first pharaoh to rule following the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great. Ptolemy was one of Alexander's closest friends. <br/><br/>We are then introduced to Olympias, Alexander's foreign-born mother, whose fierce ambition for her son is driven by her belief that the Greek god Zeus, rather than her husband King Phillip, is the father of Alexander. She teaches her son courage at an early age, encouraging him to touch a poisonous snake without hesitation.<br/><br/>From the first time we meet him, it is clear that Alexander is indeed courageous, as well as a sensitive and scholarly young man, who questions his great teacher Aristotle about everything. His is both resented and admired by his father, a drunken and lecherous man. Nevertheless, Alexander proves himself early in life to his father by taming a seemingly wild horse, who along with his best friend, Hephaistion, becomes his greatest love. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone's portrayal is honest, showing those aspects of Alexander that are more controversial, such as Alexander's bisexuality, and mental decline after the death of Hephaistion.<br/><br/>At the same time, we see a man who embraced diversity, respected women, and had a vision for a united world that modern audiences can appreciate. A brilliant military strategist who tempered his drive for power and conquest with a profound ability to love. All in all, a well rounded portrait of Alexander emerges. <br/><br/>The musical score is haunting, and the closing credits are some of the best that I have seen. The costumes are spectacular, the scenery breathtaking. Furthermore, the movie has an authentic old-world feel in spite of its Hollywood cast, making it closer to ""The Passion of the Christ"" than a big Hollywood production like ""Troy."" Indeed, listening to Stone' commentary on his film, you appreciate how hard he worked on it, and it shows.<br/><br/>""Alexander"" is a stirring timeless epic that leaves one moved and inspired."

","Stone's ""Alexander"" tries to tell the story of one of the great military leaders and conquerors of all time who is to this day, some 2300 years later, is still studied in military war colleges. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to do too much resulting in three hours of jumping around in time trying desperately to show us the man and his human story while carrying on great expeditionary campaigns at the same time. With insufficient didactics, overzealous theatrics, and the esoterics of the time, the film becomes nothing less than a numbing mess. Listening to Stone's director's cut one gets the impression he had a clear vision of what he wanted to accomplish with his well researched historical epic. One also gets the impression he made the movie for himself. Lacking in coherence, muddled and messy, ""Alexander"" is a classic example of what happens when one ventures too deep into that creative territory where less is more resulting in a spectacular flop.

","I watched the theatrical version of this film on DVD last night as I was very curious about all the kerfuffle. As it turns out, even though I am heavily prejudiced against Oliver Stone for the sheer mass of lies contained in his delirious ode to irresponsible homophobia called ""JFK"", and for hanging out with and glorifying small-time and big-time real-life homophobic tyrants like Jim Garrison and Fidel Castro, I must say his film of ""Alexander"" got most everything right. What nobody will tell you, of course, is that this ""Alexander"" is an almost scene-for-scene transposition of Mary Renault's novel ""The Persian Boy"" (Alexander's conquests as seen from the eyes of his favourite eunuch, Bagoas). The only thing that's changed is having Ptolemy act as the narrator instead of Bagoas (both dictating in Alexandria many years later). This, shall we say, ""borrowing"" of course explains why the film is so gay-positive, which, I suppose, is Mr. Stone's way of atoning for past sins. As luck would have it, Middle America was not ready for such frankness and Mr. Stone now knows what it is to be bad-mouthed for having ""gay sympathies"", by which he will probably learn a lesson. Or then again, maybe not, judging from the self-censorship job he pulled on his own ""director's cut"" from which every naughty bit was excised. But this does not distract from the fact that ""Alexander"" (the theatrical version) is a rather competent film that was obviously misunderstood by a whole bunch of Yahoos and Joe Six-Packs (Stone's regular public) who were lured into theatres to stare at Ms. Jolie's gazongas. And that is very sad for the future of film-making in America."

","Let's go straight to the point: ""Alexander"" is an uneven epic, but is not that bad as Oliver Stone's haters insist on claiming.<br/><br/>PROS: Oliver Stone made the film he wanted, his personal view on Alexander. He wasn't afraid on including homoerotic scenes, and didn't make lots of battle scenes to entrance a larger audience. For these reasons, I found ""Alexander"" much more interesting than the fairly entertaining, but mythologically shallow ""Troy"", for instance.<br/><br/>CONS: The performances are disappointing: I expected more from Colin Farrell as Alexander; he is not bad, but leaves more to be desired, as well as Val Kilmer (Philip). Angelina Jolie sucks as Olympias (her accent, anyone?), and Rosario Dawson (Roxane) is not much better; Jared Leto (Hephaistion) is just 'OK'. Anthony Hopkins (Old Ptolemy), is the best (which comes as no surprise), but he isn't on show for too long. Some scenes are over the top or excessively flamboyant; some dialogues are quite poor. Vangelis' score is inopportune; Gabriel Yared, Hans Zimmer or Howard Shore would have been better, I guess.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a film to be seen for what it is, not for what it could have been.<br/><br/>My vote: 6.5 out of 10."

His father(Phillip) teaches him that there is no glory without suffering, and that greatness comes from loss.<br/><br/>He would go on to conquer Asia, Southeast Egypt and be declared the ""true son"" of Zeus.<br/><br/>The battle sequences in the film had a wide area of weapons and the above shots gave an overhead scope of the battle.

The climactic battle in India with horse backed warriors against soldiers from India on mounted Elephants was epic. Stone using red film stock switches to emphasize his vision of battle. With some premonition, Alexander sees his death in the reflection( of Medusa) of the wine he's about to drink. During this time, men abandon him, as he sought conspirators within his camp. Great performances by Colin Ferrell, Jared Leto, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins and Angelina Jolie, who displayed impressive range as an actress(by playing a woman older than she really is).<br/><br/>Oliver Stone delivered a condensed, impassioned film about The Greatest Alexander of all."

","Alexander is portrayed as heavily homosexual in this movie, somewhat tainting the image of him as a great warrior. Many thematic elements evidence a flamboyance that detracts from the general mood, generating facades that don't match. Such as the helmet that showed a closer resemblance to a head dress than a piece of armor, and music that was more fitting for a frolic in the flowers, than for a conqueror marching victorious. The bizarre twist of feminine beauty that is attributed to such a bloody and ugly thing as war, bloodshed, and dismemberment makes the movie seem heterogeneous, and many parts from the musical score and costumes to the camera work seem out of place. I have never encountered the perception of Alexander as gay in any of my experiences with Greek history, and for such an opinion to erect itself so suddenly leads me to question its historical accuracy."

Finally with follow Alexander on his great conquest to the east, beginning with the conquest of Babylon and finally the battle in the deep forests in India. The focus is spent mostly on Alexander as a person and his visions and relationships with his mother, wife and generals (and especially Hephaistion).<br/><br/>Comment: This is a truly epic movie. It is very well done with concern for details. Colours and scenes are very beautiful and breathtaking and battle scenes massive. It is spearheaded by director Stone and a very competent cast including Farell, Kilmer, Jolie and Hopkins. However, even if Alexander is mainly busy with war and conquest the tempo of the movie is slow and the action-paced battle scenes are far between. It is an interesting story that is told, but the movie is simply a little too long. It almost grows dull, even if I believe it is rather historically accurate. Another problem I personally had is Farell as Alexander. Farell is a very competent actor, but with his hair dyed blonde he just didn't seem credible as Alexander. It seemed out of place. In conclusion, an average movie with very nice cinematic aspects.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I have always been a great admirer of Alexander, a man of great talent, fortitude and charisma. I have read countless books on the man and feel that if you look at his life as a whole this film covers about 5% of his life. Whilst most people feel that his relationship with Hephaistion was not covered fully, I feel that it concentrated too much on this relationship along with his relationship with his mother. Agreed this is what made him the man he was but this could have been covered in about 20 minutes of the film. The man lead a nation to greatness and all we can talk about was his sexual preferences, WHO CARES!!! homosexuality is a 19th - 20th century word, back then it just was.<br/><br/>Anyway I digress where was the talk of the relationship with his generals? They cavort as though old friends, I know why but the film does not show the length to which his generals / friends went to to stay together during his exile a point which so easily could have been added thus showing the esteem and loyalty he gained from his men. At one point in his life it seemed there was nothing he couldn't achieve, I felt nothing of this from the film.<br/><br/>I felt like I waited forever for this film and felt cheated.

The drama is kind of corny and the movie does get boring, but the action will have you at the edge of your seat. The movie starts out at young Alexander's home and then goes on to him riding horses, getting education, and all that. Then it goes to a battle scene with Persians and Alexanders army. This is a great and thrilling battle with charriots cutting legs off, pikes going through bodies, and all that gory stuff. The battle is excellently filmed and the stabs and slashes and people flying everywhere are very realistic. The rest of the middle of the movie is journeys, executions, and love scenes with Alexander and his Persian wife. Then it goes to another battle scene with war elephants in the jungle. To me this battle is one of the best i've ever seen, with elephants smashing bodies and Indians beating people with hammers. Then Alexander goes one on one with an elephant, until the man on it throws a spear at Alexander. The rest of the movie is about the army going home and Alexander dying. If only the movie had more battles it would of been better. But then again, it's a three and a half hour long movie with only two battles, so don't expect a Troy out of this movie. I give it seven stars."

However when I finally I did get myself to sit through it, the end result was a very pleasant evening. It is true that the film is a bit weird... like when you get important bits (like Philip's murder, Alexander's ascension to the Macedonian throne and his victory over the Persian king) being left out and then maybe explained later on... it is confusing. And then it was quite long I must say... one does tend to get the attitude ""Come on Alex, hurry up and die so we can go and have a beer""... The ending was a bit confusing... it is not clear whether Alexander was poisoned or whether he died of some disease... BUT considering the sheer grandeur that is found everywhere in this movie, I must admit that it is great.<br/><br/>The character I liked most was Olympias'.. and Angelina does a fine job at it. She is like some kind of sorceress always looming in the shadows... it's true that she doesn't get to do much in the whole movie, but the little bits she has here and there are acted out perfectly. She truly has the shape and looks of a Macedonian dowager queen.<br/><br/>A friend of mine had told me that Colin Farell had no stamina to be the lead of such an epic movie... well I have my reservations on that comment. Truly he was no Charlton Heston in ""Ben Hur"", but still he fit the part of a conquering-obsessed leader very well.<br/><br/>Even the others who were his companions all throughout his journeys from Macedonia all the way to India and back to Babylon were great, creating a balance between the friends who want to support their king and husbands who want to go back to their families and their fatherland.

Therefore, i would have to say this movie is really pretty bad. There were many scenes that went on for too long after making a point, and also at the same time some parts were very brief.

The acting, the script, in fact, the rest of the movie, however, were appalling. 'Alexander' was more like a panto version of 'Braveheart' or 'Henry V' than anything real. There were awkward snippets of action, especially anything involving Alexander and his troops, that appear to have been stolen from 'Braveheart', Shakespeare's 'Henry V', and even 'Gone With the Wind'. One guesses that Oliver Stone might have imagined a much grander, more noble, and truly stirring combination of these elements. As it turned out, unfortunately for us in the audience, nothing fit.<br/><br/>His international cast also seemed to be speaking in a variety of accents--- no one accent was selected by the director for the characters to use. The majority of the cast was British, so English and Scottish accents prevailed, but there were others.

The film to me was of a good standard.<br/><br/>Jolie puts in an really good performance as Alexander's scheming mother as does Farrell for the hero himself, Of course Farrell did receive criticism for his Irish accent but I ask those certain people to remember that it is only a movie, At that time I don't think they would have spoken English anyway! Another factor to point out was the battle scenes, which may I say were done brilliantly even though there are only two major scenes throughout the whole film. As with every film it does have it's problems, In this I'm afraid it's Anthony Hopkins and Val Kilmer who do tend to ramble on a bit when it comes to them.<br/><br/>Overall, Alexander is a definitely a film for those of a more mature nature who don't mind sitting through a lot of dialogue before getting to the action but if you are one of those who get bored easily Alexander is totally not the film for you.<br/><br/>*** Good"

I can't understand why this movie hasn't a great success in America! There, a lot of people love it...maybe our culture is too different from the American one. Maybe this is the question.<br/><br/>I like very much how Colin Farrell played Alexander... a great actor for a great king ;) <br/><br/>Nilde_87"
"a-grimm","9","0","10","19 January 2005"," Fairly historically accurate, if a bit long
","Of course, I think the controversy of this movie is that Alexander was probably more into guys than girl. If you've ever read a biography written of Alexander in the last fifty years, it was pretty obvious, even when they took pains not to say it. Culturally, since the ancient Greeks were fairly more open about 'alternate lifestyles' than we are in the US, it all seems to fit. Sadly, as Americans, we don't seem to be grown up enough to get past the idea that one of the greatest leaders in history was a big 'mo.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, I found it to be a bit long, even though I could tell that they'd compressed a WHOLE lot of history into roughly a three-hour block. Considering what they covered, I thought the story line was not only accurate, but appropriate. If you question the accuracy, the History Channel just aired a documentary that was careful NOT to discuss Alexander's sexuality, but seemed to follow along the story of the movie. I thought that some of the actors were a little... over done, particularly Angelina Jolie, but the accent was sexy as all get out. I also thought the supporting cast had some weak links, but overall I thought it was one of the best of the epic dramas that we've been seeing in the last few years."
"sjwest","7","0","5","19 January 2005"," A Biopic Of Noteworthy Achievement.
","One of history's' most notable figures once again graces the grand cinema stage. With a massive budget, an accomplished director and a newsworthy ensemble cast, one would expect a positive opening. This was, however, not the case. In fact, critics have slated it and many viewers have vociferously voiced objections. Despite the negative attention, as a fan of Oliver Stone's, I found it difficult not to enjoy. Against this background I will discuss the salient points.<br/><br/>Alexander's sexuality is a core issue. The inclusion here is for me to bring forth a real impression of what Alexander was like. Indeed as Alexander creates the empire in his vision, he begins to experience dissent within the ranks, his sexual tendencies lean more towards men. At one point of his life, not included in the movie, Alexander considers suicide when Hephaistion dies and therefore some of Alexander's behavior is a consequence of what he was.<br/><br/>Stone has signed himself some artistic license with the portrayal of Alexander's mother. Angelina Jolie takes to the task admirably. She uses a Romanian vampire  like voice while adorning herself with snakes - a consequence of her religious tendencies. Her voice is what distinguishes the character and I am sure that Stone liked the look of Angelina's prominent lips, attractive - mind you, as it accentuated the image of a serpent. This portrayal displays a manipulative woman with intent against her husband, Prince Philip. Jolie gives us an entertaining insight into the motivations of the mother. We see her impact on Alexander.<br/><br/>The flashback to the death of his father is done to illustrate how the event affected him. Story flow is crucial but given the length of the movie and the fact that we were given further insight into the character of Alexander, it was the appropriate thing to do. This as an influential factor on Alexander's drive and ambition was critical and well highlighted.<br/><br/>The high points of the movie were the battle scenes and here again we see the strategic use of Alexander's extensive history of battles. The first one at Gaugamela is indicative of the height of Alexander's leadership. He takes on an apparently insurmountable force and displays single mindedness to kill Darius in the field. His tactics proved correct as Darius fled. He was the heart of the Persian army  without him they ceased to function as a cohesive unit and thus folded.<br/><br/>The camera work is panoramic and emphasizes the tactical battle by displaying the opposing forces with their deliberate placement and order. The close  ups display the ferociousness of the encounter and the brutality of war in those times is clearly depicted. It also helped to indicate the glory of this great time in Alexander's life. The soaring eagle as a metaphor for Alexander's greatness was at no time more relevant than at this battle.<br/><br/>The final battle at the Hydapses River showed his deep  set belief that he was the son of Zeus. When the lines started to retreat, he charged forward and crashed into selfless attack thus motivating his forces to follow. The next scene was a defining one for Alexander. He turns to charge an elephant, undaunted, driven by rage and self  belief. His equally brave horse, Bucephalus, rears up to face the enemy and the two are momentarily frozen in time facing each other like bitter enemies. The image represents Alexander's drive and ambition and his unwavering bravery against foes far greater in size and number. It is the most endearing one of the movie. The image of Alexander in the minds eye of Stone.<br/><br/>A justifiable point is that the accents did nothing to serve the biopic. I do understand that Stone was trying to illustrate the cosmopolitan nature of dialects, but the obvious European accents only served to distract the audience from the story and yanked us from what was a seamless story flow. I did get used to it, but the impression did linger long after leaving the cinema. Although it was not enough to ruin my enjoyment, it is a detractor and the attempt did not follow through.<br/><br/>What interested me after seeing the movie was to access if Stone was still delivering after being many successful years in the industry. The best comparison for me was to compare two scenes which depicted the soul of the movie. The first is the eternal image of a soldier in 'Platoon', arms open to the heavens crying for the loss of innocence and tragedy of the Vietnam War. This while listening to the melancholic soundtrack forever etched on movie history. It was an enigmatic image, simple in design, masterful in delivery.<br/><br/>Already touched on is the confrontation with the elephant. Although the scene itself has the same effect, the lead  up to this scene showed camera effects by the way of red tint and is followed by Alexander being carried away on his shield in grandiose fashion. It is this added complexity that Stone has added to his work that seems to be an influence from 90's Tarantino work that makes me favor the scene from 'Platoon'. It seemed more pure and unadulterated. The point here is that although the unique craftsmanship of Stone's is still strongly evident, it seems to have taken a new direction by way Tarantino.<br/><br/>Knowledge for the sake of knowledge is an exercise in futility. A dictation of history serves a lesser purpose and it does not move man forward. Greater understanding of great figures in history can only enrich us. This fact as well as the fact that the life of Alexander could not be adequately displayed given the time constraints that the big screen has, shows that Stone chose the correct analytical path to portray a character that has obviously occupied his mind for most of his life. In an era of remakes and sequels, it is most welcome."

","Alexander is not documentary, but is a film so it was an interpretation created by his director who choose some part of Alexander's history, the trouble of managing the power of an unimaginable empire and what were the meaning and the feeling of new conquests and discoveries 2000 years ago, and throw this mains themes there was a message that it compares Alexander to the other legends of that archaic world, and at the end we can say that maybe archaic history it was only an interpretation and an opinion of historians ideas. Maybe at the beginning we can think that the film left the beautifuler part of Alexander's formation and conquest of the power, we can have the feeling that the beginning of the film is discontinuous, but this is alone the result of the selection of the director that its fulfillment is concentrated on the more difficult part of the history. the way in which the Macedonians came to contact with new life shapes and new civilizations is incredible and Oliver Stone succeeds to decrease the same spectator in the wonder of the discoveries. i think that Troy in its it confronts is like a comic strip in the comparisons of a novel. thx"

"pete-446","6","0","1","15 January 2005"," Too camp for comfort
","When I first saw this movie advertised, I was quite excited. It has a terrific cast, a great director and who could ask for a better story? <br/><br/>Emerging from the cinema, I must confess this movie has some fantastic moments but I am I left a little disappointed.<br/><br/>I was utterly convinced by Kilmer and Jolie's performances as Alexander's parents. I've come to expect this quality from Kilmer, but Jolie was a real unexpected treat. I see from other posts that she's getting some abuse over the dodgy accent, but I felt that it was quite appropriate given the historic origins of Olympias. These two were really great and its a real pity we don't get to see more of them. The role of King Philip in particular is quite understated in the movie.<br/><br/>Another positive aspect is the attention to historical detail in this movie. This goes as far as using historical quotes in the dialogue. An example of this is when Alexander and Philip fight at Phlip's wedding to Cleopatra. I'm no expert on the history of Alexander, but there didn't seem to be any real historical howlers that spoilt my enjoyment.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the movie was the scene where Alexander charges an Elephant in battle. This is beautifully crafted and also serves as the perfect metaphor of Alexander's life. A lone man on a horse from the west, charging down the giant of Asia with only his ambition and courage to support him. Like many such scenes in the movie, it feels real and not ruined by stodgy CG effects.<br/><br/>So why was I disappointed when there were all these great things going on? There were actually a few causes for my discontent.<br/><br/>Lets begin by getting on to the controversial subject of Alexander's sexuality. I was a little baffled by how this was handled in the film and the cynical side of me might even argue that it was done to generate publicity.<br/><br/>Of course historically, Alexander's preferences have a lot of ambiguity, which was not at all uncommon for his period of history. Farrell actually does a pretty good at maintaining this ambiguity, but his efforts are spoilt by the final cut of the movie.<br/><br/>In the movie we are treated to a constant bombardment of homo-erotic undertones. The worst of which comes in the form of a super-camp Hephaistion. Hephaistion appears as a weepy-eyed softy that seems to spend his life mooning over his love for Alexander. For me, this doesn't correspond to Hephaistion, dearest friend and general who commanded Alexander's fleet and was actually physically larger than Alexander. In fact many of the male characters were inflicted with very distracting eye makeup that made them look like they were in drag; not good when we are expected to believe that they are capable of dismembering people on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Whilst the real Alexander had three wives we are given the distinct impression that he has absolutely no interest in women whatsoever. The only scenes where Alexander is intimate with a female come across as brutal and forced. I was left with the overwhelming impression that Alexander was very much gay (in the modern sense).<br/><br/>This whole theme seemed contrived, anachronistic and extremely overstated. It would have been equally inappropriate if Alexander had been repeatedly presented as strictly heterosexual. These labels had no real meaning in his world.<br/><br/>Regardless of his real preferences, historically it seems that Alexander was a man who believed in purity and self-restraint. From all accounts it seems he was not a very sexual person at all. Given the great events of his life, it would have been more appropriate to have only given a cursory nod to his sexual life and then spent more time on the things that made him Alexander.<br/><br/>There just seemed to be big important chunks of Alexander's life missing from the movie. In its place there were a lot of scenes that seemed to drag on, but didn't add much to the story. For example, the prolonged battle scene in the desert was like watching a dust storm for 10 minutes and told us little of the military genius of our man.<br/><br/>Lastly I felt that there was some bad casting. The worst was Farrell himself. Although he still puts in an excellent performance, he just didn't seem like a natural fit.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if it hadn't been for all the eye makeup."

I suspect that Oliver Stone's head had engaged more gay problem rather than historical actions. For my opinion director was affected by Mel Gibson's ""Brave Hart"". Especially in dying scene and when Alexander was riding. What was Andgelina Golie doing in this film i can't understand. She performed like Alexander's mother but she looked like his wife. In every time when they were approaching i was thinking that now they are going to kiss. And eventually they did that. Enough critic now time complements.

"silfrenwulf","Null","0","1","13 January 2005"," What I felt personally about the film.
","I saw this film yesterday with my daughter and the feeling we both had was that for those unfamiliar with the history of Alexander the Great this film could prove to be a little confusing. I had no problem with the relationship portrayals in the film. People forget that this was set in a pre-Christian era in which sexual mores were different, plus if they were to read the ancient accounts it was acknowledged practise for a Greek warrior to take a male lover (e.g. study the history of the Spartans, amazingly tough warriors). I do feel though that more should have been shown with regard to Alexander's campaign and less on the relationships he had, as what he had achieved was incredible. Unfortunately my daughter, who is not a student of ancient history, found it difficult to follow elements of the film as they didn't seem to tie in or make sense to her, and we didn't like some aspects of the filming e.g. the excessive 'camera shake' during some of the scenes was frustrating. The soundtrack drowned out essential parts of the dialogue which didn't help at all but I don't know if that was the fault of the theatre where we saw the film or was intentional by the film makers. Other than that it was a good film."

I would like to ask you was it everything you could talk about Alexander and his time? was that all by what happened in the battle with Persians? why do did you try to satisfy what the public opinion was about the comparison of West and East? Makedonian and Persian Empires? Why did you forget that it's written in the history that Persian had the first and the most structured, symmetric, organized and magnific army? was it really like the reality in your historically supposed movie? I'm sure you know that Persian were not dressing Arabic costume, but why was it like that in your movie? Dear Mr. Oliver ! I'm sure there was much more to say about Alexander and his life story than insisting on the idea that he was a homosexual. how many shots did you spend to clarify that he was a gay? yes ! we understood your point by the first scene and it could be enough! you could explain much more serious things. or maybe this was more serious since the Hollywood commerciality must be considered. Couldn't explain more accurate about the most important battle of the movie. Makedonian and Persian!? Alexander won the battle, when a Persian queen betrayed the Persians and fired the most glamorous palace of the time; Pasargad. don't you think it was more fascinating to show these stuff, instead of making wrong impression that after the battle Alexander conquered Babylion. No Man! he conquered Pasargad and the battle happened close to that Place. He also visited the tomb of the first Persian King, One of the first and greatest kings of the world, Korous! he wanted to fire the tomb, but as he entered the room and read the memorial stone of the tomb as this: ""I'm Korous! The king of the Persian empire! whoever you are, you are welcomed to my land. respect this land and it's people as I respected your land and your people! Daer Mr. Oliver!

","Alexander is, without doubt, a breathtaking movie. The scenes depicting the battle of Gaugamela can be used in any presentation dealing with warfare in classical times. But somehow, the script starts losing itself after the triumphal entry of Alexander in Babylon. No doubt there will be viewers who'll disagree with me. But in the course of the movie, the central figure Alexander loses more and more depth, while the surrounding ones, including his wife Roxana, gain it. It could well be that Stone tried to convey to us the feeling of loss of direction overwhelming the Macedonians, but to me it felt particularly unsettling. At one point, I even grew tired of the many homosexual escapades of Alexander, wondering what essential elements that number actually did add to the storyline. I have to say that it did not.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because after seeing so many spectacle war movies with special effects, like Gladiator, Pearl Harbour and King Arthur, I am wondering whether I am supposed to look at the horrors and butchery of those times, or to learn more from the central figures. I long for the drama and the depth of older productions of the same kind and could even stand a bit of old-fashioned morale embroidered in the story. Enough of that crude hyperrealism embellished by smart special effects. Please have mercy and give us normal movies again!"

","From the moment I heard the bizarre mix of Irish Macedonian boys to the Russian enchantress of Ms Jolie, I just felt embarrassed for this film. Non of the serious bits of dialogue (which in content themselves don't' score above average) could be taken seriously, not only because I was laughing at the voices but at Colin's 80's Dj hairstyle and the complete wimpy girly ""hardmen"" hanging around with him. It's hard to imagine an army of thousands of Persians running from a guy who's hair looks like He-Man's or any of his skinny mates in skirts and eye-liner.<br/><br/>The whole gay-thing of Alexander, while maybe historically accurate, is more in the forefront of this movie than an actual plot. Why go conquering? What compelled Alexander to drive into the unknowns of India? The film just tries to cram in to much while one theme which would give it more of a plot.<br/><br/>For plot and acting (apart from Farrell and maybe Jolie) the film scores a cringe-worthy 3-4. However THERE IS A DIAMOND IN THIS ROUGH! THe movie looks amazing. The costumes, the sets but most especially the battles are on a scale that makes TRoy look as dated as Hammer Horror movies. The battles are something else with dust, dirt and blood making them claustraphobically real. The city of Babylon also lights up the screen. For me the battle in India is one of the best I've seen (apart from the mental red tree bit at the end!?) and Alexander's horse dying created the only moment of emotion in the film. Therefore, despite a less than average plot and poor casting outside the leading man, the battles and sets raise the score of this to a fair 6/10."

","Hello all,<br/><br/>Well I quite enjoyed Alexander. I can't believe everyone got so upset about the homosexuality, for a start very little is actually shown in the film, secondly, as Oliver Stone did so much historical research with Oxford professor Robin Lane Fox, doesn't it seem likely that he's got this part of the story accurate??? It's well known that the ancient greeks were commonly bisexual, I just can't understand the fuss. I think Stone is depicting the most accurate portrayal he can (considering it was 2300 years ago!). I myself reckon the relationship with Hephaistion was probably more physical than was shown, it's possible Stone was holding back in order not to create yet greater offence. The only really stupid thing about this film is the Irish accents, I can't imagine what Stone was thinking here, has he done anything like this before?? Since they would all have been speaking Greek anyway the choice of accent in English would seem immaterial, but the Irish just stood out too much as being totally wrong. Should have gone for English (like Troy), American or just let everyone speak in their own regional accents and be done with it. The Irishness just made it seem comedic. I request - everyone doing their own accents and more boy on boy sex!"

","Sitting through Alexander was a bit of a trial. The movie is exceptionally well filmed and the history of Alexander well conveyed. The movie is daring in the sense that it does not cover up the fact that bisexuality was perfectly normal and accepted, in fact even a status symbol, lifts it above many other historical movies. I found the movie poorly acted. Not that any of the actors were downright bad, but some of them (Jolie) were a bit over the top and the rest were not really exceptional. It was a good movie, but being no big fan of Farrell I was not impressed. I was pleased to see that he actually does possess acting skills. However, as the movie progressed I was more taken with his capability to show more than one side of Alexander. By the end Farrell had proved that he was actually an actor. But no one actor can make a movie better. And Farrell struggles against other actors who certainly do not perform their best. So all in all the movie would rate 5/10 in my books."
"starfire146","6","0","1","2 January 2005"," Oscar Caliber Acting Lends a Helping Hand to an Otherwise Tedious Movie
","At times this movie seemed little more than an outrageously expensive History Channel documentary with an A-list Hollywood cast. However, Colin Farrell did an excellent job at portraying Alexander, he has definitely proved himself to be a deeper actor than many thought he could be. This type of role is definitely out of the ordinary for him, and i think this Irish actor proved himself more than worthy of it. At times, this movie lacks the female touch, but this is understandable because Alexander was at war much of his grown life, where women were typically not found. Angelina Jolie, however, gives a top-notch performance, actually making Alexander's life away from the battlefield worth focusing on. Her character demands to be noticed every minute she is on the screen and she blends just the right amount of sinister evil and motherly love to keep you guessing just how honest her intentions are. Val Kilmer, although barely recognizable underneath scars and a hefty stomach, also gives an excellent performance. His role as Alexander's father puts him in an awkward position to audience members as we recognize that he is mainly a negative impact on Alexander's training as opposed to a father figure. Although I would have liked to see more of a warrior from his character we can not fault the actor, but rather the writers for this omission. Although Farrell gets most of the screen time in this movie, the supporting actors are oftentimes what keeps the audience watching from one scene to the next."
"davidburndy","5","0","1","1 January 2005"," too long
","Too many wrong things to mention, too long of a journey to take. The bulk of the three-hour film details Alexander's defining campaign, his slow 22,000-mile trudge east, a crusade to dominate and then liberate Persians, Egyptians, Indians and anyone else in his path. He's viewed as a conquering hero in Persia, but as he moves further east, further from home, he's met with less enthusiasm by those he liberates, as well as his own troops, who long for home. But driven either by a hunger for a lofty place in history, a need to top dad (Val Kilmer as Philip), or his vision of One World, he ignores their complaints and marches on.<br/><br/>At about the same rate that Alexander is losing his supporters, Stone is losing his audience. We long to admire Alexander the way Anthony Hopkins does - we're an audience hungry for heroes these days - but ""Alexander"" doesn't deliver."

"sinanonline","3","0","1","24 December 2004"," Temptation to rewrite history
","Although the cinematic technique of the movie was successful and I enjoyed many aspects of the movie, including the camera, the performance of Farell (Alexander) and Jolie, (Olympia) and the use of symbolism, I did not enjoy the movie in general: The movie fails to generate a correct experience of 4th century BC on the audience and also fails to discuss the personality of Alexander in this environment. Considering the historical nature of the movie, it is the social duty of the director should make an effort to present the reader with an accurate outlook of the era and the personality of the historical figure in question.<br/><br/>*** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** One of the most disturbing aspects of the movie was its naive handling of the issue of bisexuality. The nature of the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion is never clarified in the movie. This approach actually would have been the best approach, only if Leto (Hephaistion) had not received such focus in the movie: When the director aims to present us the personality of Alexander, and the relationship is mentioned over and over again throughout the movie, the audience expects to learn the director's opinion of the true nature of the relationship. Whether Alexander shares sexual experiences with Hephaistion remains a mystery for the audience.<br/><br/>However, if the director had taken care to present us a view of the Hellenistic Period conception of sexuality - an issue on which it is possible to find an immense number of material - then we would have the chance to experience the world of Alexander and his personal response to it.<br/><br/>Another important point is the incorrect presentation of the concepts of ""freedom,"" ""nationality,"" and ""fighting for homeland."" Before the battle of Gaugamela, Alexander makes a statement, claiming that the Greeks (""Hellens"" would actually be the correct nomination) are fighting for their homeland. Geographically and historically, this statement is wrong. At that point in history, the Hellenistic army is more than 1000 miles away from what may be considered the outermost borders of the original Hellenistic homeland. In fact, it is actually the Persians that may feel they are fighting for their homeland. Similarly, Alexander makes a statement that the people are fighting for their ""freedom."" However, we know that Alexander was proclaimed king after his father, and the monarchy, unlike the democracy of the city-states does not imply ""freedom"" of the people, but expects the people to be ""subjects"" to the monarch. There is no point in a king claiming that his subjects are free, whereas the subjects of the Persian king are not; they are both subjects! Similarly, considering that Alexander has enslaved the inhabitants of Thebes just four years before Gaugamela after a revolt by Athens, Thebes and Peloponessus against the Macedonian rule, it would be difficult to assume that the Hellenistic peoples of these cities would consider themselves of the same ""nation"" as their Macedonian rulers or ""free"" under the Macedonian rule - as opposed to the democratic city-state rule.<br/><br/>It is not difficult to understand Alexander's motivations: Instead of fighting for ""freedom,"" ""nation"" and ""homeland,"" (which are concepts of 21st century and appear as political agendas only in the last 3 centuries) Alexander was fighting for creating a unified world, the concept of ecumene, and he aimed to achieve this through a policy of conquest, reconciliation, mixed marriages, equality to Hellens and Persians, (homonoia) Greek being made the universal language and unified coinage. It would make much more sense to present these ideas (ecumene and homonoia, unification and harmony) as the high ideals of Alexander, instead of the made-up concepts that appeal to the audience of today but are historically incorrect.<br/><br/>In the same light, Alexander is portrayed as a naive lover of warfare and battles, and his political personality is not discussed at all. He had quite a lot of achievements after returning from his last campaign of Porus, most notably making the Greek language official language of his empire as a step towards creating a unified people. His political ideals are not discussed at all in the movie.<br/><br/>In addition, the costumes of Persians are mixed up with the traditional costumes of Arabic peoples. Similarly, the costumes of Sogdians are bad versions of traditional Turcoman costumes, and their dances appear to be a corruption of traditional Caucasian dances with an absurd hint of Indian dances. In fact, Roxane calls Alexander ""Skender,"" which is the Turkish form of his name. This is as absurd as giving Rome & Juliet costumes to Julius Caesar just because they share a geography - or as absurd as having Toltecs perform a Mambo in a movie that would describe pre-colonial America. Sogdians or Skiths have no significant cultural relation to Turcomans and neither do Arabs of today to the Persians of Hellenistic period.<br/><br/>Instead of creating a real personality of Alexander, the personality is idealized into an idol for the average audience of the 21st century. Similarly, the conceptions of the Hellenistic Period are presented in the mockery of what they really are. It is a pity that possibly the most noteworthy persona of the world history is discussed with such a ""light"" approach in such a high-budget movie. To compare, Achilleus is - successfully - given a ""human touch"" in Troy, and the history is presented, although briefly, in a scene where Agamennon and Menelaus discuss the projected Hittite response to a possible Trojan victory, whereas in Alexander, even though Alexander is a real person and Troy is a legend, the history is twisted into a 21st century caricature, and Alexander's personality is discussed in extremely shallow terms."
"jeaniebaby001","6","0","1","27 December 2004"," It wasn't as bad as they say...
","I have to say I just went to see it all excited and without reading the bad reviews that I'm reading now...and, I thought it was great and very entertaining! The strange ambitions and great acheivements of Alexander almost seem unthinkable to anyone. How can anyone living in that time take a large army and just decide to trek across so many countries, uniting them all at one point in history? Stone's version managed to explain it quite well, and that's the key, to a good story about Alexander the Great. The movie was 2.5 hours and worth every moment! 6.0/10<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW----><br/><br/>Good points: Great psychological explanation from Oliver Stone, regarding Alexander's choices in life. I was never lost in the journey, considering it was so epic. Everything was so believable too, and small historical facts were addressed (Racism, monkeys, poisonous snakes, typhus...etc) Great acting from Angelina, breathtaking moments of acting and surprisingly believable and seductive Greek accent. Can you say, hot momma? The city of Babylon was so beautiful. Almost makes you wonder why he doesn't want to return. Hot Persian King... Good job from Collin Farrell, he was never out of character. Jared Leto's role made a great sensitive companion/best friend for Collin's Alexander. And in terms of the sexually charged scenes between them (although you never see them go at it, dang!), if you could stand that scene between Sam and Frodo while they were on the volcanic rocks in that third LOTR movie, you can stand this. It doesn't go beyond hugs... :( They picked a good young Alexander too...looks exactly like Collin and is in about twenty minutes of the movie. The fight scenes were amazingly real...almost makes you feel like you were there with the army. Elephants!<br/><br/>Bad points: Brief moments of imperfection in cinematography, especially in the first war. The flashback towards the end was a little jarring...wasn't smooth. The fight scenes can get messy with poor camera work, but it does make the struggles seem real. What's up with Val Kilmer? Anthony Hopkins' acting was lukewarm stereotypical..he looked very old... They never saw the Pacific ocean...:("
"breezer030","6","0","2","26 December 2004"," What strange accents!
","I went to see Alexander and - even though I had no high hopes - it managed to be a bit of a disappointment. The story line was rushing from one battle to the next with some ""emotional"" acts between them. There was no clear message what kind of a man Alexander was. And then the accents: Alexander's mother would have been better cast in a James Bond movie as a Russian spy and there were a lot of Irish accents around. Very strange. I would have preferred no accents or only sticking to one. The battle sequences were okay although most of the times it was not clear how the battle progresses until suddenly one side won. Even a bird's eye view could not compensate for this. The sets were fine although at some points it looked like they didn't construct windows but only painted windows (especially in the set where Alexander first saw his wife). The music was terrible. Music by Vangelis is not appropriate for this movie! It reminded me too much of Chariots of Fire. Bad choice that music. Colin Farell was not very convincing as a man that was suppose to rally a whole army to fight an overwhelming enemy. The movie may be historically accurate but I had better hopes for a movie about Alexander the Great."
"Clossius","2","0","2","25 December 2004"," intentionally trashy?
","Although a bona fide European, I really disliked this movie. It gets a 2 rather than a 1 for a few good features, such as some of the battle scenes, which were needlessly gory but otherwise very good. They compare well to those from ""Troy"", which was an unmitigated disaster but not as bad as Alexander. The entire thing seems like a trash movie, with no acting involved, or even attempted. Is anyone able to listen to someone in 2004 to the pep talks of Alexander to his troops without wanting to throw up (""Ride, my brave Macedons, ride!"")? All seemed like amateur theater. And in the end, the movie was expensive, but not expensive enough. The oedipal touch was just embarrassingly superficial and wholly unbelievable; the homo-erotic and heterosexual touches just funny. Three hours wasted."
"e-ra","2","0","2","25 December 2004"," Not worth your time
","Alexander was, quite frankly, one of the worst movies I have watched in my life. Mr Stone tried to make this film into some kind of masterpiece, having everything from romance to adventures, action and philosophy, picturesque sceneries and meaning, but he achieved none of it. The film goes on for over three hours without a plot, in fact without much action. You see quite a few lengthy, disorderly fighting scenes, without any hint of relevance, sometimes absolutely nothing is happening and you have a narrator tell you a story like in a really badly made documentary, in other scenes you have some sort of artistic slow motion which makes the film look like some kind of advertisement. Some of the dialogues will be long remembered, sadly for being absurdly nonsensical (did anyone read the script? Anyone?). Relationships were apparently very important in Alexander's life, notably those to his father, his mother and his closest friends, or servants, but his mother and his homosexual inclinations are given a lot of time, with absolutely nothing to show for it. The ridiculously misplaced and overlong back flash towards the end of the film actually made me quite aggressive. I am left wondering what became of Oliver Stone, whom I admired so much for his early films."
"Bigbert","5","0","2","25 December 2004"," A very expensive, but mediocre documentary
","This movie is really in a mess. First off it jumps all over the place and needs the narration of Anthony Hopkins to try and keep the audience aware of what exactly is going in. This is a true weakness and makes this movie look more like a documentary than a real bio-pic. It covers some key-points, or what the makers feel are the key points, of Alexanders life. This is not offered chronologically or in any other logical order (it even starts with his death). And while Hopkins is narrating away, his mother played by Angeline Jolie decides to do voice overs as well. Heck, we only lack the expert-historians to make this a true documentary.<br/><br/>All characters seem very artificial and evoke absolutely no sympathy whatsoever. The movie looks OK and the battle scene is quite good. Even the music by Vangelis is just mediocre and can be described as a cross between his music for 1492 and funnily enough some John Barry 007 themes.<br/><br/>Not really worth investing time in I would say; try the Discovery Channel instead."

","I don't know what I was expecting when I walked into this movie. I guess, something along the lines of Troy. Whatever I had in mind, it certainly wasn't what I saw. <br/><br/>The movie started out just fine. The 3,000 year old Anthony Hopkins narration gave the impression that the story of Alexander was a great one, and one that was worth telling. But the more I watched, the more I began to realize how wrong this impression was. The movie just seems to drag on and on, without any arc in the story. Just a straight line, hanging low to the ground, consisting of yawn-inducing dialogue and a few battle scenes which each gave me a headache. That shaky camera technique works just fine on the small screen, but in a theater does nothing to add realism.<br/><br/>The biggest gripe I have isn't really about the length of the movie, (I began to wonder if the movie lasted longer than Alexander himself), but that the use of music is deceiving. Around the second hour of the movie, by the time most movies would normally wrap up, the use of dramatic and triumphant music began to get over-used. This kept causing me to think that the movie was finally over. The picture would fade out, and we'd be back to the old Mr. Hopkins and his narration. He'd mention something incoherent, and then we'd be back to Alexander. It was at this time that people started to leave the theater. From this point on, every 20 minutes, that dramatic music would play and the picture would fade out. Each time I was eager to think that the movie was ending, but then it would start back up again.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie I was actually angry with boredom. Call me immature, but that's how much I didn't like the movie. If you asked me to think of one interesting point in the movie, I'd be at a loss for words. Just don't bother seeing this movie unless you want to spend seven dollars for a three hour nap."

","This movie's total disregard for historical facts makes this movie almost unwatchable. For starters, including Angelina Jolie as the watchful mother of Alexander is one of many mistakes Stone make, why is she in it? How can Stone or anyone know anything about her character or her influence on Alexander? It's not just poor history, or rather wild speculations from the director's side but also totally unconvincing and irrelevant to the story of Alexander and his development.<br/><br/>There are so many scenes of this movie that doesn't make sense, and the sudden retrospective look at the fate of Alexander's father is illogical. Farrel makes for a poor Alexander, his portrayal doesn't really give justice to Alexander, of whom we really don't know much, at least the movie could have tried to make a realistic version of the great Macedonian and his exploits.<br/><br/>The movie has one great moment though, the final battle scene when Alexander and his army fights an army with elephants, flawlessly filmed with added surreal colors creates an incredibly tense atmosphere and scene, when the movie concentrates on the battles of Alexander, and not his mother or other women it is so much better. IF only this movie had been done by a director who understands Alexander and the story it would have been a much better. More battles, less talk and speculations please.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie would have done better without Jolie. There are some strong moments in this movie, the scenery, the battle scenes (especially the one at the end) are extraordinary and where the movie and Alexander comes to life, but it fails miserably in all other aspects. There are a few things I like about this movie the mentioned battle scenes, the eagle seqense, but if you can avoid this movie, I suggest you do."

","I went to see Alexander, after chatting with a neighbor. I found the movie to be somewhat interesting and informative, for the following reasons: Although much of the script did focus upon Alexander's bisexuality, however, I feel that it also focused on the influence that his mother had upon him. She used her attachment to snakes to assist her son in eliminating his fear, not only of snakes, but also fear of his potential greatness. Sometimes it is easier to be mediocre, than rise to one's level of competence in life. I also felt that through the character of Alexander's first lover, there was a portrayal of how wisdom can help our loved ones attain greatness, for in reality, not only was this young man his lover, but his conscience, as well. Aristotle, Alexander's teacher, believed in the superiority of the Macedonian race.However, by answering Alexander's challenging questions about other nations, he opened the door for Alexander to seek further answers, which started him on his way to greatness.It is interesting that the nations Aristotle felt were inferior to Greece, were the very nations that kept ancient Greek philosophy alive during Europe's Dark Ages.<br/><br/>Alexander was not only able to conquer neighboring countries, but he did so with nobility, by allowing many of his subjects to retain their status, and somewhat their cultural identity. This is very important to a person. His men followed him, because he first pointed out their noble deeds, then whatever constructive criticism was necessary. However,unfortunately, like many leaders, Alexander did not know when to quit while ahead. It is also interesting that upon the death of his noble steed, and his ""conscience""(lover) his death soon followed.<br/><br/>Wars and conquerors will always rise. However, it is how the battle is fought and won that will remain in the hearts of those watching. I went in to view the film with certain questions, and I left the theater, with my answers."

She's the most enjoyable character in the movie. She's so cunning, and dangerously clever like planning the kill the father so Alexander could become king. I could also say that Alexander's wife from Persia had sense too. every actor in this movie did a good job. Val Kilmer played a good king. Make-up artists for this movie was great.

I was astonished how sagaciously Stone has abandoned the main part of the real story: Firing Perspolis! yes, he fired Perspolis, when her sweetheart, Tais asked her. I know why: In western history he is called Great Alexander. But can he be a ""GREAT"" man when he firing Perspolis?!!!!

He made a Hollywood epic and an honest portrait of Alexander the Great, but narrowed down the the character of Alexander to a one dimensional person. He followed the historians of Alexander but added unimportant and lengthy scenes with his mother. The outcome is an unbalanced big and honest movie with some of the best battle scenes we have ever see. Colin Farrel and Antony Hopkins are excellent as well as the rest of the Macedonian generals, but the face of Darious loosing the battle is something to be remembered.

","Sadly, I went to see this movie, fully intending to poke fun at it with my fellow geek like friends. We're all history buffs and we're studying ancient Greece in our class. However, as I was watching it, I realized that it was too awful to even make fun of.<br/><br/>I first realized what I was getting into when they quoted Virgil in the starting sequence. A ROMAN author quoted in a Greek movie.... That was beyond irking.<br/><br/>Then it only got worse.<br/><br/>Olympias went from madly in love Philip to hating his very soul. She became manipulative over her son, and somehow, Alexander goes from a blood thirsty, vicious, natural leader, to a woman. (I'm sorry to my fellow members of the female race.... he was weaker than a woman) Not only that. They cut out most of the important battle scenes! The Crossing of the Hellespont, The siege of Tyre! And his entire stay in Egypt! Oliver Stone, in his focus on the small and controversial, focuses on Alexander's homosexual tendencies, which was normal back then! Not only normal, but it was expected! This movie continued and continued in a downward spiral as he went deep into India, somewhere he never went, and on the way married Roxane, who was actually a Bactrian princess.... No political value my.... Yah, anyway, Rosario Dawson was awful, and her breasts were so fake that I'm sure the man didn't even find her worth looking at.<br/><br/>On top of all these wrongs, Ptolemy alludes to the fact that Alexander's death might not have been natural.

I couldn't tell that there was anything really ""heavy"" between them, and the camera seemed transfixed on Leto's eyes. Anjelina Jolie had a strange and unneeded accent, and looked only three years older than her son.

"Nimak","Null","0","1","17 December 2004"," From a Persian point of view!
","I agree with most of you guys on being bored by the movie, confused of Alexander's motives of uniting Euroup and Asia!, cast (though I liked Jolies play), lack of the bound between the narration of Hopkin with the rest of the movie (it didn't fit!), and so on. In addition to those comments, I have to say that the movie was an insult to my nationality and my homeland, Iran. I'm not trying to say that Persians were perfect, nobody was,is, and will be! But the movie gave the viewers the impression that Persians were barbarian, though Alexander himself, both in the movie and in the history, was astonished and impressed by the Persians and their civilization. I do not know why in the narrations of Hopkin, he calls Persians as being barbarian over and over again, it is not just these narrations! Roxana's political position in the movie is reduced to a nobody, though she was the princess and the daughter of Persia's king. I think that there was an ignorance towards the Persians. Otherwise,how come is it that in the violent scenes of the fighting between the Persians and the Greeks, there is not even a scene of a Greek being killed by a Persian?(It's probably true that the Persians were fighting just because their king wanted them to. But it's also true that the Persians believed that the king was someone chosen by God to rule over them, and so, most of them were ready to do anything for their king. So, it wasn't the case that they didn't fight bravely against the Greeks, and probably many Greeks were killed in that bloody war.)Though this is not the case with the fight between the Indians and the Greeks.Remember, the Persians remained loyal to Alexander till the end, on the contrary to the Indians. And why Stone and the writer didn't pay enough attention to the Persians, how they looked like, and the way they talked? Some details that have to be taken in consideration in any historical movie! Rosario who plays the character of Roxana, doesn't look like a Persian! Persians were not, and are not so dark-skinned! And the language that is spoken among the Persian armies in the beginning of the battle, sounds rather Arabic than Persian.(A mistake that many people make that we speak Arabic! However,when you're going to make a historical movie, you have to be more accurate and pay more attention to the details than common people. Many people collect their information about other countries and their nations from movies and other advertising media of the western world, and not through the history books or unbiased media.) It wasn't any director, it was Oliver Stone, who gave a false image of the Persians to the world, who are hardly familiar with The Persians! Very few know that while Alexander was obsessed with his love for his own sex, and many were killed brutally by the Greek soldiers, and many places were burned to ashes, and the Greeks were confused which god to pray,..., the Persians worshipers only one God, and Cyrus the Great, King of Persia was the first person in the history of mankind to value freedom and equality of people and talked about human rights( long before the uprising of Alexander). As I mentioned earlier, the Persians were not perfect, and there were some cruel rulers among them who killed many, but they were not barbarians for sure. Actually, Persia is one of the oldest countries with one of the oldest civilizations on the earth!"

","I have just returned from contemplating the movie Alexander. That was my first sign that the movie wouldn't get a wow review from me. If i have to think over the aspects of it, it really didn't hit a home run with me. That is not to say that I thought the movie was a wash either. In fact i would give the movie about a six and a half.<br/><br/>The movie starts out in a good spot giving us a glimpse of his home life, something that very few people see or are even interested in, as evident by the many posts i have read. It lays out the mothers teachings for young Alexander and how he is forced to see his father based on that teaching. I think this plays a critical part in the movie because it give us a glimpse into why Alexander strove for what he did. He is taught that he is greater than his father and never to be afraid to grab for what he wants. He also learns a very valuable lesson from his father. That greatness comes with sacrifice. <br/><br/>But like i said i had to think these things over. It was made obvious at times that this may have been what drove him. <br/><br/>I think Angelina did a fantastic job at her role. If ever there was a man hating woman obsessed with power and control it was her in this role. The snakes that surrounded her seemed to give her character another aspect because they were much like herself. Snakes were seen as devious creatures ready to strike but also willing to wait for the right moment. She seemed to spit her venom most effectively at Alexander just when he was feeling weak or coming to a new challenge. <br/><br/>Which brings us to the last notable character. Alexander as played by Colin Ferrel. He play his best role in this movie. He seemed to capture the feel of a man who is thought to take everything in moderation, and is surrounded by excess. It shows in the movie that he does practice restraint at the beginning but in the end is swimming in over indulgence. At the first battle scene he turns away his love because it was believed that sex before a battle would leave a man too drained to fight. He portioned his drinking with water until the water was tainted in the monsoons and was forced to drink the strong wine. He continually resisted the temptation of the eunuch until he was drinking the wine. He wanted nothing more than to be loved, but as power over took him, he wanted more. That final indulgence of power was the one that ruined him. I think that this movie did a great job of showing his slip from purity into semi-madness very well. <br/><br/>As for the ""gayness"" of the movie. I think that it was tastefully done. Their was never more than hugs, tearful confessions, and longing touches until Alexander kissed the eunuch and that was only because he was cheered on by the crowd. In all actuality the movie only shows this part in hints and subtext. On the other hand, the consummation of his marriage is right there for all to see openly and vividly. <br/><br/>On a personal note... did you see the men that Alexander fell for? Absolutely to die for sexy. I've never seen Leto look hotter.<br/><br/>Lastly the only thing that i would say was wrong with this movie is that at times you could tell it was a movie. I was never so fully drawn into it that i forgot where I was."

","I'm a fan of Alexander, and I wanted to be a fan of this movie, but I just can't be. Though decently cast it's got some serious problems in other areas: horrible editing and pacing, questionable direction, and (frankly) bad writing. They all tried hard, but it just didn't come together.<br/><br/>For starters, the film is harried by the monster that so many biopics fall prey too, lack of focus. There's so much to consider. What gets skipped over and what gets included? How are these incidents most effectively portrayed to show the character of the subject? Oliver Stone did not answer these questions well.<br/><br/>We spend some time with Alexander as a boy. Then, all of a sudden, he's grown up and been disowned. The movie blinks again, and he's waging war on Persia. We're given a few scenes with his parents, but Ptolemy tells us it was with his friends that he found a home. The film gives awfully little to back this up, yet the drama of the mutinies that come later depend on it. When Alexander is going up against his nemesis, Darius, I don't feel like I know him or his men. I certainly don't know why he's great. I've no clue of his military genius and little of his incredible ambition.<br/><br/>Where are the incidents that shaped Alexander as a young man and proclaimed his character to the world? The Gordian knot? The destruction of Thebes? The pardoning of the Athenians? They talk about Alexandrias, but we never see one founded. And as for Gaugamela. I'm sure Stone thinks we know what's going on, but we don't. I never even heard the words 'hammer and anvil.'<br/><br/>From Gaugamela on it seems like Stone is doing his haphazard best to cram in every story he can about Alexander's last 8 years. The film degenerated into chaos. The center could not hold, and mere anarchy was loosed upon the movie theater. At the point when a film OUGHT to be building toward a climax, I was starting to feel like one of Alexander's troops. 'Please, sir, can't we just go home? Can't this movie to end so I can see my wife and children again before I die!'<br/><br/>Worse, as the film plods on and Stone struggles to fit in all that is Alexander, he keeps returning to old Ptolemy in Egypt. Ptolemy seems fond, not only of wasting time telling us what we JUST SAW but also of injecting flashbacks which would have played much better if they had just happened in chronological order. I was lucky enough to have studied Alexander's life in college, so I had some grasp of what happened when. The person I attended the movie with, however, got totally lost.<br/><br/>Here are a few tips, Oliver. 1) you can tell a story chronologically OR start in medias res. Pick one. You can't do both. 2) you're not allowed to turn everything on the screen red for 10 (VERY LONG) minutes and have your hero's life flash before his eyes unless you're going to kill him RIGHT THEN! 3) show, don't tell, and certainly don't do both.<br/><br/>Then there are the host of errors that might have been forgivable if they'd been alone or at least ignorable if they hadn't been so persistent, like some of the bad dialogue. What was with the accents? How on god's earth could they spend all that money on armor and weapons and military training (I saw the special on TV; I know they did) and not get Colin Farrel a voice coach!? Half the soldiers seemed to be Irish or Scottish, and Olympias and Roxane were apparently both raised by Slavs. And his HAIR! Why does Alexander have dark roots and eyebrows? Why does Hephaistion wear so much eye-makeup in battle?<br/><br/>On a more thematic note, I'm not sure even Stone knows what his Alexander's motives are. I appreciate ambiguity when it's well done, and Alexander's drives may have been difficult even for him to understand, but his goal was to liberate everyone and blend the races? Come on, man. Seriously.<br/><br/>Everyone's talking about the gay stuff. I didn't have any problem with it except how it was done. Physical or non (and, from what I understand, most historians think it was) Alexander's relationship with Hephaistion was certainly one of the most important of his life, though they didn't do anything in the movie except exchange very manly hugs. Yet Stone has Alexander in bed with some Persian guy. <br/><br/>Straight, gay, and bi are modern concepts about sexuality that don't really fit into the world of Alexander. Some preferred one gender to another, but experiencing physical and/or emotional love with either or both was normal. The Spartans, some of the most feared soldiers ever, practically institutionalized homosexuality. The Sacred Band of Thebes, the army Alexander helped his father defeat and then mourned over when he was 18 (which was NOT in the movie) was made entirely of pairs of male lovers and was unbeaten for a generation. That said, I know portraying Alexander as what is thought of now as bisexual in modern America is a risky thing for a filmmaker to do. I say to you, Stone, if you're going to take risks, then take them, dammit. Don't just give Alexander a brief fling. Give him a love story.<br/><br/>In fact, as a lover of ancient history, let me add that, if you are going to film epics concerning the ancient world, please do a decent job. In part, that means limiting yourself. In the end, the movie just tried to do too much. As a result, it didn't do anything well. Focus was lost, and so were important elements of Alexander. The effort (especially by the good cast) is appreciated, but this is the sort of cruddy job that convinces directors and producers not to tackle film projects concerning ancient subjects, and that is not cool, man. Not cool."

","A bunch of us went despite the general run of the reviews 2 weeks ago. We knew the history of Alexander fairly well, knew that Oliver Stone is a good director, were patient and curious, and were not expecting either a Masterpiece of Modern Cinema or an Action Blockbuster. I wanted to see how Stone handled his huge, sprawling subject and was prepared to enjoy a realization and treatment of the story. The film was not disappointing.<br/><br/>Risks Stone took: <br/><br/>1) Filming the thing at length. This is no action film with one or even six exploding climaxes. Fitting all of Alexander's character, all those events, and the extent of A's conquests into a single film is !#@# near impossible. The history itself has no easy, dramatic climax; to create one, Stone would have had to fake it. The choices he made were, for Hollywood, respectful of his material --for example the conspiracies compressed into one, the details he omitted (Aristotle's nephew, the Helmet in the Desert scene, e.g.), the two battles he did cover -- Gaugamela was impressive.<br/><br/>2) Presenting Alexander's bisexuality.<br/><br/>3) Choosing to portray a human Alexander, *and* the myth/effect of what he was, but without creating a superhumanly palpable will and superhumanly palpable charisma in his actor. The latter could have been attempted by means of cinematic smoke and mirrors, perhaps? Farrell's acting job was great, but the role contained its own dissonance, the difficulty of combining mythic-level greatness with an observable human psyche, and this in the shadow of the Greatness Myth narrative itself. I think this explains and supports what another viewer noted about Farrell's performance not being as compellingly heroic as others.<br/><br/>Yeah, Olympias is a four-note character, but most of my girlfriend dynastic queens who survive in violent court politics are, too.<br/><br/>All the jumbles and excursions and ups and downs in the film are in the histories. Alexander's fault, not Stone's. Suggestions: Arrian's Anabasis for the history; Plutarch's Life of Alexander for more history, moralizing, and stray gossip; Stone for an ambitious treatment that brings the story to the screen."

If there weren't exchanges of lustful looks between he and a few pretty-faced, pretty-haired men, there was a man-whore fireside dance, with two guys entangled, all greasy-looking. Even the native Nepalese (Himalayan) were disgusted, and did a good job of acting thoroughly grossed out when Alexander french-kissed that dancer.<br/><br/>It seemed like Oliver Stone (et al) was trying to use this blockbuster film as a vessel for another controversial film where an historical figure is portrayed as homosexual. Such a Hollywood stunt sickens me.<br/><br/>Maybe it was just me and everyone else in the theatre I attended, but the snickering, and whispering turned into people saying ""aw, gross!"" out loud.<br/><br/>Besides that, the film was epic.

I noticed that the story and script failed to point out a few important parts of Alexander's life, most importantly, his epilepsy.

"damien-16","3","0","3","11 December 2004"," Why did Oliver Stone make this movie?
","Oliver Stone has made some very powerful movies, tightly scripted, brilliantly acted. He has the ability to make a seemingly boring subject gripping and, why not, entertaining. But not so in this case. The story goes nowhere, the people move around aimlessly, the camera work looks like sloppy MTV. One big problem is of course the choice of actors. Many already commented on that. A bigger problem is the script. How do you hope to catch the viewer's attention if you start your movie with 10 minutes of a mumbling Anthony Hopkins saying nothing of interest? And, for good measure, you add on another 10 minutes of empty mumbling at the end? Not to speak of the 3 hours of boredom in between. Maybe someone thought the flashbacks within flashbacks were clever. But they simply were inept attempts to hide that there was no plot line. Which brings me to the biggest problem of all. Why on earth did Oliver Stone decide to make this film? He has made good films, he has made bad films, but never indifferent films. He always had something relevant to communicate. I would say that most films of Oliver Stone are historical films, but if i'm not mistaken, this is his first ""historical"" film, in the sense of classical times, peplum etc. Maybe that's the reason. This is not his usual turf. I wonder though what Ridley Scott would have made of Alexander."

"DICK STEEL","Null","0","1","4 December 2004"," A Nutshell Review: Alexander
","In recent memory, a film by Oliver Stone will naturally attract controversy like bees to honey. Gone were the days when stories were simplier and shorter (Platoon), and nowadays 3 hour bio-epics are norm (JFK, Nixon).<br/><br/>Not that I disagree strongly with the portrayal of Alexander as bisexual - hey, men in those days married and had sex with females only for reproduction of heirs. But having such portrayals rammed down your senses scene after scene, tires you. You have Alexander showing zero interest amongst scantily clab women in tribes conquered (good?), but instead you have him gaze with lust upon nubile pubescent men, and kissing them, and embracing his lover Hephaistion, while exchanging sweet nothings each time they're together in a scene. I reckon if Oliver Stone had his way 100%, we'd see a sex scene or two between them too. But instead we get the obligatory one between Alexander and his Asian bride (oh yeah, it's a woman)<br/><br/>Blame it on Aristotle and his teachings on freedom of love.<br/><br/>What is missed most, I believe, amongst simple people like us, are the scenes of war. When one thinks of Alexander, one thinks of the conquests which he had (which made him The Great, no?). Sadly, this film only features two - one in Persia, and the other in India. Nicely film, with the blood and gore you'd come to expect after films like Gladiator - great costumes, weapons, decapitated limps by blades on chariot wheels, impaled bodies from spears, elephant trunks being cut off, you get the drift.<br/><br/>The rest of the time is spent on politicking, backstabbing, alcohol parties, and an ooh-lala mummy (Jolie rocks) sending notes and warnings and speaks funny. The purpose of these scenes to highlight the rot in his empire, could be brought out better if the pacing is tighter. But they ramble on and on.<br/><br/>Archilles Wannabe. Yeah. Son of Zeus, probably not."
"TKnight_1","Null","0","1","4 December 2004"," I would have rather done homework!
","Where to begin? The question WHY is the first that comes to mind. Why can't epic fight scenes be filmed in a way where we actually SEE what's going on? What is this trend as of late to make the camera as jittery as possible and the cuts as random and quick as possible during large scale battles, of which there are only TWO in all of Alexander's three hours? There is sometimes nothing but shifty gold chain-mail on the screen. Literally nothing else. Just armor going back and forth for no reason and in-between shots of Colin Farrell's dumb-struck expression of which he manages to slip into every scene. Is this supposed to convey the confusion and horror of warfare? It certainly disorients. But last time I checked that wasn't the point of going to the movies.<br/><br/>Before I sift further through this heap of ridiculous dialog and imagery, let me point out four good things about Alexander. One: the scene when he tames the horse was cool. Two: Rosario Dawson is nude for one scene. Three: Lot's of close ups of Angelina Jolie Four: The scene when Alex goes up against an elephant is cool too.<br/><br/>None of these are reason enough to waste your time. I should have stayed home and written a paper for my Gov Ec class instead of seeing this film. The music is purposeless and downright cheesy during long speeches and far too short fight scenes. The acting...well, there's too much of it. Nobody is just being natural in this movie. Everyone is trying to be Creek or Roman or a Tribesman or an Indian or something. And Colin, well, he's better suited for Dare Devil. A resurrected Bull's Eye would be a better fit than the role of Alexander.<br/><br/>I'm busting with bad things to write so let me focus on other criticisms. People are complaining that there's too much violence. It's a movie about war. What are you expecting? When two armies run together they're not doing so to drop the sharp things they're carrying to hug. If anything there's not enough violence. There's far too much talking and thinking and moaning and complaining for a movie about a man who's supposed to be the tough guy to end all tough guy's. <br/><br/>And I think the brutality of Alexander, the true strength and iconic status which this warrior possessed, could have been shown even with the bi-sexual element remaining. The man-love in this movie didn't irritate me because I'm against it. I honestly don't care. What irritates me is the way it's portrayed. The scenes between Alexander and the guy he loves (I can't remember his name to save my life) are written horribly. The dialouge is utterly cliché. It would have been just as awful if it was a scene between the more traditional man and woman. This is my point, that the frustrating thing about the character is not that he's bi-sexual, it's that it's Colin Farrel trying to act bi-sexual. It is impossible to believe that these two are actually in love. Not only are their faces unconvincing, the way they say their lines is as if they were uncomfortable to do so.<br/><br/>And because Colin tried to handle this ""feminine"" side to the warrior as best he could, the barbaric side is completely lost. Alexander is a whinny little boy. The female characters are much stronger than he. The duality to this man should have been left in the hands of far more experienced actor, and dare I say it a far better writer/director than Oliver Stone. It would have been very interesting to see a bi-sexual warrior in a well-done film. It could have been controversial on a much larger scale and could have exposed American audiences to something they're not used to.<br/><br/>But my main point is, why take away battle sequences that could be both artistic and entertaining (which would also provide depth to Alexander) and substitute them with unending speeches about glory and death and betrayal and yada yada yada. This film is bad. Plain and simple. It is almost not worth the time I've spent to write about it.<br/><br/>In the end, I come back to the question of Why. Why are people making movies like these, spending years and millions to produce something that is so obviously unnecessary. The people in the audience were more interesting than what was on the screen. I found myself checking my watch more times than I can count. And I have a long attention span!<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and stay home, or just watch BraveHeart or Gladiator again and call it a day."

He alternated between being a man who hated his mother, and being completely under her control and relying on her. She, as well, seemed to go from unresponsive to him, to being in tears over the harsh words he says. She is, at times, a frightening character. The relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion was one of the best things about the film, and the reason that I will keep going back to see it, and buy it when the DVD is released. I was very disappointed that the two only exchanged hugs. With the beautiful, touching words of love spoken in that balcony scene, if one of them had been a woman, they would've kissed and gone to bed. Since both were male, we were never allowed even a little kiss. Something as simple as that would've left me feeling far more satisfied with the portrayal of their relationship. Hephaistion was the more serene of the pair, balancing out Alexander's passionate nature. The looks they exchanged and the things they said to each other did not make me uncomfortable. In contrast, I was extremely uncomfortable during the whole wedding night scene with Roxanna. I felt that the breast and groin shots were gratuitous, as if the director were trying to make it (the 'homosexual' scenes) up to the heterosexual men in the audience."

Guagamela was a real high point for me, and I just loved the soundtrack. I think a lot of complaints over certain details are a bit ridiculous. Alex was likely bisexual, but then that was the norm for ancient greeks, so I could understand the struggles and subtlties between Alex and Hephastion. If anything, it enhanced Colin's performance, since so little is known about Alexander or most of the people in his life. Even overacting and scene chewing is preferable to nothing. These were the days of epic characters, so I think it suits the actors to play them larger than life.<br/><br/>It's interesting to compare this film to Richard Burton's portrayal (a much cleaner, glam version), and I'm curious to see how DiCaprio handles the role in his version.<br/><br/>It wasn't Stone's best work, but I wouldn't say it is as bad as many so called critics like to think.

Unfortunately, the thing then grinds to a halt, with the audience being left to drown in a sea of pompous speechifying (the climactic speech by Alexander in India is particularly excruciating), dull photography, unmemorable music and creaky acting. The least bad performance was that of Jared Leto as Hephaistion, Alexander's male love interest.

The one segment going back EIGHT years to Phillip's death wasn't necessary in the middle of the movie. He could have easily brought that flash back around in another manner.

","Oliver Stone makes films I love or hate. 'JFK' is one of my favorite films: it shines in spite of the presence of 'Cavein Causesnore' in a starring role. 'Nixon' was great, as was 'Wall Street.' And then there were 'Natural Born Smellers' and 'The Boors.' Now comes 'Alexander', a film that hadn't premiered before factions picked sides about the portrayal of the lead character's sexuality. Additionally, an early summer medieval spectacular (What was that film's name: Coy, Foy, Poi?) crashed and burned shortly after takeoff. Even with those challenges, I felt that Stone's film deserved a look. To me, 'Alexander' is a surprisingly good film albeit with jarring portrayal flaws. Anthony Hopkins gets the unenviable duty to narrate: his scenes play long and his elocution is so arch it's more Richard Burton than Hannibal Lector. Val Kilmer reminds us that he can overact any part to death. Angelina Jolie is 'Mother from hell,' an unsympathetic role she handles with aplomb. Inevitably, the film rests on Colin Farrell's shoulders and Farrell delivers an unexpectedly human conqueror, a believable, sympathetic man; he is a man more at ease gathering nations under his wing than ensuring that he produce an heir for his kingdom. He accepts innumerable pleasures from exotic people without veering into loutish hedonism. The film never loses sight of this conqueror's most telling trait: he saved his trust and love for the one person he had known and loved since childhood. Alas, this film will vanish to make room studio-conceived blockbusters, perhaps 'Friday the Thirteenth, part 207' or, 'Surviving Easter.'"

","I don't like this movie at all. The only good thing about it is Colin Farrell that plays the role as Alexander the great. A homosexual child, who grow up with only his mothers love, a bit too much mothers love perhaps. His father is eventually murdered, and he becomes the king of Greece and the story continues..<br/><br/>I really like the acting from Colin Farrell, but that is also the only thing I like. The movie does not feel realistic. They somehow picked the wrong actors to the wrong places. Why is Angelina Jolie playing the mother Olympia? Anthony Hopkins only look old, and got no inspiration.<br/><br/>The movie is very long, and it feels like they knew that, so they cut it down and removed parts of it to make it shorter. This however makes the movie feel incomplete, with missing fragments. But still the movie feels too long.<br/><br/>I don't understand why they couldn't make this movie better. Troy for example was given a lot more enthusiasm it feels.<br/><br/>5/10 with a bit of a bad taste for a epic story that could have been good, but ended in a mess."

","I am very upset of the way movie Alexander is made. First of all, Alexander was just a psycho sadist maniac that wanted to prove he could defeat the greatest empire of his time.He was also envious toward our great wisdom and knowledge that he had discovered earlier through teachers like Aristotle which themselves developed most of their ideologies from Zoroastrian Magi's of Persia (something that I call Plagiarism!) <br/><br/>There are the following points that I find to be very biased and discriminatory in this movie: <br/><br/>1- They have chosen a half-black lady to be the Persian Princess! Didn't we have enough qualified persian ladies in US, especially in LA area that could possibly play in this role? 2-Most of the persians in this movie look like Mexican Maya and Aztec tribes to me.Couldn't they care more in representing a close resemblance to how a persian would have or should look like? 3- Since when Greeks and especially Alexander were Blond and white with tiny noses? Even Angelina Jolie who normally has darker hair color and complexion is a blond Greek ! Do they try to prove that Greeks were western and therefore white and we were black and dark and arab looking form the beginning? 4-In my opinion the movie is all about how great and courageous Alexander was in contrast with a dumb cruel Dariush the Persian king! They try to show how great and essential it was that they beat such a nasty barbaric empire and saved the western civilization as a result! Even their historians acknowledge that Greek and western philosophy and civilization could not be if the eastern influence and especially the Zoroastrian Persian one is not regarded.So Alexander in fact did do a huge favor to the Greeks and later on to the western world by mixing Greece and Persia and adopting and transforming the Persian civilization into their own- of course without even giving any credit to us-at least not in this movie!"

","I have been waiting for this movie for over a year now, ever since I found out that Colin Farrell had landed this coveted role.<br/><br/>I had predicted back then, when I knew nothing about the movie, only that Colin Farrell was working on it and that Oliver Stone was directing it, that this could possibly be Colin's first opportunity at getting an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>I was that confident in his acting skills.<br/><br/>I still am.<br/><br/>I just didn't anticipate Oliver Stone to be such a terrible director.<br/><br/>I was shocked to notice that some scenes were out of focus, jittery and just downright badly shot.<br/><br/>The CGI stuff is supposed to look real, not CGI.<br/><br/>The movie did start slow. Even the opening credits were long. That was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins role should have been trimmed down. <br/><br/>That first scene were he is telling the story of Alexander and a scribe is jotting down everything he says looked like a set. <br/><br/>It looked manufactured. <br/><br/>It looked fake.<br/><br/>It didn't feel real to me.<br/><br/>And it was just too darn long.<br/><br/>I love Anthony Hopkins but I felt like I was being lectured to.<br/><br/>Once the story gets going, we see a child Alexander terrified of the snakes his mother, Olympias (played by Angeline Jolie sporting the most atrocious accent ever) is playing with. <br/><br/>This is a foreshadowing scene because we see her surrounded by snakes in every single scene she's in.<br/><br/>Whether that's subtext for the audience to realize that Olympias is just as slithery and venomous as a snake or it's just a ploy to make her look exotic, who knows?<br/><br/>But it is definitely used as a ploy for us to make sense why later on, as a grown man, Alexander is attracted to Roxane, played by Rosario Dawson with an equally appalling accent, and decides to marry her.<br/><br/>We are to believe that because Roxane wears the same snake design armlets as his mother does and because she bears a similar profile to Olympia, that he fell in love with her at first sight.<br/><br/>First of all, Rosario Dawson is far from beautiful. Yes, she's attractive and exotic looking but not beautiful like Angelina Jolie is.<br/><br/>And no one in their right mind would say there is a resemblance between the two.<br/><br/>If that was the intention, then Dawson was miscast and another actress, one resembling Angelina, would have been a better choice.<br/><br/>Later on we see a young Alexander played by Connor Paolo who played Travis on 'One Life to Live"". I recognized him but couldn't place him so I had to look him up on IMDb.com. So I was a little surprised to see a child soap actor in the movie. He did a good job, considering the material.<br/><br/>Finally, one hour into the movie, Colin Farrell shows up on the screen with his blond locks.<br/><br/>Granted, he's not a very attractive blonde but with time, it grows on you and you forget that his eyebrows are light brown in one scene and dark brown in the next.<br/><br/>Well actually no you don't. You actually obsess and see how many times they goof with the eyebrow color.<br/><br/>At first I thought it was intentional. I thought they were meant to be darker as he got older to show age. <br/><br/>But then a couple of scenes later, when he's supposed to be older, his eyebrows are back to a golden brown.<br/><br/>I know that Stone had to reshoot some scenes because he used bad film stock and maybe that's why we see the discrepancy but it was just a bit annoying.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were okay. Not amazing or impressive as in 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator"".<br/><br/>And the musical score was terrible. It was all wrong.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone probably picked Vangelis to work on this film primarily because he is Greek.<br/><br/>But this is the first time that Vangelis has ever scored an epic film and it shows.<br/><br/>His mostly known for his work on 'Blade Runner' (a sci-fi movie) and 'Chariots of Fire' (which was how many years ago now?? Oh yea, over 13 years). He has recently worked on 'Bruce Almighty' and 'Old School"", a couple of not very epic movies.<br/><br/>So while John Williams (of 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones' fame) or Hans Zimmer (who scored 'Gladiator"") or James Horner (""Braveheart' and 'Troy"") would have been much better choices, Stone picked Vangelis who should definitely not get an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes in the movie is the battle with the elephants. But the climactic scene is given away in the trailer so when you see the scene unfold, you already know what's going to happen.<br/><br/>Many scenes could have been much shorter. This movie could have benefited from some expert and smart editing. <br/><br/>The movie dragged at times and while we get a narration provided by Anthony Hopkins throughout the movie, we aren't given enough time with the character of Alexander to really know what is going on in his head.<br/><br/>He keeps his men in the dark and the audience is right there with them, not knowing why Alexander makes the choices he makes.<br/><br/>I know that Alexander's life story is not all factually known and a lot comes from myths and legends and conjecture, but I would have rather Stone given him some solidity even if made up so that we knew what drove this man to carve the path he traversed while alive.<br/><br/>The whole bisexuality issue wasn't as present as I expected it to me.<br/><br/>In truth, Colin Farrell only kisses one man in the entire movie. And while there are innuendos indicating that he slept with men, more importantly Hephaistion (played by Jared Leto as a complete and total wallflower who will stand by Alexander no matter what) and Bagoas (played by newcomer Francisco Bosch, looking as pretty as ever), the most they did was throw heated lusty looks at each other and hug.<br/><br/>Beyond that, nothing else happened and it was all implied.<br/><br/>So even Stone, known mostly for his controversial views, shied away from really exploring the bisexuality of the time. Anti-gay activitists should have no big problems with this movie. But then again, they need something to believe in and fight for so let them rally.<br/><br/>This movie isn't one of Stone's best. It isn't even one of Colin Farrell's best. Nor any of the exceptional actors in the movie.<br/><br/>I totally blame this on Stone. He dropped the ball big time. Or maybe he just lost his fizz. <br/><br/>He intended this to be his opus and he failed miserably. He sunk a lot of money into this movie and I fear that he will not be able to regain it all back in box office sales.<br/><br/>Word of mouth will get around and hurt this movie's performance in the box office. It will probably have a strong first opening week, but will quickly die after that.<br/><br/>Granted, the movie isn't terrible. It does have some good elements in it and could have definitely benefited from a healthy dose of editing.<br/><br/>But it's over and done with now. Not as good as 'Braveheart' nor 'Gladiator' not even equal to 'Troy' which had a better storytelling style, but it's watchable and enjoyable in some parts.<br/><br/>If you are still curious, go see it. But keep an open mind."
"sarastro7","7","0","2","6 December 2004"," Too maligned
","I didn't think this was a bad movie. The problem that many people seem to have with it is, basically, that there was more history than entertainment in it. It was one director's honest, realistic and no-holds-barred interpretation of the life of a great figure from history, warts and all. Oliver Stone deserves kudos for this achievement, though I'll also say that the movie had a few problems.<br/><br/>Most people - incl. myself, actually - had undoubtedly expected something more entertaining and action-filled. There certainly was action in it, but the action played second fiddle to the up-close-and-personal psycho-analysis of Alexander. We saw him as a very troubled figure. Not as much of a conquering hero, nor a character we could particularly care about. He had an interesting idealistic vision of the great cross-cultural civilization he would build, but we never really get into his mind about this. Instead, we see him worriedly trying to deal with a sea of troubles that beset him at every turn, mostly in the form of his Macedonian soldiers who don't agree with his conquering tendencies. This is all good and well, and a very valid and interesting take on what actually happened, but it fills too much in the movie, and takes away from the portrayal of Alexander the person; it undermines our chance to get a good understanding of the attractive sides of his ideas and visions. Possibly, Oliver Stone doesn't think Alexander's visions were that attractive, and possibly he's right. But Alexander is such an important, seminal and thoroughly adventurous historical figure that the viewer expects to see him as a confident, almost heroic, conquering pioneer. It's no fun to have him psychologically deconstructed. We have academic papers for that. The populace at large needs affirmation of Alexander the Great's actual greatness. This movie did not provide that. It was too serious; too ambitious. It kind of forgot that it was a big-budget Hollywood caper. But who knows, maybe sober posterity will look more favorably at what it was trying to do.<br/><br/>The homosexual aspect didn't bother me that much, but then, I'm a tolerant person. The average movie goer, it seems, is not. Because clearly a lot of the bad rap this movie's gotten stems from people not being able to stomach the whole gay thing. Which really wasn't anything to make such a big fuss about. Before I saw the movie, I'd heard that there would be ""offensive"" homo-erotic scenes in it. There wasn't. Sure there were a few scenes emphasizing the orientation and such (and one where Alexander kissed a male member of the Babylonian king's harem), but there wasn't any unsettling gay sex scenes, and what overtly sexualized ""gayness"" there was, was quite tastefully done. (Of course, the boy who was raped at a party by some soldiers was an exception, but that was shown for the sake of realism.) One thing I thought was overdone, though, were the several shots of the male harem member (whom Alexander brought along on much of his journey of conquest) which had him looking down, bowing away, etc., emphasizing (particularly in the minds of the audience) that his presence was shameful. This shouldn't have been done, but it's a minor thing.<br/><br/>Probably my biggest point of criticism is about the accents. I don't mind some of the actors using their own accents (like Farrell), but I mind some of the actors being given clearly artificial ""barbaric"" accents. This was not very consistently done, and esp. in Rosario Dawson's case it was very grating. And that's really too bad, because it ruined the whole atmosphere of many scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, however, I thought the movie was pretty good - certainly better than Troy -, and there were many spectacular scenes of Babylon and great battles, which I really enjoyed watching. I would have been happier, however, with a movie that had emphasized adventure and entertainment a little more. <br/><br/>7 out of 10."
"christopherinrussia","Null","0","1","6 December 2004"," camp classic
","Alexander is a total camp classic; it is so bad it comes around the other side and ends up fun, but not for the reasons Stone intended.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is out of control and over the top--she is channeling Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest, Bette Davis in All About Eve, and Yvonne DeCarlo in Exodus (come to think of it, this whole movie is a tribute to Exodus). There's a line about how she gets ""no respect"" from her son that is so overwrought that you expect her to whip out wire hangers as Exhibit A. For some reason she also decided she needed to play the part with a Russian accent.<br/><br/>Everyone else has an Irish accent. Even Jared Leto, who is American (I guess they thought that it would be too jarring in context if he didn't speak with a brogue). It's like Tom and Nicole in Far and Away (except that movie was actually about Irish people). Who new that Macedonians were actually a lost Celtic tribe? And then there are some Macedonians who have thick, treacly Scottish accents. Very Braveheart.<br/><br/>Even the sound track sounds like it should be about British glory--there's a bit near the end that sounds like ""Jerusalem"" mixed with the Chariots of Fire soundtrack. I kept expecting the Macedonians to shout ""For England!"" as they surged across the plains unfurling a Union Jack.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell's hair is a whole other issue. He looks like Meg Ryan with a beard (a very dark, hairy beard). Why would you not also bleach those black Irish eyebrows, or at least take them down to an auburn while you're at it. Jared Leto's hair is even worse. He has this stringy Jesus thing going on. Saxons and Angles and Visigoths and such all had bad hair, but Greeks and Macedonians and Romans all have pretty good coifs, at least on their statuary--so why go out of your way to give your characters historically inaccurate bad hair?<br/><br/>Most scenes set East of Babylon look (fittingly, I suppose) like they were shot in Las Vegas--there's a sort of fire dance floor show number set in India that is straight out of Showgirls (except that Stone uses showboys).<br/><br/>And Alexander is definitely gay, no question about that, except he is gay in a Hollywood circa 1980 way, like in Making Love, where that male characters just hugged each other a lot like superbowl winners while Kate Jackson got all upset.<br/><br/>All in all, I had several good laughs and agreed we would pay $9.25 to see it again."

","SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER Note before I start this review: I went to see Troy thinking that it was gonna be really bad and campy, but I was pleasantly surprised... I came into this movie thinking I was going to be pleasantly surprised also...but I wasn't--and to those who thought that this movie was good and those who don't like it are the masses who want simple plot lines, get over yourself (you probably liked Lost in Translation (which, btw, also tried too hard))<br/><br/>OK, comment on the acting, I actually didn't realize Val Kilmer was in this film, he did an outstanding job :-) The rest of the actors, well, they weren't so good. I could tell that they were taking their jobs seriously, but I never believed for one second that they believed in a single word they were saying. They were trying too hard, their dialogue didn't come natural, I could feel them acting<br/><br/>The battle scenes were good, chaotic and hectic, just like a real battle. However, this took up a minor portion of the movie, if they were to make this an action flick, I would so dig it. An artsy friend said that they were attempting to re-create some paintings of Alexander in battle, and upon reflection, I could see that, but I do have some problems with the battle scenes: 1. In trying to re-create the painting scene, they focused too much on a character to the point of hilarity, for example, in the first battle scene, the director showed an intense frontal shot of the enemy, but held on so long that it got funny 2. What is up with showing the parallel between soldiers' legs and the camels legs, that was plain funny 3. Um, a horse vs elephant in the Hindustani battle scene, you don't look heroic bud, you look kinda stupid, it takes away from Alex's greatness<br/><br/>Great set designs, great re-creation of the Gates of Babylon<br/><br/>That was about all the good things I can say about the film, here's where it goes wrong<br/><br/>1. We never see why Alexander is Great. Anthony Hopkins builds him up, so I think we'll see either a great character study or a great war epic, but instead, there's no pay-off. Great job as an old cook tho<br/><br/>2. Alexander looks like a wimp. We see only two battle scenes really, then the rest is, well, i'll get to that later. It looks like Alexander miraculously wins battles, and the moment he loses one, he wimps out and runs home. OK, yea, it was 10 years and time to go home, but despite its length, we don't feel the amount of time that has passed in the film<br/><br/>3. They spend time going through childhood and explaining the Greek myths, but they didn't use it as effectively as they could have, it's about half an hour of build up to explain one line in the movie, not to mention that the horse scene was dragged out and didn't reveal as much about Alexander as it could have, it felt like a horse whisperer rip-off<br/><br/>4. THE GAYNESS--OK, this is where I may give the actors more credit, because by the looks they were shooting each other, I spent most of the time going, just F*CK HIM ALREADY!! There were a lot of cop out hugs, and I know that they didn't want to make a big deal out of Alex being bi, but by requiring the actors to shoot those looks to each other, then spend most of the dialogue and movie ignoring that they even made those looks, gets really distracting. Acknowledge with a PASSIONATE kiss and move on. <br/><br/>5. The attempt at greatness gone awry: I saw in a recent interview that Stone wanted to have three relationships: parents, Heph, and his wife. Like I said, Kilmer was great, but I never believed Jolie as the mom, I didn't get the sense of desperateness for self/concern for Alex. The Hep relationship I guess was supposed to be Platonic, but all the looks just made me angry. (There's also the obliviousness of when Heph is dying because it make Alex look stupid) The wife didn't seem to have a relationship with Alex, just a baby-making machine. I thought that's how it was supposed to be after watching the movie, but seeing the interview, I now criticize this because the homo-eroticism dwarfs this. Other attempts at greatness are the wanna be great speeches that get cut off by the director, the love of his people that we don't see, the non-depiction of how Alexander is the Great Pharoh and founder of many cities.<br/><br/>Those are the specifics about why I didn't like the movie, but generally, the film tries really, really hard to be good, but that much effort is distracting. It tried to show everything at once, but merely glances over everything."
"rawashjr","4","0","1","5 December 2004"," Somewhere in there is a decent movie.
","I had great hopes for Alexander. A bold, influential, and fearless historical figure having his story told by a director with the same qualities. I expected it to be great. It could have been great. It wasn't. It treid so hard to be bold, influential, and fearless, but it came out as scatterbrained, confused, and fickle.<br/><br/>Editing is important to storytelling in films. In Alexander, we are taken from King Phillip telling him that he'll never be king to Alexander leading his armies as king in the largest battle of his life. This is a major jump with no credible link. We do not even know who is fighting or why its so important. Who is King Darius? Why does Alexander want Asia so badly? Why do his men trust him so much? We get some of this in hurried dialogue, but we need to see it before this scene. I know some of the history and the battles which lead up that one are important.<br/><br/>Another problem with movies that try to tell someone's life story is that they lose focus. This would have been a good movie if it dealt with Alexander's life up to the Battle of Gaugamela it would have been a tighter presentation. All of the relationships and personal dynamics could have been explored against the backdrop of the war with Persia. Darius could have become more than a stoic face that filled the frame for what I guess was an attempt at menace. Again focus on the story and the characters, not the events and personal antics. Mario Van Peeble's Badassssss is a perfect example. Its a different type of movie but deals with the same type of man.<br/><br/>The movie centers around one event, one struggle in his life, against which the rest of his personalty and relationships play out. A much tighter and more hard hitting presentation overall.<br/><br/>I wanted to be able to give this a 8 at least. Instead, I'm forced to go with a 4."

","1. I hate to put this first, but the music was terrible. Distracting and detracting. It was worse than the music in Troy.<br/><br/>2. The movie was marketed incorrectly. The trailers depict this movie as being about a heterosexual waging all kinds of awesome, gruesome bloody warfare of ""epic"" proportions. This movie is actually about Alexander, and while glaringly inaccurate at times, does show more about the man himself and acknowledges that ""gay,"" straight,"" and ""homo/hetero-sexual"" have no meaning in Alexander's world.<br/><br/>3. The movie expects, or at least *requires,* you to know more about AtG other than the fact that he existed. While the big picture is easy to follow, people who don't know a lot about the man get lost in the details and the disjointed editing. These two things to people who have studied/researched AtG are not problems and in fact make the movie quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>4. Miscasting. While I could write a whole dissertation about how the cast does not match up very well with their characters, I'll leave that to each his own. I would have cast virtually everyone different, with the notable exceptions of Gary Stretch as Cleitus and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Cassander.<br/><br/>Though I might have made Rhys-Meyers Hephaistion instead."

Jolie wasn't bad but her accent didn't fit the period either. As you watched you were never able to feel the length of time the army was in the field. Seemed more like 7 months instead of 7 years. Battle scenes were fairly good but the computer enhancement was very noticeable. One did get the feel of the hand to hand chaos. Actors did their best with a bad script.

Aside from the main battle, the acting was atrocious, the dialogue even worse and too much of it. It would have been better to stage the battles he led and make the movie out of that instead (the battle sequences and stunts were great) because that was the extent of this movie's quality and it was perhaps 15 minutes' worth.

For Hollywood to portray every great leader in history as a homosexual is folly.

I have great respect for Mr. Stones accomplishments in his Profession, but this was a large mistake. The whole of the world does not embrace homosexuality and to alienate the vast populace that is not by throwing such a blatant celebration of that lifestyle in our faces is not only disrespectful, but unwarranted. Virtually every man that was anyone in this film was portrayed as homosexual, while the women of this movie were for nothing more than producing heirs. Achillies gay? Come on!

","Be aware that you will be seeing a movie that is just short of 3 hours long. Make your own intermission when you need to.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone tried to do too much. A friend of mine commented that it would take 3 movies to cover Alexander The Great's life. The movie tries to get too much of it in. During one battle scene, Stone shows us the chaotic, on the ground struggle between the men trying to kill and not be killed. He also shows us a bird's-eye view - literally, following a bird in flight - of the battle from above! The filmmakers want us to understand the strategic battle plans of Alexander. It was too much to understand, but it was a valiant effort.<br/><br/>Was Alexander's wife black, as in the film? I doubt it, she was from Bactria. What were the Bactrians like? I don't know. <br/><br/>Sometimes the flowery language, as in epic films from 40 years ago, works and sometimes it doesn't. But at least Stone doesn't attempt to modernize the language so much that he puts modern American slang terms in, as many other filmmakers do in films about ancient times.<br/><br/>Cinematography and the look of that ancient era is fantastic. The scene with the Hindu Kush mountains (eastern Afghanistan) was breathtaking, but very brief. Don't know where it was filmed, but it LOOKS like the Hindu Kush. The scenes in ancient Greece/ Macedonia which show the athletic contests at public events and the crowd scenes were very realistic and if you use your imagination you can put yourself back in those days on those streets. Which is one of the reasons we go to the movie theater, it can't be achieved by waiting for the DVD! <br/><br/>I learned enough to make me want to read more about Alexander. Although some of the dialogue was not good, and accents were all over the place, if you go in there not expecting a perfect movie but wanting to be transported back 2,300 years - then consider seeing it. You might learn about someone who accomplished more in his last 10 years than almost anybody since has done in a lifetime."

","If I need to put all my thoughts on this movie, I could become the best MOVIE critic in the country. I am a movie guy and I ve been watching 3 generations of movies. <br/><br/>Alexander.the movie ! I agree with the guy here who said that Oliver Stone conveniently changed the story for the sake of making a movie. First of all why the movie is made in this way ? I have seen at least ½ a dozen documentaries on Alexander in the TV. ( History Channel, Discovery, National Geographic etc ) and now I saw Alexander in the Theatre is there something different ? NO. In the TV there were historians anchoring the story of Alexander and in the movie it is Ptolomy. GIVE US A BREAK !!!!<br/><br/>Next, Alexander is a King, a conqueror, a warrior why are we bothered about his bisexuality even though he is one.i don't know he is anyway. Next WHERE ARE THE WAR scenes ? This is a Movie and every one expects at least 3-6 war situations there are only 2. Brave Heart, Troy and what not else ? is better than what I saw Alexander. <br/><br/>Now the Story !!!! There are many situations where the story is Changed. For example Alexander asks the daughter of Darius ( King of Persia )<br/><br/>How do you want me to treat you ? <br/><br/>She says as a Princesses and Alex is impressed with the ANSWER !<br/><br/>Actually this question is asked to the king POROS ( king of India )<br/><br/>The elephant battle ( against king Poros ) was won by Alexander and later on he gets hurt in a battle in India in a place called Mali.<br/><br/>In the movie it shows that the Elephant Battle is the last battle fought !<br/><br/>Lets talk about the conversational scenes !! I think depth in dialogues and script is better in movies like Cleopatra and Gladiator in the modern times.<br/><br/>But when it comes to action ! Every one did their bestcant ask more than that ! <br/><br/>ALL AND ALL Alexander DID NOT WIN THIS WAR ON THE MOVIE<br/><br/>Thank you !!"

","This movie, along with Any Given Sunday, proves that Oliver Stone is an awful director. He has, quite possibly, been responsible for the two worst movies ever. Alexander moves slowly, but is incapable of drawing its audience to care about the characters (character developmnet being an appropriate use of a slow pace). The latent homosexuality is not a problem, but the director isn't sure what kind of message he is trying to send about it. There is also a striking like of ""flow"" to the movie. I understand that its supposed to be based on a series of historical events, but the director makes them look almost completely unrelated. Also, Colin Farell is not an action hero. You almost want to laugh, rather than be inspired, as he tries to pump up his army before battle."

If the point of the movie is to show that for his time and for being a mighty conquerer, he's quite a liberal guy, (bisexual and biracial marriage)well there's plenty of movies with characters with liberal qualities. From my point of view there is no point and frankly you'd be better off watching the History Channel's show on Alexander.

","""Alexander"" will be remembered is as the only movie that managed to make Colin Farrell, let alone Jared Leto and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, seem unsexy. <br/><br/>No it's not because they are playing gay men (and they aren't bi-sexual -- Alexander only gets it up for a woman with a knife at his throat when he realizes he needs an heir). While the script makes several jabs at the film ""Troy"" for portraying the Achilles/Patroclus relationship as familial rather than as lovers, at least that mess luxuriated in the male figure homo-erotically; this may be the only sword-and-sandals epic where almost the only part of hunky male anatomies we see are eyes and flowing hair. Russell Crowe was plenty sexy in ""Gladiator"" with virtually no romantic scenes. <br/><br/>The actor playing the young Alexander does look extraordinarily like Farrell, but the untying of the Gordian Knot is not presented as terribly exciting. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone films are usually distinctive for their in-your-face editing, but only two battle scenes enliven the long story. And those mimic Christopher Doyle's color coded cinematography in ""Hero (Ying xiong),"" as first one is covered in desert sand and the second in a forest of blood (and I did keep wondering how elephants were fitting between the trees in an Ewok-like terrain). <br/><br/>Women, as usual in any Stone film, get short shrift but they are used more confusingly than his other work. Poor Rosario Dawson has to endure a naked scene that's violently animalistic before she turns into a nag - how can she whine about returning to Babylon when she's never been there? <br/><br/>The casting of Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother made some sense in the early scenes of his childhood, but the decision not to age her twenty years is just annoying. We are perfectly capable of realizing their Oedipal relationship without having them appear as their actual comparable ages to make it creepier, let alone constantly surrounding her with snakes as some sort of inappropriate reference to Eve. <br/><br/>Her Transylvanian accent just sounds silly, even if it fits into the geographical premise, though the occasional maps don't really help amidst the confused use of both ancient and contemporary geographical terms. I suppose it's a comment on the history of talking film that has portrayed Ancient Greeks as high class Brits that the Macedonians here all speak with variants of Farrell's Irish accent to indicate that they are usurpers. <br/><br/>I was looking forward to the long movie finally ending with Alexander's death but no we had to suddenly endure what seemed like a half-hour flashback that was supposed to add mysterious motivations to the anti-climactic death scene and could just as easily have been put in chronological order."

","The world is a confusing, chaotic mess, and in mankind's futile attempt to make sense of it he mythologizes those that came before in hopes of forgiving the transgressions of his forefathers and providing a sense of optimism for the uncertain future. It's this type of mixed message where leaders can turn from visionary hero to over-indulgent tyrant in the blink of an eye, combined with grotesque parallels to current geopolitics (care to take a look at Afghanistan and Iraq anyone?), and a discouraging moral relativism marked most prominently by the rampant bisexuality of these ancient marauders that has sent those critics and viewers who get scared by the gray areas of life all a flutter. Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' is a big, audacious, confusing, bloody mess of a film. During its entire three hour run time I was on edge, never knowing what type of over the top directorial flourish (witness the climactic infrared elephant battle royale), weird psychosexual subtext, or insane acting performance was awaiting us in the next frame.<br/><br/>For all it triumphs (the creatively staged battle scenes, the opulent Babylon, the subtexts and symbolism, the passionate performances), there were a few damning distractions. The love story between Alexander and Hapheastion was as cheesy as the type of heterosexual romance you would find in a 'Titanic' or 'Pearl Harbor.' Also, while Angelina Jolie's other-worldly accent whose origins can only be known to her dialect coach adds yet another fascinating layer to her fine art of scenery chewing, the Irish and Scottish accents of the Macedonians and Greeks are ridiculous and lift you right out of the alien world Stone has placed you in. Still, I would take this all instead of the over-ripe dullness of this year's earlier and only mildly entertaining Greek epic 'Troy.' You see, in the bizarro-world of Hollywood, a monumental failure from the likes of an Oliver Stone still towers over the greatest works of a lesser director."

","A friend of mine aptly summarized the movie as ""Go East"" and, indeed, most of the movie details Alexander and his army marching east, conquering as it goes. If you like military battles, don't go see this. There is only one of any decent size, and it isn't very good. If you like plot, then don't go see this. As far as I can tell Alexander left the plot behind when he began the journey eastward. Too bad he didn't go back for it. The movie was mostly about Alexander's personal life and the meaning of his life. It's controversial (Alexander was homosexual) but that just makes it worse that the furthest they dared to go was show one kiss. He spouts off all movie about how Hephastion (sp?) is his soul mate but then the movie carefully avoids implying that they slept together, as if afraid of alienating its viewers, or maybe getting blacklisted by Christian conservatives, which we now know comprise at least 51% of the US, ha ha...[crying]."

","Oliver Stone's Alexander was one of the few interesting films of this year. Although the story did lack the normal plot structuring of other similar films (Gladiator, Troy) what Alexander had that Troy lacked was a central point of morality. The story, although it constantly threw Alexander's bisexuality in the audience's face, gives a great inside look at how power can cause even the most powerful man on Earth to be morally decayed inside. The graphic shots of the battle scenes, the main goals and feelings of Alexander,the musical score as well as awesome recreation of the cities of Babylon and Alexandria made this movie far better than what some critics may have said. If people would get past all the homosexual innuendos in the story and look beyond that, I think that they would find a strikingly well made, emotionally moving film. Recommended."
"detjon","Null","0","2","1 December 2004"," Just to set facts rights
","I just wanted to set few facts rights. Alexander the Great was not at all Greek as the movie claims, is simply a fiction. <br/><br/>Sorry if this might not be helpful to you, but i believe a movie which is based on historical events, should be more adequate on his facts and what is trying to portray. When they go into such length to make a movie about certain historical figure you would expect them to do more research into background, not simply on what the common belief is.More explanation underneath.<br/><br/>It is not surprising that filmmakers or even historians cannot capture the whole picture of Alexander the Great. <br/><br/>First of all, his mother was from an Illyrian (Albanian) tribe. The original name of Macedonia was ""Emathia,"" which in Albanian means ""the great land,"" hence the appellation Alexander the Great. (The same was true with Constantine the Great and Justinian the Great, all from the general area of Macedonia. Sometimes the area was more inclusive during the Roman times).<br/><br/>To capture Alexander the Great as a soldier, one need only look to the successive generations of Illyrians to witness their exploits. The Albanians literally took over the Ottoman Empire with the Kuprili family -- of obscure origin from Albania. <br/><br/>In Greece in the early 1800s, Lord Byron witnessed the Albanian families fighting for Greek independence, and the first president of Greece was George Kondouriti of Hydra, an Albanian. In Egypt, Mohammed Ali, who made himself king in the early 1800s, was of obscure Albanian origin. The first prime minister of Italy, Fancesco Crespi, was an Albanian.<br/><br/>It would be difficult to change the understanding of Alexander the Great as a Greek, but it is fiction and not fact. The truth would be told if one would understand what Alexander the Great was by ethnic birth -- an Illyrian (Albanian) -- and the research exposed the characteristics of the ethnic Albanians throughout the centuries. <br/><br/>It would be a remarkable accomplishment to put to film and book alike in a more truthful light. Audiences would really come to know the fact and not the fiction."

What were you thinking? This had to be a case of nobody having the balls to tell the emperor he was naked. My opinion is not based and has nothing to do with the homosexual ""undertones""(they weren't quite on the low low) great, he liked guys who wore massive amounts of mascara, how about you show a couple more longing looks between Alexander, and his one true love. This movie had no steady direction, or flow, much like Alexander and his quest, it all ended up in a giant mess. The sets were beautiful, the battles looked good, but were hard to follow. This was one of those movies that made me so angry, because they blew it. Why can't there be critics that work for directors, not like Ebert and Roeper do, but offer up the hard advice a lot of movies need? Oliver Stone if you actually thought this piece of garbage would move anyone in a good way, you must live in a different world from most people. Also all of you geniuses who liked this movie, and defend the constant reminders of Alexander's homosexuality, need to understand that it's not the idea of him loving another man that was wrong, it was the film's obsession with it that was wrong. Stone must have had a Macedonian enemy, is my guess. You know he really wanted to stick it to the Balkans or something.

For example, I found Troy did a much better job of presenting many well rounded characters.<br/><br/>2) If I am going to an epic, I don't want to spend three hours watching a mother-son fight out their relationship. The movie needs a strong external foe to Alexander to give me something better to connect with.

Yet his love for his boyfriend seemed to be either the main point, or brooding just under, about 2/3rds of the film.

"lsejellook","Null","0","1","30 November 2004"," Troy was more entertaining
","This film was fairly accurate to most historical accounts but as far as entertainment, which should be the purpose of all movies (in other words you shouldn't be going to the movies to learn about history Hollywood while remaining fairly accurate does take dramatic liberties with certain things that can distort what actually happens) this movie fails miserably. I sat in my seat for most of the movies three hour length wondering when it was going to end. Probably the most controversy being raised over the movie is of the so called homosexual scenes. First, it is important to remember that the idea of homosexuality did not exist in the lexicon of ancient times. It was not uncommon in ancient Greece for men to have male lovers but they did not for the most part forsake their wives for these male lovers. So yes Alexander probably had a male lover, was it a dramatic event between he and his wife when she finds out, most definitely not. <br/><br/>Colin Farrel does a fair job of playing Alexander and seems to channel a range of emotions that we have never seen in a character that Farrell has played. A particularly good scene occurs when Alexanders army is threatening to desert him and he lashes out at his men. Colin Farrell does however seem to overact in certain scenes that could have been more low key. In some respects he plays Alexander as though he is constantly on the battlefield. Angelina Jolie channels her inner psychopath (this seems to be fairly regular for her now) playing Alexanders mother Olympus. She is a constant reminder in Alexanders life that whatever he achieves he will never be good enough. She would have it were he to rule the entire world. Angelina Jolie does a good job for the most part in her character. The best actor in the movie with probably the most realistic portrayal is Val Kilmer as Alexanders father Philip of Macedonia. His scenes are well acted especially those where he is teaching Alexander the ways to be a good king. <br/><br/>The movie as directed by Oliver Stone comes off as one big surreal experience. Stone attempts way to much imagery in the film leaving the viewer confused as to what the heck these symbols actually are supposed to represent. Stone does have an interesting way of telling the story. The story is not so much told chronologically but rather events are expressed as they become important to the life of Alexander and as far as that goes Stone does a wonderful job. However overall the portrayal that Stone presents of Alexander seems just a bit too dramatic rather than a purely historical viewpoint. The problem is that we never become attached to Alexander as a character in the way that Stone wants us to. <br/><br/>In short if you're looking for an entertaining movie dealing with the ancient greeks I would recommend Troy. If you enjoy over the top acting and dramatic crying scenes with odd imagery then by all means see this movie. I give it 6/10"

I watched the History Channel's several hour special on Alexander.<br/><br/>Those two things alone probably made me hate the movie much more, but I have a feeling a lot of people that see this are going to agree it's crap anyway. Thinking perhaps he is unique in doing so, Stone decides early in the movie to focus on Alexander's sexuality. Okay, yes, he was bisexual. Many Greeks at the time were. NO BIG DEAL. But apparently this is a big deal for Stone, and he emphasizes Alexander in the bedroom more than on the battlefield, cheapening the man that conquered a huge area in such a short span of time. If that weren't enough, Farrell plays Alexander like he is an emotional fool - crying for more scenes in the movie than most men have cried in probably a lifetime. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I doubt Alexander was forever whining and crying as much as he is in this film. <br/><br/>Since I knew the real history, I was shocked that the story had been changed so much to reflect weakness instead of power. At over a three hour running time, this movie is a real waste to see, and is even slower considering Stone uses slow motion in many of his scenes. No part of it is worth watching, and the performances are sub-par to the point everyone employs there own little foreign accents to seem like they are part of the time.

Why did Stone choose to keep his Irish accent? Why did Stone give Irish accents to the rest of the army? Jolie at least tried to make it a Greek accent, and Val Kilmer kept the good old American accent. The film in characterization is very inconsistent. Now, as for the bisexual part: Alexander very well may have been bisexual. I don't know, and we today don't know, because none of us were there. (If anyone out there has been reincarnated from Alexander's time, please let me know). Whether he was or not is unimportant. It was normal. Men had sex with men back then. Here is where I take issue. The man may have been bisexual, but his true love would not have been for the man. This is bologna, and it was a choice the writer made. In making a big deal of this, an agenda was being promoted.

Although, at Alexander's death, they portray Alexander as knowing that he was probably poisoned, though that is not a known fact.

Historical accuracy is on par with Xena Warrior<br/><br/>Princess (not an exaggeration!), but Xena has far more action, better character development.

No more, no less. When you don't see the eagle anymore, it doesn't mean the dreams of Alexander vanished, no, it means only Zeus abandoned his child - mythologically speaking - because he went too far.

","I honestly believe that this movie could have been one of the best movies ever. Colin Farrell's performance, in my opinion, was great, however, the movie itself was pretty bad. Time frequently jumps forward, skipping many parts that many probably are expecting to see. By the time the movie really gets started Alexander already has conquered most of the world. We abruptly skip from him being merely Phillip's son, to the ruler of most of the known world. We don't see the conquering of Egypt, marching his troops across the Sahara, any of that. We don't see his rise to power, and whenever great parts of history are skipped, a map appears and tells you what Alexander has conquered. In a story about conquering the world, its amazing there was only two battle scenes. The scenes themselves were very nicely done, except for some weird camera-work, but gave you no sense of what's going on. Basically, sheer chaos followed by a declaration of victory.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has somehow managed to screw up one of the greatest stories of all time. He somehow managed to turn one of the greatest men in history, the conquerer of worlds, into a flaming homosexual clown. There were good parts, way to few and far between, with homosexual filler and eccentric conversations filling in the vast amounts of time in between.<br/><br/>Believe me, skip this movie.

","if Alexander was from the Mediterranean(sp.?), why was he blond? And why did all of the warlords have anglo features? Although I am a minority, I am not one to play the race card with movies if it is a great film. And although 'Alexander' wasn't awful, Stone could have done so much more with the movie and his casting choices. <br/><br/>In his casting he is basically perpetuating what many have asserted for years: that Anglos play the role of conquerer, hero, liberator, educator, etc. to ""barbaric"", dark-skinned people. Couldn't Stone have chosen a cast more representative of the region (more people of color)?<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins (Ptoloemy) was under-utilized in his role as narrator. He starts out with some gibberish (mumbling) monologue about Alexander which draws my attention away from the story and onto the fact that I'm listening to a bumbling old man. Instead of using visuals (maps) to set a scene, Hopkins should have guided us to each place. Lastly, young Ptoloemy(sp.?) said almost nothing and was nothing more of than a yes man. But all of a sudden he's capable of being pharaoh of Egypt and a man of letters? I can't reconcile that.<br/><br/>The love scene between Farrell and Rosario Dawson. WHAT.WAS.THAT? Gratuitous is the only word I can think of. I hope Ms. Dawson will be more careful in her choices of nudity as part of storytelling. I was embarrassed for her. Stone basically pulled an old Hollywood trick out of his bag showing a non-compliant woman become automatically submissive to a man trying to take her body by force. This is 2004. Stone spent three hours telling the story; couldn't he have woven her initial resistance to Alexander's advances with an eventual copulation instead of showing us an attempted rape that turns into lovemaking? Love scenes usually don't bother me, but I have a daughter to whom I'm trying to teach self-efficacy. How do I explain that one of the world's greatest men, who was able to persuade millions to follow him not by force but by intellect, had to force himself upon his women?<br/><br/>Some of the visuals, while definitely different than your run of the mill epic, were terribly misplaced. Stone would show you horse hooves to convey what? How fast the horse was running? We know he's running fast; pan from the trotting to the battlefield or something that advances the story. Many shots were useless in the big scheme of things.<br/><br/>I have never worked on a movie nor am I a paid critic. However, I do know a good movie when I see one and this ain't it. Colin Ferrell, given the right movie, can definitely act and he did an excellent job. But just because he's an 'It Boy' doesn't mean he should be given an epic before he's paid his dues (See Russell Crowe in ""The Insider"" BEFORE ""Gladiator""). Angelina Jolie was very good, but I'd love to see her in a movie without an accent. Val Kilmer didn't inspire any hatred or love; his character, as it was cast, was a throwaway character, yet very essential to Alexander's background. Maybe Alec Baldwin or Mel Gibson instead?<br/><br/>SEE THE MOVIE FOR YOURSELF. I may be criticizing the film, but I respect that fact that everyone has their own perception of what makes a good movie."

","I understand why Alexander got bad reviews from the press. Stone had a really difficult task of making a ""historicaly correct"" film, and was too focused on Alexander's ordeals. If he had spiced-up the movie a little bit, like having more action sequences and suspense-filled scenes (plus a little less of his sexual escapades), it would have garnered good reviews. He should have learned from past films like the Liz Taylor starrer ""Cleopatra"", which received poor reviews too. I liked the film, but Stone should have done something that should have tickled the senses of the movie fans. Some of my friends told me that the movie was boring, and left the movie house halfway through the movie. They told me it is nothing near ""Gladiator"", which they truly loved."

","Spoilers. I am a fan of some of Oliver Stone's films. I think that they are generally hit-or-miss and this is a miss. When I think of Alexander the Great, I always ask the question 'What made him great?', and I don't think that question was ever answered. Was he a great leader, a great strategist, a great thinker, a visionary? What was his impact on the world? In the end I saw Alexander as a bi-sexual, world traveling, confused leader, who was a product of a dysfunctional parents. I think that Oliver Stone's approach to film making is to take a subject, spin it into an odd direction, and add something controversial for shock value. This is especially true in his movies that deal with historical figures. Too much time was spent on his bi-sexuality. I don't think that it was that important and I think it was done for shock value and box office draw. Alexander spent more time lounging around watching exotic dancers than he did conquering cities. Stone also seems to have a fascination with ghosts from people's past. He also has a penchant for conspiracy theories  'We killed him. No, write that he died of a fever'. In the end this is a very average movie."
"BraveSrROb","6","0","2","28 November 2004"," Stone aims for the low of Troy and does slightly better than that.
","Warning: Spoilers Below<br/><br/>Time for a public service announcement: Do not go see Alexander. I thought it was a 6/10 good, but I was the only one who even remotely the 170 minute epic. Therefore, allow me to tell you what most people will see in Alexander who don't love history (not like, love). <br/><br/>Memories from Alexander.<br/><br/>The movie begins with severely balding Anthony Hopkins addressing scantily dressed male slaves. Get used to the male skin, cause you're going to get to see a lot of it in this movie. There are points when you will honestly question whether you just wandered into a sado-masochist, gay porn shop.<br/><br/>After Hopkins rambles for approximately 150 minutes (give or take), we are treated to a wonderful cut to Angelina Jolie in bed with a young Alexander. This is a crucial scene in the movie because we are introduced to Alexander's mother, the snake fondler. Honestly, Jolie's only purpose is to walk around in Greek formal wear, apparently in a very air conditioned room, and fondle her snakes. She fondles boa constrictors, albinos, one snake, two snake, red snake, blue snake, and Green Eggs and Ham.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for those who practice bestiality with snakes, this scene comes to an abrupt end when Val Kilmer, King Philip, bursts in and begins an unsuccessful attempt to rape his wife. Jolie continues to act in a very cold room (or she enjoyed the rough foreplay).<br/><br/>Boring stuff happens for an ungodly long time then Alexander is king and attacking Babylon. This leads to an epic battle, set to the music from Blade Runner, between the Greeks and the Replicants. HAHA, just kidding. Seriously though, it's between the camera and dust, a battle in which dust is ultimately victorious as we don't see jack for most of this fight scene (Think of the battle at the end of Gangs of New York. Now, think of there being 290,000 people in a much heavier cloud of dust. Now, imagine having a constant nervous twitch where you are unable to focus on anything. Now, think of being blind. There, you've got the Alexander battle).<br/><br/>After the battle, Alexander kills one of his wounded soldiers. Alexander goes to Babylon and has sex with his male lover. Does this a lot apparently. Continues to be really boring. Alexander talks a lot about killing many more people.<br/><br/>Alexander ends up with his army in the Hindu-Kush and uses the opportunity presented by the plethora of beautiful women to film a lengthy topless scene with Rosario Dawson. She is truly and all-time great actress. She is in Alexander's bed for a good 20 minutes with her shirt off and never seems cold despite the obviously cool temperatures in the room. However, she's spared too much more time nude because Oliver Stone decided to save time and splice a scene in DIRECTLY FROM TROY!!!! Great idea! Let's put a crappy scene in from a crappy movie. That way, we'll make a good movie.<br/><br/>Alexander does more boring stuff. Then the movie shows us a guy on guy kiss, male genitalia (Mr. Goodwrench) and a fat, ugly, old woman's breasts. It was as if Oliver Stone were saying ""I'm too old to sustain an erection so I'll make sure no one in my audience will have one for the next 50 years.""<br/><br/>After completely ruining all good will men in the audience had for the movie, Stone decided it was time for a jungle battle. Stealing shots from Jurrassic Park, Stone makes sure that you realize that elephants are coming in through the woods. However, people around me were speculating what else it could be. Adam suggested a Tiger Tank, I suggested a T-Rex. But then Adam had a moment of great insight: it was a T-Rex driving a Tiger Tank. Unfortunately, the T-Rex could not fire the guns because his arms are too short.<br/><br/>Anyways, a battle that is even worse than the first takes place in which Alexander gets hit with an arrow laced with LSD. The screen goes psychedelic with red and dark colors and fighting all the while. Then the screen goes black and the movie ends.<br/><br/>Just kidding kiddies. We've still got another 30 minutes of film left! Alexander leads his army back to Babylon where his male lover dies.This is actually the funniest scene in the whole movie because Alexander's making a speech to the guy out an open window while you watch him writhe on the bed and die over his shoulder. Alexander being oblivious the whole time. He turns around and is shocked to see his favorite piece of ass stone-cold in the bed.<br/><br/>Well, Alexander handles this the only way one can. He gets a huge goblet of wine and drinks it all. He takes two steps and then falls down dead.<br/><br/>Just kidding, we've still got a 5 minute death sequence to go through. Then Alexander dies. Then they show his mother's reaction. Then they show the generals' reactions. Then they show Anthony Hopkins 40 years later. Then he talks some more. Then and only then, does the movie finally end.<br/><br/>On a scale from Troy to Braveheart, this is about a Patriot."

"chuckles77","1","0","4","28 November 2004"," A potential epic misses the mark
","Unlike the previous reviewer, I was really looking forward to seeing ""Alexander"". Hoping that it was in the vein of ""Gladiator"", I settled in for what I hoped to be a three-hour tale of epic proportions. The story of Alexander is, after all, a subject that continues to amaze scholars and historians to this day.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed about twenty minutes into the film (or perhaps shorter). You know that a film is in trouble when you unconsciously find yourself checking your watch every ten minutes to see how much longer you have to watch this morass.<br/><br/>There are so many deficiencies in this film that it's difficult to know where to begin. For one thing, the accents border on the absurd and are extremely distracting. As others have noted, Angelina Jolie sounds like the Russian spy Natasha on ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"". You half-expect her to blurt out ""moose and squirrel"" during one of her scenes. Val Kilmer fares only a little better.<br/><br/>Another deficiency (as well as being perhaps the most controversial topic) is the issue of Alexander's homosexuality. Suffice it to say, the historical evidence is equivocal. While we are aware of the existence of same-sex relationships that were sexual in nature in the ancient Greek culture, we have no direct evidence that Alexander himself engaged in such relationships. Yet Oliver Stone chose to make this issue a centerpiece of his film, based upon only the most tenuous circumstantial evidence.<br/><br/>If Stone truly wanted to portray homosexuality as it existed in Greek culture, he would have shown the relationships that existed between men and boys (pederasty) which was common in that era. While showing an older man pursuing a younger, immature Alexander in a sexual way may not have sat well with audiences, it would have given a more accurate picture of the sexual mores of the day. Stone's ""political incorrectness"" is much more of an historical anachronism, than being an accurate portrayal of 4th Century B.C. Greece.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the film, though, was the whole pace and development of its story. Throughout the three hours we are constantly told about how great Alexander was/is/will be. Yet the film never shows us WHY Alexander ought to be considered ""great"". We're only shown two battles, one of which he loses. The film glosses over much of his campaigns, and the viewer never really gets a true sense of his achievements. Stone chooses to spend vast amounts of time on monologues telling us about how great Alexander is, at the expense of never SHOWING us his greatness. As a result, the film fails to prove that which it claims.<br/><br/>If you want to watch an excellent historical epic piece, go watch ""Gladiator"" again. At least in that movie you knew why people were willing to follow its title character.<br/><br/>Movie Rating: 1 Star (Stinker)"

Everyone is complaining about all of the ""gay"" scenes but what they need to understand is that during this time there was no gay and straight... most everyone was bisexual. From this standpoint this movie was great. It showed that its O.K. for two men to love and care about each other in the same way that a man and a woman do. Just because Oliver Stone had the nerve to show this makes this movie well worth it and maybe it will be able to teach this country that if homosexuality was accepted in the far more intelligent cultures of ancient Greece and Rome then maybe just maybe it can be accepted here."
"Zhanger","1","0","3","28 November 2004"," Oliver Stone has failed.
","Upon hearing Oliver Stone was the director of this movie when it was still in production, I immediately thought he was out of his league. And after seeing it, it is true.<br/><br/>This is not a movie about one of the world's greatest generals who happened to be gay. This was a gay love story about a guy who happened to fight a battle once in a while. Three hours of movie, and Oliver Stone decides to show 2 choppy battle scenes and about 10 gay scenes or references. With all the resources at Oliver Stone's disposal, he presents Alexander's historical greatness not with battlefield exploits but with lengthy and boring narratives by Anthony Hopkins' character. I can listen to a history professor speak about Alexander's life and get as much imaginative imagery as I did with this movie.<br/><br/>It is clear Oliver Stone has no idea what he is doing when he shoots the 2 battle scenes, as he incorporates no overall battle strategy during the scenes but instead portrays a confusing mess of dust clouds concealing the action and a series of 1 second one-on-one fights between the soldiers. So great is Oliver Stone's obsession with Alexander's supposed homosexuality, that he seems to include these battle scenes half-heartedly as an afterthought. Gladiator or Troy, this is not.<br/><br/>It is not enough for Stone to suggest Alexander's possible homosexuality. Stone believes he must reinforce it again and again and again in nearly every scene so that homosexuality is the story, not one man's swift conquering of the known world. Pretty sad since Alexander's conquests are accepted historical events while the possible homosexuality is speculation that was written hundreds of years after Alexander's time. Stone hijacks the story of Alexander to stir up the controversy he craves, the same as he did with JFK.<br/><br/>So in the end, Oliver Stone presents nothing compelling in this movie. He tries to draw his audience in by making them believe it is an epic war movie only to swindle them by shoving his political agenda down their throats. The greatness of Alexander, according to Oliver Stone, is his gayness. This movie in a word: Pathetic."

The heavy-handed pseudoartistic symbolism (eagles? snakes? rings with big ugly stones in them?) failed to convey anything important, and the movie -- while giving us considerable insight into Alexander's angsty relationships with his dysfunctional family -- failed to show us the considerable military skill and personal magnetism that the real Alexander must have had in order for his conquests to be successful.<br/><br/>Ptolemy's endless narrations didn't work well, either. Not only were they boring, they also confused me. It seemed as though the Alexander that Ptolemy was describing had no resemblance to the one we were seeing on-screen.

My main problem with this movie was the manner in which it highlighted Alexander's bisexuality. OK, fine, Alexander liked guys. Say it, show it, move on. But at least 150 minutes of this film are devoted to Colin looking wistfully at some guy. We get it already!! And when he's not looking, he and his friend go into some 20 minute speech of clichéd romance lines. It's as though Oliver Stone spent most of the movie trying to convince me Alexander went both ways. If there was any faith in the acting ability of anyone involved (and I'm starting to have my doubts about Colin), he could have done this in five minutes. In my own opinion, Alexander was probably like most other wealthy, powerful Greeks at the time and would have been involved in some form of homosexuality. But honestly who cares? Alexander's sex life is not what made him important or noteworthy, even if he was bisexual or whatever else. What makes him stand out is the fact that he CONQUERED THE WHOLE FREAKING WORLD!! I would bet that most of us have messed up families and confusing/dramatic sexual experiences, but how many of us have done anything remotely approaching great?

It shows promise with all the elements described in the above paragraph, but then it looses it in actuality. Firstly, the story telling style was too random. They jump around history (myth?) so much that it gave me a headache. Secondly, the story this movie tells could be told in 90 minutes. It drags on. The first time in my life I wanted to walk out of the theater. It was a drag. Another thing was the editing. It was bad. The scenes were put together in a weird order. The moments of love were stretched too long, and some of the characters were given a lot of screen time, but no significance. Some elements of significance were not explained, just shown hastily. The music in the war scenes was more distracting than energizing. <br/><br/>The good thing about the movie was how it came around in the end to refer to earlier elements. You'll notice that in the movie. Anthony Hopkin's narration was fine, but his genius was wasted in the role.<br/><br/>overall, this was a feeble attempt at making an epic. Troy was a better movie by far.

Besides, I don't want a story getting in the way of the vision.<br/><br/>The battles--especially in India--are better than what we've seen this year; more confusion than 'Troy', but without the energy that Ridley brought to 'Gladiator.'

This is brushed up upon in this film, making it seem more as if Alexander is just homosexual. I am not a fan of everyone speaking English in a foreign setting in a movie, nor am I a fan of them using their own accents(Irish!!) when they are speaking English. They talked about being MILES away from home, as if they actually used the English Standard system in 323 B.C., not in England by the way. The acting is mediocre at best, the story focuses on the wrong parts, and the cinematography is bleak. So what was redeeming about it you say? It is unique, in that you just expect another uplifting Braveheart type movie. That's about it. I would say go see it and comment on it as well, because there are people who like movies for being unique, if that's you, go see it.<br/><br/>But in my opinion, just because something is unique does not make it good."

I went with a friend of mine who is as deep a critic as I am and we drew these conclusions:<br/><br/>One: The movie was good despite the VERY prevalent homosexual undertones. Throughout its 3 hour entirety of the movie we got one gay glance and smile after another, finally followed up by the Great Alexander Kissing an Indian Male Belly Dancer.<br/><br/>Two: They had Braveheart worthy material to work with but they botched it with making the movie almost all about his Homosexuality. If they would have focused on Alexander's trials and tribulations more than his affection for the young boys it could have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>Three: We were disgruntled because there was a small appearance by Aristotle. ARI-FREEKING-STOTLE! The greatest mind of ancient Greece, and what words of wisdom do we get from this man whose mind has influenced generations of people in science, literature, the performing arts and more? We get a 2 minute conversation about homosexuality. If we have Aristotle in a movie I want him to say something profound, not something to foreword the director's agenda (by the way I think this was Oliver stone's way of coming out).<br/><br/>Four: Wrong battles. The battles featured were shown accurately, but they just showed the wrong ones. Walking around the Indian Jungles and into Mountains of snow is not near as exciting as the Siege of Athens and Sparta would have been. <br/><br/>Five: Saving grace is the Music... if anything was Braveheart caliber it was the music.

","A lot of people including myself saw previews of this movie and thought Oscars immediately, until i saw the movie itself. You see great previews with amazing sets and the potential of a great film but it falls short. The acting was good, but not excellent. The costumes and scenery were excellent though, and truly made you believe you were next to Alexander in his world. The major problem though was plot. It concentrated too much on Alexanders passion for men, and not his conquering nature. It had only 2 battles in the whole movie, each about 20 minutes, which I felt was not enough when telling the story of the greatest conqueror of all time. It lost my attention and just wasn't interesting enough for the epic it could of been. If you appreciate scenery and costumes, then see Alexander, otherwise wait until video. Too bad too, with all those actors and Oliver Stone at the helm you would think great movie for sure, but just wasn't that way.

Everything in Phillipo death was real, until the 'kissing' like a gay ritual, beside the killer, according to the ancient source Diodorus, 'Philip was hosting a massive banquet as a going away party before he left for Asia. Leading the procession into the theater on the second day, were thirteen statues, twelve of the Olympian gods and one of Philip. Philip wanted his march into the theater to be triumphant, and so he asked his bodyguards to stand back and out of the way to show to his people that he had nothing to fear. At that very moment, however, a man named Pausanias rushed forward from the crowd and stuck a dagger in Philip's chest. During his escape, Pausanias tripped and fell and was killed on the spot' So, Olive Stone had every thing right, but he need to add the man to man kiss, (maybe is Stone inner expression again) The best scene is Alexander on his horse Bucephalus (ox head in Greek) against the Indian Elephant, but again no lance hit Alexander in that battle.

"cubdom","1","0","1","27 November 2004"," So many inaccuracies, so little time
","1. The blond hair. Portraying Hellenic peoples with blond hair was an invention of northern Europeans who wanted to find a way to associate themselves with the greatness that was ancient Greece. Hellenes were and are a Mediterranean people. As science classes have taught us, the skin and hair color of people around the world was determined by the land and climate in which people evolved. If we are to believe what we have been taught, sun and a dry climate mean dark skin and hair.<br/><br/>2. The homosexuality issue. I think the greatest amount of confusion regarding this issue arises due to the lack of proper translation of Ancient Greek texts. The mistakes in translation result in the misunderstanding of the semantic differences between such concepts as ""agape"" & ""philia"". What modern scholars have translated as ""love"" does not necessarily connote ""sexual desire"" as many today conclude.<br/><br/>3. The phalanx is portrayed all wrong. Starting with the front row of the phalanx, which held its spears parallel to the ground, each of the following rows held their spears at an increasing angle from the ground -- not straight up as they are portrayed in the movie.<br/><br/>4. Alexander did not sustain the wound that caused him to want to return home in the battle portrayed in the movie. The battle portrayed in the movie in which Alexander came face-to-face with the Indian Rajah on the elephant was won by Alexander. Historians write that Alexander had a similar conversation with this rajah as he had with the Persian princess Stateira, as portrayed in the movie. Asked how he would want to be treated, the rajah replied, ""as a king.""<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie was hardly the historical epic I expected it to be. It seemed more like left-wing Hollywood propaganda than anything else. I guess I was most disappointed by the fact that a man with the skill, fortitude, and ability to conquer the known world between the ages of 25 and 32 was portrayed as a whiner who, although educated by the greatest teacher known at that time, found himself questioning his beliefs and desires too often.<br/><br/>Instead of focusing on sexual innuendo, the film could have and should have focused on such issues as the reason for Alexander's desire to defeat the Persians, his countless battles, the good that he did (educating the people he defeated) along with the bad (sieges resulting in the massacre of thousands). Instead of showing inane conversations with Hephaestion, Alexander could have been shown visiting the oracle at Siwa where his ego became inflated upon being told that he was the son of Zeus/Ammon. The Battle of Issus and the Siege of Tyre would have made for fantastic cinema. Instead we were left with Ptolemy narrating such events, only so Olly Stone could focus, once again, on giving us a watered-down version of history.<br/><br/>The evolution of Alexander as a person was nowhere near being completely explored, and that fact is this movie's undoing."

","I'm a big fan of Stone and loved his Nixon. But after seeing Alexander I am wondering if he is still stuck on the same character study: Boy has issues with his demanding mother, feels inadequate, especially next to a more worthy son. After a short exile (or threat of exile), he returns to glory. His great vision of exporting democracy all over the world becomes more distorted and clouded as he exhausts the resources and goodwill of those around him. He becomes increasingly paranoid.<br/><br/>Stone's postmodern quote of Citizen Kane in Nixon, becomes his post-post modern quote of himself in Alexander. And, to some degree, the story is a parable and a warning about the disastrously blind and insulated leadership style of the current President Bush, marching into Persia to cheers and rose petals not realizing that he would become the benevolent but hated occupier that he is today. Stone seems to be warning us not to pursue this warped vision that has lead so many ambitious world leaders to their disastrous end. Little allusions to Saddam Hussein (Darius), the fact that it was supposed to be Jeb and not George W. that ascended to the White House help to punctuate this metaphor.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed the art direction, the choreography of the battle scenes, and the actors who were all dealing with a script and a concept difficult to pull off. I'm not sure what Stone was doing with the brogue, and I'm sorry our society is so homophobic that he couldn't delve deeper into Alexander's relationship with Hephaistion."

","Long, opulent, frustrating and ultimately mediocre take on one of the most mysterious and interesting individuals who ever walked the Earth. The titled character (portrayed as a man by Colin Farrell) became the ruler of Macedonia as a young adult and went on to conquer Persia and advanced to India before dying supposedly of fever just prior to his 33rd birthday. The events of the film are dictated by Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) some 40 years after Alexander's untimely death and thus we have flashbacks galore. For the most part the movie jumps approximately eight years forward at a time, showing its primary character at the age of 3, then 11, then 19, etc. Ptolemy as a younger man (portrayed quietly by Elliot Cowan) was actually one of Alexander's military commanders and thus he should have great insight into his former ruler. However, Cowan makes such a small impression that he pretty much gets lost in the chaotic shuffle. Ditto for gay love interest Jared Leto whose part could have been eliminated all together in my opinion. The sexual undertones are a wasted distraction that finally lead nowhere in terms of helping us understand Alexander better. The women seem totally lost in this venture as Angelina Jolie's disillusioned and crazed Olympias comes out looking more like a silly caricature than a historical enigma. Rosario Dawson is also on hand as a wife that Alexander has Luke-warm feelings for. Dawson, who has never proved she has any talent on the screen, generates no intensity either (even when she and Farrell engage in a rough sexual interlude). Val Kilmer shines in an uneven part as King Philip (Alexander's father, who supposedly impregnated Olympias by raping her) and his relationship with Farrell is up and down the whole way. At times they seem like they love each other and then they turn on one another like upset cobras thrown together in a glass box. ""Alexander"" is an intensely fascinating production. Co-writer/director Oliver Stone (doing his first mainstream work since the grid-iron dud ""Any Given Sunday"") reaches to the outer limits here and sadly comes up empty. The style of this picture is unlike anything from any other Stone-directed film. In many ways spectacle outshines everything else as art direction, costume design, cinematography and even the editing are right on target. Vangelis' (best known for scoring ""Chariots of Fire"") soundtrack is out of this world. As bad as this movie is, I was still mesmerized by its beautiful sound. The screenplay is a stylized train-wreck that combines myth, history and many personal assumptions (the film questions the way Alexander died ala Stone's conspiracy theories in the far superior ""JFK"") to create a pudding of nothingness. A talented cast has trouble with the way the movie is set up too as the dialogue feels forced, staged and at times unintentionally comical. With all this said, I wanted to like this film a lot more than I did by the finale. This was a monumental attempt that really did not pan out. To be fair to Stone, I am not sure any filmmaker could achieve success with this subject matter. If nothing else, ""Alexander"" makes me want to go back and study this part of world history. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

From the beginning until the first battle was tedious to sit through. The biggest theme had to have been the glorification of homosexuality in ancient cultures. I think the major problem with the film was that the actors were too estranged from the audience. I never felt any connection with any of them. Their speeches were awkward, extended run-on sentances that were delivered professionaly, but with shallow emotion. I don't blame the actors for this but the script.

The biggest disappointment about Alexander is that no one will ever attempt to make another epic movie about his life that is actually based in history. Oliver Stone simply used Alexander as his vehicle for putting forth a political statement about accepting other cultures at home and abroad.

","Peter Jackson must have stolen all the Epic mojo in all of Hollywood and put in his films, and you know if that's the case it was worth it. Oliver Stone has given us a depressed look at one of the world's greatest leaders and has missed a golden opportunity to make a great film. Great heroes are made though great accomplishments and suffering according to Greek myth yet in Alexander all Mr. Stone basically gives us is suffering. Alexander's greatest accomplishments were uniting Greece in his fight for the thrown, concurring Egypt, and the greatest prize defeating the Persian empire in numerous epic battles too become King of the known world, yet except for the battle at Gaugaumela these things are glossed over in this film. In Alexander the point was made greatness only comes from great suffering I believe this applies to tragic figures which Alexander was not. He died young, but he accomplished his one true goal before he did to become a god among men. So Mr. Stones attempt to make us feel pity for the man alone atop the world doesn't play for me. Alexander was a giant and lived like a god and with a great cast and budget I would think the pages of history would be easy to transfer to film but not in the case. If you really want to see a good story about Alexander watch the history channel and save 8 bucks."

","Rarely have I ever seen such a disjointed film. It alternates between florid and turgid, like Cecil B DeMille on a bad day. Its scale is vast, but lacks real grandeur. The two major battle scenes are confusing. In the first, the Battle of Gaugamela, there is a great shot showing the opening of the battle from an eagle's point of view, but this is the only shot which gives us any real sense of what is going on. Otherwise it's Macedonian hoplites and cavalry against Persians with the Persian king Darius deserting the field for no apparent reason (he has plenty of unused reserves and has clearly outflanked Alexander). <br/><br/>The second battle, against elephants in India, is merely confusing. And strange colors in part of the sequence -- red leaves on the trees -- doesn't help matters. Stone should sit down and watch some Kurosawa to see how to film a battle. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins, as Ptolomy, tries to let us know what is going on with narration. This is not entirely successful. For example, Alexander's conquest of Egypt is reduced to a couple sentences. There is also a flashback late in the film to the assassination of Alexander's father, Philip (Val Kilmer) It would have made more sense to have shown this in its proper place.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell, sporting the worst hair dye since Milla Jovovich in The Fifth Element, stumbles through his role as the sexually ambiguous, driven conqueror. His relationship with Hephaistion (Jared Leto with too much eye-liner) is curiously understated. The two men hug but never kiss and whether or not they go to bed together is only hinted at. There is a body servant of Alexander who seems spend much of his time just standing around, looking sloe-eyed.<br/><br/>Alexander marries, for no apparent reason, and against the advice of his generals, a woman named Roxana, with whom he has one night of passion and then promptly loses interest.<br/><br/>Alexander's relationship with his mother, played by Angelina Jolie, borders on the incestuous. She comes across as a combination of snake charmer, Lady Macbeth and stereotypical Jewish mother (she sends Alexander a letter that can be summed up as ""you never call, you never write, why don't you come home and marry a nice Greek girl""). Jolie is far too young to be playing the adult Alexander's mother and speaks with an accent that sounds like Natasha Fatale. Most of the other Greeks speak with Irish accents, except for Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Plummer and Brian Blessed who sound English.<br/><br/>Alexander keeps driving his troops onward for no apparent reason. Towards the end, some of them mutiny because they haven't seen their homes and families for over eight years. They are bogged down in an endless campaign in India. Alexander, in one of the worst speeches to the troops ever, can't give them a reason for not going home. So he just has the leaders of the mutiny killed and then gets into another battle in which he is nearly killed. Then he goes home, crossing a desert. A sequence which should have been reminiscent of Napoleon retreating from Moscow is reduced to one shot and a couple of lines of narration.<br/><br/>My basic problem with the film is that we never get any sense of why Alexander acted as he did. Farrell stumbles through his role, not giving us any real clues about the man himself. In any biography, we need to understand the main character. Apparently, neither Farrell nor Stone understand Alexander, so of course the audience doesn't understand him either. <br/><br/>One last comment: Alexander's death was such an homage (a kindlier word than ""rip-off"") to Citizen Kane that I expected him to say ""Rosebud""."

Don't go in there expecting a cookie-cutter Hollywood action film that's like all the other action films that were ever made, because that's not what you're going to get.

I have got to say, there is very little gay material in the movie, in proportion to what people are saying about it. I was half-expecting 10 nude homosexual scenes, after hearing all the hype, but it's just not true. It is tastefully alluded to in the film, and there's really not that much of it! There is a lot of the film to like that has nothing to do with bisexuality. (My husband and I saw it together and enjoyed it, and we are not gay.) So, let's all be adults and get over it. Let's face it, homosexuality and bisexuality have been going on ever since humans have been in existence, and that's not going to change now, just because some people are upset about seeing it in a movie.

"Antagonisten","4","0","1","26 November 2004"," Disappointing
","I caught this at the Stockholm International Film Festival of 2004. The theme of this year's festival was Oliver Stone and they showed several of his older (and better) films. Also there was an interview with Stone at the festival (although he was nowhere to be seen the day i watched this).<br/><br/>Alexander is the story of Alexander the Great who conquered large parts of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. His armies went as far from his native Greece (or Macedonia as the movie states) as to India in his quest for more land to conquer. During his short life (he died at 33) he became the ruler of most of the known world and spread the western culture to many lands.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is an interesting director in my opinion. In my eyes he has always been capable both of great film-making (Platoon, Wall Street) and utter garbage (Natural Born Killers, U-turn, Comandante). But it seems lately his track-record is beginning to lose it's shine since most of the utter garbage he's made is later in his career. Unfortunately this borders on garbage.<br/><br/>When i've read reviews here (and on other sites, not in papers since the movie is not released in Europe when i write this) i often see many references to the homosexual content in this film. Which i find surprising since that content feels more or less non-existent. Sure Alexander kisses a man and expresses affection for another, but it's not even clear whether this is proof he was bi-sexual. Anyway, the reason i bring it up is that i want to make clear it had nothing to do with my rating of this film.<br/><br/>So, what's wrong with Alexander? Well the script is the main thing. It feels to me like the script emphasized the wrong things. We never get to know Alexander, never get to crawl under his skin and know the man he was. Instead, every time he's on screen he's either weeping or making a speech. It's the same with all the characters, they come out as extremely shallow cardboard figures. Instead of developing the characters, Stone tries to make the narrator drive the story ahead. This could have worked in a more story-driven movie, but this movie is centered on Alexander as a person and a king, which makes this a problem.<br/><br/>Also, the editing is terrible in many ways. For instance, the first battle fought in the movie against the Persians ends very abruptly. Alexander attempts to beat the Persian king's army of 250.000 men (with his own army of 40.000) by killing the king himself, hoping that will stop his men from fighting. The attempt is failed and Alexander barely escapes with his life. Then suddenly the scene is cut, and the next scene shows Alexander marching into Babylon after his victory against the Persians... Editing like this, and the fact that the movie jumps 8 years forward and back a couple of times, doesn't really help the experience.<br/><br/>The acting is another thing. I think Colin Farrell did a very good job portraying Alexander. It's not his fault that the character felt shallow and uninteresting, he undoubtedly did his best. Angelina Jolie on the other hand was a catastrophe. She screamed and looked menacingly at everyone, and her Russian accent is completely misplaced and uncalled for. The accents were a chapter of their own. All of the Greeks spoke a kind of Scottish/Irish accent that there is no real explanation to.<br/><br/>So, in the end, what can i say to sum things up? Well, Alexander sure looks nice enough. The battle scenes (the few there are) look very nice and certainly more interesting and well done than in Troy for instance. But the movie feels like it doesn't know what i wants to be. It's too shallow for a biography of Alexander, it's too muddled and messy to be story-driven, and there is way too little action for it to be action-driven. The end result is very slow, rather uninteresting and forgettable. I rate it 4/10 and conclude that the thing that will probably stay with me longest after this experience is the music. Vangelis hardly ever disappoints."

","Let me first start by saying that visually the film was superb and utterly breathtaking. However, Oliver Stone should have put a bit more effort into his casting of the film. Rosario Dawson, although gorgeous, cannot act worth beans. The accents alone were horrendous. Some had Irish accents and others like Dawson's and Jolie's were hard to place. Word of the wise the movie should flow the audience shouldn't be able to detect the 21st century in the film. The length of the film could have and should have been trimmed down immensely. There were these scenes that were needlessly drawn out and bored the audience to pieces. Many of the lines and gestures used were almost humorous, such as the innuendo between Hephaistion and Alexander. And I believe it was the line ""except Hephaistion's thighs"" brought the film to a pitiful new low. Yes Alexander was obviously bisexual but to have playful flirting document their life-long affair is ridiculous. I have never in all my life seen so many people walk out of a film. I believe that this movie, just like Troy, had too much Hollywood fever surrounding it and that is just box- office suicide. The movie was almost too dramatized and too over the top. The history alone should have been enough to keep this movie afloat. If this was Colin Farrell's attempt to dig himself out of his B-move slump he has sadly failed."
"livewire-6","Null","0","1","25 November 2004"," Stone and Farrell, defeated by Hephaistion's thighs
","At the beginning of ""Alexander"", Ptolemy, Greek pharaoh of Egypt, tells us that ""Alexander was never defeated, except by Hephaistion's thighs"". (This line is no invention of Oliver Stone's, but a quote variously attributed to Cynic philosophers or a poet named Claudius Aelianus.)<br/><br/>Alas, what was true of Alexander the hero proves to be equally true of ""Alexander"" the film, as well as its director, Oliver Stone, and its lead actor, Colin Farrell. Sad to relate, all three fall on the same stumbling-block: their inability to deal squarely with the importance of Hephaistion in Alexander's life.<br/><br/>One wonders what on earth possessed Stone to tackle this project, and to cast Farrell in the title role. Never were two men more ill-suited to the task. Both are fatally hampered by their own swaggering machismo -- and the homophobia that lingers in Hollywood and America at large -- from being able to understand, appreciate and convey, with any verisimilitude, the physical passion and emotional connection that Alexander and Hephaistion must have felt.<br/><br/>Stone and Farrell never allow the two historic lovers to do more than give each other a bear hug or, at best, a back rub. There is no on-screen kiss, let alone any nudity or lovemaking.<br/><br/>In an early scene, we see Alexander and Hephaistion as 12-year-old boys, wrestling at the gymnasium, chastely clad in loincloths. This is patently inaccurate, since Greek men and boys wore nothing more than olive oil -- and perhaps a laurel wreath -- when they engaged in athletic activities, including the Olympic Games. But in America's current climate of anti-sexual hysteria, it would of course be quite impossible to show the historical reality.<br/><br/>This is only one of many anachronisms in the film. For instance, we are told the extent of Alexander's empire in square miles -- an English measure of area, where the Greeks might have used hectares instead. But worst of all, most intrusive and annoying, is the plethora of Irish brogues heard from the male cast, primarily Colin Farrell himself, the young actor who plays Alexander as a boy, and Val Kilmer as his father, Philip of Macedonia. I am tempted to believe that this casting was a deliberate decision, based on Farrell's inability to neutralize his own native accent.<br/><br/>Some scenes seemed derivative, echos of other celebrated films. At one point, we see the ground strewn with wounded men, and the camera dollies back for a wide-angle shot. I half expected to see Scarlett O'Hara in her straw bonnet and faded calico dress, and the tattered Confederate flag waving in the breeze.<br/><br/>The score by Vangelis also struck me as derivative. One bar in particular sounds strangely familiar -- I'm almost positive it was lifted from an opera aria.<br/><br/>The ancient Greeks had a saying that ""an army of lovers cannot fail"". Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" fails for precisely that reason: it does not allow Alexander and Hephaistion to be lovers, as they undoubtedly were in life and will always remain in history."
"inman50","1","0","1","25 November 2004"," Stultifyingly Bad
","I've already posted a lambasting of this travesty in the Oscar message board, which is somewhat (sic) of an irony. To all those who defend this rubbish heap of a film, I cannot fathom what you see in it. Stone may be impassioned with his subject matter, but he has no way of telling it in lucid dramatic terms, veering forward and backward in time like a drunken driver trying to navigate a stick shift for the first time. The only semblance of feeling in the film is engendered by the toned down love between Alexander and Hephaistion. Everything else is a narrative blur about Alexander's failed attempt to bring the East and West to some common ground of cultural harmony, and his frightful relationship with his mother and father, both played nonsensically by Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer, the former sporting a Russian spy/Jewish harpy accent and the latter a vague Irish brogue meant to duplicate (?) Colin Farrell's? But with a horrendous script that makes one titter with howlers like ""women are more dangerous than men"", no actor of any talent could escape infamy here. I suspect Stone hates women, reducing Rosario Dawson to a panting, painted vixen who can only stand on the sidelines while Farrell and Leto gaze longingly at each other. The film feels constantly off balance, interminable, and fails to create any empathy for its characters. Despite the panorama of the two battle scenes, they feel oddly detached, edited as madly as the rest of this colossal mess. Despite his penchant for excess, I expected much more from Oliver Stone, a roiling, accumulative emotional juggernaut that would make aesthetic caveats insignificant by the sheer weight of his visionary force. What we have here is a film that looks and feels like something fashioned by a committee of monkeys in the writing and editing rooms, a disaster of singular proportions. It not only makes ""Gladiator"" look even better than it really is, but it makes one long for the glory days of ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" even more fervently, let alone the sublime majesty of ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Has it become that difficult to tell an epic story anymore? Apparently it has for Mr. Stone. The film wanders as aimlessly as it's hero does from Macedonia to Babylon to India in his (according to Stone) attempt to extricate his mother, Olympias, from his interior self as much as the geographical divide. The folly is in trying to tell the story of Alexander in a 3 hour film, because in attempting to cram as well as delete, Stone has reduced myth to a frantic and discordant stew of imagery, full of eye-popping sets and shouting matches between Alexander's increasingly weary and disenchanted comrades that adds up to nothing. Stone is like a crazed general leading his troops into a battle they can only lose. It's hard to believe this is the same man who made ""Platoon"" 18 years ago. It's as if his once bridled egomania, serving him at times brilliantly in the past, has now given way to unbridled desperation."

"magicneedles","Null","0","1","25 November 2004"," Alexander the Not-so-Great
","I won't continue to belabor the overall inanity of the film, but the central issue to the failure of this film was the miscast primary character. I am a huge Colin Farrell fan, and I think he's been brilliant in some of his roles, but this simply isn't one of them.<br/><br/>The best contrast I can think of is Richard Burton in ""Anne of the Thousand Days."" Henry VIII is a similarly mythical and larger-than-life character, and it's difficult to picture Henry VIII in any way BUT as Burton, so well did he capture that character. Yet Burton himself was unable to captivate audiences as Alexander in the earlier film made about his life, and Farrell has fallen so short that I'm afraid his career may never recover.<br/><br/>Forget the megalomania and homoerotica. It's absolutely possible to have a flawed central character who is still charismatic, engaging, and sympathetic to the audience (think Gibson as William Wallace, Costner as DA Jim Garrison ... heck, Stone even managed to make Harrelson and Lewis almost likable in a sick way in Natural Born Killers). Stone very convincingly covered the flaws in Alexander's character as he saw them. What he forgot was to put in a few strengths that might make us give a rip what eventually happened to this man. Farrell's Alexander simply makes you wish fervently that one of his many depicted enemies would get on with it and just do him in. <br/><br/>In Braveheart, the English were unequivocally the ""bad guys"" and whether you agree with that in reality or not, within the movie there was no doubt who you wanted to win each battle. Same in Gladiator. Same in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, King Arthur, and many other moderately to insanely successful films which have included battle sequences. Here, you never start to care about Alexander personally, or about his battles globally, so you don't know who to root for in the battles and eventually side somewhat furtively with whoever he happens to be attempting to conquer. Who and what are Macedonians? Most people with a standard high-school history education would have trouble answering that question. And after seeing this film, the only answer would be, ""a bunch of drunk, bisexual, whiny traitors."" Go, Persians.<br/><br/>The difficulty in portraying a character like Alexander is similar, in my mind, to the difficulty in portraying a character like Julius Caesar or Cleopatra (or, for more modern interpretation, a Ghandi or a Roosevelt or a Monroe or a Kennedy). In order to make it work, the actor has to be able to capture the indescribable, magnetic quality that made the icon a person who drew people, sucked them in, made them believe fully and wholly that impossible dreams could be realized. People like that only come along a few times a century in reality, and they're usually busy or dead. Therefore you have a rather limited selection of normal actor-type people who are really nice to look at, but do not have that magnetic quality; and they're almost always going to fall short in trying to capture the uncapturable. I honestly can't think who, amongst the Hollywood selection at the present time, WOULD be captivating in a global role like this one.<br/><br/>The saddest thing about this film to me is that somehow Stone took one of the greatest heroes, armies and stories in the history of mankind, made an extremely expensive and long examination, and managed to have not one single heroic character in the film."

After being caught nearly off-guard by the Best Picture win of Gladiator at the Academy Awards in early 2001, major movie studios put the fast track on projects they once thought would never be made, including a large budgeted adaptation of the fall of Troy. Continuing with the subject matter of ancient historical figures and events, controversial filmmaker Oliver Stone, whose recent gushing documentary on communist dictator Fidel Castro received mixed reviews among critics and the public, has put his ten year plan of bringing the life of Alexander the Great to the big screen into action. He has had a lot to compete with in recent years including three others Alexander based projects developed just in the last few years  two of the most notable ones being the Martin Scorsese directed feature starring Leonardo DiCaprio and the ten episode HBO miniseries produced by Mel Gibson called Fire from Heaven. Leave it to Stone to continue making headlines, this time with rumors of the film's unconventional portrayal of the most influential figure in the history of Western Civilization  as a homosexual.<br/><br/>The story follows the eight years of constant warfare led against most of the known world by one man that would alter the course of Western Civilization forever. Born in July 356 B.C. (his exact date of birth has never been precisely determined) as son to Philip II of Macedonia and Olympias, Alexander was destined for greatness. After the assassination of his father, a plot many historians believe was conspired by Olympias, Alexander forced rebel barbarians in northern Macedonia out of the country and brought Greek city states such as Thebes and Athens under his control. Seeking revenge for the invasion of Greece in 490 B.C. by the Persian Empire, Alexander then set his sights east battling King Darius of Persia for control of the vast territory. After chasing King Darius for several years, Alexander arrived in Persepolis and discovered the dead body of the conquered ruler, apparently betrayed by his own men. Alexander enforced a blending of the Greek and Persian cultures instead of stripping each conquered nation of its cultural identity, which had been a staple of military conquest at the time of his invasion. This led to the spreading and vast acceptance of Greek culture throughout most of the known world, the most supreme and lasting influence Alexander's conquests had on the world. By the relatively young age of twenty-seven, Alexander the Great had conquered about ninety percent of the known world. Unsatisfied with simply conquering the Persian Empire, Alexander continued east into India but turned back home after one of the bloodiest battles his military campaign had yet encountered in their eight years of fighting. Despite being described as god-like figure, some say even a god himself, Alexander the Great met an inglorious demise, dying of a fever on June 10th, 323 B.C. The story for Alexander should be a shining example for future generations of intrepid writers on how not to pen an epic historical drama. In all honesty, Pearl Harbor's extravagantly clichéd storyline was far more engaging then this overblown snooze-fest. Granted this is an adaptation of some rather heavy-handed events in history that altered the course of civilization as we know it but the tone of the entire feature, including its less then important subject matters, can only be describe as being too austere to be taken with a straight face. The linguistic tone of the film's dialogue is so overblown as to be inadvertently laughable, a screen writing debacle that was obvious in another epic disaster earlier this year, Troy.<br/><br/>What is with Hollywood when it comes to making films about either the Greeks or the Romans? Does every actor and actress in these grand-scale epics have to have a British or Irish accent to them? Even Val Kilmer, who clearly isn't a native of the British Isles, has a slight accent to his voice! Other then that minor quip, Kilmer gives an engaging performance of a deeply trouble ruler. Philip II of Macedonia, the father of Alexander, is presented in the film as a disfigured drunkard and womanizer. Though he certainly overly relished in wine and women, there is no evidence to suggest that he was disfigured in anyway. If this is suppose to be a metaphorical device for interpreting his tortured soul or what have you then it should have been better explained through the language of the script as it is blatantly unclear to audiences. Olympias, Alexander's barbarian mother, played by Angelina Jolie, had a profound influence on the young ruler's life and should have had more screen time or more important sequences then what is presented in the film but this isn't of tremendous concern in the end. So little is given on the backgrounds of either one of Alexander's parents that the audience is often forced to interpret certain aspects of the film's story a certain way without any real knowledge as to whether it is correct or not. This isn't so big of a problem but it would have served the flow of the film better had Stone cleared those up a bit more then he did. Stone only alludes to a certain aspect of Alexander's strange life, this time his Oedipal attraction to his mother which greatly affected his sexual preferences throughout the rest of his life. Colin Farrell, despite his Irish accent intact throughout the film, really showcases his acting chops in this film, if anyone hadn't noticed already in Tigerland, Phone Booth, or Minority Report. Sporadically throughout the film director Oliver Stone alludes to Alexander the Great's supposedly homosexual preferences especially with his best friend Hephaestion, with whom it is well-documented the ruler had a close relationship with whatever that may be interpreted as. Unfortunately, despite the general acceptance by historians that Alexander had a preference for men, there has been no recorded evidence available to this point to suggest that the Macedonian ruler ever had a sexual encounter with any males of that time period, let alone his best friend Hephaestion. If those were more accepting times as Stone claims then there would be indication of so-called affairs but to date there has been no such discovery in any documents written about him. Whether you agree with the morality of homosexuality or not, one has to admit that Stone's faint allusions to Alexander's sexuality are cowardly at best, offensive at worst. Instead of making simple-minded, and blatantly obvious, allusions to Alexander's sexual antics why don't you just come out and admit to what the man was and not cower to the whim of certain fractions of the general public who may find the idea offensive. This is the simple case of put up or shut up and Stone seems to want to have it both ways, which doesn't bode well with anyone.<br/><br/>Overall, Alexander stays true to form of the romanticized image Hollywood has built up about the stylized epic dramas of Oliver Stone, that being that the film is excessively long, tedious, humorless, boundless in the realms of prodigal violence and loose sexual escapades, and its even looser interpretation of the facts of history. In essence, the basic make up of the modern Oscar nominee. Oliver Stone exemplifies in this film a severe problem that has succumbed a fellow socialist filmmaker, Michael Moore, specifically he likes to pick and choose through the piles of facts and theories those that are consistent with his particular line of thinking in order to force onto audiences his propagandist agenda. Yes, Stone did immortalize Alexander the Great as a child, he has stated this numerous times before, and nobody can really blame him for making a film that looks more favorably on his hero then actual history would suggest, but that does not give him a legitimate excuse to alter historical truths to his liking or give a ring of truth to inane conspiracy theories as he did with JFK. Can it be that hard to believe that Alexander, despite his spectacular accomplishments, was actually human and died of the flu or malaria? There is no evidence throughout known records to suggest that a conspiracy was led against Alexander, despite him being paranoid for a good portion of his life with the thought of such a thing, and poison actually being the cause of his death. Oliver Stone can believe whatever he wants but without any crucial evidence to back up his opinions and thoughts, he shouldn't be subjecting his audiences to hearsay and whatnot when that is far from the truth. Regardless of the fact that the film is about one of the greatest military strategists in history who had conquered most of the known world by the age of twenty-seven through countless bloody battles, only two engagements are ever focused on throughout the three-hour marathon, and even the facts of their interpretation have been arranged to the liking of the director, not historical relevance. Though several events depicted in the film are legitimate with historical records of that time, too often they are moved around to better suit the 'vision' of the filmmaker giving an extreme disadvantage to audiences in their understanding of the most influential figure in Western Civilization. Yes, there are certain moments in history that may not be as interesting as if someone jazzed it up a bit but this is supposed to be better? At least in school you had the school bell to look forward to liberating you from utter boredom, if you were that kind of person. Even if you were one of those individuals who got a kick out of reading up on history, you'll be wishing for that bell halfway through this deathtrap."

","I had hoped, despite the critics' words (which are often wrong concerning ""thinker"" movies, says I), that Alexander would not only be beautiful to look at, but also moving - at least sporadically (such as Troy; Peter O'Toole was marvelous, and Brad Pitt was sufficiently moving that at least I cared and felt bad when he died). But Alexander disappointed on almost every front (notable exceptions: spectacular cinematography, wondrous music).<br/><br/>THE CAST was adequate yet not noteworthy; Angelina Jolie was pretty to look at and had a mysterious accent (was that brito-Italian?) but simply didn't come across as anything but stuck on snakes and her son and destroying Philip (her husband). Val Kilmer was so crusty seemed like he was reading his lines from a teleprompter; didn't seem like a leader at all. Colin Ferrall just didn't seem too dramatic, although you do get to see another, lighter, side to his acting capabilities - some pleasantly jovial moments - but no hint or shadow of charisma was demonstrated; one is left to wonder, if Alexander was like THIS why didn't someone shoot, poison or castrate him when he was going through his whiny teenager stage? Anthony Hopkins looked as if his lines moved him, but simply didn't movingly deliver. Since these actors are all great, I can only suppose that the scriptwriters, directors and editors missed their mark; sort of like having all the ingredients for a perfect chocolate cake and coming out with a burnt brick.<br/><br/>THE CONTEXT, though beautiful to look at (the Babylon set/scenery was especially nice), simply seemed, well, stupid. The ""generals"" and other military leaders, who never seemed much to respect Al were frumpy - as if all thought Rosanne Barr was the role model for each of them. The homosexual liaison between Al and his best friend was simply overplayed (note: if such relationships were so common, why did NOBODY ELSE in the movie have one?). I think intimacy of friendship could've been portrayed more authentically and been more subtle on the points of whether their relationship was a ""friendship with benefits"" or not. And what was it with the gay dancers? (Again: if it was so common, why was Al the ONLY one who got his juices flowing?)<br/><br/>NOT MOVING - and that was truly sad. When Alexander died I was actually relieved because I could go home. I was brought near or actually to tears NOT AT ALL; coming from a crybaby (hey, I was even moved to tears a few times (not due to disappointment) during Star Wars Episode II). The story simply failed to deliver.<br/><br/>Can't say enough good about the beautiful sweeping vistas and Vangelis-typical perfect and moving music. The music did its best to move me despite the mediocre storytelling, but all it could do was at least give me something to smile about. I give the movie a solid 5 - not too bad, not too good; sort of like eating room-temperature oatmeal enjoyed while looking out a picture window with a great view and having some awesome music in the background.<br/><br/>PS Collin's brief full monty was just dumb; maybe they hoped some eye candy for the ladies of both sexes would make up for the potholes plaguing the flick."

","Colin weeps across 3 continents. Not for an instant does one get the idea of the brilliance and bold confidence the real Alexander must have had. The battle scenes start well and then turn into MTV-style shaky colors confusing what is happening. There is not a good performance in the film. Philip, Alexander's father, was a brilliant general and king who built up Macedonia to a world power...but the movie shows him as a full time drunk. But wherever we go and whatever he does, Alexander finds occasion to...not exult in his victories, not glory in battle...but weep, and weep some more, and then some more. This is so boring...Troy was a masterpiece compared to this drivel and the actors in that film, like Brad Pitt or not, were excellent in their roles. And oh for a Peter O'Toole as Lawrence or Heston as El Cid or Gibson as Braveheart. Picture any of them weeping throughout their conquests and you get the idea of how horribly hilariously bad this piece of garbage was. (And, except for Natural Born Killers, I normally like Oliver Stone movies.)"
"honorius7","Null","0","1","24 November 2004"," What a disappointment. What was the point?
","I found Stone's Alexander to be a real disappointment. It was just so sadly... mediocre.<br/><br/>Specifics: first, the acting generally rated an average. Jolie and<br/><br/>Kilmer were entertaining compared to the rest of the overacting cast.<br/><br/>Second, the cinematography was inconsistent. Crystal clear, grainy; different exposures of light and color; slow motions and fast editing; all of these were used, but for no apparent purpose to further the story line.<br/><br/>Third, having read the biography of Alexander by the film's historical consultant I was prepared to recognize specific events in Alexander's life. I wasn't prepared for the many events skipped over, the obvious dramatic inserts, and the lack of purpose this story was not building up to.<br/><br/>Fourth, as much as I have liked Vangelis's work in the past, his music in Alexander just didn't do it. It was a wrong fit. Vangelis's music so often, for me, communicates the ethereal and cosmic. Here it added to the overacting, almost campy feel of much of the movie. (Just a note- I heard a riff from the Moroder Metropolis.)<br/><br/>Fifth, the homosexual aspect of Alexander's bisexuality seemed... strangely? half-hearted? portrayed. This is the kind of treatment of a highly politicized topic that rile both extremes.<br/><br/>To summarize, comparisons to cheesy sword and sandal flics of the<br/><br/>past are warranted here. When you get to the middle of the movie and are becoming impatient that the main character hasn't died yet, I think there's a problem."
"sam_perera","7","0","1","24 November 2004"," Too long and dull...
","Oliver Stone makes great movies. This isn't one of his best. It isn't as awful as some reviewers suggest but rather long in the story telling and acting. I had to endure the almost 3 hours of this epic and it did not make me feel the impulse to yawn or doze off and yet it did not hold you to the seat either. The lead choice was very poor as Colin Farrell was in no way look or act like a great General that subdued Persia and Western Asia. And who chose those kid actors? Ugh! The first 20 minutes were so excruciatingly detailed (about Alexander's history etc), you almost got lost if you did not listen intently to a very old and horrid Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy. It seemed like a Greek history lesson and if you concentrated on the popcorn, you would surely have failed the test afterwards. And why doesn't Angelina Jolie ever age in this movie as her son does? The battle scenes were masterful and the cinematography of the magnificent locations stunning. With all the fuss about the homosexuality traits of Alexander depicted on the movie, the actual footage was strong but without graphical content. The only graphical love scene was the heterosexual element between Alexander and Roxane. Definitely worth seeing but in no way Oscar worthy."
"panlask","4","0","1","24 November 2004"," Nationality issues vs. ex Eastern block
","To end this once and for all (well, for anyone who reads this anyway). Alexander the Great was a MACEDON. That does NOT mean he was not Greek. Greeks were actually multiple of factions (Minoans, Corinthians.... and of course Macedons) spreading from Black Sea to Crete. Those populace shrinked through the years and especially after Byzantine fall were pushed within the current boundaries of Greece. All Macedonian inscriptions are in Greek. Relevant tombs are in Greece. Even countries conquered by Alexander have dirham for currency (remember ancient Greek drachma?).<br/><br/>The fact that Tito (Eastern Block, Communist president, ex Yugoslavia, around 60s) decided to name the southern province of his country after Macedonia, in order to put a future territorial claim and gain access to Aegean Sea, does not, can not and will not make Alexander the Great of Serbian origin.<br/><br/>Of course it is hard to convince the handful of people in Skopje who were brought up from school learning such things.

Was this written with one of those ""Script Writing for Dummies"" books? The pacing was very slow. The battle scenes had a few decent moments but as far as I know Macedonian Phalanges were not static but dynamic formations. They rolled around the battlefield doing most of their damage with shock from colliding with the enemy. The second battle was cut together like a strobe light that seemed to dazzle the eyes physically but little else. The last battle scene goes red for a while, it screams Film school hack job. All I can say is that I wish I had spent my youth with Alexander so that I could have strangled him to save us from this movie. No, that's unfair, where does Oliver Stone live?"

That line would have been welcome, because this thing hovered on pathetic. I don't quite understand the myriad of accents and there should have been some consistency there--quite irritating. Alexander came off as a bit of a fop and whether true or not, not a very appealing character and played awfully badly by Farrell, who I'm still trying to grasp the appeal of as he looks like he smells to high heaven.

There is also some homosexual/bisexual plot, but nothing too extreme.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a precise, accurate historical account of the time period of Alexander the Great, then this is not the best film to see.

","First, I have not seen Alexander yet, so I won't comment on the film. There was a book written some 20years ago called 'The Persian Boy' about a Enoch in the personal service of Alexander attending to all his needs, sexual and otherwise. I wonder whether that would have been a better approach to tell the story of Alexander without necessarily getting into to much of the sexual side. He was most certainly bi-sexual but that does diminish his achievements. Sexuality in the ancient world was not as categorized as it is today.<br/><br/>One thing I have noticed with many of the recent epics filled with battle scenes is that the camera is whizzing about like a Looney on a spring!

With much better acting especially from Jolie as Alexander's mother, I was surprised how good this film was after reading the negative reviews. Perhaps some people are just homophobic and hated the movie because of Alexander's sexuality. It was that bad. It was the best film ever. I's a war drama with great fight scenes and acting. I found the acting inspirational and only showed the talent each of the actors/ actress's carried.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that this is now one of my most favorite films ever seen."

","This movie reflects everything that Oliver Stone believes in....himself! <br/><br/>This movie is visually stunning but is totally lacking in any character development and is peppered with meaningless bi-sexual crap not having anything to do with the man himself. <br/><br/>Stone is notorious for giving us his opinion of history given his power as a movie director. He tries to create history in the way he believes it happened, or, should be told. <br/><br/>If you want to see history watch The History Channel. If you want eye candy, lies and innuendo watch Alexander."

","Greetings,<br/><br/>I have read read a few reviews written by ""wanna be reviewers"" however, if you go to the rotten tomatoes web-site there are two professional reviews written, which are both very positive.<br/><br/>People, Oliver Stone is an intelligent man and from the professional critics it appears he made an intelligent movie, with thought needed to understand the material.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to see the movie--one review stated that Jolie's performance was bombastic and so was the real olympias, if anyone reads her history? And someone remarked that the battle in the desert was hard to see, only oliver stone would make it realistic.......<br/><br/>cioa for now"

","I saw this movie sneak preview at my school. not only does it lack good cinematic elements, but it drags out these moments. Furthermore, Stone exploits the life of a major historical figure and uses him to support his own political agenda. If you are looking for a movie rooted in history or even legend, this is far from it. Film has lots of questionable material, making many viewers uncomfortable. Parents should be extremely wary. Also very long, a good number of students left before the movie ended, and i didn't hear a single good review. In fact, students Applauded upon the deaths of the major characters. i would have expected better from these well known actors. i wish i had the 3 hours of my life back."
